NEW YORK
The names of those 36 States should therefore not
appear on the ballot.
According to paragraph 4 of General Assembly
resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971, and taking
the number of States which will remain
into account
members of
the Council after 1 January 1994,
the 18
members should be elected as follows:
five from African
States; three from Asian States; one from Eastern European
States; four from Latin American and Caribbean States; and
five from Western European and other States. The ballot
papers reflect that pattern.
I
should like to inform the Assembly that
the
candidates, not exceeding the number of seats to be filled,
receiving the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds
majority of those present and voting will be declared elected.
In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be
a restricted ballot limited to those candidates which have
obtained an equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that
procedure?
It was so decided.
The PRESIDENT:
In accordance with rule 92 of the
rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret ballot,
and there shall be no nominations.
I shall now call upon representatives who wish to make
statements before we proceed to the election.
Mr. GHAFOORZAI (Afghanistan): Membership of the
Economic and Social Council is important, mainly for the
following two reasons. First, contributing to the activities of
different organs of the Organization is part of the collective

and Charter responsibilities of each Member State, in order
to employ international machinery for the promotion of the
economic and social advancement of all people. Secondly,
it is through membership of such organs that a Member
State can bring to the attention of the relevant Department
in the United Nations system its particular needs relating to
the promotion of social and economic programmes and a
better standard of life for its people.
Afghanistan, after 14 years of foreign domination and
occupation, is once again taking its place in this international
forum and is trying to participate actively in the activities of
the Organization. We consider that
to be our Charter
obligation.
States and in response to the kind efforts exerted by the
Asian Group’s Chairman to arrive at a list of candidatures
that agrees with the slate for the Group.
The PRESIDENT:
I call on the representative of
Zimbabwe, as Chairman of the Group of African States.
Mr. MUMBENGEGWI (Zimbabwe): My Head of
State, President Robert Gabriel Mugabe, has
already
expressed our pleasure at seeing you, Sir, preside over the
affairs of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly.
Allow me, nevertheless,
the honour and privilege, as
Chairman of the Group of African States for the month of
October, to reiterate his sentiments.
With regard to our particular problems and needs at this
very critical stage of our life as a war-stricken country, we
want to bring to the attention of the relevant organs of the
Organization, including the Economic and Social Council,
the particular needs of the Afghan nation, whose destruction
in the past 14 years of war may not have a parallel in
history.
In addition to losing 1.5 million of its population,
our country has lost its total economic infrastructure and is
faced with enormous economic, social, cultural, educational,
health and other multifaceted problems that have been left us
as a legacy of the former Soviet Union’s aggression against
our homeland.
Moreover, to ensure a balance in the representation of
interest groups in the Economic and Social Council,
Afghanistan concluded that membership of the Council
would appropriately ensure representation of
the least
developed and land-locked developing countries.
For these reasons, we submitted our candidature for
membership of the Economic and Social Council. However,
it was not convenient for the Group of Asian States to be
unable to arrive at an agreed slate and accordingly for there
to be contesting candidates. The delegation of the Islamic
State of Afghanistan, in a spirit of accommodation and to
facilitate the process of election of the Asian candidates for
membership of the Economic and Social Council, has
decided to withdraw this year. It is our earnest expectation
that Member States will give favourable consideration to
Afghanistan’s renewed candidature for 1995-1996.
Mr. SHAHEED (Syrian Arab Republic) (interpretation
from Arabic): Notwithstanding the generous support for our
candidature to membership on the Economic and Social
Council, which we deeply appreciate, my delegation should
like to announce that it does not insist on its candidature for
this year and that it wishes to postpone it till next year out
of a desire to maintain the unity of the Group of Asian
for
dialogue
constructive
international
The Economic and Social Council offers one of the best
forums
and
cooperation on the economic and social issues affecting our
regions and peoples. The violent upheavals and conflicts
that bedevil nations and regions are often to a large extent
manifestations of more deeply embedded economic and
social maladies. Thus, the interrelationship between peace
and socio-economic well-being cannot be overemphasized.
It
is our hope that
the awaited report
from the
Secretary-General on an agenda for development will give
the necessary impetus to the promotion of international
cooperation for social and economic advancement. The
African Group is ready to participate fully and constructively
to that end in the General Assembly and the Economic and
Social Council.
It
therefore gives me great pleasure to present
the
candidatures of Egypt, Ghana, Senegal, the United Republic
of Tanzania and Zimbabwe for election to the Economic and
Social Council. All these countries have been fully endorsed
by the African Group. On behalf of the Group, I commend
those five countries to the General Assembly for
its
consideration.
The PRESIDENT: I now call upon the representative
of Indonesia, as Chairman of the Group of Asian States.
Mr. WISNUMURTI (Indonesia): As Chairman of the
Asian Group for the month of October 1993, having heard
the statements of the representatives of Afghanistan and the
Syrian Arab Republic, I should like to inform the Assembly
that the following countries have decided to withdraw their
candidatures:
the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea, the Syrian Arab Republic and the United
Arab Emirates.

I should like to inform the Assembly that, despite the
gracious gestures of the countries I have just mentioned, the
Asian Group, regrettably, could not achieve an agreed slate.
The declared candidates from the Asian Group in the
elections to the Economic and Social Council for the period
1994-1996 are therefore as follows:
Indonesia, Japan,
Kazakhstan, Pakistan and Papua New Guinea.
The PRESIDENT: I now call on the representative of
the Russian Federation, as Chairman of the Group of Eastern
European States.
Mr. VORONTSOV (Russian Federation) (interpretation
from Russian): As Chairman of the Eastern European
Group, I should like to inform the Assembly that the Group
has endorsed the candidacy of Bulgaria for membership of
the Economic and Social Council, in the post to be filled by
our Group. We are convinced that Bulgaria’s participation
will enhance the practical effects of the work of the Council,
which will be undertaking major tasks resulting from the
new geopolitical and economic realities.
The PRESIDENT: I now call on the representative of
Cuba, as Chairman of the Group of Latin American and
Caribbean States.
Mr. ZAMORA (Cuba) (interpretation from Spanish):
The Latin American and Caribbean Group has always
attached great importance to the work of the Economic and
Social Council. As Chairman of the Group for the month of
October, I have the honour to inform the Assembly that for
the four positions to be filled from our region the Group has
endorsed the candidacies of Chile, Costa Rica, Paraguay and
Venezuela.
The PRESIDENT: I now call on the representative of
the Group of Western
New Zealand, as Chairman of
European and Other States.
Mr. KEATING (New Zealand): I am very pleased, on
behalf of the Group of Western European and Other States,
to advise the General Assembly that for the five positions to
be filled from our area on the Economic and Social Council
for the period beginning 1 January 1994 there are five
candidatures:
Ireland and
Portugal. These candidates have been fully endorsed by the
Group.
France, Germany, Greece,
Zimbabwe, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, Cuba and
New Zealand.
Ballot papers marked A, B, C, D and E will now be
distributed. I request representatives to use only those ballot
papers and to write on them the names of the States for
which they wish to vote.
A ballot paper containing more names from the relevant
region than the number of seats assigned to it will be
declared invalid. Should they appear on a ballot paper,
names of Member States which do not belong to that region
will not be counted at all.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Yahya (Brunei
Darussalam), Mrs. Valle Camino (Cuba), Mr. Silis
(Latvia), Ms. Iiyambo (Namibia) and Ms. Nicolaisen
(Norway) acted as tellers.
A vote was taken by secret ballot.

The following States, having obtained the required
two-thirds majority, were elected members of the Economic
and Social Council for a period of three years beginning
on 1 January 1994: Bulgaria, Chile, Costa Rica, Egypt,
France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Indonesia, Ireland,
Japan, Paraguay, Portugal, Senegal, United Republic of
Tanzania, Venezuela, Zimbabwe.
The PRESIDENT:
I congratulate the States which
have been elected members of the Economic and Social
Council.
Since one seat remains to be filled from among the
Asian States, we shall now proceed to the first restricted
ballot. This second round of balloting shall be restricted to
those two States from among the Asian States which were
not elected but obtained the largest number of votes in the
previous ballot, namely, Kazakhstan and Pakistan. This is
in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure.
Ballot papers will now be distributed.
I request
representatives to write on the ballot papers the name of the
State for which they wish to vote. Ballot papers will be
declared invalid if they contain the name of a State
33rd meeting - Thursday, 21 October 1993
other than Kazakhstan or Pakistan, or if they contain the
name of more than one State.

The PRESIDENT: This restricted ballot has been
inconclusive. In accordance with the rules of procedure, we
should continue the series of restricted ballots.
In view of
the lateness of the hour, however, I propose that further
