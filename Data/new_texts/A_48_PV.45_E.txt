session 
In  his  statement 
to  the  General  Assembly  of  the 
this  year,  President 
United  Nations  on  27  September 
Clinton  spoke  about  steps to  control  the  materials  needed 
for  nuclear  weapons production,  to  address issues related 
to  growing  global  stockpiles  of  plutonium  and  highly 
enriched  uranium,  and  to  encourage  all  nuclear  weapon

to  refrain 
its  traditional  safeguards functions. 
Current  nuclear  disarmament  measures,  as  well  as 
current reprocessing  of spent civilian  nuclear  fuel,  will  lead 
to  substantial  quantities  of plutonium  and highly  enriched 
uranium  -  that 
is  to  say,  materials  usable  for  nuclear 
weapons -which  will  have to  be safely and securely stored 
before  they  are put  to  peaceful  use or otherwise  disposed 
of.  Concerns  about  the  safety  and  security  of  such 
materials  might  be  alleviated  by  devising 
specific 
confidence-building  measures which States could enter into 
either  unilaterally  or multilaterally.  The  IAEA  has initiated 
some  preliminary  work  in  seeking  to  identify  some  of the 
problems  and  possible  methods  for  managing  plutonium 
and highly  enriched  uranium. 
A  verified  cut-off  for the production  of plutonium  and 
highly  enriched  uranium  for  weapons or  other  explosive 
purposes has been under  international  discussion for  many 
years.  However,  the  present  international  climate  gives 
grounds  for  hope  that  that  discussion  could  lead  to  an 
agreement  involving  all  States  on  an  equal  basis.  The 
verification  arrangements  needed  to  underpin  such  an 
agreement  would  entail  great challenges, having  necessarily 
to  focus  on  the  largest  and  most  complex  of  nuclear 
installations,

Mr.  WLOSOWICZ 
(Poland):  At  the  outset  I  should 
like  to  express Poland’s  deep  appreciation  of  the  work  of 
the  Director  General  of  the  International  Atomic  Energy 
Agency  (IAEA)  and  its  highly  competent  staff.  This  has 
been  a particularly  challenging  year,  in  which  the  IAEA 
has performed  very well. The  exemplary  manner  in  which 
the  Director  General,  Mr.  Hans  Blix,  has been  conducting 
the  work  of  his  Agency  merits  our  gratitude  and  respect, 
It  therefore  gives  me  great  satisfaction 
to  convey  to  the 
Director  General  my  delegation’s  heartfelt  congratulations 
on his  reappointment 
to  another  term  of  office.

through  the  application  of  the  IAEA  safeguards  to  all  such
