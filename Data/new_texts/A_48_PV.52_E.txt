I have communicated the result of the vote to the
President of the Security Council, and, in turn, I have
received from the President of the Security Council the
following letter:
"I have the honour to inform you that at
the
the Security Council, held on

beginning
Since no candidate has obtained an absolute majority in
both organs, it will be necessary, in accordance with the
provisions of article 11 of the Statute of the Court, to hold
a third meeting to fill the remaining vacancy. I propose that
this meeting should be adjourned and that the third meeting
should be held immediately to vote on the remaining
vacancy.
The meeting rose at 6.35 p.m.
