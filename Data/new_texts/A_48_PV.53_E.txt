PLENARY MEETING
Wednesday, 10 November 1993
at 6.35 p.m.
NEW YORK
Therefore, any announcements such as those concerning
withdrawals of candidatures should be made prior to the
commencement of the voting process - that is, before the
distribution of the ballot papers.
I call on the representative of Cape Verde.
Mr. JESUS (Cape Verde):
In connection with the
current elections, I thought that any candidate should come
within the criteria set forth in the Statute of the Court.
There is no such criterion as any particular legal system as
applied to a region.
I have followed these elections throughout, paying close
attention to the results of the several ballots, and I have
come to the conclusion that, although I still have a strong
majority in the Security Council - nine votes, as in the first
ballot - I should not put all members through the pain of
having to spend more time here tonight. Accordingly, I
believe that I should withdraw my candidature at this stage.
I should like to pay tribute to all those who over the
past year have been willing to meet with me and listen when
I lobbied in support of my candidature. My special thanks
go to all of them - in particular, the national groups of the
12 countries that endorsed my candidature - for the honour
they gave me.
I am also grateful to all those who, time and again,
stuck with me and voted in favour of my candidature, either
in the General Assembly or in the Security Council.
The PRESIDENT: In the light of the statement of the
representative of Cape Verde, his name will be deleted from
the ballot paper. I thank him for his magnanimous gesture.
This record is subject to correction.
Corrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned
within one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section,
Room C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record.
Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.
