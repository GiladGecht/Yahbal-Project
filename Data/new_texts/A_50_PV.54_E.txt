Mr. Pallais Arana (Nicaragua) (interpretation from
Spanish): I am honoured, on behalf of the delegations of
Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama and
Nicaragua, to open the debate on the item “The situation in
Central America: procedures for the establishment of a firm
and lasting peace and progress in fashioning a region of
peace, freedom, democracy and development”.
Only a few years ago, Central America was a region
overwhelmed by social upheaval, war, authoritarianism
and the dominance of military might over civil society.
Only a few years ago, our region was a focus of the
East-West conflict, and much of
the cooperation it
received from outside and a large proportion of our
national budgets were earmarked for military expenditures
in the region. This had the effect of deepening military
conflict and bringing about economic and social decline.
Just a few years ago, we, and perhaps many of the
other members here, were sceptical about the possibility
of Central America enjoying democracy, peace and
freedom on the road to sustainable development
that
proclaimed the dignity of the human being as one of its
main objectives.
Today we are deeply gratified to see that the efforts
that we in Central America and the international
community have made to build a new Central America
have dispelled this scepticism. Today we are convinced
that the enormous efforts invested in finding a solution to
the crisis in Central America have not been in vain, nor
are we back where we started, with another conflict about
to ignite.

struggle for peace and eradicate war, to ensure that dialogue
prevailed over violence and reason over rancour, to give
impetus to real democratic processes, and to promote justice
and respect for human rights.
Today we can say that in the 1990s, with the end of
the cold war and the breakdown of totalitarianism, an
unprecedented opportunity presented itself to change the
course of history and, for the first time, to secure the values
of a democratic, just, peaceful, civil and reconciled society,
with Governments brought to power by the freely expressed
will of the people.
When,
in December 1990,
the Central American
Presidents declared Central America a region of peace,
freedom, democracy and development, there was also some
scepticism about that. Nevertheless, it was not simply a
rhetorical declaration. At that time, we were conscious and
fully understood that we were undertaking an ambitious,
far-reaching and detailed project.
In considering the question of Central America, the
General Assembly has been witness to the developments in
the situation in our subregion. The international community
has been able to ascertain through its own experience and
at various summits that the Central American Presidents

The new integration of Central America is a
fundamental and indispensable instrument for regional
development and hence for ensuring peace, security and
democracy in our region. In this context, the main priorities
in Central America have been defined, not only from the
political and economic but also from the social standpoint.
Today Central America has defined its new regional
strategy in the Alliance for Sustainable Development in
Central America. This new strategy was agreed upon in the
Declaration of Guacimo approved in Costa Rica in August
1994 and the document signed at the Managua Environment
Summit
the International
Conference on Peace and Development, held a few days
later in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.
in October 1994, and at
We think we should also bring to the Assembly’s
attention the signing at the sixteenth meeting of Central
American Presidents, held in El Salvador in March 1995,
of the Treaty on Central American Social Integration,
which, as an integral part of the new Central American
strategy, is aimed at giving priority to social matters so as
to ensure sustainable human development.

54th plenary meeting
9 November 1995
As a complement to the legal bases and values of
the integration process in the new Central America, the
Central American Presidents have proposed to discuss at
the impending summit, to be held in San Pedro Sula,
Honduras, an agreement on democratic security —
namely, security in its integral sense — an agreement
based on the conviction that full and effective democracy
is the best means for promoting trust between nations and
citizens.
The new principles of regional integration are based
on respect for life in all its forms; constant improvements
in the quality of life; respect for the vitality and diversity
of our land; peace, participatory democracy; respect for
and the promotion and protection of human rights, and
respect for the multiculturalism and ethnic diversity of our
peoples; the economic integration of our region with the
rest of
the world; and a responsibility that spans
generations for sustainable development.
Within this new plan for regional integration, the
new Central American Integration System (SICA) is the
basic framework for such integration, as a means to
harmonize efforts in the economic, social, cultural and
political development spheres in Central America in order
to consolidate the interdependence of democracy, security
and development, inseparable elements of a new pattern
of Central American security. For this, Central America
wishes to thank the General Assembly for granting
observer status to the Central American Integration
System (SICA) on 12 October 1995.
In our efforts to ensure peace and sustainable
development in our region, we can say that in Central
America confrontation and military solutions to conflicts
are a thing of the past. We believe in the application of
the principle of the peaceful solution of disputes,
in
dialogue and in negotiation. Central America favours and
supports international law. In this spirit, Central America
supports the good-offices role of the Secretary-General
and the development of United Nations peace-keeping
operations within the framework of the Agenda for Peace.

certain that the Guatemalan people will be equal to the task
demanded by the times and that the negotiating process in
which they are involved will be successful.
In El Salvador, the process initiated as a result of the
peace agreements between the Government of El Salvador
and the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional
is still moving forward, and its success has contributed to
the progress in the transition the country is experiencing.
We are pleased with the renewal of the mandate of the

In Nicaragua, the experience of the support group
made up of Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain and
Sweden, in accordance with resolutions 48/161 and 49/137,
has shown that the United Nations is able to take innovative
initiatives to support the processes of transition to peace,
democracy and development; this is shown also by the
adequate levels of technical and financial support given to
our country in the preparation of a strategy for national
development.
At
the International Colloquium on Post-Conflict
Reconstruction Strategies, held in Austria in June 1995, it
was stated that
there must be a broad response to a
country’s needs in consolidating peace after a conflict. This
was a particular challenge for the United Nations system,
whose main objective is the integration of activities much
more than the simple coordination of activities. At that
Colloquium, emphasis was placed on giving a human face
to the process, as well as on the situation and the standards
of living of peoples whose lives had been devastated by the
war and who had had great expectations of a “peace
dividend”.

agree with
The Secretary-General, by introducing in his Agenda
for Peace the new element of the consolidation of peace
after conflicts, has brought an important critical vision to
the global framework of United Nations activities for peace.
By introducing this new concept, he has broken the old
model that limited United Nations activities to the mere

cessation of hostilities and the ending of armed
confrontations.
As the Secretary-General has stated, it is now a
question of dealing with the very causes of the conflict
and not merely with their superficial manifestations. We
must now put an end to the deeper roots of crises —
economic despair, social injustice and political oppression.
Once again, Central America bears witness to the
fact that these concepts can become a reality. Central
America is convinced that our region offers the conditions
necessary to make it a model for the solution of conflicts
— solutions by which peace and democracy are
consolidated through integral developments and through
political settlements that include the elements necessary
for establishing the interdependency of “An Agenda for
Peace” and an “An Agenda for Development”. This task
has not yet been concluded.
Central America feels that just as the International
Conference on Central American Refugees (CIREFCA)
and the Economic Cooperation Plan for Central America
(PEC) served as an example to be applied in other
situations, Central America will also be a successful
example of what the United Nations can do, with the
support of
the international community and while
respecting the sovereignty and independence of States, in
the field of consolidating peace and using preventive
diplomacy to end conflicts.

Central America — the subject of the Secretary-General’s
report in document A/50/534 — provides us with an
adequate framework for the United Nations and the
international community to continue to cooperate with
Central America.
To conclude, we wish to acknowledge once again
that on the road we have travelled we have not been
alone and that the contribution of the United Nations, the
international community and, in particular, those countries
that have constantly supported us, has been essential in
consolidating peace in our region.
In presenting the draft
resolution contained in
document A/50/L.17, we wish to direct the Assembly’s

request for observers for the electoral process in 1996. At
the same time, we wish to bring the Assembly up to date
on the most recent efforts undertaken by Central America
in the peace and regional integration processes.
We have gone most of the way, and yet much remains
to be done to achieve the goals we have set for ourselves.
We insist on the need to overcome extreme poverty, for
which greater efforts are required. We hope that in this task
the international community and the United Nations will
continue their cooperation with Central America and that
the draft resolution that we have submitted will be adopted
by consensus.
Mr. Albin (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish):
Mexico has very close and fruitful relations with the
countries of Central America. We are bound not only
geographically but also by close historical and cultural ties.
Central America has always been of prime importance in
the international affairs of my country. We have followed
with particular attention the positive developments which
have taken place in the region in recent years, and we
welcome the determined efforts of the countries in the
region to strengthen their institutions and to achieve firm
and lasting peace.
The signing in Mexico City by the Government of
Guatemala and the Unidad Nacional Revolucionaria
Guatemalteca (UNRG) of the Agreement on Identity and
Rights of the Indigenous People, and the negotiations to
conclude an agreement on socio-economic aspects and the
agrarian situation constitute very important progress in the

The extension of the mandate of the United Nations

We are well aware of the efforts made by the
Nicaraguan people to counteract the consequences of war

will continue to participate in the Nicaragua Support Group
and in bilateral cooperation.

Mr. Murayama (Japan): It is recalled that the United
Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) was
established in 1991 to help guide El Salvador towards the
creation of a society in which democratic order, the rule of

successfully completed its tasks this past April. Looking
back at
the history of United Nations peace-keeping
operations in Central America, beginning in 1989 with the
United Nations Observer Group in Central America
(ONUCA) and followed in 1990 by the United Nations
Observer Mission to Verify the Electoral Process in
Nicaragua (ONUVEN), both of which were in Nicaragua,
and then by ONUSAL in El Salvador, I believe we can
confidently proclaim them to have been enormously
successful.
I should like to take this opportunity to pay high
tribute to the peoples of El Salvador and Nicaragua, whose
strength of will and indomitable spirit made the ideals of
peace and democracy a reality in their societies. Let me
also commend the various United Nations organs and
agencies for their innovative and very effective efforts to
fulfil their important mandates.
In an effort to build upon the success of peace-keeping
operations following the completion of their mandates, the
Foreign Ministers of Japan and the Central American
countries agreed at the United Nations Headquarters this
September to establish a Japan-Central America forum to
promote dialogue and cooperation on a range of issues in

political, economic and cultural areas. Japan hopes that
the forum, to be convened once a year, will help it gain
a greater understanding of the real needs of the region so
as to ensure that its cooperative efforts are as effective as
possible.
As I mentioned earlier, thanks to the enthusiasm of
its people and the assistance of the United Nations, El
Salvador has continued to make progress in building a
democratic society, particularly since the successful
general election that was held there last year. This is not
to say, however, that the implementation of the peace
agreements has not been fraught with problems and
delays. We have yet

to see,
In this context, Japan strongly supports the efforts of
the Mission of
the United Nations in El Salvador
(MINUSAL), which, under the able leadership of Mr.
Enrique ter Horst, commenced its work this past May to
follow up the international peace-keeping effort
in
El Salvador. I should like to emphasize on this occasion
that the valiant people of El Salvador need and deserve
continued assistance from the international community as
they rebuild their country. Japan, for one, is providing
ever greater support for that effort. It does so in the
conviction that through their unwavering commitment to
peace and democratic principles,
the people of El
Salvador will demonstrate to the international community
that the concept of peace-building is in fact a viable one.
The vigilant attention and consistent efforts of the
international community are required in other parts of the
region as well. I should like in particular to touch upon
the situation in Guatemala, which has seen the longest
conflict in Central America’s history.
Negotiations between the Government of Guatemala
and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca
(URNG) are being conducted under the auspices of the
United Nations. While progress in those talks has been
uneven, we are encouraged by the establishment of the
United Nations Mission for the Verification of Human
Rights and of Compliance with the Commitments of the
Comprehensive Agreement
in
Guatemala (MlNUGUA), and by the signing of the
Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous People.
The presidential-election campaign is now entering its
final stage. In just a few days, on Sunday, 12 November,

the election will finally be held. It will represent
culmination of patient and protracted efforts over the past
30 years of all the parties concerned.
In view of the significance of this election, Japan has
decided to contribute a grant of $100,000 to the
Organization of American States (OAS) to be used for
election-monitoring purposes. It will also participate in
monitoring activities, coordinating its efforts with OAS. It
is Japan’s earnest hope that this election will create an
atmosphere that will be conducive to further and speedy
progress in the negotiations so that a final peace agreement
may be concluded and ready for signing early in 1996.
Japan highly commends the United Nations, and
particularly MINUGUA, as well as the members of the
Secretary-General’s Group of Friends of the Guatemalan
Peace Process, without whose efforts such progress would
not be possible.
I would be less than candid if I did not acknowledge
the fact that numerous obstacles remain on the path to
peace and democracy in Central America. But we must not
be discouraged. Rather, we should redouble our efforts to
overcome these problems by combining peace-keeping and
peace-building activities in new and creative ways.
It is in this context that Japan is extending various
kinds of medium- and long-term cooperation to the
countries of Central America, including yen loans, general
grant aid and technical assistance. It has also responded
promptly and generously to the need for emergency relief
in the wake of natural disasters that have occurred in the
region. Should any new emergency arise, Japan stands
ready to provide assistance, in the belief that its assistance
not only facilitates economic development and provides
humanitarian relief, but that it helps to advance the peace
process and ensures that any progress will be irreversible.
I wish to conclude my remarks today with a word of
gratitude to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for
the indispensable role he has played in the struggle to
restore peace and stability throughout Central America. The
coordination of United Nations efforts with the initiatives
of like-minded countries in the region has demonstrated
new ways in which peace-keeping and peace-building may
be effectively combined and has provided a model for
future endeavours in this area. I should therefore like to
urge the United Nations to continue to pursue its innovative
peace-building activities in the region, for I believe that
through its experiences in Central America it is gaining

Mr. Fedotov (Russian Federation) (interpretation
from Russian): The Russian Federation notes with
satisfaction that after many years of armed conflict and
instability Central America is today at
the stage of
consolidating the peace process, strengthening democratic
institutions and economic revival. Despite considerable
difficulties,
the process of national reconciliation and
democratization in the Central American region is, on the
whole, proceeding successfully and has already led to a
considerable relaxation of tension there.

The Russian Federation takes a positive view of the
activities of the United Nations missions in El Salvador
and Guatemala and supported the further extension of
their mandates. We welcome the constructive cooperation
between the United Nations and the Organization of
American States (OAS) and other regional organizations
on this question.
The Russian Federation is pleased and gratified by
the success of the peace process in El Salvador. The
experience of the 45-month multipurpose peace-keeping
operation has shown that tolerance and perseverance in
seeking paths to settlement and reaching agreements can
succeed in resolving the most complex and protracted
conflicts — provided, of course, that the parties involved
genuinely desire to achieve a durable peace.
We note the generally constructive course of
implementation of the Chapultepec Peace Agreement,
which has
furthered the trend towards a logical
stabilization of the situation in El Salvador. At the same
time, certain unresolved problems remain. The Russian
Federation attaches great importance to the fact that a
comprehensive approach to post-conflict peace-building is
now required in El Salvador, with close cooperation
between El Salvador and the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP), other United Nations specialized
agencies and international financial institutions.
General Assembly
Fiftieth session
Notwithstanding the remaining complexities and the
recurrent outbreaks of violence recently seen in Guatemala,
the signature by the Government and the leadership of the
Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) of
a whole series of agreements has created a real basis for
success in achieving a peaceful settlement in the near future
in that country. The most important requirements for further
progress are the strict compliance of both parties with the
obligations they have already entered into and the taking of
decisive and effective steps to ensure the protection of
human rights, and in particular the safety of the civilian
population. We hope that on the basis of the agreements
reached, and with mutual goodwill, the Government and the
URNG will do everything possible to reach specific
agreements shortly on the unresolved issues that remain. In
this connection we call upon both parties to complete the
process of national reconciliation by signing the relevant
documents during the term of the present administration —
that is, prior to January 1996.
We welcome the efforts of
the Government of
Nicaragua to consolidate civil peace and to improve the
socio-economic situation in the country. The resolution of
the recent political differences between the executive and
legislative authorities has demonstrated the country’s desire
and ability to find solutions to the remaining problems. The
important point now is to ensure that all necessary
conditions are met for the general elections to be held in
Nicaragua in accordance with the time-table set out in the
Constitution, which will
further enhance the regular
evolution of the democratization process.
The Russian Federation welcomes the positive impact
on the situation in Central America of the growing political
and economic cooperation between the countries of the
subregion within the framework of the Central American
Integration System, and the new momentum given it by the
decision to meet in October of this year at Costa del Sol, El
Salvador. The Russian Federation supported the proposal
that the Central American Integration System be granted
observer status in the General Assembly and was one of the
sponsors of the resolution concerned.
At
the same time,
it should be noted that
the
stabilization process in the subregion is still proceeding at
an uneven pace. Many of the social and economic problems
that were formerly the cause of conflicts remain to be
solved, and there is evidence of serious political difficulties
and of deliberate resistance on the part of certain radical
groups. The world community must continue to afford
effective assistance to the Central American countries in
averting new outbreaks of tension, in ensuring that the
54th plenary meeting
9 November 1995
processes of national reconciliation in the subregion are
irreversible by creating solid democratic bases for State
structures,
in strengthening the climate of political
tolerance, in the strict observance of human rights, and in
their economic recovery.
The Russian Federation has repeatedly put forward
initiatives designed to strengthen international support for
these processes in Central America. We have stated our
readiness to participate in the demining of former war
zones being carried out in the Central American States
under the auspices of OAS. The Russian Federation is
prepared to continue to provide assistance in the final
settlement of the problems of Central America and to
cooperate actively to that end with the countries of the
subregion and with all interested extra-regional States. We
also favour
the United
Nations role in that peacemaking process.

The European Union is following with great interest

progress that that American region is making year by year
towards the establishment of a firm and lasting peace and
in fashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and
development, so that it can emerge as an example of
harmony and integration for the rest of the international
community.
The peace initiative of Esquipulas, advanced in
1987, paved the way for mediation processes that made
it possible to go about resolving the cruel armed conflicts
that devastated various countries of the region. The
participation of the international community, through the
significant presence of the United Nations and the useful
work of the mechanism of the Group of Friends, has
facilitated, and continues to facilitate, a positive outcome
of the peace processes.

General Assembly
Fiftieth session
Within the framework of the region, the European
Union welcomes the positive evaluation, contained in the
Secretary-General’s report (A/50/499) of 3 October 1995,
of the work of the Support Group for Nicaragua, in which
three members of the Union participate. Its task is to follow
Nicaragua’s transition and to support the process of internal
consensus-building, with a view to economic and social
development. The elections of October 1996 will be a new
and important stage in the consolidation of democracy and
the foundations of Nicaragua’s reconstruction.
Notwithstanding the achievements made, important
measures still need to be adopted in order to consolidate the
peace processes in Guatemala and El Salvador.
The elections to be held next 12 November
in
Guatemala, with the participation of all the political forces
and in the spirit of the recent Contadora Declaration, will
enable the people of Guatemala to join in the movement of
peace, democracy and development that Central America is
experiencing. States members of the European Union are
sending observers to the elections, and those observers will
work in conjunction with the mission of the United Nations
and the mission of the Organization of American States.
In the statement made by its Presidency on 12
October, the European Union strongly condemned the tragic
events that took place on 5 October in the town of Chisec,
Department of Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, and demanded
that there be an immediate investigation and that those
responsible be punished. The European Union appreciates
the measures announced by the President of the Republic
and is following very closely the investigation being carried
out by the United Nations in respect of those events.
The European Union considers that full respect of the
population’s human rights is essential for the participation
of all the people of Guatemala in the elections and for the
success of the peace process. Particularly in the rural areas,
this means that the Voluntary Civil Defence Committees
must refrain from any action that might jeopardize the
climate of peace that is necessary for the successful holding
of the elections.
The General Assembly recently extended the mandate
of the United Nations Mission for the Verification of
Human Rights and of Compliance with the Commitments
of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights in
Guatemala (MINUGUA) for an additional period of six
months, until 18 March 1996. The European Union
considers that,
thanks to the mediation efforts and the
presence of MINUGUA on the ground, the United Nations

54th plenary meeting

is contributing actively and positively to the Guatemalan
peace process, helping and encouraging the parties to
reach a firm and lasting peace,
through national
reconciliation,
thus making it possible to lay the
foundations of democracy and development in a climate
of liberty and justice. The European Union urges both
parties to comply with their commitments under the
Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights and to
implement MINUGUA’s recommendations.
the United Nations
Just a few days ago, on 31 October 1995,
the
General Assembly took another important decision, also
supported by the European Union:
it adopted the
Secretary-General’s proposal to extend the mandate of the
Mission of
in El Salvador
(MINUSAL) for six months. We welcome the cooperation
between MINUSAL and the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) in the consolidation of the Peace
Accords, and we hope that it will be further strengthened
during the coming months. As the process proceeds, El
Salvador will need to give more emphasis to its long-term
development.
The European Union considers this necessary not
only because of
the important political message of
encouragement this decision sends to El Salvador, but
also because we are concerned that some elements of the
Peace Accords are not being fully implemented and others
have been considerably delayed. Swifter progress is
needed to avoid undermining the peace process and
causing political and social instability.

General Assembly
Fiftieth session
The European Union has considered the report
(A/50/499) of the Secretary-General of 3 October 1995 on
the situation in Central America. As Central America
advances towards the consolidation and reinforcement of its
democratic institutions,
the General Assembly and the
Economic and Social Council are proving to be appropriate
forums for considering the evolution of the region. In this
way the various cooperation and integration mechanisms
have an opportunity to prove their validity for the benefit
of the peoples in the region.
In this context, we want to encourage the Secretary-
General to continue to coordinate and stimulate all United
Nations organs to assist,
through the various ongoing
programmes, in the economic and social development of
Central America and to support the important initiatives for
greater integration being promoted by the countries of the
region. In that connection, we take a positive view of the
General Assembly’s recent granting of observer status to
the Central American Integration System.
Of the many initiatives taken, we would like to
underline two that we consider particularly important and
that show a sincere will for Central American integration.
First, we wish to note the efforts made by the Central
American countries with a view to a coherent strategy of
development, which is given form in the Alliance for
Sustainable Development, with an emphasis on collective
efforts to reduce poverty in the isthmus through social
integration, human development,
in human
resources and environmental protection.
investment
Secondly,
in a region that has suffered years of
military tensions,
the elaboration of an agreement on
regional security issues is commendable. This is currently
under discussion, the aim being to define a security model
that would make use of democratic institutions to find
comprehensive and peaceful solutions to the problems of
the region. This initiative reflects important changes in the
armed forces, significant changes that put us on the right
path to defining a new model for regional defence that
respects human rights and strengthens the rule of law and
the comprehensive development of human beings and
society.
The European Union wishes
reaffirm its
determination to continue to support the Central American
integration process and the new efforts aimed at stimulating
the comprehensive development of the region.

54th plenary meeting
9 November 1995
The eleventh annual Ministerial Conference on
political dialogue and economic cooperation between the
European Union and the States of the San José Group
was held in Panama City in February 1995. The
participants in the Conference welcomed the progress
made in the peace process,
in the consolidation of
democracy and respect for human rights and in the
development and integration of the Central American
region. They also stressed the positive effect on the
process of 10 years of exceptionally fruitful dialogue
between the two regions.
During the months leading up to the Conference, the
two sides had a number of contacts and agreed on the
necessity to adapt the substance and format of the San
José dialogue to the new circumstances created by the
profound changes of recent years, both in the European
Union and in Central America. The eleventh San José
Conference, representing a major step in that direction,
was devoted to three topics: sustainable development in
Central America, regional integration and the integration
of Central America in the international economy and,
finally, the future of relations between Central America
and the European Union.
is
The San José dialogue has proved to be a lively
mechanism of exchange and mutual understanding
between the European Union and the countries of Central
America. This dialogue, given the important changes in
the region,
serving to reorient and strengthen
cooperation with Central America, which will enable us
to face together with even greater vitality the challenges
of the years to come. The areas we consider particularly
important have to do with consolidating the rule of law,
strengthening democratic mechanisms, deepening social
stabilization and harmoniously introducing the Central
American countries into the international economy. In this
context, I would like to recall that the European Union
and its member States as a whole constitute the primary
donor to the cause of cooperation in the region.
The European Union trusts that during this session
of the General Assembly Central America will be able to
secure the ongoing peace processes in order to consolidate
achievements in the quest for lasting peace, democracy
and development, and in this endeavour it should enjoy
the assistance, solidarity and encouragement of
the
international community. The European Union will
continue to play an active role in this effort.

item 45, entitled “The situation in Central America:
procedures for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace
and progress in fashioning a region of peace, freedom,
democracy and development”, which is before the
Assembly today.
We have studied the report of the Secretary-General
on this subject, contained in document A/50/499, and the
third report of the Director of the United Nations Mission
for the Verification of Human Rights and of Compliance
with the Commitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on
Human Rights in Guatemala (MINUGUA), contained in
document A/50/482.
We share the Secretary-General’s positive outlook,
which is based on the prospect of the region’s being free of
armed conflicts and effecting institutional changes capable
of supporting new programmes of social and economic
reforms that will make it possible to consolidate sustainable
development. We

With regard to the latter report, we share the concern
over the situation of Guatemala and, in accordance with the
declaration of the most recent Ibero-American summit, we
support the efforts of its Government and urge the parties
to achieve a solid and lasting peace. My country wishes to
reiterate its resolute policy of encouragement
the
Guatemalan peace process, which has been aptly reflected
in our co-sponsorship of resolution 48/267, establishing
MINUGUA, and, more recently, of resolution 49/236 B,
extending its mandate for six months.
for
The Central American region is not exempt from the
global tendencies emerging since the end of the cold war.
It is striving for active regionalization and the consolidation
of societies in which peace reigns, freedom is a reality,
democracy is the norm and sustainable economic and social
development are a real possibility. Its Governments are
aware that the search for these values will contribute to the
consolidation of a situation of well-being and stability in
the region.
For its part, the international community takes note
that the Central American region is overcoming a difficult
period of internal conflict and entering a new era of
institutional reconstruction and economic development. The
consolidation of
this process calls for solidarity and
cooperation, which can be fuelled by financial support, both
multilateral and bilateral. Only in this way will
it be
10

possible to give impetus to investment and, as a result,
growth.
In the context of assistance, it would be particularly
desirable to pour in the economic and technical assistance
that will be required to face the difficult situations that
armed conflicts always leave in their wake.
My country has given concrete proof of its clear
commitment
to this philosophy, both in the peace
processes and in initiatives such as the signing of
technical-cooperation agreements in the areas of human
resources, agriculture, forest management, fishing and
energy, as well as in the renegotiation of external debt —
especially public debt. In the conviction that recovery and
economic development are essential conditions for the
consolidation of peace and democracy in this region, my
country has allotted for Central America 46 per cent of
the total amount for projects agreed upon through the
Argentine fund for horizontal cooperation, making Central
America the fund’s principal beneficiary worldwide.
We have made concrete contributions to both
military and civilian participation in the peace-keeping
operations deployed in the region, as well as in the areas
of human rights and electoral assistance.
In this spirit, we wish to renew our commitment to
the Central American region, whose peoples are such
close kin of our own.
Mr. Fowler (Canada): Canada values highly the
work of the United Nations in assisting the peoples and
Governments of Central America in achieving democracy
and development. The respect in which the Organization
is held in Central America has allowed it to assist the
Governments and peoples of Central America to achieve
important objectives. Over the last 10 years Canada has
supported all of the United Nations initiatives, usually in
direct and material ways. We have contributed military
and police personnel to the United Nations Observer
Group in Central America (ONUCA), the United Nations
Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) and the
United Nations Mission for the Verification of Human
Rights and of Compliance with the Commitments of the
Comprehensive Agreement

MINUSAL to do in the verification of the implementation

however, that MINUSAL must not be extended indefinitely,
and we encourage the Government of El Salvador to
redouble its efforts to ensure the prompt, transparent and
thorough implementation of its commitments under the
peace accords.
During the last two years, Canada has participated in
the Nicaragua Support Group. We think that this new and
very low-cost form of preventive diplomacy has been useful
in assisting the Government and people of Nicaragua in
conducting a dialogue on critical economic and political
issues.
Canada is encouraged by the achievements to date in

We have read carefully the three reports of the

reported in the second report were important and
encouraging for the peace process in Guatemala. On the
other hand, the situation reported in MINUGUA’s third
report and the subsequent massacre at Xaman, in Alta
Verapaz, give rise to renewed concern. We urge the
Government of Guatemala and other concerned parties to
consider seriously the recommendations of MINUGUA and
to work hard to give them effect, particularly with regard
to the problem of impunity. For its part, Canada will
continue to support MINUGUA and the peace negotiations.

One of
the most encouraging developments in
Central America is the continuing trend towards political
and institutional cooperation and economic integration
reported to us by the Secretary-General. One of the fruits
of this process, the Alliance for Sustainable Development,
can serve Central Americans as an effective tool in their
pursuit of economic and social development and of
integration with the global economy. During his meeting
with the Central American leaders in San José in January
1995, Prime Minister Chrétien demonstrated his support
for the Alliance and other Central American initiatives
towards regional cooperation. He has expressed a strong
interest in maintaining high-level consultations on this
issue.

While the parties to the conflict meet for a new round
of negotiations in Mexico, Guatemala is preparing for
elections which hopefully will strengthen the country’s
democratic institutions. Sectors that traditionally have not
taken an active part in the electoral process have on this
occasion opted for a more positive approach. The electorate
has a wider choice of political alternatives, and the URNG
has been encouraging the Guatemalans to take advantage of
their right to vote. Their unilateral cease-fire in the two
weeks prior
to the elections has also been a very
constructive measure. It is extremely important that the new
president and the major political parties in the new national
assembly feel a commitment to the peace process. The
Contadora Declaration of August augurs well
in that
respect, but the victors should be invited to reassure their
fellow countrymen and the international community about
their favourable attitude after the elections also.
The establishment and deployment of the United
Nations Mission for the Verification of Human Rights
(MINUGUA) represents a significant step forward in the
peace process. The presence of MINUGUA has given
renewed hope to the civilian population that peace, justice,
reconstruction and reconciliation may become a reality in
Guatemala, but the mission can be a success only if the
authorities act
sincerely and wholeheartedly on the
MINUGUA recommendations.
Norway, for its part, has stepped up considerably its
assistance to Guatemala over the past two years, with a
projected total in 1995 of roughly $11 million, which is
slightly higher than last year. A contribution to MINUGUA
of $1 million is especially aimed at reforms in the judicial
system and translation to Mayan languages and distribution
of the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous
Peoples. Special priority continues to be given to projects
related to democratization and political development and to
particularly vulnerable groups, with special emphasis on the
indigenous population. Norway has also made a point of
establishing good contacts with all relevant actors in the

social and political landscape of Guatemala and we have
made clear to the negotiating parties that we are prepared
to contribute further to specific peace-related needs that
may arise during the negotiating process.
The Government Peace Commission and the URNG
now seem to have a realistic approach to the peace
negotiations. It is imperative that the various sectors of
Guatemalan society display the same constructive spirit,
including those that may have to renounce some of their
privileges in order to create a better tomorrow for all
Guatemalans. Peace is a necessary first step before the
entire people of Guatemala can join efforts in this noble
venture. Massive participation in the elections on Sunday
would be encouraging testimony to the fact
the
Guatemalans, through peaceful and democratic means, are
ready to take their destiny in their own hands. And the
United Nations and the Group of Friends will continue to
be the firmest allies of a Guatemala that is staking its
future on peace and reconciliation.
that
The signature of the Chapultepec Peace Agreement
in El Salvador in 1993 initiated a fruitful process of
peace-building in that country to which the United
Nations has contributed substantially. For Norway, it has
been natural to participate in and contribute to the United
Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) and
the Mission of
the United Nations in El Salvador
(MINUSAL) as well as in the training of the new
National Civil Police of El Salvador.
Important parts of the Chapultepec Agreement are,
however, still not fully accomplished. This is notably the
case for such matters as the distribution of land and
judicial and electoral reforms. We therefore hope that the
Government of El Salvador will
take the necessary
measures to assure the implementation of the Peace
Agreement in letter as well as in spirit.
In its evaluation of
the public security sector,
MINUSAL is reporting a number of problems in the new
National Civil Police as well as in the Police Academy.
We believe that a well-organized,
independent police
force that respects human rights is fundamental for the
further consolidation of the peace process in EL Salvador.
The
limits given by
MINUSAL in its report should be complied with by the
Salvadoran authorities.

Free and democratic elections in 1996 will signify a
worthy end to the first transition period after the civil war.
Norway hopes that elections will be held as programmed in
October next year so that a new President and a new
Government can initiate the second stage of the democratic
transition in January 1997.
Nicaragua has managed to reduce substantially its
commercial foreign debt and bilateral debt. Hopefully, this
lessening of the debt burden will improve the economic
situation of the country. Nicaragua will, however, still need
support from the international community to be able to
develop further. Nicaragua is Norway’s only programme
country in Latin America, and is the most
important
recipient of Norwegian development assistance on the
continent. Bilateral assistance will amount to approximately
$27 million in 1995. We are prepared to maintain the
assistance to Nicaragua, but would like to emphasize that
international assistance can only be a supplement
to
national efforts to assure continued positive social and
economic progress in the country.
Mr. Laing (Belize): In the same way as the Belize
delegation did last year, as a good neighbour we must lend
our full support
to draft resolution A/50/L.17 on the
situation in Central America. We are happy to observe that
during the past 12 months our delicate, filigreed isthmus
has remained largely stable. In no small measure, this is
due to the strenuous efforts of persons of good will in
Central America as well as to the labours of the Secretary-
General of this Organization.

We are grateful,
the flood of displaced
persons crossing the subregion’s borders for safety and
greater prosperity from some areas has been stemmed.
Regrettably, from some other areas the tide continues, with
serious effects on host countries, including mine.
Yet, overall, we are quite optimistic at the rate of
progress in the subregion. Belize continues to participate in
some of the efforts of cooperation in the region, especially
vicariously through the development administration of
Belize by the Central American offices of some United
54th plenary meeting
9 November 1995
Nations agencies and through participation in the
“San José Process”, which has now happily resumed for
Belize. We are also enthusiastic participants in the
Alliance for Sustainable Development.
However, regrettably, the documentation sometimes
does not adequately reflect
the fact of our active
involvement. I refer to aspects of document A/50/L.17
and of A/50/499.

We are convinced, however,

Belize will take its rightful place as the bridge between
the isthmus and the wider Caribbean spaces now
epitomized by the Association of Caribbean States. We
suggest that Central America’s economic future and social
upliftment will be enhanced by harnessing the region’s
competitive advantages in the globalization process.
Belize’s stable political order and institutions, and its
official language, are assets in this regard. We pledge to
put them to the full use of the isthmus and of the wider
Caribbean.
