Agenda item 15
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs
(a) Election of five non-permanent members of the
Security Council
The President: This morning the General Assembly
will proceed to the election of five non-permanent members
of the Security Council to replace those members whose
term of office expires on 31 December 1996.
The five non-permanent outgoing members are the
following: Botswana, Germany, Honduras, Indonesia and
Italy. These five States cannot be re-elected and therefore
their names should not appear on the ballot papers.
Apart from the five permanent members, the Security
Council will include in 1997 the following States: Chile,
Egypt, Guinea-Bissau, Poland and the Republic of Korea.
The names of those States, therefore, should also not appear
on the ballot papers.
Of the five non-permanent members which will remain
in office in 1997 three are from Africa and Asia, one is
from Eastern Europe and one is from Latin America and
the Caribbean.
resolution
1991 A (XVIII)
Consequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General
of
Assembly
17 December 1963,
the five non-permanent members
should be elected according to the following pattern: two
from Africa and Asia, one from Latin America and the
Caribbean and two from Western European and other
States. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.
In accordance with established practice, there is an
understanding to the effect that, of the two States to be
elected from Africa and Asia, one should be from Africa
and one from Asia.
I should like to inform the Assembly that
the
number of candidates, not exceeding the number of seats
to be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a
two-thirds majority of those present and voting will be
declared elected.
In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there
will be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates
which have obtained an equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to
that procedure?
It was so decided.

There remain two seats to be filled: one from among
the Latin American and Caribbean States and one from
among the Western European and Other States. We shall
therefore proceed to the first restricted ballot. This second
round of balloting shall be restricted to the two States from
among the Latin American and Caribbean States that were
not elected but that obtained the largest number of votes in
the previous ballot — Bolivia and Costa Rica, bearing in
mind the statement we just heard from the representative of
Bolivia — and to the two States from among the Western
European and other States that were not elected but
obtained the largest number of votes on the previous
ballot — Australia and Portugal. This is in accordance with
rule 94 of the rules of procedure.
Ballot papers marked “B” and “C” will now be
distributed.
May I ask representatives to write on the ballot papers
marked “B”, for the Latin American and Caribbean States,
the name of the one State for which they want to vote, and
to write on the ballot papers marked “C”, for the Western
European and other States, the name of the one State for
which they want to vote. Ballot papers marked “B” will be
declared invalid if they contain the name of a State other
than Bolivia or Costa Rica, and if they contain the name of
more than one State. Ballot papers marked “C” will be
declared invalid if they contain the name of a State other
than Australia or Portugal, and if they contain the name of
more than one State.
