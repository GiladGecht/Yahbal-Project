The 18 outgoing members are: Bulgaria, Chile, Costa

the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and

the Netherlands, Nicaragua,
In accordance with paragraph 4 of General Assembly
resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971, and taking
into account the number of States which will remain
members of the Council after 1 January 1997, the 18
members should be elected as follows: five from African
States,
three from Asian States, one from Eastern
European States, four from Latin American and Caribbean
States, and five from Western European and other States.
The ballot papers reflect this pattern.
I should like to inform the Assembly that
the
number of candidates, not exceeding the number of seats
to be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a
two-thirds majority of those present and voting will be
declared elected. In the case of a tie vote for a remaining
seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to those
candidates which have obtained an equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to
this procedure?
It was so decided.
The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the
rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret
ballot, and there shall be no nominations.
Regarding candidatures, I have been informed that
for the five vacancies from among the African States, the
candidates endorsed by the Group of African States are
Cape Verde, Djibouti,
the Gambia, Mozambique and
Zambia.
