The ballot papers reflect this pattern. Representatives
are requested to place a cross to the left of the names of the
candidates for whom they wish to vote, but for no more

Representatives may vote only for those candidates whose
names appear on the ballot papers.
I should like to inform members that the number of
candidates not exceeding the number of seats to be filled,
receiving the greatest number of votes and not less than the
majority of the votes of the Member States present and

a remaining seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to
those candidates who have obtained an equal number of
votes.

procedure?
It was so decided.
The President: Ballot papers marked A, B, C, D and
E will now be distributed. I request the representatives to
