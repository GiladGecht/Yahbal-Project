The 18 outgoing members are Australia, Belarus,
Brazil, Colombia, the Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, India, Jamaica,

In accordance with paragraph 4 of General Assembly
resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971, and taking
into account the number of States which will remain
members of the Council after 1 January 1998, the 18

States,
two from Eastern
European States,
three from Latin American and
Caribbean States and four from Western European and
other States. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.
from Asian States,
four
I should like to inform the Assembly that
the
number of candidates, not exceeding the number of seats
to be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a
two-thirds majority of those present and voting will be
declared elected. In the case of a tie vote for a remaining
seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to those
candidates which have obtained an equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to
this procedure?
It was so decided.
The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the
rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret
ballot, and there shall be no nominations.
Regarding candidatures, I have been informed by the
Chairmen of the regional groups that, for the five vacant
seats from among the African States, the five endorsed
candidates are Algeria, the Comoros, Lesotho, Mauritius
and Sierra Leone.
