Agenda item 15 (continued)
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs
Under the circumstances, and in order to facilitate
the course of the election, the Georgian delegation has
decided to withdraw its candidature. Once again, let me
thank those who supported us, and extend our best wishes
for success to the delegation of Poland.
(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic and
The President: I call on the representative of Qatar.
Social Council
The President: This afternoon the General Assembly
will continue with the election of 18 members of the
Economic and Social Council to replace those members
whose term of office expires on 31 December 1997.
As members will
recall, when the 40th plenary
meeting was adjourned earlier today there still remained to
be filled two seats from among the Asian States, one seat
from among the Eastern European States and one seat from
among the Latin American and Caribbean States.
I call on the representative of Georgia.
Mr. Volski (Georgia): I take this opportunity to
extend the warmest words of gratitude to those delegations
that advocated Georgia’s membership of the Economic and
Social Council and supported us to the very end. I would
like also to congratulate warmly all those already elected to
that important body, among them the delegation of Belarus
from our regional group.
Mr. Al-Khalifa (Qatar) (interpretation from Arabic):
As members know, Qatar is among the candidates for
membership of the Economic and Social Council. My
country attaches great importance to occupying one of the
seats allocated to the Asian States in order to represent
our region. We recall that all countries large and small
are eligible to stand for seats on the Economic and Social
Council, something we have seen with respect to the
African States and something which deserves the greatest
respect and recognition from my country and its regional
group.
In view of our belief
in the importance of
representation for the Asian group and in view of the fact
that Oman is among the candidates from that group, my
delegation has decided to withdraw its candidature in
favour of that of our sister State of Oman. I thank all
those delegations that have supported our candidature
throughout the process.

Mr. Marzuki (Malaysia): I thank all those who have
supported our candidature in the last three rounds of
voting. Given the fact that there have been three ballots
and in the light of our commitment to the Asian Group
that we would not stand in the way of a clean slate, we
wish to facilitate the proceedings today by withdrawing
our candidature. I wish once again to express our deep
appreciation to all those delegations that supported our
candidature, and to convey our congratulations to those
that have been elected.

In accordance with the rules of procedure we should
proceed next to an unrestricted ballot. However, in the
course of consultations I have just undertaken with the
parties concerned and with the Chairman of the Group of
Latin America and Caribbean States it was agreed to
propose that
the Assembly postpone that unrestricted

announced. May I take it that the Assembly agrees to that
proposal?
It was so decided.
