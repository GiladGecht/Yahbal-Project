resolutions are reflected in the document before the
General Assembly under the relevant headings.
Adoption of the agenda and organization of work: first
report of the General Committee (A/52/250)
We shall now examine section II of the report,
which deals with the organization of the session.
The President: This morning,
the Assembly will
consider the first report of the General Committee, which
has been circulated in document A/52/250. I will refer to
specific sections and paragraphs of the report which contain
recommendations for consideration by the Assembly.
In paragraph 2 of its report, the General Committee
draws the attention of
the General Assembly to the
provisions reproduced in annexes V, VI, VII and VIII to its
rules of procedure.
May I take it that the Assembly takes note of those
provisions? I see no objection.
It was so decided.
We turn first to section II.B, which deals with the
rationalization of work of the General Assembly. In
paragraph 6, the General Committee draws the attention
of the General Assembly to paragraph 5 of the annex to
resolution 45/45,
regarding certain Main Committees
meeting in sequential order, and to paragraph 23 of
annex I of resolution 50/227, concerning the discussions
in the Second and Third Committees, which, to the extent
feasible, should not commence until after the end of the
general debate in the plenary meetings of the General
Assembly.
May I take it that the General Assembly takes note
of paragraph 6? I see no objection.
It was so decided.
The President:
In paragraph 3,
the General
Committee took note of General Assembly resolution
48/264 of 29 July 1994, entitled “Revitalization of the work
of the General Assembly”, and of annex I thereto, entitled
“Guidelines on the rationalization of the agenda of the
General Assembly”. The General Committee also took note

The President:
In paragraph 12,
the General
Committee recommends that, in order to avoid the late
start of meetings, the General Assembly should waive the
requirement of the presence of at least one third of the
members to declare a plenary meeting open and permit
the debate to proceed, and of at least one quarter of the
members to declare a meeting of a Main Committee open
and permit the debate to proceed.
The President:

General Assembly that morning meetings should start at
10 a.m. promptly for all plenary meetings and meetings of
the Main Committees.
The President: For that matter, I should like to
endorse strongly the practical suggestions that were made
at previous sessions, for each delegation to designate
someone to be present at the scheduled time. I genuinely
hope that all delegations will cooperate.

General Assembly
Fifty-second session
In section II.E, concerning the general debate, the
General Committee recommends that the general debate
begin on Monday, 22 September, and end by Friday, 10
October 1997. The General Committee also recommends
that the list of speakers in the general debate be closed on
Wednesday, 24 September, at 6 p.m.
May I consider that the General Assembly approves
the recommendations contained in paragraph 14?
It was so decided.
The President: In view of the very large number of
speakers already inscribed, I urge representatives to speak
in the general debate in the order in which they appear on
the list of speakers. Those who are unable to speak at the
scheduled time will be put at the end of the list for that
meeting.

takes note of the provisions regarding the length of
statements contained in paragraph 18?

meetings.
In paragraph 19, the General Committee took note
of the fact
that verbatim records would be provided
during the fifty-second session for the plenary meetings
of the General Assembly and meetings of the First
Committee, and that summary records would be provided
for the meetings of the General Committee and the other
Main Committees of the Assembly.

their statements, speakers in the general debate should leave

is located behind the podium, before returning to their

The President: Section II.I concerns resolutions.

the provisions contained in paragraphs 21 to 25?

subsidiary organs contained in paragraph 26?
It was so decided.
The President:
In paragraph 27,
the attention of
the General
Committee also draws
the General
Assembly to paragraph 6 of its resolution 48/264 and to
paragraph 4 of its resolution 50/206 C, which emphasize
that documentation should be available in accordance with
the six-week rule for
the distribution of documents
simultaneously in each of the six official languages of the
United Nations.
May I
take it
that
the Assembly takes note of
paragraph 27?
It was so decided.
The President:
In paragraph 28,
the General
Committee took note of the fact that, as announced earlier,
a target has been set
for an early reduction in the
documentation produced by the Secretariat and that the
volume of pre-session documentation for the fifty-second
session is projected at a level slightly below that of
previous comparable years.
In this connection, I urge members of the Assembly to
make a special effort during this session,
taking into
consideration especially the provisions of resolution 51/241
on the strengthening of the United Nations system,
to
exercise restraint
in making proposals requesting new
reports of the Secretary-General and to consider integrating,
biennializing or triennializing the presentation of reports.

The President: In paragraph 31, which concerns
sub-paragraph 13 (d) of decision 34/401, the General
Committee draws
the Assembly’s attention to the
observations by the Secretary-General that the preparation
of a statement of programme budget implications by the
Secretary-General may take a few days. In addition, the
Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary
Questions and the Fifth Committee need adequate time to
review the programme budget implications of a draft
resolution before the draft resolution can be acted on by
the Assembly.

The President: Section II.L concerns observances
and commemorative meetings. We turn first to paragraph
32. The General Committee recommends that, allowing
for the necessary flexibility and with the exception of the
anniversary of the United Nations, the General Assembly
should adopt the suggested format for commemorative
meetings, including limiting each statement to 15 minutes.
May I take it

the Assembly approves the
recommendations contained in paragraph 32?

General Assembly
Fifty-second session
The President: In section II.N, concerning meetings
of subsidiary organs, the General Committee recommends
to the General Assembly, on the strict understanding that
meetings would have to be accommodated within available
facilities and services, that the subsidiary organs referred to
in paragraph 36 be authorized to meet during the main part
of the fifty-second session.
May I take it that the General Assembly approves that
recommendation?
It was so decided.
The President: We turn now to section III, which
contains observations on the organization of future sessions
of the General Assembly. In paragraph 38, the General
Committee draws the attention of the General Assembly to
resolution 51/241, entitled “Strengthening of the United
Nations system”, adopted by the General Assembly on 31
July 1997 and to be implemented as of 1 January 1998. The
attention of the General Assembly is drawn especially to
section VI of the annex to the resolution, concerning the
timing of the plenary meetings of the General Assembly.
May I take it that the General Assembly takes note of
paragraph 38?
It was so decided.
The President: We turn now to section IV of the
report of the General Committee, relating to the adoption of
the agenda. This section starts with paragraph 39.
I would first recall rule 23 of the rules of procedure,
which provides that:
“Debate on the inclusion of an item in the
agenda, when that item has been recommended for
inclusion by the General Committee, shall be limited
to three speakers in favour of, and three against, the
inclusion.”
I should like to stress that at this time we are not
discussing the substance of any item.
With regard to paragraph 40, may I consider that it is
the wish of the Assembly to direct its Main Committees to
review their agendas with a view to streamlining their
programmes of work, as suggested in that paragraph?

not to include an item in the agenda.

Mr. Rosenstock (United States of America): We
wish to associate ourselves with your comments,
Mr. President, concerning the treatment of item 62, which
has, of course, been referred to plenary meeting for future
consideration. That was a decision taken by the General
Assembly at this session.

The President: We shall now turn to paragraph 51 of

of France.
Mr. Legal (France) (interpretation from French):
My comments are not related to the issue raised by the
two previous speakers, but to the fact that, with regard to
paragraph 51 of the version of the text from which I am
working,
the text distributed to us is incomplete. It
contains the allocation of items for plenary meetings, First
Committee and Fourth Committee, but it does not contain
the text of the allocation of items to the Second, Third,
Fifth or Sixth Committees.
Mr. Kamal (Pakistan): It is our understanding that, in
allocating item 62 to the plenary, we are in no way
prejudging the mechanism to be set up subsequently for the
proper and detailed consideration of the issue. This can be
either the plenary itself, a committee of the whole, a
working group or the relevant Main Committees. It is also
our understanding that the plenary itself will decide on the
issue of the mechanism after the general debate.
In principle, in such a case as this my delegation
would not be in a position to associate itself with the
adoption of the recommendations proposed to us in the
report of the General Committee. We are therefore in a
difficult position. However, the Secretariat has apologized
to us and has indicated that the corrected version of the
text — at least, the French version — will be given to us
without delay.
The President: I would like to take this opportunity
to inform the General Assembly that the President is now
undertaking very extensive consultations, since this issue
was raised in the meeting of the General Committee, to
determine the mechanism of the consideration of the
Secretary-General’s report on reform of the United Nations.
Certainly, the Assembly in plenary meeting will make a
decision on the format of the mechanism on this issue.
I now invite members to turn to the list of items
recommended by the General Committee for consideration
in plenary meeting.
Taking into account the decisions just adopted, may I
consider that the General Assembly approves the allocation
of the items listed in paragraph 51 of the report of the
General Committee for consideration directly in plenary
meeting?

Having expressed my reservations, and given the
assurances provided to us, I do not want
to create
problems for the adoption of the recommendations in
paragraph 51 in this exceptional case. I understand that
the staff of the Secretariat make a great effort, working
carefully and to the best of their abilities to provide us
with good documentation, so I do not want to complicate
is
their lives. However, I believe that
revealing of
the General
Assembly and of the documentation and language services
are working under excessive pressure. This type of
incident shows that there are limits to the pressure that
one can impose on staff. I believe that our friends in the
Secretariat are working hard; perhaps they are working
too hard, and this is the result of such overwork.

this pass. But I trust that the definitive corrected version
will be given to us as soon as possible. We have been
given the text in English, but of course the English text
cannot suffice.
The President: Let us now turn to the allocation of
agenda items to the Main Committees. We come first to
the list of items which the General Committee has
recommended for allocation to the First Committee.
I

should like
The President:
the
representative of France that
the Secretariat and the
presidency will undertake all necessary measures to have all
documents issued in all
languages of the
Organization promptly and on time. As the Assembly is
well aware,
this bulky document was approved only
yesterday by the General Committee, and I convened the
plenary meeting at 11 o’clock instead of at 10 o’clock, as
originally scheduled,
to provide an opportunity for the
documentation and other services of the Secretariat to issue
all the documents. However, that has not been the case. I
can assure delegations that the Secretariat and I will do our
best to have documents issued on time. I am grateful to the
distinguished representative of France for his cooperation
and understanding of the situation.
I now give the floor
to the representative of
Swaziland.
Mr. Dlamini (Swaziland): I wish to echo the spirit of
understanding that you, Mr. President, expressed towards
the delegation of France, which has received by mistake a
document that is not in its language, one of the official
languages of the United Nations. I am sure that in the near
future the United Nations will have to reconsider the
question of languages very carefully, especially given the
fact that now there are so many Members of this body
whose languages are not regarded as languages because
they are not among the six that are used. I, for instance,
would like to speak my language, siSwati, here, in order to
express myself better in debates. However, we appreciate
the understanding offered to the delegation of France.
In addition, I wish to make the observation that a
document of this significance should in future be made
ready before we come here to adopt the recommendations
in the report. In my view, this would allow delegations to
peruse the document, see the mistakes and inadvertent
omissions and also, perhaps, see where we could make the
necessary changes so that the document could be adopted
