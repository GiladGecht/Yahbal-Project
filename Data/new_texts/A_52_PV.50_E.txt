The President: Before turning to the items on the
agenda for this morning, I should like to remind the
General Assembly that
the eighth Africa
Industrialization Day.
today is
Since its proclamation by the General Assembly eight
years ago, Africa Industrialization Day has been celebrated
on 20 November. Today, it gives me great pleasure to join
in the commemoration of this event.
What are we celebrating on Africa Industrialization
Day? First, we are celebrating the valiant efforts of the
peoples of Africa to achieve a better life for themselves
through industrial development. Secondly, the celebration
of this event serves as an important reminder of the need to
draw world attention to the industrial development of
Africa. Thirdly, Africa Industrialization Day symbolizes the
solidarity of the international community with the countries
in Africa. Above all,
the principle of
partnership and shared responsibility between Africa and
the international community in the industrial development
of the continent.

Collectively,
they underscore the commitment of the
international community to Africa's development. An
integral part of this commitment is the promotion and
acceleration of Africa's industrial development. Based on
the experience of the rich industrialized and the newly
industrializing countries, there is increased recognition
that industrialization holds the key to the transformation
of Africa from poverty to prosperity.
The continuing decline of
the industrial sector
despite growing signs of economic recovery in many
African countries has therefore been a cause for serious
concern. As a consequence of the poor performance of
the industrial sector, the share of sub-Saharan Africa in
global manufacturing production has dropped from 0.6
per cent in 1970 to 0.3 per cent in 1995. The share of
manufactured products in total African exports has barely
changed over the last two decades and is still below 10
per cent. Moreover, four-fifths of sub-Saharan Africa's
industrial production is classified as low-technology.
This disturbing trend has contributed to the widening
industrialization and technological gap between Africa
and the rest of the world. It has raised considerable
concern about the ability of African industry to compete
in a highly competitive global economic environment.
Africa's leaders recognized the need to take collective and

effective action to address this crucial challenge. In June of
this year, the Assembly of African Heads of State and
Government of the Organization of African Unity decided
in their Harare Declaration on African Industrialization to
redouble their efforts to promote sustainable industrial
development through private-sector-led strategies and new
global partnerships. They endorsed the launching of the
Alliance for Africa's Industrialization, supported by the
United Nations
Industrial Development Organization
(UNIDO), as the principal mechanism for promoting
private-public sector partnerships within Africa as well as
partnerships between African and non-African enterprises.
Given the prominence of the private sector in Africa's
industrialization strategy, it is appropriate that the theme of
this year's celebration of Africa Industrialization Day is
“Development of Small and Medium Industries”. The
majority of industrial enterprises in Africa are small and
medium-sized, but they account for a large share of jobs
created in the economy.
Many are individual or
family-owned business
operations with great potential for adjusting rapidly to
changing market conditions. With trade liberalization and
deregulation, their role has increased in importance. They
are increasingly becoming a dynamic force for
the
promotion of sustainable industrial development in Africa.
the efforts of African countries
While the United Nations system has done much to
support
to achieve
sustainable development, much more needs to be done.
Organizations of the United Nations system need to work
more closely together to encourage the growth of small and
medium-sized enterprises in African countries. They need
to intensify their efforts to help small African entrepreneurs
gain access to markets, investments, credit, technology and
training. In this connection, the contribution that the United
Nations Industrial Development Organization has made over
the years in facilitating enterprise-level cooperation between
African and non-African business partners and in providing
a range of technical support services to small enterprises,
particularly those of women entrepreneurs, has been
commendable.
The development activities of United Nations agencies
in support of industrial development in Africa should be
better harmonized. Resources available throughout
the
United Nations system for this purpose should be pooled to
maximize the impact of the system's contributions to
Africa's development. An important step in this direction is
the incorporation of the industrial development objectives
of African countries in the formulation of country strategy

notes and in the United Nations Development Assistance
Framework.
As we celebrate Africa Industrialization Day, we
remind ourselves of the importance of taking a common
approach to our common challenges. The development of
Africa is our common challenge, requiring concerted and
coordinated action on the part of
the international
community. Today's event provides a good opportunity to
reaffirm our commitment to international cooperation and
our steadfast support to Africa as it strives to fulfil its
hopes and aspirations for a better future.
I call now on the Secretary-General.
The Secretary-General: We gather on Africa
Industrialization Day to raise public awareness and
harness international support — political, technical and
financial — for Africa's industrial development. Industrial

With industrial development, the continent can take
decisive steps towards full-throttle competition in the
globalized marketplace. But without it, as African leaders
themselves declared last
June in Harare, African
economies will be condemned to persistent crisis,
dependence on humanitarian relief and deepening poverty,
despair and political unrest.
(spoke in French)
As we mark this eighth Africa Industrialization Day,
hope is the watchword for much of the African continent.
In 1996, for the first time in 20 years, Africa experienced
growth exceeding 4 per cent. More and more countries
are experiencing remarkable economic expansion. The
private sector is beginning to play its role in powering the
economy. Everywhere, civil society is creating the
institutions it needs in order to be heard. Decision-makers
are vigorously pursuing their programmes of political,
economic and social reform. Good governance and its
foundations — political legitimacy, a State based on the
rule of law, and transparency in administration — are
now the goals.
Notwithstanding what has been achieved, the results

infrastructure; weak institutions; poorly adapted regulations
and systems for stimulating the financial sphere; and the
widening technological gap between developed and
developed countries:
these are obstacles that slow the
industrialization of Africa. The continent therefore does not
benefit as much as it could from the globalization and
liberalization of trade, and it remains difficult for African
countries to become fully integrated into the world
economy.
(spoke in English)
This year's Africa Industrialization Day focuses on the
development of small- and medium-scale industries. Such
enterprises are the backbone of economic activity in Africa.
They are a major source of livelihoods and income. In both
the formal and the informal sectors, small entrepreneurs

skills of their workers, to improve the quality of their
products, to find sources of financing and to gain market
access. They need technology and the requisite physical
infrastructure. They need partners: partners from within and
beyond the region.
In this light, I welcome recent initiatives by Africa's
development partners to promote trade and investment with
African countries. The outcome of last month's high-level
meeting on the least-developed countries, sponsored by the
World Trade Organization, the United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development and the International Trade
Centre,
is very encouraging. With 33 out of 48 least-
developed countries, Africa stands to benefit greatly from
the integrated framework adopted in Geneva, especially the
market access facilities that have been announced.
The Alliance for Africa's Industrialization, launched
last year, is another important undertaking, in particular
with respect to its focus on partnerships with the private
sector.
The United Nations system — through the United
Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the
United Nations Development Programme, the Economic
Commission for Africa and other bodies — will continue to
support such ventures. UNIDO, as the only specialized

forward, Africa's leaders must rise to the occasion. Their

vital importance. Only then will African industry take off.
Only then will Africa find the path to sustained

Note by the Secretary-General (A/52/110)
It was so decided.
The President: In connection with sub-item (j) of
agenda item 17, a note by the Secretary-General has been
circulated in document A/52/110.
As indicated in that document, the General Assembly
is required, during the fifty-second session, to appoint a
member to fill the vacancy in the Joint Inspection Unit that
will arise from the expiration of the term of office on 31
December 1998 of Mr. Raul Quijano of Argentina.
As also indicated in that document, in accordance with
article 3, paragraph 1, of the statute of the Joint Inspection
Unit, the President of the General Assembly shall consult
with Member States to draw up a list of countries — in this
case, one country — which would be requested to propose
a candidate for appointment to the Joint Inspection Unit.
After holding the necessary consultations, I should like
to communicate to the Assembly the following information
received from the Chairman of
the Group of Latin
American and Caribbean States: two countries — namely,
Argentina and Colombia — have decided to present their
candidatures for one vacancy from among the Latin
American and Caribbean States.
I should like, in accordance with past practice, to
consult with Member States through the procedure of
holding an advisory vote by secret ballot to select from
among the Latin American and Caribbean States one
country, which would be requested to propose a candidate
for appointment to the Joint Inspection Unit.
Although this advisory vote would not be an election,
we would follow the rules of procedure of the Assembly
governing elections.

The President: In accordance with rule 93 of the
rules of procedure of the General Assembly, when only
one person or member is to be elected and no candidate
obtains in the first ballot the majority required, a second
ballot shall be taken, which shall be restricted to the two
candidates obtaining the largest number of votes. If in the
second ballot the votes are equally divided, and a majority
is required,
the President shall decide between the
candidates by drawing lots.
I take it
that
the Assembly also agrees to that
procedure.
It was so decided.
The President: Before I request the Secretariat to
distribute the ballot papers, I should like to remind
members of the Assembly that we are now going to
proceed to the selection of one country from among the
Latin American and Caribbean States, which will be
requested to propose a candidate to fill the vacancy in the
Joint Inspection Unit. The Assembly is not — I repeat,
not — appointing a member to the Joint Inspection Unit
at this time. It is only selecting one country which will be
requested to propose a candidate. Therefore, only the
name of a country and not the name of an individual
should appear on the ballot paper.

sponsors listed in the draft resolution, as well as the new
sponsors of this draft resolution:
the Central African
Republic, Chile, Jamaica, South Africa and Swaziland.
In this draft resolution, we propose some elements
regarding a culture of peace. The basic thrust of the draft
resolution is to have at the next session a draft declaration
and programme of action on a culture of peace, and we
are requesting the Secretary-General to submit one.
This draft is the outcome of intensive consultations
with all interested delegations. In order to accommodate
the concerns of other delegations, we have made
amendments to the original draft contained in A/52/L.4,
and those have been incorporated into this new text.
I will briefly mention those changes, but before that
let me say that we, the sponsors, very strongly believe
that the subject of a culture of peace is an important one
that covers a broad area and deserves our attention at the
highest level. With that in mind, we requested that this
item be considered in plenary under a new and separate
agenda item, and we hope that this will continue to be the
case in coming sessions of the General Assembly as well.
This subject has attained a level of attention,
importance and comprehensiveness that it is appropriate
that it be dealt with by the apex body of the United
Nations system, the General Assembly. We believe that

to the Director-General our ideas regarding his draft

The European Union has nevertheless decided to join

Ms. Saiga (Japan): The promotion of a culture of
peace is an important task for the Member States of the
United Nations if our common quest
for peaceful
coexistence is to succeed. It is only in a culture of peace
which is rooted in social interaction and sharing, tolerance
and respect for human rights, and a determination to lay
and then maintain the foundation of democracy and
freedom that it is possible to actualize the purposes and
principles of the United Nations, and thus save future
generations from living in terror and fear of violence. It
is for this reason that my delegation joined in the
consensus on draft resolution A/52/L.4/Rev.1.
When the General Assembly requests a report to be
submitted, it expects that that report will genuinely reflect
the views of the Secretary-General or of the organization
to which the Secretary-General has assigned the task of
preparing it. Much to our disappointment, this is not the
case with the report of the Director-General of the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) in document A/52/292. That report, which

a special fund, was submitted to the Secretary-General
without any prior consultation with the Executive Board of
UNESCO. That failure to follow proper procedure was
brought to the attention of the members of the Executive
Board at its meeting last October.
My delegation would have liked a genuine discussion
to have taken place within UNESCO before the report was
submitted to the General Assembly so that it could benefit
from the views of member States and, consequently, be
received as a credible basis for future discussion. As this is

My delegation is concerned that the draft declaration

that when the Secretary-General implements this year's
resolution,
in cooperation with the Director-General of
UNESCO, the views of the States members of UNESCO
will be properly reflected.

Agenda item 28
Universal Congress on the Panama Canal
Report of the Secretary-General (A/52/435 and
Corr.1)
Mr. Boyd (Panama) (interpretation from Spanish):
The President of the Republic of Panama, Mr. Ernesto
Pérez Balladares,
invited the entities using the Canal,
private-sector shipping concerns and the Governments
interested in the use of the Canal
to contribute ideas
regarding the future of the Panama Canal at a gathering
called the Universal Congress on the Panama Canal, which
was held at Panama City from 7 to 10 September 1997.
50th plenary meeting
20 November 1997
President Pérez Balladares said
“The purpose of the gathering was to gain a clear
vision of what the waterway would be like following
its transfer to Panama. The Canal users, accordingly,
had an opportunity at that forum to provide input
and to discuss what kind of waterway would best
serve their interests in the coming decades. There
can be no doubt that the transfer of the Panama
Canal will stimulate a surge of entrepreneurial
activity that will create new opportunities with the
development of industrial zones, the tourist industry
and the opening up of the real estate market along
the Canal, in what used to be known as the Canal
Zone.”
In 1914 the gates to the Panama Canal were opened
wide to the world. The Canal is 80 kilometres long, from
the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans, and was dug through
the narrowest and lowest stretch of the mountainous
isthmus that links North and South America. Its principal
features are its two terminal ports, its three sets of twin
locks, Gatún Lake and the Gaillard Cut, also known as
the Culebra Cut.
The locks enable transiting vessels to go up and
come down again. The Panama Canal is a fresh-water
canal. In the Gatún Locks, vessels bound for the Pacific
are lifted to the level of Gatún Lake, a height of 85 feet,
while Atlantic-bound vessels are lowered to sea level. In
Gamboa, the Panama Canal's route leaves the natural
course of the Chagres River and enters the Gaillard Cut.
The Gaillard Cut is man-made. It was excavated, dredged
and blasted through the mountain range known as the
Continental Cordillera. In its day, the digging of the Cut
was the largest earth-moving projet ever attempted. Its
extension reached 9 miles at its highest point, more than
320 feet above sea level. There are three levels of
contiguous locks at Gatún. Ships able to traverse the
Panama Canal locks can be up to 100 feet wide and 950
feet long. The locks are composed of pairs of imposing
gates from 47 to 82 feet in height.
The Miraflores Locks mark the Pacific terminus of
the Panama Canal. The two twin chambers of Miraflores
Lake lead to the port of Balboa at sea level. Miraflores
Lake, at an altitude of 54 feet, was created by damming
the waters of the Rio Grande and Rio Cocolí.
Again, the Canal is a fresh-water canal. Every transit
of any vessel through the Panama Canal creates a loss of
52 million gallons of water, which flow into the oceans.
7
General Assembly
Fifty-second session
Fortunately, more than 95 per cent of the merchant vessels
now in service are in line with the Canal's parameters.
Panama's merchant marine ranks first in the world,
and we are now planning a national maritime commission
to bring together under a single body all the elements
required by the new measures.
At this important Congress, the participants included
representatives of chambers of commerce, export-import
associations, port administrators, shipping agents, banks,
insurance companies and all kinds of governmental agencies
that deal with the transport aspects of
foreign trade
activities, as well as academic bodies. There were 65
speakers, while 345 representatives of the information
media from 19 countries, as well as some 571 staff from
the local media, covered the event.
Panama is very appreciative of the support given by
Ambassador Edgar Camacho Omiste of Bolivia and
Ambassador Pierre Lelong of Haiti to the initial idea of
holding a Universal Congress on the Panama Canal. On 7
November 1995 and 24 October 1996, respectively, they
spoke in favour of this idea on behalf of the Latin
American and Caribbean Group. Similarly, here at
the
United Nations, we wish to acknowledge the support
provided by Ambassador Victor Marrero of the United
States, Mr. Jean-Michel Gaussot of France, Ambassador
Fernando Enrique Petrella of Argentina and Mr. Emilio
Izquierdo of Ecuador.
Both the European Union and the Government of
Taiwan made substantial contributions to this meeting,
taking into account the importance of the Canal for many
countries, in particular those of South and Central America.
For the historical record, document A/52/347 contains
the Declarations of the Eleventh Summit of the Heads of
State or Government of the Rio Group, which was held in
Asunción, Paraguay, on 23 and 24 August 1997. Paragraph
25 of that document states,
“We reaffirm the importance of the Universal
Congress on the Panama Canal, to be held from 7 to
10 September 1997 as a forum open to the entire
international community; this meeting should serve as
a consultation mechanism for specifically examining
the role which the Canal should play in the twenty-
first century and the plans for expanding its services
which the Government of Panama is promoting
through the Board of Directors of the Panama Canal
Authority. We also express our belief that the results

In the course of the meeting, Mr. Jorge E. Ritter,
Minister for Canal Affairs, explained the transfer of
jurisdiction over the management of the Canal. The laws
and regulations of the United States that govern the Canal
until 31 December 1999 will be replaced by Panamanian
laws and regulations that have formed part of our
country's Political Constitution since 1994. Those laws
and regulations guarantee the type of agency that will be
taking over from the United States. It will include an
autonomous administrative and financial commission, and
conditions for Canal workers will not be affected. The
budget for this agency will be separate from the national
budget, and the agency will guarantee that traffic in the
Canal will not be interrupted for any reason.
Mr. Ritter also explained that the Treaty concerning
the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama
Canal envisages that tolls and tariffs for passage will be

fair, reasonable, equitable and in line with the principles of
international law. This ensures that there will never be

reaffirmed by our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ricardo
Alberto Arias.
talking about
The Secretary-General of
the Organization of
American States, Mr. César Gaviria,
the
transition and the domestic growth produced by the use of
the Canal, said that some impressive figures were being
achieved. He announced that trade between Latin America
and the Caribbean had grown by 20 per cent and that trade
between Latin America and the United States had grown by
12 per cent. He added that the volume of trade by Latin
America was increasing by 12 per cent per year.
The Congress bore ample witness to the fact that the
seafaring world recognizes the stability of the Panama
Canal and that international maritime organizations are
confident they can depend on the security of the Canal.
Mr. Alberto Alemán Zubieta, Administrator of the
Panama Canal Commission, stressed the Canal's neutrality
as one of its fundamental aspects, along with other aspects
such as its competitiveness,
the need to pursue an
appropriate financial policy and the modernization of the
Canal's locks using new technology and equipment. As to
the possibility of building a third set of locks in 2010, the
Administrator said that
“for a decision of this magnitude we will have to
carry out an appropriate engineering study”.
In years past a tripartite commission, made up of
the United States and Panama, had already

The gathering held in Panama studied major issues,
such as the importance of the Canal; the Canal's capacity
for meeting future requirements; alternative approaches to
resolving problems of size and capability; the project for

the Canal's competitiveness;
alternative routes for the Canal; the need to keep the tolls
and service charges as low as possible; the effects of toll

a way of reducing costs and increasing efficiency; operating
the Canal in accordance with sound business principles;
avoiding domestic political interference in order to maintain

There was consensus among the participants that
Panama does have the human and technical capital to
manage, operate and efficiently maintain the Canal after
it reverts to the country in 1999. According to official
statistics, 82 per cent of the 8,500 workers on the
waterway are Panamanians. Of 324 management
positions, 148 are held by Panamanians in the operational
units and the naval, engineering and construction front
offices.
The Congress provided a superb and unique
opportunity for representatives of the merchant marine
industry and collateral
fields to describe to future
interested parties how the Panama Canal works and thus
give them a complete understanding of what lies ahead
for the Canal. The Government of the Republic of
Panama is in earnest in declaring its desire to remain a
key player in the world maritime industry beyond the year
2000.
In Panama's view, the Congress came to a close
having attained its chief objective of demonstrating to the
international community that the Republic of Panama is
prepared to assume control of the Panama Canal, as
stipulated in the treaties signed between the United States
of America and Panama on 7 September 1977. These
were coined the Torrijos-Carter treaties by my illustrious
predecessor, Mr. Jorge E. Illueca, and by Mr. Fernando
Manfredo, High Commissioner of the Republic of Panama
to the Universal Congress on the Panama Canal, who
worked long and hard to bring the task to a happy
culmination.
Panamanian leaders have always believed that the
Panama Canal is destined to provide an international,
neutral and non-discriminatory public service and that,
accordingly, its uninterrupted and efficient operation is of
special
to such organizations as the United
Nations. That is the main reason behind our introduction
of this brief report.

General Assembly
Fifty-second session
The Acting President: May I take it that it is the
wish of the General Assembly to conclude its consideration
of agenda item 28?
It was so decided.
Agenda item 32
Zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic
Report of the Secretary-General (A/52/462)
Draft resolution (A/52/L.24/Rev.1)
The Acting President:
to the
representative of South Africa to introduce draft resolution
A/52/L.24/Rev.1.
I give the floor
Mr. Bergh (South Africa): It is indeed an honour for
South Africa to introduce the draft resolution entitled “Zone
of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic”, contained
in document A/52/L.24, on behalf of States members of the
zone. The draft is the result of intensive consultations held
with States Members of the United Nations.
The objectives of the zone include the enhancement of
peace and security; the promotion of regional cooperation
for social and economic development; the promotion of
environmental conservation; and the sustained management
of natural resources, and are being actively pursued by
every member State.
Apart from peace, security and the mutual protection
of the environment, each member State has definitive
further benefits to be derived from its association with the
region. These include the promotion of
intraregional
tourism, communication,
technology and information
exchange, and of shipping and other transport links.
I wish to cite one positive example in this respect. A
resolution on the zone of peace and cooperation in the
South Atlantic — submitted by South Africa as Chair of
the zone and cosponsored by all zone States with
Permanent Missions in Vienna — was adopted at
the
fortieth session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs,
which was held in March 1997 in Vienna. The resolution
calls for the United Nations International Drug Control
Programme to examine forms of assistance which could be
extended to the States members of the zone and for the
Executive Director of the United Nations International Drug
Control Programme

One of the zone's principle objectives is to promote
and encourage democratic principles, good governance
and the rule of law and to defend all human rights and
fundamental freedoms. The region has made several
contributions towards peace and security within its

peace and security in the region will forever remain one

For example, the members of the zone have been
involved, both in a bilateral as well as a multilateral
context, in attempts to achieve a positive outcome to the
implementation of the Lusaka Protocol. On a regular
basis, the zone has reaffirmed its willingness to contribute
towards achieving lasting peace in Angola. Circumstances
in Sierra Leone and Liberia have also demanded the
attention of zone member States, and the situation in each
of them has been under constant scrutiny.
The zone has readily accepted the challenges posed
by the new global agenda. The region's constant focus on
democracy, good governance, peace, security and nuclear
disarmament; its undertaking to take responsibility for the
proper and responsible management of the environment;
the protection of fish and other marine resources; cultural
and technology exchanges; and economic cooperation and
respect for human rights all stand to prove that the zone

Another challenge for the countries of the zone lies
in the multilateral arena. This is to develop more coherent
strategies to engage issues of mutual importance through
a process of dialogue. The zone offers a unique
possibility to create such instruments for dialogue and
exchange of expertise, both on a bilateral and on a
multilateral level.
The South African Mission wishes to express its
gratitude to States members of the various regional groups
for their suggestions in drafting this draft resolution,
which in its amended form should once again provide us
with the necessary consensus text. We therefore urge all
Member States to support the draft resolution, so that it
may be adopted without a vote.

(Argentina)
Ms. Ramírez
(interpretation
from
Spanish): It is with satisfaction that I am speaking today on
agenda item 32, entitled “Zone of peace and cooperation of
the South Atlantic”, to support an initiative which opens up
interesting prospects for us in the area of international
cooperation.
I would likewise like to express the appreciation of the
Government of Argentina to South Africa for its important
contributions to and quite outstanding coordination of the
work of the zone during 1996 and 1997.
Eleven years have already gone by since the General
Assembly adopted resolution 41/11 in 1986, in which it
solemnly declared the region of the Atlantic Ocean, in the
region between Africa and South America, the “Zone of
peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic”. The zone was
born as an area for promoting understanding and improving
cooperation among the countries of the South Atlantic.
As
stated in the Brasilia and Somerset West
Declarations, my country attaches particular significance to
fundamental concepts such as democracy and political
pluralism and respect for and defence of human rights and
individual freedoms. We believe that these concepts are
basic elements which form the basis of the purposes and
principles of this initiative.
My delegation is pleased to note that we have made
steady progress towards the objectives which brought about
the creation of the zone. Its member States have already
held four high-level meetings, during which they examined
the various fields open to cooperation during this initial
stage and adopted decisions and declarations with a vision
of the future.
The member States have set
themselves clear
objectives in fundamental areas: the strengthening of peace
and security; the promotion of regional cooperation in the
area of economic and social development; the protection of
the marine environment; and the conservation of resources.

context of
Another issue which my delegation wishes to draw
to the General Assembly's attention has to do with the
transport of irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium and high-
level radioactive wastes. In this regard, I would like to
place on record the concern felt by the Republic of
Argentina — which is surely shared by the other
countries of the zone — at the risks inherent in the
passage of ships carrying radioactive wastes through the
South Atlantic.
Likewise, we favour the adoption in the waters
subject to our jurisdiction of measures recognized by
international law aimed at safeguarding the health of our
populations and marine systems. We believe in the need
to strengthen international regulation in this area.
With regard to the fight against drug trafficking and
the crimes associated with it, we reiterate our constant
readiness to cooperate in achieving the goals of the South
Atlantic zone, in line with the Somerset West Declaration.
As hosts of the fifth high-level meeting, to be held next
year, we trust that we will be able to make progress in
the consideration of some of
the issues related to
cooperation on drugs that will have concrete effects in the
context of the zone.
I would like once again to reaffirm that the Republic
of Argentina shares in the call made annually to all States
by the members of the zone of peace and cooperation of
the South Atlantic to cooperate in promoting its objectives
and to refrain from any action inconsistent with those
objectives, particularly action which may create or
aggravate situations of tension and potential conflict in
the region. The Republic of Argentina extends that call so
that — in accordance with the purposes and principles of
the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant
resolutions of the Organization — all States not only
prevent conflicts but also commit
themselves to the

came to an end with the holding of presidential and
legislative elections on 19 July 1997.
The zone of peace and cooperation of the South
Atlantic is an arena where its members have found the
opportunity to express their solidarity and determination to
cooperate on the basis of essential universal principles, such
as the promotion of democracy and political pluralism and
the advancement of human rights and fundamental liberties,
in the conviction that this will bring us closer to the ideals
which bind the international community. In this setting, we
likewise trust that economic and commercial ties across our
common ocean will be significantly expanded in these
favourable circumstances.
Finally, I would like to reiterate our satisfaction and
commitment as we prepare to serve as host to the fifth
high-level meeting of the zone of peace and cooperation of
the South Atlantic in 1998, an event which we hope will
lead to the advancement of the principles and objectives
which prompted us to establish the zone.
Mr. Amehou (Benin) (interpretation from French): In
establishing the zone of peace and cooperation of the South
Atlantic by resolution 41/11 of 27 October 1986,
the
General Assembly had among its objectives the promotion
of peace and security in the zone and the strengthening of
development cooperation between the countries of Africa
and South America.
The member countries of the zone have worked
towards the progressive achievement of these objectives for
more than 10 years through their successive meetings in
Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) in 1986, in Abuja (Nigeria) in 1990,
in Brasilia (Brazil) in 1994 and in Somerset West (South
Africa) last year. The course thus charted demonstrates the
determination of the countries of the zone to make it a
genuine instrument for the promotion of peace and a
dynamic institution of South-South cooperation.
Benin therefore welcomes the progress achieved,
especially the objectives attained since the holding of the
fourth meeting of member States of the zone in Somerset
West in April 1996.
In this connection, the positive developments in the
situation in Liberia are a source of satisfaction for the
delegation of Benin. Indeed, thanks to the determined action
undertaken by the countries of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) with the support of the
international community, the very long and devastating war
in Liberia — a country which is a member of the zone —
12
Our hope is that, with the support of the countries of
the zone and the United Nations, the current efforts to
restore peace — particularly in Sierra Leone — will
succeed as soon as possible.
In this connection, Benin commends the full support
that
the Security Council has given to ECOWAS to
resolve the crisis in Sierra Leone and restore the
democratically elected Government. The Government of
Benin invites all parties concerned to work towards the
effective and speedy implementation of the peace plan
agreed to at Conakry on 23 October 1997.
The maintenance of peace and stability in the South
Atlantic calls for the promotion of disarmament and the
strengthening of the non-proliferation regime for small
arms and weapons of mass destruction throughout the
zone. To this end,
the denuclearization of the South
Atlantic must remain a priority objective for the countries
of the zone. In that connection, we must work together to
strengthen measures for a complete ban on nuclear
weapons in the South Atlantic through the implementation
of the Treaty of Tlatelolco for the Prohibition of Nuclear
Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean and of the
Treaty of Pelindaba, which has made Africa a nuclear-
weapon-free zone.
Today, on the threshold of the third millennium and
faced with the numerous challenges arising out of the
phenomenon of globalization at
the national and
international levels, Benin considers that the time has
come for the countries of the zone to strengthen their
efforts so as to reap greater benefit from the many
economic and commercial opportunities offered by the
zone. We must also strengthen our cooperation in
environmental protection and in activities aimed at
combating drug trafficking throughout the region.
The fifth meeting of States members of the zone, to
be held in 1998 and which Argentina has offered to host,
must be the forum for determining ways and means of
achieving those objectives. My country will spare no
effort
in contributing to the implementation of such
initiatives.
Mr. Ayewah (Nigeria): In contributing to the debate
on the zone of peace and cooperation of the South
Atlantic, the Nigerian delegation wishes to express its
appreciation to States Members of the United Nations and
General Assembly
Fifty-second session
to the international community at large for their continued
support of
the zone as a forum designed to further
cooperation among countries of the South in their pursuit of
peace and development.
In confronting the issues of peace and security,
member States of the zone have equally brought to the fore
problems associated with crisis management and conflict
resolution. It is in this connection that one must advert to
the difficult situations in a number of countries members of
the zone. Some of these difficult situations have found
solutions, while others have proved intractable. Liberia is an
example of those crisis situations that have found a solution
— albeit after a protracted effort. Today, Liberia can be
described as a success story. But on the other side of the
coin is the continuing crisis in Angola. Regrettably, Sierra
Leone and the Congo have joined the list of intractable
circumstances that need the collaborative efforts of the
international community in order to find durable solutions
to the problems besetting the two countries.
The member States of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) took the bull by the horns
and, with the support of the international community,
succeeded in solving the Liberian problem. We look
forward to similar cooperation in relation to the solution of
the problem in Sierra Leone in order to reinstate President
Kabbah and restore constitutional order to that country. In
this regard we commend the initiative of ECOWAS and the
action of the Security Council for the embargo which the
latter imposed in its resolution 1132 (1997) of 8 October
1997 on the sale and supply of petroleum and petroleum
products, and arms and related matériel of all types, to
Sierra Leone, along with other measures. We also look
forward to a hitch-free implementation of the peace plan
agreed in Conakry on 23 October between the ECOWAS
Committee of Five on Sierra Leone and representatives of
the junta. We are, of course, glad that the peace plan has
been accepted by President Kabbah himself.
It is appropriate at this point to reiterate the need for
the provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance in
response to local needs in that particular country. It is
equally important that all States and relevant international
organizations continue to assist those countries that have to
grapple with the influx of refugees and displaced persons as
a result of the crisis in Sierra Leone.
Along with other members of
the international
community, Nigeria welcomes the return of stability to the
Democratic Republic of
the Congo, which has great
implications for broader subregional peace, security and

Council has not been more forthcoming with regard to the
situation in the neighbouring Republic of the Congo. The
crisis in that country has resulted in the displacement of
over two thirds of the residents of Brazzaville and in the
extensive destruction of the city's infrastructure. The crisis
has been further complicated by the involvement of
external forces. We can only plead that all concerned
pursue the logic of peace. In this regard, we commend the
mediatory role of Gabon and other countries in the region
for their efforts in favour of peace in the subregion.
One of the expressed desires of the members of the
zone is for the South Atlantic to be free of nuclear
weapons. The conclusion of the Treaty of Pelindaba,
taken with the authority of the already established Treaty
of Tlatelolco, will, when they both come into full
operation, move us towards the realization of that goal.
These two nuclear-weapon-free-zone treaties,

with the treaties of Raratonga and Bangkok and the

out of their future.

against drug trafficking and protection of the marine

zone of peace
Mr. Felicio (Brazil): The
and
cooperation of the South Atlantic is of great importance to
Brazil. Our country had the honour to host two of the
ministerial meetings of the members of the zone, the first
in Rio de Janeiro in 1986, and the second in Brasilia in
1994. Brazil was present at the meeting in Abuja, Nigeria,
in 1990, and took part in the fourth ministerial meeting,
held in Somerset West, South Africa, in 1996. We look
forward to the meeting to be held in Argentina next year.
The countries of Africa and South America on both
sides of the Atlantic Ocean have taken the initiative to build
a bridge of understanding across that vast expanse of sea
between our shores. The aim is to foster mutual knowledge,
increase cooperation, give new life to old ties, search for
solutions to common problems, learn from each other's
experiences and, where possible, act together in shaping a
common future.
The near completion of the process of decolonization
made it possible for
the South Atlantic countries to
establish closer political and economic relations and to
further the endeavour of working towards more effective
ways to build peace and prosperity. The zone of peace and
cooperation of the South Atlantic is an attempt in that
direction that
is gradually becoming an invaluable
instrument to both African and South American countries.
The initiatives undertaken in the areas of protection of
the marine

prohibition of nuclear weapons point to priority areas where

the southern hemisphere and adjacent areas, established
by the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty (Treaty of

Zone Treaty (Treaty of Bangkok).
With the aim of assuring protection of the marine
environment, especially the conservation of marine living
resources and the prevention and containment of
environmental accidents, the countries of the zone have
started to exchange relevant information. This exercise
should continue. In this context,
the navies of some
member States of the zone have been developing efforts
to improve their capacity to work together.
Brazil has also sought to improve ways and means
of cooperating with other members of the zone in the
combat against
the traffic in illicit drugs, a growing
problem on the two sides of the Atlantic, and member
countries have started to coordinate their activities in
multilateral forums.
Another important area for the member countries of
the zone is the promotion of democracy, political
pluralism and national reconciliation. The draft resolution
introduced today makes reference to developments in
Liberia, Sierra Leone and Angola since last year and calls
for increased humanitarian assistance for Liberia and
Angola.
The Brazilian Government, within the limits of its
resources, is committed to continued cooperation with
other South Atlantic countries in all the areas I have
mentioned. For the member countries of the zone, the

Among the key ideas that led to the creation of the
United Nations, one must quite rightly give pride of place
to the idea of a culture of peace, as contained in the
preamble to the Charter, reflecting the determination of the
peoples of the world, having emerged from two world
conflicts
“to practice tolerance and live together in peace with
one another as good neighbours”.
16
50th plenary meeting
20 November 1997
We can thus see the concept of the culture of peace
thus finds its source in the values and aspirations
underpinning the foundation of the universal Organization
that was created — and we can never repeat it often
enough —
“to save succeeding generations from the scourge of
war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold
sorrow to mankind”.
By and large, the idea of the culture of peace rests
essentially on the repudiation of violence. It invokes all
the values, attitudes and behaviours reflecting and
furthering tolerance and solidarity. Its foundations are the
principles of liberty, justice and democracy. The idea of
the culture of peace seeks, lastly, to prevent conflicts at
their source and to resolve problems through dialogue and
negotiation.
The logic of mistrust and confrontation that
characterized the cold war period frustrated the full
expression of
the culture of peace. Paradoxically,
however, the end of the cold war, although bringing with
it a multitude of beneficial changes — notably,
in
relations among countries — has not after all prevented
the proliferation of explosions of violence, such as we
have witnessed in numerous inter-ethnic conflicts in
recent years.
The reality of this end of the century is all too full
of scenes of armed conflict, civil war, genocide and
wandering masses of refugees and displaced persons
fleeing massacres. All this calls out to conscience and
places the international community face to face with its
responsibility in this arena.
With respect
to this situation, we should in all
honesty recognize the proven capability of the United
Nations to manage crisis situations, as shown by its many
successes in many different peacekeeping operations.
Decisive United Nations action in these situations
has contributed to saving many human lives, which gives
us enormous satisfaction, and we hope that everything
possible will be done to enhance the United Nations
capability in the fields of peacekeeping, preventive action
and emergency humanitarian assistance.
Nevertheless, we note that the specific timing of
peacekeeping operations, inasmuch as they are always
rapid responses to emergencies, restricts their long-term
be

complemented by in-depth activities, especially educational
activities, aimed at inculcating a culture of peace in the
societies in question. Substantive work is therefore required
so that the structures and institutional manifestations of war,
and their deeper roots — namely, the culture of violence
and war — can be transformed into a culture of peace.
The following extract
from the preamble to the
Constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), reflects precisely
this same concern in affirming that
“since wars began in the minds of men, it is in the
minds of men that the defences of peace must be
constructed”.
The transition from a culture of war to a culture of
peace seems to us, therefore, to be the essential backdrop
to all United Nations activities in dealing with the
numerous challenges emerging on the horizon of the new
millennium.
It
is fitting here to pay a resounding tribute to
UNESCO, which, under the dynamic leadership of its
Director-General has set, as a priority goal for its work,
raising awareness to promote the transition from a culture
of war to a culture of peace. But in the final analysis, it is
up to all of us, large and small nations alike, each at its
own level and pace, to work jointly to accomplish this lofty
undertaking that can only foster tolerance, solidarity and
harmony between peoples and between nations.
It is in this spirit that Côte d'Ivoire initiated draft
resolution A/52/L.15,
recommending to the General
Assembly the proclamation of
the year 2000 as the
International Year for the Culture of Peace. We consider
the choice of
fundamental
importance in launching the promotion of the culture of
peace at a global level.
the year 2000 to be of
The aim is to harness the symbolism inherent in the
year 2000, as it is an emblem of, inter alia, ideas of
renewal and hope for a more peaceful world. The year 2000
must help us reinvent peace. The beginning of
the
millennium should therefore be marked by a mobilization
of national and international public opinion, directed
particularly towards young people, inviting them to make
a difference and encouraging them to break once and for all
with the behaviour patterns and attitudes of the recent and
the more distant past, characterized by crises, wars and
violence.

as well as by the international community, aimed at
creating and promoting a culture of peace in people's
minds, beginning with the next century.
the turn of
The proclamation of an International Year for the
Culture of Peace is intended as a force for raising public
awareness, at the dawn of the new millennium, of the
need for a culture of peace in the daily life of societies,
with particular attention to young people.
The programme for and the financing of activities
marking the celebration of the International Year for the
Culture of Peace are in keeping with the guidelines
adopted by the General Assembly. Indeed, UNESCO
intends to take the necessary steps to coordinate a
programme of activities that will be financed entirely by
voluntary contributions.
In taking the initiative of introducing draft resolution
A/52/L.15, Côte d'Ivoire retains the image that the entire
world has of it, as a country of peace, tolerance, solidarity
and shared happiness. The history of our young nation,
fashioned by the enlightened vision of the father of
modern Côte d'Ivoire,
the late President Houphouet-
Boigny, has been a happy succession of victories for
peace that have inevitably given rise to prosperity. Since
1989 Côte d'Ivoire has marked 15 November as a day for
the celebration of peace.
This pact with peace and progress is continuing
harmoniously under President Henri Konan Bédié, who is
furthermore sparing no effort in advancing democracy and

“For the Ivoirian, peace is a second religion. It is the
most precious good that President Houphouet-
Boigny bequeathed to us. In Côte d'Ivoire we think
of peace as something patiently constructed out of
love for others, tolerance, justice and a common
striving for development, all of which are propelled
by constant dialogue and the quest for compromise.
Our philosophy and our political practice, our
actions and our energies, are all centred on the

continuous and persistent search for peace through
dialogue.”
In 1989 the international dimension of peace was
enshrined in Côte d'Ivoire with UNESCO's creation of the
international Houphouet-Boigny Prize, awarded each year
to
“honour people, institutions or organizations that have
significantly contributed to promoting,
seeking,
safeguarding or maintaining peace.”
This prize was awarded for the first time in 1991, to
Presidents Nelson Mandela and Frederik de Klerk. They
were followed in 1992 by The Hague Academy of
International Law. The late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
President Yasser Arafat and Prime Minister Shimon Peres
were honoured in 1993, King Juan Carlos of Spain and
President Jimmy Carter of the United States in 1994, and
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees in 1995. Most recently, in 1997, it was awarded
to President Alvaro Arzú Irigoyen of Guatemala and
Commander Rolando Morán, head of
the Unidad
Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG), both of
whom deserve credit for agreeing to put an end to 36 years
of civil war in Guatemala.
We are delighted to note, as the report of
the
Secretary-General in document A/52/292 points out, that the
culture of peace is being implemented by many other
countries throughout the world. I need mention only a few
of the many examples.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, ministerial-level
meetings,
seminars and training sessions have been
organized by UNESCO on issues relating to human rights,
democracy, peace and development. The culture of peace
has already been introduced in university curriculums in the
Caribbean. A mayors' prize for peace was awarded for the
first
the
international congress on cities and education for the culture
of peace, which was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in
September 1996. The prize was awarded to Mrs. Gloria
Cuertas Montoya, mayor of the city of Apartadó, Colombia.

General Assembly at
its fifty-second session on 22
October:
(spoke in English)
“We believe that
the promotion and further
consolidation of a culture of peace should be the
next most important challenge to all societies as well
as to each individual citizen.” [Official Records of
the General Assembly, Fifty-second session, Plenary
Meetings, 35th meeting, p. 2]
(spoke in French)
Peace, democracy and development are, today more
than ever, crucial and indispensable elements for human
development within a society committed to progress.
Peace, democracy and development form an interactive
triangle that gains its vitality from the culture of peace.
But peace remains a constant quest, a long-term
endeavour that requires daily effort. We thus prepare for
peace through a long process that takes into account all
generations in society: by training children so that they
can internalize and accept the values of peace; by re-
educating adults so that they learn anew to accept racial
differences,
respect cultural diversity and live with
tolerance; and by inviting the elderly to reach out in
forgiveness and reconciliation, especially when the
memory of the past is still alive.
We are on the eve of a new millennium.
Globalization and the worldwide spread of all we do are
accelerating thanks to the extraordinary progress of
science and technology and their dissemination.
The world is changing and we must adopt new
behaviour patterns. We must resolutely turn our backs on
the ordeals, horrors and errors of the past. We need to
look to the future with confidence and to see to it that the
twenty-first century is one of non-violence, peace,

democracy, progress for all and shared happiness. That is
why we must now move to give the culture of peace a
chance.
I therefore hope that the General Assembly will adopt
draft resolution A/52/L.15, entitled “Proclamation of the
year 2000 as the International Year for the Culture of
Peace”, without a vote.
The Acting President: I call on the representative of
Argentina to introduce draft resolution A/52/L.18.
(Argentina)
Ms. Ramírez
(interpretation
from
Spanish): I have the honour to introduce draft resolution
A/52/L.18, entitled “Year 2000: International Year of
Thanksgiving”, which is sponsored by Bangladesh, Brazil,
Cape Verde, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Côte d'Ivoire,
Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras,
Kyrgyzstan, the Marshall Islands, Nicaragua, Paraguay, the
Philippines, Swaziland, Trinidad and Tobago, the United
States of America, Uruguay and Venezuela as well as my
own country, Argentina.
The sponsors of this initiative consider that it makes
a contribution of the most far-reaching importance in order
to give real meaning and depth to the concept of gratitude,
and to lead us to reflect on how to develop and stimulate
all
those actions that contribute to understanding and
national reconciliation.
The Republic of Argentina welcomes this initiative
with particular interest as it shares in the concern about the
situation that mankind is experiencing today, particularly
the most disadvantaged and vulnerable. This situation has
prompted our country to work actively in the international
arena in areas afflicted by natural disasters,
regional
conflicts or other emergencies.
We live in times of profound global change that
involve the entire world and that give rise to uncertainty
and unease as to the future. In this context, it is a challenge
for us to give new substance to our commitment and
solidarity, leaving behind isolationist and individualist views
of international relations or a memory of the past.
It is necessary, therefore, for there to be consensus as
to the need to build international action in the field of
cooperation and humanitarian assistance, on the basis of a
joint effort by the international community.
In this
to proclaim the year 2000 as
International Year of Thanksgiving — beyond the objective
sense,

of highlighting once again the community of universal
values that link the different peoples of the world — has
a more profound meaning, insofar as the message of
thanksgiving tends to alleviate the suffering and poverty
resulting from natural disasters and warlike conflict
through the search for equity and justice.
Likewise, we believe that this initiative will give
future generations an opportunity to join in projects that
strengthen international cooperation and share in cultural
celebrations generating peace and reconciliation.
More than 50 years after the convening of the San
Francisco Conference, we still have the same trust and

In this context, the declaration of the year 2000 as
International Year of Thanksgiving will provide a unique
opportunity for us to come together again in the spirit
which spurred the Organization's founders. It is this spirit
that should guide our actions in order to realize the high
ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.
For all these reasons, we hope that draft resolution
A/52//18 will be adopted.

The idea of an International Year of Volunteers

Nations Volunteer Programme and the United Nations
University in Japan in 1996, where I had the honour of
being a keynote speaker. This initiative was subsequently

Volunteer service — the contributions that individuals
make as non-profit and non-career activities to enhance the
well-being of the less fortunate — has been a part of every
civilization and society. Today, volunteers are active in a
wide range of areas,
including welfare, environment,
education, human rights, and disaster relief, where efforts
on a volunteer basis complement governmental activities in
these fields at the grass-roots level. The need for volunteer
efforts is greater now than ever before and likely to grow
greater still. Yet, while the contribution of volunteers is
vast, much of their work often goes unrecognized because
it does not
involve the payment of market wages and
because it is often spontaneous, informal and unstructured.

resolution,
The Assembly has before it two draft resolutions
proclaiming the year 2001 the International Year of
Volunteers. As a matter of procedure, the Secretariat
distributed draft resolution A/52/L.21, which has the same
content as the resolution adopted at
the substantive
session of the Economic and Social Council last July.
However,
there are 123 sponsors of draft resolution
A/52/L.22; in addition to those countries mentioned in it,
they now include Barbados, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam,
the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of
the Congo,
the Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Liberia,
Nepal, Norway, Mali, Paraguay, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Uruguay.
All of them have become sponsors after the submission
of the draft resolution, and would like to propose that
action be taken only on A/52/L.22, the shorter version of
the draft resolution. Draft resolution A/52/L.22 represents
the result of efforts by the sponsors to avoid the repetition
of adopting in the General Assembly a draft resolution
with precisely the same content as the resolution adopted
by the Economic and Social Council. Accordingly,
A/52/L.21 can be seen as a reference to A/52/L.22. I hope
that this proposal of the sponsors, guided by the spirit of
desiring to rationalize the work of the General Assembly,
will be accepted in that spirit by all Member States.
The Acting President: In view of the statement by
the representative of Japan, may I take it that the General
Assembly decides not to take action on draft resolution
A/52/L.21?
It was so decided.
The Acting President: The Assembly will now take
a decision on draft resolutions A/52/L.15, L.18 and L.22,
one by one.

economy. From our perspective, the United Nations in its
entirety, and its specialized agencies and funds and
programmes in particular, can indeed play a very active and
constructive role in this regard. The United Nations system
can,
inter alia, contribute to identifying areas of, and
exploring
and
interregional cooperation. The important and valuable
activities currently being undertaken in this regard by the
regional commissions deserve to be commended. In this

Representing the delegation of the Islamic Republic
of Iran, the current coordinator of the ECO contact group
in New York, I have the honour to introduce to the
General Assembly, on behalf of its sponsors the draft
resolution under the agenda item entitled “Cooperation
between
the Economic
Cooperation Organization”. The report of the United
Nations Secretary-General on the agenda item under
consideration shows that cooperation between the United
Nations and ECO has evolved in a satisfactory manner
and presents a very promising outlook. Optimal utilization
of the existing potentialities in the ECO region in various
fields and areas will
indeed be much facilitated and
rendered more efficient and effective through the
assistance of the United Nations system, in particular its
specialized agencies involved in the field of operational
activities.

Fifty-second session
Draft resolution A/52/L.20 is, as a matter of fact, an
updated version of a similar resolution adopted by the
General Assembly last year, with, of course, a few
additions. It reflects the state of cooperation between the
two organizations. While laying out the background of that
cooperation and taking stock of the achievements so far, the
draft resolution is also forward-looking in its approach to
the future.
Addressing the future of a positively evolving
relationship between the United Nations and ECO, the draft
resolution spells out the areas of general cooperation with
the United Nations system and also puts forward a number
of areas of priority for ECO and its member States. I shall
underline just a few of the salient points in this regard.

I should now, on behalf of the sponsors,
like to
indicate some changes to the text, which I shall present
orally.
In the second line of the fourth preambular paragraph,
which begins “Bearing in mind,” the year “1997” should be
corrected to “1977”, and the year “1977” farther along in
that line should be changed to “1996”.
In paragraph 6,
the words “Calls upon” at
the
beginning of the paragraph should be replaced with the
word “Invites”. In the second line of the same paragraph,
the first word, “favourable,” should be replaced with the
word “appropriate”.
Lastly, in paragraph 8, line 5, the words “inter alia”
should be inserted after the words “technical assistance”.
To conclude, let me just add on behalf of the sponsors
of draft resolution A/52/L.20, as orally amended, that this
draft resolution represents a humble effort on the part of a
dynamic regional organization in a sensitive area of the

world. It reflects the dedication of ECO to the further
promotion of regional cooperation and the attainment of
higher levels of economic well-being and development for
its member States and the region at large.
Having said that, on behalf of the sponsors, I invite
the General Assembly to adopt by consensus the draft
resolution contained in document A/52/L.20, as orally
amended, as the Assembly did in the case of a similar
draft resolution last year.
The Acting President: In accordance with General
Assembly resolution 48/2 of 13 October 1993, I now call
on the Secretary-General of the Economic Cooperation
Organization, Mr. Onder Ozar.
Mr. Ozar (Economic Cooperation Organization): As
the Economic Cooperation
the Secretary-General of
Organization (ECO), it is my privilege and honour to
address this body on an agenda item which is of vital
importance for the member States of our organization.
The Economic Cooperation Organization is a
regional grouping devoted to the socio-economic well-
being of its 10 member States, which are located in a
region that encompasses more than 7 million square
kilometres and is inhabited by nearly 320 million people.
In this richly endowed region, ECO is playing a pivotal
role to promote economic cooperation among member
countries and provide the framework for an infrastructural
network connecting the newly independent Republics of
Central Asia and Azerbaijan to the rest of the world
through the road, maritime and air
links of
the
neighbouring countries: Iran, Pakistan and Turkey.
a
upon
I would like to inform representatives that soon after
its expansion in November 1992 from three to 10 member
States, ECO embarked
comprehensive
restructuring and reorganization. Two plans of action
were adopted in 1993, namely the Quetta Plan of Action
and the Istanbul Declaration, both stipulating concrete
targets to be achieved in the next 10 years, as well as a
project-oriented Almaty Outline Plan for the Development
of Transport Sector in the ECO Region. Lately, at the
Fourth ECO Summit Meeting in Ashgabat in May 1996,
an overall strategy for the ECO region and several
documents on the reorganization and restructuring of ECO
were adopted. Moreover, steps have been taken to
establish regional institutions. Currently, ECO is in the
process of implementing those decisions.

Scientific
So as to pursue our objectives in a coordinated manner
and in harmony with the global trends, we are working
closely with the United Nations and its specialized agencies
towards the attainment of our common objectives in the
ECO region. ECO acquired observer status at the United
Nations on 13 October 1993 through resolution 48/2.
Cooperation between the United Nations and ECO has been
further strengthened through the adoption of resolutions
50/1 and 51/21, adopted respectively on 12 October 1995
and 27 November 1996. These resolutions are helping to
facilitate and strengthen ECO's relations with the major
agencies of the United Nations system. We have established
cooperative relationships with several United Nations
agencies and funds and programmes that are now carrying
out joint activities with ECO. They include the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations
Educational,
and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO), the United Nations Industrial Development
Organization (UNIDO), the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP), the United Nations International Drug
Control Programme (UNDCP) and the United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA). ECO has jointly held three
important conferences with UNFPA and four workshops
with UNICEF. Our cooperation with the Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has
also grown considerably and is expanding. Currently,
several projects are being carried out jointly. UNDCP has
also worked out a project proposal
in the
implementation of ECO's plan on drug control. Similarly,
UNDP is preparing a study on the economies and resource
complementarities of ECO member States, a draft of which
has already been circulated among member States. The
holding of a workshop, with the participation of UNDP, to
discuss the outcome of this study is under consideration.
Also, another study on enhancing the effectiveness of the
new wing of the ECO secretariat comprising research and
project units has been carried out by a UNDP senior
consultant. We are grateful to have received the working
draft of this study, which has been circulated among
member States for consideration.
to assist
In view of the growing trend towards interregional
cooperation, ECO is also part of an annual consultative
process with Asia's major subregional organizations, which
is coordinated by ESCAP. The third consultative meeting
of the heads of these organizations was held in Tehran last
May. Details of these joint efforts of ECO and United
Nations agencies are reflected in good measure in the report
of the Secretary-General of 29 August 1997, which is
contained in document A/52/313 and has been submitted
under the present agenda item.
