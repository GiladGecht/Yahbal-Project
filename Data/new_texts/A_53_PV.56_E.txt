The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.
Agenda item 15
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs
(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic and
Social Council
The President (interpretation from Spanish): This
morning the General Assembly will proceed to the election
of 18 members of the Economic and Social Council to
replace those members whose term of office expires on
31 December 1998.
The 18 outgoing members are Argentina, Bangladesh,
Canada, the Central African Republic, China, the Czech
Republic, Finland, Gabon, Guyana, Jordan, Lebanon,
Nicaragua, Romania,
the Russian Federation, Sweden,
Togo, Tunisia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland.
As of 1 January 1999,
the following States will
continue to be represented on the Economic and Social
Council: Algeria, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Cape Verde,
Chile, Colombia, the Comoros, Cuba, Djibouti, El Salvador,
France, the Gambia, Germany, Iceland, India, Italy, Japan,
Latvia, Lesotho, Mauritius, Mexico, Mozambique, New
Zealand, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, the Republic of Korea,
Saint Lucia, Sierra Leone, Spain, Sri Lanka, Turkey, the
United States of America, Viet Nam and Zambia. The
names of these 36 States should therefore not appear on the
ballots.
In accordance with paragraph 4 of General Assembly
resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971, and taking
into account the number of States which will remain
members of the Council after 1 January 1999, the 18
members should be elected as follows: four from African
States, three from Latin American and Caribbean States,
four from Asian States, four from Western European and
other States and three from Eastern European States. The
ballot papers reflect this pattern.
I should like to inform the Assembly that
the
number of candidates, not exceeding the number of seats
to be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a
two-thirds majority of those present and voting will be
declared elected. In the case of a tie vote for a remaining
seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to those
candidates which have obtained an equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to
this procedure?
It was so decided.
The President (interpretation from Spanish): In
accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the
election shall be held by secret ballot, and there shall be
no nominations.
Regarding candidatures, I have been informed by the
Chairmen of the regional groups that, for the four vacant
seats from among the African States, the four endorsed
candidates are the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Guinea-Bissau, Morocco and Rwanda.

In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure,
we shall now proceed to the election by secret ballot.
Ballot papers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E” will

relevant region than the number of seats assigned to it will
be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a ballot
paper which do not belong to that region will not be
counted at all.

Rica), Mr. Osel-Danquah (Ghana), Mr. Sgouropoulos
(Greece), Mr. Rózsa (Hungary) and Mr. Misran

(interpretation from Spanish):
Two seats from among the Eastern European States

in view of the late hour, I propose that we postpone
