Social Council
The President (interpretation from Spanish): This
afternoon, the General Assembly will continue with the
election of 18 members of the Economic and Social
Council to replace those members whose term of office
expires on 31 December 1998.
As members will
recall, when the 56th plenary

two seats from among the Eastern European States to be

In accordance with the rules of procedure, we shall
proceed now to the second round of balloting, by secret
ballot, for the remaining two seats.
This second round of balloting shall be restricted to
the four States from among the Eastern European States
that were not elected but that obtained the largest number
of votes in the previous ballot — namely, Bulgaria, the
Czech Republic, the Republic of Moldova and the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
This is in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of
procedure.
