The meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.
Tribute to the memory of the first President of the
United Republic of Tanzania, His Excellency Mr. Julius
Nyerere, and the staff members of the United Nations
killed in Kosovo and Burundi
The President: It is with deep personal sadness that
I learned of the passing of Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere, first
President of the United Republic of Tanzania, a venerable
world leader and one of Africa's most charismatic and
respected elder statesmen. He died overnight in London at
the age of 77 after suffering from leukaemia.
President Nyerere's life was legendary. Born in 1922
in a village near Lake Victoria, he entered politics in 1954,
founding the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU),
and the campaign for independence from colonial rule. He
became Chief Minister of British-ruled Tanganyika in 1960.
He then led his country to independence in 1961, serving
first as Prime Minister and, from 1964, as President of the
United Republic of Tanzania.
Mwalimu was the pillar of his nation's politics and a
mediator whose wise counsel other world leaders sought.
He stepped down voluntarily in 1985, one of a very few
African leaders of his generation to do so.
I,
too, was a beneficiary of Mwalimu's political
tutelage and of Tanzania's generosity. They provided me
with a free haven when I fled my own country, Namibia,
in 1962 to escape South Africa's brutal apartheid
colonialism in Namibia.
their

The Tanzanian people have lost the father of their

nation,
struggle and the architect of the United Republic of
Tanzania. The African people as a whole have lost an
ardent pan-Africanist, a man of high principles, a man of
self-abnegation and a
champion of African self-
determination, liberation and independence. Without Mr.
Nyerere's firm guidance and steadfast support,
the
struggle for liberation, particularly in southern Africa,
would have been even more difficult and divisive within
the ranks of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
the Non-Aligned Movement and other freedom-loving
forces in the world. Mwalimu was the force behind the
southern African front-line States and their foremost
strategist and intellectual mentor.
Mwalimu's contributions to public life did not end
with his retirement from office. He served as Chairman of
the South Commission from 1987 to 1990 and was later
named Honorary Chairman of
the intergovernmental
South Centre, which promotes South-South cooperation
and solidarity.
At the time of his death, President Nyerere was
serving as chief mediator in the negotiations to end the
civil war in Burundi. He devoted much of his time to
seeking African solutions to African problems, working
diligently to promote African unity.
On behalf of the General Assembly and in my own
personal capacity, I extend heartfelt condolences to his
bereaved family and to the courageous people of Tanzania
at the passing of their founding father and extraordinary
leader.

General Assembly
Fifty-fourth session
It is also my sad duty to pay tribute to the memory of
the staff members of the United Nations who were recently
killed in Kosovo and Burundi in the line of duty.
Once again, United Nations staff members have paid
the ultimate price in the line of duty. They sacrificed their
lives in Kosovo and Burundi while serving the cause of
peace. The loss of three staff members within a 24-hour
period underscores the often difficult and dangerous
conditions under which United Nations personnel serve.
The deaths of Valentin Krumov in Kosovo and of Luis
Zuniga and Saskia von Meijenfeldt in Burundi bring to 13
the number of civilian staff killed this year alone in the
field of operations. This saddening statistic indicates a sharp
increase in attacks on United Nations personnel and calls
for effective measures by Governments, and particularly
parties in conflict situations,
to ensure the safety and
security of United Nations personnel and other humanitarian
workers.
I strongly condemn these wanton acts of brutality
against peacemakers and peace workers and call upon the
international community to assist the United Nations in
further intensifying public education with the view to
putting an end to the loss of innocent lives.
In Kosovo, on Monday evening, Mr. Valentin
Krumov, a 38- year-old Bulgarian national, was brutally
assaulted by a crowd and then shot dead on a street in
Pristina. Mr. Krumov had just arrived in that city to take up
his
Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). He became
UNMIK's first casualty. An eyewitness reported that he was
shot after replying in Serbian when asked for the time.
the United Nations
assignment with
In Burundi, on 12 October, Mr. Luis Zuniga, a 52-
year-old Chilean national and a representative of the United
Nations Children's Fund, and Ms. Saskia von Meijenfeldt,
a 34-year-old Dutch national and a logistics officer with the
World Food Programme, were killed in a road ambush.
They were part of an inter-agency team that was carrying
out an assessment of humanitarian needs in a camp for
displaced persons. Seven Burundian nationals also lost their
lives and several others were seriously injured in that
terrible tragedy.
Justice demands that the perpetrators of these heinous
crimes be apprehended and prosecuted. Such criminal acts
committed within the territory of a Member State must not
go unpunished. While many such incidents are carried out
by lawless elements outside the control of Governments,

adherence

scrupulous
Member States can and must play a decisive role by
ensuring
international
humanitarian law instruments,
including the relevant
conventions. The 1994 Convention on the Safety of
United Nations and Associated Personnel, which entered
into force this year, establishes the legal framework for
protecting United Nations staff members in situations of
armed conflict.
Today, we mourn the untimely deaths of staff
members whose loyalty and commitment to the noble
ideals of the United Nations remained unflinching to their
last breath. In this hour of sorrow and bereavement, I
commend the courage and dedication of those who
faithfully put their lives on the line in the service of the
United Nations and of humanity. It was with this in mind
that I told United Nations personnel last month, on the
occasion of the Millennium Staff Day, “You are the
lifeblood of the United Nations”. For whenever a staff
member is killed in the line of duty, all of us bleed. We
must ensure the safety and security of those who carry the
United Nations flag, especially staff members in the field
in peacekeeping missions or at United Nations outposts
throughout the world.
On behalf of the General Assembly, I extend our
deepest condolences and heartfelt sympathy to the
bereaved families and friends of those who lost their lives
in the cause of peace. Let us today pledge, individually
and collectively, to do all in our power to stem the tide of
violence that destroys hope and impedes peacekeeping
and peace enforcement in the world.
I call now on the Deputy Secretary-General.
The Deputy Secretary-General: Let me start, Mr.
President, by joining you in paying homage to Julius
Nyerere, the founder and first President of the United
Republic of Tanzania, an architect of the Organization of
African Unity and one of the giants of the twentieth-
century African liberation movement. He was Mwalimu,
or Teacher, to us all, and his death takes from us a good
friend and a tireless supporter of the United Nations.
As I address the General Assembly this morning, the
following scenes are unfolding elsewhere: the family of
Valentin Krumov of Bulgaria is mourning his brutal
murder in Pristina on the very day he took up his duties
there. The families of Luis Zuniga of Chile and of Saskia
von Meijenfeldt of the Netherlands are preparing to bury
their loved ones, killed in cold blood while on a mission
in Burundi to assess humanitarian needs. And the families

of still more United Nations colleagues, held hostage in
Georgia, are waiting in anguish for word of their fate.
or over factions within them, to bring their forces under
better control and discipline.
Such incidents — killings, assaults, harassment,
kidnappings — have become far too routine in conflict
zones throughout
the world. United Nations staff have
become targets, not through any fault of their own but
because there are those who seek advantage in flouting
international humanitarian norms and simple human
decency.
All too often the targeting is deliberate, directed not
only against United Nations staff but also against non-
governmental organizations and the International Committee
of the Red Cross. This is not only wrong; it is depriving the
international community of a precious tool with which to
relieve the suffering caused by war and humanitarian
emergencies.
Some will say there is little that can be done against
hatred and violence. I beg to differ, and I do so in the
strongest possible terms. Some things are indeed beyond
our control, but much is within it. Member States bear
primary responsibility for ensuring the security of United
Nations staff. Here are some measures they can take: first,
they can conduct vigorous investigations into all such
killings and incidents, prosecuting those responsible to the
full extent of the law. To our knowledge, only one person
has ever been found guilty and has been imprisoned for
killing or causing the death of a United Nations staff
member. This impunity cannot be allowed to stand.
Secondly, those who have not done so already can
sign and ratify two conventions. The Convention on the
Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel has
come into force at long last, but only 29 nations have
ratified it. The Rome Statute for an International Criminal
Court, not yet in force, will make it a war crime to attack
personnel
involved in a humanitarian-assistance or
peacekeeping mission pursued in accordance with the
United Nations Charter.
Thirdly, Member States can provide the funding
needed to improve staff security. We need more security
officers and stress counsellors, and more training. Improved
security is not a luxury. It should be viewed, as it would be
in any private firm, as an essential operating cost.
And fourthly, Member States can use their influence
over those who control
the territories in which these
atrocities occur. They can exert more influence over States,
We all know that risk is part of our jobs. But a
desperate irony is developing: Member States are willing
to send unarmed civilians into places where they will not
send well armed soldiers. As the Secretary-General has
said to them in the past, these are your own citizens who
are venturing into peril. Let us consider what more we
can do, on an urgent basis, to ensure that they can carry
out their vital work in safety. Let us send our prayers to
all who are mourning today.
And let us recognize that if we fail to act there will
be more families and friends who will mourn tomorrow,
and the day after that. That is not something any of us
would wish on any other human being, or want to have
on our conscience. So we must prevent it.
The President:I now invite representatives to stand
and observe a minute of silence in tribute to the memory
of those deceased staff members.
The members of the General Assembly observed a
minute of silence.
Agenda item 125
Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the
expenses of the United Nations
The President: I should like to inform members that
the Gambia has made the necessary payment to reduce its
arrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the
Charter.
May I take it that the General Assembly duly takes
note of this information?
It was so decided.
The President: In this connection, a new document
will be issued tomorrow morning under the symbol
A/54/464.
Agenda item 15
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs
(a) Election of five non-permanent members of the
Security Council
3
General Assembly
Fifty-fourth session
The President: The General Assembly will now
proceed to the election of five non-permanent members of
the Security Council to replace those members whose term
of office expires on 31 December 1999.
The five non-permanent outgoing members are the
following: Bahrain, Brazil, Gabon,
the Gambia and
Slovenia. These five States cannot be re-elected and
therefore their names should not appear on the ballot
papers.
Apart from the five permanent members, the Security
Council will include in the year 2000 the following States:
Argentina, Canada, Malaysia, Namibia and the Netherlands.
The names of those States, therefore, should also not appear
on the ballot papers.
Of the five non-permanent members which will remain
in office in the year 2000, two are from Africa and Asia,
one is from Latin America and the Caribbean and two are
from Western European and other States.
Consequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General
Assembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of 17 December 1963,
the five non-permanent members
should be elected
according to the following pattern: three from Africa and
Asia, one from Eastern Europe and one from Latin America
and the Caribbean. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.
In accordance with established practice, there is an
understanding to the effect that, of the three States to be
elected from Africa and Asia, two should be from Africa
and one from Asia.
I should like to inform the Assembly that the number
of candidates, not exceeding the number of seats to be
filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a two-
thirds majority of those present and voting will be declared
elected.
In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there
will be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates which
have obtained an equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that
procedure?
It was so decided.
The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the
rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret
ballot and there shall be no nominations.

34th plenary meeting
14 October 1999
Regarding candidatures, I have been informed by the
Chairmen of the respective regional groups that, for the
three vacant seats from among the African and Asian
States,
there are three endorsed candidates, namely,
Bangladesh, Mali and Tunisia.
From among the Eastern European States, there are
two candidates for one vacant seat. The candidates are
Slovakia and Ukraine.
As for the Latin American and Caribbean States,
Jamaica is the endorsed candidate for one vacant seat.
In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure,
we shall proceed now to the election by secret ballot.
Ballot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” will now be
distributed.
I request representatives to use only those ballot
papers that have been distributed and to write on them the
names of the five States for which they wish to vote.
A ballot paper containing more names from the
relevant region than the number of seats assigned to it
will be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a
ballot paper which do not belong to that region will not
be counted.

the tellers for their assistance in this election.
This concludes our consideration of sub-item (a) of
agenda item 15.
The meeting rose at 1.55 p.m.
Mr. Tomka (Slovakia): I should like to express my
Government's deepest gratitude to all delegations that lent
Slovakia their valuable support in its quest for membership
of the Security Council for the first time ever — to those
delegations that have promoted the principles of rotation
and equal opportunity. We are particularly grateful to them,
and will remember their support in our future work here in
the United Nations.
I now formally withdraw the candidature of Slovakia,
and wish Ukraine well.
The President: We shall now begin the voting
process, taking into consideration the statement just made

Since no candidate obtained the required two-thirds
majority, there still remains one seat to be filled, from
