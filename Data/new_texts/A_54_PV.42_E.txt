The President: I should like to inform members that
the Democratic Republic of the Congo has made the
necessary payment to reduce its arrears below the amount
specified in Article 19 of the Charter.

note of this information?
It was so decided.

an addendum to document A/54/464.
Agenda item 15

(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic and

The President: This morning the General Assembly

The 18 outgoing members are Cape Verde, Chile,
the Gambia,

In accordance with paragraph 4 of General Assembly
resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971, and taking
into account the number of States which will remain
members of the Council after 1 January 2000, the 18
members should be elected as follows: five from African
States,
three from Asian States, one from Eastern
European States, four from Latin American and Caribbean
States, and five from Western European and other States.
The ballot papers reflect this pattern.
I should like to inform the Assembly that those

receiving the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds
majority of those present and voting will be declared
elected. In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there
will be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates which
have obtained an equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to this
procedure?
It was so decided.
Ballot papers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E”
will now be distributed. I request representatives to use
only those ballot papers and to write on them the names
of the States for which they wish to vote.
A ballot paper containing more names from the
relevant region than the number of seats assigned to it
will be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a
ballot paper which do not belong to that region will not
be counted at all.
The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the rules
of procedure, the election shall be held by secret ballot, and
there shall be no nominations.
Regarding candidatures, I have been informed by the
Chairmen of the regional groups that for the five vacant
seats from among the African States, the five endorsed
candidates are Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon and
the Sudan.
For the three vacant seats from among the Asian

States,
Japan, Kazakhstan, Sri Lanka and Thailand.
For the one vacant seat from among the Eastern

European States,
Croatia, Hungary and Lithuania.

Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the

The President: Before we proceed further, I should
like to inform members that Seychelles has made the
necessary payment to reduce its arrears below the amount
specified in Article 19 of the Charter.
May I take it that the General Assembly duly takes
note of this information?
It was so decided.
In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure,
an addendum to document A/54/464 to be issued.
The President: This information will be reflected in
we shall now proceed to the election by secret ballot.
I should like to seek the usual cooperation of
representatives during the time of the conduct of the
election. As you are all aware, once the voting begins, all
campaigning should cease on the main floor of the General
Assembly Hall. This means in particular that until the
election is completed, no more campaign material can be
distributed inside the Hall. This includes the recess time
when the results are being tallied.
