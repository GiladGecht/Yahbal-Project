Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs

Social Council
The President: This afternoon the General Assembly
will continue with sub-item (b) of agenda item 15 on the
election of eighteen members of the Economic and Social
Council to replace those members whose term of office
expires on 31 December 1999.
As members will recall, when the 42nd plenary
meeting was adjourned earlier today, there still remained
four seats to be filled. In accordance with rule 92 of the
rules of procedure, we shall proceed now to the third round
of balloting, by secret ballot, for the remaining four seats.
As was announced at
this morning's meeting,
the
remaining four seats to be filled are: one from among the
Asian States, one from among the Eastern European States,
and two from among the Latin American and Caribbean
States.
The third round of balloting shall be restricted to the
two States from among the Asian States that were not
elected but obtained the largest number of votes in the
previous ballot, namely Fiji and Thailand; the two States
from among the Eastern European States that were not
elected but obtained the largest number of votes in the
previous ballot, namely Croatia and Lithuania; and the
four States
from among the Latin American and
Caribbean States that were not elected but obtained the
largest number of votes in the previous ballot, namely
Ecuador, Mexico, Suriname and Uruguay.
This is in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of
procedure.
I give the floor to the representative of Ecuador.
Mr. Alemán (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): The
process that
is taking place in the Assembly is a
democratic one. As my country believes in and practices
democracy, and given the results of the previous round of
balloting, we have decided to withdraw our candidacy. I
wish, however, to express our profound gratitude to all
friendly countries that have been so committed to us up
to this moment.

and Thailand for their cooperation.
Taking into account
the statements made by the
representatives of Ecuador and Thailand, we shall proceed

Mr. Barnnell (Guyana): I have the honour to speak
on behalf of the Group of 77 and China in explanation of
vote on agenda item 119, entitled “Programme budget for
the biennium 1998-1999”.
The Group of 77 and China welcomes the conclusion
the deliberations on the issue of modalities and
of
sustainability of the Development Account.
The Group of 77 and China welcomes the conclusion
of negotiations on the issue after difficult and lengthy
deliberations on the matter. In this process, the Group
demonstrated a spirit of cooperation and understanding in
6
43rd plenary meeting
29 October 1999
seeking consensus on this matter and looks forward to the
continuation of this spirit in further negotiations in the
Fifth Committee.
The Group's understanding of paragraph 2 of the
resolution is that the cumulative savings achieved as a
result of efficiency measures will be transferred to the
Development Account section in the budget, with prior
approval of the General Assembly, and will form the
maintenance base of the budget section relating to the
Development Account for subsequent bienniums.
The Group would once again like to reaffirm its
position that the operation of the Development Account
should be in accordance with the relevant regulations and
rules of the Organization, since it is part of the regular
budget. Further, it must neither be a budget- nor a staff-

Mr. Sareva (Finland): I have the honour to speak on
behalf of the European Union. The Central and Eastern
European countries associated with the European Union
— Bulgaria,
the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary,
Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and
Slovenia — and the associated countries Cyprus and

77 and China, in which he expressed the positions held by
my delegation.
I would first
like to thank the representative of
Uganda, Mr. Nester Odaga-Jalomayo, for his outstanding
work as coordinator for this draft resolution. Our deep
appreciation also goes to his predecessor, Mr. Humayun
Kabir of Bangladesh.
The European Union is pleased that we have adopted
by consensus the draft resolution in document A/54/508,
dealing with the modalities for operating the Development
Account. The preservation of consensus in the Fifth
Committee on budgetary matters is of great importance to
the European Union. It works to the advantage of all
Member States and serves the common good of the United
Nations. It means an approach of win-win and not zero-
sum.
The European Union has from the outset supported the
concept of the Development Account, as launched by the
Secretary-General as part of his Track II reform package.
We have also consistently supported the Secretary-General's
proposals on the modalities and sustainability of
the
Account. The resolution adequately reflects these proposals.
The Account is of a multi-year character, which provides
for increased flexibility in the use of funds. It does not
amount to a budget- or staff-reduction exercise. It excludes
an ex ante approval of the efficiency measures.
The adoption of this resolution will now enable the
Secretary-General to come up with detailed proposals for
the projects to be funded from the Account during the next
biennium. We look forward to the submission of these
proposals and expect that they will have succinct objectives,
measurable outcomes and clear performance indicators and
that they will complement existing programmes.
The President: I now call on the representative of
Cuba.
Ms. Buergo Rodríguez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): As
it has indicated on numerous occasions, my delegation fully
supports the establishment of the Development Account.
We are therefore very pleased that
this afternoon the
General Assembly has been able to adopt a definitive
decision on the modalities of
the
Account.

by the representative of Guyana on behalf of the Group of
However, we would like to reiterate in particular our
delegation's understanding that all savings accumulated as
a result of any efficiency measures shall be transferred to
the appropriate Development Account section with the
prior approval of the General Assembly, and that those
savings shall form the maintenance base for that section
in future proposed programme budgets.
We also consider that the resources allocated to this
section should not be utilized to fund activities that are
normally funded through extrabudgetary sources. We
await with interest the proposals to be made soon by the
Secretary-General regarding the future use of already
existing funds for this section.
Finally, allow us to reaffirm that the implementation

on the resolution just adopted.
Mr. Oratmangun (Indonesia): My delegation fully
welcomes the adoption of the resolution on the financing
the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET).
Its adoption is critical for enabling the Mission to conduct
its mandated activities in a timely fashion and fully
reflects the international character of the Organization, in

accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter, as
well as the rules and regulations that govern such missions.
We firmly believe that
it
is the obligation of all
Member States to safeguard the good name, credibility and
capability of the United Nations so as to maintain the
international community's trust in the Organization. It is
critically important that the United Nations, in keeping with
its central characteristic of being representative of all
Member States,
its
activities at the field level.
is enabled to effectively conduct
It is our view that the success or failure of the Mission
will very much depend on the staff of the Mission itself,
and they will represent the Organization itself. Obviously,
if the staff of the Mission conduct their mandated activities
in a neutral and impartial manner, this would be a key
element in maintaining the character of the Organization.
This is even more urgent since most of the activities of the
United Nations in the region are in the conflict area.
43rd plenary meeting
29 October 1999
In this regard, I would like to stress that in order for
the Mission to be successful, it is important that it be well
prepared and well organized, both at Headquarters and in
the field.
As host country for the United Nations Mission in
East Timor, we are fully committed to the success of the
Mission and have not failed to show our cooperation in
this regard. Thus my delegation welcomes the assurances
of the Secretariat that the host country's contribution in
providing the necessary facilities and premises to the
Mission, thereby enabling it to avail itself of significant
savings, will be reflected in the next performance report.
