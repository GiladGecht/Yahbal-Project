Tribute to the memory of His Excellency The
Honourable Roosevelt Douglas, late Prime
Minister of Dominica
The President: It is my sad duty to pay tribute to
the  memory  of  the  late  Prime  Minister  of  Dominica,
His  Excellency  The  Honourable  Roosevelt  Douglas,
who passed away on 1 October 2000.
He  was  a  prominent  political leader  in  Dominica
and had been its Prime Minister since February of this
year. It was only last month that the General Assembly
heard his statements at  the Millennium  Summit  and in
the general debate.
On behalf of the General Assembly, I request the
representative of  Dominica  to  convey our  condolences
to the Government  and  people  of  Dominica  and to the
bereaved  family  of  His  Excellency  The  Honourable
Roosevelt Douglas.
I  invite  representatives  to  stand  and  observe  a
minute  of  silence  in  tribute  to  the  memory  of  His
Excellency The Honourable Roosevelt Douglas.
The members of the General Assembly observed a
minute of silence.
The  President:
I  give 
floor 
the 
representative of Dominica.
to 
the
Douglas,  the  late  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for
Foreign Affairs of the Commonwealth of Dominica. On
behalf  of the  Douglas  family  and  the  Government  and
people  of  Dominica,  I  would  also  like  to  use  this
opportunity to express our sincere thanks to those from
whom  we  have  received  words  of  comfort  and
expressions of sympathy at this moment of sadness for
all Dominicans.
Honourable  Roosevelt  Douglas  was  born 
in
Portsmouth,  Dominica,  on  15  October  1941.  The
second  son  of  a  relatively  prosperous  family,  “Rosie”,
as  he  was  popularly  known  throughout  the  Caribbean,
demonstrated at an early age a willingness to assist the
less  fortunate,  and  that  caring  and  generous  spirit
shaped his character and outlook.
After 
secondary 
completing  his 
education,
Honourable  Roosevelt  Douglas  left  Dominica  in  1961
to  pursue  studies  in  agriculture  at  the  University  of
Guelph  in  Canada.  Upon  graduation  from  Guelph,  the
young Roosevelt Douglas changed course and courses,
proceeding 
to  study  political  science  at  McGill
University.  That  he  should  choose  politics  over
agriculture  is  not  surprising;  both  his  father  and  his
older brother, Michael,  had been  successful  politicians
and  Members  of  Parliament  before  him.  But  his
political  journey  began  in  inauspicious  circumstances,
and  he  was  destined  to  go  down  a  political  path  not
travelled by either his father or brother.
Mr.  Richards  (Dominica):  Mr.  President,  I  wish
to  thank  you  and  the  members  of  your  staff  for
arranging  this  tribute  to  The  Honourable  Roosevelt
The  late  Honourable  Roosevelt  Douglas  was
pursuing doctoral studies in political  science  when  the
turbulent  events  of  the  1960s  and  his  life  experiences

stand  against  racism  and 
the  discrimination  and
indignity  associated  with  it.  As  a  consequence,  his
studies  came  to  an  end.  On  his  return  to  Dominica  in

The  late  Roosevelt  Douglas  was  elected  to  the
Dominica  Parliament  for  the  first  time  in  1985.  From
1982  until  his  death,  he  was  the  leader  of  the  Labour
Party of Dominica, and from 1996 to 1999 he served as
Leader of the Opposition in Parliament. On 4 February
2000  Honourable  Roosevelt  Douglas  was  sworn  in  as
the  fifth  Prime  Minister  of  the  Commonwealth  of
Dominica.
Throughout  his  adult  life  Roosevelt  Douglas  had
a  singular  passionate  commitment  to  the  struggle  for
the  liberation  of  black  people  everywhere  and  for  the
economic  and  political  empowerment  of  the  poor  and
disadvantaged.  Driven  by  that  commitment  and  his
concern  for  social  and  economic  justice,  he  became
involved  in  the  1980s  and  1990s  in  international
solidarity  work  in  various  parts  of  the  world.  In
southern  Africa,  in  particular,  he  played  an  important
role  in  support  of  the  South  West  Africa  People’s
Organization  (SWAPO)  and 
the  African  National
Congress  (ANC)  in  the  struggle  against  apartheid.
During  that  period  he  also  established  significant
relationships  with 
and
Governments  in  Europe.  In  the  course  of  his  brief
stewardship  as  Prime  Minister  of  Dominica,  he
promoted  those  relationships  as  building  blocks  of  a
new  cooperative  effort  to  develop  relationships  with
Europe.
other  Labour 
Parties 
Never a politician in the conventional mould, the
late Prime Minister energized the political debate in his
own  country  and  in  the  Caribbean  by  frequently
expressing  views  and  advocating  positions  considered
politically  unwise  by  some.  In  his  quest  for  dignity,
respect  and  better  economic  conditions  for  the  less
privileged, the Prime Minister would not allow himself
to be distracted by criticism at home or abroad.
Not  everyone  shared  his  vision  of  a  humane  and
just  society  and  the  mechanisms  for  achieving  that
goal.  But,  if  the  late  Prime  Minister  were  to  speak  to
this  Assembly  today,  I  think  he  would  feel  very
comfortable  with the following quotation  from  George
Bernard Shaw:
2
“You see things; and you say, ‘Why?’ But I dream
things that never were; and I say, ‘Why not?’”
The  legacy  of  Roosevelt  Bernard  Douglas  is  that  he
dared  to  ask  “why  not”,  and  in  so  doing  touched  in  a
fundamental  way 
in
Dominica, the Caribbean and elsewhere.

Agenda item 15
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs
(a) Election of five non-permanent members of the
Security Council
The President:  The  General  Assembly  will  now
proceed to the election of five non-permanent members
of  the  Security  Council  to  replace  those  members
whose term of office expires on 31 December 2000.
The  five  outgoing  non-permanent  members  are
the  following:  Argentina,  Canada,  Malaysia,  Namibia
and  the  Netherlands.  Those  five  States  cannot  be  re-
elected and therefore their names should not appear on
the ballot papers.
Apart  from  the  five  permanent  members,  the
Security  Council  will  include  in  2001  the  following
States:  Bangladesh, 
Jamaica,  Mali,  Tunisia  and
A/55/PV.32
Ukraine.  The  names  of  those  States,  therefore,  should
also not appear on the ballot papers.
Of  the  five  non-permanent  members  which  will
remain  in  office  in  2001,  three  are  from  Africa  and
Asia, one is from Eastern Europe and one is from Latin
America and the Caribbean.
Consequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General
Assembly  resolution  1991  A  (XVIII)  of  17  December
1963,  the  five  non-permanent  members  should  be
elected  according  to  the  following  pattern:  two  from
Africa  and  Asia,  one  from  Latin  America  and  the
Caribbean  and two  from  among the  Western  European
and other States. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.
In  accordance  with  established  practice,  there  is
an understanding to the effect that, of the two States to
be  elected  from  Africa  and  Asia,  one  should  be  from
Africa and one from Asia.
I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  those
candidates,  their  number  not  exceeding  the  number  of
seats  to  be  filled,  who  receive  the  greatest  number  of
votes and a two-thirds majority of members present and
voting will be declared elected.
In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there
will  be  a  restricted  ballot  limited  to  those  candidates
which have obtained an equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to
that procedure?
It was so decided.
The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the
rules of procedure, the election shall be held by  secret
ballot and there shall be no nominations.

Regarding  candidatures  for  the  two  vacant  seats

communications  have  been  circulated  as  official
documents  of 
the  General  Assembly:  documents
A/55/457  and  A/55/463.  In  addition,  in  document
A/55/464,  the  Permanent  Representative  of  Mauritius
presents the candidature of Mauritius as well.

from  among  the  Western  European  and  Other  States,

In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of
procedure,  we  shall  proceed  now  to  the  election  by
secret ballot.
Before we begin the voting process, I should like
to remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules
