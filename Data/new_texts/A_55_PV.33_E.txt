The meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.
Agenda item 15 (continued)
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs
(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic
and Social Council
The  President:  This  morning, 
the  General
Assembly  will  proceed  to  the  election  of  18  members
of  the  Economic  and  Social  Council  to  replace  those
members whose term of office expires on 31 December
2000.
The  18  outgoing  members  are  Algeria,  Belarus,
Belgium,  Brazil,  Colombia,  the  Comoros,  India,  Italy,
Lesotho,  Mauritius,  New  Zealand,  Oman,  Pakistan,
Poland, Saint Lucia, Sierra Leone, the United States of
America and Viet Nam.
As  of  1  January  2001,  the  following  States  will
continue  to  be  represented  on  the  Economic  and  Social
Council:  Angola,  Austria,  Bahrain,  Benin,  Bolivia,
Bulgaria,  Burkina  Faso,  Cameroon,  Canada,  China,
Costa  Rica,  Croatia,  Cuba,  the  Czech  Republic,  the
Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo,  Denmark,  Fiji,
France,  Germany,  Greece,  Guinea-Bissau,  Honduras,
Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, Norway, Portugal,
the  Russian  Federation,  Rwanda,  Saudi  Arabia,
Suriname,  the  Syrian  Arab  Republic,  the  Sudan,  the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and  Venezuela.  The  names  of  these  36  States  should
therefore not appear on the ballots.
In  accordance  with  paragraph  4  of  General
Assembly  resolution  2847  (XXVI)  of  20  December
1971, and taking into account the number of States that
will  remain  members  of  the  Council  after  1  January
2001,  the  18  members  should  be  elected  as  follows:
five  from  African  States,  four  from  Asian  States,  two
from  Eastern  European  States, 
three  from  Latin
American and Caribbean States and four from Western
European  and  other  States.  The  ballot  papers  reflect
this pattern.
I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  those
candidates,  their  number  not  exceeding  the  number  of
seats  to  be  filled,  receiving  the  greatest  number  of
votes  and  a  two-thirds  majority  of  those  present  and
voting will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote
for  a  remaining  seat,  there  will  be  a  restricted  ballot
limited to those candidates that have obtained an equal
number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to
that procedure?
It was so decided.
The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the
rules of procedure, the election shall be held by  secret
ballot, and there shall be no nominations.

For the four vacant seats from among the Western

In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of
procedure,  we  shall  now  proceed  to  the  election  by
secret ballot.
Before we begin the voting process, I should like
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the
rules  of  procedure  of 
the  General  Assembly,  no
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting.
I  should  like  to  seek  the  usual  cooperation  of
representatives  during  the  time  of  the  conduct  of  the
election.  As  members  are  all  aware,  once  the  voting
begins, all campaigning should cease on the main floor
of the General Assembly Hall. This means in particular
that, until the election is completed, no more campaign
material  can  be  distributed  inside  the  Hall  and  all
representatives are requested to remain at their seats.
Ballot papers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E”
will now be distributed. I request representatives to use
only  those  ballot  papers  and  to  write  on  them  the
names of the States for which they wish to vote.
A  ballot  paper  containing  more  names  from  the
relevant region than the number of seats assigned to  it
will be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a
ballot  paper  that  do  not  belong  to  that  region  will  not
be counted at all.
At the invitation of the President, Ms. Holliday
(Australia), Mr. Jara (Chile), Ms. Nangula
(Namibia), Mr. Priputen (Slovakia) and
Ms. Upakarnitikaset (Thailand) acted as tellers.
