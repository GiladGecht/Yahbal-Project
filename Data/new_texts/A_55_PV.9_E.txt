obliged now to suspend the meeting.

at 11.20 a.m.

The  President:  In  paragraph  13,  the  General
Committee recommends to the Assembly that the First
Committee  should  complete 
its  work  by  Friday,
3 November;  the  Special  Political  and  Decolonization
(Fourth)  Committee  by  Thursday,  9  November;  the
Third  Committee  by  Friday,  10  November;  the  Sixth
Committee by Tuesday, 21 November; and the  Second
and Fifth Committees by Friday, 1 December 2000.
May  I  take  it  that  the  Assembly  approves  the
recommendation?
It was so decided.
The  President:  Next,  we  turn  to  section  II.D,
concerning the schedule of meetings.
In  paragraph  14, 
the  General  Committee
recommends  to  the  General  Assembly  that  morning
meetings  should  start  at  10  a.m.  promptly  for  all
plenary  meetings 
the  Main
Committees.
and  meetings  of 
May  I  take  it  that  the  Assembly  approves  that
recommendation?
It was so decided.
The President: I should like to remind  members
that,  for  the  afternoon  meetings,  I  intend  to  begin
promptly at 3 p.m.
In  the  same  paragraph,  the  General  Committee
recommends  to  the  Assembly  that,  as  a  cost-saving
measure,  plenary  meetings  and  meetings  of  the  Main
Committees,  including  informals,  be  adjourned  by  6
p.m.  and  that  no  meetings  be  held  on  weekends,  with
the  exception  of  the  general  debate.  The  Committee
further  recommends  that 
this  cost-saving  measure
should  also  apply,  for  the  remainder  of  2000,  to
meetings  on  the  calendar  of  conferences  and  meetings
of the United Nations.
May  I  take  it  that  the  Assembly  approves  that
recommendation?
It was so decided.
The  President:  In  paragraph  15,  the  General
Committee recommends that, in order to avoid the late
start  of  meetings,  the  General  Assembly  should  waive
the requirement of the presence of at least one third of
the  members  to  declare  a  plenary  meeting  open  and
permit the debate to proceed, and of at least one quarter
of  the  members  to  declare  a  meeting  of  a  Main
Committee open and permit the debate to proceed.
May  I  take  it  that  the  Assembly  approves  that
recommendation?
It was so decided.
The  President:  In  that  connection,  I  should  like
to  endorse  strongly  the  practical  suggestion  made  at
previous  sessions,  for  each  delegation  to  designate
someone 
to  be  present  at  the  scheduled  time.  I
genuinely hope that all delegations will cooperate.
In  paragraph  16, 
the  General  Committee
recommends  to  the  General Assembly that  delegations
should  be  reminded  of  the  utmost  importance  of
punctuality.
May  I  take  it  that  the  Assembly  approves  that
recommendation?
It was so decided.
The  President:  In  that  regard,  I  should  like  to
impress  upon  members  that  a  10-minute  delay  of  the
start of every meeting at Headquarters would result in a
waste  of  approximately  $800,000  a  year.  I  therefore
sincerely  hope  that all  delegations  will  make  a  special
effort  to  cooperate  in  this  regard,  so  that  all  meetings
can start promptly at 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.
In section II.E, concerning the general debate, the
General  Committee  took  note  of  the  fact  that  the
general  debate  would  be  held  from  Tuesday,  12
September,  to  Saturday,  16  September  2000,  and  from
Monday, 18 September, to Friday, 22 September 2000.

In  paragraph  18, 
May  I  take  it  that  the  Assembly  takes  note  of
paragraph 18?
It was so decided.
The  President:  In  that  regard,  I  should  like  to
remind  delegations  of  the  request  by  the  Secretariat
that speakers deliver their statements at a normal speed
within  the  given  time-frame  at  all  times  to  allow  for
proper interpretation.
In paragraph 19, the General Committee endorsed
the suggestion of the Secretary-General  that  the  list of
speakers  in  the  general  debate  be  closed  on  Thursday,
14 September, at 6 p.m.
A/55/PV.9
In  view  of  the  very  large  number  of  speakers
already  inscribed  on  the  list,  I  urge  representatives  to
take the floor in the order in which they appear on the
list  of  speakers  in  the  general  debate.  Those  who  are
unable to speak at the scheduled time will be put at the
end of the list for that meeting.

In  paragraph  20,  the  General  Committee  draws
the  Assembly’s  attention  to  a  previous  decision  of  the

May  I  take  it  that  the  Assembly  approves  that

The  President:  The  General  Committee  also
recommends  to  the  Assembly  that,  after  delivering
their statements, speakers in the  general  debate  should
leave  the  General  Assembly  Hall  through  room  GA-
200,  located  behind  the  podium,  before  returning  to
their seats.
May  I  take  it  that  the  Assembly  also  approves
that recommendation?
It was so decided.
The President: We shall now turn to section II.F.
May  I  take  it  that  the  Assembly  takes  note  of  the
provisions concerning explanations of vote and right of
reply contained in paragraph 21?

The President: May I further take it that it is the
wish  of  the  General  Assembly  to  limit  points  of  order
to five minutes, as recommended in paragraph 22?
It was so decided.
The  President:  In  paragraph  23,  in  connection
with  the  length  of  statements,  the  General  Committee
draws 
to
paragraph 22 of the annex to resolution 51/241,  which
provides that outside the general debate, there shall be
a  15-minute  time  limit  in  plenary  meetings  and  in  the

states  that  since  in  plenary  meetings  the  length  of
statements  in  debates  other  than  the  general  debate
averages  eight  minutes,  the  General  Assembly  may
wish  to  review 
the  recommendation  contained  in
paragraph 22 of the annex to resolution 51/241.
May  I  take  it  that  the  General  Assembly  takes
note  of  paragraph  24  of  the  report  of  the  General
Committee?

The  President:  May  I  take  it  that  the  Assembly
takes  note  of  the  provisions  regarding  the  length  of
statements contained in paragraph 25?
It was so decided.
The President: Section II.G deals with records of
meetings.
In  paragraph  26,  the  General  Committee  took
note  of  the  fact  that  verbatim  records  would  be
provided  during  the  fifty-fifth  session  for  the  plenary
meetings of the General Assembly and for the meetings
of  the  First  Committee,  and  that  summary  records
would  be  provided  for  the  meetings  of  the  General
Committee  and  the  other  Main  Committees  of  the
Assembly.
May  I  take  it  that  the  Assembly  approves  the
recommendation contained in paragraph 26 concerning
transcriptions of the debates of some of the meetings of
the  Special  Political  and  Decolonization  Committee
(Fourth Committee)?
It was so decided.
The  President:  May  I  take  it  that  the  Assembly

maintained for the fifty-fifth session?

December  1999,  which  emphasize  that  documentation

subparagraph  13 (d)  of  decision  34/401,  the  General

fact  that  the  preparation  of  a  statement  of  programme

The Secretary-General thus considers it desirable

The President: We now turn to section III of the
report  of  the  General  Committee,  which  contains
observations  on  the  organization  of  future  sessions  of
the  General  Assembly.  In  paragraph  45,  the  General
Committee  draws 
the  General
Assembly  to  paragraph  17  of  the  annex  to  resolution
51/241, which states, inter alia, that the
the  attention  of 
to 
the  Assembly 
the  report  of 
“plenary meetings of the General Assembly shall
be  formally  opened  every  year  on  the  first
Tuesday following 1 September”.
In that connection, the Committee also draws the
the
attention  of 
Secretary-General  on  the  implementation  of  resolution
51/241  (A/52/855),  in  particular  to  paragraphs  16  and
17, which highlight the subsequent action that needs to
be  taken  and  the  difficulty  that  will  be  encountered  in
implementing that provision. As stated in paragraph 17
of  the  Secretary-General’s  report,  in  recent  years  the
closing  date  has  been  the  Monday  before  the  opening
of  the  next  session.  Were  the  General  Assembly  to
retain this practice, the closing date would consistently
fall  on  an  official  holiday  of  the  Organization,  for
which financial and other implications  may need to be
considered.  Paragraph  17  of  that  report  further  states
that  the  General  Assembly  may  wish  to  decide  on  a
closing  date  for  future  sessions  that  will  fall  on  a
working day.
In  paragraph  46,  the  General  Committee,  noting
the  ad  hoc  decisions  that  had  to  be  taken  by  the
5
A/55/PV.9
General  Assembly  concerning 
the  opening  and/or
closing  dates  of  the  fifty-second,  fifty-third,  fifty-
fourth  and  fifty-fifth  sessions,  recommends  to  the
Assembly  that  it  address,  during  its  fifty-fifth  session,
the question of the opening and closing dates of future
regular  sessions  with  a  view  to  deciding  on  a  formula
to  determine  the  opening  and  closing  dates  of  future
regular sessions.
In  paragraph  47,  the  General  Committee,  taking
into  account  the  opening  date  of  the  regular  sessions,
also  recommends  to  the  Assembly  a  review  of  the
question of the  mandatory deadline  for the  submission
to  the  Fifth  Committee  of  all  draft  resolutions  having
programme budget implications.

and 
It was so decided.
The President: We now turn to section IV of the
report  of  the  General  Committee,  relating  to  the
adoption of the agenda. It starts at paragraph 48.
I  would  first  recall  rule  23  of  the  rules  of
procedure, which provides that:
“Debate  on  the  inclusion  of  an  item  in  the
agenda,  when  that  item  has  been  recommended
for inclusion by the  General  Committee,  shall  be
limited  to  three  speakers  in  favour  of,  and  three
against, the inclusion”.
I should like to stress that at this time we are not
discussing the substance of any item.
With regard to paragraph 49,  may I consider that
it  is  the  wish  of  the  Assembly  to  direct  its  Main
Committees  to  review  their  agendas  with  a  view  to
streamlining their programme of work, as suggested in
that paragraph?
I see no objection.
It was so decided.

the Assembly to give careful thought to the suggestion

In  paragraph  51,

recommends  that  the  consideration  of  item  59  of  the

The  President:  In  paragraph  52,  the  General
Committee  recommends  that  the  consideration  of  item
93  of  the  draft  agenda,  “Question  of  the  Malagasy
islands  of  Glorieuses,  Juan  de  Nova,  Europa  and
Bassas  da  India”,  should  be  deferred  to  the  fifty-sixth
session  and  that  the  item  should  be  included  in  the
provisional agenda of that session.
May  I  take  it  that  the  Assembly  approves  that
recommendation?
It was so decided.

with items 171, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181
and  187  of  the  draft  agenda,  the  General  Committee
recommends the inclusion in the agenda of the current
session  of  one  single 
item,  entitled  “Scale  of
assessments  for  the  apportionment  of  the  expenses  of
United Nations peacekeeping operations”.
May  I  take  it  that  the  Assembly  approves  that
recommendation?

with item 173 of the draft agenda, “Observer status for
the  Inter-American  Development  Bank  in  the  General
Assembly”,  the  General  Committee  recommends  its
inclusion in the agenda of the current session.
May  I  take  it  that  the  Assembly  approves  that
recommendation?
It was so decided.
The  President:  In  paragraph  56,  in  connection
with item 182 of the draft agenda, “Observer status for
the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral
Assistance  in  the  General  Assembly”,  the  General
Committee  recommends  its  inclusion  in  the  agenda  of
the current session.
May  I  take  it  that  the  Assembly  approves  that
recommendation?
It was so decided.
The  President:  In  respect  of  paragraph  57,  the
General  Committee  decided  not  to  recommend  the
inclusion of item 183.

I  should  now  like  to  draw  the  attention  of
representatives to a matter concerning the participation
of Palestine, in its capacity as observer, in the sessions
and  work  of  the  General  Assembly.  Members  will
recall  resolution  52/250  of  7  July  1998  and  its  annex,
as well as a note by the Secretary-General contained in
document  A/52/1002

General’s  understanding  of  the  implementation  of  the
modalities annexed to the resolution.
that  outlines 
I should like to draw the  Assembly’s attention in
particular  to  paragraph  6  of  the  annex  to  resolution
52/250, which reads as follows:
“The  right  to  make  interventions,  with  a
precursory  explanation  or  the  recall  of  relevant
General  Assembly  resolutions  being  made  only
once by the President of the General Assembly at
the start of each session of the Assembly”.
Accordingly,  for  the  fifty-fifth  session  of  the
General  Assembly,  the  observer  of  Palestine  will
therefore  participate 
the  General
Assembly  in  accordance  with  resolution  3237  (XXIX)
of  22  November  1974,  resolution  43/177  of  15
December  1988  and  resolution  52/250  of  7  July  1998,
with no further need for a precursory explanation prior
to any intervention by Palestine in this session.
