The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.
Agenda item 15
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs
(a) Election of five non-permanent members of the
Security Council
The  President:  The  General  Assembly  will  now
proceed to the election of five non-permanent members
of  the  Security  Council  to  replace  those  members
whose term of office expires on 31 December 2001.
The  five  outgoing  non-permanent  members  are
the following: Bangladesh, Jamaica, Mali, Tunisia and
Ukraine.  Those  five  States  cannot  be  re-elected,  and
therefore  their  names  should  not  appear  on  the  ballot
papers.
Apart  from  the  five  permanent  members,  the
Security  Council  will  include  in  2002  the  following
States:  Colombia,  Ireland,  Mauritius,  Norway  and
Singapore. The names of those States, therefore, should
also not appear on the ballot papers.
Of  the  five  non-permanent  members  which  will
remain in office in 2002, two are from Africa and Asia,
one is from Latin America and the Caribbean and two
are from Western European and other States.
Consequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General
Assembly  resolution  1991  A  (XVIII)  of  17  December
1963,  the  five  non-permanent  members  should  be
elected  according  to  the  following  pattern:  three  from
Africa  and  Asia,  one  from  Eastern  Europe  and  one
from  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean.  The  ballot
papers reflect that pattern.
In  accordance  with  established  practice,  there  is
an  understanding  to  the  effect  that,  of  the  three  States
to be elected from Africa and Asia, two should be from
Africa and one from Asia.
I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  those
candidates,  their  number  not  exceeding  the  number  of
seats to be filled, which receive the greatest number of
votes and a two-thirds majority of members present and
voting will be declared elected.
In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there
will  be  a  restricted  ballot  limited  to  those  candidates
which have obtained an equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to
that procedure?
It was so decided.
The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the
rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret
ballot and there shall be no nominations.
Regarding candidatures, I have been informed by
the  Chairmen  of  the  relevant  regional  groups  of  the
following.
For  the  three  vacant  seats  from  among  the
African  and  Asian  States,  there  are  three  endorsed
candidates:  Cameroon,  Guinea  and  the  Syrian  Arab
Republic.
This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of
speeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original
languages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature
of a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room
C-178. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.

A/56/PV.23
For  the  Eastern  European  States,  there  are  two
candidates for one vacant seat: Belarus and Bulgaria.
As for the Latin American and Caribbean States,
there  are  also  two  candidates  for  one  vacant  seat:  the
Dominican Republic and Mexico.
In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of
procedure,  we  shall  proceed  now  to  the  election  by
secret ballot.
Before we begin the voting process, I should like
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting.
I  should  like  to  seek  the  usual  cooperation  of
representatives  during  the  conduct  of  the  election.  I
remind  representatives  that  during  the  voting  process
all campaigning should cease in the General Assembly
Hall.  That  means,  in  particular,  that  once  the  meeting
has  begun,  no  more  campaign  material  may  be
distributed inside the Hall. All representatives are also
requested  to  remain  in  their  seats  so  that  the  voting
process  can  proceed  in  an  orderly  manner.  I  thank
members for their cooperation.
We shall now begin the voting process.
Ballot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” will now
be distributed.
I  request  representatives  to  use  only  those  ballot
papers that have been distributed and to write on them
the  names  of  the  five  States  for  which  they  wish  to
vote.
A  ballot  paper  containing  more  names  from  the
relevant region than the number of seats assigned to it
will be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a
ballot  paper  that  do  not  belong  to  that  region  will  not
be counted.
At  the  invitation  of  the  President,  Ms.  Holliday
(Australia),  Mr.  Unaibayev 
(Kazakhstan),
Mr.  Cardy  (South  Africa)  and  Ms.  Ramoutar
(Trinidad and Tobago) acted as tellers.

they wish to vote.
Ballot papers marked “C” will be declared invalid

contain the names of more than one State.
