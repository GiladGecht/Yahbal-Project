Adoption of the agenda and organization of work
Elections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and
other elections
(a) Election of the members of the International
Law Commission
Documentation for the election of the members
of the International Law Commission
The  President:  As  was  announced  at  the  30th
plenary meeting on Monday, 22 October 2001, I should
like to consult the Assembly on a matter regarding the
election  of  members  of 
International  Law
Commission,  which  will  be  held  on  Wednesday,  7
November 2001.
the 
On  that  day,  the  Assembly  will  proceed  to  the
election  of  34  members  of  the  Commission,  whose
terms of office are to commence on 1 January 2002. It
should  be  recalled  that,  in  accordance  with  the  statute
of  the  International  Law  Commission,  the  Secretary-
General communicated to the Governments of Member
States,  in  document  A/56/117  and  Corr.1,  the  list  of
candidates  submitted  within  the  required  time  for  the
submission of nominations — that is, by 1 June 2001.
The  statements  of  qualifications  of  the  candidates  are
contained in document A/56/124.
Subsequent  to  that  date,  the  Secretary-General
received additional information concerning candidates,
new  candidatures  as  well  as  a  withdrawal.  The  names
of the new candidates and additional information are to
be  found  in  documents  A/56/117/Add.1  and  Add.2,  as
well as A/56/124/Add.1.
Under these circumstances, it is necessary for the
General Assembly to take a decision as to whether the
new  candidatures  should  be  accepted  in  spite  of  the
submission  of  their  names  subsequent  to  the  deadline
and  whether 
into  a
consolidated list of candidates. It has been the practice
of  the  Assembly  to  incorporate  such  late  submissions
into a consolidated list.
they  should  be 
incorporated 
If I hear no objection, I shall take it that it is the
wish of the General Assembly to request the Secretary-
General to issue such a consolidated list of candidates.
It was so decided.
The  President:  The 
consolidated 
list  of
candidates will be issued under the symbol A/56/486.
I call on the representative of Sudan on a point of
order.
(Sudan): 
I  apologize 
Mr.  Rahmtalla
for
interrupting the proceedings. However, with respect to
the  information  that  was  given  earlier  concerning  the
elections to the International Law Commission, I would
like to confirm that Africa will be allocated nine seats
this  time.  I  do  so  because,  in  some  of  the  texts  of  the
Secretary-General,  it  is  not  really  clear  as  to  whether

Africa has eight or nine seats. But it is clear to us that
Africa  should  have  nine  seats.  There  is  one  seat  that
rotates  and  that  additional  seat,  this  time,  will  be  for
Africa.  This  means  accordingly  that  Africa  will  have
nine seats this time.
The  President:  The  General  Assembly  will  take
note of the statement of the representative of Sudan.
Agenda item 15
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs
(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic
and Social Council
Letter from Portugal (A/56/467)
The  President:  As  was  announced  at  its  29th
plenary  meeting  on  22  October  2001,  the  Assembly
will first proceed to a by-election to elect a member of
the  Economic  and  Social  Council,  in  accordance  with
rule 140 of the rules of procedure.
In  this  connection,  I  should  like  to  draw  the
attention  of  members 
to  document  A/56/467,
containing  a  letter  dated  11  October  2001  from  the
Permanent  Representative  of  Portugal  to  the  United
Nations. In his letter, the Permanent Representative of
Portugal  announces 
to
relinquish its seat on the Economic and Social Council
for the year 2002, in favour of Spain.
that  Portugal  would 
like 
As  a  result,  a  vacancy  will  occur  and  a  new
member must therefore be elected to fill the unexpired
term of office of Portugal for one year, commencing on
1 January 2002.
In  accordance  with  paragraph  4  of  General
Assembly  resolution  2847  (XXVI)  of  20  December
1971,  and  taking  into  account  that  the  vacancy  will
occur  from  among  the  Western  European  and  other
States,  the  new  member  should  therefore  be  elected
from that region.
I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  the
candidate  which  receives  a  two-thirds  majority  of  the
votes  of  members  present  and  voting  will  be  declared
elected. In the case of a tie vote, there will be a special
restricted  ballot  limited  to  those  candidates  that  have
obtained an equal number of votes.

May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to
that procedure?
It was so decided.
The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the
rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret
ballot and there shall be no nominations.
Regarding  the  vacancy,  the  Chairman  of  the
Group  of  Western  European  and  other  States  for  the
month of October has informed the Secretariat that the
Group has endorsed Spain.
In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of
procedure,  we  shall  now  proceed  to  the  election  by
secret ballot.
I  should  like  to  inform  members  that,  as  of  1
January  2002,  the  following  States  from  the  Group  of
Western European and other States will be represented
on the Economic and Social Council: Andorra, Austria,
France, Germany, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands and the
United  States  of  America.  The  names  of  those  eight
States should therefore not appear on the ballot.
Before we begin the voting process, I should like
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting.
I  should  like  to  seek  the  usual  cooperation  of
representatives  during  the  time  of  the  conduct  of  the
election.  Please  be  reminded  that,  during  the  voting
process,  all  campaigning  should  cease  in  the  General
Assembly Hall. This means in particular that, once the
election has begun, no more campaign material can be
distributed inside the Hall. All representatives are also
requested  to  remain  at  their  seats  so  that  the  voting
process can proceed in an orderly manner.
We shall now begin the voting process.
Ballot  papers  will  now  be  distributed.  I  request
representatives  to  use  only  those  ballot  papers  and  to
write on them the name of the one State for which they
wish to vote. A ballot paper containing more than one
name  from  the  region  will  be  declared  invalid.  The
name of a Member State on a ballot paper that does not
belong to that region will not be counted at all.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Magaryan
(Armenia), Mr. Moushoutas (Cyprus),
Ms. Anagnostopoulou (Greece), Miss Marston
(Jamaica) and Ms. Rajaonarivelo (Madagascar)
acted as tellers.
A vote was taken by secret ballot.
The meeting was suspended at 10.30 a.m. and
resumed at 10.45 a.m.

Having obtained the required two-thirds majority,
Spain was elected a member of the Economic and
Social Council for a one-year term beginning
1 January 2002.
The  President:  I  congratulate  Spain,  which  has
been  elected  a  member  of  the  Economic  and  Social
Council.
The  General  Assembly  will  next  turn  to  the
election  of  18  members  of  the  Economic  and  Social
Council to replace those members whose term of office
expires on 31 December 2001.
The  18  outgoing  members  are  Bolivia,  Bulgaria,
Canada,  China,  the  Czech  Republic,  the  Democratic
Republic  of  the  Congo,  Denmark,  Guinea-Bissau,
Honduras,  Indonesia,  Morocco,  Norway,  the  Russian
Federation,  Rwanda,  Saudi  Arabia,  the  Syrian  Arab
Republic,  the  United  Kingdom  of  Great  Britain  and
Northern Ireland and Venezuela.
Members will recall that Portugal relinquished its
seat  on  the  Economic  and  Social  Council  effective
1 January 2002.
As  of  1  January  2002,  the  following  States  will
continue  to  be  represented  on  the  Economic  and  Social
Council: Andorra, Angola, Argentina, Austria, Bahrain,
Benin,  Brazil,  Burkina  Faso,  Cameroon,  Costa  Rica,
Croatia,  Cuba,  Egypt,  Ethiopia,  Fiji,  France,  Georgia,

Malta,  Mexico,  Nepal, 
the  Netherlands,  Nigeria,
Pakistan, Peru, the Republic of Korea, Romania, South
Africa,  Spain,  the  Sudan,  Suriname,  Uganda  and  the
United States of America. The names of those 36 States
should therefore not appear on the ballots.
In  accordance  with  paragraph  4  of  General
Assembly  resolution  2847  (XXVI)  of  20  December
1971, and taking into account the number of States that
will  remain  members  of  the  Council  after  1  January
2002,  the  18  members  should  be  elected  as  follows:
four from African States, four from Asian States, three
from  Eastern  European  States, 
three  from  Latin
American and Caribbean States and four from Western
European  and  other  States.  The  ballot  papers  reflect
that pattern.
I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  those
candidates,  their  number  not  exceeding  the  number  of
seats  to  be  filled,  receiving  the  greatest  number  of
votes and a two-thirds majority of members present and
voting will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote
for  a  remaining  seat,  there  will  be  a  restricted  ballot
limited to those candidates that have obtained an equal
number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to
that procedure?
It was so decided.

rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret
ballot, and there shall be no nominations.

We shall now begin the voting process.
Ballot papers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E”
will now be distributed. I request representatives to use
only  those  ballot  papers  and  to  write  on  them  the
names of the States for which they wish to vote.
A  ballot  paper  containing  more  names  from  the
relevant region than the number of seats assigned to it
will be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a
ballot  paper  that  do  not  belong  to  that  region  will  not
be counted at all.
