In this connection, the Assembly now has before
it  the  note  by  the  Secretary-General  contained  in
document  A/56/486  of  30  October  2001  and  Corr.1,
which consolidates in alphabetical order the candidates
nominated  by  Governments  of  States  Members  of  the
United  Nations  for  election  to  the  International  Law
Commission. There is a total of 45 candidates eligible
in this election.
The  notes  by  the  Secretary-General  concerning
the  statements  of  qualifications  of  candidates  are
contained in document A/56/124 and Add.1.
I  should  like  to  recall  for  members  that,  in
accordance with the statute, the persons to be elected to
the International Law Commission should individually
possess  the  qualifications  required.  They  should  be
“persons  of  recognized  competence  in  international
law”. The statute also provides that in the Commission
as  a  whole,  representation  of  the  main  forms  of
civilization  and  of  the  principal  legal  systems  of  the
world should be assured.
Pursuant  to  paragraph  3  of  General  Assembly
resolution  36/39  of  18  November  1981, 
the  34
members  should  be  elected  as  follows:  nine  nationals
from African States, eight nationals from Asian States,
three  nationals  from  Eastern  European  States,  six
nationals  from  Latin  American  and  Caribbean  States,
and  eight  nationals  from  Western  European  and  other
States. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.
I should like to inform members that the number
of those candidates, not exceeding the number of seats
to be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and
not  less  than  a  majority  of  the  votes  of  the  Member
States  present  and  voting  shall  be  declared  elected.  In
the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be
a  special  restricted  ballot  limited  to  those  candidates
who have obtained an equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to
that procedure?
It was so decided.
The  Acting  President:  In  accordance  with  rule
92 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly,
the election shall be held by secret ballot.
Before we begin the voting process, I should like
to remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules
of 
no
the  General  Assembly, 
procedure 
of 
2
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a
point of order on the actual conduct of the vote.
Ballot papers marked A, B, C, D and E will now
be distributed. I request the representatives to use only
those  ballot  papers.  Representatives  are  requested  to
place a cross to the left of the names of the candidates
for whom they wish to vote. Representatives may vote
only  for  those  candidates  whose  names  appear  on  the
ballot papers, but for no more than the number of seats
allocated  to  each  region.  A  ballot  paper  containing
more  votes  than  the  number  of  seats  allocated  to  the
relevant region will be declared invalid. Let me repeat:
representatives are requested to place a cross to the left
of the names of the candidates for whom they wish to
vote.  Representatives  may  vote  only 
those
candidates  whose  names  appear  on  the  ballot  papers,
but  for  no  more  than  the  number  of  seats  allocated  to
