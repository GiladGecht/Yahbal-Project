The meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.
Address by Mr. Alfonso Portillo Cabrera, President
of the Republic of Guatemala
The  President:  The  Assembly  will  now  hear  an
address by the President of the Republic of Guatemala.
Mr.  Alfonso  Portillo  Cabrera,  President  of  the
Republic  of  Guatemala,  was  escorted  into  the
General Assembly Hall.
The  President:  On  behalf  of 
the  General
Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United
Nations  His  Excellency  Mr.  Alfonso  Portillo  Cabrera,
President  of  the  Republic  of  Guatemala,  and  to  invite
him to address the Assembly.
President  Portillo  Cabrera  (spoke  in  Spanish):
Let  me  first  condemn  the  monstrous  attack  on  the
people  and  the  Government  of  our  host  country.  In
condemning  it  in  the  strongest  possible  terms,  we
declare ourselves in full solidarity with the people and
the  Government  of  the  United  States,  the  families  of
each and every one of the victims, whatever his or her
nationality, and the residents of this great city of New
York.  We  also  associate  ourselves  unreservedly  with
the  resolutions  adopted  last  month  by  the  Assembly
and  the  Security  Council.  We  will  carry  on  in  our
commitment  to  the  elimination  of  terrorism  in  all  its
forms and manifestations.
Before taking up our Government programme and
the  fulfilment  of  the  Peace  Agreements,  and  our
position on certain of the items on the agenda for this
to 
the  presidency  of 
session,  I  wish  to  warmly  congratulate  you,  Sir,  on
your  election 
the  General
Assembly.  I  have  no  doubt  that  your  well-proven
capabilities  and  your  recognized  wisdom  will  enable
you  to  bring  our  deliberations  to  a  fully  successful
outcome.
I  wish  further  to  join  the  representatives  who
have  taken  the  floor  before  me  in  commending  the
Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Kofi Annan
for  his  wise  leadership.  We  hail  his  well-deserved  re-
election and rejoice at the recognition that both he and
the  Organization  have  received,  through  the  award  of
the Nobel Peace Prize.
the  great  scientific  and 
I come, like many of those gathered here, from a
small  country  that  mirrors  the  grave  problems  facing
today’s  world.  Today  we  still  do  not  enjoy  the  major
benefits  of 
technological
advances,  and  we  still  suffer  from  great  social
inequalities.  Ours  is  a  small  country  that  is  doing  its
best  to  attain  peace  and  democracy  —  a  country  that
believes in the rewards of economic freedom, but also
in  social  justice.  It  is  a  country  that  has  opened  itself
up  to  the  world,  although  the  world  has  perhaps  not
opened  itself  up  reciprocally  in  the  same  way.  It  is  a
country  that  works  and  produces  by  making  great
efforts  but  that,  in  the  present  circumstances,  is
receiving less and less for those efforts.
In  this  context,  our  contribution  to  world  peace
and  democracy  is  diminished  to  the  same  extent  that
inequality,  social  injustice  and  poverty  imperil  our
peace and our democracy.

Today 
is 
terrorism 
the  struggle  against 
the
struggle  against  inequality  in  international  economic
relations; it is the struggle against ignorance, injustice,
discrimination, 
intolerance,  exclusion  and  poverty.
There  will  be  no  peace  if  we  do  not  eradicate  these
scourges.  A  peace  that  goes  hand  in  hand  with
inequality, poverty and injustice is a bad peace. And let
us not forget that a bad peace is worse than war.
We  are  making  strenuous  efforts  to  advance  in
implementing  our  own  Peace  Agreements,  which
coincide  with  our  Government  programme.  The  time
that  has  elapsed  since  I  addressed  the  Millennium
Summit  has  witnessed  intensive  activities.  I  can  point
to  significant  progress,  but  I  must  also  admit  to  some
setbacks,  which  are  due  primarily  to  an  unfavourable
international  environment,  which  has  affected  the
economy in an extremely adverse way. I draw attention
to  this  situation,  because  full  compliance  with  the
commitments  contained 
the  Peace  Agreements
would  be  far  easier  in  a  context  of  economic  growth
than in the framework of serious fiscal restrictions and
increasing demands on the Government.
in 
On  a  different  matter,  I  would  like  to  comment
briefly on the United Nations presence in Guatemala. I
wish  to  reiterate  how  much  we  appreciate  the  United
Nations  Verification  Mission 
in  Guatemala
(MINUGUA).  We  trust  that  its  mandate  will  be
extended  until  the  end  of  2003  so  that  we  can  in  a
progressive and orderly way transfer its functions both
to  national  institutions  and,  wherever  possible,  to  the
United Nations programmes and agencies.
As 
international 
far  as  our 
relations  are
concerned,  I  would  like  to  mention  the  significant
progress  made  in  the  process  of  finding  a  peaceful
resolution  to  the  historical  dispute  between  ourselves
and  Belize.  In  keeping  with  the  principles  of  peaceful
settlement  of  disputes  between  States,  we  have
confirmed  with  deeds  our  commitment  to  dialogue  as
the  way  of  settling  disputes.  The  commission  of
facilitators  appointed  last  year,  within  the  framework
of  the  regional  organization  to  which  both  States
belong, the Organization of American States, will soon
submit  its  report.  Its  fundamental  aim  is  to  work  out
and  prepare  courses  of  action  to  make  progress  in
resolving the dispute.
We 
reiterate  our 
for  Central
American  integration  and  our  commitment  to  the  rest
of Latin America and the Caribbean. Our Government
firm  support 
2
has  supported  major  initiatives  in  the  area  of  regional
and  subregional  integration,  and  is  working  hard  to
overcome  problems  left  over  from  age-old  border
disputes in Central America.
As to our position on other international conflicts,
we voice the hope that the differences or divisions that
persist  between  fraternal  peoples  in  the  Middle  East,
Asia  and  Africa  will  yield  to  resolution  peacefully
through dialogue. I also wish to take this opportunity to
reiterate  before  this  Assembly  our  concern  over  the
situation  of  the  23  million  citizens  of  the  Republic  of
China on Taiwan, whose aspiration to be represented in
international  organizations  has  not  yet  been  fully
satisfied.  The  Central  American  countries  in  general,
and Guatemala in particular, believe they could indeed
make a positive contribution to peace and democracy in
the world.
I  would  now  like  to  comment  briefly  on  our
views  regarding  the  principal  issues  with  which  this
Assembly will have to deal at the current session. First,
I reiterate our full support for the United Nations as the
supreme  expression  of  multilateralism.  We  are
convinced  that  the  United  Nations  will  have  a  crucial
role  to  play  in  the  twenty-first  century.  It  is  our  view
that the Millennium Declaration that our heads of State
and  Government  issued  a  year  ago  offers  the  right
agenda for our priorities and for the steps to be taken to
attain the goals set.
Second, we agree that it is necessary to adapt the
Organization  to  the  exigencies  of  globalization  and  to
this  post-cold-war  era.  It  is  up  to  us,  the  Member
Governments,  to  further  this  process  of  adaptation  in
various  areas,  such  as  intergovernmental  forums,  the
efficiency and efficacy of the Secretariat, the setting of
priorities  in  shaping  the  programme  of  activities  and
the financial strengthening of the Organization.
Third,  of  the  pending  reforms,  the  one  that  has
received  the  most  attention  is  that  concerning  the
Security  Council.  One  cannot  but  be  frustrated  at  the
limited progress made in this area at previous sessions
of  the  General  Assembly.  Now  more  than  ever  before
we must redouble our efforts to endow that body with
greater  efficacy,  broader  representativity  and  more
transparency  in  its  working  procedures.  To  achieve
these objectives, we advocate, inter alia, an increase in
the  number  of  Council  members,  as  well  as  a  very
sparse use of the veto power. We also believe that now
the  events

Council’s work be monitored by the General Assembly.
that
occurred in this country on 11 September, we reiterate
our  full  and  complete  opposition  to  terrorism,  and  we
will  support  any  collective  action  by  the  international
community to combat this scourge. As a matter of fact,
we  are  already  working  to  comply  with  the  spirit  and
the  letter  of  the  undertakings  embodied  in  Security
Council resolution 1373 (2001), within the parameters
of  a  democratic  society  that  aspires  to  guarantee  the
human rights of its members.
Fifth,  we  advocate  the  strengthening  of  the
General  Assembly,  and  we  congratulate  the  President
of its fifty-fifth session on his initiative to revitalize its
working  methods  and  procedures.  We  trust  that  this
action  will  continue  under  the  current  presidency  and
that  it  will  extend  to  the  wider  task  of  reforming  the
Assembly, in pursuance of the aims of the Millennium
Declaration.
Sixth, we are convinced of the need to strengthen
our collective capacity to prevent and resolve conflicts,
both  between  States  and  at  the  national  level.  We
believe  that  the  report  of  the  Panel  on  United  Nations
Peace  Operations  provides  an  adequate  basis  for
achieving this purpose.
Seventh,  as  regards  general  disarmament,  we
insist  on  the  need  for  progress  towards  the  total
elimination  of  nuclear,  chemical  and  bacteriological
weapons,  the  illicit  trade  in  small  arms  and  light
weapons, and the use of anti-personnel mines and other
explosive  devices.  In  this  connection,  we  support  all
concrete  actions  by  the  United  Nations  to  accomplish
these  aims, 
the
establishment  of  nuclear-weapon-free  zones  in  all
regions  of  the  world.  As  regards  the  control  of  illicit
trade  in  small  arms  and  light  weapons,  we  are  of  the
view that the results of the Conference held last July to
deal  with  this  problem,  while  positive  if  allowance  is
made  for  this  being  the  first  step  taken  at  the  global
level 
the  matter,  are  nevertheless
inadequate.

Ninth,  in  a  world  characterized  by  ever  greater
interdependence, multilateral diplomacy plays a crucial
role  in  the  fight  against  environmental  degradation.
Guatemala, as a party to the main international treaties
relating  to  the  environment,  reiterates  its  commitment
to the maintenance of ecological balance.

Finally,  we  consider  that  the  United  Nations
should  continue  devoting  itself  to  what  we  call  the
great  unfinished  business  of  the  twentieth  century  —
namely,  the  elimination  of  world  poverty.  Together

international level.

Mr.  Hussein  (Ethiopia),  Vice-President,  took  the
Chair.
Given  the  globalization  process  the  world  is
going  through,  we  must  recognize,  as  stated  by  the
great Mexican thinker Carlos Fuentes, that unregulated
globalization  leads  to  more  profound  economic  and
social imbalance. We cannot turn economic policy into
a  mere  balancing  of  accounts  in  which  human  beings
and populations are not taken into consideration. How
can  we  make  demands  on  some  countries  when  those
demands are not made of others in similar conditions?
Civilization is being put to the test. The question
is  how  to  eliminate  the  universal  threat  posed  by
terrorism and at the same time maintain and renew the
ethical,  political,  legal  and  social  bases  for  ensuring
coexistence in a globalized world. The only solution is
to 
freedom,  more
democracy,  more  tolerance  and  more  justice.  In  this
respect,  I  would  like  to  share  with  the  Assembly  the
words  of  a  distinguished  Guatemalan  poet,  Otto  René
Castillo:

“We have suffered in so many places the blows of
the  executioner  and  written  his  name  so  many
times  on  so  little  skin,  that  we  cannot  die,  for
liberty has no death”.
May God bless and protect us.

Foreign Affairs of the State of Kuwait
The  Acting  President  (spoke  in  Arabic):  The
Assembly  will  now  hear  an  address  by  the  Acting
Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the
State of Kuwait.
Sheikh  Sabah  Al-Ahmad  Al-Jaber  Al-Sabah,
Acting  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign
Affairs of the State of Kuwait, was escorted to the
rostrum.
The  Acting  President  (spoke  in  Arabic):  I  have
great  pleasure  in  welcoming  Sheikh  Sabah  Al-Ahmad
Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Acting Prime Minister and Minister
for Foreign Affairs of the State of Kuwait, and inviting
him to address the General Assembly.
Sheikh  Sabah  Al-Ahmad  Al-Jaber  Al-Sabah
(spoke in Arabic): On behalf of the State of Kuwait, it
gives me pleasure to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo,
and his friendly country, the Republic of Korea, on his
election  as  President  of  the  fifty-sixth  session  of  the
General  Assembly.  The  office  he  holds  undoubtedly
carries  enormous  responsibility.  My  delegation  offers
him  all  the  support  and  cooperation  he  needs  to  fulfil
his  mandate.  I  wish  here  to  pay  tribute  to  his
predecessor,  Mr.  Harri  Holkeri,  for  his  efficient
stewardship of the last session of the Assembly.

Many of the questions and challenges facing our
countries nowadays involve implications and risks that
cut across national borders of sovereign countries. It is
little  wonder  that  our  world  has  become  a  smaller
planet  where  geographical  boundaries, 
cultural
diversity, economic status and ethnic multiplicity have
become lesser factors in shielding communities against
global 
token,  have
provided  larger  platforms  for  interaction  with  others.
The fact that the world community is now seized with
fighting terrorism is perhaps yet further compelling and
clear  evidence  of  the  deep  interaction  among  and
complexity  of  States’  interests  and  concerns.  The
strong  condemnation  of  the  heinous  terrorist  acts
committed against the United States of America on 11
September 2001 reflects the international community’s
recognition  that  the  real  target  of  that  assault  is  the
political,  economic  and  social  stability  of  the  world

Kuwait, for its part, has had a long-standing and
firm position of total and unequivocal condemnation of
terrorism,  irrespective  of  its  form  or  manifestation.
Thus,  only  hours  after  the  commission  of  those
criminal  acts,  which  contravene  and  violate  every
religious  concept  and  every  cultural  and  humanitarian
value  system,  the  Government  and  people  of  Kuwait
condemned  them.  I  wish  to  reiterate  here  our  deep
sympathies  and  condolences  to  the  bereaved  families
and  to  the  friendly  people  of  the  United  States  of
America. Let me reaffirm our full backing and support
for  all  the  efforts  and  measures  adopted  by  the
international coalition to destroy the dens and bases of
terrorism  with  a  view  to  stamping  out  its  roots,  to
apprehend the perpetrators of these criminal acts and to
bring  them  to  justice.  In  this  regard,  we  call  for  the
completion  of  work  on  the  development  of  a  rigorous
international  legal  system  with  which  all  countries  of
the world would comply in good faith to eradicate this
evil.
In  compliance  with  Security  Council  resolution
1373  (2001),  Kuwait  has  enacted  specific  measures  to
plug  any  loopholes  that  might  be  abused  in  charitable
fund-raising  activities  and  to  ensure  that  any  charity
asset  is  used  solely  and  exclusively  for  its  original
legitimate purposes. Our competent authorities are now
in  the  process  of  taking  further  enforcement  measures
to ensure universal and strict compliance.
terrorism  with 
At a time when we condemn all acts of terrorism,
we have been truly surprised to hear some voices that
have started to mount intense and relentless campaigns
linking 
Islam.  Those  allegations
represent an obvious mistreatment of and injustice to a
divine faith revealed by God Almighty to humankind to
ensure mercy and compassion on this planet. Islam is a
faith that advocates peace, calls for tolerance, promotes
amity and renounces bigotry and extremism. Suffice it
to cite one verse from The Holy Koran:
“Invite (all) to the Way
Of thy Lord with wisdom
And beautiful preaching” (The Holy Koran,
XVI:125)
Therefore, we really cannot accept these tendencies in
the domestic or international mass media, regardless of
any  excuse  or  pretext.  Indeed,  it  is  our  common
responsibility  to  challenge  such  pernicious  campaigns
in the interest of global social harmony.
An  effective  fight  against  terrorism  requires
maximum  international  cooperation  and  coordination.
It  also  demands  a  soul-searching  review  of  our
political, economic and social policies and practices in
dealing  with  current  global  challenges.  The  aim  is  to
deny  evil-doers  any  reason  to  carry  out  their  terror
schemes to advance their own agendas.
to  convene  an 
While we stress the importance and relevance of
all United Nations resolutions and instruments relating
to  the  suppression  of  terrorism,  Kuwait  endorses  the
call 
international  conference  on
terrorism.  A  key  purpose  of  that  proposed  meeting
would be to set out a clear definition of terrorism that
draws  a  line  between  terrorism  as  a  phenomenon  that
strikes at international peace and security and the right
of  peoples  to  struggle  against  occupation  with  a  view
to achieving self-determination, in line with the Charter
of  the  United  Nations  and  the  norms  of  international
law.
Kuwait  is  in  full  sympathy  with  the  friendly
people  of  Afghanistan,  who  have  endured  a  great  and
steady  decline  in  their  living  conditions  for  over  20
years.  The  relentless  conflicts  and  wars  that  have
afflicted  Afghanistan  for  too  long  have  destroyed  the
infrastructure and resources of that country. In response

the  appeal  of 
to 
the  Secretary-General  seeking
resources to meet the severe humanitarian crisis of the
Afghan  people, 
the  Government  of  Kuwait  has
announced  a  donation  of  $3  million  in  support  of
international  humanitarian 
efforts.  Three
shipments  of  relief  aid  have  also  been  sent  to  the
Afghan  refugees.  These  supplies  are  distributed  in
coordination  with  the  Office  of  the  United  Nations
High  Commissioner  for  Refugees.  Furthermore,  back
in  Kuwait,  we  are  organizing  a  public  fund-raising
campaign  to  solicit  donations  from  individuals  and
private  companies  to  alleviate  the  suffering  of  the
Afghan people. The total yield of that effort now stands
at over $8 million.

awaited peace and security. National reconciliation and
a national coalition Government, elected by the people
of  Afghanistan,  that  represent  all  factions  and  ethnic
groups are perhaps the most viable means to ensure the
sustainability of the country and eventually its recovery
of normal status within the region and the world. Only
then will the nation of Afghanistan be able to channel
its  energy  and  resources  towards  reconstruction  and
development.
In  the  meantime,  while  we  express  our  deep
regret  for  the  civilian  casualties  among  the  Afghan
population, we sincerely hope that the ongoing military
operations  against  the  bastions  of  terrorism  and  the
terrorists  will  cause  no  injuries  to  innocent,  unarmed
people who are totally powerless and helpless.

The  eyes  of  the  world  have  been  fixed  for  over
one year now on the valiant uprising of the Palestinian
people,  which  arose  as  a  natural  and 
legitimate
response  to  the  continued  Israeli  occupation  of  the
Palestinian  territories  and  to  the  backtracking  of  the
Israeli Government from the accords it signed with the
Palestinian side.
The obvious policy of the Government of Israel is
to  reject  any  Palestinian,  regional  or  international
initiative. Instead, it counts as a matter of policy on the
use  of  force;  state  terrorism  and  the  creation  of  faits
accomplis  on  the  ground.  It  slams  every  door  that  is
opened, designs new oppressive measures and triggers
one  crisis  after  another.  Its  overriding  goal  is  to  abort
the  peace  promise  born  in  Madrid  in  1991.  Israel’s
barbaric  practices,  its  blatant  challenge  to  all  United
Nations  resolutions  and  its  excessive  and  unwarranted
use  of  lethal  force  in  response  to  stone-throwing
Palestinians  have 
an
overwhelming  sense  of  despair,  frustration  and  gloom
in the Palestinian ranks.

Here  one  must  ponder  the  hard  lessons  we  have
all  learned  from  similar  situations  of  unalloyed  gloom
and doom. It is precisely against this backdrop that the
United  Nations,  the  international  community  and  the
United  States  in  particular,  as  a  co-sponsor  of  the
Middle  East  peace  process,  must  assume  a  special
international  responsibility  to  mount  an  effective  and

undertakings and commitments set forth in its bilateral
agreements with the Palestinian Authority, as well as to
implement  Security  Council  and  General  Assembly
resolutions,  including  those  relating  to  the  city  of
Jerusalem,  with  a  view  to  preserving  its  Arab  and
Islamic character and its holy religious identity. Kuwait
therefore  welcomes  the  indications  of  support  by  the
United  States  for  the  establishment  of  an  independent
Palestinian  State.  We  hope  that  this  declared  position
will  now  be  translated  into  concrete  steps  that  will
move  the  whole  peace  process  forward  towards  its
long-awaited outcome.

In  this  context,  let  me  stress  that  Kuwait  will
continue  to  support  our  Palestinian  brothers  and  to
provide all possible political and material assistance to
them  until  they  attain  all  their  legitimate  political
rights,  including  the  establishment  of  an  independent
Palestinian State on their own territory, with Jerusalem

unconditionally withdraw from the Syrian Arab Golan
and the Lebanese Shab’a farms.
The main objective of Kuwait’s foreign policy is
to  consolidate  security  and  stability  throughout  the
Arabian  Gulf  region.  This  goal  will  remain  unmet
unless  and  until  Iraq  implements  all  relevant  Security
Council  resolutions.  It  is,  indeed,  regrettable  that  the
Government of Iraq persists in its allegations that it has
carried  out  all  its  obligations  under  those  resolutions.
In  addition,  that  Government  continues  to  pursue  its
long-standing  hostile  practices  and  policies  towards
Kuwait  in  order  to  heighten  regional  tension  and  to
destabilize  security  and  peace.  Kuwait  has  repeatedly
drawn  the  attention  of  the  Security  Council  and  the
Secretary-General  to  the  non-peaceful  intentions  of
Iraq,  as  exemplified  by  the  recurrent  threats  made  to
Kuwait’s  security  and  sovereignty  by  many  high-level
Iraqi  Government  officials.  Kuwait  has  also  called  on
the  Security  Council  to  bring  pressure  to  bear  on  the

the  emergence  of 
the  developing  nations, 
Over  the  past  few  years,  the  world  economic
scene  has  undergone  remarkable  changes.  We  have
seen 
several  new  economic
phenomena  created  by  the  revolution  in  information
technology  and  the  immense  scientific  progress  in
communications  and 
trade.  These  changes  and
for  many
phenomena  have  made 
countries,  especially 
to
introduce  drastic  changes  to  their  economic  plans  and
structures in an attempt to benefit from the globalized
economy  with  a  view  to  ensuring  development  and
progress  for  their  societies.  Despite  the  promise  of
substantial  benefits  as  a  result  of  policies  to  liberalize
world  trade  and  eliminate  customs  barriers,  we  still
have  to  make  a  concerted  effort  in  order  to  make  the
globalization  process  a  positive  force  that  benefits  all
the peoples of the world. This will require the drawing
up  of  regional  and 
international  guidelines  and
standards  that  protect  the  nascent  economies  of  the
developing  nations  from  economic  turbulence  and
crises that might otherwise have an adverse impact on
the living conditions of their peoples.
In the meantime, the developed countries and the
international  financial  institutions  should  double  their
financial  aid  to  the  developing  countries  in  order  to
enable  them  to  strengthen  the  underpinnings  of  their
economic structures. In the long term, this will help to
establish  more  balanced  economic  relations  built  on
mutual benefit and common interest. With that in mind,
Kuwait  is  pursuing  a  steadfast  policy  of  support  for
developmental  projects  in  many  developing  countries.
Most recently, Kuwait has contributed $1 million to the
fund  established  by  the  Secretary-General  to  combat
the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

sense  of  common  social  responsibility  and  social

the  General  Assembly,  and 
for 
We  are  delighted  with  the  award  of  the  Nobel
Peace Prize to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,
and  to  our  Organization.  I  want,  in  particular,  to
congratulate  the  Secretary-General  and  to  wish  him
every  success  in  his  new  term  of  office.  His  personal
qualities and extraordinary leadership give shape to the
modern  face  of  the  United  Nations  in  ways  that  give
force  and  credibility  to  the  Organization  and  its
performance.
The  terrorist  attacks  of  11  September  marked  a
turning  point  in  the  history  of  our  era.  These  terrible
events  give  special  significance  to  this  session  of  the
Assembly.  We  need  to  send  out  from  this  house  an
unambiguous message.
innocent  civilian 
The clear view of my Government is that there is
no room for moral equivocation. The deliberate taking
of 
life,  regardless  of  cause  or
grievance, is without justification in law and is morally
unacceptable.  My  Government  has  declared  its  strong
condemnation of the attacks in New York, Washington,
D.C., and Pennsylvania, and I want today to underscore
that condemnation in unequivocal terms.
On  behalf  of  my  country  and  its  citizens,  I  want
to  renew  to  the  Government  and  the  people  of  the
United  States  our  profound  feelings  of  sorrow  and
sympathy  and  our  committed  solidarity  and  support.  I
also  want  to  say  that  the  leadership,  magnificent
example  and  courage  shown  by  the  United  States
demonstrate  beyond  doubt  the  extraordinary  strengths
of that great democracy and the indomitable spirit of its
people.
This  was  a  most  monstrous  crime,  evil 
in
premeditation  and  merciless  in  execution.  Thousands
of  innocent  lives  were  taken,  thousands  of  people
murdered without warning. To the families and friends
of the victims — which included citizens of many other
countries  represented  in  this  Hall  —  we  extend  our
warm and heartfelt condolences.
Terrorism is an offence against the core values of
the  United  Nations.  It  is  a  direct  and  most  serious
threat  to  democracy,  to  the  free  exercise  of  human
rights and to economic and social development. It has
no respect for social order, human life and property.

This has never been clearer than in the aftermath
of  these  terrible  attacks  against  the  United  States.
Furthermore, these horrific events not only have served
to  highlight  the  need  for  a  concerted  and  effective
international response but have also drawn attention to
the inadequacy of the traditional forms of judicial and
law enforcement in combating it.
from 
the 
to 
response 
There  cannot  be  any  question  as  to  the  need  for
an 
international
effective 
community.  Indeed,  the  Security  Council’s  unanimous
and  momentous  resolution  1373  (2001),  together  with
resolution 1368 (2001), gives the clearest signal of the
international  community’s  determination 
take
concrete  action  against  the  financing,  training  and
movement  of  terrorists  and  the  need  for  all  States  to
cooperate  in  any  campaign  against  them.  We  believe
they  provide  the  necessary  basis  for  securing  the
broadest possible international support and cooperation
for the global campaign against terrorism, in particular
through the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee.
I  am  pleased  to  announce  that  as  part  of  its  own
response in this collective effort, Samoa is taking steps
to adhere to additional United Nations conventions on
international terrorism.
We  believe,  however,  that  we  need  to  bear  in
mind  that  fighting  terrorism  cannot  be  separated  from
the  task  of  preventing  organized  crime  and  the  spread
of  small  arms  and  other  weapons,  and  of  containing
and  ending  conflict.  We  also  need  to  ensure  that  the
conditions  of  poverty  and  despair,  which  breed
ignorance,  hatred,  violence  and  extremism,  are
properly and effectively addressed.
to  remain  resolute 
We  need,  above  all, 
in
upholding  the  rule  of  law  and  the  principles  that
underpin the rule of law. The clear affirmation of these
principles  and  of  the  norms  of  humanitarian  and
international  law  will  help  deny  to  the  perpetrators  of
these crimes whatever they seek to gain from violence.
We  consider  it  essential  to  renew  efforts  to
promote the rapid entry into force of the Rome Statute
of  the  International  Criminal  Court.  A  functioning
international  criminal  court  for  the  prosecution  of
terrorist acts amounting to crimes against humanity —
as we consider the attacks on the United States to be —
would  provide  a  vital  component  in  the  international
armoury against terrorism.
for 
implementing 
This  fifty-sixth  session  of  the  Assembly  is  the
first  to  follow  last  year’s  Millennium  Summit.  It  will
be the ideal occasion to take up the critical issues and
strategies 
the  Millennium
Declaration.  May  I  say  in  this  connection  that  we
warmly  welcome  and  find  most  useful  the  road  map
report  of  the  Secretary-General,  setting  out  in  some
detail how the Summit commitments could be fulfilled.
We  note  that  most  of  the  targets  set  by  the
Millennium  Declaration  are  not  really  new.  They  are
the  determined  results  of  global  conferences  of  the
1990s  or  are  derived  from  the  body  of  international
norms  and  laws  that  have  been  codified  over  the  past
50 years. It follows that the plans of action needed for
reaching  the  targets  have,  for  the  most  part,  already
been  developed  and  formally  adopted  by  Member
States.
What  is  needed,  therefore,  is  not  more  technical
or feasibility studies. Rather, as the Secretary-General’s
report  points  out,  States  need  to  demonstrate  the
political  will  to  carry  out  commitments  already  made
and  to  implement  strategies  already  worked  out.  In
other words, as we move from an era of commitment to
an era of implementation, the international community
must  mobilize  the  will  and  the  resources  needed  to
fulfil the promises made.
Samoa  was  honoured  recently  to  host  a  Pacific
regional meeting as part of the preparatory work for the
World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development 
in
Johannesburg  next  September.  It  is  important  to  seek
further progress in these preparations, especially in the
completion  of  national  assessment  reports.  We  believe
the Summit will be a unique opportunity to re-establish
international  commitment  to  sustainable  development.
Our  own  view  is  that  there  is  a  need  to  accelerate  the
comprehensive and targeted implementation of Agenda
21.  Efforts  to  this  end  should  aim  to  minimize  and
remove  obstacles  that  impede  the  implementation  of
the  Rio  commitments,  especially  in  capacity-building
needs  and  in  the  provision  of  adequate  financial  and
technological support.

a  full  range  of  substantive  issues  to  be  addressed.  It
would be important to forge broad-based consensus on
all these issues, and even more so on the reform of the
international  financial  and  trade  architecture  in  a  way
A/56/PV.47
that would be supportive of the long-term development
of  developing  countries.  There  should  be  enhanced
opportunities for the representation and participation of
developing  countries,  including  small  island  States,  in
the  major  decision-making 
institutions  on  global
financing, monetary and trade issues.
technologies  (ICT) 
It  is  impossible  today  to  visualize  progress  and
development  without  access  to  modern  information
systems.  The  remarkable  growth  of  information  and
communication 
is  opening  up
boundless  new  possibilities  for  accelerated  economic
and social development. But the ability to translate the
full potential of ICT differs from country to country. I
know my country needs to develop its own capacity to
do so. Yet we know that, for a developing country like
my  own,  there  is  no  real  option  but  to  take  full
advantage  of  the  digital  revolution.  We  will  therefore
be supporting every global effort to call attention to the
need for bridging the digital divide.
The  turn  of  the  millennium  has  brought  new
challenges,  and  with  it  changes  to  the  character  and
complexity  of  the  United  Nations  role  in  maintaining
international  peace  and  security.  Samoa  is  proud  to
have  been  able  to  contribute  to  the  civilian  police
operations  in  East  Timor.  From  this  experience  it  is
clear to us that if the United Nations is to do its job of
maintaining international peace and security, it needs to
be given the necessary tools and resources.
We  have  learned  a  great  deal  from  the  report  of
the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations, and we
know  that  the  United  Nations  needs  to  improve  its
capacity  to  respond  to  conflicts  more  effectively.  And
we  need  to  move  forward  with  the  peacekeeping
reform process.
The  recognition  implicit  in  the  awarding  of  the
Nobel  Peace  Prize  to  the  United  Nations  means  that
more  than  ever,  we  need  to  modernize  and  strengthen
our  Organization.  We  fully  support  the  current  efforts
to  review  and  revitalize  the  working  methods  of  the
General Assembly.
We  commend  most  highly  the  work  of  the
General  Assembly’s  Open-ended  Working  Group  on
reform of the Security Council and its Bureau. Difficult
and critical issues remain. But we need to maintain the
political  momentum  provided 
the  Millennium
Summit  for  comprehensive  reform  of  the  Security
Council.  Membership  of  the  Council,  both  permanent
and non-permanent, needs to be enlarged to reflect the

in  1999, 
the  General  Assembly, 
Finally, let me refer to the twenty-second special
session  of 
that
reviewed  the  Barbados  Programme  of  Action  for  the
Sustainable  Development  of  Small  Island  Developing
States. Since that time, a number of global events, such
as  the  tenth  session  of  the  United  Nations  Conference
on  Trade  and  Development  and  the  Third  United
Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries
have recalled the fragility of small island States in the
globalizing  economy.  We,  of  course,  are  grateful  for
this acknowledgement. However, I believe I reflect the
aspiration  of  all  small  island  States  in  saying  that  we
need  to  do  much  more  in  terms  of  concrete  actions  -
actions that will only be meaningful if we are assured
of  the  committed  support  of  the  whole  international
community.
Overcoming  the  well-recognized  vulnerability  of
small  island  States  like  my  own,  and  the  exposure  of
island  communities  to  the  effects  of  global  climate
change,  natural  disasters,  environmental  damage  and
global economic shocks will be an essential element of
sustainable development in all small island regions.
May  I  say,  in  this  connection,  that  Samoa  very
much welcomes the successful conclusion yesterday in
Marrakech of the seventh session of the Conference of
the  Parties 
the  United  Nations  Framework
Convention on Climate Change. The completion of the
operational details of the Kyoto Protocol will, we hope,
open 
ratification  by
Governments and the Protocol’ s early entry into force,
perhaps by the time of the Johannesburg World Summit
next year.
to  widespread 
to 
the  way 
The struggle against climate change is not just an
environmental issue. It is also a matter of fundamental
development.  It  is  so  because  the  adverse  impact  of
climate  change  endangers  economic  and 
social
progress.  This  is  most  certainly  the  case  for  small
island  States,  which  are  widely  acknowledged  to  be
among the most vulnerable and the least able to adapt.
The  world  community’s  response  to  climate  change
therefore  requires  significant,  long-term  changes  in
economic and social behaviour. The United Nations has
an urgent and vital responsibility in this task as well.

I  have  great  pleasure 
Crown  Prince  Albert  (Principality  of  Monaco)
(spoke  in  French):  In  taking  the  floor  here  at  the
Headquarters  of  our  Organization  —  recipient  of  the
2001  Nobel  Peace  Prize  —  meeting  in  New  York,
which has been so tragically attacked, I wish naturally,
at  the outset,  to  renew  to  the  delegation  of  the  United
States  and  the  great  country  it  represents,  our  friend,
and  the  American  people  the  expression  of  heartfelt
sympathy  of  the  Principality  of  Monaco.  Confronted
with insane actions that prompt horror and indignation,
we find ourselves in natural solidarity in this ordeal, as
well  as  in  the  task  that  now  faces  the  international
community  of  making  decisions  and  working  so  that
our States and societies will be spared other appalling
violent acts in the future.
I  would  like  once  again  to  extend  to  you,  Mr.
President,  and  to  all  the  members  of  the  Bureau  our
sincere  congratulations  on  your  election 
the
presidency  of  this  session  of  the  General  Assembly.  I
am  confident  that,  under  your  great  leadership,  our
work  will  be  carried  out  in  a  way  that  will  best  meet
the expectations of the international community. I also
wish  to  assure  you  of  the  spirit  of  cooperation  of  the
delegation of Monaco.
to 
I  also  wish  to  hail  the  brilliant  re-election  of  the
Secretary-General,  a  clear  sign  of  the  confidence  that
we  have  in  his  intelligence  and  humanity,  which  are
linked to his profound knowledge of the circumstances
in which he must discharge his noble mission regarding
world affairs, of which our Organization is seized. We
also wish to assure him of the great satisfaction that the
Principality  of  Monaco,  my  country,  shares  at  the
renewal of his mandate and of our full support, which
we will continue to offer him.
to  him 
We  are  very  gratified  that  the  2001  Nobel  Peace
Prize  was  awarded 
jointly  with  our
Organization, a fully deserved and justified reward that
should  motivate  us  —  the  States  Members  of  the
United  Nations  —  to  work  together  even  more  with
him to champion peace and to fight the many seeds of
conflict  that  threaten  our  world,  terrorism,  human
rights  violations,  underdevelopment  and  pandemics
such as AIDS.
to 
The tragic circumstances in which this session of
the General Assembly is taking place make it our duty
to  contribute  with  even  greater  determination  than  in
the  past  to  the  struggle  against  terrorism.  Owing  to
their enormity and to the defiance that is behind them,
its  manifestations  can,  as  we  have  seen,  pose  a  grave
threat 
international  peace  and  security.  The
Principality  of  Monaco  firmly  supports  everything  the
Organization  has  adopted  and  implemented  to  stifle
this  scourge,  which  can  be  so  devastating  to  the
principles  we  all  hold.  The  fact  that  what  a  lawyer
would  call  “edged  weapons”  were  enough  to  bring
down  one  of  the  most  modern  and  sophisticated
symbols of human creativity reminds us of the fragility
of our societies, which densely populated urban centres
and interdependence in all vital areas make even more
vulnerable  in  the  light  of  the  boundless  contempt  of
some for human life and human dignity.
to  maintain 
Among  the  most  important  of  the  commitments
our  States  have  undertaken  on  behalf  of  their  peoples
by  signing  the  Charter  of  the  United  Nations  are  the
obligations 
international  peace  and
security,  to  develop  friendly  relations  among  nations
and 
to  encourage  respect  for  human  rights  and
fundamental freedoms: commitments  that a handful  of
terrorists,  in  their  blind  facelessness,  rejected  with
appalling arrogance and savage brutality.
Two  months  to  the  day  have  elapsed  since  that
tragic  event.  Although  emotions  have  by  no  means
subsided,  the  healing  effects  of  time  are  beginning  to
give  us  a  little  of  the  sense  of  distance  that  is  so
necessary  for  more  objective  consideration  of  this
astonishing  political  challenge  and  this  unacceptable
human tragedy.
The  General  Assembly  very  quickly  undertook
such consideration through its debate in early October
on  measures  to  eliminate  international  terrorism.  For
A/56/PV.47
its  part,  the  Security  Council  had  already  correctly
marked out the initial path and the principal guidelines.
And  the  Secretary-General  has  repeatedly  called  on
Member States to remain more united than ever, and it
appears that his words have been heeded.
Although  the  nature  of  terrorism  did  not  change
on 11 September, its scale did. The General Assembly
decided  to  respond  with  a  complete  cohesiveness  that
has  been  rare  in  its  history.  By  adopting  its  resolution
1373 (2001), the Security Council did not shrink from
drawing on the full scope and range of its powers under
Chapter VII of the Charter; it took note of the existence
of  a  threat  to  peace  and  an  act  of  aggression  and  thus

We also, and very often, give thought to the seas
and  the  oceans,  which  made  such  a  contribution  in
ancient  times  to  meetings  of  civilizations  and  to  the
spread  of  knowledge,  thus  enriching  art  and  culture
while developing trade and solidarity. A few days from
now,  the  delegation  of  Monaco  will  state  its  views
during the consideration of the agenda item on oceans
and  the  law  of  the  sea.  My  country  has  always  been
devoted  to  better  scientific  knowledge  and  careful

convinced  of  that;  in  the  Mediterranean  area  we  are
engaged in the trade, culture and technological spheres,
and  are  working  to  promote  sustainable  development
and  environmental  protection.  Nor  should  we  neglect
activities  which  by  their  nature  tend  to  bring  together
men  and  women  from  different  backgrounds,  such  as
artistic  and  cultural  events,  academic  meetings  and
sporting competitions. In the Assembly’s debate on the
agenda  item  entitled  “Building  a  peaceful  and  better
world  through  sport  and  the  Olympic  ideal”,  the
delegation of Monaco will recall the irreplaceable role
in  that  connection  of  physical  education  and  sport,  as
well as of the Olympic games.
Another  way 
to  bring  human  communities
together  is  the  multilingualism  for  which  the  United
Nations  must  be  a  model.  That  key  item  is  on  the
Assembly’s  agenda  this  year.  The  Principality  of
Monaco  will  state  its  views  on  that  subject  and  will
stress the remarkable and unquestionable advantages of
multilingualism  for  genuine  understanding  and  mutual

understand that increased security is for the protection
of us all, and therefore to render our cooperation in that
spirit.

for  the  efficient  manner  in  which  he  has  been  guiding
this session under unprecedented circumstances. Japan
is  determined  to  continue  to  extend  its  full  support  to
the President.
I  would  also  like  on  this  occasion  to  extend  my
sincere  congratulations  to  the  Secretary-General,  Mr.
Kofi Annan, and to the United Nations on being named
the  recipients  of  the  Nobel  Peace  Prize  this  year.  I
believe  it  is  indeed  a  reflection  of  the  international
community's  appreciation  for  the  efforts  of  the  United
A/56/PV.47
the 
Nations,  under  the  leadership  of  Secretary-General
Annan, for world peace and prosperity. The challenges
facing 
international  community,  however,  are
becoming increasingly diverse and difficult, and Japan
will  cooperate  fully  with  the  activities  of  the  United
Nations in responding to these situations.
I  deeply  mourn  the  deaths  of  the  victims  of  the
series  of  heinous  terrorist  attacks  against  the  United
States  on  11  September,  who  have  left  behind  loving
families  and  friends  in  the  United  States  and  in  many
other countries. I extend my sincere condolences to the
bereaved  families  and  to  all  the  people  and  the
Government of the United States.
It  is  no  exaggeration  to  say  that  the  terrorist
attacks  are  threats  against  all  humankind  and  are
challenges  to  democracy  and  freedom  throughout  the
world.  The  international  community  must  establish  a
world-wide circle of cooperation for the elimination of
terrorism.  In  this  context,  I  am  encouraged  that,  in

financing  of  terrorism,  immigration  control,  aviation
and  maritime  safety,  measures  against

The President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.
Jan Petersen, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Norway.
Mr.  Petersen  (Norway):  First,  I  would  like  to
congratulate  you,  Sir,  on  your  assumption  of  the
presidency of the General Assembly.
For more than half a century, the United Nations
has  helped  to  settle  conflicts  and  restore  peace.  We
must reinforce these efforts and focus our work.
For more than half a century, the United Nations
has worked to promote human rights and economic and
social  development.  We  must  continue  to  invest  in
human dignity.
For more than half a century, the United Nations
has  given  millions  of  people  hope  for  a  better  future.
Such  hope  has  never  been  more  important  than  it  is
today.
The  Nobel  Peace  Prize  could  not  have  been
awarded  to  more  deserving  candidates  than  Secretary-
General  Kofi  Annan  and  the  United  Nations.  Let  me
once again extend my heartfelt congratulations.
The  terrorist  attacks  on  11  September  were  not
only directed at innocent people. They were directed at
the very values on which the United Nations is based.
We  stand  united  in  our  condemnation  of  these
attacks,  in  our  call  for  international  cooperation  to
prevent and eradicate terrorism and to bring the guilty
to  justice.  We  will  fight  terrorism  by  all  appropriate
means:  political,  diplomatic, 
legal,  financial  and
military.
Norway  pledges  its  full  support  to  the  broad
global  coalition  against  terrorism.  We  are  part  of  the
Atlantic Alliance. We fully support the United States in
defending itself against international terrorism. We are
implementing 
the  provisions  of  Security  Council
resolution 1373 (2001) by taking concrete steps to dry
up the financial resources of terrorist networks.
The  Taliban  regime  has  refused  to  adhere  to
mandatory Security Council decisions. It is harbouring
and  supporting  terrorists,  in  blunt  contravention  of
Council  resolutions.  The  Taliban  are  refusing 
to
cooperate  with  the  international  community  in  our
common  efforts  to  eradicate  international  terrorism.
The  use  of  military  force  is  therefore  the  only  option
left.
The military operations in Afghanistan are aimed
at the terrorists and those who harbour them. They are
not  aimed  at  innocent  civilians  or  at  Afghanistan  as  a
country.  They  are  aimed  at  a  group  of  extremists  who
are  exploiting  a  world  religion  for  their  own  evil
purposes.
Afghanistan  has  suffered  misrule  and  war  for
decades.  While  the  immediate  task  is  to  end  terrorism
and provide humanitarian support to those in need, we
must  work  in  parallel  for  a  political  solution.  This  is
primarily  the  responsibility  of  the  Afghan  people
themselves,  but  the  international  community  must
assist.  The  United  Nations  must  have  a  leading  role.
Planning and preparations must start now. We strongly
support  the  efforts  of  the  Secretary-General’s  Special
Representative  for  Afghanistan,  Lakhdar  Brahimi,  to
help  lay  the  foundation  for  a  broad-based  and  lasting
political solution.

humanitarian assistance both inside Afghanistan and in
neighbouring  countries.  But  while  seeking  to  meet
immediate  needs,  we  must  also  focus  on  the  longer-
term  assistance  that  will  be  necessary  to  rebuild  this
A/56/PV.47
war-torn  society.  We  must  improve  respect  for  human
rights  and  help  the  Afghan  people,  in  particular
women,  who  have  suffered  so  terribly  under  Taliban
rule. These are issues that Norway will focus on during
its  chairmanship  of  the  Afghanistan  Support  Group
next  year.  Only  through  coordinated  efforts  can  we
contribute to security and development in Afghanistan.
A  year  ago,  peace  between  the  Israelis  and  the
Palestinians appeared to be at hand. Today, the hope for
peace and security has given way to disillusion, despair
and the murder of civilians.
We  are  convinced  that  the  only  way  out  of  the
current stalemate is through the full implementation of
the  recommendations  in  the  Mitchell  report,  which
have  been  endorsed  by  both  parties  and  by  the
international community.
First of all, there must be an immediate end to the
violence.  Terrorism  must  be  stopped.  The  cycle  of
violent  action  and  reaction  must  be  broken.  Political
leaders on both sides must do everything in their power
to halt the violence and reduce the tension.
Secondly,  confidence-building  measures  must  be
implemented simultaneously. Trust must be rebuilt step
by step, since without it there can be no real dialogue
or  negotiation.  The  Mitchell  report  lists  several  steps
for restoring trust. Given the high level of hostility and
mistrust,  the  timing  and  sequence  of  these  steps  are
crucial. Decisions must be made now.
Thirdly,  the  parties  must  find  a  way  back  to  the
negotiating table. A halt to the violence, the resumption
of security cooperation and steps to restore trust cannot
be  sustained  for  long  without  serious  negotiations  to
resolve the underlying causes of the conflict.
Norway  will  continue  to  support  efforts  to  bring
about a peaceful resolution of the conflict. As Chair of
the  Ad  Hoc  Liaison  Committee,  we  stand  ready  to
work  with  other  donors  to  help  restore  the  economic
and social infrastructure in the Palestinian areas.
The  bulk  of  the  conflicts  dealt  with  by  the
Security  Council  are  found  on  the  African  continent.
As  a  member  of  the  Security  Council,  Norway  is
determined  to  do  what  it  can  to  promote  long-term
peace  and  stability  in  Africa.  Most  of  the  conflicts  in
Africa  clearly  demonstrate  the  close  links  between
peace,  good  governance  and  development.  The  root
causes of many of these conflicts are poverty and lack
15
A/56/PV.47
of  development,  but  also  violations  of  human  rights
and disrespect for basic democratic principles.
Norway stands ready to assist in building a sound
foundation  for  good  governance  and  development  in
Africa. The developments in Burundi are encouraging,
although  we  recognize  that  the  peace  process  is  still
very  fragile.  The  deployment  of  a  multinational
security  force,  on  the  initiative  of  South  Africa,  will,
hopefully, improve the situation in Burundi. Norway is
ready to support this initiative.

to extend our heartfelt congratulations to the Secretary-

tireless  efforts  to  achieve  the  noble  objectives  of  our

recognized  by  the  Nobel  Academy,  which  decided  to
award  the  2001  Nobel  Peace  Prize  jointly  to  the
Secretary-General  and 
the  United  Nations.  This
distinction reflects the most striking recognition of the
efforts  undertaken  by  our  Organization  to  strengthen

In 
It  is  obvious  that  the  role  and  international
legitimacy  of  the  United  Nations  in  bringing  about
international  peace,  security  and  stability  must  be
enhanced. No one must suggest that fighting terrorism
is  a  campaign  by  one  civilization  against  another,  or
the  supposed  supremacy  of  one  civilization  over  any
other.  To  the  contrary,  we  must  act  together  to  show
that the endeavour to eliminate terrorism marks a new
phase  in  humankind’s  march  forward,  building  on  the
heritage  of  all  civilizations  and  converging  in  an
expression  of  our  common  aspiration  to  a  secure  life
and a better future.
In 
that  connection,  my  country  notes  with
satisfaction  the  sustained  efforts  and  the  success  of
repeated  appeals  to  bring  peace  to  the  Middle  East  so
that  the  peoples  of  that  region  can  live  in  peace,
security and prosperity. We hope that the peace process
will  be  resumed  in  accordance  with  the  principles
enunciated  at  the  Madrid  Conference,  in  keeping  with
the principle of land for peace, and in conformity with
Security  Council  resolutions  242  (1967),  338  (1973)
and  425  (1978),  thus  bringing  about  the  complete

supports the efforts of the Secretary-General and of his
Personal  Envoy,  Mr.  James  A.  Baker  III,  to  guarantee

enjoy the support of all parties concerned.
Turning  to  developments  in  the  Lockerbie  crisis,
we  welcome  the  success  of  diplomatic  initiatives,  but
at the same time feel that the Security Council should
act to lift the embargo imposed on Libya.
We hail everything that has been done to resolve
conflicts  and  wars  on  the  African  continent,  which
have  stymied  development  efforts  there.  We  welcome

support  it  has  won  from  our  development  partners  in
terms, inter alia, of sources of financing.
It  has  now  been  proven  that  phenomena  such  as
violence  and  extremism  are  the  outgrowth  of  poverty
and  frustration.  The  international  community  must
therefore  go  further  to  demonstrate  its  solidarity  and
help achieve social development throughout the world.

Mr.  Harri  Holkeri.  I  renew  my  respects

My  Belgian  colleague  has  already  addressed  the
Assembly  on  behalf  of  the  15  States  members  of  the
European Union in a statement with which my country
aligns  itself  completely.  I  would,  however,  like  to
reflect upon certain issues on the international agenda.
First,  I  cannot  fail  to  refer  to  the  tragic  terrorist
attacks of 11 September against the United States, and
in particular against the city of New York and innocent
citizens  of  many  nationalities.  I  reiterate  our  deep
sorrow  and  reaffirm  our  complete  solidarity  with  all
those who, like us Portuguese, were victimized by the
loss  of  their  compatriots  and  by  the  suffering  of  the
bereaved families.
We  are  dealing  with  violence  without  a  face,
violence  that  kills  indiscriminately  and  that  must  be
confronted by the international community as a whole,
irrespective  of  the  religion  we  practice,  the  race  to
which  we  belong,  the  ideology  we  follow  or  the
civilization  into  which  we  were  born.  It  falls  to  each
and every State Member of the United Nations to fight
this scourge, whose blind hatred has plunged the world
into  a  state  of  turmoil  not  seen  since  the  end  of  the
Second World War. What is most shocking to us is the
fact  that  we  are  faced  with  a  force  that  ignores  or
despises the very concept of the right to life.
We  must  embark  on  a  concerted  effort  at  all
levels  to  submit  to  justice  those  guilty  of  the  crimes
committed, with a view to avoiding a repetition of the
terrorist  acts  of  September.  We  believe  the  United
Nations has an irreplaceable role to play as the source
of 
the
international  community  in  the  fight  against  this
common  enemy.  It  is  for  other  forums  to  complement
these  actions,  orienting  and  adjusting

accordance with the concrete needs of their respective
mandates.

of innocent civilians on 11 September must be captured
and  tried,  and  their  military  infrastructure  must  be
eliminated.  In  our  view,  the  principles  guiding  the

When  the  international  community  successfully
intervenes  in  a  conflict,  it  should  not  be  turned  aside
from  the  consolidation  of  the  solutions  reached.  The
United Nations has the responsibility of maintaining an
appropriate  level  of  involvement  until  the  definitive
conclusion of the peace process, so as not to put at risk
the  investments  made  and  expectations  created.  The
United  Nations  should  proceed  without  hesitation  in
supporting the creation of viable nations.
I welcome the Security Council’s endorsement of
this  understanding  with  regard  to  East  Timor,  on  31
October.  The  international  community  cannot  neglect
the  consolidation  of  the  solutions  achieved  in  East
Timor,  whose  transition  to  independence  is,  in  fact,  a
clear  case  of  success  for  the  United  Nations  and  a

the  Community  of
Portuguese-Speaking Countries. I take this opportunity
to underline that this entire process has been conducted
in  an  exemplary  manner  by 
the  United  Nations
Transitional  Administration  in  East  Timor  under  the
leadership of Sergio Vieira de Mello.
The  work  of  the  United  Nations  towards  the
consolidation  of  a  new  and  indisputably  sovereign,
democratic  and  economically  viable  State  only
reinforces the credibility of the Organization at a time
in international life when its inspiration and leadership
are more needed than ever before to correctly manage
the great global challenges of the twenty-first century.
The President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.
Heinz  Möeller  Freile,  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs  of
Ecuador.
Mr. Möeller Freile (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish):
I congratulate you, Sir, on your well-deserved election
as President of the General Assembly. You are a worthy
representative of the Republic of Korea, a country very
close  to  my  own  through  our  important  ties  of
friendship  and  cooperation.  I  also  congratulate  your
predecessor on the highly efficient and responsible way
in  which he  oversaw the  work  of  the  previous  session
of the Assembly.
The  Government  of  Ecuador  received  with
special satisfaction the news of the award of the 2001
Nobel  Peace  Prize  to  the  United  Nations  and  the
Secretary-General,  Kofi  Annan.  We  congratulate  the
Secretary-General on this well-deserved recognition of
his  work,  which  has  promoted  among  Member  States
the benefits of international association and solidarity.

That  is  why  Ecuador  —  a  peace-loving  country
convinced  of  the  predominant  role  of  the  United
Nations  as  the  key  institution  for  decisions  affecting
the  world  —  praises 
the  General
Assembly  and  the  Security  Council  in  response  to
terrorism,  particularly 
the  Council’s  adoption  of
resolution  1373  (2001),  which  contains  the  guidelines
for all Member States to work urgently and in concert
to  prevent  and  suppress  terrorist  acts.  Likewise,  the
international community must conclude negotiations on
a comprehensive convention on international terrorism
to  strengthen  the  relevant  judicial  framework  with
concrete measures to prevent, sanction and combat this
scourge. Ecuador is committed at the national, regional
and international levels to the fight against terrorism in
all its forms and manifestations.
In  the  final  years  of  the  twentieth  century,  great
changes  took  place  in  the  world,  which  led  to  new
international  trends,  especially  in  terms  of  the  process
of  globalization  and  threats  to  international  peace  and
security.
The developing countries, such as my own, began
adapting  their  national  structures  to  deal  with  the
demands  of  a  decidedly  competitive  environment.
However,  it  must  be  said  that  it  is  obvious  that  the
adjustments and changes those countries have made to
their  policies  and  strategies  are  not  enough 
in
themselves  to  achieve  complete  results  as  long  as  the
structural  causes  of  the  disparity  between  the  level  of
development  of  highly  industrialized  economies  and
that  of  economies  in  need  of  capital  and  advanced
technology  persist.  That  disparity  continues  to  widen
because  of  financial  difficulties  caused  by  unstable
short-term  capital  flows,  persistent  external  debt  and
obstacles to truly international trade.
signs 
There  are 
that  current 
international
economic trends are far from providing the equilibrium
and  justice  needed  to  overcome  the  unfavourable
burdens  inherited  from  the  twentieth  century.  Poverty
has grown at alarming rates in all regions. International
organized  crime  has  exacerbated  violence  and
insecurity  in  society.  Massive  international  migration
towards developed regions continues to increase. These
phenomena,  along  with  many  others,  result  from  the
lack  of  real,  universal  agreements

The  problems  that  the  world  faces  today  respect
no  national  borders.  They  are  threats  demanding  not
unilateral action but responses based on solidarity and
concerted action. That interdependence is what enabled
the heads of Government and State, at the Millennium
Assembly, to agree on making the United Nations, the
supreme  multilateral  forum,  a  suitable  and  effective
instrument  to  fight  for  the  development  of  all  peoples
of  the  world;  to  fight  against  poverty,  ignorance  and
disease;  to  fight  against  injustice,  violence,  terror  and
crime;  and  to  fight  against  the  deterioration  and
destruction  of 
the  planet.  They  also  committed
themselves  to  freeing  all  people  from  the  scourge  of
war,  to  eradicating  the  dangers  posed  by  weapons  of
mass  destruction  and  to  strengthening  respect  for  the
rule of law in national and international affairs.

Ecuador,  as  a  country  that  believes  in  and
practices 
international
disputes,  regrets  and  condemns  conflicts  between
States,  as  well  as  those  within  States  caused  by  civil
war, ethnic conflict or other reasons. The Government
of  Ecuador  is  concerned  by  the  uncontrolled  violence
occurring  between  the  peoples  of  Palestine  and  Israel,
which  continues  to  reap  a  tragic  harvest  of  death  and
destruction.  We  recognize  the  right  of  the  Palestinian
people  to  a  free  and  independent  State,  as  well  as  the
State  of  Israel’s  right  to  exist  within  secure  and
internationally  recognized  borders.  Ecuador  reiterates
its  appeal  to  both  parties  to  quickly  return  to  peace
negotiations.
Last  August,  Ecuador  assumed  the  presidency  of

phenomenon  as  old  as  humanity  itself,  undoubtedly
linked  to  the  historical  development  of  civilization.  I
am  referring  to  the  enormous  challenge  posed  by  the
increase  in  human  migration,  especially  from  the
countries of the South towards the North.
We  are  witnessing 
the 
While  migration  has  been  positive  in  that  it  has
contributed 
to  fruitful  exchange  between  various
peoples  and  has  deepened  dialogue  processes  and
mutual  enrichment  between  diverse  cultures,  in  most
cases  the  reason  for  it  stems  from  the  individual’s
desire  to  seek  better  living  conditions  and  broader
A/56/PV.47
economic prospects. We cannot think of human history
without  the  constant  and  ever  present  phenomenon  of
migration,  and  the  current  era  is  no  exception.  In  the
present  age  of  the  globalization  of  markets  and  the
possibility  of  a  new  round  of  multilateral 
trade
negotiations  in  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO),
the  liberalization  of  the  administration  of  services
through 
the  free  movement  of  persons  must  be
emphasized.
Today  many  developing  countries  of  the  world,
afflicted  by  the  serious  consequences  of  economic
crisis  and  the  prevalence  of  structural  failures  that  are
difficult  to  overcome,  have  become  net  producers  of
migrants, men and women who feel compelled to seek
broader  horizons  legally.  Ecuador  is  one  of  those
countries  because  of  the  most  serious  economic  crisis

consequences  for  individuals  are  painful  and  stir  our
conscience.  Because  of  that,  my  country  has  taken  a
series  of  actions  to  protect  the  rights  of  migrants  and
their  families.  With  the  support  of  the  International
Organization  for  Migration,  we  have  held  several
meetings  in  which  the  State  and  civil  society  have
participated. They have enabled us, on the one hand, to
have  direct  testimony  about  the  serious  problems  of
this group of individuals who have left their countries
voluntarily  to  find  better  opportunities  and,  on  the
other  hand,  to  obtain  concrete  commitments  aimed  at
protecting  and  defending  human  rights.  I  wish  to
underline  the  transnational  nature  of  the  migration
problem,  which  requires  active  cooperation  between
countries of origin and countries receiving immigrants,
as  well  as  international  bodies.  In  this  context,  I  am
happy  to  point  out  that  Ecuador  and  Spain  signed  an
agreement  aimed  at 
regulating  migration,  which
undoubtedly  has  been  beneficial  for  migrant  citizens
and signatory countries.
Ecuador  appeals  to  all  Governments  and  sectors
of  civil  society,  but  particularly  to  those  of  the
developed  world  —  receivers  of  migrant  workers  -  to
redouble their efforts aimed at protecting the rights of

the  general  development  of 
countries, 
If the twentieth century was the stage for some of
the greatest humanitarian tragedies recorded by history,
it is true that in that period we also witnessed the birth
of a new global awareness of the urgency to protect and
promote  human  rights  and  to  preserve  man’s  home,
land and environment.
My  country  has  fully  assumed 
this  global
challenge.  We  are  signatories  to  the  main  instruments
on this important item at both the international and the
hemispheric  level,  and  we  have  national  tools  that
enable us to achieve such objectives. The National Plan
on  Human  Rights,  adopted  as  a  State  policy  in  June
1998 by civil society and the State, is perhaps the most
innovative  and  visionary  instrument  that  has  been
developed  in  our  country.  We  hope  that  it  will  enable
us  to  promote  a  real  culture  of  tolerance  and  respect
between  the  ethnic,  social  and  cultural  groups  of  our
society. With this plan, Ecuador also complied with the
mandate  of 
the  1993  Vienna  Declaration  and
Programme of Action.
in  July  2001  by 
In  keeping  with  all  the  above-mentioned  points,
Ecuador  places  importance  on  one  of  the  mandates  of
the  Carabobo  Act,  signed 
the
Presidents  of  the  Andean  Community  of  Nations,  and
has  begun  work  on  a  draft  Andean  Charter  of  Human
Rights, aimed at consolidating the ideas of respect for
and  the  promotion  of  the  fundamental  rights  and
freedoms  of  the  individual  in  the  specific  areas  of
culture  and  ethnic  plurality  characteristic  of 
the
Andean  subregion.  Ecuador  was  a  pioneer  in  this
important matter when, in 1980, within the subregional
framework, it spurred on the adoption of the Riobamba
Charter,  which  includes  among  its  postulates  the
protection  of  human 
international
obligation of all States and the condition that legitimate
joint  action  carried  out  in  protecting  such  rights  must
not  violate  the  principle  of  non-intervention.  Within
this same context, Ecuador signed the Rome Statute of
the International Court of Justice of July 1998, and it is
taking measures for its prompt ratification.

Turning  to  the  WTO  and  the  Free  Trade  Area  of
the Americas (FTAA), there is no doubt that one of the
most  important  items  on  the  foreign  policy  agenda  of
22
States  is  international  economic  relations.  Ecuador
wishes  to  express  some  views  on  this,  at  the  moment
when the Fourth WTO Ministerial Conference is taking
place in Qatar.
Ecuador  deems  it  fundamental  to  pursue  the
process  of  opening  up  trade,  reducing  tariffs  and
eliminating  unnecessary  trade  barriers.  However,  my
country  also  shares  the  doubts  of  some  developing
countries  about  the  advantages  of  launching  a  new
round  of  multilateral  trade  negotiations  when  the
commitments of the Uruguay Round have not yet been
fully  implemented,  particularly  those  relating  to  the
reduction  and  the  elimination  of  agricultural  subsidies
and  to  agreement  on  special  and  differential  treatment
provisions in favour of developing countries. These are
priority  items  of  interest  for  Ecuador,  as  is  the
expansion of openness in agricultural trade.
We  emphasize  the  necessary  reform  required  by
the  WTO  Dispute  Settlement  Understanding

Given  our  own  experience  in  this  dispute,  we
believe  that  compensation  must  be  binding,  if  we  are
really speaking about free markets in the full sense of
the  word,  and  that  retaliatory  measures  in  the  same
sector or in cross-sectors is not sufficient to repair the
damages  caused,  particularly  to  the  economies  of
developing countries. It would also be worth evaluating

Progress  in  trade  negotiations  and  the  fulfilment
of commitments already made will make it possible for
us  to  have  an  international  economic  and  financial
climate  conducive  to  investment  and  to  growth  of  the
world  economy,  which  will  make  a  positive
contribution  to  social  and  human  development.  These
same proposals give us hope in the negotiations of the
FTAA  —  the  Trade  Negotiations  Committee  of  which
Ecuador  is  currently  president.  Our  efforts  take  into
account  the  various  positions  of  countries,  as  well  as
their different levels of development and sizes of their
economies, since we must seek consensus on decisions
in  a  way  that  makes  all  the  parties  involved  feel  that
their  interests  are  guaranteed.  For  least  developed
countries, the establishment of a hemisphere-wide free-
trade  zone  poses  a  challenge  and  at  the  same  time
offers an exceptional opportunity to be fully integrated
into world economy in this new phase.

from  disproportionately 
I  turn  next  to  the  question  of  external  debt  and
development  financing.  The  enormous 
limitations

Ecuador, 
large
external-debt  servicing  costs  and  from  persistent
obstacles  to  marketing  our  exports,  work  against
national  efforts  to  engender  economic  stability  and
sustainable development. Ecuador’s total external debt
now stands at about 64 per cent of our gross domestic
product and nearly 40 per cent of our national budget;
this  has  a  negative  impact  on  the  financing  of  social
development projects.
External debt is mortgaging the economic present
and  future  of  developing  countries;  it  has  extremely
adverse  effects  because  it  devours  vast  resources  that
would otherwise be used in the fight against poverty, in
promoting public health and education, and in meeting
many other urgent social needs. The situation thus has
an 
increasing  negative  effect  on  market-oriented
national  policies  and  the  political  and  democratic
stability of many countries. It is therefore time for the

Finally,  as  an  Ecuadorian,  I  wish  to  address  the
question  of  the  Colombian  conflict.  I  wish  to  say  that

international  awareness  of 
the  global  nature  of
problems  of  peace,  security  and  development.  The
barbaric  terrorist  attacks  against  the  United  States  on
11  September,  and  their  alarming  consequences,  made
it  clear  that  terrorism  is  now  a  factor  for  worldwide
political and economic destabilization.
Algeria has conveyed its deepest sympathy to the
families of the victims of those horrible acts. It did so
with  all  the  more  sincerity  and  feeling  because  for
more than a decade Algeria itself has been enduring the
horrors  of  terrorism.  The  international  reaction  to  this
devastating  scourge  has  been  a  heartening  collective
wake-up  call.  Mobilization  and  multifaceted  action  to
combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is
now  worldwide.  In  that  regard,  Security  Council

Algeria  is  fully  cooperating  with  the  international

is  that  the  resolution  be  strictly  implemented  and
reaffirms  the  imperative  need  for  universal  adherence
to existing international anti-terrorism instruments and
for  the  ratification  of  relevant  regional  instruments.
Algeria  believes,  inter  alia,  that  the  adoption  of  a

The  dangers  that  terrorism  poses  to  global  peace

the 
The  commitments  undertaken  recently  to  make
globalization  a  factor  of  integration  rather  than  of
exclusion  —  in  particular  the  objectives  enshrined  in
the Millennium Declaration — take on full importance
here, since they highlight the urgent need for effective
measures to build a stable and united world on a solid
foundation.  Today,  reality  amply  demonstrates  that
globalization,  despite 
its  enormous  potential  and
opportunities,  has  not  yet  yielded  the  expected  results
with  regard  to  the  universal  improvement  of  living
conditions.  The  processes  to  which  it  leads  have  too
often  widened  the  existing  cracks  within  societies  and
exacerbated  differences  among  nations.  This  has
encouraged  marginal  groups  to  exploit  the  difficult
social situations to which many peoples are subject and
to promote isolationism and rejection of the other.
The  Declaration  and  Plan  of  Action  adopted  by
the  Durban  World  Conference  against  Racism,  Racial
Discrimination,  Xenophobia  and  Related  Intolerance
provide a framework for inspiration and action to build
more harmonious and fraternal relations among people.
First of all, there is a need at the United Nations
level  to  set  aright  unacceptable  situations  of  injustice
and  denial  of rights.  In  Palestine,  the  serious  situation
that  prevails  as  a  result  of  the  continued  Israeli
occupation  and  its  oppressive  practices  requires  the
attention  of  the  entire  international  community.  It
demands urgent action to put an end to the daily trials
of  the  Palestinian  people,  who  are  subjected  to  a
deliberate  policy  by  the  Israeli  army  of  intimidation,
abuse and murder. This policy is likely to endanger the
resumption  of  the  peace  process,  taking  the  entire
region to the brink of a conflagration with incalculable
consequences.
the  Palestinian  people  and 
Given  the  situation,  Algeria  reaffirms  its  total
solidarity  with 
their
inalienable right to an independent State with Al-Quds
al-Sharif as its capital. Algeria urgently calls upon the
international community to ensure the protection of the
Palestinian  people  by  sending  international  observers
to the region.
Algeria wishes to emphasize that only a solution
based on international legality — in particular Security
Council  resolutions  242  (1967)  and  338  (1973)  —  as
well  as  on  the  principle  of  land  for  peace,  adopted  at
the  Madrid  Conference,  can  ensure  just  and  lasting
peace and security for all the peoples of the region, as
Chairman  Yasser  Arafat  indicated  in  his  speech  this
morning.  Algeria  would  also  like  to  reaffirm  its
solidarity  with  the  brotherly  peoples  of  Syria  and
Lebanon  for  the  restoration  of  their  lands  still  under
Israeli  occupation.  In  addition,  Algeria  welcomes  the
decision of the Security Council to lift the sanctions on
the  brotherly  people  of  Sudan  and  seizes 
the
opportunity  to  renew  its  appeal  for  the  lifting  of  the
sanctions on the brotherly Iraqi and Libyan peoples.
The  situation  in  the  Western  Sahara,  where  the
settlement process has been halted for more than a year
and a half, is also a source of great concern and a factor
of instability in the Maghreb and in Africa as a whole.
The  United  Nations  Mission  for  the  Referendum  in
Western  Sahara  (MINURSO)  has  not  been  able  to
continue  the  implementation  of  the  settlement  plan  of
the  United  Nations  and  the  Organization  of  African
Unity (OAU), though it had been accepted by the two
parties  to  the  conflict,  the  Kingdom  of  Morocco  and
the  Frente  Popular  para  la  Liberación  de  Saguia  el-
Hamra  y  del  Río  de  Oro  (POLISARIO),  in  particular
because  of  the  many  challenges  that  followed  the
identification stage.
Action  by  the  United  Nations  in  the  Western
Sahara,  carried  out  through  MINURSO  since  1991,
should  be  commended,  and  the  progress  made  within
the framework of the implementation of the settlement
plan  —  in  particular  the  identification  of  the  electoral
body — should be maintained and consolidated. Here,
the  two  parties  should  be  reminded  of  their  obligation
to  cooperate  openly  and  sincerely  with  MINURSO,  to
A/56/PV.47
conclude  the  referendum  process  and  to  call  upon  the
bodies of the United Nations that deal with this issue to
strictly respect their mandate.
The  unswerving  position  of  Algeria  on  the  issue
of  the  Western  Sahara  stems  from  its  dedication  to
international  legality  and  to  respect  for  the  right  of
people to self-determination. Algeria therefore supports
the  holding  of  a  free  and  transparent  referendum,
organized  by  the  United  Nations  that  will  allow  this
people to decide on its destiny. Any effort or initiative
to settle that dispute must be part of the framework of

Finally,  regarding  recent  events  in  Burundi,  my
country  welcomes  the  decision  of  the  parties  to  the
conflict  there  to  establish  a  transitional  Government
that  guarantees  the  participation  of  all  the  inhabitants
of that country in the management of their own affairs.
We  hail  the  important  role  played  by  Mr.  Nelson
Mandela in achieving understanding among the parties

The  end  of  the  cold  war  eased  the  climate  of
suspicion  and  distrust  that  permeated  international
relations  and  was  replaced  by  a  measure  of  optimism
based  on  new  prospects.  We  hope  that  this  optimism
will signal an end to outdated doctrines and theories of
nuclear deterrence and the balance of terror and that it
will  open  the  way  to  a  bold  approach  to  guaranteeing
the  security  of  all  States.  Given 
this  qualitative

in  Mexico,  are  promising  prospects  for  the  lasting
resumption  of  growth  in  the  developing  countries  and
for improving the living standards of their peoples.
Four  months  ago,  African  countries,  meeting  at
the 37th Assembly of Heads of State and Government
of the Organization of African Unity in Lusaka, clearly
expressed  Africa’s  official  response  to  the  new  needs
and  aspirations  of  its  peoples  through  their  solemn
launching  of  the  transitional  process  towards  the
African  Union  and  their  adoption  of  the  New  African
Initiative.  These  steps  form  an  integral  part  of  the
reform  process  undertaken  over  the  past  few  years  by
the  African  countries  at  the  national,  regional  and
continental  levels  to  bring  Africa  into  step  with  an
ever-changing world.
Aware  of  the  magnitude  of  the  challenges  facing
the  continent  and  of  the  need  to  acquire  a  global
integrated  programme  for  the  social  and  economic
recovery of the continent, African leaders at the Lusaka
summit  adopted  a  plan  that  was  conceived  by  and  for
Africa.  Algeria,  which  actively  participated  in  the
creation  and  drafting  of  the  New  Partnership  for
African  Development,  believes  that  this  programme
will  open 
the
economic and social problems of Africa. Thus, in order
for  our  Organization  to  bolster  its  credibility  and
effectiveness,  to  address  the  great  changes  on  the
international  scene  and  to  be  more  responsive  to  the
aspirations  of  this  global  village,  it  must  earnestly
pursue  its  transformation  and  be  more  open  to  the
world and to itself.

The  progress  that  has  been  achieved  at  the

countries  must  be  consolidated  and  enhanced  through
the international promotion of good governance. In this
respect,  the  direct  and  indirect  threats  to  sustainable
development that jeopardize the survival of our planet
require us all to mobilize on a vast scale in the context
of  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development.
Urgent measures must be taken to halt the devastating
effects  of  various  means  and  types  of  production  and

word,  the  United  Nations  must  serve  the  great  family

The  President:  I  now  give  the  floor  to  His
Excellency  Mr.  Hor  Namhong,  Senior  Minister  for
Foreign  Affairs  and  International  Cooperation  of
Cambodia.
Mr.  Hor  Namhong  (Cambodia):  I  wish  to  join
other  representatives  in  congratulating  you,  Sir,  on
your unanimous election as President of the fifty-sixth
session of the General Assembly. We are confident that
26
under  your  able  guidance  the  work  of  this  General
Assembly session will be another milestone on the new
international scene, particularly in confronting the new
challenges  facing  our  world,  especially  after 
the
extremely  tragic  terrorist  attacks  of  11  September  on
the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon
in Washington, D.C.
I  believe  that  the  world  has  completely  changed
since the attacks against the United States of America,
the deadliest terrorist attacks ever committed, in which
so  many  innocent  lives  were  lost.  These  acts  of
terrorism shook the world as the images of destruction
were  broadcast  live.  They  were  undoubtedly  crimes
against  humanity.  We  must  strongly  condemn  these
terrorist  acts.  We  cannot  forget  those  who  lost  their
lives  and  the  families  of  the  victims.  In  this  regard,  I
wish to extend, on behalf of the people and the Royal
Government 
sincere
condolences to the families of the innocent victims and
the Government of the United States of America.
of  Cambodia, 
our  most 
Cambodia  fully  supports  the  United  Nations
resolutions  condemning  the  acts  of  terrorism  against
the  United  States.  Cambodia  also  fully  endorses  the
international  efforts  in  combating  terrorism  in  all  its
forms  and  manifestations.  Cambodia  is  disturbed,
however,  over  the  loss  of  innocent  civilian  lives  as  a
result  of  the  bombings  in  Afghanistan.  We  must  do
everything possible to avoid civilian casualties and loss
of life.
In order to find solutions to the current problems
facing  our  world,  I  believe  that  we  need  to  look  into
not only the root causes of terrorism but also the other
contributing  factors  that  are  confronting  the  world
today.  First,  we  need  to  look  for  a  just  and  lasting
peace in the Middle East, in particular a solution to the
Palestine problem. We need to respect the fundamental
right of self-determination of the Palestinian people. In
this  regard,  Cambodia  supports  the  creation  of  a
Palestinian  State  as  early  as  possible.  One  may  argue
that the present situation in the world may have opened
a  window  of  opportunity  for  finding  solutions  to  the
ongoing  conflict  in  the  Middle  East.  I  believe  that  all
parties  concerned  should,  and  I  hope  that  they  will,
give peace in the region a chance, which is the way to
overcome the lingering conflict in the region.
Secondly,  the increase  in  poverty  in  the  world  is
another  crucial  problem  that  must  be  addressed  with
some  sense  of  urgency  and  collective  responsibility.
A/56/PV.47
Poverty  is  unquestionably  one  of  the  major  causes  of
the problems in the world today. I think that all nations
must join hands to fight poverty throughout the world.
At  the  same  time,  we  must  work  to  reduce  the
widening  gap  between  the  developed  and  developing
countries.
In this regard, it is important for us to recall last
year’s Millennium Declaration, whose main thrust was
a war on poverty in the most comprehensive and most
inclusive  manner  possible.  For 
the  developing
countries,  one  of  the  main  challenges  in  the  war  on
poverty is managing the negative side of an irreversible
process  of  globalization.  The  key  question  is  how  to
into  an  ever-accelerating
best 
process  of  globalization  so 
the  developing
countries will not be left out or continue to be further
marginalized.  The  process  of  globalization  is  a  reality
without  precedent,  and  no  country  in  this  world  is
immune to, or able to opt out of, the process.

globalization,  which  would  enable  the  developing
countries 
to  pursue  sustainable  development  and
poverty  reduction  and  provide  the  necessary  tools  for
the  people  to  improve  their  standards  of  living.
Moreover,  we  think  that  if  there  is  no  mechanism  or
principle  which  is  universally  accepted  in  order  to
manage  globalization,  the  gap  between  the  developed
and  developing  countries  will  further  widen  in  the
future. This is a problem of human security, which the

Thirdly,  another  side  effect  of  poverty  is  the
growing  epidemic  of  HIV/AIDS  worldwide,  across
regions  and  continents,  affecting  mostly  the  poor  and
the  developing  countries.  Therefore,  we  believe  that
the rich, developed countries should do more to help in
the fight against the global HIV/AIDS epidemic.
Fourthly,  as  a  contributing  factor  for  combating
terrorism, we should attempt to find practical solutions
to  the  growing  threat  of  the  proliferation  of  nuclear
weapons  and  the  illegal  trade  of  small  arms  and  light
weapons  around  the  globe.  In  this  context,  Cambodia
fully  agrees  with  the  Secretary-General’s  statement  at
the  Millennium  Summit  that  the  issues  of  nuclear
weapons  and  illicit  trade  in  small  arms  and  light
weapons  should  be  given  the  highest  priority  on  the
United Nations agenda in the area of arms control and
27
A/56/PV.47
disarmament. In this context, Cambodia wishes to call
upon  all  countries  to  respect  all  the  nuclear-weapons-
related  treaties,  including  the  Anti-Ballistic  Missile
(ABM)  Treaty.  Cambodia  strongly  believes  that  the
international  community  should  work 
towards  a
gradual  reduction  of  nuclear  stockpiles  to  a  minimal

As a country that has suffered considerably from
the  proliferation  of  small  arms,  Cambodia  welcomes
the  adoption  of  the  Programme  of  Action  at  the
conclusion  of  the  United  Nations  Conference  on  the
Illicit  Trade  in  Small  Arms  and  Light  Weapons  in  All
Its  Aspects.  In  this  regard,  I  congratulate  the  United
Nations  on  taking  bold  steps  in  addressing  this  vitally
important issue. Since 1998, the Royal Government of
Cambodia  has  carried  out  a  nationwide  campaign  to
address the problems regarding such arms. So far more
that  120,000  small  arms  and  light  weapons  have  been
confiscated,  and  more  than  50  percent  of  them  have
been  destroyed  in  the  framework  of  an  operation
named “Flames for Peace.”

the  Kingdom  of
Cambodia  is  of  the  view  that  the  General  Assembly
and the Security Council must be reformed so that they
become more effective and more efficient. As we may
recall, one of the most important pledges contained in
last 
the
revitalization of the General Assembly. While progress
in the structural and procedural aspects of the General
Assembly are vitally important, we must not lose sight
of  the  primary  objective  of  this  exercise,  which  is  to
return to the General Assembly its original function as
the  chief  deliberative  and  representative  body  of  the
United  Nations.  In  other  words,  the  international
community,  especially  the  United  Nations  as  a  whole,
must  play  a  constructive  and  proactive  role,  without
exclusivity, including in the struggle against terrorism.
Mr.  Shaghem (Libyan  Arab  Jamahiriya),  Vice
President, took the Chair.
I  also  believe  that  the  current  global  situation
justifies  a  call  for  a  constructive  and  timely  reform  of
the  Security  Council,  which  must  reflect  the  realities
28
and  needs  of  the  world  today.  The  Security  Council
must  be  reformed  to  be  made  more  representative,
more  democratic  and  more  effective  in  its  decision-
making  processes.  Its  membership  and  structure,
passed  down  since  1945,  are  inarguably  outdated  and
no  longer  reflect  the  political,  economic,  social  and
demographic  realities  of  our  time  or,  apparently,  the
growing issues of human security.
the  world’s  population  residing 
As  the  United  Nations  Charter  mandates  the
Security Council’s responsibility in the maintenance of
international  peace  and  security,  it  is  important  for  us
to ensure that the interests of all nations are sufficiently
reflected  in  the  Council’s  composition  and  voting
procedures.  It  is  unacceptable,  however,  that  the  two
thirds  of 
the
developing  countries  are  not  equitably  represented  in
the  Council.  Such  practices  could  jeopardize  the

that we work together to build a genuine community of

the developing countries is reduced; in which the threat
of terrorism and nuclear annihilation are eliminated; in
which  the  danger  of  a  global  HIV/AIDS  epidemic  is

come  about  only  through  the  development  of  a  more

of  a  broader  spirit  of  true  union  among  nations  in  a

world  free  of  terrorism,  a  world  of  stability,  peace,
security, development and prosperity for all peoples in

Finally, I am pleased to express, on behalf of the
Royal  Government  of  Cambodia,  our  very  warm
congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan on his re-election to
a second term in the noble post of Secretary-General. I
do  believe  that,  with  his  dedication  and  long-standing
experience  in  dealing  with  the  many  challenges  faced
by  the  United  Nations,  the  Secretary-General  will
certainly  achieve  more  success  for  the  sake  of  peace
and  stability  for  all  nations  Members  of  the  United

The  Acting  President  (spoke  in  Arabic):  I  now

Minister for Foreign Affairs of Madagascar.
Mrs.  Ratsifandriamanana  (Madagascar)  (spoke
in  French):  It  is  with  strong  feelings  that  we  return
today  to  New  York  to  find  it  still  darkened  by
mourning  yet  ever  brightened  by  the  aura  of  freedom.
New  York  is  the  capital  of  international  diplomacy,  a
crossroads of cultures and civilizations, a cosmopolitan
city  in  which  nations  co-exist.  New  York  is  a  city
whose  heart  will  forever  hold  the  memory  of  the
victims of the human folly of 11 September 2001.
To  the  people  and  Government  of  the  United
States,  under  the  enlightened  leadership  of  President
George Bush, we reiterate our deepest condolences. We
also thank them warmly for their welcome and for the
facilities placed at our disposal.
On behalf of the delegation of Madagascar, from
this  United  Nations  rostrum  I  convey  to  Mr.  Han
Seung-soo our sincerest congratulations on his election
to  the  General  Assembly  at  its  fifty-sixth  session.  To
his  predecessor,  Mr.  Harri  Holkeri,  we  pay  well-
deserved  tribute  for  the  success  of  the  Millennium
Assembly.
To  Mr.  Kofi  Annan,  Secretary-General  of  our
Organization,  we  express  our  pride  at  the  important
distinction  he  has  recently  been  awarded.  The  Nobel
Peace  Prize  that  he  has  received  is  both  a  recognition
of  his  unassailable  competence  and  dedication  as  well
as  a  reflection  of  the  value  of  the  United  Nations  and
the trust placed in it by the entire world.
Our  Organization  is  being  confronted  with  new
concerns every day. It is called on to keep up with the

Madagascar,  an  island  in  the  Indian  Ocean,  thus
far little affected by the AIDS pandemic, is nonetheless
not  indifferent  to  this  scourge.  A  strategy  and  a
programme  to  prevent  and  combat  AIDS,  within  an
established  institutional  framework,  are  being  pursued
by  all  State  and  non-State  institutions  in  the  country.
Having  participated  actively  in  the  United  Nations

the  discussions
emerged the notion that traditional cultures could serve
as a point of reference for modern nations to design a
code of peaceful behaviour. The prevention of terrorist
acts  could  also  be  complemented  by  educational  and
training  programmes  and  information  programmes  on
the culture of peace.

order  to  ensure  a  climate  of  confidence  and  calm.  We
must  have  the  courage  to  denounce  the  excesses  of

our common values.
The time has now come for dialogue. It is not too
late to become aware of the value of dialogue. Having

a dialogue does not mean tolerating misdeeds, nor does
it  mean  any  complicity  with  criminals,  who  must  be
punished.  Above  all,  having  a  dialogue  means  going
beyond  terrorism  through  a  new  understanding  of  the
concept  of  enemy.  It  is  now  time  to  hear  each  other,
with  mutual  respect and  in  a  climate  of  understanding
that  takes  the  other  into  account.  It  is  now  time  for
shared responsibilities and continued harmonization of
views for the establishment of a world of trust.

The  opening  of  the  fifty-sixth  session  of  the  General

to  take  this  opportunity  to  once  again  express  our
sincere  condolences  and  sympathy  to  the  Government
and the people of the United States and to all the other
countries directly affected by this tragedy.
The  delegation  of  Côte  d’Ivoire  is  pleased  to
extend its warm congratulations to the President on his
election to lead the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth
session.  We  would

congratulations  to  his  predecessor,  Mr.  Harri  Holkeri,

put  back  on  the  agenda  the  concerns  of  developing
countries  in  general,  including  those  of  Côte  d’Ivoire.
It  is  absolutely  vital  to  sensitize  the  international
community  on  matters  related  to  the  fight  against

throughout  the  very  difficult  times  it  has  experienced
since the end of 1999. He demonstrated this once again
by  sending  a  personal  representative  to  the  forum  on
national  reconciliation  that  is  now  under  way.  The
Government  and  the  people  of  Côte  d’Ivoire  and  the
international  community  have  great  hopes  for  that
forum,  whose  success  will  help  all  participants  to
dispel  misunderstandings  and  help  Côte  d’Ivoire  to
resume its economic growth in order to be able to play
its proper role.
My  Government  attaches  great  importance  to  a
social policy aimed at combating poverty and meeting
the needs of all sectors of our population in the areas of
health, education, employment and nutrition. As part of
that policy, a strategy document on poverty reduction is
being prepared.
Beginning  in  June  2002,  a  health  insurance  plan
will  be  in  place  as  part  of  a  national  social  security
system.  Through  that  plan  everyone  living  in  Côte

In  order  to  attain  these  various  objectives,  the
macroeconomic  framework  will  have  to  be  improved
through  rigorous  legal  and  budgetary  measures  and
through  good  governance.  Côte  d’Ivoire  is  strongly
determined to do its very best in this area.
Ensuring  the  well-being  of  children  and  the
protection  of  their  rights  is  a  priority  for  my  country.
The special session on children will take place in a few
months,  and  our  Government  places  great  hope  in  the
fact  that  it  will  give  us  an  opportunity  to  clarify  the
actions we are taking in favour of children, particularly
in the fight against cross-border trafficking in children.
Last  June,  in  this  very  Hall,  States  adopted  new
measures and initiatives in order to ensure the effective
implementation  of 
the  Beijing  Declaration  and
Platform for Action. Côte d’Ivoire endorses all of these
recommendations  and  will  do  everything  possible
within  the  framework  of  a  renewal  policy  to  reach  as
quickly as possible this objective, which is intended to
ensure equal opportunity among men and women.
The problem of HIV/AIDS has become one of the
major  concerns  of  the  world  today  in  general  and  for
Africa  in  particular.  UN/AIDS  statistics  and  those  of
many other institutions state that throughout the world
over  30  million  people  are  infected,  of  which  1.2
million are children. Africa represents only 10 per cent
of  the  planet’s  population;  nevertheless,  since  the
beginning  of  this  epidemic,  83  per  cent  of  all  deaths
due  to  AIDS  have  fallen  to  Africa.  As  the  Secretary-
General  has  rightly  stressed  in  his  report  of  16
February 2001, if the epidemic continues to grow at the
present  rate,  the  most  affected  nations  will  see  a
decrease  of  at  least  25  per  cent  of  their  estimated
economic  growth  over  the  next  20  years.  For  this
reason  we  are  very  glad  to  see  the  setting  up  of  a
Global  AIDS  and  Health  Fund  at  the  United  Nations
Secretary-General’s initiative. It would also be  a good
time to set up mechanisms promoting the exchange of
experience among those countries which have managed
to  halt  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  and  those  which  are
still seeking solutions to it.
No country can flourish if international peace and
security  are  threatened,  which  is  why  Côte  d’Ivoire  is
extremely  concerned  by  an  arms  race  which  dares  not
speak its name. As party to the Pelindaba Treaty, Côte
d’Ivoire  welcomes  the  increasing  number  of  treaties
the  end  of 
the  Second  World  War, 
The  illicit  proliferation  and  circulation  of  small
arms  is  another  phenomenon  that  affects  the  African
continent,  and  West  Africa 
in  particular.  This
phenomenon  constitutes  a  permanent  threat  to  peace
and  slows  down  development  in  this  region,  where
over 15 million light weapons are circulating illegally.
Since 
the
international  community’s  attention  has  focused  on
nuclear  arms.  However,  it  is  conventional  small  arms
that  continue  to  create  millions  of  victims.  Here  we
share the Secretary-General’s opinion expressed in his
Millennium Report: light weapons are indeed weapons
of mass destruction. They exacerbate regional conflicts
and contribute largely to the use of child soldiers. They
kill women, youth and children. The insecurity that this
creates  prohibits  any  possibility  of  smooth  economic
development.
As  Members  of  the  General  Assembly  know,  on
31 October 1998 in Abuja, Nigeria, the Heads of State
of  the  Economic  Community  of  West  African  States
(ECOWAS)  decreed  a  moratorium  aimed  at  reducing
the  proliferation  and  circulation  of  light  weapons  in
West Africa. During the recent African summit, which
took place in Lusaka in July 2001, this moratorium was
extended  for  a  three-year  period,  starting  on  5  July
2001. This struggle can be efficient only if it is led by
the  international  community  as  a  whole,  and  it  has  to
involve,  of  course,  weapons  manufacturers,  official
users and civil society. The United Nations Conference
on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons
in All Its Aspects, which was held in New York from 9
to  20  July  2001,  is  in  our  opinion  headed  in  the  right
direction.  Côte  d’Ivoire  is  greatly  interested  in  the
implementation  of  the  Programme  of  Action  adopted
by the Conference.
Eight years ago the General Assembly decided to
undertake  the  reform  of  the  Security  Council.  As  it
stands at the moment, the Council cannot be seen as a
democratic  and  representative  body  of  all  United
Nations  Member  States.  The  Council’s  functions  have
to  be  reinforced  so 
it  can  continue  acting
efficiently as the United Nations body with the primary
role of ensuring the maintenance of international peace
and  security.  In  order  to  do  this,  it  is  urgent  and  right
that  the  number  of  permanent  and  non-permanent
members  be  increased  so  that  the  composition  of  the
Council  is  in  line  with  the  complexity  of  a  world  that
that 
33
A/56/PV.47
has  seen  great  development,  both  quantitative  and
qualitative,  in  international  relations,  the  key  aspect
being  the  increased  complexity  of  the  problems  to  be
solved.
In our view, the expansion of the Council should
aim at re-adapting the whole mechanism of taking and
implementing decisions. This is why the exercise of the
right of veto, equitable representation and expansion of
membership are all problems that have to be solved as
soon  as  possible,  bearing  in  mind  the  vital  urgency  of
reforming  the  Security  Council  so  that  all  nations  and
regions of the world can be reflected within it. In this
regard,  the  Organization  of  African  Unity  (OAU),
which  has  now  become  the  African  Union,  seeks  two
permanent seats and a total of five non-permanent seats
for  the  African  continent.  Of  course,  Côte  d’Ivoire
supports this position.
to  demonstrate 
To  make  the  reform  of  the  Security  Council  a
reality, it is essential for Member States of the United
Nations,  particularly  the  five  permanent  members  of
the  Council, 
their  firm  will  and
commitment  to  carry  out  these  reforms.  The  primary
duty of the United Nations, after all, is to preserve and

At  the  dawn  of  the  twenty-first  century,  the  role
of  the  United  Nations  is  crucial.  Our  Organization
represents, in fact, the collective conscience and is, as a
rule,  the  policeman  of  the  world,  able  to  balance  the
interests of States — those well endowed and those not
so  well  endowed  —  within  the  new  globalizing
economy.  This  regulatory  role  for  the  world  economy
and  for  international  relations  can  be  carried  out  fully
only  in  an  environment  of  international  peace,  justice

The  Acting  President  (spoke  in  Arabic):  I  now
give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Fuad Mubarak Al-
Hinai, Chairman of the delegation of Oman.
Mr.  Al-Hinai  (Oman)  (spoke  in  Arabic):  I  wish
to  express  my  sincere  congratulations  to  Mr.  Han
Seung-soo  on  his  assumption  of  the  presidency  of  the
fifty-sixth  session  of  the  General  Assembly.  We  are
confident that his skills, competence and experience in
international  affairs  will  facilitate  his  task  of  leading
and enriching the work of this session and of bringing
it  to  a  successful  conclusion  with  the  desired  results.
We  assure  him  of  our  delegation’s  cooperation  in  the
attainment  of  our  shared  objectives.  We  also  want  to
express  our  sincerest  thanks  and  appreciation  to  his
predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, former Prime Minister
of the friendly country of the Republic of Finland. We
thank  him  for  his  efforts  in  directing  the  work  of  the
last  session  and  the  various  special  sessions  that  took
place during his term.
I  want  to  take  this  opportunity  to  reiterate  my
sincerest congratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr.
Kofi Annan, and to the United Nations itself on being
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. This is a well-deserved
award  and  a  mark  of  distinction  for  the  contributions
and  the  remarkable  role  played  by  the  Secretary-
General and the United Nations in the maintenance and
the strengthening of international peace and security.
On  behalf  of  my  delegation,  I  also  want  to
express  my  sincere  congratulations  to  the  Secretary-
General on being granted a second term of office at the
head of the Organization. We intend to cooperate with

The  terrible  events  of  11  September  that  struck
this city, which is host to our Organization, have been
forcefully  condemned  by  my  Government.  This  city
has  attracted  people  from  all  over  the  world  to  a
dialogue  among  civilizations  through  our  international
Organization,  and  it  therefore  deserves  to  be  a  city  of
peace, not of terror and violence. We therefore take this
opportunity 
to  express  once  again  our  sincerest
condolences  to  the  families  of  the  victims  and  to  the
friendly American people, whose sorrow we share. The
world was horrified by this dangerous turn of events —
the  terrorist  acts  that  struck  such  vital  sites  in  New
York  and  Washington,  taking  many  lives  and  leaving
great destruction in their wake.
While expressing our solidarity with the friendly
country of the United States of America in its struggle
against terrorism and in the defence of its territory and
its people, and while we understand the reasons for the
military  action  being  taken  in  Afghanistan,  it  is  our
fervent  hope  that  every  effort  will  be  made  to  spare
innocent  civilians  the  destruction  and  disasters  of  war
so  that  they  will  not  suffer  further  tragedies.  For  its
part, the international community must play its role in
protecting the Afghan people.
We must not forget the peaceful means of dealing
with  terrorism.  Every  sincere  effort  must  be  made  to
eliminate  the  scourge  of  terrorism,  which  will  destroy
civilization and all the achievements of humankind if it
is  not  firmly  confronted  and  if  its  causes  are  not
examined  and  uprooted.  We  stress  that  the  use  of
military  force  is  not  the  best  or  the  only  solution  for
A/56/PV.47

vision to prevail so that all elements of the problem can

In the midst of this tragedy, we have heard certain
opportunistic  political  circles  in  States  and  at  the
international  level  linking  terrorism  to  Islam  and
Muslims.  We  fully  and  categorically  reject  this.  Islam
is  a  religion  of  mercy  for  all,  a  religion  based  on
fraternity  and  tolerance.  Muslims  are  the  bearers  of  a
civilization, 
and
humanitarian  values.  This  is  why  the  Organization  of
the  Islamic  Conference,  at  its  extraordinary  session
held  in  Doha,  Qatar,  last  October,  totally  dissociated
itself from all terrorism and reiterated its condemnation
of  terrorism  in  all  its  forms  and  manifestations.  The
session’s  final  communiqué  reported  in  paragraph  3
that the Conference

among  peoples  of  the  world.  It  stressed  as  well
the  need  to  undertake  a  joint  effort  to  promote
dialogue and create links or contacts between the
Islamic  world  and  the  West  in  order  to  reach
mutual  understanding  and  build  bridges  of

In 
respect,  my  delegation  wishes 
this 
to
emphasize  its  categorical  rejection  of  the  calls  of  all
those  who  would  like  to  use  this  human  disaster  to
settle  old  scores  and  old  political  differences  and  to
expand the field of military action to other areas under
the pretext of fighting terrorism.
We  are  concerned  about 
the  humanitarian
situation  of  the  friendly  Afghan  people.  International
humanitarian  organizations  report  that  the  military
action taking place in Afghanistan has caused hundreds
35
A/56/PV.47
of civilian casualties, that hundreds of thousands have
been  displaced  and  that  the  civilian  population  is
experiencing  severe  living  conditions.  Humanitarian
organizations have warned that a humanitarian disaster
could  be  imminent  for  the  Afghan  people,  especially
with  the  approach  of  winter.  My  country  supports
international efforts to provide humanitarian aid to the
Afghan people, especially through the recent resolution
adopted  at  the  meeting  of  Foreign  Ministers  of  the
Conference  of  the  Islamic  Conference  with  a  view  to
creating a fund for this purpose.
The  series  of  difficult  and  painful  events  in  the
peace process in the Middle East on all its tracks and at
all  its  stages,  particularly  regarding  the  Palestinian
aspect of the question, confirms that in order to arrive
at  a  just,  comprehensive  and  lasting  peace  it  is
necessary  to  work  towards  implementing  Security
Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), as well
as  all  other  relevant  United  Nations  resolutions  that
demand 
the  withdrawal  of  Israel  from  all  Arab
territories  occupied  in  1967  and  recognition  of  the
legitimate  right  of  the  Palestinian  people  to  self-
determination  and  to  the  establishment  of  its  own
independent  State,  with  Al-Quds  al-Sharif  as 
its
capital. This is a basic, just and legitimate demand for
the  purpose  of  consolidating  the  pillars  of  peace  and
stability in the region. We express our full support for
these  just  demands  of  the  Palestinian  people  who  are
fully entitled to use all means available to them to put
an end to the Israeli occupation of their territory.
The Islamic countries also support the right of the
Palestinian  people  because  of  the  justness  of  their
cause.  Theirs  is  a  legitimate  right  recognized  and
guaranteed by all international norms and instruments.
The Sultanate of Oman invites the United Nations and
the Security Council to assume their full responsibility
to have Israel implement all relevant Security Council
and international resolutions and to stop the collective
punishment of the Palestinian people.
Following the Madrid Peace Conference, in 1991,
the region was full of hope and optimism. It seemed as
though  peace  were  becoming  a 
reality.  Many
agreements  had  been  reached,  from  Oslo  to  Sharm  el-
Sheikh,  and  all  the  parties  had  embarked  on  dialogue
with one another in circumstances that were not ideal.
Nonetheless,  despite  all  the  missteps,  peace  moved
forward,  because  peace  was  the  ultimate  goal  that
everyone eagerly sought. The Arabs believed in peace.
They had agreed to it as an irreversible strategic option
36
based  on  the  principles  of  Islam,  which  advocates
tolerance and peace, and because they were convinced
that  peace  alone  would  make  prosperity,  stability  and
development possible.
The  Sultanate  of  Oman  has  therefore  supported
every  effort,  with  a  view  to  achieving  that  much-
desired peace based on justice, fairness and the legality
of international resolutions and the principle of land for
peace.  But  Israel  deviated  from  those  principles,
inventing  its  own  concept  of  peace.  Israel  has  used
every  possible  means  of  imposing  its  own  kind  of
peace.  Israel  does  not  really  want  the  peace  that  the
world is considering. Israel wants its own special kind
of  peace.  It  wants  the  international  community  to  go
along  with  the  current  reality  —  the  occupation  of
territory,  without  giving  the  Palestinians  any  role  or  a
State. This is why violence in the region is a dynamic
of  action  and  reaction.  This  is  why  there  has  been
bloodshed  and  why  life  and  property  continue  to  be
destroyed.  Will  the  world  stand  by  and  watch  the
killing  of  innocents,  the  murder  of  the  elderly  and
children?
The  Sultanate  of  Oman  therefore  invites  the  two
sponsors  of  the  peace  process  —  the  United  States  of
America  and  the  Russian  Federation  —  and  the
Secretary-General to play their role so that the situation
can  return  to  normal  and  so  that  the  peace  process,  in
all  its  aspects,  can  be  revived  and  resumed  from  the
point where it left off.
the  negotiations, 
My Government supports the just position of the
fraternal Syrian Arab Republic. Its actions are aimed at
recovering the occupied territory of the Golan Heights
and at ensuring Israel’s withdrawal to the 4 June 1967
border.  In  our  opinion,  it  is  in  Israel’s  interest  to
resume 
the
principles  of 
international
resolutions  including Security  Council  resolutions  242
(1967) and 338 (1973), as well as the principle of land
for peace, in order to lay the foundation for peace and
security,  so  that  an  effective  partnership  can  be  built
and  a  lasting,  stable  and  viable  relationship  based  on
mutual interests among the States of the region can be
established and consolidated.
in  accordance  with 
international 
law  and 
My Government also asks Israel to work towards
the full implementation of Security Council resolution
425  (1978),  which  calls  upon  Israel  to  withdraw  from
all  Lebanese  territory.  The  Shab’a  farms  area  is  an
integral  part  of  Lebanese  territory  and  is  covered  by
that  resolution.  It  is  in  Israel’s  interest  to  withdraw
from that territory in order to broaden the prospects of
peace  and  to  strengthen  peace  and  stability,  which
everyone desires.
The 
imposition  of  sanctions  as  a  political
mechanism  means  that  Governments  must  fulfil  their
obligations  under  international  resolutions.  However,
we  see  that  this  policy  has  become  a  weapon  that
jeopardizes  the  fundamental  rights  of  peoples.  This  is
unacceptable.  Hence,  it  is  important  that  the  Security
Council  seek  effective  policies  and  mechanisms  that
take into account the extent to which resolutions have
been  implemented  by  the  countries  to  which  those
resolutions  are  addressed,  such  as  Iraq,  Libya  and
others.
Despite  all  the  serious  international  and  regional
efforts  to  relieve  the  suffering  of  the  fraternal  Iraqi
people,  we  note  that  the  overall  situation  in  Iraq  and
the future of the Iraqi people are becoming increasingly
problematic because of the economic embargo imposed
on  them  in  1990.  That  is  also  the  view  of  the
humanitarian 
and 
and
organizations in Iraq.
international 
agencies 
The Sultanate of Oman supports all efforts to lift
completely the economic sanctions against Iraq. At the
same  time,  we  call  upon  the  Iraqi  Government  to
cooperate  constructively  with  the  United  Nations  in
order  to  implement  the  remaining  relevant  Security
Council resolutions, particularly regarding prisoners of
war,  missing  Kuwaitis  and  missing  persons  from  third
States.
The  Sultanate  of  Oman  warmly  welcomes  the
wise  approach  of  our  brethren  in  Bahrain  and  Qatar.
Those  two  countries  have  proceeded  to  implement  the
Judgment  of  the  International  Court  of  Justice  of  16
March  2001.  That  positive  approach  by  those  two
fraternal  countries  has  eliminated  many  sources  of
tension  and  has  made  a  genuine  contribution  to  the
establishment  of  peace,  security  and  stability  in  the
region.
My  Government  is  gratified  by  the  friendly
official contacts between the United Arab Emirates and
the  Islamic  Republic  of  Iran,  which  will  enable  those
two countries to agree on joint means to put an end to
their  dispute  over  the  three  islands  belonging  to  the
Emirates.

The  political,  economic,  social  and  cultural

Over  the  past  30  years  of  Oman’s  development
process,  my  Government  has  constantly  worked  to
balance  development  and  environmental  protection.
Such  efforts  have  been  successful  thanks  to  His
Majesty the Sultan’s declaration of 2001 as the Year of
the Environment. In the framework of our contribution
and  of  our  interest  in  global  environmental  issues,  we
have  pledged  that  we  will  sign  all  conventions  and
treaties  aimed  at  protecting  the  Earth’s  environment.
My  country  today  appeals  to  developed  countries  to

In  the  light  of  the  importance  of  integration  into
the  world  economy,  my  country  officially  joined  the
World  Trade  Organization  on  9  November  2000.  We
hope thus to enhance the role and the level of our trade
and industrial organizations and services and to ensure
that  they  are  duly  integrated  into  world  markets.  My
country  has  undertaken  great  economic  reforms  to
liberalize  trade  and  investment.  We  have  also  enacted

many laws and have strengthened our mechanisms and
regulations in these areas.
I  should  mention  that,  on  20  December  2000  at
New  York,  the  Sultanate  of  Oman  signed  the  Rome
Statute of the International Criminal Court. We hope to
complete the ratification process and thus to accede to
this new organ of international law, which is aimed at
bringing to justice those who violate human rights and
commit  crimes  against  humanity,  wherever  they  may

report on the work of the Organization (A/56/1). It sets

discusses 
the  Millennium

must  be  ready  now  to  endorse  visions  that  would
strengthen the United Nations and restructure it in line
with current realities. That includes enlargement of the
Security  Council  in  a  manner  proportionate  to  the
overall membership of the international community. In
that  way  the  Organization  can  serve  as  an  effective

The  Acting  President  (spoke  in  Arabic):  A
number  of  representatives  have  asked  to  speak  in
exercise  of  the  right  of  reply.  Before  calling  on  those
representatives,  I  wish  to  recall  that,  in  accordance
with  decision  34/401,  statements  in  right  of  reply  are
limited  to  10  minutes  for  the  first  intervention  and  to
five  minutes  for  the  second  and  should  be  made  by
delegations from their seats.
Mr.  Eldon  (United  Kingdom):  I  should  like  to
speak  briefly  in  exercise  of  the  right  of  reply  to  the
remarks  about  the  Chagos  archipelago  made  today  by
the  Prime  Minister  of  Mauritius.  The  British
Government  maintains  that  the  British  Indian  Ocean
Territory  is  British  and  that  it  has  been  since  1814.  It
does  not  recognize  the  sovereignty  claim  of  the
Government of Mauritius.

However, the British Government has recognized
Mauritius as the only State which has a right to assert a
claim  of  sovereignty  when 
the  United  Kingdom
relinquishes  its  own  sovereignty.  Successive  British
Governments  have  given  undertakings 
the
Government  of  Mauritius  that  the  Territory  will  be
ceded  when  it  is  no  longer  required  for  defence
purposes,  subject  to  the  requirements  of  international
to
law.  The  British  Government 
remains  open 
discussions  regarding  arrangements  governing 
the
British  Indian  Ocean  Territory  or  the  future  of  the
Territory.  The  British  Government  has  stated  that,
when  the  time  comes  for  the  Territory  to  be  ceded,  it
will  engage  in  close  liaison  with  the  Government  of
Mauritius.
Finally,  the  British  Government  values  its  close
and  constructive  cooperation  with  the  Government  of
Mauritius on a wide range of issues, and looks forward
to that cooperation continuing.
Mr. Aldouri  (Iraq)  (spoke 
in  Arabic):  My
delegation  has  asked  to  exercise  its  right  of  reply  to
clarify  and  correct  some  of  the  information  in  the
statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and
Acting  Prime  Minister  of  the  State  of  Kuwait.  My
delegation would like to say the following.
First,  the  Acting  Prime  Minister  of  the  State  of
Kuwait  stated  that  his  country  was  under  constant
threats to its security and sovereignty. We would like to
make  it  clear  to  the  General  Assembly  that  since  the
ceasefire, Iraq has made no threats against Kuwait. We
would  like  to  remind  the  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs
of  Kuwait  that  Iraq  is  under  constant  attack  by
American  and  British  planes,  and  these  attacks  have
claimed  many  victims,  including  innocent  civilians.
This  military  aggression  is  launched  from  Kuwaiti
land,  waters  and  airspace.  These  daily  attacks  are
documented by the United Nations. Therefore, Kuwait
and the other aggressive States must shoulder their full
international responsibilities. Iraq reserves its juridical
right to ask for compensation as a result of its constant
losses, in accordance with international liability law.
Secondly,  as  regards  missing  persons,  everyone
knows  that  Iraq  has  often  stated  that  no  Kuwaiti  or
non-Kuwaiti  prisoners  of  war  can  be  found  within  its
borders. In fact, Iraq freed all Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti
prisoners  of  war  as  soon  as 
the  ceasefire  was
established  under  Security  Council  resolution  687
(1991). This resolution also covered the freeing of Iraqi
prisoners  of  war,  which  was  one  of  the  ceasefire
conditions. That is why Iraq had no interest in keeping
any Kuwaiti or non-Kuwaiti prisoners of war.

Iraq  asks  Kuwait  to  no  longer  politicize  the
question  of  missing  Kuwaiti  prisoners  of  war.  This
matter  should  be  settled  through  bilateral  negotiations
or  under  the  aegis  of  the  Arab  League.  Through  the
Assembly,  I  would  also  like  to  appeal  again  to  our

Assembly  that  Iraq  has  provided  over  1,042  files  on
missing  Iraqi  civilian  and  military  personnel  to  the
intermediary of the International Committee of the Red
Cross.  The  Government  of  Kuwait,  however,  has
provided us with no information on the missing Iraqis.
For the same humanitarian reasons cited by the Acting
Prime Minister of Kuwait, we would like to ask Kuwait

Kuwait 
is  obviously
erroneous,  as  stated  by  Acting  Prime  Minister  Sheikh
Eabah al-Ahmad. He stated that there had in fact been
many  declarations  threatening  and  undermining  the
security  and  sovereignty  of  Kuwait,  and  this  has  been
borne out by many of Iraq’s recent activities. Iraq has
refused to renew the commitment on the independence,
security  and  sovereignty  of  Kuwait,  which  led  to  the
Arab Summit’s lack of success. Kuwait has sent many
letters  to  the  Security  Council  alerting  it  to  various
statements, 
those  by  President  Saddam
Hussein,  and  these  letters  have  been  published  as
official documents of the United Nations.
including 
It seems to me that what Iraq has said concerning
American  and  British  planes  is  a  question  of  the  no-
flight zones. As for support for these flights, the zones
were  set  up  to  ensure  Iraq’s  commitment  to  abide  by
Security  Council  resolution  687  (1991).  There  is  an
agreement  between  Iraq  and  the  coalition  countries
concerning  ceasefire  arrangements.  According  to  its
terms, these planes are to fly over Iraq and do not need
to be based in Kuwait or anywhere else. A number of
A/56/PV.47
aircraft  carriers  off  Kuwait  are  available  to  support
such  flights.  Therefore,  we  reject  such  allegations  and
would like to ask Iraq to abide by all its commitments
to  relevant  Security  Council  resolutions.  Only  in  this
way  can  we  achieve  the  general  objective  of  ensuring
peace and stability in this vital region.
As  to  prisoners  of  war  and  missing  persons,  we
are  very  sorry  to  hear  what  Iraq  has  said  on  this
subject.  It  is  by  no  means  new;  we  have  heard  such
erroneous  information  before.  For  over  10  years  now,
since  the  liberation  of  Kuwait,  Iraq  has  not  complied
with the relevant resolutions on this subject, including
resolutions  687  (1991)  and  1284  (1999).  A  number  of
presidential  press  statements  were  made  during  the
Tripartite  Commission  meeting  asking  Iraq  to  settle
this question and to cooperate with Mr. Yuli Vorontsov,
the high-level Coordinator of the Secretary-General on
this  matter.  Unfortunately,  Iraq  has  not  yet  responded
to  those  statements.  We  hope  that  the  Government  of
Iraq  will  change  its  position  on  this  matter  and  not
subject it to any political concessions.
The  representative  of  Iraq  has  pointed  out  that
Kuwait  has  to  settle  this  matter  through  bilateral
negotiations or through the League of Arab States. We
have  in  fact  rejected  that  Iraqi  proposal  because  it
establishes unnecessary mechanisms. There are already
international  mechanisms  in  existence,  namely,  the
International  Committee  of  the  Red  Cross  and  the
Tripartite  Commission  headed  by 
the  high-level
Coordinator  appointed  by  the  Secretary-General  in
accordance  with  resolution  1284  (1999),  Mr.  Yuli
Vorontsov. The basic objective of the Iraqi proposal is
to  take  this  humanitarian  issue  outside  the  Security
Council framework and to further delay a resolution of
this matter.
With regard to missing Iraqi persons, we wish to
say the following. If the Iraqi Government were indeed
serious  about  discovering  the  fate  of  those  missing
persons,  why  does  it  not  participate  in  the  process  set
up by the Red Cross and the Tripartite Commission in

Kuwait  had  to  submit  to  Iraqi  occupation,  and
this is just a way of diverting attention from that fact.

appeal to Kuwait to resolve bilaterally the question of

well  known.  In  my  first  statement  in  exercise  of  the
right of reply, I said that Kuwait refuses to create any
new  mechanisms 
this  humanitarian
problem.  If  Iraq  were  really  serious  and  sincere,  it
would  cooperate  with  the  International  Committee  of
the  Red  Cross  and  would  participate  in  its  meetings.
Why  does  Iraq  not  cooperate  with  the  high-level
Coordinator  appointed  by  the  Secretary-General  for
that  purpose?  Why  create  new  mechanisms?  I  have
already  said  that  the  reason  Iraq  has  tried  to  take  this
issue  outside 
framework  of  United  Nations
resolutions is because it wants to weaken the issue and
delay  the  resolution  of  the  matter.  If  Iraq  really  is
sincere,  why  should  we  create  a  new  international
mechanism?

Finally, I would like to reaffirm what the Acting
Prime Minister of Kuwait said in his statement. All that
we  ask  of  Iraq  is  for  it  to  implement  the  relevant
resolutions  of  the  Security  Council.  This  has  been
called  for  not  only  in  the  United  Nations,  but  also  at

Mr.  Aldouri  (Iraq)  (spoke  in  Arabic):  I  repeat
once again that Iraq has never threatened Kuwait. It is
in  the  interest  of  Iraq  to  see  stability  and  security
prevail  in  the  region.  It  is  also  in  the  interest  of  the
Arab countries.
The  question  of  the  no-flight  zones  has  already
been  dealt  with  and  resolved  through  several  United
Nations  resolutions  and  by  the  Secretary-General.
Statements  have  been  made  to  the  effect  that  such
zones  are  not  based  on  any  resolution  of  the  Security
Council,  and  are  thus  established  in  violation  of
Council  resolutions  and  constitute  an  attack  on  Iraq.
Therefore  any  facilities  provided  by  Kuwait  to  the
aggressors’  planes  are  in  violation  of  the  Charter.
Kuwait  is  responsible  for  that  under  international  law,
as are the aggressor countries.
My Government reiterates its sincere invitation to
Kuwait 
to  begin  direct  bilateral  negotiations  or
negotiations under the auspices of the Arab League to
take up the issue of missing Kuwaitis and Iraqis. Iraq is
prepared  to  begin  such  negotiations  immediately  in
order to resolve this matter on a humanitarian basis.
Mr.  Al-Otaibi  (Kuwait)  (spoke  in  Arabic):  I  am
sorry  for  taking  the  floor  once  again.  I  shall  be  very
brief.
I shall not repeat what has already been said with
regard to the no-flight zones. But, with respect to Iraq’s
