Agenda item 15 (continued)
Election to fill vacancies in principal organs
(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic
and Social Council
The  President: The  General  Assembly  will  now
proceed to the election of 18 members of the Economic
and  Social  Council  to  replace  those  members  whose
term of office expires on 31 December 2002.
The  18  outgoing  members  are:  Angola,  Austria,
Bahrain,  Benin,  Burkina  Faso,  Cameroon,  Costa  Rica,
Croatia,  Cuba,  Fiji,  France,  Germany,  Japan,  Malta,
Mexico, Spain, the Sudan and Suriname.
As  of  1  January  2003,  the  following  States  will
continue to be represented on the Economic and Social
Council: Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Bhutan, Brazil,
Burundi,  Chile,  China,  Egypt,  El  Salvador,  Ethiopia,
Finland,  Georgia,  Ghana,  Guatemala,  Hungary,  India,
the  Islamic  Republic  of  Iran,  Italy,  the  Libyan  Arab
Jamahiriya,  Nepal,  the  Netherlands,  Nigeria,  Pakistan,
Peru,  Qatar,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Romania,  the
Russian  Federation,  South  Africa,  Sweden,  Uganda,
Ukraine,  the  United  Kingdom  of  Great  Britain  and
Northern  Ireland,  the  United  States  of  America  and
Zimbabwe.
The names of these 36 States should therefore not
appear on the ballots.
In  accordance  with  paragraph  4  of  General
Assembly  resolution  2847  (XXVI)  of  20  December
1971, and taking into account the number of States that
will  remain  members  of  the  Council  after  1  January
2003,  the  18  members  should  be  elected  as  follows:
five from African States, three from Asian States, one
from  Eastern  European  States,  four 
from  Latin
American and Caribbean States and five from Western
European  and  other  States.  The  ballot  papers  reflect
this pattern.
I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  those
candidates,  their  number  not  exceeding  the  number  of
seats  to  be  filled,  who  receive  the  greatest  number  of
votes and a two-thirds majority of members present and
voting,  will  be  declared  elected.  In  the  case  of  a  tie
vote  for  a  remaining  seat,  there  will  be  a  restricted
2
ballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an
equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to
that procedure?
It was so decided.
The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the
rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret
ballot, and there shall be no nominations.
Regarding candidatures, I have been informed by
the Chairman of the respective regional groups that for
the  five  vacant  seats  from  among  the  African  States,
there  are  five  endorsed  candidates,  namely  Benin,  the
Congo, Kenya, Mozambique and Senegal.
For the three vacant seats from among the Asian
there  are  five  candidates,  namely  Japan,
States, 
Lebanon, Malaysia, Mongolia and Saudi Arabia.
For  the  one  vacant  seat  from  among  the  Eastern
European  States,  there  is  one  endorsed  candidate,
namely Azerbaijan.
For  the  four  vacant  seats  from  among  the  Latin
four
American  and  Caribbean  States, 
endorsed  candidates,  namely  Cuba,  Ecuador,  Jamaica
and Nicaragua.
there  are 
For the five vacant seats from among the Western
European  and  other  States,  there  are  five  endorsed
candidates,  namely  France,  Germany,  Greece,  Ireland
and Portugal.
In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of
procedure,  we  shall  now  proceed  to  the  election  by
secret ballot.
Before we begin the voting process, I should like
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting.
I  should  like  to  seek  the  usual  cooperation  of
representatives  during  the  time  of  the  conduct  of  the
election.  Please  be  reminded  that,  during  the  voting
process,  all  campaigning  should  cease  in  the  General
Assembly Hall. This means in particular that, once the
voting  has  begun,  no  more  campaign  material  can  be
distributed inside the Hall. All representatives are also
requested  to  remain  at  their  seats  so  that  the  voting
process can proceed in an orderly manner.
We shall now begin the voting process.
Ballot papers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E”
will now be distributed. I request representatives to use
only  those  ballot  papers  and  to  write  on  them  the
names of States for which they wish to vote.
May  I  ask  representatives  to  write  on  the  ballot
papers marked “A” for the African States the names of
the  five  States  for  which  they  wish  to  vote,  on  the
ballot  papers  marked  “B”  for  the  Asian  States  the
names  of  the  three  States  for  which  they  vote,  on  the
ballot  papers  marked  “C”  for  the  Eastern  European
States the name of the one State for which they wish to
vote,  on  the  ballot  papers  marked  “D”  for  the  Latin
American  and  Caribbean  States  the  names  of  the  four
States  for  which  they  wish  to  vote  and  on  the  ballot
papers marked “E” for the Western European and other
States the names of the five States for which they wish
to vote.
A  ballot  paper  containing  more  names  from  the
relevant region than the number of seats assigned to it
will be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a
b0allot paper that do not belong to that region will not
be counted at all.
At  the  invitation  of  the  President,  Mr.  Babikir
(Chad),  Ms.  Crichlow  (Guyana),  Mr.  Cajuste
(Haiti),  Mr.  Terrazzani  (Monaco),  Mrs.  Garcia
(Philippines)  and  Mr.  Staszak  (Poland)  acted  as
tellers.
A vote was taken by secret ballot.
