Report of the Secretary-General on the work of the
Organization (A/57/1)
Mr.  Lancry  (Israel): I  wish  to  congratulate  the
Secretary-General for his annual report on the work of
the  Organization  and 
the
implementation of the Millennium Declaration. It is no
coincidence  that,  under  his  able  stewardship,  both  he
and  the  Organization  were  awarded  the  Nobel  Peace
Prize.  This  distinction  is  a  tribute  —  but  it  is  also  a
challenge.

The challenge, however, is to deal coherently and
cooperatively  with  the  subject  matter  of  the  twenty-
first  century:  globalization  and  interdependence.  We
wish  to  reap  the  benefits  of  globalization,  but  also  to
avoid its pitfalls. The advantages of progress cannot —
and must not — be attained at the cost of ignoring the
rights of others to development, or by disregarding our
increasingly  fragile  planetary  ecosystem.  The  dangers
are great, but the rewards are even greater.
Whereas this Organization dealt comprehensively
with the spectres of the twentieth century, those of the
twenty-first  century  still  loom  before  us.  As  the
unthinkable became reality just one short year ago, we
realized  that,  as  the  danger  of  traditional  war  recedes,
we  must  face  the  new  realities  of  terrorism.  My
country,  unfortunately,  has  had  bitter  experience  as  a
victim  of  terrorism  since  before  we  established  our
independence;  today,  the  world  stands  united  in  its
condemnation of terror in whatever form, regardless of
cause or grievance.
Much  has  been  said  about  the  root  causes  of
terrorism.  I  must,  however,  refer  to  what  my  Deputy
Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs  so
aptly stated from this rostrum just a few weeks ago, on
18  September:  “Terror  creates  poverty  more  than
poverty creates terror.” This is the unfortunate truth we
must  face.  The  international  community  must  remain
vigilant; it must continue to fight the manifestations of
evil  wherever  they  are  found,  where  they  breed  and
multiply  and  receive  succour  and  assistance.  States
must be held to account for the assistance they provide
to the machinery of evil.

At  the  same  time,  we  must  keep  one  eye  firmly
on 
the  Millennium  Development  Goals, 
the
achievement  of  which  would  go  a  long  way  towards
draining  the  swamp  in  which  terrorism  feeds.  Israel
participated  fully  in  the  landmark  meetings  at  Doha,
Monterrey  and  Johannesburg,  and  looks  forward  to
taking  an  active  role  in  the  implementation  of  their
conclusions.

Barely  10  years  after  the  State  of  Israel  was
founded,  we  realized 
in  spite  of  our  own
development needs, we were in duty bound to share our
experiences  with 
countries.
MASHAV — 
International
Development  Cooperation  —  places  emphasis  on
capacity-building  and  sustainability  in  those  fields
deemed to be most critical in the development process.
It  is  no  coincidence  that  those  fields  mirror  those  the
Secretary-General  noted  as  paramount:  water,  energy,
health, agriculture and biodiversity.
In  2001  alone,  more 
than  8,000  people
participated  in  230  courses,  in  addition  to  more  than
200  long-term  and  short-term  consultancies  the  world
over.  Special  emphasis  is  placed  on  the  empowerment
of  women,  encouraging  self-sufficiency  and  economic
independence.
in 
the  creation  of, 
Israel  has  been  active  not  only  in  cooperation
with,  but  also 
international
frameworks in priority areas. Everyone involved in the
mechanisms of the Convention on Biological Diversity
and  the  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  is
aware  of  the  contributions  made  by  Israel  towards
strengthening those multilateral frameworks.
The HIV/AIDS pandemic is a further example of
the  necessity  of  concerted,  global  efforts  to  meet  the
Millennium  Goals.  Besides  the  critically  important
research  and  development  being  conducted  in  Israel
and  in  other  centres  around  the  world,  action  at  the
grass-roots  level  is  no  less  important.  The  African
continent  has  been  hardest  hit  by  this  modern-day
plague. It is in this context that we wish to congratulate
the courage and foresight of African leaders in creating
two  frameworks  —  the  African  Union  and  the  New
Partnership  for  Africa’s  Development  —  to  face  these
challenges  head-on  in  a  spirit  of  partnership,  rather
than in one of dependence. Israel remains committed to
cooperating  with  Africa  and  to  working  in  close
partnership  with 
relevant  actors  and  specialized
2
agencies  to  ensure  the  success  of  this  ambitious  new
programme.
Under  the  leadership  of  the  Secretary-General,
the  United  Nations  has  begun  the  sometimes  painful,
but  always  necessary,  process  of 
reform  and
restructuring. Much has been done and still needs to be
done to craft this Organization into the body it aspires
to be: a forum for the promotion of peace, a bastion of
freedom  and  development,  and  a  guardian  of  our
planet’s resources. Israel is committed to working hand
in hand, in a spirit of friendship and cooperation, with
our  partners,  nations  and  United  Nations  bodies  alike,
to formulate a collective response to the challenges of
the new millennium for the benefit of all the peoples of
the world.
Mr.  Fall  (Senegal)  (spoke 
in  French):  The
relevant  reports  we  have  received  from  the  Secretary-
General give us once again this year the full measure of
the  complexity  of  the  tasks  we  face  and  the  extent  of
the challenges we have to take up. We therefore remain
firmly  convinced,  as  ever,  that  multilateral  action,
which is the raison d’être of the United Nations, must
today,  more  than  ever  before,  remain  the  foundation,
the  driving  force  and  the  bastion  of  our  ideals,  the
direction  we  take  and  the  foreign  policy  choices  we
make.
Here  we  are,  gathered  together  once  again,  to
seek  and  identify  ideal  consensus  solutions  to  the
Herculean tasks facing us. Since the tragic events of 11
September 2001, it has become clear that no unilateral
action, however well founded, can in itself put an end
to  the  unspeakable  monster  of  international  terrorism
or  of  its  despicable  surrogate,  organized  transnational
crime.
Similarly, only by acting together can we stop the
rapid  spread  of  HIV/AIDS,  to  take  control  over  the
continuing  deterioration  of 
to
annihilate  the  proliferation  of  inter-  and  intra-State
conflicts, to reduce the enormous digital divide, to cut
off the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, to
eradicate the trafficking in human beings and to resolve
so many other ills and calamities.
the  environment, 
All 
those  obstacles  and  crippling  handicaps
represent  grave  threats  to  international  peace,  security
and  stability.  But  even  worse,  there  is  also  a  danger
that  they  may  irremediably  jeopardize  the  future
survival  of  humanity  as  a  whole  and,  above  all,  the
land of Lumumba, Nasser, Nkrumah, Nyerere, Senghor
and Mandela.
Over the past year, African issues have occupied
a  major  place  on  the  United  Nations  agenda.  This
means  that  Africa  continues  to  be  seen  as  a  continent
where  armed  conflict  and  humanitarian  disasters
continue, where poverty and HIV/AIDS are increasing,
where  accidental  and  other  disasters  are  spreading,
where  official  development  assistance  is  decreasing,
where the excessive debt burden grows heavier, where
foreign  direct 
is  waning,  and  where
institutional problems are preventing the private sector
and  civil  society 
from  developing,  as  well  as
preventing the promotion of women’s rights.
investment 
Independent  evaluation  of  the  United  Nations
New  Agenda  for  the  Development  of  Africa  in  the
1990s  (UN-NADAF)  shows  that  the  objectives  set
jointly  and  agreed  for  Africa  have  not  been  achieved,
even though, over that period, Africa has been a theatre
for courageous reforms undertaken by Governments in
the  areas  of  economic  and  political  good  governance,
human rights and the rule of law.
The  outcome  anticipated  by  the  international
community  continues  to  falter  as  it  tries  to  rise  to  the
level of legitimate expectations. Drawing lessons from
unsuccessful  attempts  —  if  not  outright  failures  —  to
implement  the  innumerable  plans  and  strategies  for
Africa, African leaders launched, alongside the African
Union,  the  New  Partnership  for  Africa’s  Development
(NEPAD).  The  enthusiasm  and  mass  support  that  this
unprecedented initiative has  already garnered, because
it  was  conceived  by  and  for  Africans,  should  lead  to
resolute,  concrete  and  consistent  action  by 
the
international  community,  in  particular  the  developed
countries and partner institutions.
in  order 
Now  that  the  stage  is  set,  the  goals  proclaimed
and the means identified, we must move from words to
deeds 
to  meet  Africa’s  special  needs.
Henceforth,  all  efforts  at  peace  and  all  development
initiatives  taken  by  the  United  Nations  system  for  the
benefit  of  Africa  should  be  directed  towards  this
paramount  goal  and  should  be  a  part  of  the  strategic
and  operational  priorities  laid  down  in  NEPAD  and
which,  in  fact,  are  consistent  with  those  set  at  the
Millennium Summit.
From  that  standpoint,  it  bears  recalling  that  the
specific  goals  for  Africa  set  forth  in  the  Millennium
regional  and

subregional mechanisms for conflict prevention and the
promotion  of  political  stability,  including  the  African
Union’s  Peace  and  Security  Council  and  the  NEPAD
Peer  Review  Mechanism.  These  objectives  focus  on
special  measures  for  poverty  eradication  and  the
achievement  of  sustainable  development,  among  other
things,  by  cancelling  debt,  broadening  the  enhanced
Heavily 
(HIPC)  Debt
Initiative,  improving  access  to  markets,  increasing
official  development  assistance  and  foreign  direct
investment flows, enhancing the transfer of technology,
and the strengthening African capacities to prevent the
spread HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases.
Indebted  Poor  Countries 
As  we  can  see  from  the  Secretary-General’s
report, these goals are taking time to come to fruition.
Therefore Senegal believes that the  implementation  of
the Millennium Declaration, which is our breviary and
road map, remain an absolute priority and a categorical
imperative  for  the  Organization.  It  cannot  be  delayed,
put off or set aside. It must remain even when it comes
under  the  threat  of  being  overtaken  by  more  pressing
current issues. Because this Millennium Declaration, as
so  rightly  underlined  by  Mr.  Kofi  Annan,  is  the
expression  of  the  common  aspiration  of  the  Member
States of the United Nations for a peaceful, prosperous
and just world in which all people can live in a secure
environment.
My  government  welcomed  the  initiatives  of  the
Secretary-General  and  the  Organization  that  focus  on
the  indicators  and  data  which  make  it  possible  to
measure  progress 
the
Millennium  Declaration.  It  is  important  from  this
vantage point to strengthen cooperation with the United
Nations,  regional  and  sub-regional  organizations,  in
particular  with 
regard 
the  prevention  and
management of conflicts.

In this respect the United Nations should continue
to cooperate with Member States and non-State  actors
in  providing  better  coordination  of  assistance  and
protection  for  civilian  populations  in  situations  of
armed conflicts. Sustained attention should be given to
the  post-conflict  rebuilding  of  countries  devastated  by
war,  and  here  I  refer  to  Guinea  Bissau  and  certain
countries  in  the  Manu  River  Basin  as  well  as  in  the
Great Lakes subregion and to further supporting efforts
of  disarmament  and  demobilization  as  well  as  the
reintegration  into  society  of  ex-combatants,  especially
child soldiers, into civil life.

better life on a common planet.
Acting  President:  I  now  give  the  floor  to  the
representative of Ethiopia.
Mr. Teruneh Zenna (Ethiopia): We commend the
Secretary-General  for  his  analytical  and  balanced
reports  on  the  Implementation  of  the  Millennium
Declaration and on the Work of the Organization. The
report  on 
the  Millennium
Declaration  has  shown  us  where  we  stand  and  the
problems that need to be addressed in order to meet the
Millennium Development Goals.
the  Implementation  of 
The  Secretary-General’s  report  enumerates  our
achievements  in  maintaining  peace  and  security  in
many  parts  of  the  world,  including  Africa,  where  we
were  able  to  find  solutions  for  a  number  of  inter-  and
intra-State  conflicts  because,  among  other  things,  the
United  Nations  worked  in  collaboration  with  the
Organisation  of  African  Unity  (OAU)  and  other
regional organizations. In this regard, we commend the
plans  of 
the
existing relations between the two organizations in the
light  of  the  evolution  of  the  OAU  into  the  African
Union.
the  Secretary-General 
to  strengthen 
Ethiopia  highly  values  peace  and  security,
because  without  it,  we  cannot  fight  the  poverty  and
disease that are ravaging the continent. Ethiopia, with a
population  of  65  million  people,  has  a  great  stake  in
promoting  the  causes  of  peace  and  security  in  the
region.  That  is  why  we  readily  accepted  the  Ethio-
Eritrean Border Commission’s  ruling, and we  are now
doing  our  best,  together  with  other  member  countries
of  the  Intergovernmental  Authority  on  Development
(IGAD), to build peace in the subregion.
in  meeting 
It  would  be  difficult  to  find  lasting  solutions  to
conflicts  unless  we  address  the  root  cause  of  the
problem. The report of the Secretary-General indicates
that  much  of  sub-Saharan  Africa  and  large  parts  of
Central  Asia  are  falling  behind 
the
Millennium Development Goals. We all know that not
enough  is  being  done  to  avert  this  negative  trend.
Despite the continued commitment of donor countries,
official development assistance declined for about two
decades  as  a  percentage  of  gross  national  product,
reaching its lowest level ever at 0.22 per cent in 2001.
Only five countries met the 0.7 per cent target in 2001,
while others gave as little as 0.1 per cent of their gross
domestic product.
sustainability, 
Regarding  debt 
the  Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries  Debt  Initiative  has  been  very
slow in its implementation. World commodities prices,
such as those for coffee, have plunged in recent years,
thereby  further  aggravating  the  deteriorating  terms  of
trade.  The  report  states  that,  as  a  result,  we  are
confronting  a  world  divided  between  rich  and  poor  as
never  before  in  human  history.  Unless  we  overcome
this  unhealthy  dichotomy,  the  future  of  world  peace
and stability will be in great danger.
Besides  dehumanizing  poverty,  natural  disasters
have brought severe suffering to  millions  of  people  in
the developing countries. In recent years, the frequency
and  severity  of  drought  have  intensified,  especially  in
eastern  and  southern  Africa,  creating  chronic  food
shortages  in  the  region.  The  combined  effects  of  bad
weather,  desertification,  declining  soil  fertility,  poor
transportation,  insufficient  investment  in  agriculture,
deteriorating  terms  of  trade,  uncontrolled  population
growth  and  bad  Government  policy  have  all  played  a
role in worsening food shortages in the region. To avert
the  impending  food  crises  in  Africa,  great  emphasis
should be placed on launching a frontal attack on such
factors as recurrent drought and desert encroachment in
affected  countries 
irrigation  systems  and
continued afforestation.
through 
The problem of famine we are confronting is not
only associated with shortages of  food, but is also the
effect  of  the  lack  of  income  and  purchasing  power  of
the affected population. Therefore, any policy aimed at
eliminating  hunger  should  also  seek 
to  create
alternative  off-farm  employment  for  the  rural  poor.  In
this regard, we fully agree with the Secretary-General’s
assertion that
A/57/PV.26
“the  range  of  current  crises  has  demanded  a
flexible,  strategic  and  system-wide  response
linking  the  provision  of  emergency  assistance  to
the  search  for  sustainable  solutions”.  (A/57/1,
para. 73)
In this regard, we think it is imperative, in the light of
the present and recurrent drought in the region, that the
Secretary-General  invigorate  the  initiative  he  took  in
2000 to address the long-term problem of food security,
agricultural development and related aspects.
In  Ethiopia,  the  centrepiece  of  our  development
policy  is  agriculture-based  industrialization.  The  main
goal  of  the  policy  is  to  eliminate  the  chronic  food
shortage and to enhance the overall development of the
country  by  increasing  productivity  in  agriculture,  on
which  80  per  cent  of  the  population  depends  for  its
livelihood.
Besides  poverty,  diseases  such  as  HIV/AIDS  are
threatening  the  very  survival  of  our  countries.  We
appreciate the effort of the Secretary-General in setting
up the special Fund to help us fight the pandemic. We
are  encouraged  by  concrete  measures  being  taken  by
the  United  Nations,  its  specialized  agencies  and  the
World Bank to mitigate the onslaught of HIV/AIDS in
Africa.

non-governmental
organizations are working together to fight the disease.
Notwithstanding  this  effort,  we  realize  that  we  have  a
long  way  to  go  to  arrest  the  onslaught,  but  with  the
concerted  efforts  of  the  Ethiopian  people  and  the
assistance  of  the  international  community,  we  can
overcome  the  human  suffering  caused  by  poverty  and
diseases.

for 
at 
It is clear that the issues of peace and security are
the  key  prerogatives  of 
this  Organization.  My
delegation  fully  understands  that  it  is  the  primary
responsibility  of  the  United  Nations  and  the  Security
Council  to  maintain  international  peace  and  security.
However,  a  successful  strategy  for  preventing  armed
conflict  and  for  building  peace  requires  collective
attention and effort in addressing the challenges facing
the  international  community.  We  must  reject  double
standards.  We  must  opt  for  justice  and  impartiality  in
our  approach  to  the  various  issues  within  the  United
Nations.  Similarly,  all  Member  States  —  the  United
States  above  all  —  should  repudiate  once  and  for  all
the  policy  of  issuing  threats  to  the  sovereignty  of
countries,  interfering  in  the  internal  affairs  of  States,
artificially triggering crises and fuelling conflicts in the
service of their selfish narrow interests.
We  must  also  reinforce  the  primary  role  of  the
United Nations and international law in dealing with all
perils, including poverty, terrorism, disease and armed
conflict.
The  Secretary-General  has 
its  genuine  and  sincere  willingness 
reported  on  his
conversations with the Iraqi Government on the return
of  arms  inspectors  to  Iraq.  My  Government  has
displayed 
to
implement  all  relevant  Security  Council  resolutions
and  to  dispel  any  doubts  about  whether  it  possesses
weapons of mass destruction. It has done so in order to
reach a comprehensive settlement leading to the lifting
of  economic  sanctions  against  my  country;  to  end
6
interference  in  our  internal  affairs;  to  free  the  Middle
East of weapons of mass destruction; and to put an end
to the no-flight zones.
and 
Taking  all  of  that  into  consideration,  Iraq  has
been  willing  to  accept  the  unconditional  return  of
United  Nations  arms  inspectors.  The  negotiations  that
took place in Vienna on 30 September and 1 October of
this  year  were  successful.  We  were  able  to  make
arrangements for the resumption of inspections in Iraq.
Despite  the  success  of  those  negotiations  and  Iraq’s
unconditional  acceptance  of  the  return  of  inspectors,
the  American  Administration 
the  British
Government  have  persisted  in  their  diplomatic  and
misinformation  campaign  aimed  at  sabotaging  those
efforts and preventing the return of inspection teams to
Iraq.  They  have  striven  to  get  the  Security  Council  to
adopt a new resolution with new impossible conditions
in order to create a legal pretext for invading Iraq and
seizing its oil and for increasing tension throughout the
Middle East. The motives of the British and the United
States  are  very  clear.  They  are  creating  a  major
precedent  in  international  relations  and  are  acting  in
flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations,
which  guarantees  peace  and  security,  the  rule  of  law
and  equal  sovereignty  of  all  states.  Those  are  the
founding principles of the Organization and have been
reaffirmed  on  many  occasions,

Millennium Summit.

community and the General Assembly itself need to be
reminded of the suffering caused to the Iraqi people by
the  economic  blockade,  which  has  been  overlooked.
The report of the Secretary-General indicates that relief
from  sanctions  greatly  depends  on  Iraq’s  compliance
with all the relevant Security Council resolutions. The
Security  Council  adopted  resolution  1409  (2002)  to
relieve  the  humanitarian  situation,  but  it  has  not
achieved anything on the ground. Those who presented
that resolution claimed that its purpose was to ease the
embargo  and  to  give  Iraq  access  to  humanitarian
products. Unfortunately, the results have been negative.
The time period that the Office of the Iraq Programme
requires  to  deal  with  a  contract  was  previously  only
two  working  days.  It  has  now  become  ten  working
days. It takes at least ten days for the experts of United
Nations  Monitoring,  Verification  and 
Inspection
Commission 
International
Atomic  Energy  Agency  (IAEA)  to  examine  contracts.
If everything goes well, the process can take as long as
(UNMOVIC)  and 
the 
three  weeks.  But  if  IAEA  or  UNMOVIC  requests
additional information, the process can take as long as
six months. The purpose of resolution 1409 (2002) was
to  bring  wheat  and  other  foodstuffs  and  medicines,
such  as  anti-cancer  drugs,  into  the  country.  Such
products  were  supposed  to  go  systematically  and
directly  through  the  Office  of  the  Iraq  Programme.
They  were  not  supposed  to  be  subjected  to  the  same
kind  of  scrutiny  as  potential  dual-use  products  and
equipment are.
We  are  still  awaiting  the  acceptance  by  the
Security  Council  Committee  established  pursuant  to
resolution 661 (1990) of the list of goods requested by
Iraq,  subject  to  UNMOVIC  and  IAEA  scrutiny.  It  has
not yet been finalized.
We  see  that  the  suspended  contracts  have  once
again  been  postponed  to  15  October  2002.  This  is  in
addition  to  the  destructive  role  played  by  the  United
Kingdom  and  the  United  States  in  the  Sanctions
Committee.  Those  two  delegations  alone  have  been
blocking  the  “oil-for-food”  programme  by  applying
retroactive  prices  to  Iraqi  oil  in  order  to  reduce  the
earnings under the programme. The result has  been  to
hinder  the  financing  of  more  than  1,240  contracts.
Moreover,  the  so-called  green  list  has  been  expanded.
1152  contracts  worth  over  $3  billion  have  been
suspended  for  no  reason  that  we  can  find  acceptable.
The  economic  sanctions  imposed  on  Iraq  constitute  a
grave ethical failing that the United Nations must face
as 
the
Organization.  The  appalling  humanitarian  situation
being  suffered  in  Iraq  has  prompted  certain  observers
to  describe  this  policy  of  sanctions  as  a  policy  of

We would have liked the report of the Secretary-
General to take note of the American and British daily
bombardments  that  Iraq  suffers  in  the  so-called  no-
flight  zones  in  northern  and  southern  Iraq,  which  are
totally  illegal.  They  were  put  in  place  without  the
approval of the Security Council. They have led to the
death  of  a  large  number  of  Iraqi  civilians  and  to  the
destruction  of  water  purification  stations,  schools,
housing and public property. In December of last year,
the  Secretary-General  spoke  about  this  issue.  He  said

activities  conducted  by  the  United  Kingdom  and  the
United  States  against  Iraq.  I  would  like  to  note  the
statements  of  Rolf  Ekeus,  former  Chief  Inspector  in
Iraq,  who  said  that  the  Americans  took  advantage  of
UNSCOM’s  activities  to  carry  out  espionage  and  that
they  successfully  introduced  spies  into  UNSCOM  in
the  guise  of  inspectors  in  order  to  get  information  on
Iraqi security systems, its forces and the residences of
the  President  of  the  Republic.  They  also  attempted  to
install surveillance and listening devices. Such actions
are  in  violation  of  the  dignity  and  credibility  of  the
United  Nations  itself.  They  also  constitute  a  threat  to
Iraq’s national security.

A/57/PV.26
in order to divert attention from the genuine core of the
problem.  That  is  the  best  example  of  the  double-
standard policy I spoke of earlier.
Israeli  actions  against  defenceless  Palestinians
constitute  a  major  violation  of  human 
rights,
international law and the principles of the Charter. The
United  Nations  must  take  a  clear  position  on  them  in
order to protect the inalienable rights of the Palestinian
people  to  liberate  its  territory  and  to  establish  a  free
and  independent  State,  with  Al-Quds  Al-Sharif  as  its
capital. At a time when dozens of Security Council and
General  Assembly  resolutions  call  for  the  rejection  of
all geographic and demographic changes being carried
out in Jerusalem, the United States Government, which
is  accusing  Iraq  of  non-compliance  with  Security
Council resolutions, has itself signed a protocol for an
agreement  recognizing  that  Jerusalem  should  be  the
“eternal capital” of Israel.
Where,  then,  does  the  United  States  stand  in
terms  of  international  law?  What  has  become  of
Security  Council  and  General  Assembly  resolutions,
and where is respect for them? We feel the Palestinian
people  and  the  Palestinian  Authority,  and  not  the
United  States  are  the  ones  entitled  to  determine  the
capital  of  the  Palestinian  State.  We  encourage  the
United Nations, for the sake of international peace and
security, to strive to avoid any further deterioration of
the  situation  in  our  region,  given  the  critical  state  of
tension, of which we are so well aware.
Mr.  Sharma  (Nepal):  I  thank  the  President  for

reports  on  the  work  of  the  Organization  (A/57/1)  and
on  the  implementation  of  the  Millennium  Declaration
(A/57/270 and Corr.1).
My  delegation  thanks  the  Secretary-General  for

core  message  we  get  from  the  Secretary-General’s
reports, and we support it.
Nepal  is  reeling  under  the  unspeakable  anguish
and trauma of Maoist violence and abject poverty. The
Maoist  terrorists  have  terrorized  the  nation  by  killing
innocent  people  and  destroying  their  property,  as  well
as  by  blowing  up  public  infrastructure.  Their  violence
and brutality have reached new heights, causing further
hardships  for  the  people  already  desperate,  after  six
years of terror.
The situation is such that even the Government of
Prime Minister Deuba cowered under the Maoist threat
to  disrupt 
the  midterm  polls  scheduled  for  13
November 2002, and asked for the postponement of the
polls  by  more  than  a  year,  creating  a  constitutional
stalemate.  As  a  result,  His  Majesty  the  King  was
compelled  to  remove  the  inept  Deuba  Government
under  article  127  of  the  Constitution,  paving  the  way
for a new Government capable of holding the elections
at  the  earliest  possible  time.  That  was  an  interim  step
taken  to  protect  the  integrity  of  the  constitutional
monarchy  and  multiparty  democracy,  to  which  the
King has expressed full commitment.
Obviously,  we  need  external  assistance  to  fight
the  Maoist  terror  effectively,  which  entails  equipping
our  security  apparatus  to  protect  people  and  their
freedoms,  and 
reducing  poverty  and  providing
education,  health  and  basic  services  to  give  people
hope  and  opportunity.  We  thank  our  friends  who  have
supported us in this quest morally and financially, and
we urge them to continue doing so.
In  that  context,  we  note  with  appreciation  the
Secretary-General’s  offer  of  his  good  offices  to  help
resolve  that  problem,  made  in  paragraph  25  of  his
report  on  the  work  of  the  Organization.  We  will
remember  that  kind  offer  if  we  need  it.  However,  we
deplore  any  suggestion  or  that  tends  to  equate  the
Government’s  action  to  protect  its  citizens  and  the
Maoists’ indiscriminate acts of violence.
Peace  and  development  are  indivisible,  and  they
mutually  reinforce  each  other.  In  the  global  village
which  the  world  has  now  become,  conflicts  tend  to
spill  across  countries  and  continents,  and  poor  people
seek  opportunities  to  escape  dehumanizing  poverty,
often  creating  delicate  economic  and  humanitarian
situations  that  the  civilized  world  cannot  ignore.  That
makes peace and development a common cause.
The  past  12  months  have  been  a  tumultuous
period  for  the  world  community.  The  terrorist  attacks
on  the  United  States  forced  the  community  of  nations
to  wage  a  war  against  terror.  Meanwhile,  many
troubled  States  began  a  march 
to  freedom  and
normalcy, and major conferences took place to promote
economic 
and
environmental  protection.  At  the  same  time,  global
recession  continues  to  batter  the  peoples  of  many
lands.

In  the  area  of  peace  and  security,  the  war  on
terrorism  has  freed  Afghanistan  from  the  clutches  of
the  Taliban  brutality  and  obscurantism  and  from  the
shroud  of  Al  Qaeda  terror.  East  Timor  has  emerged
from the pall of violence and joined the family of free
nations. Sierra Leone and Angola have breathed a sigh
of relief after violence abated, and have begun to make
their  way  back  to  normalcy.  These  are  remarkably
encouraging developments.
However,  the  Middle  East  continues  to  hang  by
the  cusp,  ready  to  plunge  into  a  vortex  of  deeper
violence  and  wider  war.  Though  the  siege  against
Mr. Arafat  has  ended, 
the  Israeli  repression  and
restrictions  on  the  Palestinian  people  continue.  War
drums  are  beating  ever  closer  in  the  Gulf,  making  the
whole  world  nervous  about  its  possible  consequences.
We  call  on  all  sides  to  exercise  restraint  and  find
peaceful resolutions to this crisis.
Moreover,  South  Asia  remains  highly  volatile.
The  Great  Lake  Region  is  still  under  the  pall  of
uncertainty.  The  Mano  River  area  is  descending  into
deeper  crisis,  and  a  number  of  conflicts  elsewhere
continue to defy solutions.

There  is  no  problem  that  the  world  faces  today
that is as deep and dangerous as that of poverty amidst
the growing population of developing nations. Poverty
is  a  source  of  human  misery,  underdevelopment  and
despair, as well as a breeding ground for conflicts. The
present global recession has brought additional pain to
peoples around the world, hitting the poor particularly
hard.
to 
remedy 
In  order 
this  predicament, 
the
Millennium Development Goals have provided a vision
and  a  set  of  objectives  for  equitable  and  sustainable
development  on  the  planet.  The  Brussels,  Monterrey,
Johannesburg  and  Doha  conferences  have  rekindled
new  hopes  in  this  respect.  The  global  meetings  on
children  and  on  ageing  and  the  New  Partnership  for
Africa’s  Development  are  also  important  building
blocks in the pursuit of this process.
The  buzzword  now  must  be  implementation,  the
lack  of  which  has  strongly  undermined  past  global
compacts. The Secretary-General rightly warns us that
business  as  usual  is  unlikely  to  help  us  achieve  the
Millennium  Development  Goals.  Nepal  is  a  case  in
point.  A  recent  report  has  concluded  that  Nepal  is
unlikely  to  meet  eight  out  of  the  ten  Millennium
Development  Goals  within 
the  stipulated  period,
barring  the  reduction  in  child  mortality  and  attaining
the goal of providing drinking water.
Many  other  poor  countries  are  in  the  same  boat,
but  the  situation  in  least  developed  countries  is  much
worse.  It  is  therefore  necessary  that  development
partners  provide 
increased  official  development
assistance,  enhanced  market  access  and  deeper  debt
relief  to  developing  nations,  particularly  the  least
developed  ones.  Other  vulnerable  groups,  such  as
landlocked  developing  States,  should  also  receive
special  attention  from  the  international  community.
Such  steps  are  absolutely  essential  to  attain  the
Millennium Development Goals on schedule.
Indeed,  the  United  Nations’  role  in  helping  the
realization  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  and
spurring  development  in  general  is  broadly  laudable.
However,  we  fail  to  realize  that  the  economic  and
social  fields  have  suffered  from  neglect  at  the  United
Nations.

Reforms  remain  one  of  the  cardinal  priorities  of
the  United  Nations.  The  General  Assembly  and  the

changes for the better, but they remain inadequate and
their  pace  continues  to  be  sluggish.  Though  the
Security  Council’s  methods  have  somewhat  improved,
its structural reform remains distressingly stalled.
I plan to dwell on the issue of reforms at greater
length later on when the Secretary-General’s report on
the  subject  will  be  considered.  Suffice  to  say  that  the
proposed reforms are good but do not go far enough to
prepare the United Nations for the challenges posed by

meeting  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  will  cost
at  least  an  additional  $50  billion  in  annual  aid.  That
amount  of  money  should  be  made  available  by
international financial institutions, donor countries and

Development Goals, adopted in September 2000 by our
heads  of  State  and  Governments  here  in  this  Hall,  are
promises for fundamental changes. Those changes first
need  to  address  the  dimensions  of  poverty,  including
the lack of adequate food, shelter, clean drinking water,
education  and  health,  as  well  as  the  consequences  of
natural disasters.
Poverty,  peace  and  security  are  interdependent.
We  know  that.  The  issue  that  lies  at  the  heart  of  the
United  Nations  —  international  peace  and  security  —
has been thoroughly discussed and scrutinized over the
past year as a result of the horrific events of September
2001. My Government has taken the necessary steps to
implement  resolution  1373  (2001).  In  our  endeavours
to  combat  international  terrorism,  I  would  like  to
reiterate  the  importance  of  ensuring  that  the  human
rights  of  peoples  are  not  violated.  That  is  very
important.
The  fact  that  the  many  forms  of  transnational
organized  crime  —  including  drug  trafficking,  money
laundering and corruption — are increasingly taking a
global  toll,  shows  the  urgent  need  for  a  collective
approach  by  the  international  community  to  deal
effectively with these problems.
We agree with the Secretary-General that we need
to deal with conflict by preventing it rather than to face
its  tragic  consequences  once  it  has  erupted.  It  is
therefore essential to take a multidimensional approach
to  international  security,  and  not  focus  solely  on  the
military  aspect  of  security.  We  have  heard  about  the
immense  amount  of  money  devoted  to  the  area  of
defence  and  military  action.  But  we  also  have  to  look
at  political,  social,  economic  and  human  security.  The
Organization  of  American  States  devoted  its  last
general 
“A

Secretary-General  for  his  reports  on  the  work  of  the
Organization and on the implementation of the United
Nations  Millennium  Development  Goals.  We  realize
that we still have a long way to go to attain the Goals,
but I am pleased to announce that we in Suriname are
working on their implementation in the various sectors
of my country, as we have stated on several occasions
and  in  the  Main  Committees  during  the  fifty-seventh
session of the Assembly. Implementing the Millennium
Development Goals should be the ultimate prerequisite
for peace, security and sustainable human development
for  all  our  countries,  all  our  Governments  and  all  our
peoples.
The  Acting  President:  I  now  give  the  floor  to
the representative of the Democratic People’s Republic
of Korea.
Mr.  Kim  Chang  Guk  (Democratic  People’s
Republic  of  Korea):  My  delegation  expresses  its
appreciation to the Secretary-General for presenting the
reports  on  the  work  of  the  Organization  and  on  the
implementation  of  the  Millennium  Declaration.  Our
appreciation  goes  also 
to  other  Secretariat  staff
members for their contribution to the preparation of the
reports.
I  would  like  to  mention  in  brief  my  delegation’s
views  on  strengthening  the  role  of  the  United  Nations
in  ensuring 
international  peace  and  security  and
sustainable  development,  with  regard  to  the  report  of
the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization.

international 
Today, the major challenge to peace and security
is  the  emerging  doctrine  of  power  supremacy,  which
tramples  on  the  principle  of  sovereign  equality.  The
doctrine  of  power  supremacy  is  a  main  factor  in  the
undermining  of  international  relations,  and  it  poses  a

and  norms  of

confrontation  and  conflict  among  countries,  violates
the  purposes  and  the  principles  of  the  United  Nations
and  ignores  the  Organization  itself.  Ultimately,  that
constitutes  the  major  challenge  to  the  United  Nations.
Arrogant  and  impertinent  statements  labelling  other
countries as an axis of evil or as targets of pre-emptive
nuclear attack, made at will and in one’s own interests,
are also rooted in the doctrine of power supremacy.

law.  The 
The  challenges  that  we  now  face  require  us  to
demonstrate  concerted  will  and  action,  in  respect  for
sovereignty,  equality  and  the  development  of  fair
international  relations.  It  is  now  urgent  that  we
decisively  enhance  the  leading  role  of  the  United
Nations  in  our  joint  efforts  to  develop  just  and  fair
relations  among  nations,  based  on  sovereign  equality,
in  order  to  guarantee  world  peace  and  security  and
sustainable development.
All  Member  States  should  respect  the  Charter  of
the  United  Nations  and  faithfully  carry  out 
the
purposes  and  principles  enshrined  therein.  What  is
important  here  is  our  adherence  to  the  principles  of
justice and impartiality. Without the principles and the
impartiality of international law, the just settlement of
problems can never be assured. Only when the Charter
is  respected  and  implemented  in  good  faith  can  all
problems be settled properly.
My  delegation  asserts  that  the  functions  of  the
General Assembly should be strengthened and that the
Security  Council  should  be  thoroughly  reformed  to
meet  the  demands  of  Member  States.  In  addition,  the
Economic and Social Council should be empowered to
enhance its role and functions in order to reform unfair
international  economic  systems  and  to  contribute  to

Millennium Declaration has been both a success and a

what  the  Secretary-General  said  in  his  report,  namely

legitimate 
In  any  event,  it  is  not  acceptable  to  confuse
terrorism  with 
foreign
occupation. The Secretary-General points out that there
has  been  an  increase  in  the  number  of  hotbeds  of
tension throughout the world. The world does seem to
be  backsliding,  and  the  number  of  conflicts  has
increased.  This  is  a  reality  that  we  cannot  deny.  Nor
can we deny the achievements recorded by the United
Nations  in  safeguarding  peace  and  in  settling  disputes
and conflicts over the same period.
However, the importance attached by the Security
Council  to  certain  issues  and  the  selectivity  that  has
been  noted  in  the  application  of  Security  Council
resolutions  has  given  rise  to  certain  questions.  In
particular,  the  Council  has  not  rigorously  applied
resolutions  relating  to  the  Middle  East.  This  is  quite
obvious.  It  has  had  an  effect  on  the  credibility  of  the
Organization and has limited its effectiveness.
It is only logical that peace and security cannot be
achieved  in  a  world  of  inequality,  repression  and
injustice. In this world, the great majority — 4 billion
people  —  are  deprived  of  the  most  basic  necessities
and  are  far  removed  from  the  material  prosperity
enjoyed by the minority.
Despite the efforts that have been made to narrow
the  gap  between  developed  and  developing  countries,
very  little  has  been  achieved.  We  believe  that  the
absence  of  political  will  on  the  part  of  the  developed
countries in assuming their responsibilities remains the
primary cause of the deterioration of the situation. The
resolutions  adopted  at 
the  Doha,  Monterrey  and
Johannesburg  conferences  are  to  a  large  extent  linked
to the positions and decisions taken by those States.
Mr.  Kpotsra (Togo),  Vice-President,  took  the
Chair.
The Secretary-General’s report underlines the fact
that very limited progress has been made in the area of
human  rights  over  the  last  two  years.  The  holding  of
the  World  Conference  against  Racism,  Racial
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in

achievements of that period.

perspective of this Organization.
the  global  situation  from 
the
International  attention  should  focus  on  the  fight
against  terrorism,  and  in  that  respect  the  Secretary-
General  stresses  that  attempts  to  prevent  terrorism
should  not  be  used  as  a  pretext  to  violate  the  basic
rights of individuals and of communities. At the same
time, stopping terrorism involves the consolidation and
protection  of  human  rights  and  democracy,  as  well  as
social justice.
For  our  part,  we  would  also  like  to  affirm  and
endorse what has been said by many other delegations.
We should avoid any policitization of human rights and
any  policy  involving  a  double  standard,  because  not
only  does  this  not  contribute  to  the  realization  of
human  rights  or  of  democracy,  but  it  also  damages
international relations and impedes the achievement of
the goals of this Organization.
In today’s globalized and interdependent world, a
world  of  common  concerns,  there  is  a  great  need  to
strengthen  the  role  of  the  United  Nations  and  its
effectiveness as the best means and the best framework
for multilateral diplomacy, which is no longer a choice
but a necessity in the face of today’s challenges.
We  note  with  satisfaction  the  changes  that  have
recently  occurred  in  the  United  Nations  in  various
areas  and  that  are  aimed  at  adjusting  it  to  the  rapid
changes  that  are  taking  place  on  the  international
scene,  so  as  to  give  the  Organization  the  capacity  to
adapt  and  to  consolidate  its  role  in  today’s  world.
However,  the  winds  of  change  have  not  affected  the
Security Council, despite the pressure of events and the
logic  of  the  situation,  which  makes  it  necessary  to
enlarge  the  Council’s  membership,  including  in  the
permanent category.
The  delegation  of  Yemen  has  already  expressed
its  support  for  the  reforms  and  structural  changes
proposed  by  the  Secretary-General,  and  we  look
forward to the opinions and observations he will make
and conclusions he will reach in the report that he has
promised to submit soon.
Mr.  Balstra  (San  Marino):  Let  me  congratulate
the President on the decision to discuss jointly the two
excellent reports of the Secretary-General on the work
of  the  Organization  and  on  the  follow-up  to  the
outcome  of  the  Millennium  Summit.  Indeed,  both
reports are complementary, and together they give us a

demonstrate  that  the  only  way  to  deal  with  the  most
important  problems  affecting  humankind  is  through
concrete  multilateral 
initiatives  and  actions.  The
collective  fight  against  terrorism  being  undertaken  at
present  by  the  entire  international  community  is  clear
evidence  that  multilateralism  is  the  only  effective
means  of  coping  with  the  problems  confronting  the
world.
I  shall  refrain  from  commenting  in  detail  on  the
issues  raised  by  the  Secretary-General,  because  San
Marino agrees with most of his conclusions. However,
an  issue  of  particular  interest  to  my  delegation  in  the
context of the strengthening of the Organization is the
revitalization  of  the  General  Assembly.  The  way  in
which  the  General  Assembly  is  structured  does  not
meet  the  efficiency  requirements  that  we  all  expect
from the principal and most representative organ of the
United Nations.
It  is  true  that  some  adjustments  have  been  made
in  these  procedures,  but  they  are  not  sufficient.  It  is
necessary to continue with this task, especially in two
major  areas:  the  rationalization  of  its  agenda  and  the
way to ensure the follow-up and implementation of its
resolutions.
The Millennium Declaration has set the goals we
have to achieve. The Conferences of Doha, Monterrey
and  Johannesburg  strengthened 
these  goals  and
established a roadmap for global progress. We have to
act accordingly to ensure that all countries comply with
their  commitments 
to  guarantee  a  fair
distribution of the benefits of globalization.

The  response  of  the  United  Nations  to  threats
posed  by  terrorism  to  the  security  and  stability  of  the
global community, in the aftermath of 11 September, is
well  documented  in  the  two  reports  submitted  by  the
Secretary-General.
We wish to take this opportunity to commend the
Secretary-General  and  his  staff  for  their  clear  and
concise  reporting  on  the  progress  achieved  over  the
past year. We, as Member States of the United Nations,
A/57/PV.26
have a responsibility to one another to deal with threats
to peace and security, while simultaneously addressing
other pressing priorities.
As  the  Secretary-General  himself  stated  in  his
opening remarks, it is imperative that we all do more to
ensure  that  the  pledges  in  the  Millennium  Declaration
are fulfilled.
(spoke in English)
Poverty  eradication,  conflict  prevention, 
the
protection  of  civilians  in  armed  conflict,  sustainable
development,  HIV/AIDS  and  migration  lost  none  of
their  urgency  and,  indeed,  their  relevancy  to  our  own
security.
We  would  like  to  draw  attention  to  three  areas
highlighted  in  the  Millennium  Declaration,  where
progress  has  indeed  been  achieved  since  2000,  but
where  much  remains  to  be  done.  These  areas  include,
first,  the  establishment  of  the  International  Criminal
Court;  second,  the  responsibility  of  States  to  prevent
conflict,  to  protect  the  innocent  and  to  rebuild  when
conflict is over; and, third, to deal effectively with the
special needs of Africa.
At  the  Millennium  Summit  in  September  2000,
heads of State and Government resolved
“To ensure the implementation, by States Parties,
of  treaties  in  areas  such  as  arms  control  and
disarmament,  and  of  international  humanitarian
law  and  human  rights  law,  and  [to]  call  upon  all
States to consider signing and ratifying the Rome
Statute of the International Criminal Court”.
The  entry  into  force  of  the  Rome  Statute  on  1

issue  shortly.  To  this  end,  we  will  be  enlisting

subject.  We  believe  that  we  will  find  that  we  share
considerable  common  ground  as  we  respond  to  the

very  much  look  forward  to  working  with  Members  of

As 
the  Secretary-General  underlined 
in  his
remarks  to  us  at  the  beginning  of  this  debate,  our
progress  on  reaching  the  Millennium  Development
Goals remains uneven. At the heart of the Millennium
Declaration was the need to meet the special needs of
Africa  and  to  redress  the  poverty  that  is  the  decisive
reality for so many people. We noted with concern the
Secretary-General’s  analysis  that  10  years  ago,  48  per
cent of the people of Africa were living on one dollar a
day  or  less.  Today,  that  figure  has  shrunk  almost
imperceptibly  to  47  per  cent.  To  meet  our  goal  of
reducing  that  figure  by  half  by  2015,  we  will  have  to
do much better.
It  is  for  this  reason  that  Canada,  as  this  year’s
Chair of the G-8, has made implementation of the G-8
Africa Action Plan a priority. This Action Plan includes
over  100  commitments,  many  of  which  are  addressed
to  areas  crucial  to  development,  such  as  resource
mobilization, 
governance,
education,  health,  economic  growth,  agriculture  and
water. We welcome the affirmation by France, the next
Chair  of  the  G8,  that  Africa  will  remain  a  priority  on
the G8 agenda.

Finally, the implementation of the United Nations

While  the  challenges  are  considerable,  we  must  heed

Mr.  Gallegos  Chiriboga  (Ecuador)  (spoke  in

The  delegation  of  Ecuador  considers  that  it  is
indispensable  to  support  the  efforts  to  reform  the
General  Assembly.  After  many  years  and  its  many
important  tasks,  the  Assembly  of  the  peoples  of  the
world  has  ceased  to  be  the  scene  of  the  great  debates
and the forum where all can apply their wills to solve
the challenges presented by history. I wish to pledge to
you,  Sir,  and  the  delegates,  Ecuador’s  willingness  to
collaborate in the reform that will enable us to fulfil the
18
visions  of  the  men  and  women  of  this  world  and  to
change existing conditions that torment the world.
Mr.  Aisi  (Papua  New  Guinea):  From  the  outset,
allow me to express my delegation’s congratulations to
the  President  on  his  election  to  preside  over  the  fifty-
the  United  Nations  General
seventh  session  of 
Assembly.  We  are  confident 
that  with  his  able
leadership,  the  General  Assembly  will  successfully
deliberate  on  all  the  important  issues  on  our  work
programme.
Also,  through  the  President,  we  would  like  to
convey  our  gratitude  to  the  Secretary-General  and  his
hard  working  staff  in  the  discharge  of  their  functions
on  behalf  of  all  of  us,  the  Member  countries  of  the
Organization.  Much  of  that  work  is  reflected  in  the
report  of  the  Secretary-General  on  the  work  of  the
Organization (A/57/1).
report 
The  Secretary-General’s 
features  an
overview of the remarkable efforts made by the United
Nations  to  tackle  the  many  problems  facing  the
international  community.  Examples  of  such  issues
include the struggle to achieve international peace and
security,  combating  international  terrorism,  poverty
eradication, the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic,
as well as sustainable development, to name a few.
In the field of international peace and security, we
note the tremendous efforts that the United Nations has
made 
in  countries  such  as  Afghanistan,  Angola,
Burundi, Kosovo, Sierra Leone and Congo. My country
has  also  had  its  share  of  the  world’s  problems,
especially in the province of Bougainville.
In that case, the United Nations has supported the
Government and people of Papua New Guinea in every
step  we  took  in  the  peacemaking  process.  The  United
Nations  continues  its  support  with  respect  to  lasting
peace on Bougainville, which has been heartening. We
are  deeply  grateful  to  the  United  Nations  and,  indeed,
to  the  Security  Council  and  its  members,  for  their
contribution in the past, which we  sincerely  hope  will
continue in the future. The establishment of the United
Nations  Political  Office 
its
continued role in the peace-building process, including
the  current  disarmament  programme,  is  a  highly
commendable process.
in  Bougainville  and 
The  dividends  of  peace  that  we  see  in  trouble
spots,  such  as  in  my  country,  is  a  testament  to  the
loyalty  and  commitments  of  United  Nations  personnel
deployed on peacekeeping duties. We are cognizant of
the  important  role  they  play  in  the  maintenance  of
international  peace  and  security  and  therefore  urge  all
of us to support this noble cause.
The  United  Nations  has  championed  global
efforts  to  address  the  aforementioned  and  other  issues
affecting its Member countries. This is reflected in the
important international conferences and in the adoption
of  appropriate  legal  instruments  to  deal  with  those
issues.  That  includes  the  adoption  of  the  Rio  outcome
on  biological  diversity,  climate  change  and 
the
statement  on 
the  Forest  Principles;  regional  and
international treaties to ban nuclear tests; the Barbados
Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development
of Small Island Developing States and  conferences  on
the rights of women and children, to name a few.
While  noting  the  remarkable  efforts  by  the
international  community  under  the  auspices  of  the
United Nations, it is fair to say that the lack of progress
in certain areas of implementation can be attributed in
part  to  the  inadequate  commitment  of  financial  and
other  much 
successful
implementation.

for 
As  the  Organization  charged  with  servicing  the
needs of Member countries, we are pleased to note the
efforts of the United Nations to streamline our common
endeavour  to  meaningfully  address  the  issues  facing
humanity. This is evident through the Doha Ministerial
Declaration  on  trade,  the  Monterrey  Consensus  on
the  Millennium

The  Millennium  Goals  are  also  the  national

look  forward  to  securing  international  assistance  to
complement the national efforts to achieve our national
development objectives.
Being a small island country, Papua New Guinea
faces  the  extreme  development  challenges  also  faced
by  other  small  island  developing  States.  The  lack  of
adequate  resources  and  the  resulting  constraints  place

Pacific island States.
In 
the 
light  of 
that,  we  view 
regional
collaboration  through  regional  organizations,  such  as
the  South  Pacific  Regional  Environment  Programme
and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, as critical for
us  to  forge  collective  efforts  to  address  issues  of
common  concern.  The  technical  experts  in  our  region
play  an  important  role  in  assisting  Pacific  island
countries in meeting their development challenges and
in  fulfilling  our  commitments  and  obligations,  as
stipulated  in  the  Millennium  Declaration,  the  World
Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  and  other
relevant instruments.
In  that  context,  it  is  important  for  regional
organizations,  such  as 
the  Pacific  Island  Forum
Secretariat,  to  establish  good  working  relations  with
the United Nations Secretariat. In that way, we believe
the United Nations Secretariat and, indeed, other world
organizations  and  bodies,  would  better  appreciate  the
problems and development challenges we face.
Finally,  we  commend  the  Secretary-General  for
his commitment and pledge our continuing support.
I  wish 
(Malawi): 
Mr.  Lamba
to  express
solidarity  with  earlier  speakers  who  have  spoken  so
eloquently  on  the  matter  under  discussion  today  —
particularly  considering  the  great  importance  of  the
Millennium  Summit  and  the  centrality  of  the  issues  it
raises  on  the  development  of  the  poor  regions  of  this
world,  including  Africa.  Let  me  also  thank  Secretary-
General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his comprehensive report
(A/57/270)  on  the  progress  so  far  registered  in  the
implementation  of  the  Millennium  Declaration  and
further  actions  to  be  taken  to  accelerate  the  pursuit  of
the Millennium Development Goals.
In  his  report,  the  Secretary-General  has  pointed
out  that  the  Millennium  Declaration  represents  the
vision of the great family of nations in their pursuit of
justice, peace and prosperity for all humanity.

out  that  the  Millennium  Declaration  represents  the

indicated  by  the  Secretary-General,  we  are  sadly
nowhere  near  attaining  even  one 
the
Millennium  Development  Goals,  two  years  after  they
were  adopted.  The  pace  of  implementation  is  clearly
tenth  of 
19
A/57/PV.26
too slow, and drastic  actions and stronger efforts need
to be made to fast-track implementation.
On  the  issue  of  peace,  security  and  disarmament
in  the  world,  a  mixed  picture  has  emerged,  albeit
negative  in  certain  regions,  including  the  African
continent.  Encouraging  results  have,  however,  been
seen  in  the  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo  and
Angola  —  just  to  mention  two  —  where  peace
initiatives are on course and the fruits of those positive
trends  are  already  evident.  We  congratulate  all  the
parties involved in those peace processes. It is our hope
and  our  wish  that  peace  and  stability  will  quickly
return  to  Côte  d’Ivoire,  where  the  situation  is  still
turbulent.
I join other speakers in lamenting the horrible 11
September terrorist attack on the United States and the
attendant  loss  of  precious  lives.  Malawi  seeks  to
reiterate  its  unequivocal  condemnation  of  terrorism,
whatever  form  it  takes  and  no  matter  what  cause  may
be advanced to justify its perpetration across the globe.
No reason can justify terrorism.
There  is  need  to  control  and  dispose  of  surplus
illicit  small  arms  and  light  weapons.  Malawi  is
currently the unfortunate victim of that menace, largely
due to the influx of illegal small arms that have ended
up  in  the  hands  of  common  criminals.  That  is  a
problem shared by many countries today.
The HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to destroy the
limited success so far registered on the socio-economic
front in our countries. It is destroying the very core of
our  productive  capacity,  comprising  young  men  and
women.  We  need  the  support  of  our  development
partners  in  that  fight,  particularly  on  the  African
continent. It must be recognized that HIV/AIDS is not
only a health or development issue; it is also a security
issue for all countries, as manifested by its debate, for
the first time, in the Security Council in January 2000.
The  issue  of  poverty  reduction  is  close  to  the
heart of most domestic programmes of development in
our  economies,  such  as  Malawi’s  ,  where  it  forms  the
rallying call of the Government. The goal of cutting by
half the number of people that survives on less than a
dollar a day by 2015 is therefore extremely crucial for
the  United  Nations  family,  particularly  for  us  in  the
developing world.
My  delegation  appeals  to  the  developed  nations
and  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  to  create  a  more

free trade for our products to be able to penetrate  and

We would like to ask the developed countries not
only to give us soft loans, but also to go all the way in
completely  writing  off  the  outstanding  debts.  We  ask
them  to  concentrate  on  grants  and  foreign  direct
investment,  and  also  to  increase  official  development
assistance to the recommended level of 0.7 per cent of
their  gross  national  product.  Let  me

to  new  and  emerging  challenges  so  as  to  fulfil  its
mandates,  chief  of  which  are  peace,  security  and
sustainable development.
It  is  the  stated  objective  of  my  country  to
contribute  to  peace  and  security  in  the  world.  That
commitment  is  derived  from  our  own  experience  in
suffering  the  consequences  of  war.  The  people  of  the
Republic  of  Angola  are  all  too  aware  that  sustainable
development,  political  stability,  good  governance,  the
rule of law and the enhancement of respect for human
rights  can  only  be  achieved  through  the  prevalence  of
peace  and  security.  To  achieve  peace  and  security,  we
cherish and defend the values  at the foundation of the
Charter.  As  it  relates  to  the  prevention  and  resolution
of  conflicts,  we  urge  Member  States,  as  has  the
Secretary-General,  “to continue to  increase  our  efforts
to  achieve  international  order  and  justice  through
negotiation and consensus” (A/57/1).

Notable  advances  were  also  made  by 
the
international community in the fight against terrorism.
To  that  end,  the  Organization  proved  its  adaptability
and  capability 
to  deal  with  new  and  emerging
challenges. The Republic of Angola reiterates its strong
condemnation  of  terrorist  acts  wherever  they  may
occur,  and  continues  to  be  committed  to  the  strict
implementation  of  Security  Council  resolution  1373
(2001).  We  are  hopeful  that  the  Open-ended  Working
Group  of 
the  Sixth  Committee  on  drafting  a
comprehensive  convention  on  international  terrorism
can conclude its work during the present session.
We  regret  the  lack  of  progress  in  the  area  of
disarmament, particularly as it relates to the prevention
of an arms race in outer space and the establishment of
covenants  that  will  dissuade  Member  States  from
developing and acquiring weapons of mass destruction.
We  therefore  urge  the  parties  involved  to  consider  the
immense  potential  benefits  to  the  many  achievable
through small risks taken by the few.
Commendable  progress  is  also  reported  in  the
areas  of  electoral  assistance,  eradicating  extreme
poverty, attaining the Millennium Development Goals,
the  promotion  of  human  rights  and  the  fight  against
transnational organized crime, including the trafficking
in  persons,  firearms  and  drugs.  That  would  not  have

We  must  also  commend  the  report  on  efforts  at

Organization.  We  are  also  pleased  and  enthusiastic
about the introduction of modern resource management
techniques.  In  the  face  of  budgetary  constrains,  we
encourage  the  introduction  of  an  “electronic”  United
Nations.  But  we  also  caution  that  these  efforts  should
not  impact  negatively  upon  the  participation  of  all
Member States, particularly that of the least developed
countries.
The  Millennium  Development  Goals  represent  a
road  map  to  sustainable  development  in  the  age  of
globalization.  Their  achievement  will 
transform

May  I  take  it  that  the  General  Assembly  takes
