The  President:  The  Assembly  will  now  hear  an
address by the President of the Republic of Slovenia.
Mr.  Milan  Ku훾an,  President  of  the  Republic  of

The  President:  On  behalf  of 
the  General
Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United
Nations His Excellency Mr. Milan Ku훾an, President of
the  Republic  of  Slovenia,  and to invite  him  to  address
the Assembly.
President  Ku훾an (spoke  in  Slovenian;  English
text  provided  by  the  delegation):  It  was  10  years  ago,
immediately  following 
the  admission  of  newborn
Slovenia  to  the  United  Nations,  that  I  addressed  the
Assembly  for  the  first  time.  I  did  so  with  great  pride,
with faith in the United Nations and  with gratitude for
the  chance  given  to  my  country  to  present  to  the
international  community  its  own  views  on  current
world  affairs,  with  a  sense  of  responsibility  for  its
actions  not  only  towards  its  own  citizens,  but  also
towards the entire international democratic community.
Looking  back  at  the  past  decade,  I  can  say
without  the  slightest  reservation  that,  without  the
United Nations, life on our planet would be even more
uncertain,  social 
injustice  would  be  even  more
widespread  and  global  disparities  in  prosperity  even
more  marked.  There  would  be  even  more  systematic
violations  of  human  rights  in  many  States  and  even
more wars.
that, 
throughout 
In  spite  of  its  acknowledged  weaknesses  and
inefficiencies,  this  world  Organization  has  done  great
work.  I  daresay 
its  membership,
Slovenia,  too,  has  contributed  to  this  through  its  own
active pursuit of the principles of the United Nations. It
received  widespread  recognition  for 
it
accomplished  as  a  non-permanent  member  of  the
Security  Council;  this  is  something  of  which  we  are
particularly proud.

The  violence  committed  by  States  against  their  own
peoples is now faced with a new force: the ethic of the
democratic  world.  This  ethic  does  not  recognize
absolute State sovereignty or absolute non-interference
in  internal  affairs  when  systematic  mass  violations  of
human rights, through State terror, occur.
The  principle  of  humanitarian  intervention  is  the
beginning  of  an  important  process  of  implementing
global  ethics  in  the  governance  of  this  globalized  and
increasingly  interdependent  world.  It  is  also  a  clear
message  to  the  authors  of  international  law  and  to
international judicial institutions. It is one of the pillars
of  the  next  phase  of  international  law,  as  is  the
International  Criminal  Court.  No  one  any  longer  has
responsibility 
State
sovereignty  is  no  longer  untouchable.  Everyone,  in
their  actions,  also  has  a  responsibility  towards  global

Certain  measures  of  the  global  community  of
States in response to the challenges of  the twenty-first
century,  such  as  the  special  session  on  the  future  of
children,  the  World  Summit  Sustainable  Development
and  the  forthcoming  meetings  on  a  better  future  for
Africa  are  signs  that  the  United  Nations  is  gaining  in
political and moral clout as an Organization common to
all States and as an organization capable of finding the
strength to carry out the announced internal reforms.

But  as  time  passed,  it  became  increasingly  clear
that  even  the  best  military  weaponry  of  the  anti-
terrorist  coalition  could  not  reach  down  to  the  social
roots of this horrendous evil. This evil is craftily taking
advantage  of  the  apathy  and  the  anger  of  people  and
States without a future. This evil is trying to regain its
2
strength  by  playing  on 
religious,  cultural  and
civilizational  differences,  intertwined  with  the  great
social rifts in our global world. Evil, understood in this
way (cid:151) an evil that threatens to use the most atrocious
weapons of mass destruction (cid:151) can be eradicated only
through  concerted  action  by  democratic  States  under
the umbrella of the United Nations.
It  is  precisely  in  this  context  that  the  authority
and  credibility  of  the  United  Nations  are  on  trial.  The
Organization  has  proven  itself  capable  of  reaching
common  positions  and  decisions  even  on  the  most
demanding issues. We are capable of defining common
positions, even concerning the actions of those who do
not  respect 
these  common  decisions.  The  United
Nations now must have the ability not only to speak of
those  positions,  but  also  to  implement  them  through
concerted action. That is the responsibility that all of us
face today.
Globalization, with all of its positive and negative
aspects,  is  a  given  fact.  Let  us  do  more  to  transform
that  fact  into  something  that  is  in  keeping  with  the
needs  of  the  people  and  the  rule  of  individual  and
collective  human  rights.  Certainly,  this  cannot  be
achieved  by  trying  to  drive  peoples,  States,  cultures,
religions  and  civilizations  away  from 
their  own
identities,  by  trying  to  place  them  under  the  common
denominator  of  a  single  global  identity.  That  would
signify  the  collapse  of  our  human  world,  bearing
disastrous consequences. Today(cid:146)s world, where borders
between 
between
civilizations (cid:151) are growing less rigid, is a world full of
plural 
identities  and  of  clearly  defined  national,
cultural  and  religious  entities  that  are  beginning  to
open up to one another.
States  (cid:151) 
particularly 
and 
This plurality calls for a unique integrating factor.
That  factor  can  only  be  a  global  ethic  based  on  the
ancient  principle  of  reciprocity  among  human  beings:
do  unto others  as  you  would have  others  do  unto  you.
In times of interdependence among each and every one
of  us,  such  values  are  particularly  important.  The
global  ethic  should  be  developed  based  on  this  value,
for it is a value  with deep roots in the world(cid:146)s age-old
great  religions  and  civilizations.  Based  on  this  value,
we  will  be  able  to  strengthen  universal  human  rights
and  global  social  justice,  and  without  that  justice,  one
cannot expect the world to be a safe and peaceful place
offering people justified hope that our planet belongs to
all of humanity.
International  terrorism  has  unveiled  the  negative
aspects  of  interdependence  among  our  societies.  We
must  now  do  more  to  strengthen  the  positive  aspects
and  to  create  new  ones.  The  environmental,  economic
and ethical challenges humanity is facing today require
a  radical  rethinking  of  global  governance  and  the
establishment of global responsibility. This  is  so  much
more  so  since  we  are  faced  with  the  breakdown  of
trade,  with  an
regulation  and  control 
inequitable 
that
generates misery and humiliation, and that  manifests a
relentless  preference  for  economic  and  financial  logic
over ecological, social and human demands. A positive
alternative  must  be  found  to  these  negative  aspects  of
our interdependence.
global  development  machinery 
in  global 
Present  generations  of  statesmen,  politicians,
academicians and civil society all have a duty to lay the
foundations of a global ethic and a United Nations that
offers stronger guarantees for a world that is no longer
so  fiercely  divided  into  peoples,  nations  and  States
with the right to a  future  and those  who  are robbed of
that future by the technological  and  social  gaps of  our
planet.
I am convinced that  there  will be  a  kinder  future
for our world and a more creative future for the United
Nations.  It  is  with  this  in  mind  that  I  most  warmly
welcome our new Member, Switzerland, and soon also,
Timor-Leste.  These  two  new  Members  illustrate  very
clearly  all  the  disparities  in  our  globalized  world.  I
firmly  believe  that  their  work  in  this  Assembly  will
help  transform  the  United  Nations  into  a  community
for the entire world.
The  President:  On  behalf  of 
the  General
Assembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic
of Slovenia for the statement he has just made.

The  President:  On  behalf  of 
the  General
Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United
Nations  His  Excellency  Mr.  John  Agyekum  Kufuor,
President  of  the  Republic  of  Ghana,  and  to  invite  him
to address the Assembly.
President  Kufuor:  A  year  ago  the  entire  world
watched in horror as terror was visited on the city that
plays  host  to  the  United  Nations.  It  is  a  city  that  has
welcomed  people  from  all  corners  of  the  world  for
hundreds  of  years  and  that  still  remains  for  many  an
irresistible magnet as a place of opportunity.
We watched (cid:151) all of us, from our different parts
of the world (cid:151) as the terrible events unfolded. If there
had  been  any  doubt  before,  that  experience  convinced
all  of  us  that  our  world  had  indeed  become  a  global
village.  Modern 
technology  enabled  all  of  us
simultaneously  to  watch  the  events  as  they  unfolded.
The  devastation  and  drama  of  those  events  have  since
forcefully brought grief to our individual hearts, across
continents,  races,  religions  and  political  ideologies.  If
ever  there  was  any  doubt  about  mankind(cid:146)s  shared
humanity, that catastrophe conclusively dispelled it.
A  year  on,  we  still  bear  the  deep  scars;  we  have
not  forgotten,  and  we  dare  not  forget,  because  what
happened  was  not  directed  exclusively  against  New
York and the people of the United States. Nationals of
many  countries,  including  Ghanaians,  perished  in  that
tragedy.  What  happened  was  indeed  an  affront  to
civilization itself.
Throughout  the  ages,  whenever  humanity  has
found itself confronted with great danger, it is the sense
of  unity  and  common  purpose  that  has  pulled  us
through. This is no exception. Indeed, the resilience of
New  York  and  of  the  people  of  the  United  States  has
brought  about a spirit of  solidarity and  generosity that
is just as awesome to behold as the tragic event itself.
organizations, 
It is for that reason that I am optimistic about the
future.  The  work  of  the  United  Nations  and  of  non-
governmental 
growing
acceptance  of  the  principles  of  good  governance,
human rights, tolerance for a diversity of views and the
rule of law around the globe make me optimistic. In my
mind(cid:146)s  eye,  I  can  already  see,  in  the  near  future,  a
world 
is  more  openness,  more
forbearance and less categorization of mankind.

adversity, 
of
interdependence  among  peoples  has  become  a  reality.
Now  we  are  moving  from  the  concept  of  (cid:147)beggar  thy
neighbour(cid:148)  to  one  of  (cid:147)prosper  thy  neighbour(cid:148),  which
should become the hallmark of the global village.
Sadly, the continent of  Africa still lags behind in
many  spheres,  as  poverty  and  disease  plague  the
continent.  But  there  is  a  new  spirit  abroad  among  the
African  countries.  Africa  has  never  wanted  to  be
perceived as the (cid:147)scar on the conscience of the world(cid:148).
We do not want to be the object of pity and charity, and
we  do  not  want  to  provide  the  grisly  images  of  war,
disease, ignorance, famine and poverty for the  world(cid:146)s
television  screens.  It  was  largely  as  a  result  of  our
determination  to  shed  that  unacceptable  image  that
many  a  country  on 
the  continent,  on  attaining
independence,  desperately  rushed  into  one  or  another
untried ideology or economic model that tended only to
worsen  the  woes of  self-doubt  left  by  exploitative  and
unconscionable colonialism.
Today,  under  the  auspices  of  the  African  Union,
the  rejuvenated  continental  grouping,  our  countries
have  resolved  to  tackle  the  continent(cid:146)s  problems  to
enable  us  join  the  mainstream  of  world  development.
We  have pledged to endeavour  to  be  honest  with  each
other, and under the Peer Review Mechanism there will
be  no  hiding  behind  claims  of  sovereignty  in  order  to
tolerate abuses of human rights in individual countries.
We  are  determined  to  strive  for  democracy  and
good  governance,  not  because  those  are  fashionable
buzzwords but because  we are convinced that they  are
the surest (cid:151) if not always the most rapid (cid:151) path to the
development that we require to uplift the conditions of
life of our peoples.
The  technology  exists  and  the  human  expertise
abounds in the world to end the degrading poverty and
debilitating  diseases  that  sap  the  confidence  of  the
peoples  of  Africa.  This  world  Assembly  must  rally  to
help  Africa  in  its  genuine  efforts  to  tap  into  the
intellectual, financial and moral resources of the globe,
to  be  a  worthy  partner  within  it.  The  concept  of  the
New  Partnership  for  Africa(cid:146)s  Development  (NEPAD)
provides the framework within which African countries
can  be  assisted  to  become  part  of  the  mainstream.  It
provides a great opportunity for world leaders to move
from rhetoric to purposeful action.
Education has served as a route out of poverty for
people  throughout  the  ages,  and  it  should  be  the  way

is  a  well-endowed  continent.  Our  raw
materials keep the  manufacturing engines of the  world
running. The reasons for investing in Africa, therefore,
need  not  be  charitable;  investment  can  be  based  on
sound  economic  considerations.  The  market  potential
of  a  thriving  and  economically  viable  Africa  will  do
wonders  not  only  for  Africa  but  also  for  the  world
economy at large.
I  am  optimistic,  because  I  think  of  what  Ghana
and  the  African  continent  have  contributed  to  the
development  of  the  world.  We  have  provided,  and
continue  to  provide,  personnel  in  various  fields  to  all
kinds of institutions in the world. Ghanaian academics
and citizens from many other African countries can be
found  in  many  top  universities  and  companies  around
the  world,

But  Ghana, 
like  other  developing  countries,
cannot alone achieve the dramatic rate of growth that is
required; there must be significant injections of outside

sustainable  sources  of  energy  to  be  able  to  achieve

and  support  of  the  international  community  to  sustain

Ghana acknowledges its share of responsibility to
protect the resources that Nature has given our country
as the heritage of all humankind. The world cannot and
must  not  operate  on  the  basis  of  the  survival  of  the
fittest. Weaknesses caused by history and other factors
must be taken into account and, above all, our common
humanity must inform all our international dealings.
Ghana sees a lot of potential in globalization. We
wish to recommend, however, that an organization such
as  the  United  Nations  should  provide  the  regulatory
framework  to  ensure  that  the  benefits  of  globalization
are  more  equitably  distributed.  The  opportunities  are
enormous  for  those  who  can  take  advantage  of  the
move  to  more  liberalized  markets  and  increased  flows
of  investment  capital.  But  nature  did  not  make  all
people  equally  competitive.  That  global  organization
must,  therefore,  evolve  systems  of  safety  nets  to
guarantee all humanity an acceptable  minimum  degree
of dignity and respectability. The United Nations must
rise up to this challenge.
For  the  pure  and  proper  development  of  the
global  village,  certain  initiatives  by  this  Organization
must  be  commended  and  encouraged.  Ghana  is  in  full
support of United Nations effort to curb the illicit trade
in  small  arms  and  light  weapons.  We  urge  Member
States  to  join  in  the  early  implementation  of  the
Programme of Action that was adopted in 2001 to stop
this trade, from which most of the instability in Africa
stems.
and 
Secondly,  women 
children  need  our
protection.  It  is  for  that  very  reason  that  in  Ghana  we
have  created  a  Ministry  for  Women  and  Children(cid:145)s
Affairs to enable  us tackle  issues that  affect those two
groups.  We  have  embarked  on  a  vibrant  educational
campaign  and  are  pursuing  policy  initiatives  that  will
create  awareness  and 
incidence  of
discrimination  against  women  and  help  improve  their
livelihoods.  We  are  also  striving  to  ban  child  labour
reduce 
the 
A/57/PV.4
and  enforce  free  and  compulsory  education  for  all
children  up  to  the  junior  secondary  school  level  as
enjoined by Ghana(cid:145)s national Constitution.
Thirdly, I must mention the HIV/AIDS pandemic,
which is threatening the survival of our countries. The
spread  of  the  disease  is  compounding  our  difficulties
even  further.  I  wish  to  pay  tribute  to  the  Secretary-
General  for  his  interest,  and  for  the  setting  up  of  the
Global  Fund  to  help  us  fight  the  menace.  The  Ghana
AIDS  Commission  is  constantly  seeking  new  ways  to
change  attitudes  at  all  levels  towards  the  disease,  and
we  seek  to  learn  from  the  experience  of  others  in
combating it. We support the efforts of the international
community  to  provide  more  affordable  antiretroviral
drugs for the most needy.
At 
this 
stage,  permit  me 
to  congratulate
Switzerland  on  its  accession  to  membership,  and  East
Timor  on  its  forthcoming  accession.  That  Switzerland
has  at  long  last  joined  the  Organization  confirms  its
universality. They are welcome.
The tragedy of 11 September has certainly made a
difference  to  the  world.  It  has  shocked  the  world  into
uniting  to  condemn  it.  Let  those  of  us  who  have
accepted the honour and privilege to speak on behalf of
our  peoples  determine  that  we  must  strive  for  a  world
of  greater  tolerance  and  of  more  justice,  a  more
humane  world  in  which  law  and  order  are  fully
respected  both  within  nations  and  in  the  international
community.  Eleven  September  must  be  used 
to
underpin  the  vital  communal  spirit  that  must  motivate
the  global  village.  We  would  then  be  able  to  say  that
we had left the world a better place than we found it.

Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United

of  the  Republic  of  Burundi,  and  to  invite  him  to
address the Assembly.
President  Buyoya  (spoke  in  French):  It  is  an
honour  for  me  to  address  the  General  Assembly  at  its
fifty-seventh session. Let me first of all, Sir, discharge
a pleasant duty on behalf of my  delegation and  on  my
own  account,  and  extend 
to  you  my  warmest
congratulations  on  your  election  to  the  presidency  of
the Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. You may rest

for  the  able  manner  in  which  he  led  the  work  of  the
fifty-sixth session.

Furthermore, I would like to take this opportunity
to  express  our  gratitude  to  the  United  Nations,  and  to
pay  tribute  to  its  Secretary-General,  Mr.  Kofi  Annan,
for his support to the people of Burundi.
Nor can I fail to thank the Security Council for its
tireless efforts to find a lasting solution to the crisis in
Burundi.  Through  its  two  visits  to  Burundi,  the  latest
on 5 and 6 May 2002, the Security Council has shown
its solidarity with the people of Burundi in its quest for
peace.
During  my  address,  I  shall  inform  the  Assembly
of the political situation in Burundi, and of how far we
have  come  in  the  peace  process;  I  will  then  go  on  to
speak of the challenges we still face and will conclude
my  statement  with  some  comments  on  international
issues.

the  establishment  of 
transitional
institutions  beginning  1  November  2001,  the  political
climate in Burundi has greatly improved. The political

us  no  alternative.  We  are  pleased  to  recall  from  this
rostrum  that  we  have  chosen  the  option  of  peace
through  dialogue  and  the  procrastinations  of  others
involved in no way shake our conviction.
6
Since  we  are  on  the  right  path,  we  request  the
Secretary-General,  the  Security  Council,  the  African
Union  and  the  countries  of  our  subregion  to  maintain
their  support  for  our  quest  for  peace  by  assisting  the
mediation activities (cid:151) led by Nelson Mandela, assisted
by  Presidents  El  Hadj  Omar  Bongo  and  Benjamin
Mkapa  and  Vice-President  Jacob  Zuma  (cid:151)  in  order  to
persuade the protagonists to sign a ceasefire agreement
without further delay. Indeed, certain provisions of the
Arusha  Agreement  are  not  being  applied  precisely
because  of  the  ongoing  violence.  That  is  why  the
negotiation and signing of a ceasefire is a crucial stage
in  hastening  and  ensuring  the  success  of  the  many
reforms to be undertaken.
The  task  ahead  is  enormous,  but  it  can  be
accomplished. The smooth functioning of institutions is
a  guarantee  of  success,  while  daily  experience
demonstrates  the  serious  commitment  of  the  political
partners and is the basis of our optimism.
While it is true that there are reasons for hope, it
is equally true that the challenges to the peace process
are genuine and could compromise our path to peace if
they  are  not  satisfactorily  met  in  the  short  term.  The
violence  which  the  rebels  continue  to  force  on  the
Burundian  people  is  a  major  challenge  not  only  to  us,
but to the United Nations, whose primary mission is to
maintain peace throughout the world.

both individual and collective. That is why my country
is  prepared  to  continue  making  its  contribution  to
creating  a  better  climate  with  all  neighbouring
countries.
The second  major challenge is the reconstruction
effort.  After  nine  years  of  crisis, 
the  Burundian
economy  has  been  sorely  tried.  The  population  has
become further impoverished, all economic parameters
have  been  destabilized,  and  our  external  indebtedness
prevents us from resorting, as we have done in the past,
to  the  international  financial  marketplace.  Here  again,

Burundians  are  also  following  the  concerns  of  the
world,  which,  sadly,  are  many  and  to  which  we  are
constantly seeking solutions. To cite but a few, Burundi
welcomes  the  creation  of  the  Global  Fund  to  Fight
AIDS  and,  like  other  countries  that  have  been  deeply
affected by the  pandemic,  has requested  that  access  to
affordable  medicine  be  improved  until  such  time  as
researchers  are  able  to  develop  a  vaccine  against  this
scourge,  which  threatens  all  humankind,  especially  in
Africa.  In  the  same  vein,  my  delegation  supports  the
idea of creating a world fund to fight poverty and also
welcomes the proposal to establish a world fund for the
environment.
Even  closer  to  home,  our  peoples  await  the
concrete  results  of 
the  recent  World  Summit  on
Sustainable  Development  in  Johannesburg,  at  which
the community of  nations reaffirmed  the  need  to  work
together towards equitable and  viable development  for
current  and  future  generations.  We  also  welcome  the
establishment of the Office of the High Representative
for 
the  Least  Developed  Countries,  Landlocked
Developing  Countries  and  Small  Island  Developing
States. This testifies to the unequivocal commitment of
the  United  Nations  to  enhancing  and  focusing  efforts
on behalf of the most vulnerable groups of countries.
On the African continent, the New Partnership for
Africa(cid:146)s Development is a major source of hope and, as
such, deserves the support of the international financial
institutions and of the community of donors.
Along  with  the  poverty  that  is  affecting  millions
of  human  beings,  another  fearful  danger  is  that  of
terrorism.  A  year  after  the  terrorist  attacks  of  11
September  2001  in  New  York,  Washington,  D.C.,  and
Pennsylvania, the world remains in a state of shock and
is  seeking  ways  to  stem  the  scourge  of  international
terrorism.  To  that  end,  Burundi

The  President:  On  behalf  of 
the  General
Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United
Nations  His  Excellency  Mr.  Alvaro  Uribe  V횠lez,
President  of  the  Republic  of  Colombia,  and  to  invite
him to address the Assembly.
Mr. Uribe (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I greet
you,  Your  Excellency  Mr.  Jan  Kavan  of  the  Czech
Republic,  President  of  the  General  Assembly,  which  I
address for the first time.
A short distance from here, on the fateful day 11
September,  2,801  citizens  of 
the  world  died.  In
Colombia, violence claims the same number of victims
every  month.  Forty  three  million  Colombians,  peace-
loving  people,  are  experiencing  one  of  the  world(cid:146)s
worst humanitarian crises. Every year Colombia buries
34,000 of its own, victims of violence. We have lost 10
per cent of our youth. Last  year the  country  registered
the highest homicide rate in the world: 63 per 100,000
inhabitants.
During  the  past  five  years,  we  have  experienced
8,000  acts  of  collective  destruction,  more  than  those
recorded  for  any  other  cases  of  violence  in  the  world;
280  villages  were 
the  object  of  guerrilla  and

paramilitary  attacks  with  serious  consequences  for
local  civilians  and  the  armed  forces.  The  terrorist
attack carried out during my inaugural ceremony killed
21 ordinary people. Two million people, 40 per cent of
them  children,  have  been  forcibly  displaced  under
pressure from violent groups. That is the equivalent of
the  simultaneous  displacement  of  the  communities  of
Washington and Manhattan. During the past five years,
16,500 people have been kidnap victims. Yesterday, six
children were kidnapped and one of them is still being
held.
Just  as  the  11  September  terrorist  attacks  moved
the  entire  world  and  triggered  justified  and  universal
condemnation,  mankind  should  be  shaken  by  attacks
such  as  the  one  carried  out  by  guerrillas  on  2  May
2002,  in  Bojay횈,  a  village  of  1,000  inhabitants.  They
killed 117 civilians who had taken refuge in the church.
Such  violence  makes  our  people  poorer  every
day,  discourages 
investments,  hampers  economic
growth,  diverts  valuable  resources  and  prevents  us

the  painful  events  that  struck  the  United  States,  and
especially  our  host  city,  just  a  year  ago.  So  I  shall
begin by paying tribute to the memory of the victims of
the  attacks  of  11  September  2001.  This  sacrifice  is  a
cruel  reminder  of  how  fragile  our  world  remains,
exposed  to  the  most  unimaginable  threats.  Humankind

here,  through  me,  its  solidarity  with  the  people  of  the

Since  the  Millennium  Summit,  the  international
community has convened a number of meetings whose
objective  was  to  improve  the  lives  of  our  peoples
through  policies  of  shared  management,  of  solidarity
and of preserving the future in various areas involving
the responsibility of our States. We should periodically
evaluate our progress, and the current session offers us
that opportunity.
The absence of peace (cid:151) war and insecurity (cid:151) is
gravely  undermining  humanity.  Unfortunately,  no
region  in  the  world  has  been  spared.  Because  of
irrationality,  the  Middle  East,  a  veritable  powder  keg,
is  unravelling  before  us.  The  international  community
must  become  further  involved  in  the  talks  between
Palestinian  and  Israelis  in  order  to  put  an  end  to  the
cycle of violence that has ravaged that part of the world
for so long.
Our  own  subregion,  which  covers  the  Economic
Community of Central African States (cid:151) over which we
preside  (cid:151) 
longs  for  peace  and  security.  Having
suffered years of war and instability, Central Africa has
only  one  desire:  to  emerge  quickly  from  this  infernal
cycle. In that connection, we should firmly seize every
opportunity  available  to  us  in  order  permanently  to
reverse old trends.
In  Angola, 
the  4  April  2002  signing  of  a
Memorandum of Understanding as an addendum to the
Lusaka Protocol offers a glimmer of hope. We welcome
the  signing  of  that  agreement  and,  in  the  same  spirit,
make an earnest appeal to the international community
to  give  its  full  support  to  the  populations  of  those
countries faced with dire poverty.
The  situation  in  Burundi  remains  worrisome
despite  the  formation  of  a  Government  of  national
unity.  We  ask  the  parties  to  go  even  further  and  to
begin honest negotiations that could give South African
mediation,  which  we  encourage,  every  chance  of
success.
With  regard  to  the  Democratic  Republic  of  the
Congo,  we  welcome  the  peace  Agreement  of  30  July
2002, signed in Pretoria between  the  heads  of  State of
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of Rwanda.
We  also  see  as  a  positive  development  the  agreement
reached  a  few  days  ago  in  Luanda  between  the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda. By the
same  token,  we  encourage  the  efforts  of  the  Special
Representative  of 
the
Democratic Republic of the Congo aimed at concluding
an  inclusive  agreement  involving  all  the  sons  and

In the light of the foregoing,  I  should  like  to  ask

That  Committee  has  just  held  its  18th  ministerial

The  persistence  of  areas  of  tension  and  conflict

more  effective  in  responding  to  the  needs  of  the

Furthermore,  Madagascar 
the
mediation efforts undertaken by the United Nations for
the  settlement  of  conflicts  in  a  number  of  countries
throughout  Africa.  In  this  context,  I  wish  to  reiterate
the  profound  gratitude  of  the  Malagasy  people  for  the
role the United Nations agreed to play in resolving the
post-election  dispute  that  threatened  Madagascar.  This
crisis is now over and Madagascar is now experiencing
a new era full of hope.
We  are  convinced  that  sustainable  development
requires  the  consolidation  of  the  rule  of  law  and  the
establishment  of  good  governance.  Towards  this  end,
the new Government is taking all appropriate measures
for  the  sound  and  rational  management  of  public
finances  and  of  international  assistance.  Madagascar
has  given the  fight against  corruption  the  very  highest
priority. We have also taken the initiative to insure that
an effective policy is developed and applied in order to
tackle  this  evil  on  all  fronts.  Madagascar  supports
General Assembly resolution 55/61, through which our
General  Assembly  decided 
to  create  an  ad  hoc
committee  entrusted  with  negotiating  a  future  legal
instrument  against  corruption.  Our  country  is  awaiting
the conclusion of such an instrument in the near future,
in  order  to  fill  the  gaps  in  its  own  legal  system.  We
look  forward  with  considerable  interest  to  the  high-
level  Conference  in  Mexico  in  2003  for  signing  a
convention against corruption.
The 
rapid  and  sustainable  development  of
Madagascar is the  major and  fundamental objective of
the present Government, in order to extract the country
from the scourge of poverty, a source of instability that
erodes  democratic  values.  In  this  context,  Madagascar
is  committed  to  a  pro-active  policy  aimed  at  recovery
for  rapid  and  sustainable  growth  of  its  economy,  in
which the private sector will be the driving force.

innocent 
Yesterday  we  heard  the  extraordinary  claim  in
this  Assembly  that  the  brutal  murder  of  innocent
civilians  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir  is  actually  a  freedom
struggle and that the forthcoming elections in that state
are  a  farce,  since  they  cannot  be  a  substitute  for  a
plebiscite  demanded  over  50  years  ago.  It  requires  an
effort  of  acrobatic  logic  to  believe  that  the  carnage
among innocents is an instrument for freedom and that
elections  are  a  symbol  of  deception  and  repression.  If
the elections are a mere fraud, why are terrorists being
trained  and  infiltrating  India  at  the  command  of  the
Inter-Services  Intelligence  Agency  of  Pakistan  to  kill
election candidates and to intimidate voters?
A/57/PV.4
If  Pakistan  claims  to  be  a  crucial  partner  in  the
international  coalition  against  terrorism,  how  can  it
continue  to  use  terrorism  as  an  instrument  of  State
policy against India?
Mr.  Nguyen  Dy  Nien  (Viet  Nam),  Vice-President,
took the Chair.
How  can  the  international  coalition  condone
Pakistan-directed  killings  of  thousands  of  innocent
civilians  (cid:151)  women  and  children  included  (cid:151) 
to
promote a bizarre version of self-determination? Those
who  speak  of  underlying  or  root  causes  of  terrorism
offer  alibis  to  the  terrorists  and  absolve  them  of
responsibility  for their  heinous  actions,  such  as  the  11
September  attacks  on  the  United  States  or  the  13
December attack on our Parliament.
Yesterday we heard yet another patently false and
self-serving  claim  that  in  India  Muslims  and  other
minorities are the target of Hindu extremists. With 150
million  Muslims,  India  has  the  second  largest  Muslim
population  in  the  world;  greater  than  that  of  Pakistan.
We  are  proud  of  the  multi-religious  character  of  our
society.  Equal 
faiths  and  non-
discrimination on the basis of religion are not just part
of  our  Constitutional  obligations,  but,  as  the  whole
world  knows,  they  are  the  signature  theme  of  India(cid:146)s
civilization and culture.
for  all 
respect 
We  have  to  recognize  that  the  developmental
divide  between  the  North  and  the  South  is  becoming
wider  and  deeper  by  the  day.  The  challenges  that  face
us  are  stark,  and  there  is  no  alternative  to  having  all
countries of the world join hands to face them together.
Over the last decade, 10 million people have been
joining the ranks of the poor each year. A quarter of the
world(cid:146)s population lives in extreme poverty.
We  have  to  find  US$  24  billion  annually  for
investment  in  poor  countries,  if  we  are  to  achieve  the
World Food Summit goal of halving hunger by 2015.
The continuation of widespread poverty, at a time
when  unimaginable  wealth  is  concentrated  in  a  small
social  layer,  is  totally  unacceptable.  The  twenty-first
century has all the means to end this sad legacy of the
past  centuries.  What  is  lacking  is  the  political  will

As  we  come  together  once  again  at  the  United
Nations,  at  a  time  of  new  and  diverse  challenges,  we
should  reflect  on  our  collective  commitment  to  the
Charter, its purposes and principles. There is a growing
perception,  particularly  among  the  weaker  and  poorer
countries,  that  responses  to  issues  of  far-reaching
impact often seem arbitrary and contradictory.
A  common  destiny  is  at  stake.  The  world  needs
collective multilateralism. It needs the United Nations,
the  coming  together  and  working  together  of  all  its
nations in the development of a common and collective
perspective.

Conflicts  arise  when 
is  no  spirit  of

India(cid:146)s own experience as a hugely populated and
diverse  nation  shows  how  complex  problems  can  be
addressed  within  a  constitutional  and  democratic
framework.
These  values  need  to  be  assiduously  nurtured  in
our  societies,  so that  at  least  a  future  generation  is  rid

and religious extremism.

The  Peace  Bell  in  the  garden  of  United  Nations
Headquarters  was  presented  to  the  United  Nations  in
1954  by  the  Japanese  people  with  a  prayer  for  world
peace. It has been rung every year for world peace. The
beautiful sound of the bell, which was made from coins
collected  from  all  over  the  world,  reminds  us  of  what
the United Nations represents.
In order to ensure world peace and prosperity, we
need to harmonize a range of efforts which encompass
not  only  military  measures,  but  also  initiatives  for  the
solution  of  poverty  problems  and  the  establishment  of
social  infrastructures  that  will  put  an  end  to  human
rights  violations.  The  United  Nations  should  be  a
forum where the contributions of each and every State
are consolidated and implemented in the most efficient
manner. No single State or organization can accomplish
this. Only the United Nations is capable of carrying out
such a lofty task.

In  this  connection,  I  would  like  to  refer  to  the
issue  of  Iraq,  which  is  of  grave  concern  to  the

Terrorism  remains  a  critical  issue  this  year.
Today, in addition to terrorism, I would like to take up
other  major challenges  which the United Nations  must
address  and  to  describe  Japan(cid:146)s  contributions  in  those
areas,  namely,  the  consolidation  of  peace  and  nation-
building, 
the  environment  and  development,  and
nuclear  disarmament.  I  will  also  touch  upon  my  ideas
for  the  realization  of  United  Nations  reform,  which  is
essential  in  order  for  this  Organization  to  tackle  these
challenges successfully.
The  first  challenge  is  the  fight  against  terrorism.
Just  after  the  terrorist  attacks  on  11  September,  I
visited  ground  zero.  Seeing  with  my  own  eyes  the
magnitude  of  the  destruction,  I  was  speechless  at  the
enormity  of  the  terrorist  attack.  11  September  is  a
challenge not only to the  United  States,  but also  to  all
humankind.  The  prevention  and  eradication  of
terrorism  are an important task  for  the  United  Nations
and, indeed, for all Member States.
to  accede 
Japan  calls  upon  all  States 
to
international  conventions  related  to  terrorism.  It  is
important  to  develop  international  norms  in  this  area,
such  as  a  comprehensive  convention  on  international
terrorism  and  an  international  convention  for  the
suppression  of  acts  of  nuclear  terrorism.  Safe  havens
for  terrorists  cannot  be  allowed.  Japan  will  further
strengthen  its  domestic  counter-terrorism  measures.
Consulting 
the  Counter-Terrorism
Committee  of  the  Security  Council,  it  will  share  its
knowledge and expertise in counter-terrorism measures
with  those  States  that  are  in  need  of  it.  Japan  will
respond  to  threats  where  weapons  of  mass  destruction
might  be  used  in  acts  of  terrorism  by  actively  joining
the  efforts  of  the  international  community  to  prevent
the proliferation of these weapons.

The  second  challenge  is  the  consolidation  of
peace  and  nation-building. 
Japan  attaches  great
importance to extending post-conflict assistance for the
consolidation  of  peace  and  nation-building  to  prevent
the  recurrence  of  conflicts.  Having  developed  a
mechanism  to  enable  it  to  cooperate  effectively  in
broader  areas,  Japan  has  entered  a  new  stage  in  its
cooperation  with  peacekeeping  operations.  This
positive  posture  is  manifested  in  its  deployment  since
February of 690 Self-Defence Force personnel,  mainly
as an engineer group, to the peacekeeping operation in
East Timor. Japan will enhance its cooperation in other
areas  as  well,  such  as  demining,  rehabilitation  of
infrastructure,  elections  and 
the  establishment  of
systems for internal security.
The President returned to the Chair.
Concerning  Afghanistan,  at 
on  Reconstruction  Assistance 
the  International
Conference 
to
Afghanistan  held  in  Tokyo  in  January,  Japan  strove  to
solidify the resolve of the international community. We
are  now  preparing  a  programme 
the
demobilization and reintegration of former combatants,
which  will  give  form  to  our  proposed  Register  for
Peace.  My  country  is  also  contributing  to  regional
reconstruction  by  developing  an  assistance  project  for
the  resettlement  of  refugees  and  displaced  people  in
such areas as Kandahar.
to  assist 
In the Middle East, it is crucial that the vision of
the  peaceful  coexistence  of  Israel  and  an  independent
Palestinian State materialize as early as possible. Japan
will  assist  the  reform  of  the  Palestinian  Authority,
which is  aimed  at  the establishment  of  a  new  State  by
the  Palestinian  people.  We  will  do  so  particularly  by
providing 
technical  assistance  for  democratization.
Elections by the  Palestinians are  the  first  step  towards
nation-building  and  I  believe  that  the  international
community  should  extend  assistance  to  ensure  their
success.  However,  putting  an  end  to  the  vicious  circle
of  violence  remains  our  most  urgent  task.  Japan
resolutely  condemns 
terrorist  acts  by  Palestinian
extremists  and  strongly  urges  Israel  to  immediately
withdraw its troops to the line of September 2000, halt
its military operations and lift the economic closures in
the autonomous areas.
In Africa, peace and stability are prerequisites for
development.  We  are  encouraged  by 
the  positive
movements in that continent, such as the realization of
peace in Angola and a partial ceasefire in Sudan. Japan

important to utilize all available financial resources and
to  develop  human  resources,  which  are  the  engine  of
nation-building.  However,  ownership  by  developing
countries  and  their  partnership  with  the  international
community,  which  supports  their  ownership,  are  also
essential.
In  this  respect,  we  welcome  the  development  of
the  New  Partnership 
for  Africa(cid:146)s  Development
(NEPAD)  and  the  establishment  of  the  African  Union
as manifestations of ownership by African countries. In
order  to  help  strengthen  both  African  ownership  and
the  partnership  with  the  international  community,  and
building on the results of the successful World Summit
on  Sustainable  Development 
in
Johannesburg,  Japan  will  convene  the  third  Tokyo
International  Conference  on  African  Development
(TICAD  III)  in  October  2003.  Also,  in  pursuit  of
sustainable  development,  it  will  host  an  international
ministerial-level  conference  on  water  in  Kyoto  in
March 2003. Japan will continue to participate actively
in  worldwide actions for environmental protection and

Fourthly,  I  would  like  to  touch  upon  the  nuclear
disarmament  issue.  I  believe  that  Japan,  as  the  only
country  in  human  history  to  have  suffered  nuclear
devastation,  has  a  significant  role  to  play  in  nuclear
disarmament and non-proliferation. Japan will continue
its  efforts to realize a  peaceful and  safe  world,  free  of
nuclear  weapons, as early  as  possible. To that  end,  we
will  propose  a  draft  resolution  entitled  (cid:147)A  path  to  the
total elimination of nuclear weapons(cid:148) at this session of
the General Assembly, and we will redouble our efforts
to  achieve 
the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.
the  early  entry 
force  of 
into 
When  addressing 
these  challenges,  we  must
ensure  that  the  variety  of  measures  taken  by  Member
States are  effectively  coordinated.  The  United  Nations
must exercise its leadership in this endeavour. We, that
is  all  Member  States,  must  breathe  new  life  into  the
United  Nations  by  strengthening  its  functions  through
reforms. Next  year,  the  debate  on  Security  Council
reform will enter its tenth year. I believe that we should
now  focus  our  discussion  on  such  questions  as  the
number of seats on an enlarged Security Council. Japan
intends  to  work  hard  to  that  end.  In  this  connection,  I
would remind all Member States of the question of the
(cid:147)enemy  State(cid:148)  clauses,  meaningless  legacies  of  the
twentieth  century,  that  remain  in  the  United  Nations
Charter.
Since assuming office as Prime  Minister in  April
2001,  I  have  proceeded  with  a  series  of  reforms  to
enable  Japan  to  respond  appropriately  to  the  new  era.
The United Nations also must continue to reform itself
so  as  to  respond  to  new  situations  in  the  world  by
constantly  reviewing  its  organization  and  functions.
The  prescription  for  reform  is  already  shown  in  the
Millennium  Declaration.  In  order  to  achieve  the  goals
contained in the Declaration and build a more peaceful,
prosperous and just world, every Member State should
renew its determination to achieve reform in the United
Nations  and  take  actions  toward  that  end.  Japan  will
make  its  utmost  efforts  to  ensure  that  the  United
Nations  is  able  to  meet  the  challenges  of  the  twenty-
first century.

In  contrast  to  previous  years,  when  the  General
Assembly  listened  to  a  litany  of  horror  stories  out  of
Africa, I am happy to note that substantial and positive
developments are  taking  place  on  the  continent.  There
is a  new  dawn  in  Africa  and the  stark  realization  that,
without  enduring  peace  and  stability,  there  will  be  no
sustainable development.
We  congratulate  the  African  leaders  who  have
spared  no  effort  in  the  search  for  African  solutions  to
African  conflicts  and  crises.  The  Pretoria  Agreement
between  Presidents  Kabila  and  Kagame  represents  a
major  breakthrough  for  the  peace  process  in  the  Great
Lakes  region.  We  are  aware  that  the  implementation
will  be  difficult.  We  are,  however,  confident  that  the
international  community  will  provide  all  necessary
assistance  to  the  leaders  in  the  region  for  a  smooth
implementation.

The  launching  of  the  African  Union  in  Durban,
South  Africa,  in  July  this  year  was  indeed  a  historic
and  emotionally  charged  occasion.  The  birth  of  the
African Union heralds a new era of political, economic
and  social 
transformation  for  our  continent.  The
continent  is  more  than  ever  determined  to  shape  its
destiny  and  to  tackle  comprehensively  the  burning
problems 
and
underdevelopment  that  have  debilitated  millions  of
Africans over the  years. The  African  Union  has raised
expectations  that  we,  as  leaders,  are  committed  to
honour. The African Union will be able to respond in a
positive  manner  to  the  challenges  confronting  it,  as
well  as  maximizing 
the
improvement of the lives of peoples of the continent. In
that  context,  the  decision  of  African  countries  to  take
responsibility  for peacekeeping  on the  continent  needs
to  be  encouraged.  Since  the  burden  of  peacekeeping
must  be  equitably  shared,  I  am  pleased  to  announce
that  Mauritius  will  contribute  to  the  United  Nations
civilian police for service in post-conflict operations.

from  the  start  and  will  continue  to  do  so  to  the  end,
enhancing  the  military,  financial,  judicial,  police  and
intelligence  cooperation  that  has  already  achieved
important results. But we are also working to eradicate
poverty  and  disease.  We  are  committed  to  pledging
0.39  per  cent  of  our  gross  domestic  product  to  less
developed  countries,  and  we  intend  to  reach  the  level
of 0.7 per cent.
The African continent is crucial to our effort. It is
a  challenge  to  our  conscience  and  represents  a  test  of
our  ability to  help its  countries  to  participate  in  a  true
development without borders.
The  Group  of  Eight(cid:146)s  action  plan  for  Africa,
launched 
in  Genoa  under  Italy(cid:146)s  presidency  and
approved  in  Canada,  responds  to  the  need  for  a  new
form  of  solidarity  between  the  most  industrialized
countries and those which intend to become the owners
of their future.
But  an  increase  in  financial  aid  is  no  longer
enough.  At  the  Kananaskis  summit,  we  presented  an
action  plan  aimed  at  achieving  common  standards  of
good  governance,  starting  with  our  (cid:147)e-government(cid:148)
initiative,  a  completely  computerized  and  digitalized
universal  model  of  public  accounting  and  of  public
administration and its primary functions.
The  adoption  of  this  universal  model,  which
respects  the  identity,  traditions  and  culture  of  each
country,  could  produce  several  positive  effects:  clear
and  transparent  public  accounting;  clear  laws  and
regulations  befitting  the  rule  of  law;  more  efficient
services  for  citizens  and  businesses;  greater  efficiency
in  public  administration;  and,  above  all,  greater
democracy. This will spark a virtuous circle, and donor
countries  will  finally  have  the  certainty  that  their
assistance is truly delivered to needy populations.
In  this  respect,  three  phases  were  outlined  at  the
Group  of  Eight  meeting.  In  the  first  trial  stage,  the
necessary  assistance  will  be  provided  to  the  countries
that wish to adopt this system. At the end of this phase,
which  might  last  three  or  four  years,  we  can  move  on
to  a  second  phase  in  which  the  adoption  of  the
universal  system  becomes  a  requirement 
for  all
countries that apply for development assistance.
Finally, there could be a third phase in which we
could  ask  the  most  industrialized  countries  to  forge  a
special  partnership  with  specific  countries,  taking  it
upon themselves to implement specific projects.
We  are  likewise  convinced  that  public  assistance
should  be  supplemented  by  private  assistance.  At
Kananaskis,  we  submitted  an 
innovative  proposal
called (cid:147)de-tax(cid:148), whereby private citizens would be able
to  allocate  between  1  and  2  per  cent  of  the  price  of
what  they  buy  to  the  implementation  of  specific
projects,  such  as  schools,  hospitals  or  water-supply
facilities in poor countries.
At  Genoa  we  also  launched  the  (cid:147)Education  for
All(cid:148)  plan  and 
to  Fight  AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria, to which Italy has pledged a
substantial contribution.
the  Global  Fund 
But the poorer  countries  also  need  to  be relieved
of  the  burden  of  their  debt  so  as  to  free  up  the
resources they need for their growth. That is why Italy
has  already  cancelled  $1  billion  of  debt  and  will  soon
cancel  another  $4  billion,  until  the  complete  write-off
of all its credits.
Our commitment to the United Nations is clear on
all  fronts.  Italy  is  the  sixth-largest  contributor  to  the
Organization(cid:146)s  regular  budget  and  one  of  the  largest
troop  contributors.  About  10,000  Italian  soldiers  are
deployed  throughout  the  world,  from  the  Balkans  to
Afghanistan,  to  preserve  and  maintain  peace  and
security.  We  will  continue along  that  road,  in  our  firm
belief  that  there is  no  problem  that  we  cannot  solve  if
we are united in our determination.
As  we  speak  today,  the  main  challenge  to  the
United  Nations  and  our  system  of  values  is  posed  by
the regime that governs Iraq,  which has systematically
ignored  all  the  resolutions  of  the  United  Nations.  A
response is indispensable to safeguard the international
community from the danger posed by a massive build-
up of weapons of mass destruction.

As  President  Bush  so  clearly  stated,  what  we
must  address  today  is  precisely  this  repeated  defiance
of 
the
international community.  We  must  make  use  of  all  the
diplomatic and political means available to address this
situation.  But  if  things  do  not  change  substantially,  it
will  be  necessary  to  act  within  the  framework  of  the
United  Nations  in  order  to  safeguard  global  security
from a real threat.

consequences.  When  terrorist  attacks  or  threats  to

Let me now turn our attention to the Middle East.
Italy supports the road map drawn up by the European
Union,  as  well  as  the  action  of  the  (cid:147)quartet(cid:148)  and  the
rapid  convening  of  an  international  conference  to
ensure  the  peaceful  coexistence  of  two  independent
States within safe and secure borders.
First of all, the spiral of violence must come to an
end  through  the  cessation  of  terrorist  attacks.  The
holding  of  free  and  fair  elections  will  advance  the
process  of  democratic  reform  of 
the  Palestinian
National  Authority.  But  a  lasting  peace  cannot  be
envisaged unless we narrow the economic gap between
the Israelis and the Palestinians, giving the Palestinians
realistic hope for jobs and development. With this goal
in  mind,  Italy  has  presented  a  plan  to  rebuild  and
support  the  Palestinian  economy.  Italy  has  already

committed  to  the  fight  against  terrorism,  and  we  will
do everything in our power to eradicate that evil and to
defend  our  security  and  our  future.  We  will  lend  our
efforts to the building of a true and just peace, the only
kind of peace for the just and the free.
The  President: On  behalf  of 
the  General
Assembly,  I  thank  the  Prime  Minister  of  the  Italian
Republic for the statement he has just made.

The  President: I  now  give  the  floor  to  His
Excellency  The  Honourable  Alexander  Downer,
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia.
Mr.  Downer  (Australia):  Let  me  begin  by
congratulating  you,  Sir,  on  your  election  as  President
of  the  General  Assembly  at  its  fifty-seventh  session.  I
am  also  pleased  to  welcome  Switzerland  as  a  new
Member of the United Nations.

Let  me  acknowledge  also  two  other  significant
developments: the establishment of the African Union,
and  the  creation  of  the  New  Partnership  for  Africa(cid:146)s
Development.  Both  raise  real  hope  for  a  new  era  of
political stability and economic growth for Africa.
We meet at this General Assembly in the shadow
of the  terrorist attacks  on  this  great  city  one  year  ago.
Those  chilling  events  were  an  attack  on  the  values  of
the  great  civilizations  represented  here  today,  values
that  are central  to  the  United  Nations  Charter  and  this
Organization.
We  can  take  some  comfort  in  knowing  that  the
international  community  has  responded,  deliberately
and resolutely, to international terrorism. The coalition
in the war against terrorism (cid:151) led by the United States
and  joined  by  others,  including  Australia  (cid:151)  has
accomplished  a  great  deal.  The  Al  Qaeda  network  in
Afghanistan has been disabled. The Taliban regime has
been  defeated.  Now  the  world  is  a  safer  and  more
humane place.
But  terrorism  cannot  be  stamped  out  by  military
effort  alone.  Together  we  must  choke  off  support  (cid:151)
financial and otherwise (cid:151) for terrorism. We must stop
the  patrons  and  bankrollers  of  the  trade  in  terror,  and
together  face 
threat.  The  decisive
response  of  the  United  Nations  after  11  September,
embodied  in  Security  Council  resolution  1373  (2001),
created  a  framework  for  Member  States  to  join  forces
in suppressing, prosecuting and punishing terrorist acts
and terrorist financing.

We  face  another  grave  threat  to  international
peace and security, one that tests  the  very  authority  of
the United Nations. For over a decade, Iraq has flouted
legally binding obligations to disclose and eradicate its
programmes for weapons of mass destruction. Iraq has
defied  United  Nations  resolutions,  United  Nations
inspections  and  United  Nations  sanctions,  and  it  has
ignored  some  23  of  the  27  United  Nations  obligations
imposed  on  it  under  16  Security  Council  resolutions.
The  Secretary-General  has  been  patient,  flexible  and
24
assiduous  in  his  efforts  to  get  Iraq  to  comply  with
Council resolutions. But Iraq has refused to  work  with
the  United  Nations 
its
programmes for weapons of mass destruction.

Until  this  occurs,  Iraq  is  a  grave  threat  to  its
neighbours  and  to  the  world.  Iraq(cid:146)s  well  documented
aggression  towards  its  neighbours  and  its  past  use  of
chemical weapons underline the potency of the threat it
poses.  Grave  concerns  remain  about  Iraq(cid:146)s  present
capabilities.
Up until 1998 United Nations weapons inspectors
did  much  good  work  in  finding  and  destroying  Iraq(cid:146)s
weapons of mass destruction program. But the work of
the  United  Nations  Special  Commission  (UNSCOM)
was  never  finished,  because  in  1998  the  inspectors
were  effectively  thrown  out  of  Iraq.  Four  years  later,
there is little doubt that Iraq has been  working hard to
rebuild 
biological  weapons
programmes.  Moreover,  serious  questions  also  remain
about Iraq(cid:146)s nuclear weapons programme.

unrestricted access to inspectors to  all areas,  facilities,

must  fulfil  the  requirements  of  all  relevant  Security
Council resolutions. If Iraq has nothing to hide, then it
has nothing to fear. Indeed, by meeting these demands,
Iraq and its people have everything to gain.
Let  us  also  be  very  clear:  Iraq(cid:146)s  flagrant  and
persistent  defiance  is  a  direct  challenge  to  the  United
Nations,  to  the  authority  of  the  Security  Council,  to
international  law,  and  to  the  will  of  the  international
community.
We  cannot  stand  by  and  allow  ourselves  to  be
ignored.  Nor  must  protracted  negotiations  be  allowed
to weaken and eventually paralyse efforts to allay fears
about Iraq(cid:146)s weapons of mass destruction. We all  must
demonstrate a clear, collective determination to uphold
the authority of the Security Council, and to ensure that
its  resolutions  on  Iraq  are 
in  full.
Otherwise, if Iraq(cid:146)s pursuit of these abhorrent weapons
is  allowed  to  continue,  we  may  shortly  be  asking
ourselves why we failed to act.

The terrorist threat has given new urgency to our
disarmament  and  non-proliferation  goals,  and  puts
demands  on  us  for a  renewed  effort to  stop  the  spread
of  weapons  of  mass  destruction  (cid:151)  both  to  non-state
and state actors. We have to be alive to the willingness
of  terrorist  groups  to  develop  and  use  chemical,
biological or nuclear weapons.

have arrived at this point owes much to the resolve and

necessary  support,  not  just  for  peacekeeping  and

We also need to think again about the relationship
between these organs and the Secretariat: time is not a
free  good,  nor  are  meeting  services,  nor  are  the
Secretary-General(cid:146)s  reports,  and  nor  is  the  capacity  or
will  of  Member  States  to  provide  resources  without
limits. We need to look at how we can more effectively
use existing Unite Nations mechanisms (cid:151) particularly
the  General  Assembly  and 
the  United  Nations
Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) (cid:151) as bodies
of review. And we are especially concerned that  major
United  Nations  conferences  have  become  so  large  and
unwieldy  that  their  fundamental  purposes  have  been
obscured.
Australia strongly supports the process of reform
proposed by the Secretary-General for his second term.
This  provides  a  unique  opportunity  to  address  these
questions  and  to  (cid:147)re-tool(cid:148)  the  Organization  so  as  to
build  on  its  strengths.  As  Member  States,  we  are  the
United Nations. The Organization is there to serve our
collective interests.
In  order  to  address  new  threats  and  challenges,
the  United  Nations  must  be  focused  and  responsive,
and  its  key  organs  must  function  efficiently  and
effectively.  We  must  continue  to  work  together  to
enable  it  to  meet  our  expectations.  I  am  confident
that (cid:151) together (cid:151) we can achieve success.
The  President:  I  now  call  on  His  Excellency
Mr. Joseph  Deiss,  the  Federal  Councillor and  Minister
for Foreign Affairs of Switzerland.
Mr.  Deiss  (Switzerland)  (spoke  in  French):  It  is
imperative,  now  more  than  ever  before,  that  all  the
peoples  of  the  world  act  in  a  spirit  of  solidarity.  The
United  Nations  embodies  this  spirit.  In  joining  the
United  Nations,  Switzerland  sends  you  a  message  of
solidarity. This makes me proud and happy.
I would like to add my thanks to those expressed
last  Tuesday  by  Kaspar  Villiger,  the  President  of  the
Swiss  Confederation, on the occasion of  Switzerland(cid:146)s
formal  admission  to  the  United  Nations.  I  would  also
like to thank all the Members of the United Nations for
the  warm  welcome  they  have  given  my  country.
Switzerland feels welcomed. We feel that we are where
we belong.
I  would  also  like  to  give  Secretary-General  Kofi
Annan  my  profound  thanks.  His  sincerity  and  wisdom

service of the United Nations. Switzerland is pleased to
be  working  with  you  towards  the  success  of  this
session of the General Assembly.
The Swiss people have decided to join the United

are immense. A number of regions suffer from terrible
poverty.  Crises  and  wars  are  rife  on  all  continents.
There are millions of refugees. We see the hideous face
of  terrorism.  Criminal  networks  exploit  human  beings
and traffic shamefully in drugs and arms. New diseases
are emerging and, day after day, we continue to destroy
the Earth(cid:146)s ecological balance.
There  are  no  simple  answers  to  any  of  these
problems, but there is a place where we can all meet to
find  solutions:  the  United  Nations.  The  world  needs  a
strong  United  Nations,  as  it  is  the  only  universal
Organization  working  at  the  global  level.  It  alone  can
analyse problems at the world level. It alone can create
a consensus between States on common goals. Finally,

Switzerland  has  joined  the  United  Nations  as  a
neutral  country  and  we  intend  to  remain  neutral.  Our
neutral  status,  however,  in  no  way  diminishes  our
desire  for  cooperation.  On  the  contrary,  it  is  an
advantage for our peace activities. Our  membership of
the United Nations is not a change in direction, but the
logical consequence of our foreign policy.
To

our  Constitution, 
Swiss
Confederation  is  committed  (cid:133)  to  a  just  and  peaceful
international  order(cid:148).  The  principal  aim  of  the  United
Nations is to maintain international peace and security.
For us, therefore, the United Nations is the ideal place
to  carry  out  this  vital  mission.  As  a  Member  of  the
United  Nations,  Switzerland  will  devote 
itself
resolutely  to  international  peace  and  security.  That
commitment  will  be  focused,  above  all,  on  armed
conflicts. The  logic of armed  conflicts today  forces  us
to  adopt  a  multidimensional  approach 
to  peace
processes.  If  we  are  to  succeed,  we  must  work  in
several different areas in parallel:  military, diplomatic,
humanitarian  and  economic.  We  must  also  involve  all
interested  players  in  the  process.  All  this  demands  a
major  effort  of  coordination,  and  Switzerland  will
contribute to that.
Security  problems,  moreover,  must  be  addressed
from  a  broader  angle  (cid:151)  that  of  human  security.  The
inhabitants  of  this  world  must  be  able  to  live  without
fear of war, starvation and despotism. In particular, we
must  protect  vulnerable
