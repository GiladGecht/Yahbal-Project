Reports of the First Committee
The  Acting  President: The  General  Assembly
will  consider  the  reports  of  the  First  Committee  on
agenda items 57 to 73.
I  request  the  Rapporteur  of  the  First  Committee,
Mr. Mehmet Samsar of Turkey, to introduce the reports
of the First Committee in one intervention.
Mr.  Samsar  (Turkey),  Rapporteur  of  the  First
Committee:  I  have  the  great  pleasure  and  honour  to
and
present 
International  Security  Committee  — 
the  First
Committee  —  under  agenda  items  57  to  73  to  the
General Assembly for its consideration and approval.

Semakula  Kiwanuka, 
The  Committee,  under 
the  chairmanship  of
Ambassador 
Permanent
Representative of Uganda, considered 17 agenda items,
which  encompass  a  total  of  36  items  related  to
disarmament and international security issues, in a very
constructive and efficient manner.
One can  characterize  the  fifty-seventh  session  of
the  First  Committee  as  procedurally  complicated,  but
substantively  constructive,  more  focused  and  action-
oriented.  I  can  say  that  the  disarmament  calendar  for
2002  has  been  eventful.  During  the  session,  member
the 
issues 
ranging  across 
States  addressed 
full
spectrum  of  disarmament  and  related  international
security  agenda  items.  Most  of  the  delegations  that
participated in the deliberations of the Committee paid
tribute to  the  achievements  of  recent  years,  as  well  as
expressing their legitimate concern and their readiness
to cooperate in tackling issues that should be addressed
in the near future.
As in the past, the complexity of nuclear issues in
general,  encompassing  both  nuclear  disarmament  and
non-proliferation,  continued  to  constitute  the  core  of
the  debate  on  international  security.  Among  these
issues,  in  general,  those  related  to  weapons  of  mass
destruction  —  in  particular,  nuclear  disarmament  and
non-proliferation; positive developments in the nuclear
arena,  notably  the  Strategic  Offensive  Reductions
Treaty between the Russian Federation and the United
States; and questions related to other types of weapons
of  mass  destruction,  such  as  biological  and  chemical
weapons  —  continued  to  dominate  the  attention  of
many  delegations.  Despite 
the  persistence  of
considerable differences on certain specific substantive
issues,  there  seemed  to  be  consensus  on  many  of  the
broader  and  fundamental  objectives  of  multilateral
disarmament and non-proliferation issues.
The  Committee  had  before  it  for  consideration  a
total  of  52  draft  resolutions  and  2  draft  decisions  that
were  submitted  under  various  disarmament  and
international  security  issues.  It  adopted  a  total  of  50
draft  resolutions  and  2  draft  decisions,  of  which  29
draft  resolutions  and  1  draft  decision  were  adopted

resolution,

and 
In  this  connection,  I  wish  to  state  that  the
Committee  adopted  five  new  draft  resolutions  on:
bilateral strategic nuclear arms reductions and the new
strategic framework; reduction of non-strategic nuclear
weapons;  national  legislation  on  transfer  of  arms,
military equipment and dual use goods and technology;
measures to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons
of  mass  destruction;  and  promotion  of  multilateralism
in  the  area  of  disarmament  and  non-proliferation.  Of
these,  three  were  adopted  by  a  recorded  vote  and  two
by consensus.
I would like to pay a well-deserved tribute to all
delegations  for  their  spirit  of  cooperation  in  the
common  search  for  a  better,  safer  and  more  stable
world. I would also like to express my sincere gratitude
to  the  Chairman  of  the  First  Committee,  Ambassador
Matia  Mulumba  Semakula  Kiwanuka,  who,  with  his
high  diplomatic 
skills  and  vast  knowledge  of
disarmament and international security affairs, skilfully
steered  the  deliberations  of  the  First  Committee  and
enriched its debate with his vision and able guidance.

I  would  also 
to  extend  my  cordial
appreciation  and  thanks  to  the  Vice-Chairmen  of  the
Committee,  Ambassador  José  Nicolás  Rivas  of
Colombia,  Mr.  Jamal  Nassir  Al-Bader  of  Qatar  and
Mr. Razvan  Rusu  of  Romania,  all  of  whom  played  a
constructive  role  in  the  discharge  of  our  common
responsibilities.
I wish  further  to  thank  the  Secretary  of  the  First
Committee, Mr. Mohammad Kasem Sattar, whose vast
experience  and  high  degree  of  competence  made  a
significant  contribution  to  the  successful  outcome  of
the work of the Committee. I would also like to express
my gratitude to Mr. Timur Alasaniya, Mr. Saijin Zhang.
Mr.  Tam  Chung,  Ms.  Ruby  Kulanusorstit,  Ms.  Janett
Serrano,  Mr.  Eduard  Fesko  and  other  Secretariat  staff
for  their  valuable  assistance  in  the  preparation  of  the
reports, as well as in the work of the Committee. Allow
me to state that, as Rapporteur of the Committee, I had
the good fortune to become acquainted with the  many
unknown soldiers working diligently in the Secretariat,

who deserve our highest admiration and gratitude for a
job well done.
In  conclusion,  I  submit  the  reports  of  the  First
Committee,  as  contained  in  documents  A/57/501  to
A/57/517,  to  the  General  Assembly  for  consideration
and approval.
The  Acting  President:  If  there  is  no  proposal
under rule 66 of the  rules  of  procedure,  I  shall  take  it
that  the  General  Assembly  decides  not  to  discuss  the
reports  of  the  First  Committee  which  are  before  the
Assembly today.
It was so decided.
The Acting President: Statements will therefore
be  limited  to  explanations  of  vote  or  position.  The

Committee  or  in  plenary  meeting,  unless  that
delegation’s  vote  in  plenary  meeting  is  different
from its vote in the Committee”.
May I remind delegations that, also in accordance
with  General  Assembly  decision  34/401,  explanations
of vote  are  limited  to  10  minutes  and  should  be  made
by delegations from their seats.

recommendations  contained  in  the  reports  of  First
Committee, I should like to advise representatives that
we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same
manner  as  was  done  in  the  First  Committee,  unless
notified  otherwise  in  advance.  That  means  that  where
recorded  or  separate  votes  were  taken,  we  will  do  the
same. I should also hope that we may proceed to adopt
without  a  vote  those  recommendations  that  were
adopted without a vote in the First Committee.

Report of the First Committee (A/57/510)
The  President: The  Assembly  has  before  it
twenty-nine draft resolutions recommended by the First
Committee  in  paragraph  90  of  its  report.  One  draft
decision recommended is in paragraph 91 of the  same
report.

resolution
A/C.1/57/L.3/Rev.1,  included  as  draft  resolution  B  in
document  A/57/510.  The  sponsors  of

resolution  warmly  welcome  the  accession  by  Cuba  to
the  Treaty  on 
the  Non-Proliferation  of  Nuclear
Weapons  (NPT)  and  its  ratification  of  the  Treaty  of
Tlatelolco.
When the draft resolution was adopted in the First
Committee on 25 October 2002, Cuba had signalled its
intention  to  assume  these  obligations.  However,  all
necessary  procedures  could  not  be  completed  before
the First Committee concluded its work. The sponsors
of  the  draft  resolution  are  agreed  that  it  would  be
appropriate to reflect these developments in the text to

Mr. Mourao (Brazil): Since the First Committee,
by  an  overwhelming  majority  adopted  draft  resolution
A/C.1/57/L.34, entitled “Nuclear-weapon-free southern
hemisphere and adjacent areas”, Cuba has deposited in
Mexico  City  the  instruments  of  ratification  of  the

envisaged  by  the  Treaty  of  Bangkok,  have  already
ratified this important Treaty.  After  consultations  with
sponsors  and  interested  delegations  on  the  possibility
of amending draft resolution L.34 to reflect these new
developments,  the  Brazilian  delegation  proposes  the

region, and calls upon all concerned States to continue
to work together in order to facilitate adherence to the
protocols  to  nuclear-weapon-free  zone  treaties  by  all
relevant States that have not yet done so”.
On behalf of the sponsors, we recommend to the
General Assembly the approval of this draft resolution,
as amended.
The  President:  I  now  give  the  floor  to  the
representative of Japan.
Mr. Ishikawa (Japan): Subsequent to adoption of
the  draft  resolution  entitled  “A  path  to  the  total
elimination  of  nuclear  weapons”  (A/C.1/57/L.42)  by
the First Committee on 23 October 2002, the Republic
of Cuba acceded to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Japan,
on  behalf  of  the  sponsors  of  that  draft  resolution,
would like to orally propose that the draft resolution be
amended to reflect this new development. Therefore we
recommend  that  in  the  third  preambular  paragraph
amend  “and  welcoming  the  decision”  to  read  as
follows:  “and  welcoming  the  Republic  of  Cuba’s

essential  foundation  for  the  pursuit  of  nuclear

disarmament,  and  welcoming  the  Republic  of
Cuba’s accession to the Treaty”.
The President: I now call upon the representative
of Poland.
Mr.  Lemanski: I  would  like  to  present  an  oral
technical  revision  to  draft  resolution  A/C.1/57/L.48,
entitled  “Implementation  of  the  Convention  on  the
Prohibition

Stockpiling  and  Use  of  Chemical  Weapons  and  on
Their Destruction”.

of 
When  Poland  and  Canada  introduced  this  draft
resolution to the First Committee in October 2002, the
number  of  States  parties  to  the  Convention  was  145.
But,  as  all  members  certainly  know,  since  then  and
before  the  General  Assembly  has  taken  action  on  this
draft  resolution,  two  States  —  Saint  Vincent  and  the
Grenadines  and  Samoa  —  have  acceded 
the
Convention, bringing the total number of States parties
to 147. Poland and Canada would very much like these

to 
“Noting  with  satisfaction  that  since  the
adoption  of  resolution  56/24  K,  four  additional
States have ratified or acceded to the Convention,
bringing the total number of States parties to the
Convention to one hundred and forty-seven,”.

draft resolutions A to CC and the draft decision to the
Assembly  one  by  one.  We  will  take  up  the  oral
amendments  to  draft  resolutions  B,  P,  U  and  Y  when
we come to each of the draft resolutions. After all the
decisions  have  been  taken,  representatives  will  again
have the opportunity to explain their vote.
Draft  resolutions  A  to  CC  are  to  be  found  in
paragraph  90  of  section  III  of  the  report  of  the  First

The  Acting  President:  I  now  call  on

representative of Mongolia in explanation of vote after
the voting.
for 
support 
Mr. Erendo (Mongolia): Resolution 57/67, which
has  just  been  adopted,  vividly  demonstrates  broad
strengthening  Mongolia’s
traditional 
international  security  and 
its  nuclear-weapon-free
status.  In  the  two  years  since  the  Assembly  first
adopted  a  resolution  under  this  topic,  a  number  of
national and international measures have been taken to
further consolidate Mongolia’s external security and its
nuclear-weapon-free  status,  which  is  reflected  in  the
Secretary-General’s report on this item (A/57/159).
That  is  why,  in  the  resolution  just  adopted,  the
General Assembly

cooperate  with  Mongolia 
“Welcomes  the  efforts  made  by  Member
States 
in
implementing  resolution  55/33S,  as  well  as  the
progress  made 
in  consolidating  Mongolia’s
international security” (resolution 57/67, para. 4)
and

and
Mongolia’s

borders,  its  economic  security,  its  ecological
balance and its nuclear-weapon-free status” (ibid,
para. 5).
We believe that the two studies to be undertaken
on Mongolia’s economic and ecological vulnerabilities,
which are mentioned in the Secretary-General’s report,
could  contribute  to  addressing  the  country’s  economic
and  ecological  challenges,  and  thus  to  strengthening
the  basis  of  Mongolia’s  unique  nuclear-weapon-free
status.
As 
resolution  57/67  outlines,  Mongolia’s
strengthened external security and its nuclear-weapon-
free status serves to promote the  aims of nuclear non-
proliferation  and  to  contribute  to  enhancing  stability
and confidence-building in the region.
In  conclusion,  my  delegation  would  like  to  take
this opportunity to thank Member States, the Secretary-
General  and  the  relevant  United  Nations  bodies  for
their  support  and  cooperation.  Bearing  in  mind  the
importance of the credibility of its nuclear-weapon-free
status, Mongolia will do its utmost to institutionalize it
at the international level. We will do so in the hope that
this  innovative  approach  could  prove  to  be  useful  to
others, including those in North-East Asia, so that they
may  creatively  address  their  broader  national  security
concerns  in  tandem  with  the  creation  of  nuclear-
weapon-free zones.

The  Acting  President:

I 
Abstaining:
on 
the
representative  of  Togo,  who  wishes  to  speak  in
explanation of position on the resolutions just adopted.
Mr. Kpotsra  (Togo)  (spoke  in  French):  In  the
First  Committee,  and  earlier  in  plenary  meeting,  the
delegation  of  Togo  joined  the  consensus  on  the  draft
resolutions  on  the  United  Nations  regional  centres  for
peace  and  disarmament.  We  would  like,  however,  to
take  this  opportunity  to  once  again  draw  attention  to
the  financial  difficulties 
the  United  Nations
regional  centres  for  peace  and  disarmament  in  Africa,
Asia  and  the  Pacific  and  Latin  America  and  the
Caribbean  continue  to  face  in  carrying  out  their
operational and administrative activities.
that 
Given that they are funded by available resources
and  the  voluntary  contributions  of  Member  States  and
international  governmental  and  non-governmental
organizations and foundations, the regional centres are
not  always  able  to  mobilize  the  financial  resources
needed  for  their  activities.  In  this  rather  gloomy
context,  we  should  like  to  commend  the  report  on  the
inspection  of 
the  programme  management  and
for
administrative  practices 
Disarmament  Affairs  of 
Internal
Oversight  Services,  contained  in  document  A/56/817.
Paragraph 77, under “Conclusions”, states:
in 
the  Office 
the  Department 
for 
the 
the 
“One  of 
revitalization  of 
important  and  promising
aspects  of  the  Department’s  work  is  its  regional
dimension.  While 
the
regional  centres  is  on  track,  their  continuity  and
longer-term  viability  are  far  from  being  ensured.
Achieving  a  longer-term  sustainability  of  the
the
centres  would 
teamwork  of 
and
financial
persistence

entire  Department 
in  building  up 
require 
the 
their 
A/57/PV.57
resources  and  ensuring  their  continuity.  That,  in
turn, would allow the establishment of core staff
and secure the centres’ institutional memory. The
Office  is  of  the  view  that  such  extra  efforts  are
essential  as  the  strong  regional  centres  would
provide  the  dynamic  hubs  for  the  Department’s
regional presence.”
Under  the  “Recommendations”  of  the  Office  of
the  Secretary-
Internal  Oversight  Services,  which 
General seems to support, paragraph 94 states:
“Given  that  the  viability  of  the  regional
centres  is  constantly  threatened  by  a  shortage  of
voluntary contributions, and that their good work
and usefulness are consistently recognized by the
General  Assembly,  the  Under-Secretary-General
for  Disarmament  Affairs  should  request  that
operational  support  activities  of  the  centres  be
financed,  as  required  in  each  individual  case,
from the regular budget”.
In  other  words,  instead  of  annually  updating
earlier  resolutions  regarding  regional  centres,  we
should  make  greater  efforts  to  fully  fund  all  spending
on  regional  centres  from  the  regular  United  Nations
budget.  In  so  doing,  we  will  truly  demonstrate  our
genuine  support  for  the  objectives  of  the  United
Nations  in  the  area  of  arms  control  and  disarmament,
as well as our appreciation of the active role played to
date by the regional centres.
That  is  the  task  that  the  delegation  of  Togo  will
undertake in the coming months, working closely with
all  those  that  support  the  activities  of  the  United
Nations regional centres for peace and disarmament.
