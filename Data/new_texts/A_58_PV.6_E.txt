follow-up to the outcome of the twenty-sixth
special session and the implementation of the
Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS
Report of the Secretary-General (A/58/184)
The  Acting  President:  I  now  give  the  floor  to
His Excellency The Honourable Joseph Borg, Minister
for Foreign Affairs of Malta.
Mr.  Borg  (Malta):  My  delegation  aligns  itself
with  the  statement  delivered  by  Italy  on  behalf  of  the
European Union and acceding countries.
Although  the  number  of  cases  of  HIV/AIDS  in
Malta  remains  comparatively  low,  we  recognize  the
further potential  devastating impact of  the  disease  and
acknowledge 
there  is  certainly  no  room  for
complacency.  We  reaffirm  Malta’s  pledge  to  fight
against  that  pandemic,  as  well  as  our  commitment  to
strive  further  to  address  the  problem  of  HIV/AIDS  in
that 
is  not 
enough.  Our 
all  its  aspects.  Discussing  the  problem  at  the  national
level 
as
representatives  of  our  citizens  compel  us  to  take  the
debate  further.  We  have  a  collective  moral  obligation
towards  the  citizens  we  represent  to  address  this
challenge  in  a  concrete  manner  and  in  a  concerted
global response.
responsibilities 
That fight has to be fought on two fronts, namely,
those  of  containment  and  prevention.  Admittedly,  that
is not easy; but the experiences  of other  countries  that
have been successful should serve as an example for all
to follow. Malta has closely witnessed the changes and
advances  that  have  occurred  in  the  field  over  past
years — from  the  unfortunate  earlier  times,  when  all
that could be offered to our patients  was the  treatment
of  opportunistic  infections  and  palliative  care,  to  the
more  recent  availability  of  antiretroviral  medication.
That has completely changed the outlook and quality of
life of our patients and of all concerned.
Malta  believes 
that  an  accessible  and  well-
organized health care system is the key to an effective
containment  strategy.  Our  State  hospital’s  infectious
diseases  unit  offers  centralized  service  on  the  island.
Free  antiretroviral  treatment  may  only  be  prescribed
from  that  unit,  which  also  works  very  closely  with  a
centralized laboratory where anonymous HIV-testing is
carried out. That allows for more accurate collection of
data  and  epidemiological  study,  which  is  central  to  a
targeted response and appropriate allocation  of limited
resources.

Malta’s  response  to  the  epidemic  has  been  a
comprehensive  one,  integrating  prevention,  voluntary
confidential  counselling  and  testing,  care,  support  and
treatment. That multidisciplinary service is provided by
various  departments  of  the  national  health  service,
working  in  close  liaison  with  social  workers  and
related non-governmental organizations.
Indeed,  the  prevention  of  infection  remains  the
mainstay of Malta’s response, through the provision of
information,  the  screening  of  all  blood  donors  and
donations, the adoption of universal precautions in the
health  care  setting,  awareness-raising  campaigns  and
targeted educational and other programmes, such as the
free  distribution  of  syringes  from  health  centres.  In
addition, people living with HIV/AIDS in Malta benefit
from  easy  access 
including
medication, information, counselling and support — all
of  which  has  resulted  in  improved  quality  of  life.
Confidentiality is a priority throughout the system, and
is of the utmost importance in a small community like

infections.  HIV  testing  is  actively  encouraged  in  all
patients attending the recently set up walk-in clinic for
the  diagnosis  and  management  of  sexually  transmitted
infections.  The  very  good  uptake  of  70  per  cent  is
much higher than the minimum recommended target.
Malta  is  actively  working  on  its  first  national
sexual  health  policy.  Key  elements  of  the  policy
include  proposals  for  a  review  of  sex  education  in
schools and  surveillance  of major  sexually transmitted
infections,  including  HIV.  It  will  also  emphasize  the
need  for  specific  legislation  to  address  problems  such
as  discrimination  in  employment  opportunities  and
other basic human rights.
Although  the  problem  of  HIV/AIDS  is  relatively
contained  on  our  island,  it  is  still  a  reality  and  larger
than  life  for  those  who  live  with  the  virus  day  in  and
day out.
In  conclusion  I  would  like  to  reiterate  an  all-
important  point  that  our  countries  had  made  in  the
Declaration  of  Commitment  expressed  at  the  twenty-
sixth  special  session  of  the  General  Assembly,  when
we  affirmed  the  key  role  played  by  the  family  in  the
prevention,  care,  support  and  treatment  of  our  fellow
human beings affected by this human tragedy.

The  Acting  President:  I  now  give  the  floor  to
Her  Excellency  Mrs.  Geneviève  Sindabizera,  Minister
in Charge of the Fight against AIDS of the Republic of
Burundi.
Mrs.  Sindabizera  (Burundi)  (spoke  in  French):
The  HIV/AIDS  pandemic,  which  emerged  at  the  start
of the 1980s, has now become not only a public health
problem  but  also  a  major  challenge  to  all  sustainable
human  development.  This  scourge  has  seriously
jeopardized  the  achievements  of  humanity  in  terms  of
social  and  economic  development.  This  situation  is  of
particular concern in countries  with fragile economies,
particularly African countries.
Within  the  past  20  years,  specialized  institutions
are  reporting  alarming  figures  on  infected  persons.  It
should be  stressed  that  the majority of  people affected
are found in sub-Saharan Africa. The world must show
more  solidarity,  for  Africa  is  truly  in  the  process  of
decline.
To  confront  this  unprecedented  global  crisis,  the
General  Assembly  outlined  in  2001  a  global  plan  of
action  to  fight  HIV/AIDS,  together  with  a  Declaration
of  Commitment  to  promote  the  involvement  at  the
highest level in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Two years
after that Declaration, the time has come for reviewing
the outcome.
Concerning  my country, Burundi, in  particular, it
should  first  be  stressed  that  the  rate  of  HIV  infection
has  reached  a  very  alarming  level.  Thus,  according  to
the last national survey of seroprevalence, in December
2002,  the infection rate  was,  respectively, 9.4 per  cent
in urban areas, 10.5 per cent in suburban areas and 2.5
per cent in rural areas.

impoverishment, 
the  weakness  of  actions  against
HIV/AIDS  and  low  level  of  training  and  information
have  contributed  to  this  rapid  spread  of  the  epidemic.
Confronted  with  the  magnitude  of  this  pandemic,  the
Government  of  Burundi  has  drafted  a  national  plan  of
action to combat AIDS covering the period 2002-2006.
The plan is now at its implementation phase.

institutional
framework.  It  is  to  this  end  that  it  set  up  a  National
Council,  sectoral  departments,  provincial  committees,
communal committees and local committees to combat
AIDS. This approach was adopted to involve all sectors
of the population, from top to bottom.
To  show  the  commitment  at  the  highest  level  of
Government  to  that  fight,  which  we  cannot  afford  to
lose, the National Council to combat AIDS is presided
over by the head of State himself.  At the same time, a
ministry attached to the  presidency responsible  for  the
fight against AIDS was created.
Today,  thanks  to  the  Government’s  tenacity  and
support  from  our  partners,  virtually  all  of 
these
structures are operational. The determined involvement
of civil society associations,  national  and international
non-governmental  organizations,  religious  groups  and
organizations  of  persons  living  with  HIV/AIDS  in  the
fight against this scourge should also be mentioned.
Of  course,  the  optimal  implementation  of  our
plan  of  action  requires  financial  resources,  part  of
which remains to be acquired, namely $140 million out
of an estimated budget of $230 million.
I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank
those  who  have  already  come  through  with  their
pledges.  I  would  especially  like  to  mention  the  World
Bank, 
the  Joint  United  Nations  Programme  on
HIV/AIDS  (UNAIDS),  and  the  Global  Fund  to  Fight
HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis. I would also like
to  urge  those  who  have  not  made  their  contribution  to
do so promptly, for tomorrow risks being too late.
It  is  very  regrettable  today  that  in  most  poor
countries  like  Burundi  we  are  not  able  to  prevent
mother-to-child  transmission  of  the  virus,  whereas
appropriate  and  effective  treatment  exists.  It  is  also
frustrating to see that medicine to reduce the viral load
exists,  but  because  of 
income  of  our
populations,  we  are  deprived  of  progress  made  by
medicine.
low 
the 
The  problem  of  care  for  the  sick  is  a  major
hindrance  to  voluntary  testing.  To  get  beyond  this
deadlock  and  safeguard  humanity,  it  is  high  time  to
concert  our  efforts  more  specifically  to  stem  this
scourge and to be able to pass on to our youth a world
full of hope.
Let  us  rest  assured:  the  success  of  this  noble
mission  will  depend  on  active  solidarity  between
nations, which should be our banner in the fight.

The  Acting  President:  I  now  give  the  floor  to
His  Excellency  Mr.  Michael  Vit,  Deputy  Minister  of
Health of the Czech Republic.
Mr.  Vit  (Czech  Republic):  The  Czech  Republic
fully  associates  itself  with  the  statement  delivered
earlier  by  Italy  on  behalf  of  the  European  Union.  Let
me, however, add a few words on the specific situation
of my country, the Czech Republic.
I  must  admit  that  the  Czech  Republic  is  still  a
very  fortunate  country  as  far  as 
the  HIV/AIDS
epidemic  is  concerned.  As  of  31  July  2003,  only  633
cases of HIV infection have been diagnosed among the
10.3 million of our citizens, reaching a cumulative HIV
prevalence  of  61.6  cases  per  million  inhabitants.  To
date,  exactly  100  patients  have  died,  out  of  the  168
AIDS cases in our country. For many different reasons,
the  Czech  Republic  belongs  to  the  countries  least
affected by this epidemic scourge in both the European
and the global perspective.
Our  country  greatly  appreciated 
the  whole
process  in  the  United  Nations  leading  to  the  adoption
of  the  Declaration  of  Commitment  during  the  United
Nations  special  session  of  the  General  Assembly  in
June  2001.  The  Czech  Republic  fully  supported  the
Joint  United  Nations  Programme  on  HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS)  effort  to  achieve  effective  leadership  and
coordination  of  the  worldwide  actions 
to  combat
HIV/AIDS,  agreed 
the  prevention  of
HIV/AIDS,  mobilization  of  the  necessary  level  of
financial  resources  and  other  important  goals.  Having
the  targets  set  by  the  Declaration  of  Commitment,  we
have to fully concentrate on fulfilling these targets and
on  monitoring  the  progress  in  achieving  them  in  the
periods set by the Declaration itself.
targets  for 
Please  allow  me  to  quote  some  data  from  nine
national  indicators  monitoring  the  progress  of  the
national  AIDS  programme  and  HIV-related  behaviour.
First,  our  data  suggest  that  teachers  in  93  per  cent  of
the  grammar  schools  have  been  trained  in  life-skills-
based education and have taught the subject during the
past  school  year.  We  consider  that  all  young  people
have the right to get the correct information about how
to  protect  themselves  and  how  to  adopt  skills  to  limit
their risky behaviour.
Secondly,  nearly  100  per  cent  of  the  clients  in
regional  sexually  transmitted  disease  (STD)  facilities
are  afforded  appropriate  counselling,  diagnosis  and
treatment  for  STDs,  including  HIV  counselling.  These
3
A/58/PV.6
facilities  offer  HIV  testing  on  a  voluntary  basis  to  all
patients with STDs.
Thirdly,  this  year  we  are  in  the  process  of
collecting  updated  information  on  behaviour  among
young  adults  from  15 
to  24  years  of  age  and
intravenous  drug  users,  and  we  will  analyse  and
interpret that data by the end of this year.
With  regard  to  the  overall  impact  of  HIV,  since
1985  we  have  diagnosed  only  three  cases  of  vertical

The  Acting  President:  I  give  the  floor  to  His
Excellency Mr. Gao Qiang, Deputy Minister of  Health
of the People’s Republic of China.
Mr. Qiang (China) (spoke in Chinese): Entrusted
by  His  Excellency  Mr.  Hu  Jintao,  President  of  the
People’s Republic of China, I now have the pleasure to
attend  this  high-level  meeting  on  HIV/AIDS  and  to
make a statement.

HIV/AIDS  is  a  common  enemy  of  the  whole  of
mankind. It is our common task to control and prevent
HIV/AIDS.  The  special  session  of 
the  General
Assembly  on  HIV/AIDS,  which  was  held  two  years
ago,  played  an  important  role  in  attracting  global
attention  to  the  issue  of  HIV/AIDS  and  to  improving
measures aimed at its prevention and control.
The convening of this high-level plenary meeting
once  again  demonstrates  the  importance  the  United
Nations  has  attached  to  HIV/AIDS.  The  Chinese
Government greatly appreciates the efforts made by the
United  Nations  and  is  working  actively  in  the  global

great
importance  to  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  treatment.
The Chinese President Hu Jintao once stated explicitly,
“HIV/AIDS  prevention,  care  and  treatment  is  a  major
issue  pertinent  to  the  quality  and  prosperity  of  the
Chinese  nation.  ...  We  need  to  motivate  the  whole
society to deal with it.” Mr. Wen Jiabao, Premier of the
State  Council,  has  also  given  instructions  to  address
HIV/AIDS issues
Based  on  the  experience  and  lessons  learned  in
the past ten years, we have established the principle of
HIV/AIDS  prevention,  care  and  treatment  —  focusing
on  prevention  —  and  have  formulated  medium  and
long-term strategic plans.
The Chinese Government has allocated 6.8 billion
yuan  to  establish  and  improve  disease  prevention  and
control  mechanisms  in  the  provinces.  It  has  invested
2.25 billion yuan to strengthen the blood stations. Each
year  more than 200  million yuan are used  as  a  special
fund for HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment.
Chinese care projects have been established in 51
counties 
in  China  and  encompass  extensive  and
comprehensive  prevention  and  treatment  measures.
However, we are fully aware of the fact that China is a
developing  country  and 
its  economic  and  social
development  is  still  at  an  early  stage.  Consequently,
sufficient  attention  has  not  been  devoted  to  AIDS-
related issues.  This  year,  we  have  cooperated  with  the
World  Health  Organization  and 
the  Joint  United
Nations  Programme  on  HIV/AIDS  (UNAIDS) 
in
conducting  a  joint  HIV/AIDS  epidemiological  survey.
In  China  we  have  about  840,000  HIV/AIDS  infected
individuals including about 80,000 patients with AIDS.
Faced  with

Government  considers  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and

we will punish those accountable.

Secondly,  the  Chinese  Government  is  committed
to providing free treatment and medicine to HIV/AIDS
patients.  We  will  strengthen  our  development  of
research  and  study  of  HIV/AIDS  drugs.  We  will  also
increase  the  construction  of  hospitals  to  treat  people
with HIV/AIDS.
Thirdly,  public  awareness  campaigns  will  be
launched,  educating  the  public  and  encouraging  them
to  participate  in  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  treatment
efforts. We will crack down on illegal acts such as drug
trafficking,  drug  use,  prostitution  and  illegal  blood
collection and supply.
Fourthly,  we  will  protect  the  legitimate  rights  of
HIV/AIDS  patients.  In  all  of  the  124  counties  where
the  Chinese  care  projects  will  be  established,  the
Government  will  provide  economic  aid  to  HIV/AIDS
patients  who  are  living  in  poverty,  and  their  children
will have free tuition to attend school.
Fifthly,  we  will  be  more  active  in  international
cooperation.  We  have  pledged  $10  million  to  the
Global  Fund to  Fight  AIDS,  Tuberculosis  and  Malaria
to  support  the  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  treatment
efforts  of  developing  countries,  fulfil  the  development
goals  of  the  United  Nations  Millennium  Declaration
and  contribute  to  the  early  control  of  the  spread  of
HIV/AIDS.
The Acting President:  I  call  on  Her  Excellency
Ms.  Lidija  Topic,  Deputy  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs
of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Ms.  Topic  (Bosnia  and  Herzegovina):  Let  me
congratulate  the  United  Nations  for  convening  this
important  meeting  at  a  time  which  is  far  too  late  for
millions of victims — children, women and men — but
still in due time to join the  effort  in  the  fight to prove
that the spread of AIDS is no longer inevitable. Let me
also  thank  the  United  Nations  Secretary-General  for
this timely initiative.
A/58/PV.6
Bosnia  and  Herzegovina  belongs  to  the  group  of
countries with a low-level epidemic, meaning that HIV
prevalence  does  not  exceed  5  per  cent  within  any
defined sub-population. But, epidemiologists in Bosnia
and  Herzegovina  agree  that  this  is  only  the  tip  of  the
iceberg,  and  that  the  number  of  those  living  with
HIV/AIDS in Bosnia and Herzegovina is much larger.
In  addition,  our  analysis  of  the  current  situation,
weaknesses  in  the  early-detection  system  and  our
monitoring  of  HIV/AIDS  have  led  us  to  the  following
conclusions:  there  are  some  weaknesses  even  in  first-
generation  monitoring;  second-generation  monitoring
has not yet been introduced; with regard to testing, the
goal of anonymity has not been met and testing has not
been  free  of  cost;  and  finally,  there  has  been  no
adequate qualitative response on the  part  of  the  health
sector  to  diagnostics  and  treatment  with  highly  active
antiretroviral therapy.
We  in  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina  have  therefore
undertaken  energetic  action  to  fight  the  spread  of
HIV/AIDS, which we are obliged to do as a Member of
this  body.  In  accordance  with  the  Declaration  of
Commitment  on  HIV/AIDS 
(resolution  S-26/2,
annex) — which Bosnia and Herzegovina has adopted,
thereby  fully  accepting  the  relevant  obligations —
Bosnia  and  Herzegovina’s  Council  of  Ministers  has
established  a  National  Advisory  Board  for  fighting
HIV/AIDS. The Board’s mission of fighting HIV/AIDS
is 
implementing  an
adequate  response  to  the  spreading  of  the  HIV/AIDS
epidemic throughout the world and its expected further
spread throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Board
will carry out its mission by developing a national anti-
HIV/AIDS  policy  and  strategy.  In  order  to  respond
adequately  to  the  increasing  interest  of  youth  in
HIV/AIDS issues, the National Advisory Board, taking
their  special 
into  account,  has  defined
priorities for protecting the interests of the groups most
vulnerable to HIV/AIDS exposure.

Taking  a  multisectoral  approach  in  the  fight
against  HIV/AIDS,  the  National  Advisory  Board  has
established  principles  of  HIV/AIDS  prevention  based
on:  permanent  cooperation  among  governmental
institutions  at  all  levels;  transparency  in  HIV/AIDS
work  at  all  levels;  the  establishment  of  an  appropriate

participation on the part of all actors — including those
who  are  HIV-positive,  with  or  without  symptoms,  and
those who live or work with them — in implementation
of  the  HIV/AIDS  prevention  strategy;  and  programme

of international assistance.
Based  on  those  principles,  the  Advisory  Board
has  prepared  a  prevention  strategy  that  has  been
discussed  extensively  in  the  country.  The  document’s
special  value  lies  in  its  definition  of  strategic  goals:
preventing  the  transmission  and  spread  of  HIV/AIDS;
ensuring  adequate  medical treatment,  care and  support
for  persons  living  with  HIV/AIDS;  creating  a  legal
framework  for  protecting  ethnic  principles  and  the
human  rights  of  persons 
living  with  HIV/AIDS;

the  steps  actively  taken  by  the  Governments  of  the
United  States  and  of  the  European  Union  countries  in
order  to  support  the  Fund.  Additionally,  Bosnia  and
Herzegovina  very  much  supports  the  initiative  for

Thailand.
the  Kingdom  of
Mr.  Kasemsuvan  (Thailand):  I  share  the  view
expressed  this  morning  by  the  Secretary-General  and
many  other  speakers  who  preceded  me  that,  although
we  have  achieved  significant  progress  in  our  fight
against HIV/AIDS, it is simply not enough.
Since  the  outbreak  of  the  AIDS  epidemic  in
Thailand,  no  less  than  1  million  people  have  been
infected,  nearly  400,000  have  died  and  approximately
600,000  are  currently  living  with  HIV/AIDS.  To  meet
this  devastating  challenge,  strong  leadership  and  firm
political  commitment  are  of  the  utmost  importance.
Political  leaders  in  Thailand  have  successively  placed
HIV/AIDS  prevention  high  on  their  national  agendas
and  have  committed  much-needed  resources  to  the
national  AIDS  programme.  Between  1984  and  2002,
the  Thai  Government  progressively

annual  national  budget  for  HIV/AIDS  programmes

increased 
To fight the pandemic, multisectoral participation
has  been  at  the  core  of 
the  Thai  Government’s
approach. Civil society — especially non-governmental
organizations — have taken a very active part in policy
development  and  implementation  through  the  national
AIDS prevention and control committee, chaired by the
Prime Minister. In addition, a substantive portion of the
annual budget has been allocated to support HIV/AIDS
prevention  and  treatment  projects  carried  out  by  non-
governmental organizations.
The  work  of  civil  society 
in  Thailand  has
expanded  our  HIV/AIDS  programme  to  reach  target
groups  in  areas  where  the  Government  has  constraints
or  limitations.  Moreover,  to  adopt  a  holistic  approach,
the  Government  has

HIV  infection  has  resulted  in  a  great  decline  in  the
annual  HIV  infection  rate  from  140,000  cases  to
approximately  20,000.  The  Thai  Government

Despite  our  success,  however,  Thailand  cannot
afford 
to  be  complacent.  We  must  continue  our
awareness-raising  and  prevention  campaigns  with  a
particular  focus  on  new  potentially  vulnerable  groups
such  as  youth.  At  the  same  time,  we  must  continue  to
place  emphasis  on  addressing  the  need  for  treatment
and  care  of  the  600,000  people  currently  living  with
HIV/AIDS.
Thailand  considers  HIV/AIDS  to  be  a  threat  to
human  security  from  the perspectives  of  both  freedom
from  fear  and  freedom  from  want.  The  psychological
impacts of HIV/AIDS can create a climate of fear that
can be more harmful than the disease itself. Thailand’s
newly established Ministry of Social Development and
Human Security is charged with playing a leading role,

the implementation of  the  Declaration of  Commitment
on  HIV/AIDS  (resolution  S-26/2,  annex).  But  their
pledge would be of no avail were it not for the pledge

The  Acting  President:  I  now  give  the  floor  to
His  Excellency  Mr.  Ichiro  Fujisaki,  Deputy  Minister
for Foreign Affairs of Japan.
Mr. Fujisaki (Japan): We are at war. There is no
cracking  sound  of  bombs  and  bullets.  Nonetheless,
millions of people are suffering every day. Millions of
people  are  dying  every  year.  That  is  the  war  between
humankind and HIV/AIDS. It is a real war.
Mankind  has  fought  against  many  diseases.  We
are  winning  on  some  of  the  fronts.  However,  we  are
now  facing  one  of  our  toughest  enemies,  namely
HIV/AIDS.  We  know  that  if  we  spare  any  effort,  our
opponent will gain ground. We will not let that happen.
That  was  the  political  commitment  made  two  years
ago. We are here to renew our political will. And that is
exactly what I think all countries are going to do today.
As  this  is  not  the  first  war  against  disease  that
mankind has fought, we know what the strategy should
be. Let me spell out four points. First is the importance
of  prevention.  Prevention  is  the  most  effective  way  of
containing diseases. The key here is knowledge. People
can  avoid  diseases  only  if  they  know  what  to  guard
against.  We  have 
and
dissemination of information.

The  second  is  increased  access  to  treatment  and
care. The recent  World Trade  Organization  Agreement
on  Trade-Related  Aspects  of  Intellectual  Property
Rights  (TRIPS)  is  to  be  welcomed.  Now  it  is  all  the
more  important  to  make  the  best  use  of  it.  And,  for
that,  we  have  to  enhance  health  systems,  including
enhancement  of  health  personnel,  evaluation  and
monitoring  capabilities.  We  must  also  make  support  a
priority. We have to have a comprehensive strategy.

including 
Thirdly,  we  must  mobilize all our forces at  once.
All  stakeholders, 
the  Governments  of
developing  countries  and  donor  countries,  non-
governmental organizations and the private sector, have
to work as partners. Ownership and partnership have to
play a major role here.
Fourthly,  we  need  better  coordination  among  us.
For  example,  each  international  organization  is  not  an
individual  division.  Each  is  a  regiment  of  our  entire
forces.  Bilateral  assistance  should be  coordinated  with
multilateral  assistance.  From 
that  standpoint,  we
welcome the establishment of the Global Fund. It gives
us a strong hope.
I  would  like  now  to  touch  on  Japanese  policy.
Japan reportedly has fewer than 10,000 people who are
HIV  positive  in  a  country  with  a  population  of  120
million people. That may be a small number compared
to  other  countries.  However,  we  take  this  issue  very
seriously.  Why?  We  do  so  for  two  reasons.  First,  it
involves  human  life.  Secondly,  we  have  a  recent
memory of fighting epidemics in our country. We know
that  without  containing  diseases,  there  can  be  no
development.
That is why the Government of Japan announced
the  Okinawa  Infectious  Diseases  Initiative  three  years
ago. We have announced $3 billion in five years as our
target.  We  have  already  disbursed  $2  billion.  In  doing
so, we have tried to strike the right balance in different
regions  and  among  different  measures,  namely
prevention, 
top
bilateral assistance, we have tried our best, with others,
to  establish  the  Global  Fund.  We  have  pledged  that  in
the initial three years, we will contribute $200 million.
We are faithfully implementing our commitment. Japan
will  continue  to  support  a  wide  range  of  measures  to
fight  infectious  diseases  through  a  combination  of
bilateral and multilateral programmes.
treatment,  care  and  support.  On 
In  concluding,  let  me  thank  the  United  Nations
for  taking  this  valuable  and  opportune  initiative.  We
think  that  this  is  very  timely,  because  we  are  now
entering  a  critical  phase  in  our  war.  We  have  to  fight
together, and we will win.
The  Acting  President:  I  now  give  the  floor  to
His Excellency Mr. Abelardo Moreno, Deputy Minister
for Foreign Affairs of Cuba.
Mr.  Moreno  (Cuba)  (spoke  in  Spanish):  The
special  session  of  the  General  Assembly  devoted  to
8
combating  HIV/AIDS,  held 
in  June  2001,  gave
significant political impetus to confront this pandemic.
Nevertheless, a vast gap between the rich and the poor
and  between  North  and  South  still  prevails  in  our
world.  We  live  in  a  world  where  one  fifth  of  the
children born in the poorest countries do not live to the
age of five, where 50 per cent of all children under five
suffer  from  malnutrition  and  where  70  per  cent  of
people  between  15  and  24  are  illiterate.  More  than  a
billion  people  lack  low-cost  essential  drugs,  and  more
than  a  billion  still  cannot  meet  their  basic  needs  for
food, sanitation, health care, housing and education.
The  HIV/AIDS  pandemic  is  part  of  that  harsh
reality.  The  disease  is  spreading  increasingly,  with
greater force, among the poorest and most marginalized
population with no access to education and health care.
It  is  more  concentrated  in  those  countries  that  are
victims  of  the  unjust  and  unsustainable  international
economic order, particularly in the high-risk groups of
the  urban  population  who  endure  poverty  and
marginalization.  AIDS

More  than  two  thirds  of  the  people  in  the  world
suffering from HIV/AIDS live in  Africa. The  situation
of that continent is truly tragic. Only a minute fraction
of the tens of millions of infected Africans receive the
antiretroviral  treatment they require.  Millions  more  do
not  have  access  to  medicine  for  the  treatment  of
opportunistic infections either.
Cuba  has  succeeded  in  containing  the  pandemic
despite  the  fierce  economic,  commercial  and  financial
blockade  imposed  by  the  Government  of  the  United
States,  which  hinders  our  access  to  50  per  cent  of  the
new  drugs  produced  in  the  world,  since  they  are
produced  by  United  States  companies  or 
their
subsidiaries,  which,  under  the  blockade  laws,  cannot
have economic and trade relations with my country.
So  far,  the  epidemic  in  Cuba  has  been  classified
as  low-level,  and  the  prevalence  in  Cuba  of  infected
people  aged  from  15  to  49  years  old  is  0.05  per  cent:
the lowest rate in the Americas and one of the lowest in

importance  that  the  international  community  attaches
to  combating  and  containing  that  deadly  scourge.
Today we are sharing our expertise, our experience and
the  lessons  we  have  learned  in  order  to  redress  the
shortcomings and obstacles and, as a result, to be better
prepared  to  deal  with  this  disease,  which  threatens  all
aspects of human life and society.
The  Government  of  the  Syrian  Arab  Republic
early on became aware of the magnitude of this disease
and  considers  it  a  source  of  great  concern.  Thus,  we
established in 1987 a national programme to deal  with
AIDS.  In  that  regard,  Syria  has  established  a  cross-
sectoral  national  strategic  plan,  which  has  led  to  the
establishment  of  a  national  committee  on  AIDS.  The
committee  is  making  every  effort  in  all  areas  covered
by  the  Declaration  of  Commitment  on  HIV/AIDS.  I
would like to highlight some of the measures Syria has
taken to deal with this epidemic.

Fifth, we provide all necessary medicines to treat

Sixth, we are fighting the causes of the disease by

Thanks  to  the  efforts  of  health-care  agencies  in
Syria  and the  role  played  by  community  organizations
and  social  and  religious  institutions,  the  incidence  of
HIV/AIDS  in  Syria  is  low.  Despite  this,  there  are  key
obstacles  that  impede  national  efforts  to  achieve  the
results  set  forth  in  the  Declaration  of  Commitment.

The  Declaration  of  Commitment  on  HIV/AIDS,
adopted  on  27  June  2001  at  the  special  session  on

with the social aspects of HIV/AIDS prevention. Social
counsellors  in  the  Ministry  of  Education  have  been
trained on how to deal with the disease and on the role
of counselling in preventing it. The Ministry of Health
has  established  an  educational  programme  for  the

deserves support so that we can use every means at our

In  conclusion,  we  hope  that  these  meetings  will

someday be contained and eliminated.
The  Acting  President: I  give  the  floor  to  His
Excellency  Mr.  Mauricio  Solórzano,  Chairman  of  the
delegation of the Republic of Nicaragua.
Mr. Solórzano (Nicaragua) (spoke in Spanish): I

express our gratitude for the holding of these important

reported  seropositive  cases,  comprising  101  HIV
infections, 61 AIDS cases and 32 deaths.
Compared  with  2001  and  2002,  an  accelerated
advance of the virus has been observed in our country.
That  underscores  the  fact  that,  at  the  end  of  2001,  the
incidence  of  the  virus  was  no  longer  limited  to  the
Pacific  zone  of  Nicaragua  but  had  spread  to  the
Atlantic  coast  regions,  specifically  the  autonomous
northern and southern regions. It is important to  stress
that the most affected age group is 20 to 34, comprising
the  most  economically  and  sexually  active  population.
On  the  other  hand,  the  affected  group  aged  0  to  4  is
also growing because of the increase in mother-to-child

rate  of  3.63  per  100,000  inhabitants,  with  the  highest
incidence  among  young  people.  That  leads  us  to
believe that in our country, the epidemic, once nascent,
is  becoming  concentrated  and  generalized  in  some
cases.

The  Acting  President: I  give  the  floor  to  His
Excellency  Mr.  Lemuel  Stanilaus,  Chairman  of  the
delegation of Grenada.
Mr. Stanilaus (Grenada): Because the night is far
spent,  and  because  much  has  been  written  and  spoken
about the HIV/AIDS pandemic with which the Grenada
delegation readily concurs — especially the substantive
and eloquent statement  made  by  Prime  Minister  Owen
Arthur  of  Barbados  —  my  delegation  will  limit  its
short contribution mainly to prevention, the first line of
defence against HIV/AIDS.
The age-old adage that an ounce of prevention is
worth  a  pound  of  cure  is  the  underpinning  of  good
physical  and  mental  health.  Following  that  sensible
advice  reduces  the  pain  and  suffering  and  time  and
financial  loss  caused  by  illness  generally.  Add  to  this
the case of HIV/AIDS — the stigma, the rejection, the
A/58/PV.6
conspiracy  of  silence  based  on  ignorance,  the  high
mortality  —  and  you  have  the  makings  of  a  human
tragedy of immeasurable proportions.

General  Assembly  resolution  S-26/2  of  27  June
entitled  Declaration  of  Commitment  on
2001, 
HIV/AIDS,  one  of  whose 
is  entitled
“Prevention  must  be  the  mainstay  of  our  response”,  is
the  focus  of  my  delegation’s  statement  on  this  global
scourge.  My  delegation  compliments  the  Joint  United
Nations  Programme  on  HIV/AIDS  (UNAIDS)  office
here on its embrace of “The ABC  of  AIDS prevention
and  care”.  A  stands  for  abstinence,  B  stands  for  be
faithful  and  C  stands  for  condomize.  The  alarming
global statistics with respect to morbidity and mortality
among  people  who  are  sexually  active  demand  that
every  attempt  be  made  to  change  behavioural  habits
through  education,  by  stressing  the  ABC  of  AIDS
prevention  and  care,  with  emphasis  on  abstinence  and
fidelity.
Today, when young people are bombarded by the
ideology  of  free  sex,  which  is  as  commonplace  as  a
handshake, who will deny that the first line of defence
against  HIV/AIDS  is  abstinence,  which,  additionally,
must be held up to teenagers as a virtue and as worthy
of  emulation?  However,  because  stressing  abstinence
and  education  gives  the  appearance  of  promoting
morality and moral rectitude,  we tend to de-emphasize
the  safest, the  surest  and  the  most  foolproof  guarantee
of HIV/AIDS prevention.

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
today, tomorrow and in the future. We should therefore
accentuate 
the
education  of  our  children.  In  that  connection,  the
international community can take a page  from  Uganda
and Senegal, whose success stories have turned the tide
in the affairs of young people.

Mrs.  Anna  Marzec-Boguslawska,  Director  of 
the
National  AIDS  Centre  of  Poland  and  Chairperson  of
the delegation of Poland.
Mrs.  Marzec-Boguslawska  (Poland):  The  HIV
epidemic appeared in Poland in the 1980s. Despite the
stable  epidemiological  situation  with  respect  to  HIV
13
A/58/PV.6
infections  observed  in  Poland  over  the  past  years,
about  8,200  HIV  infections  have  been  detected  in  our
country  since  1985,  among  a  population  of  almost  39
million.  However,  there  are  an  estimated  15,000  to
20,000  people  living  with  HIV/AIDS  in  Poland.  It  is
worth  mentioning 
in  recent  years  we  have
observed  a  changing  profile  of  the  epidemic,  with  an

In spite of the well-known difficulties all over the
world,  we  are  making  every  effort  to  maintain  the
effectiveness  and  variety  of  our  preventive  activities.
Training,  publications,  education  activities  and  large-
scale multimedia campaigns explaining the complexity
of the issue of HIV/AIDS to different  target  groups of
people  are  organized  very  frequently.  Continuing
education for medical professionals, social workers and
therapists in the field of HIV/AIDS is  provided  within
the framework of a national strategy. The main goal of
our  approach  is  the  gradual  development  of  a  stable
national policy on the management of HIV- and AIDS-
related issues.
the  Government  and 
Since  1996,  prevention,  treatment  and  support
have  been  carried  out  in  Poland  on  the  basis  of  our
national  programme  of  prevention  of  HIV  infections
and care offered to people living  with  HIV  and  AIDS,
which  was  adopted  by 
the
Parliament.  The  programme  is  a  strategic  document
that  determines  the  State’s  multisectoral  policy  on
HIV/AIDS. It is mainly aimed at limiting the spread of
HIV  infection  in  Poland  as  well  as  at  improving  the
quality of and access to care for people living with HIV
and  AIDS. It  must  be pointed  out that  gender  equality
constitutes  a

programme.  Among  other  issues,  particular  attention
has  been  paid  in  the  programme  to  educating  society

is 
A  very  unique  and  valuable  feature  of  our
national  programme  is  its  multilevel  structure.  The
main objective of setting up regional coordinators  was
to ensure the decentralization of HIV/AIDS-prevention
activities  and  the  mainstreaming  of  HIV/AIDS-related
issues,  including  effective  cooperation  between  local
14
governments  and  non-governmental  organizations  on
the local authorities’ agendas.
Preventing transmission of HIV and reducing the
impact  of  HIV/AIDS  in  Poland  fully  ensures  the
protection  and  promotion  of  human  rights.  Since  the
beginning  of  the  1990s,  our  country  has  significantly
contributed to the human rights-based approach to HIV
and  AIDS  at  the  international  level  by  submitting  a
draft  resolution  every  two  years  on  the  protection  of
human  rights  in  the  context  of  HIV  and  AIDS  at  the
sessions of the Commission on Human Rights.
People living with HIV/AIDS in Poland have had
access to specialized treatment since 1996. All patients
who  meet  the  relevant  clinical  criteria  receive  free
antiretroviral  treatment.  The  Minister  of  Health  has
earmarked  $15  million  for  antiretroviral  therapy  for
2003.
free  highly  active  antiretroviral 
Model  testing  centres  have  been  operating  in
Poland  since  1997,  offering  anonymous,  free  tests  as
well  as  pre-  and  post-test  counselling.  In  order  to
prevent social and health damage linked to intravenous
drug  use,  the  exchange  of  needles  and  syringes  has
been practised in Poland since 1991. Methadone-based
substitution therapy started in 1997.  About 700 people
are in the programme, and those  who  meet the  criteria
receive 
therapy.
Incarcerated  persons  also  have  the  same  access  to  the
antiretroviral  treatment.  In  order  to  reduce  mother-to-
child  transmission,  all  pregnant  women  with  known
seropositivity receive antiretroviral prophylactics. As a
result  of  this,  the  rate  of  vertical  transmission  since
1989 has decreased by as much as a factor of 40. That
extraordinary  effect  has  been  achieved  thanks  to  the
firm  HIV/AIDS  policy  of  the  Government  as  well  as
the  genuine  determination  and  dedication  of  medical
staff.
The  role  of  non-governmental  organizations  and
local  authorities  in  the  process  of  tackling  HIV/AIDS
has  never  been  underestimated  in  Poland.  From  the
very beginning of the epidemic, the Polish Government
focused  on  the  promotion  and  funding  of  cross-
disciplinary  initiatives among  all related  governmental
agencies,  non-governmental  organizations  and  other
civil society partners.
Let  me  take  this  opportunity  to  stress  that  the
implementation  of  the  Declaration  of  Commitment,
despite all the difficulties and obstacles  we are  facing,
has  led  to  significant  progress  in  the  prevention  and
eradication of HIV/AIDS.
Poland declares that it stands ready to share all its
experience  with  other  members  of  the  international
community  and  will  be  most  grateful  to  learn  from
them  in  order  to  multiply  our  efforts  in  fighting
HIV/AIDS on a global scale.

His  Excellency  Mr.  Clifford  Sibusiso  Mamba,
Chairman  of 
the  Kingdom  of

Mr.  Mamba  (Swaziland):  The  Kingdom  of
Swaziland remains committed to the implementation of
the  targets  set  by  the  Declaration  of  Commitment  on
HIV/AIDS  adopted  at  the  General  Assembly  special
session  on  27  June  2001.  We  remain  committed  to

five most heavily affected in the world.
the 
Regrettably, Swaziland has not been able to meet
all  the  goals  set  out  for  2003  in  the  Declaration  of
Commitment.  To  a  large  extent,  that  has  been  due  to
insufficient  financial  resources.  The  major  challenges
faced  by  the  kingdom  due  to  the  HIV/AIDS  situation
include the  fact that the  epidemic  continues  to  spread.
Furthermore,  the  situation  has  become  a  humanitarian
crisis as it has resulted in a diversion of resources from
other  areas  of  need.  There  has  been  an  unprecedented
increase in the number of orphans and other vulnerable
children. Most of the health facilities are in dilapidated
condition and require upgrading.

The  financial  assistance  granted  by  the  Global
Fund came as a major boost to our national response to
HIV/AIDS.  The  resources  from  the  Global  Fund  will
enhance the concerted efforts of the Government, civil
society and the private sector and the technical support
A/58/PV.6
provided  by  UNAIDS  and  other  donors.  The
disbursement  of  the  initial  resources  from  the  Global
Fund  in  August  2003  has  increased  the  hope  of
thousands of the affected and infected population. The
increase  in  available  resources  will  help  us  scale  up
activities and implement more strategies than otherwise
would have been possible.
The country is in the process of initiating a  mass
mobilization  of  population  groups  and  sectors  for  an
enhanced  response.  National  traditional  ceremonies
involving  youth,  women  and  men  provide  an
opportunity  for  such  activities.  These  events  bring
together  a  number  of  the  population  groups,  thus
making  it  possible  to  engage  in  mass  mobilization  of
the population. A historical forum has been undertaken
bringing  together  all  religious  groupings  to  engage  in
dialogue on their role in the national response.
It should be further acknowledged that prevention
strategies will be scaled up as well, targeting behaviour
change  through  encouraging  abstinence  among  the
young  and  further  curtailing  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS
through  parent-to-child  transmission  and  accidental
occupational exposure.
The  availability  of  resources  from  the  Global
Fund  is  also  making  it  possible  for  the  country  to  try
home-grown  solutions  for  responding  to  the  epidemic.
They  include  the  revival  of  traditional  and  cultural
safety  nets  at  the  community  level,  such  as  in  the
provision of support to orphans and vulnerable persons

include  provision

initiated the establishment of youth-friendly services in

girls.
Let  me  conclude  by  expressing  the  gratitude  of
the  Government  and  the  people  of  the  Kingdom  of
Swaziland,  particularly  those  who  are  infected  and
affected by HIV/AIDS, to all those that have donated to
the  Global  Fund  and  to  all  other  programmes  and

Mr.  Gallegos  Chiriboga  (Ecuador)  (spoke  in

regarding
acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome  (AIDS)  are  its
origin  and  causes,  and  how  it  became  the  epidemic
which has spread to the point that it has become one of
the worst pandemics ever to affect mankind. The crisis
generated  by  HIV/AIDS  flourishes  in  environments  of
poverty, social disintegration and ignorance. Economic
difficulties,  external  debt  and  adjustments  have  been
aggravating  elements  for  the  crisis,  which  has  grown
faster than education and prevention.
The  Declaration  of  Commitment  on  HIV/AIDS,
adopted  by  the  General  Assembly  in  June  2001,  is  an
important step forward and a landmark in our  struggle
to  combat  this  scourge  since  it  reflects  the  sensitivity
and  the  awareness  of  the  international  community
faced  with  the  undeniable  global  dimension  of  the
problem.  It  shows,  moreover,  an  interest  in  joining
together  to  fight  this  evil,  which  is  afflicting  all
mankind.

strengthening  and  speeding  up  global  response  and  in
promoting  more

the  shortage  of  material  and  financial  resources  make
international cooperation with my country essential.
I  wish  to  reiterate  the  commitment  that  the
Government of Ecuador made at the special session of
the General Assembly in 2001, when we reaffirmed our
responsibility  to  individuals  living  with  HIV/AIDS  in
order  to  insure  safe  access  to  appropriate  health
services. In this context, we feel it is imperative for all
individuals  infected  with  the  virus  to  be  able  to
exercise  fully  their  right  to  access  to  low-cost  drugs
which will help them fight the epidemic.
In  accordance  with  the  outcome  of  the  2001
special  session  on  HIV/AIDS,  my  Government  has
drafted a national strategic plan on HIV/AIDS for 2001
to  2003.  It  focuses  on  the  following  strategic  areas:
establishing a programme of services for those who are
HIV-positive,  strengthening  mother-child  care  in  the
area  of  HIV/AIDS,  increasing  the  number  of  users  of
services  and  establishing  conditions 
special 
for
improving  access  to  necessary  medication.  Ecuador
considers in particular that developed countries should
provide  access  to  low-cost  medications  for  infected
persons, as part of the fight against the epidemic.
Allow  me  finally  to  call  on  the  international
community  to  continue  its  efforts  in  the  fight  against
this  scourge  which  has  serious  economic  and  social
consequences for all of mankind.

After  reviewing  the  report  of  the  Secretary-
General  (A/58/184)  and  other  international  reports  on
follow-up  of 
the  Declaration  of  Commitment  on
HIV/AIDS,  it  has  become  clear  to  us  that  HIV/AIDS
still  represents  one  of

development and the Millennium Goals. It also poses a
clear threat to international peace and security.
the  biggest  obstacles 
Since the  discovery  of  AIDS  more  than  20  years
ago, it has infected over 60 million people, of all races,
classes,  cultures  and  economic  levels.  It  is  the  fourth
greatest cause of death in the world.
The  United  Arab  Emirates  is  deeply  concerned
about  the  continuing  increase  in  the  rate  of  infection
worldwide,  and  particularly 
in  African  countries.
Reports  by  observers  of  the  spread  of  the  disease
indicate that there will be an estimated 45 million new
cases  of  AIDS  between  2002  and  2010.  Most  of  these
cases  will  occur  in  developing  and  poor  countries,
which  are  already  suffering  from  abject  poverty,
illiteracy and armed conflict. The disease kills millions
in the workforce, infects  millions of children under 16
and creates millions of orphans, which leads to further
deterioration  of  the  economy  and  living  conditions  of

Furthermore,  we  reiterate

The  United  Arab  Emirates  has  adopted  national
and regional strategies aimed at preventing AIDS since
it  was  discovered  more  than  20  years  ago.  It  has
succeeded, 
the  national  AIDS  prevention
programme  launched  by  the  Ministry  of  Health  in
1985,  in  reducing  the  number  of  HIV  cases  to  the
lowest  in  the  world,  with  no  demonstrable  increase
over the past  two decades, as  was  reported  in  a  World
Health Organization (WHO) report on the United Arab
Emirates and neighbouring countries.

We believe that our laws, which are derived from
the  spirit  of  Islamic  Shariah  and  the  social  traditions
and practices that prohibit certain behaviours leading to
the  spread  of  the  disease  —  such  as  illegal  sexual
relations, drug abuse and trafficking in women — have
to  a  great  extent  contributed  to  this  low  number  of
cases, along with the measures adopted by the national
programme  to  control  and  monitor  the  entry  into  the
country  of  AIDS patients  from  abroad, and  to  monitor
laboratory  workers,  hospital  patients  and  those  who
work in blood banks and pregnancy clinics.

Her  Excellency  Mrs.  Dolores  Balderamos-García,
Chairperson  of  the  delegation  and  Special  Envoy  for
Children,  Gender  Affairs  and  HIV/AIDS,  Ministry  of
Human  Development,  Local  Government  and  Labour
of Belize.
Ms.  Balderamos-García  (Belize):  We  came  to
the United Nations in 2001 fully aware of the extreme
challenge we faced as a world community. The picture
was bleak, and we set about changing the world. In the
face of a pandemic with the severity of HIV/AIDS, this
task  remains  one  of  the  most  crucial  undertakings  of
our  generation.  Since  then,  more  of  our  children  are
suffering  from  HIV/AIDS;  more  of  our  people  have
died; and  we find ourselves expending  more  and  more
funds to tackle the effects of this pandemic. Yet today,
as  a  result  of  our  collective  efforts,  we  can  celebrate
the gains we have made in the past two years.
It is estimated that, in the Caribbean and in Latin
America, 1.6 million people are living with HIV/AIDS.
The Caribbean, now the second most affected region in
the  world,  averages  approximately  a  2  per  cent
prevalence rate among  adults,  a  figure  mirrored  in  the
local reality of  my country, Belize. Belize is thus both
witness and subject to the ravages of HIV/AIDS in our
region.
In  the  face  of  this  enormous  challenge,  my
delegation  returns  to  the  United  Nations  to  offer  the
assurance  of  the  Government  of  Belize  that  it  will
continue

In  Belize,  HIV/AIDS  has  been  declared  one  of
the greatest health and human development challenges.
Our  Prime  Minister,  The  Honourable  Said  Musa,
responded  by 
the  National  AIDS
Commission,  our  country’s  coordinating  mechanism,
and has now placed it under the authority of his Office.
We  have  developed  a  multisectoral  approach  in  our
strategic plan to address this pandemic. The success of
this  multisectoral  strategy  has  been  manifested  in
enlarged  and  strengthened  partnerships  with  non-
governmental 
community-based
organizations  and  the  private  sector.  In  addition,  in  a

recently  held  Youth  Parliament,  we  saw  the  increased
involvement  and  participation  of  young  people  in
spreading the message of prevention.
We  continue,  however,  to  face  such  obstacles  as
stigma  and  discrimination  towards  persons  living  with
HIV/AIDS.  As  a  result,  the  face  of  HIV/AIDS  is  still
largely  hidden.  To  overcome  this  will  require  greater
involvement  by  all  sectors  as  well  as  a  more  strategic
response from those already participating.
We are also in the process of enacting HIV/AIDS
legislation and will shortly pass a law incorporating the
National AIDS Commission as a statutory body. This is
an important step in the implementation of our strategic
plan.
In the area of resource mobilization, local funding
has  been  increased,  and  we  are  receiving  greater
external  cooperation  —  though  not  nearly  enough.
While we acknowledge the support of agencies such as
the  Caribbean  Development  Bank,  the  United  Nations
Population Fund, the International Labour Organization
and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS),  we  are  concerned  about  the  slow  progress
of  the  implementation  of  the  Global  Fund  to  Fight
AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. We must all do  more
to realize the goal set for that Fund, for we realize that
to do otherwise could be deadly.
Through  our  Ministry  of  Health,  the  programme
on  the  prevention  of  mother-to-child  transmission  is
achieving some success. In addition, we have started to
provide  antiretroviral  medication  to  persons  in  need.
Voluntary  counselling  and  testing  centres  have  also
opened,  and  we  continue  to  increase  our  activities  to
bring greater awareness of prevention methods and safe
practices.
When  we  assess  the  social  and  economic  impact
of  HIV/AIDS  in  Belize,  we  realize  that  the  vast
majority of  those  infected are  at  their  most  productive
stage  in  life.  Their  contribution  to  our  sustainable
development is indispensable.  Responsible  governance
cannot tolerate such a loss; we must do more to protect
this valuable resource. At the same time, we are aware

the problems, and we are aware of them. We make our
commitment even stronger at all levels. The situation is
serious,  but  we  will  do  what  needs  to  be  done  to

our developing and developed partners, so that together
we can prevail in our fight against HIV/AIDS.

Mr.  Lamba  (Malawi):  On  behalf  of  the  Malawi
delegation,  I  would  like  to  join  other  speakers  in
thanking  the  Secretary-General  for  having  convened
this  meeting  to  take  stock  of  our  progress  in  the  fight
against the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
The 
interplay  between  poverty, 
famine  and
HIV/AIDS  necessitates  new  approaches 
that  must
integrate  HIV/AIDS  into  national  and  international
humanitarian  responses.  For  sub-Saharan  Africa,  and,
indeed, for Malawi, HIV/AIDS is a humanitarian crisis
of  a  complex  nature,  which  is  undermining  years  of
hard-won gains in economic and social development.
The  Government  of  Malawi  remains  fully  and
strongly committed to the fight against HIV/AIDS. The
President  himself,  Mr.  Bakili  Muluzi,  has  personally
taken  the  lead  in  championing  the  national  HIV/AIDS
response,  to  demonstrate  political  will.  That  response
has further been strengthened by the establishment of a
ministerial  portfolio

Despite  all  these  bold  efforts  and  high-level
national commitments on our part to fight this scourge,
statistics  on  trends  in  prevalence,  morbidity,  mortality
and  the  number  of  orphans  have  continued  to  show
disturbing  results.  For  example,  data  from  the  2001
sentinel  surveillance  report  revealed  a  national  adult
HIV  prevalence  rate  of  15  per  cent  —  25  per  cent  in
the urban areas and 13 per cent in the rural areas. The
risk  of  mother-to-child  transmission  of  HIV  remains
very high, with an estimated 27 per cent of infants born
to HIV-infected mothers becoming infected.
I  am,  however,  encouraged  to  report  high  levels
of  HIV  awareness  and  knowledge  among  our
population, with more than 85 per cent of the 15-24 age
group becoming very much aware of what is meant by
HIV/AIDS. About 35 per cent of people aged 15 to 24
reported  the  use  of  condoms  with  casual  partners,  a

gratifying  to  observe  that  HIV  prevalence  estimates  in
the adult population have  more or less stabilized at 15
per cent for nearly three consecutive years.

The  Acting  President: I  now  give  the  floor  to
Mr.  Alfred  Capelle,  Chairman  of  the  delegation  of  the
Republic of the Marshall Islands.
Mr. Capelle (Marshall Islands): I am honoured to
deliver this statement on behalf  of  the  Republic  of  the
Marshall  Islands.  Two  years  ago,  the  Marshall  Islands
participated  in  the  twenty-sixth  special  session  of  the
General  Assembly  and  joined  in  declaring  a  global
commitment to address the HIV/AIDS crisis.
Not  long  ago,  HIV/AIDS  was  considered  a  new
and  alarming  disease,  affecting  countries  outside  the
Pacific  region.  Today,  HIV/AIDS  has  crossed  all
borders. It is now a major concern for the countries of
the Pacific region, including the Marshall Islands. The
number of registered cases in the Marshall Islands may
be low in comparison to many other areas of the world.
However, with our very small population and high rates
of  sexually  transmitted  diseases,  the  risk  of  the  virus

to  our
Government  and  our  people.  The  potential  social  and
economic consequences pose a particularly grave threat
to small island communities such as our own.
is  a  matter  of  great  concern 
The  vulnerability  of  our  people  to  the  risk  of
infection is intensified due to various factors, including
high  mobility  within  and  across  our  borders,  risky
lifestyle  choices  of  our  youth,  who  constitute  a  high
percentage  of  the  population,  and  traditional  cultural
barriers  that  prevent  open  discussion  about  sexual
behaviours.
Although the Marshall Islands is a small country,
the  spread  of  the  population  across  many  remote
islands  presents  an  additional  challenge  in  terms  of
reaching  the  groups  most  vulnerable  to  HIV/AIDS,
which are  women and  children.  In  attempting  to reach
all  members  of  the  community,  but  particularly  those
most vulnerable groups, we have focused our efforts on
increasing local community participation in HIV/AIDS
education  and  prevention.  We  encourage  the  active,
ongoing 
non-governmental
organizations,  churches,  women’s  groups  and  other
stakeholders.

As in many other small developing countries, the
costs  of  effectively  combating  HIV/AIDS  are  more
than  our  struggling  health  system  can  sustain.  We
appeal  to  countries  with  experience  in  combating  the
disease  to  share  their  experience on  best  practices  and
to offer financial and technical assistance to developing
countries  in  need  of  medical  resources,  capacity-
building, staff training and policy development.
Among the many health concerns in the Marshall
Islands,  HIV/AIDS  poses  the  greatest  threat.  The
Government  of  the  Marshall  Islands  is  committed  to
addressing  this  threat  by  enhancing  its  efforts  to
develop  and  implement  appropriate  health,  education
and  social  policies.  We  welcome  assistance  from  the
international  community  in  that  regard.  Despite  the
many challenges faced at the national and local levels,
the  Marshall  Islands  reaffirms  its  commitment  to
support global efforts to combat HIV/AIDS.

The issue of adequate resources is critical for the
expansion  of  access 
in
developing  countries,  as  well  as  for  the  sustainability
of  the  progress  achieved  to  date.  In  Jamaica,  for
example, the high cost of antiretroviral drugs remains a
major problem. While the Government has been able to
successfully  negotiate  with 
leading  pharmaceutical
companies  for  some  reduction  in  the  price  of  these
drugs, costs are still a significant problem.
We acknowledge the efforts made with respect to
the  establishment  of  the  Global  Fund  to  provide
additional  resources,  and  we  welcome  the  agreement
reached  within  the  World  Trade  Organization  to  give
developing  countries  greater  access 
to  cheaper
medicines,  but  much  remains  to  be  done  to  move  the
process  forward.  Accordingly,  we  underscore  the  need
for  support  to  be  given  to  developing  countries  to
effectively utilize this mechanism, so that drugs can be
provided to those suffering from HIV/AIDS. We would
also  wish  to  encourage  greater  investment  in  research
and  development  on  HIV/AIDS,  and  we  urge  greater

special  emphasis  on  preventive  programmes  which

The  Acting  President:  I  call  on  His  Excellency
Mr. Murari Raj Sharma, Chairman of the delegation of
the Kingdom of Nepal.
Mr.  Sharma  (Nepal):  Today  42  million  people
are  living  with  HIV/AIDS.  In  2002  alone,  5  million
new  infections  occurred,  half  of  them  in  people  aged
15  to  24  and  more  than  95  per  cent  in  developing
countries; 3.1  million infected persons died. Those are
staggering statistics that call for an urgent, massive and
coordinated response.
The  Declaration  of  Commitment  on  HIV/AIDS,
adopted by the special session of the General Assembly
in  2001,  has  scaled  up  the  efforts  of  the  global
community to combat the disease and has provided one
more  tool  to  advance  goal  six  of  the  Millennium
Development Goals.
We  take  heart  that  the  Joint  United  Nations
Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and a number of
other United Nations agencies have been working with
Member  States  at  the  front  lines  in  the  global  fight
against  HIV/AIDS.  The  Global  Fund  to  Fight  AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria has helped reinforce the fight
significantly.  More 
than  140  countries  now  have
programmes to tackle this epidemic.
We  welcome  the  first  contributions  announced
here  today  by  the  United  States  and  the  European
Union.  This  marks  one  step  forward  in  our  collective
effort  to  tackle  HIV/AIDS.  Despite  all  that  progress,
however,  HIV/AIDS  continues  to  fan  out  to  new
countries and to claim new victims.
Nepal  is  an  example  of  where  the  epidemic  is
spreading  like  wildfire.  With  the  first  case  detected  in
1988,  Nepal  had,  according  to  World  Bank  estimates,
more than 30,000  infected  people  by  September  2000.
Some  other  estimates  put  the  figure  at  a  much  higher
level.  Nearly 3,000 people  die  from  this  disease  every
year.  The  prevalence  rate  exceeds  50  per  cent  among
intravenous  drug  users  and  70  per  cent  among  sex
workers.
Nepal is fully committed to fighting HIV/AIDS in
our  country,  but  constrained 
resources  seriously
hamper our efforts. For instance, we have established a
national  centre  and  adopted  a  national  policy  in  1995
21
A/58/PV.6
and a national strategy in 1997 to combat this disease.
A  high-level  national  council  has  been  set  up,  chaired
by the Prime Minister, with the broader participation of
civil society to help implement the national policy and
strategy.
Prevention of the disease, as well as treatment of
and  support  to  its  victims,  is  critical  to  reverse  the
surge of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In the current 5 and
to
10  year  plans,  Nepal  has  accorded  priority 
prevention 
awareness,
embracing a multisectoral approach. We have allocated
resources,  within  our  capacity,  to  implement  various
programmes in this area.

the  key  elements  of  our  strategy 
As  the  problem  has  regional  dimensions,  due  to
Nepal’s close links with high-prevalence countries and
areas,  we  have  underlined  regional  cooperation  as  one
of 
to  combat
HIV/AIDS.  In  that  context,  I  thank  UNAIDS  and  the
United Nations Children’s Fund for organizing a high-
level  regional  meeting  on  HIV/AIDS  in  Kathmandu
last February.
Gaps between the needed and available resources
remain  painfully  wide.  Given  the  limited  resources  at
its  disposal,  Nepal  needs  resources  to  carry  out  the
prevention  strategy,  as  well  as  to  treat  and  support
victims. So does South Asia in general.

respect for human rights and the ethical principles that
ensure the right to health and non-discrimination,  with
a  view  to  achieving  three  key  objectives:  to  prevent
new  infections,  to  reduce  the  negative  personal  and
social  impact  of  HIV/AIDS,  and  to  mobilize  and
coordinate efforts to combat the disease.
As  of  June  2003,  in  Uruguay  7,018  cases  had
been  reported  mainly  among  vulnerable  groups.  Of
these,  4,855  were  carriers  and  2,163  infected  persons;
1,233  have  died.  A  large  number  of  affected  persons
face  serious  social  problems,  such  as  unemployment,
discrimination,  poverty  and  family  dysfunction.  In
order  to  fight  discrimination  and  prejudice,  solidarity
and  respect  for  human  rights  are  promoted  among
workers  and  employers 
through  educational  and
information  programmes.  As  a  way  of  reducing  the

and  thanks  to  the  use  of  generic  drugs,  100  per  cent
coverage  of  antiretroviral  therapy  was  begun  in  1996,
so that all AIDS patients in Uruguay now receive equal
treatment,  regardless  of  their  social  and  economic
situation.
We therefore call on the international community
to  generously  contribute  to  the  Global  Fund  and  to
United  Nations  agencies,  as  well  as 
to  make
antiretroviral drugs available and affordable for victims
in poor countries.
However, the main objective of the strategic plan
is the prevention of new infections, particularly among
young  people  and  adolescents,  vulnerable  groups,
women,  from  mother-to-child  transmission,  and  in  the
health-care environment.
Despite 
tremendous 
scientific  progress, 
the
HIV/AIDS  epidemic  remains  a  terrible  misfortune,  a
challenge to human society and a bleak threat to human
dignity  and  existence.  We  share  the  anguish  and
suffering  of  those  living  with  HIV/AIDS.  Let  us
reaffirm  once  again  our  commitment

HIV/AIDS through concerted global action and to save
the world from this terrible epidemic.

Among the most important actions to be taken to

More than 50 per cent of the reported cases in our
country  affect  young  people  between  the  ages  of  15
and 34, who were infected in adolescence. That is why
joint  efforts  among  the  National  Youth  Institute,  the
National  Institute  for  Minors  and  non-governmental
organizations  working  with children and  young people
are essential.
With 
to  prevention  among  women,
although women in Uruguay fell victim to the epidemic
regard 
at  a  later  stage  in  its  development,  currently  the
incidence  among  women  is  steadily  rising,  owing  to  a
change  in  the  pattern  of  infection.  Last  year,  women
represented  30  per  cent of all  reported  cases  in  the  15
to  34  age  group  —  that  is,  at  the  height  of  fertility.
Therefore,  policies  are  being  implemented  to  promote
women’s  participation  in  the  design,  execution  and
evaluation of programmes and to train health personnel
in  prevention  from  a  gender  perspective.  With  respect
to  mother-to-child  transmission,  in  our  country  the
incidence  of  such  transmission  without  intervention
had  been  25  per  cent.  Thanks  to  the  introduction  of
antiretroviral  treatments  in  1997,  we  were  able  to
reduce it to 4 per cent in 2002.
Our  challenge  consists  not  only  in  undertaking
the  formidable  effort  required  for  capacity-building,
but  also  in  maintaining  such  capacities  among  all
involved  actors  for  sustained  action  to  tackle  the
multidimensional problems posed by HIV/AIDS. For a
developing  country  like  Uruguay,  the  implementation
of  a  strategic  plan  on  this  scale  is  a  titanic  task,
particularly  considering  that  the  country  suffered  the
worst economic crisis in its history last year.

this
opportunity  to  thank  the  Secretary-General  for  the
lucid  and  concise  report  (A/58/184)  before  us.  The
report allows us to evaluate the progress made towards
the implementation of  the  Declaration of  Commitment
on  HIV/AIDS  (resolution  S-26/2,  annex)  since  its
adoption  in  June  2001  at  the  twenty-sixth  special
session of the General Assembly.
As  detailed  in  the  Secretary-General’s  report,
significant  progress  has  been  made  in  the  global
response  to  HIV/AIDS.  It  is  encouraging  to  note  that
all  countries  now  have  multisectoral  HIV/AIDS
strategic  plans  and  have  established  national  AIDS
councils  chaired  at  the  highest  levels  of  Government.
Commitment on cross-country cooperation  to  fight  the
epidemic  has  also  been  enhanced  among  regional
political bodies.

achievements,  HIV/AIDS 
is
becoming  more  alarming  in  its  devastating  effect  on
socio-economic  development  in  some  affected  sub-
Saharan  African  countries.  HIV 
rates
continue  to  rise,  and  the  meagre  institutional  capacity
to fight the epidemic is being seriously undermined. It
is  therefore  time  for  the  international  community  to
intensify its efforts to raise the  HIV/AIDS  response  to
the  level  required  in  the  subregion.  Out  of  the  67
million  Ethiopians,  2.2  million  —  including  200,000
children — are living with HIV/AIDS. The rate of new
infections  has  started  to  decline,  but  the  highest
prevalence of HIV is still in the 15 to 24 age group —
an age group that is most productive.
The  Government  of  Ethiopia  attaches  prime
importance  to  the  Declaration  of  Commitment  on
HIV/AIDS and has thus taken numerous steps to speed
up  its  implementation.  My  Government  established  a
National  AIDS  Prevention  and  Control  Council,
chaired  by  the  President,  in  April  2000.  The  Council
regularly  evaluates 
the  disease’s
prevalence  rates  throughout  the  country,  disseminates
information  about  HIV/AIDS  and  promotes  awareness
at  the  national  level.  Furthermore,  several  ministries
have 
forces  and  have
designated  HIV/AIDS  focal  points  with  the  objective
of  raising  awareness  in  the  civil  service  about  the
epidemic.  The  Council  has  also  established  structures

sector of the society in its endeavour to raise awareness
about  the  epidemic.  Centres  for  the  distribution  of
antiretroviral  medicines  have  also  been  established  at
the national level.
In  terms  of  policy,  my  Government  adopted  its
first  HIV/AIDS  policy  in  1998.  It  has  since  launched
and 
implemented  numerous  policy  directives  and
guidelines to provide advice to HIV/AIDS patients and
to  intensify  the  media  campaign  about  the  epidemic.
We have also presented various proposals to the Global
Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and we
have  managed  to  secure  resources  that  have  enhanced
our capacity to fight the epidemic.

Over two years ago, at the historic special session
of  the  General  Assembly,  the  global  body  adopted  the

Declaration 
underscoring 
for  action  against
HIV/AIDS.  The  unprecedented  level  of  commitment
gathered  from  countries  around  the  world  led  to  the
adoption  of time-bound  targets in the  fight  against  the
pandemic.
I am confident that today’s review of the progress
made and the lessons learned  in  our effort  to  meet the
goals  for  2003  will  enable  us  to  devise  more  effective
action to meet the challenging goals of future years.
I  note  with  satisfaction  the  advances  made  in
many  countries,  particularly 
in  heavily  affected
countries.  As  indicated  in  the  report  of  the  Secretary-
General  (A/58/184),  the  issue  is  now  accorded  high
priority  on  many  national  agendas.  National  strategies
to  address  HIV/AIDS  have  been  established.  Greater
resources  have  been  mobilized  and  are  now  being
expended  at  the  national  and  global  levels.  Infection
among young people has declined in a growing number
of  countries.  The  developments  of  the  past  two  years
strengthen  our  hope  and  resolve  that,  with  strong
political  commitment  and  cooperation  among  all
stakeholders,  we  can  bring  the  deadly  disease  under
control.
The  challenges  facing  us,  however,  are  still
enormous.  The  number  of  infected  people  is  still
growing, with 5 million new cases detected every year.
The  prevalence  of  HIV/AIDS  in  the  Latin  American
and Caribbean and Eastern European regions shows no
sign  of  diminishing.  In  sub-Saharan  Africa,  where  11
million  children  have  lost  one  or  both  parents  to  the
disease, it is disheartening, to say the least, to think of
the long-term consequences. Despite an unprecedented
level of contributions from the governmental and other
sectors,  the  gap  between  needs  and  resources  remains
huge.
The  experience  of  the  past  two  years  has  served
to highlight several points. First, political commitment
and  leadership  must  remain  firm.  Given  the  ambitious
targets  to  be  met  by  2005,  leaders,  not  only  in
Government but also in civil society, need to strengthen
their  resolve  still  further.  HIV/AIDS  has  proved  to  be
an  intractable  enemy.  The  slightest  negligence  or
indifference  in  leadership  can  easily  result  in  huge
setbacks in our effort against HIV/AIDS.
Secondly,  we  must  do  what  we  can  right  now  to
save  the  lives  and  relieve  the  suffering  of  those
affected  by  HIV/AIDS.  The  Korean  Government  is
providing  people  with  an  HIV/AIDS  antiretroviral
agent  for  free.  We  must  continue  to  strive  to  make
drugs available at a reasonable cost, especially to those
in the developing countries.
should 
international
support  mechanisms.  Many  developing  countries  are
still without adequate resources to address the problem
of  HIV/AIDS  effectively.  In  that  regard,  the  Korean
Government  is  endeavouring  to  ensure  that  it  will  be
able  to  deliver  its  contribution  to  the  Global  Fund  in
the near future.
Thirdly,  we 
strengthen 
Fourthly, prevention  should continue to be at  the
centre of our efforts. The Republic of Korea, which had
been  considered  relatively  safe  from  HIV/AIDS,  has
recently  experienced  a  dramatic  rise  in  the  number  of
people infected, especially young adults. In response to
this  challenge,  the  Korean  Government,  working  in
close partnership with non-governmental organizations,
is now focusing on the development of prevention and
awareness programmes for the younger generation.
Lastly,  greater  attention  should  be  paid  to  the
rights and needs of those infected by HIV/AIDS. Legal
protection  is  essential,  but  it  is  not  enough.  Social
stigmatization  and  marginalization  will  be  eliminated
only  when  there  is  a  general  change  in  attitude,  and
that calls for active publicity campaigns.
During the two years since the special session, we
have  achieved  a  great  deal. Yet  much  still  needs  to  be
done.  Perhaps  the  most  important  point  to  take  away
from  today’s  discussion  is  that  we  cannot  relax  our
vigilance  or  relent  in  our  efforts.  It  is  imperative  that
we continue to be alert.

the  needs  of  those  infected  with  HIV/AIDS  and  their
families,  and  in  protecting  the  human  rights  of  the
infected.  Meeting  those  targets  will  be  no  easy  task.
But as the past two years have shown, we can do it by
working 
together  with  steady  determination.  Our
efforts  will  be  fully  rewarded  when  our  children  can
live  in  a  world  free  from  the  dark  shadow  of  the
disease.
The  Acting  President:  I  now  give  the  floor  to
His Excellency Mr. Christian Wenaweser, Chairman of
the delegation of the Principality of Liechtenstein.
Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): The adoption of
the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS in 2001
provided  us  with  a  timely  instrument  to  use  in  our
common fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic. As we
reach the first target date contained in the Declaration,
the  record  of  implementation  is  mixed.  There  was  a
strong  initial  momentum,  which  led,  inter  alia,  to  the
Global  Fund to  Fight  AIDS,  Tuberculosis  and  Malaria
quickly  becoming  operational.  Keeping  up 
this
momentum,  nationally  and  internationally,  and  not

is the purpose of today’s meetings.
crises  divert  our 
attention 
We live in a rapidly changing world characterized
by  a quick  succession  of  crises  of  all  sorts. The  threat
posed by HIV/AIDS will be with us for  many  years to
come  and,  if  we  are  to  be  successful,  we  must  be
consistent in our will to fight it. The leadership shown
by  the  United  States  of  America  and  the  European
Union  will  hopefully  lead  to  sustained  support  for  the
Global  Fund,  which  we  consider  a  valuable  means  to
fight  the  pandemic.  Liechtenstein  made  an  initial
contribution to the Fund of 100,000 Swiss francs and is
now  in  the  process  of  determining  the  size  of  its  next
contribution.
HIV/AIDS  constitutes  not  only  a  global  health
threat,  but,  indeed,  one  of  the  main  obstacles  to
development.  The  common  fight  against 
thus
constitutes an investment in the future of mankind. The
experience  gained  in  recent  years  makes  it  clear  that
prevention  and  care  and  treatment  strategies  must  be
considered  to  be  complementary.  The  financial  and
human costs of prevention are, of course, much smaller

Poverty  and  inadequate  access  to  education,  in
particular 
information  on  sexual  and  reproductive
health,  rank  highest  among  the  factors  that  contribute
to  the  destructive  spread  of  the  disease.  Such  factors
are then compounded by discrimination against people
living with HIV/AIDS.
We 
thus  welcome 
the  Secretary-General’s
emphasis  on  the  aspect  of  human  rights  in  the  fight
against  HIV/AIDS.  Both  the  consequences  and  the
eradication  of  HIV/AIDS  are  inextricably  linked  to
human 
rights.  Stigmatization  and  discrimination
against  people  living  with  the  disease  exacerbate  the
effects of the virus by adding to its disastrous effects in
destroying families and communities.
People  living  with  HIV/AIDS  can  contribute
much  to  the  fight  against  the  epidemic  of  which  they
have  become  a  victim.  Indeed,  some  of  the  strongest
leadership  in  the  fight  against  HIV/AIDS  has  been
shown by people who themselves live with the disease.

In  that  context,  special  attention  must  be  paid  to
the  rights  of  women  and  girls,  as  was  done  in  the
Declaration  of  Commitment.  Women  and  girls  are  not
only  biologically  more  susceptible  to  infection  when
not  protected;  they  are  often  much  more  vulnerable
because  of  societal  and  structural  inadequacies,  not  to
mention manifestations of discrimination. Policies need
to  be  enacted  to  make  women  economically  more
independent  and  to  reduce  their  risk  of  being  sexually
victimized.  Widows  and  —  ever  more  frequently —

The  Assembly’s  special  session  of  2  June  2001
was  an  opportunity  for  my  delegation  to  put  forward
the  broad  policy  guidelines  of  Guinea  in  the  fight
against  HIV/AIDS.  Confronted  with  the  threats  of
emerging  or  re-emerging  diseases,  particularly  the
sexually  transmitted  disease  AIDS,  a  national  health
plan  2000-2010  was  launched  to  stabilize  or  reduce
their social and economic impact.

Despite  the  establishment  of  a  national  coalition
to  combat  AIDS,  comprised  of  the  Government,  its
development  partners,

Programme  on  HIV/AIDS  team  and  national  and
international  organizations,  HIV/AIDS  is  spreading  in
Guinea  at  an  alarming  rate.  Furthermore,  according  to
the  most 
the
Government,  the  rate  of  infection  of  the  population  is
close  to  2.8  per  cent.  According  to  projections,  the
number  of  HIV-infected  persons  will  double,  reaching
more  than  282,000  between  now  and  2010  unless
sweeping  measures  are  taken.  To  reverse  this  trend,
many initiatives have been undertaken  in  the  Republic
of  Guinea.  The  Government  has  given  priority  to
financing  prevention  projects  and  spreading  public
awareness  among  young  adolescents,  women  and
workers.  The  efforts  of  the  First  Lady  of  Guinea  to
reduce  mother-to-child transmission and the  drafting  a
27
A/58/PV.6
public  information  guide  for  the  eradication  of  AIDS
are part of this new process.
Guinea  is  stepping  up  its  mobilization  to  combat
the devastating effects of HIV/AIDS. But to succeed, it
needs the support of the international community. This
is  why  it  welcomes  the  agreement  on  generic  drugs
reached  30  August  2003  and  the  Secretary-General’s
establishment  of  the  Commission  for  HIV/AIDS  and
Governance  in  Africa,  presided  over  by  the  Executive
Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa.
We  would  like  to  express  our  gratitude  to  the
United States, the European Union and other donors for
their  substantial  contributions  to  the  Global  Fund  to
Fight  AIDS,  Tuberculosis  and  Malaria.  We  are
convinced that this will contribute to the success of the
implementation  of  the  Declaration  of  Commitment  on
HIV/AIDS.  My  delegation  would  like  to  thank  the
various  partners  who,  despite  numerous  difficulties,
have spared no effort to support my country’s actions.
Despite 
the  progress  made,  my  delegation
remains  convinced  that  further  considerable  efforts
must  be  made  to  prevail  in  the  fight  against  the
HIV/AIDS  pandemic.  To  reach  that  objective,  it  is
crucial,  now  more  than  ever,  to  promote  the  present
partnership, coordinate our activities  more closely  and
unite actors at all levels.
The  Acting  President:  I  now  give  the  floor  to

In addition, a fund for drugs  was established this
year  to  reduce  the  economic  impact  of  antiretroviral

people  and,  in  Lima,  we  took  part  in  a  round  of
negotiations  with  other  countries  of  the  region  and
pharmaceutical companies to obtain a reduction in drug
prices,  which,  unquestionably,  is  a  good  step  towards
ensuring universal access to treatment.
We have allocated additional resources to the area
of prevention, focused our action on our young people
and  taken  into  account  the  most  vulnerable  groups  by
implementing a  strategy of information, education  and

is 
Nevertheless, fulfilling agreements in the medium
term  has  been  challenging.  It  has  been  difficult  to
secure  the  commitment  of  other  sectors  outside  health
care  and  work  in  particular  environments  such  as  the
private  sector.  Furthermore,  the  conservative  groups
are  opposed  to  the  implementation  of  specific  and
sustained  sex  education  programmes  in  schools.  The
difficulties are  compounded  by  limited  funding  in  this
area.
Although  Colombia  has  specific  HIV/AIDS
legislation,  with a strong human-rights component  and
full  constitutional  backing,  sometimes,  in  efforts  to
enforce  the  law  and  avoid  discrimination  and  clear
violations  of  rights,  the  effective  implementation  of
this legislation is hindered on  the  ground because  of  a
lack of understanding of the law or fear on the part  of
the affected parties. Consequently, there is a challenge
to  implementing  strategies  to  empower  minorities  and
the  most vulnerable groups  to  understand and  exercise
their rights and, above all, to reject all kinds of sexual

If  we
understand  public  health  as  a  collective  obligation  of
society to assure healthy conditions for the population,
it  will  always  be  necessary  to  consider  the  inequality
and  socio-economic  vulnerability  caused  by  the  ever-
increasing incidence of AIDS. In the same way that the
best educational process will not have a positive effect
on a woman who continues to be subjected to physical
and  emotional  abuse,  discrimination  and  economic
dependency,  it  will  not  be  easy  for  our  country  to
establish  effective  prevention  mechanisms  if  it  suffers
from  the  aftermath  of  violence,  the  scourge  of  drug
trafficking and a crushing debt burden.
The State and civil society will make every effort
to fight AIDS, with the significant support of resources
obtained through the Global Fund, which will,  without
doubt,  strengthen  Colombia’s  capacity  to  respond  to
the epidemic. This is all  the more relevant if  we think
of this initiative not as an AIDS prevention programme
to improve our human development index, but rather as
a  development  project  that  will  have  a  major  positive
influence on AIDS statistics. If we really want to stem
the  spread  of  this  epidemic,  we  must  promote  the
processes that truly favour the development of the most
affected countries and peoples.

therefore  no  need  for  further  recitation.  Since  the
adoption  by 
the  General
Assembly  on  HIV/AIDS  of  resolution  S-26/2  in  June

an enabling policy environment to combat HIV/AIDS.

The  Acting  President:  I  call  on  His  Excellency
Mr. Ahmed Tahir Baduri, chairman of the delegation of
Eritrea.
Mr.  Baduri  (Eritrea):  Allow  me  to  begin  by
extending  gratitude  to  Secretary-General  Kofi  Annan
for  his  commitment  to,  and  exemplary  leadership  in,
the struggle against the catastrophic, global HIV/AIDS
crisis.  My  delegation  also  takes  this  opportunity  to
thank  him  for  his  comprehensive  report,  contained  in
document A/58/184.
The  Declaration  of  Commitment,  adopted  by  the
twenty-sixth  special  session  of  the  General  Assembly
in  2001,  has  been  a  significant  demonstration  of
humanity’s  collective  determination  to  eradicate  the
scourge. Yet, it is dismaying to note that in spite of the
determination and collective efforts of the international
community  to  eradicate  it,  HIV/AIDS  continues  to
decimate  populations  around  the  world  without  any
encouraging sign of a cure.

The  prevalence  of  HIV/AIDS

comparatively much less than in the rest of Africa. For

the

probable prevalence rate in the general population. Yet,
by  December  2002,  there  were  only  15,698  reported
cases  of  AIDS.  That  would  constitute  0.6  per  cent  of
the  population  living  in  Eritrea.  We  are,  however,
gravely concerned by the antenatal  statistics,  and  have
been vigilant ever since our liberation 12 years ago.

small  number  of  cases  can  be  detrimental  to  our

scourge  is  most  prevalent  among  males  between  the
ages  of  25  and  34,  and  females  between  20  and  23,
who make up the critical core of the workforce.
The  Eritrean  Government  had  launched  its  first
five-year  plan  (1997-2001),  even  before  the  United
Nations  summit  on  HIV/AIDS.  As  an  implementing
agency,  the  five-year  plan  created  a  National  AIDS

Diseases  Control  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Health.

of  programmes  for  the  prevention  of  mother-to-child

Thus,  following  a  long  process  of  assessment  of

Mr. Alexandre (Haiti) (spoke in French): We are
meeting  today  in  plenary  to  discuss  HIV/AIDS,  a
subject  of  great 
the
conscience of all. Its harmful impact on populations on
a global scale, its accelerated spread and the exorbitant
cost of medications, which makes them inaccessible to
the poorest countries, poses a grave threat to the world.
Indeed,  estimates  made  by  experts  and  the  calls  of
national and international leaders are cause for alarm.
The Republic of Haiti remains the country in the
region  most  affected  by  the  AIDS  pandemic  and  by
poverty, which together are doing incalculable damage.
Haiti has seen its rate of HIV incidence go from 4.5 per
cent to 6 per cent,  with rates as high as 13 per cent  in
certain rural areas.
A total of 250,000 people between the ages of 15
and  49,  half  of  whom  are  women,  live  with  the  virus,
and  there  are  200,000  AIDS  orphans.  Haiti  is  terribly
affected  by  this  scourge,  which  last  year  affected
30,000  citizens  and  is  at  this  time  one  of  the  main
causes of mortality.
The  pandemic 
is  exacerbating 
the  already
precarious  economic  situation  in  the  country  and
remains the primary challenge  facing the  Government,
which  continues  to  work  tirelessly  to  implement  the
commitments  taken  pursuant  to  the  Declaration  of
Commitment on HIV/AIDS, in June 2001.
The President of the Republic, Mr. Jean Bertrand
Aristide,  and  the  First  Lady  have  with  great  resolve
committed  themselves  to  the  struggle  against  this
disease.  Thus 
launched  a
strategic  plan  for  the  period  2002-2005  to  combat
HIV/AIDS,  which  for  Haiti  is  a  national  priority.  The
plan focuses on prevention; care of the sick throughout

The Government of the Republic is very aware of

private  sector,  non-governmental  organizations  and

commitment, the Haitian Government has set up a plan
which receives financial support from the Global Fund
to  Fight  AIDS,  Tuberculosis  and  Malaria.  Haiti  was
thus one of the first countries to sign a grant agreement
with  the  Global  Fund.  To  date,  the  programme  has
opened  health  centres  and  dispensaries  in  several
geographical  areas.  It  has  also  increased  from  one  to
six  the  number  of  institutions  that  offer  assistance  to
persons living  with  AIDS, and  has  made it possible to
treat several hundred patients.
The  number  of  blood  transfusion  centres  has
doubled,  and  seven  new  centres  for  counselling  and
examinations have been opened. An increasing number
of  pregnant  women  now  have  access  to  maternal  care
services,  and  preventive-education  and  nutritional
programmes for affected families have been set up.
With  international  assistance  and  that  of  non-
governmental  organizations,  many  projects  are  under
way  and  are  being  developed  in  order  to  set  up  a
physical  infrastructure  and  to  ensure  that  there  is
competent  technical  personnel  to  support  the  efforts
that are being made.
Financial  assistance  from  the  Global  Fund  is
aimed,  inter  alia,  at  guaranteeing  blood  transfusions,
providing antiretroviral drugs to more than 1,200 HIV-
positive  people,  distributing  more  than  15  million
condoms, raising the awareness of and educating  more
than  400,000  young  people  by  the  end  of  this  year;

well as with foreign cooperation.
Special attention  will  be devoted to  sex  workers,
and  home  visits  to  affected  communities  are  being

Mr.  Arzeno  (Dominican  Republic)  (spoke  in
Spanish):  The  final  Declaration  adopted  at  the  special
session  of  the  General  Assembly  held  in  June  2001
charted  an  important,  innovative  course  in  the  combat
against  the  HIV/AIDS  pandemic.  HIV/AIDS  is  a
serious threat to the development of our peoples and, as
a result, to peace and security.
With  this  vision,  we  returned  to  our  country,
taking advantage of the fact that our head of State had
recently created a body at the highest level of the State
to  lead  the  fight  against  HIV/AIDS:  the  Presidential
AIDS Council (COPRESIDA), with the participation of

Our  region  is  also  characterized  by  high  migratory
rates  towards  the  United  States,  to  every  one  of  the

say that the  epicentre of the epidemic in the  Americas

it, 
The  prognosis  for  the  epidemic  in  1990  was  that
in  2005 
the  Dominican  Republic  would  have  a
prevalence  rate  of  5  per  cent,  close  to  the  current
prevalence rate of Haiti, which is roughly 5.8 per cent.
However, data provided  by  the  most  recent population
and  health  survey  of  the  Dominican  Republic  shows
that the prevalence rate is 1.7 per cent, which indicates
that  the  epidemic  is  levelling  off.  These  results  in  our
war against HIV/AIDS, of which we are proud, are the
product  of  neither  chance  nor  luck.  They  are  the
product  of  a  political  commitment  that  the  Dominican
Government  has  assumed  through  a  national  strategic
plan  drawn  up  by  Government  experts,  the  private
sector, civil society and representatives of international
organizations.
In  August  2000,  the  Dominican  Government
began  a  financing  effort,  with  the  World  Bank,  which
was  supported  unanimously  by  the  national  congress.
With  this  funding,  we  implemented  a  multisectoral
mobilization, which involved all of Dominican society,
including the  Government, private  sector,  civil  society
and international organizations.
As  a  result  of  concerted  national  efforts,  we
received the backing of the Global Fund in the form of
$44  million  over  five  years.  We  also  received  support
from the Clinton Foundation that will make it possible
to  strengthen  a  gradual  coverage  programme  for
antiretrovirals  for  HIV-positive  people  who  require

Recently,  the  Government  took  advantage  of  the
publicity  provided  by  two  major  events  in  order  to  tie
in  our  HIV/AIDS  campaign.  Miss  Universe,  Amelia
Vega,  visited  our  country  and  conducted  an  intense
solidarity  campaign  by  visiting  hospitals,  HIV/AIDS
prevention  clinics  and  communities,  and

awareness. Secondly, our country hosted 42 nations for
three  weeks  for  the  celebration  of  the  fourteenth  Pan-
American  Games  of  2003.  During  the  games,  we
launched  an  HIV/AIDS  prevention  programme  among
athletes  and  spectators  with  brochures  and  banners
throughout  Santo  Domingo  promoting 
the  use  of
condoms as well as other preventive measures.

television, radio and  magazine space free of charge —
worth about $1 million a year — for messages dealing
with HIV/AIDS prevention.
Finally,  with  respect  to  the  results  and  impact  of
the  HIV/AIDS  campaign  in  our  country,  we  should
mention  the  following  points.  First,  there  has  been  a
substantial  increase  in  the  number  of  actions  against
the epidemic, developed by the health sector.
Secondly,  23  participation  agreements  between
departments  and  sectoral  programmes  have  been
formalized,  the  most  notable  examples  being 
the
initiation  of  the  sex  education  programme  in  schools,
the  formal  commitment  of  the  public  and  private
tourism sector and the multi-sectoral agreement for the
prevention of  HIV/AIDS and  against discrimination in
the work place.
Thirdly,  the  theme  of  HIV/AIDS  is  a  priority  in
the political agenda for the country’s development.
Fourthly,  the  Presidential  AIDS  Council  has
articulated  and  put  into  action  mechanisms  that  make
possible a consistent national response to the epidemic.
Fifthly,  as  an  external  sign  of  recognition  of  the
Dominican  programme,

drugs,  in  line  with  the  Trade-Related  Aspects  of

election  to  preside  over  this  special  session  of  the
General  Assembly  devoted  to  the  follow-up  to  the
outcome  of  the  implementation  of  the  Declaration  of

The  people  and  Government  of  Honduras,
particularly 
infected  with  AIDS,
tuberculosis  and  malaria,  send  to  the  Assembly  their
message  of  solidarity  to  the  peoples  represented  here,
who,  like  us,  are  constantly  seeking  to  alleviate  the
great  economic  and  social  hardship  of  those  diseases,
which,  year  after  year,  destroy  wide  sectors  of  our
population,  usually  the  most  vulnerable,  the  poorest
and the dispossessed.
When  the  United  Nations,  at  events  of  this  kind,
brings together the highest political representatives and
when they raise their voices to contribute to  seeking  a
global  solution  to  these  problems,  hope  is  reborn  and
faith in a possible solution grows. The President of the
French  Republic  said  this  morning:  “The  spread  of
HIV/AIDS is no longer insuperable and inevitable. We
now  have  the  means  to  bring  it  under  control.”
(A/58/PV.3,  p.11)  Our  people,  who  have  been  greatly
affected  by  this  disease,  believe  in  this  premise  and
focus their efforts at the national level in order to help
contribute to this collective effort.

Mr.  Nesho  (Albania):  HIV/AIDS 
is  a  very
serious and troublesome issue of our world today. It is
emerging as one of the great economic, social, security
and  development  challenges  of 
this  new  century
because  of  its  dramatic  and  devastating  impact.  The
world  community  has  to  face  it  with  courage  and
dedication.  It  is  a  big  battle  that  we  all  have  to  fight
and  win  through  united  efforts,  shared  responsibility
and serious commitment on the part of everyone.

In  that  context,  we  highly  appreciate  this  high-
level plenary  on  HIV/AIDS.  Its  scheduling  just  before
the  opening  of  the  regular  General  Assembly  session,
makes an important point as it is clear evidence of the
concern and attention that the international community
in general and the United Nations in particular continue
to  focus  on  this  very  crucial  issue.  It  highlights  the
priority  that  the  Organization  and  its  Member  States
place  on  achieving  the  goals  of  the  Declaration  of
Commitment on HIV/AIDS (resolution S-26/2, annex),
adopted at the special session of the General Assembly
in 2001. We think it fitting at this meeting to commend
the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS for
its efforts in the two priority areas of: increasing global
through  education  and
awareness  of 
dissemination  of 
the  public;  and
strengthening  the  capacity  of  communities  through
participation  by  civil  society  in  the  fight  against  the
disease.

We also welcome the rapid commencement of the

thanks to all its donors. The Fund remains an essential
tool of the world community in striving to achieve the
sixth  Millennium  Development  Goal:  combating
HIV/AIDS,  malaria  and  other  diseases.  We  are
confident  that  success  will  be  achieved  in  that  field
through active collaboration on the part of all partners,
including Governments, international organizations, the
private sector and civil society.
On  behalf  of  my  Government,  I  should  like  to
reaffirm our commitment to be an active partner in this
common  endeavour  and  to  do  our  part  to  help  sustain
the  momentum  created  by  those  important  plenary
meetings.  We  are  confident  that  these  meetings  will
add  considerably  to  previous  relentless  efforts  on  this
non-controversial  issue  and  to  the  further  rallying  of
the  world  to  increased  action  on  global  HIV/AIDS
awareness, prevention and care.
Albania  has  joined  the  global  consensus  that  has
emerged  on  the  actions  necessary  to  fight  the  disease.
Although we are not a heavily affected country, we are
devoting attention to this issue. National policies, plans
and programmes are being implemented in all the areas
requested  —  awareness,  prevention  and  care  —  as
parts  of  our  national  strategy.  During  the  past  year,

Still,  it  is  not  likely  that  the  Government  acting

efforts 
and

critical  role  in  the  fight  against  HIV/AIDS.  Through
their  partnership  with 
the  Government  and  with
international  donors  and  organizations,  various  public
activities have been organized, with a focus on areas of
expertise such as education, communication, promoting

For  my  Government,  unconditional  respect  for
the rights of persons living with HIV/AIDS and for the
rights  of  the  most  vulnerable  population  is  not  only  a
duty of the State, but also a requirement for progress in
controlling  the  epidemic.  Therefore,  the  President  of
the  Republic  promulgated  a  law  that  defines  the
Chilean  State’s  responsibility  in  AIDS  prevention  and
that aims to promote prevention and non-discrimination
against persons living with the disease.
The  participation  of  civil  society  and 
the
epidemiological nature of AIDS served as the basis for
the  elaboration  of  a  participatory,  intersectoral  and
decentralized  working  strategy,  our  national  response
to  the  HIV/AIDS  epidemic.  Its  greatest  merit  lies  in
combining 
the  efforts  of  other
institutions of the State, of civil society — particularly
persons  living  with  HIV/AIDS  —  of  the  academic
world  and  of  scientific  societies.  Although  we  must

plan deserves special mention in that regard.
Chile  is  developing  a  comprehensive  care  model
that includes antiretroviral treatment  and the  treatment
of  opportunistic  infections;  the  definition  and  periodic

estimated  that  more  than  150,000  people  are  living
with HIV and that 42,000 children have been orphaned
as a result of the disease, 25,000 of whom are infected
with the virus.
This fearsome disease is continuing to ravage the
population, jeopardizing the lives of innocent children.
It  is  the  result  of  a  lack  of  awareness  on  the  part  of
adults,  as  well  as  of  human  error.  AIDS  is  no  longer
just  a  public  health  issue;  it  is  also  a  development
issue.  In  response  to  the  scourge,  which  is  clearly
acting  as  a  brake  on 
increasingly  precarious
development of our country, my Government set up the

Furthermore,  the  Government  has  launched  a

giving  additional  impetus  to  the  fight  against  the

rate  of  HIV  infection  and  to  reduce  the  impact  of  the
virus  on  those  infected.  The  project  has  three  main
components:  support  for  civil  society;  support  for  the

Despite  all of the  efforts  of  our  Government  and
of the international community through the adoption of
such  plans  and  projects,  HIV/AIDS  is  continuing  to
spread,  as  various  studies  have  shown.  We  concluded,
therefore,  that  it  was  necessary  to  institute  a  new
planning process that took into account the outcome of
analyses  of  and  responses  to  the  situation,  as  well  as
factors determining the spread of infection, with a view
to  developing  an  appropriate  multisectoral  plan.  My
country  has  therefore  adopted  a  new  policy  to  fight
AIDS:  the  National  Strategic  Framework  to  Combat
AIDS in Benin. The Framework defines guidelines and
the  main  areas,  strategies  and  priority  actions  to
combat  the  pandemic  over  the  next  five  years.  It
focuses  on  14  main  objectives  and  has  as

This new strategy has enabled us, since February
2002,  to  treat  with  antiretroviral  drugs  380  people
living  with  HIV/AIDS,  and  we  are  in  the  process  of
stepping  up  that  programme,  thanks  to  the  support  of
the  Global  Fund.  Despite  such  positive  results,  great
efforts  will  still  have  to  be  made  to  ensure  that
thousands  of  sick  people  can  be  treated  and  cared  for,
and the impact of the epidemic thereby reduced.
I  would  like,  on  behalf  of  the  Government  of
Benin, to thank all of our development partners and the
non-governmental organizations, which have spared no
efforts to help our country in its  daily  struggle  against
this scourge.
Finally,  we  ardently  hope  that,  over  and  above
experience  sharing  and  the  implementation  of  our
policies,  our  countries  will  be  able  rapidly  to  achieve
greater  synergy  in  their  various  actions  and  initiatives
in the relentless struggle against this terrible disease.
The  Acting  President:  I  give  the  floor  to  His
Excellency Mr. Mwelwa C. Musambachime, Chairman
of the delegation of the Republic of Zambia.
Mr. Musambachime (Zambia): My delegation is
pleased  to  participate  in  the  deliberations  of  these
important meetings on the outcome of the twenty-sixth
special  session  of  the  General  Assembly  and  on  the
implementation  of  the  Declaration  of  Commitment  on
HIV/AIDS.  It  is  now  more  than  two  years  since  that
Declaration  was  adopted  by  the  General  Assembly  in
June 2001. The global challenge to  combat  HIV/AIDS
has  not  diminished,  as  we  are  still  far  from  achieving
the targets we set for ourselves in the Declaration.
We need to remind ourselves of the grim realities
of  this  epidemic.  Currently,  at  least  42  million  people
worldwide  are  estimated  to  be  living  with  HIV/AIDS.
Five  million  people  were  infected  in  2002,  while  3.1
million died from the disease in that year alone. In sub-
Saharan  Africa, 
the
epidemic, 29.4 million people are living with the virus,
58 per cent of whom are women.
the  region  most  affected  by 
In  terms  of  its  impact,  the  disease  has  had
devastating and profound effects on all socio-economic
sectors  and  all  levels  of  society,  affecting  individuals,
households  and  entire  communities.  In  the  southern
part  of  Africa,  HIV/AIDS  has  combined  with  other
factors,  such  as  drought  and  flood,  to  cause  a  steady
fall in agricultural production — the principal means of
livelihood  for  much  of  the  population  —  thus  further
impoverishing  vast  numbers  of  people  and  weakening
their coping mechanisms.
It  is  pertinent,  therefore,  that  we  should  once
again  assemble  here  to  take  stock  of  where  we  stand
and  to  evaluate  what  progress  has  been  made  in  the
implementation  of  the  Declaration.  It  is  in  that  regard
that  I  wish  to  thank  the  Secretary-General  for  having
called  for  these  very  important  meetings  and  to  pay
tribute 
to  him  for  his  personal  commitment  and
leadership in the global fight against HIV/AIDS.

The  Acting  President: 
In  accordance  with

Eminence  Cardinal  Claudio  Hummes,  Archbishop  of

Delegation of the Holy See.

Archbishop  Hummes  (Holy  See)  (spoke

Spanish):  First,  on  behalf  of  my  delegation,  let  me
convey  to  the  United  Nations  our  condolences  for  the
victims of the attacks in Baghdad yesterday and on 19
August. I hope that the path towards a constructive and
lasting  peace  will  become  increasingly  possible.  We
will  remember  the  families  of  the  victims  in  our
prayers.

We  express  our  sincere  appreciation 
the
Assembly  President  for  presiding  over  the  high-level
plenary meetings on HIV/AIDS. It is a most opportune
initiative,  expressing  the  international  community’s
resolve  to  create  more  effective  strategies  to  address
the  challenges  posed  by  this  epidemic  and  other
preventable  diseases,  such  as  malaria,  cholera  and
tuberculosis.
Zambia  has  a  long  way  to  go  in  its  fight  to
combat  this  scourge.  The  areas  currently  in  need  of
even greater effort and support include the availability
HIV/AIDS  continues  to  be  one  of  the  greatest
tragedies of our time. It is not only a health problem of
enormous  magnitude,  it  is  a  social,  economic  and
39
A/58/PV.6
political  question  as  well.  And,  as  my  delegation  has
already  underlined  many  times  here  at  the  United
Nations  and  in  similar  forums  elsewhere,  it  is  also  a
moral  question  because  the  causes  of  the  epidemic
clearly  reflect  a  serious  crisis  of  values.  Its  rapid
spread  and 
tragic  consequences  have  spared  no
geographic  segment  of  the  human  family.  In  2001,  on
the  occasion  of  the  Tenth  Ordinary  General  Assembly
of  the  Synod  of  Bishops  of  the  Catholic  Church,  the
bishops  of  sub-Saharan  Africa  launched  an  appeal  to
the  international  community  for  urgent  help  in  their
battle  against  this  plague  that  is  reaping  a  fearful
harvest of death in that region.
Allow  me to  draw  special  attention to one  of  the
most vulnerable groups among HIV/AIDS victims: our
children.  So  many  of  them  have  been  and  continue  to
be  victims  of  the  epidemic,  either  because  they  have
been infected by the  virus, passed  on  to  them  by  birth
or because they have become orphans due to the AIDS-
related premature death of their parents.
The urgent need to treat those young patients can
be  met  through  the  advances  in  medical  science.
Unfortunately, the cost of medical treatment is high and
is often beyond the reach not only of the poor but even
of  those  in  the  middle  income  bracket.  This  economic
problem  is  compounded  by  legal  issues,  such  as
contentious  interpretations  of  the  right  to  intellectual
property.  My  delegation  is  heartened  by  the  World
Trade  Organization  agreement  reached  last  30  August
2003,  which  will  make  it  easier  for  poorer  States  to
import  cheaper  generic  pharmaceuticals  made  under
compulsory  licensing.  That  agreement  should  give
those  young  patients  greater  access  to  medicines.  We
dare  to  hope  for  further  such  concrete  expressions  of
political will and moral courage.
The  Holy  See  and  the  Catholic  institutions  have
not  shirked  from  the  global  fight  against  HIV/AIDS.
My  delegation  is  pleased  to  note  that  12  per  cent  of
care  providers  for  HIV/AIDS  patients  are  agencies  of
the Catholic Church and 13 per cent of global relief for
those  affected  by  the  epidemic  comes  from  Catholic
non-governmental organizations. The Holy See, thanks
to  its  institutions  worldwide,  provides  25  per  cent  of
the  total  care  given  to  HIV/AIDS  victims,  making  it
one  of  the  leading  protagonists  in  the  field,  more
specifically,  one  of  the  most  ubiquitous  and  best
providers of care for the victims.
40
In  fact,  by  the  end  of  this  year,  through  the
Pontifical Council for Health Care and various Catholic
organizations,  the  Holy  See  will  have  reached  its
objective  of  having  operational 
institutions  and
programmes  in  all  sub-Saharan  African  countries  and
its  objective  of  starting  new  such  programmes  in
Brazil,  Argentina,  Mexico,  Thailand  and  Lithuania,  in
addition  to  those  already  existing  in  other  countries
worldwide.  They  offer  wide-ranging  services,  from
awareness campaigns to education towards responsible
behaviour,  from  psychological  assistance  to  moral
support,  from  nutrition  centres  to  orphanages,  from
hospital 
to  home  and  prison  care  for
treatment 
HIV/AIDS patients.
In closing, let  me reiterate  the  willingness  of  the
Holy See to cooperate with the rest of the international
community in combating the scourge of the century, in
mitigating  its  present  devastating  impact,  in  arresting
its menacing spectre cast across the globe, to prevent it
from  claiming  the  lives  of  future  generations.  We
cannot fail to rise to this daunting challenge.
The  Acting  President: 
In  accordance  with
General Assembly resolution 49/2 of 19 October 1994,
I now call on His  Excellency  Mr. Juan  Manuel  Suárez
del  Toro,  President  of  the  International  Federation  of
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
Mr. Suárez del Toro (International Federation of
Red  Cross  and  Red  Crescent  Societies)  (spoke  in
Spanish):  I  speak  today  on  behalf  of  the  International
Federation  of  Red  Cross  and  Red  Crescent  Societies.
We  are  an  international  organization  with  a  presence
here  and  with  links  to  civil  society.  That  is  why  I  am
speaking with a great feeling of responsibility.
Much has been said about the economic impact of
the  HIV/AIDS epidemic  and the  threat that it poses  to
security and stability in the world. The projections  are
truly frightening. HIV/AIDS  will kill  more people this
decade  than  all  the  wars  and  disasters  of  the  past  50
years.  But  this  simply  must  not  become  a  cold  debate
about numbers and figures. Instead, we must make this
an  ethical  debate,  and  move  away  from  the  ethics  of
mere survival to the ethics of dignity. The fact that the
debates  have  turned  into  discussions  on  how  much
money  is  needed  or  what  types  of  intervention  we
should  or  should  not  do  is  indecent  and  an  affront  to
the  dignity  of  every  affected  person.  Meanwhile,
millions  of  people  continue  to  suffer  and  die  from  the
epidemic.  Meanwhile,  attitudes  and  policies  continue
to  discriminate  against  people  living  with  HIV/AIDS
and  impede  our  efforts  to  respond  to  the  crisis.  If  we
must speak of numbers, let us talk about the investment
that is necessary to prevent and alleviate suffering and
protect human dignity.
The  time  for  debate  is  long  behind  us.  There  are
no  mysteries  here.  We  know  what  we  need  to  do,  and
we know how to do it. We know that we can defeat this
terrible  epidemic.  The  Declaration  of  Commitment
mentions  the  need  to  invest  a  minimum  of  $10  billion
by  2005  if  the  response  to  HIV/AIDS  is  to  have  an
impact.  Using  the  most  conservative  figures  of  the
number  of  persons  living  with  HIV/AIDS,  the  $10
billion  would barely  cover  $250  per  person  over  three
years:  much  less  than  $1  a  day  per  person.  Is  that  too
high a price to pay to protect human dignity? Is that too
much  to  restore  hope  and  dignity  to  the  millions  of
persons  affected  and  living  with  HIV/AIDS?  No,  it  is
not. But we are far from reaching even that target.
Important mechanisms such as the Global Fund to
Fight  AIDS,  Tuberculosis  and  Malaria  are  threatened
by the lack of resources. We call on all Governments to
honour  their  commitments  to  support  the  Global  Fund
and to adopt funding mechanisms such as an equitable
contributions  framework  based  on  a  county’s  gross
domestic  product  to  assure  stable  financing.  This  is
critical, because we know that the response to the crisis
must be sustained over many years to come.
It  is  also  important  to  understand  what  science
and  experience  have  taught  and  to  incorporate  it  into
this  fight.  It  is  a  clear  and  indisputable  fact  that  the
harm-reduction  approach  reduces  HIV  transmission.

In  December  2003,  the  International  Conference
of the Red Cross and Red Crescent  will bring together
Governments  and  the  Red  Cross  and  Red  Crescent  to
discuss  the  theme  of  protecting  human  dignity.  It  will
be  an  excellent  opportunity  for  all  Governments
represented  here  today,  as  well  as  the  Red  Cross  and
Red Crescent, to reaffirm their determined commitment
to support the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and
to  take  concrete  actions  against  the  indignity  that
ensues from it.
The  Acting  President: 
In  accordance  with
General  Assembly  resolution  48/265  of  24  August
1994,  I  now  call  on  His  Excellency  Mr.  José  Antonio
Linati-Bosch,  Chairman  of  the  observer  delegation  of
the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.
Mr.  Linati-Bosch  (Sovereign  Military  Order  of
Malta):  Allow  me  to  congratulate  Mr. Julian  Hunte  on
his election to the presidency of the General Assembly
at  its  fifty-eighth  session.  I  am  confident  that  his
efficiency  and  capacity  will  ensure  the  success  of  this
session.
It is  useless to  underline  the  importance  of  these
meetings. According to 2002 statistics, HIV/AIDS now
afflicts 40 million people, as compared to 37 million in
2001,  with  4.2  million  new  HIV  infections  per  year
worldwide. Those figures reveal the  perilous  nature of
the  disease.  It  has  been  estimated  that  by  2010,  there
will  be  at  least  60  million  and  as  many  as  80  to  110
million  people  with  AIDS.  In  2002,  8,500  people
worldwide died of AIDS each day; 1,600 were children
under 15 years of age. At the same time, 14,000 people
per day were newly infected. Of the 42  million people
affected, 95 per cent live in developing countries.
Although  public  education  programmes  have
been  implemented  and  medical  treatment  is  available,
the  foregoing  statistics  prove 
the  spread  of
HIV/AIDS is causing  a  global  catastrophe,  not limited
to so-called risk groups. In fact, we are facing what the
Secretary-General  has  called  “the  most  formidable

The European Commission has paid 120  million  euros
into  the  Global  Fund  and  has  allocated  an  additional

effective  and  sustainable  methods  of  cooperation,  so
that we can provide hope to those most in need.
