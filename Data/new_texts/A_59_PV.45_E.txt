Agenda item 15 (continued)
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs
(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic
and Social Council
Letter dated 25 August 2004 from the
Permanent Representative of Greece to the
United Nations addressed to the President of the
General Assembly (A/59/358)
The  President  (spoke 
in  French):  As  was
announced at the 43rd plenary meeting, on 27 October
2004, the General Assembly will first proceed to a by-
election to elect a member of the Economic and Social
Council,  in  accordance  with  rule  140  of  the  rules  of
procedure.
In that regard, I should like to draw the attention
of members to document A/59/358, containing a letter
dated  25  August  2004 
the  Permanent
Representative of Greece to the United Nations. In his
letter, 
the  Permanent  Representative  of  Greece
announces that Greece would like to relinquish its seat
on  the  Economic  and  Social  Council  during  2005  in
favour of Spain.
from 
As  a  result,  a  vacancy  will  occur  and  a  new
member must therefore be elected to fill the unexpired
term  of  office  of  Greece,  commencing  on  1  January
2005 and expiring on 31 December 2005.
In  accordance  with  paragraph  4  of  General
Assembly  resolution  2847  (XXVI),  of  20  December
1971,  and  taking  into  account  that  the  vacancy  will
occur from among the Group of Western European and
other  States,  the  new  member  should  therefore  be
elected from that region.
I  should  like  to  inform  the  members  of  the
General  Assembly  that  the  candidate  who  receives  a
two-thirds majority of members present and voting will
be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote, there will
be a special restricted ballot limited to those candidates
who have obtained an equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to
that procedure?
It was so decided.
The  President  (spoke  in  French):  In  accordance
with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall
be  held  by  secret  ballot,  and  there  shall  be  no
nominations.
Regarding  the  vacancy,  the  Chairman  of  the
Group  of  Western  European  and  other  States  for  the
month of August has informed the Secretariat that the
Group has endorsed Spain.
In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of
procedure,  we  shall  now  proceed  to  the  election  by
secret ballot.
I  should  like  to  inform  members  that,  as  of
1 January 2005, the following States from the Group of
Western European and other States will be represented

on 
the  Economic  and  Social  Council:  Belgium,
Canada,  France,  Germany,  Ireland,  Italy,  Turkey  and
the United States of America. The names of those eight
States should therefore not appear on the ballot.
Before we begin the voting process, I should like
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting.
We shall now begin the voting process.
Ballot  papers  will  now  be  distributed.  I  request
representatives  to  use  only  those  ballot  papers  and  to
write on them the name of the one State for which they
wish to vote. A ballot paper containing more than one
name  from  the  region  will  be  declared  invalid.  The
name of a Member State on a ballot paper that does not
belong to that region will not be counted at all.

I  congratulate  Spain,  which  has  been  elected  a
member of the Economic and Social Council.
The  General  Assembly  will  next  turn  to  the
election  of  18  members  of  the  Economic  and  Social
Council to replace those members whose term of office
expires  on  31  December  2004.  The  18  outgoing
members  are:  Australia,  Bhutan,  Burundi,  Chile,
China,  El  Salvador,  Finland,  Ghana,  Guatemala,
Hungary, India, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Qatar, the
Russian  Federation,  Sweden,  the  United  Kingdom  of
Great  Britain  and  Northern  Ireland,  Ukraine  and
Zimbabwe.  Members  will 
that  Greece
relinquished  its  seat  on  the  Economic  and  Social
Council,  effective  1  January  2005,  and  that  Spain  has
just been elected to fill that vacancy.
recall 
As of 1 January 2005, the following States will be
represented  on  the  Economic  and  Social  Council:
Armenia,  Azerbaijan,  Bangladesh,  Belgium,  Belize,
Benin,  Canada,  Colombia,  Congo,  Cuba,  Ecuador,
France,  Germany,  Indonesia,  Ireland,  Italy,  Jamaica,
Japan,  Kenya,  Malaysia,  Mauritius,  Mozambique,
Namibia,  Nicaragua,  Nigeria,  Panama,  Poland,  the
Republic  of  Korea,  Saudi  Arabia,  Senegal,  Spain,
Tunisia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United
the  United  States  of
Republic  of  Tanzania  and 
America.  The  names  of 
these  36  States  should
therefore not appear on the ballots.
In  accordance  with  paragraph  4  of  General
Assembly  resolution  2847  (XXVI)  of  20  December
1971, and taking into account the number of States that
will  remain  members  of  the  Council  after  1  January
2005,  the  18  members  should  be  elected  as  follows:
four  from  the  Group  of  African  States,  four  from  the
Group of Asian States, three from the Group of Eastern
European  States,  three  from  the  Group  of  Latin
American  and  Caribbean  States  and  four  from  the
Group  of  Western  European  and  other  States.  The
ballot papers reflect that pattern.
I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  those
candidates,  their  number  not  exceeding  the  number  of
seats  to  be  filled,  who  receive  the  greatest  number  of
votes  and  a  two-thirds  majority  of  members  present
and voting, will be declared elected. In the case of a tie
vote  for  a  remaining  seat,  there  will  be  a  special
restricted  ballot  limited  to  those  candidates  that  have
obtained an equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to
that procedure?
It was so decided.
The  President  (spoke  in  French):  In  accordance
with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall
be  held  by  secret  ballot  and  there  shall  be  no
nominations.
Ballot papers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E”
will now be distributed. I request representatives to use
only  those  ballot  papers  and  to  write  on  them  the
names of the States for which they wish to vote.

for the usual cooperation of representatives during the
voting.
I  should  also  like  to  remind  members  that  all
campaigning in the General Assembly Hall must cease
during the voting. That means, in particular, that once
the election has begun, no campaign materials may be
distributed  in  the  Hall.  All  representatives  are  also
asked to remain in their seats, in order that the voting
may take place in an orderly manner. I thank members
again for their cooperation.
We shall now begin the voting process.
A  ballot  paper  containing  more  names  from  the
relevant region than the number of seats assigned to it
will be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a
ballot  paper  that  do  not  belong  to  that  region  will  not
be counted at all.

Economic  and  Social  Council  for  a  three-year
term beginning 1 January 2005.
The  President  (spoke  in  French):  There  remain
two seats to be filled: one seat from among the Eastern
European  States  and  one  seat  from  among  the  Latin
American and Caribbean States.
We shall therefore proceed to a restricted ballot.
This second round of balloting shall be restricted
to  the  two  States  from  among  the  Eastern  European
States  that  were  not  elected  but  that  obtained  the
largest number of votes in the previous ballot, namely,
Albania  and  The 
former  Yugoslav  Republic  of
Macedonia,  as  well  as  to  the  two  States  from  among
the Latin American and Caribbean States that were not
elected but that obtained the largest number of votes in
the previous ballot, namely, Costa Rica and Venezuela.
That  is  in  accordance  with  rule  94  of  the  rules  of
procedure.
Before we begin the voting process, I should like
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting.
We shall now begin the voting process.
Ballot  papers  marked  “C”  and  “D”  will  now  be
distributed.
May  I  ask  representatives  to  write  on  the  ballot
papers the name of the one State for which they wish to
vote.  Ballot  papers  marked  “C”,  for  the  Eastern
European  States,  will  be  declared  invalid  if  they
contain the name of a State other than Albania or The
former  Yugoslav  Republic  of  Macedonia,  or  if  they
contain  the  names  of  more  than  one  State.  Ballot
papers  marked  “D”,  for  the  Latin  American  and
Caribbean  States,  will  be  declared  invalid  if  they
contain  the  name  of  a  State  other  than  Costa  Rica  or
Venezuela,  or  if  they  contain  the  names  of  more  than
one State.

This  restricted  ballot  has  been  inconclusive.
There  still  remain  two  seats  to  be  filled  —  one  from
among  the  Group  of  Eastern  European  States  and  one
from  among 
the  Group  of  Latin  American  and
Caribbean States.
In  accordance  with  the  rules  of  procedure,  we
should  continue  with  the  series  of  restricted  ballots.
However, in view of the lateness of the hour, I propose
that  we  postpone  further  balloting  until  tomorrow
morning, as the last item of the agenda.
It was so decided.
