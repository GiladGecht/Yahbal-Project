The  Acting  President: The  General  Assembly
will proceed to the election of 14 permanent judges of
the  International  Tribunal  for  the  Prosecution  of
Persons  Responsible 
for  Serious  Violations  of
International  Humanitarian  Law  Committed  in  the
Territory  of  the  Former  Yugoslavia  since  1991  for  a
four-year term of office commencing on 17 November
2005.
At  the  election  of  judges  in  2001,  14  permanent
judges  were  elected  for  a  term  of  four  years  that  will
expire on 16 November 2005.
In  connection  with  the  election  today  of  the  14
permanent judges, I should like to bring the following
matters to the attention of the General Assembly.
First, according to article 13 bis, paragraph 1, of
the statute of the International Tribunal as amended by
Security  Council  resolutions  1166  (1998)  of  13  May
1998  and  1329  (2000)  of  30  November  2000,  the  14
permanent judges of the International Tribunal shall be
elected  by  the  General  Assembly  from  a  list  of
candidates submitted by the Security Council.
At  its  5057th  meeting,  on  14  October  2004,  the
Security  Council,  in  accordance  with  article  13  bis,
subparagraph  1  (c)  of  the  statute  of  the  International
Tribunal, established in resolution 1567 (2004) a list of
22  candidates,  taking  due  account  of  the  adequate
representation  of  the  principal  legal  systems  of  the
world. The list was formally conveyed to the President
of the General Assembly  by  a  letter  dated  14  October
2004  from  the  President  of  the  Security  Council.  The
letter was issued as document A/59/437.
Secondly,  in  accordance  with  article  13  bis,
subparagraph  1  (d)  of  the  statute  of  the  International
Tribunal, 
the  Holy  See,  a  non-Member  State
maintaining  a  permanent  observer  mission  at  United
Nations  Headquarters,  shall  participate  in  the  election
in  the  same  manner  as  the  States  Members  of  the
United  Nations.  On  this  occasion,  I  am  happy  to
welcome here the representative of the Holy See.
Finally, I should like to draw the attention of the
Assembly  to  the  documents  relating  to  the  election.
This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of
speeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original
languages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature
of a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room
C-154A. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.

The memorandum by the Secretary-General concerning
the  election  of  judges  of  the  International  Tribunal  is
contained  in  document  A/59/438.  The  list  of  22
candidates  can  be  found  in  paragraph  7  of  the  same
document.
The  curricula  vitae  of  the  22  candidates  are
contained  in  document  A/59/439.  In  that  connection,
may  I  bring  to  the  Assembly’s  attention  the  provision
of article 13 of the statute of the International Tribunal,
which reads as follows:
in 
their 
law, 
respective  countries 
“The  permanent  and  ad  litem  judges  shall
be  persons  of  high  moral  character,  impartiality
and  integrity  who  possess  the  qualifications
required 
for
appointment to the highest judicial offices. In the
overall composition of the Chambers and sections
of the Trial Chambers, due account shall be taken
of  the  experience  of  the  judges  in  criminal  law,
international 
international
humanitarian law and human rights law.”
As  representatives  are  aware,  the  election  of
judges will take place in  accordance  with  the  relevant
provisions  of  article  13  bis  of  the  statute  of  the
International Tribunal.
including 
In addition, given the similar nature of the election
of judges of the International Court of Justice and  the
election of judges of the International Tribunal, it was
decided at the time of the elections of judges in 1993,
as  well  as  in  1997,  1998  and  2001,  to  follow  similar
election  procedures  in  the  General  Assembly.  In  his
memorandum, 
that
those precedents be applied to the election of judges of
the International Tribunal.
the  Secretary-General  suggests 
May  I  take  it  that  the  Assembly  agrees  to  that
suggestion?
It was so decided.
The Acting President: In accordance with article
13  bis,  subparagraph  1  (d)  of  the  statute  of  the
International  Tribunal,  the  candidates  who  receive  an
absolute majority of the votes of States Members of the
United  Nations  and  of  the  non-member  State  shall  be
declared elected. The consistent practice of the United
Nations  has  been  to  interpret  the  words  “absolute
majority”  as  meaning  a  majority  of  all  electors,
whether  or  not  they  vote  or  are  allowed  to  vote.  The
electors,  for  that  purpose,  are  all  191  Member  States
and one non-member State, the Holy See. Accordingly,
2
97 votes constitute an absolute majority for the purpose
of electing judges of the International Tribunal.
If,  in  the  first  ballot,  the  number  of  candidates
obtaining an absolute majority is less than 14, a second
ballot  will  be  held  and  balloting  will  continue  in  the
same  meeting  until  14  candidates  have  obtained  an
absolute majority.
Following the practice in the election of judges of
the  International  Court  of  Justice,  the  Secretary-
General  suggests  in  his  memorandum  that  any  second
and  subsequent  balloting  shall  be  unrestricted.  It  is
further  suggested  that,  following  the  practice  in  the
election  of  the  judges  of  the  International  Court  of
Justice,  if  more  than  14  candidates  obtain  an  absolute
majority of votes in the first ballot, a second ballot will
be held on all candidates and balloting will continue at
the  same  meeting  until  14  candidates,  and  no  more,
have obtained an absolute majority.
May  I  take  it  that  the  Assembly  agrees  to  the
procedures I have just outlined?
It was so decided.
The  Acting  President: I  now  call  on 
Observer of the Holy See.
the
Archbishop Migliore  (Holy See): The Holy  See

Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, since the

community  and  an  expression  of  its  condemnation  of
violations  of 
In
consideration of its  specific  nature  and  objectives,  the
Holy See, although invited to participate in the voting
process,  has  decided,  as  on  previous  occasions,  to

office  of  judge  of  the  International  Criminal  Tribunal
for the Former Yugoslavia.

At  the  same  time,  my  delegation  takes  this
opportunity to state its confidence in those selected by
this  process  and  wish  them  well  in  their  mission  to
apply  the  law  dispassionately,  thus  promoting  justice,
reconciliation  and  peace  among  the  peoples  who
comprise the former Yugoslavia.
The  Acting  President: Before  we  begin  the
voting process, I  should  like  to  remind  Members  that,
pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the  rules  of  procedure  of  the
General Assembly, no representative shall interrupt the
voting except on a point of order on the actual conduct
of the voting.
I  should  like  to  seek  the  usual  cooperation  of
representatives  during  the  time  of  the  conduct  of  the
election.  Please  be  reminded  that,  during  the  voting
process,  all  campaigning  should  cease  in  the  General
Assembly Hall. This means in particular that, once the
meeting has begun, no more campaign material can be
distributed inside the Hall. All representatives are also
requested  to  remain  at  their  seats  so  that  the  voting
process can proceed in an orderly manner. I thank them
for their cooperation.
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Ballot
papers will now be distributed.

the  14  candidates  for  whom  they  wish  to  vote  by

papers. Ballot papers on which more than 14 names are
marked  will  be  considered  invalid.  Votes  may  be  cast
only  for  those  whose  names  appear  on  the  ballot
papers.
At  the  invitation  of  the  President,  Mr.  Augustine

The  Acting  President: The  General  Assembly
will  now  proceed  to  the  third  round  of  unrestricted
balloting to fill the 14 vacancies.
Before proceeding further, I should like to recall
once again for delegations the following procedures for
the  election  of  the  judges,  as  was  stated  in  the
Secretary-General’s  memorandum 
in
document A/59/438.
contained 
If,  in  the  first  ballot,  the  number  of  candidates
obtaining an absolute majority is less than 14, a second
ballot  will  be  held,  and  balloting  will  continue  in  the
same  meeting  until  14  candidates,  and  no  more,  have
obtained an absolute majority.
Following the practice in the election of judges of
the  International  Court  of  Justice,  any  second  and
subsequent balloting shall be unrestricted.
If  more  than  14  candidates  obtain  an  absolute
majority of votes in the first ballot, a second ballot will
be held on all candidates, and balloting will continue at
the  same  meeting  until  14  candidates,  and  no  more,
have obtained an absolute majority.
A  number  of  representatives  have  asked  for  the
floor.
Mr. Elmessallati  (Libyan  Arab  Jamahiriya):
Allow  me,  first,  to  thank  all  the  representatives  who
have  supported  our  candidate  and  to  express  my
country’s gratitude to them.
Secondly,  in  view  of  the  results  of  the  previous
two rounds of balloting, I would like to announce that
we wish to withdraw our candidate from this election.
Mr.  Suazo  (Honduras)  (spoke  in  Spanish):  First
of all, allow me to thank all those delegations that have
supported  us  in  this  electoral  process,  which  has
proved  to  be  extremely  complex  in  view  of  the
circumstances established in the statute of the Tribunal.
I  am  grateful  for  the  information  provided  on
electoral  procedures  in  the  International  Court  of
Justice,  but  I  would  note  that  the  Court’s  electoral
process 
involves
simultaneous  voting  in  the  General  Assembly  and  the
Security  Council.  I  therefore  think  that  the  analogy
made  to  unrestricted  ballots  in  which  a  majority  of
votes  is  secured  by  certain  States  competing  in  the
rather  more  elaborate  and 
is 
process is not the soundest comparison. My delegation
would  draw  attention  to  the  need  to  review  the
electoral process set out in the Tribunal’s statute.
Finally, 
in  order 
to  secure  consensus  and
agreement  and  to  ensure  that  Latin  America  and  the
Caribbean  are  represented  by  our  candidates  Guyana
and Jamaica, Honduras withdraws its candidacy.
The  Acting  President: Members  have  heard  the
statements  just  made  that  Mr.  Elhagi  Abdulkader
Emberesh  of  the  Libyan  Arab  Jamahiriya  and  Mr.
Rigoberto  Espinal  Irias  of  Honduras  have  decided  to
withdraw  their  names  from  the  list  of  candidates
established by the Security Council. Accordingly, those
names will be struck from the ballot paper.
If  delegations  have  no  objection,  we  shall  now
proceed with the current round of balloting, taking into
account the statements just made by the representatives
of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Honduras.
The names of the candidates just withdrawn will
therefore  be  removed  from  the  next  ballot.  For  this
balloting, I would like to request members to strike out
the names of the candidates who have just withdrawn,
namely,  Mr.  Elhagi  Abdulkader  Emberesh  of  the
Libyan  Arab  Jamahiriya  and  Mr.  Rigoberto  Espinal
Irias of Honduras.
We shall now continue with the balloting.
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Ballot
papers will now be distributed.

obtained an absolute majority.
In accordance with the decision taken earlier, the
Assembly will proceed to another unrestricted ballot to
fill the 14 vacancies.
A  number  of  representatives  have  asked  to  take
the floor.
Mr.  Matondo  Mamuamda 
(Democratic
Republic  of  the  Congo)  (spoke  in  French):  The
Democratic Republic of the Congo wishes to extend its
warm  thanks  to  the  representatives  of  brotherly  and
friendly countries that voted for our national candidate.
However, given the results of the first, second and third
rounds  of  balloting,  the  Democratic  Republic  of  the
5
A/59/PV.57
Congo  has  decided  to  withdraw  the  candidacy  of  the
person in question.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo wishes to
assure  our  friends  and  brothers  here  whose  nationals
remain candidates for positions on the Tribunal that its
withdrawal  will  have  absolutely  no  impact  on  its
arrangements or other agreements of principle relating
to these circumstances.
Mr.  Musambachime  (Zambia):  My  delegation
would  like  to  thank  all  the  member  States  that  have
supported  our  candidature  up  to  this  point,  but  our
delegation feels that we should withdraw our candidate,
Mrs. Nyambe. In so doing, we want to assure all those
that have supported us of our gratitude and thanks.
Mr.  Dhakal  (Nepal):  First  of  all,  my  delegation
would  like  to  express  its  sincere  gratitude  to  all  those
delegations  that  have  kindly  extended  their  support  to
the candidate of Nepal, Mr. Mr. Sharada Prasad Pandit,
Supreme  Court  justice  of  Nepal.  However,  in  view  of
the  trend  or  pattern  of  voting  in  the  three  rounds  of
balloting,  my  delegation  would  like  to  inform  all
delegations here that we wish to withdraw Mr. Pandit’s
candidature.
Mr. 
Andrianarivelo-Razafy 
(Madagascar)
(spoke  in  French):  On  behalf  of  the  delegation  of
Madagascar, and in particular of our candidate, I wish
very  warmly  to  thank  all  those  delegations  that  have
been  kind  enough  to  support  Madagascar’s  candidate.
Given  the  number  of  votes  that  she  has  received,
however, we wish to inform the Assembly that we are
withdrawing 
the  candidacy  of  Ms.  Vonimbolana
Rasoazanany  and  wish  every  success

remaining in the race.

The  Acting  President: Members  have  heard  the
statements  that  Mr.  Yenyi  Olungu  of  the  Democratic
Republic  of  the  Congo,  Mr.  Sharada  Prasad  Pandit  of
Nepal,  Ms.  Vonimbolana  Rasoazanany  of  Madagascar
and Ms. Prisca Matimba Nyambe of Zambia have decided
to  withdraw  their  names  from  the  list  of  candidates
established by the Security Council. Accordingly, those
names will be struck from the ballot paper.
In  view  of  the  fact  that  new  ballots  have  to  be
prepared to take into account the withdrawals that have
just  been  announced,  I  would  suggest 
the
Assembly suspend its meeting at this point and that we

Statement on the occasion of Africa Industrialization
Day
The Acting  President: I  would  like  to  remind the
General Assembly that tomorrow, Saturday, 20 November
2004, is Africa Industrialization Day.
I will now deliver the message of the President of
the  General  Assembly  on  the  occasion  of  Africa
Industrialization Day.
“On  20  November,  the  United  Nations
family observes Africa Industrialization Day with
the  collective  spirit  of  supporting  and  promoting
the  sustainable  industrial  development  efforts  of
the  continent.  The  theme  for  this  year’s  Africa

‘Strengthening

particularly  the  halving  of  income  poverty,  the
African  economies  must  grow.  The  estimates
show  that  annual  gross  domestic  product  per
capita growth rates of 2 to 6 per cent are required
to  meet  that  Goal.  In  that  context,  productivity
enhancement plays a leading role.
“As  a  key  component  of  productivity,
successful industrialization is the motive force for
applying  new  technologies  and  entrepreneurship

environment  for  human  capital  development,

In  2005,  the  entire  world  will  celebrate  the
sixtieth  anniversary  of  the  victory  over  fascism.  The
great triumph of the Second World War was the result
of  the  joint  efforts  of  the  peoples  of  many  countries
and  was  the  primary  impulse  leading  the  international
community  to  establish  the  United  Nations.  Through
the suffering and death of millions, the peoples  of the
world have come to see the irreplaceable nature of the
international  security  system  that  the  United  Nations
embodies in the maintenance of international peace.
to  achieve 
Today, it is important to recall the lessons of the
Second World War and the memory of those who died in
it, and to unite the efforts of the international community,
through the central role of the United Nations, to face the
new threats and challenges emerging  in  the  world.  The
Member  States  must  come  together  to  address  new
challenges, 
the  pacific  settlement  of
disputes,  to  deal  with  conflicts  in  the  future  and  to
strengthen the maintenance of stable and lasting peace.
In  the  general  interests  of  humankind,  we  will
need to further strengthen the role and efficiency of the
United  Nations  as  a  central  element  in  the  system  of
collective  security  in  order  to  implement  the  widely
hailed  objectives  of  the  Charter  and  to  save  peoples
from the scourge of war.
Today,  the  General  Assembly  is  considering  the
draft  resolution  on  the  declaration  by  the  United
Nations  of  8  and  9  May  as  days  of  remembrance  and
reconciliation,  contained  in  document  A/59/L.28/Rev.1.
We believe that the General Assembly will support that
important collective and universal initiative and help to
mobilize  efforts  to  maintain  a  secure  and  equitable
world  order  in  accordance  with  the  United  Nations
Charter.  The  General  Assembly  will  hold  a  special
solemn meeting on 9 May 2005 in  commemoration  of
the  sacrifices  made  during  the  war,  at  which  a
declaration will be made to encourage general progress
and the avoidance of new wars.
We hope that the draft resolution will be adopted
without  a  vote.  Bearing  in  mind  the  fact  that  certain
delegations  have  asked  for  more  time  to  work  on  the
draft, we suggest that the  adoption  of  a  decision  on  it
be postponed until Monday, 22 November.
war brought unspeakable suffering. It affected the lives
of millions of people in Europe and beyond. It changed
the fates of individuals, families and whole nations.
Rightfully,  reflection  on 
that  suffering  and
commemoration  of  the  end  of  that  period  of  extreme
horrors are our common duty. It should inspire us — as
individuals,  as  nations,  as  organizations  —  to  do
everything  in  our  power  to  jointly  prevent  war  and
violence  and  to  deal  in  a  peaceful  manner  with  the
challenges and threats we are facing.
