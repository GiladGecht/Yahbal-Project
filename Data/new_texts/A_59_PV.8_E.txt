Address by Mr. Henrique Pereira Rosa, President of
the Republic of Guinea-Bissau
The President (spoke in French): The Assembly
will  now  hear  an  address  by  the  President  of  the
Republic of Guinea-Bissau.
Mr.  Henrique  Pereira  Rosa,  President  of  the
Republic of Guinea-Bissau, was escorted into the
General Assembly Hall.
The  President  (spoke  in  French):  On  behalf  of
the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to
the  United  Nations  His  Excellency  Mr.  Henrique
Pereira  Rosa,  President  of  the  Republic  of  Guinea-
Bissau, and to invite him to address the Assembly.

President  Pereira  Rosa  (spoke  in  Portuguese;
interpretation 
the
delegation):  Thirty  years  ago,  my  country  attained  its
national  sovereignty.  Indeed,  it  was  on  17  September
1974  that  the  young  Republic  of  Guinea-Bissau  was
admitted  to  the  United  Nations  as  a  full-fledged
Member  State.  Three  decades,  to  be  sure,  is  a  short
time in terms of nation-building. But it is a long time if
you consider that in most African countries, including
my  own,  life  expectancy  does  not  exceed  50  years.
That  bitter  reality  is  the  true  measure  of  the  time  that
has elapsed and of what my country has achieved since
independence.  Hence,  for  us  in  Guinea-Bissau,  this  is
an 
for
reflection, 
important 
time 
for 
indeed 
introspection,  in  the  light  of  recent  events  and  of  the
successive crises we have confronted of late.
I  address  the  Assembly  today  as  the  transitional
President  of 
the  Republic  of  Guinea-Bissau.
Addressing the Assembly gives me particular pleasure,
Sir,  because  you  (cid:151)  Mr.  Jean  Ping,  the  outstanding
Minister  of  State  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs  of
the  brotherly  and  friendly  Gabonese  Republic  (cid:151)  are
presiding  over  the  Assembly(cid:146)s  work  with  the  skill,
experience and talent we all know so well.
We  have  come  to  New  York  in  search  of  new
ideas for innovative and resolute action, ideas that will
affect the way we think and will have a positive impact
on  our  joint  efforts  to  create  a  new  world  of  peace,
freedom and social justice for all countries and peoples
represented here.
It  was  with  great  attention  and  interest  that  we
listened  to  the  outstanding  statement  made  here  two
days  ago  by  Secretary-General  Kofi  Annan  (see
A/59/PV.3). His  observations  were  thought-provoking.
For  our  part,  we  share  his  vision  of  the  world  as  it  is
today  and  as  it  should  be  tomorrow.  Above  all,  we
appreciate his dedication and determination at the head
of

We  live  today  in  a  world  of  ever  more  striking
contrasts,  imbalances,  contradictions  and  inequalities.
On  the  one  hand,  we  are  witness  to  increasingly
marvellous scientific  and technological progress,  from
which  certain  countries  benefit  greatly.  On  the  other

hand,  hundreds  of  millions  of  people  continue  to  live
precarious  lives  and  to  suffer  from  malnutrition  and
endemic  disease.  This  situation  is  not  only  inhuman
and immoral, it is dangerous. It is sowing all the seeds
that  provoke  frustration  and  despair,  fuel  rancour  and
hatred  and  lead  to  irrational  behaviour  and  to  actions
endangering peace and international security.
Combating  poverty  and  epidemics 
such  as
HIV/AIDS throughout the world does not mean kindness
or charity; it is common sense that requires that together
we mobilize our actions to combat those scourges. I am
gratified by the initiative of certain heads of State (cid:151) in
particular,  President  Lula  da  Silva  (cid:151)  in  recalling  to
each of us our responsibilities in the fight to eradicate
hunger and destitution in a world as interdependent as
the  one  in  which  we  live  today.  It  is  critical  here  to
understand  that  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  act,  and  to
act properly. Above all, let us not wait for more reports
or  analyses  to  be  submitted  to  us  first,  regardless  of
how  visionary  or  relevant  they  may  be.  Thousands  of
women,  children  and  infants  die  every  day  because
they lack a pill or a vaccination. That is unjust; that is
immoral.
We  must  pool  our  efforts  to  establish  more
equitable  relations  among  States.  International  trade
must  be  better  regulated,  just  as  globalization  and  its
effects  on 
the  world  economy  must  be  better
controlled, to allow for a more equitable distribution of
the  riches  of  the  world.  Rather  than  leaving  the
underdeveloped countries to suffer  from  the  effects  of
globalization,  let  us  create  for  them  the  conditions
necessary  for  their  integration  into  the  process,  which
is  utterly  beyond  their  control  and  whose  social
dimension must be the subject of specific measures so
as to mitigate negative consequences.
Today it is clear to everyone that to ensure peace
throughout  the  world  there  is  a  need  to  promote  the
development  of  the  poorest  countries  and  to  improve
the  living  conditions  of  populations,  in  particular  by
guaranteeing them access to drinking water, health and
education  (cid:151)  especially  for  girls.  Above  all  there  is  a
need to create a social and political environment that is
stable  and  is  likely  to  release  that  creative  energy  of

to  promote 
The  rights  of  each  and  every  person  must  be

guaranteed  without  any  impediment.  The  rule  of  law
must  be  consolidated  to  allow  each  institution  to
function  properly  and  effectively.  I  am  thinking  in
particular of justice, which must be able to act with full
independence  and  with  scrupulous  respect  for  the
separation of executive, legislative and judicial powers.
Guinea-Bissau,  unfortunately,  has  not  escaped
from  the  cycle  of  violence  and  political  crisis  that
seems  today  to  have  become  a  prerogative  of  the
African  countries.  Our  country  has  recently  suffered
from  the  disastrous  consequences  of  an  economic
policy  that  is  poorly  adapted  to  the  real  needs  of  the
population.  The  domestic  conflict  we  have  been
experiencing  in  Guinea-Bissau  since  1998  could  have
been  avoided.  It  has  further  impoverished  a  country
that is among the least developed countries and where
everything  must  still  be  built  because  nothing  could
resist  destruction.  We  are  aware  of  the  seriousness  of
the situation and of the need to pool our efforts to make
the necessary changes, which our people have a right to
expect from their leaders.
Our  people  have  suffered  too  much  and  for  too
long  and  have  made  too  many  sacrifices.  We  must
create  new  conditions  that  provide  reasons  for  hope.
We have successfully initiated national dialogue based
on mutual respect and taking into account the national
interest. We have created a new culture of peace based
on  our  affiliation  with  one  single  country  with  all  its
diversity  and  social  and  cultural  riches.  We  have
decided to make democracy an immutable reality.
However,  we  are  aware  that  democracy  is  not
easy to build in a poor country where the illiteracy rate
is still high and where the fundamental infrastructure is
still severely lacking. Nevertheless, we  continue  to  be
inspired  by  the  courage  of  our  people  and  by  the
support  of  other  countries  (cid:151)  those  of  the  Economic
Community  of  West  African  States  (ECOWAS),  the
Union  (cid:201)conomique  et  Mon√òtaire  Ouest-africaine
(UEMOA) and the Community of Portuguese-speaking
Countries  in  particular  (cid:151)  and  the  European  Union,
China  and  the  rest  of  the  international  community.
Thus  last  March  we  were  able  to  organize  legislative
elections  that  the  international  community  considered
just and credible and to establish a new parliament, the
role  of  which  is  fundamental  in  any  democracy.  We
will  also  be  organizing  presidential  elections  in  April
2005,  as  agreed  in  the  Charter  of  Transition,  thus
allowing for the restoration of constitutional order.
the  assistance  of 
Guinea-Bissau  needs 
the
international  community  to  meet  the  many  enormous
challenges confronting it. That assistance is urgent and
important.  We  have  created  mechanisms  for 
the
rigorous  control  of  State  revenues  and  expenditures
and, with the  assistance  of  the  UNDP  and  the  Bretton
Woods  institutions  in  particular,  all  the  necessary
conditions  for  the  transparent  management  of  public
property, which allows us to combat corruption.
To enable us to relaunch our economy rapidly, we
are  planning  to  hold  a  round  table  in  December.  We
hope  that  India,  Brazil  and  South  Africa  will  be
assisting  us  in  that  initiative  to  combat  poverty  and
helping  us  in  the  organization  we  have  created  in  our
country.
We  have  here  a  great  opportunity  to  express  our
gratitude  for  the  commitment  and  dynamic  action  of
the  Economic  and  Social  Council(cid:146)s  Ad  Hoc  Advisory
Group  on  Guinea-Bissau  and 
its  partners,  an
indispensable  instrument  for  advancing  constructive
dialogue  between  Guinea-Bissau  and  its  partners  for
development, 
the
International  Monetary  Fund.  I  should  like  to  thank
them from this rostrum for their continued support. So,
too, we wish to reaffirm our great appreciation for the
members  of  the  Security  Council  who  visited  our
country last June and showed their great interest in it.

that the Security Council(cid:146)s part will be strengthened by
enhancing  its  membership  to  better  reflect  the  world
situation.  From  this  rostrum,  I  would  like  to  say  how
grateful  we  are  to  those  who  supported  us  in  the  first

not  hope  to  grow  up  in  a  home  where  peace  and  love

guarantee  the  rights  of  women  and  give  a  suitable
education  to  young  women?  How  can  we  prevent  the

becoming victims of an endemic illness such as AIDS,
tuberculosis  or  malaria  at  a  time  when  most  poor
countries are incapable of providing basic health care?
Tomorrow(cid:146)s world is being built today. Thanks to
the  awareness  of  the  real  challenges,  in  this  planetary
village in which we all live, with its advantages and its
problems,  our  human  condition  must  be  the  common
denominator on which and around which all people of
good  will  should  come  together  in  order  to  make  our
world  more  fair,  more  tolerant  and  based  more  on
solidarity.
Whether we  are discussing crises  in  Africa  or  in
the  Middle  East,  or  the  fight  against  terrorism  (cid:151)  a
fight that requires us all to mobilize our efforts  (cid:151) we
must  be  animated  by  the  same  determination  to  seek
lasting solutions based on consensus.
The  peoples  we  represent  expect  us  to  take
concrete  actions.  They  hope  that  we  will  be  able  to
overcome our differences and pool our efforts so as to
respond to their most urgent needs. Many praiseworthy
initiatives  to  eradicate  hunger,  poverty,  malnutrition
and  illiteracy  have  been  undertaken.  We  must  involve
non-governmental organizations and other elements of
civil  society.  In  other  words,  we  must  appeal  to  all
people of goodwill.
The  nations  of  the  world  all  share  the  planet
Earth,  on  which  we  all  live.  It  is  our  responsibility  to
protect it so that  we  can  provide  our  children  and  our
children(cid:146)s  children  with  the  conditions  for  a  healthy
life lived in dignity.
Environmental  protection  alone  is  not  enough.
We must also create a climate of peace throughout the
world.  That  cannot  be  done  without  the  help  of  each
Member  State:  it  must  be  a  collective  effort  in  which
dialogue and agreement take precedence and where the
rule of law prevails in international relations. None of
our  peoples  can  live  in  isolation  in  the  self-reliant
manner of the past. The interdependence of the global
economy  is  now  a  reality  for  all  of  us.  Let  us  take
advantage  of  the  resources  of  the  Earth  without
abusing  our  ecosystems,  because  the  future  of  the
planet depends on our capacity to think in terms of the
collective  interest.  Let  us  act  in  a  spirit  of  humanism
and  solidarity  whenever  the  poorest  of  the  poor
confront  calamity  and  natural  disasters  (cid:151)  disasters
such  as  those  that  have  recently  afflicted  Haiti,  the
Dominican Republic and other Caribbean countries.

Let  us  understand 
true  dimension  and
meaning  of  the  spiritual  force  that  resides  in  each

of doubt and discouragement in order to regain the will
and the energy we need to overcome our challenges.

the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of
the Republic of Guinea-Bissau for the statement he has

The President (spoke in French): The Assembly
will  now  hear  an  address  by  the  President  of  the
Republic of the Gambia.
Al Hadji Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh, President of the
Republic  of  the  Gambia,  was  escorted  into  the
General Assembly Hall.
The  President  (spoke  in  French):  On  behalf  of
the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to
the United Nations His Excellency Al Hadji Yahya A.
J. J. Jammeh, President of the Republic of the Gambia,
and to invite him to address the Assembly.
like,  Sir, 
President  Jammeh: I  should 
to
congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency
of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. This
session  might  well  prove  to  be  epoch-making  in  that
this body will be called upon to consider and to make
far-reaching  decisions  on  what  ought  to  be  done  to
revitalize  our  Organization  and  to  better  align  it  to  fit
today(cid:146)s  imperatives  for  global  security,  peace  and
development. I have no doubt that you will  live  up  to
our expectations and that, given your wisdom and vast
experience,  you  will  guide  our  deliberations 
to  a
successful outcome. You may rest assured, Mr. President,
that you will receive my delegation(cid:146)s fullest cooperation.
I  would  also  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  pay
tribute  to  your  predecessor,  the  very  energetic  and
dynamic outgoing President, Mr. Julian E. Hunte, who
conducted the business of the fifty-eighth session with
gusto,  dedication  and  courage,  and  who  helped  us  to
address  some  difficult  issues.  My  delegation  wishes
him all the very best in his future endeavours.

To  our  Secretary-General,  Mr.  Kofi  Annan,  I
express  my  deep  appreciation  for  yet  another  year  of
dedicated  service  to  the  Organization  (cid:151)  indeed,  to
humanity at large. Some of the problems that were laid
before  him  were  not  easy  to  resolve  but,  as  expected,
resolved they were. I hope that his efforts to ensure the
triumph  of  multilateralism,  the  resolution  of  disputes
and  the  pursuit  of  meaningful  cooperation  among
nations will be further bolstered during the session that
is just beginning.
I stand here representing the young people of the
world.  My  statement  is  very  long,  and  is  divided  into
two  parts:  one  part  will  be 
to
representatives; I will read out the other part.
circulated 
World leaders have stood at this rostrum on many
occasions,  addressing  the  world.  We  made  pledges  to
the  children  of  the  world  during  the  twenty-seventh
special  session  (cid:151)  the  children(cid:146)s  summit  (cid:151)  in  2002.
During  that  special  session,  we  pledged  to  create  a
better  world  and  an  environment  conducive  to  the
wellbeing  of  the  children  of  the  world.  We  have  also
come up with objectives for global development so as
to make the world a better place for humanity by 2015.
So far, there is no indication that those objectives will
be achieved in the next 2,000 years.
What  are  the  problems?  Since  the  children(cid:146)s
summit  took  place,  we  have  seen  the  condition  of  the
world(cid:146)s  children  become  more  and  more  desperate.
Children  are  being  butchered  throughout  the  world.
Children(cid:146)s rights are being violated. Children are being
sold  into  slavery,  and  they  are  being  terrorized  by
adults (cid:151) we, who are supposed to take care of them.
We  have  seen  the  economies  of  small  States
collapse as a result of rising oil prices. I come from a
volatile  part  of  the  world,  but  I  do  not  represent  only
Africa; I represent the young people of the world, whose
future is very bleak if the status quo is not addressed.
What are the problems of humanity today? They
are  man-made  problems,  and,  because  they  are  man-
made, we will be able to resolve them. The solution to
those  problems 
lies  with  us,  human  beings  (cid:151)
irrespective of race, colour, creed or religion.
The  problem  of  development  can  best  be
summarized thus: as long as there is violence and as long
as there is no peace or  global  security,  we,  the  poorer
parts of humanity, will always become poorer and poorer,
while the richer nations will become richer and richer.
There  cannot  be  any  development  without  peace
and stability. There cannot be peace or stability without
democracy,  justice  and  equality.  The  main  problem  of
humanity  today  (cid:151)  which  is  creating  all  our  other
problems  (cid:151)  is  a  result  of  four  human  tendencies:
greed, double standards, intolerance and hypocrisy.
None  of  us  here  can  look  into  the  faces  of  our
children and assure them of a bright future or of their
safety. Because of greed, human life has been reduced
to  naught.  People  want  to  become  rich  at  the  expense
of  human  life.  Greed  can  come  in  many  forms.  The
insatiable 
and
intolerance (cid:151) those are things that face humanity today.
for  world 
appetite 
domination 
Our problem is not a confrontation between Islam
and  other  religions.  The  problem  of  terrorism  is  a
human  characteristic.  No  good  Muslim  would  ever
commit  a  terrorist  act.  But,  because  the  world  has
become so bad, lawlessness is rampant, and those who
want  to  take  out  their  frustrations  on  other  human
beings  can  do  so  in  the  name  of  Islam  or  any  other
religion.
I have listened to my colleagues who have spoken
here.  But,  as  long  as  certain  issues  are  not  addressed,
there will be no peace, and the war against terror will
become an elusive fight that we will always lose.
Some of us believe that, because we disapproved
of  the  war  in  Iraq  in  the  beginning,  it  is  not  our
business  to  help  solve  it  now.  But  let  me  assure  the
Assembly  that  the  war  in  Iraq  has  more  far-reaching
consequences for humanity (cid:151) and particularly for the
children  whom  we  pledged  to  support  at  the  World
Summit  for  Children  (cid:151)  than  for  anything  else.  We
have  seen  our  economies  collapse  because  of  high  oil
prices  that  rise  higher  every  day.  It  is  our  collective
responsibility to put an end to the war in Iraq. We have
seen  the  rise  of  global  terrorism;  the  world  is  a  more
dangerous  place  today  than  during  the  cold  war.  The
war  in  Iraq  (cid:151)  regardless  of  whether  or  not  we
supported it (cid:151) is a human tragedy, and it is not in our
interests,  as  the  human  race,  to  let  that  war  continue
because  we  disapprove  of  what  has  happened.  Two
wrongs  cannot  make  a  right.  Even  if  we  believe  that
the war was wrong, it is the responsibility of the entire
human  race  to  help  put  an  end  to  the  suffering  of  the
Iraqi people. We have seen children being butchered in
Beslan,  Russia;  we  have  seen  Palestinian  and  Israeli
children  being  butchered.  The  problem  is  not  a
religious  problem  but  a  political  one,  because  we,  the
A/59/PV.8
leaders  of  the  world,  want  to  teach  others  a  lesson  by
making them suffer. That is a human tragedy.
We cannot be diplomats here if we want to solve
the world(cid:146)s problems. It is amazing that, when certain
actions  that  are  described  as  terrorist  acts  are  carried
out  by  other  parties,  they  are  described  as  retaliation
for  something.  An  unlawful  act  that  destroys  human
life  is  a  terrorist  act,  regardless  of  its  objective  or  the
rationale behind it.
If  poverty 
there  will  be
desperation  and  hunger.  And,  if  human  beings  are
desperate, they can resort to actions that are horrific to
the  rest  of  us.  We  have  seen  that  some  parts  of  the
world  are  very  rich  and  that  other  parts  (cid:151)  including
Africa, where I come from (cid:151) are becoming poorer and
poorer. If the world(cid:146)s wealth is not distributed equally,
there will be imbalances and inequities, and there will
be  people  who  are  desperate.  If  people  are  desperate,
they will do anything to survive.
is  not  addressed, 
However, that does not mean that one can justify
violence. I do not justify violence in any form, because
I believe that peace and stability would augur well for
our  children.  The  fight  against  terror  is  global.  Let  us
be mindful of the consequences of allowing terror to be
seen as a legitimate act.
We  have  seen  double  standards  being  applied
when resolutions are adopted for the good of humanity
by the international community (cid:151) which is represented
here  (cid:151)  and,  in  some  cases,  are  enforced  to  the  letter,
whereas  a  few  States  are  above  international  law  and
United Nations resolutions.
That  brings  me  to  the  issue  of  nuclear  weapons.
As a human being and as a peacemaker, I believe that,
following  the  end  of  the  cold  war,  no  nation  should
have  been  able  to  justify  the  possession  of  nuclear
weapons,  much  less  become  a  new  nuclear  Power.  If
powerful  nations  continue 
their  nuclear
weapons (cid:151) and there are many double standards in the
way we deal with one another (cid:151) that will only become
an  enticement  for  others  to  opt  for  nuclear  weapons
because  they  think  such  weapons  will  serve  as  an
insurance policy against attacks.
to  keep 
I  know  that,  during  the  1980s,  there  was  a
campaign  to  promote  nuclear  disarmament.  Today,  in
the  new  millennium, 
that  campaign  should  be
strengthened  through  a  United  Nations  resolution
making 
to  possess  nuclear

weapons.  We  have  seen  conflicts  simmering  that  will
have  drastic  consequences  for  humanity  (cid:151)  conflicts
aimed  at  preventing  certain  States  from  acquiring
nuclear weapons. Now that the Soviet empire no longer
exists,  all  nuclear  weapons  (cid:151)  whether  they  are
possessed  by  the  Gambia  or  by  any  other  country  (cid:151)
should  be  eliminated.  Just  imagine  one  bomb  killing
millions of people. And here we stand, telling everyone
that the world will be a better place for mankind. I believe
in the peaceful resolution of all conflicts. Indeed,  as  far
as  I  know,  there  is  no  licensing  authority  for  the
possession  of  nuclear  weapons;  therefore,  no  one  can
decide who should and who should not have them.
We should take a bold step to ensure that no one
has  nuclear  weapons.  In  this  forum,  on  behalf  of  the
world(cid:146)s  children,  I  appeal  to  those  who  aspire  to
possess nuclear weapons that that is the wrong path to
take. Peace and stability cannot be ensured through the
possession  of  nuclear  weapons.  The  strength  of  a
nation  is  not  based  on  its  firepower  or  its  nuclear
arsenal,  but  is  determined  by  its  ability  to  make  the

Address by Mr. Ricardo Maduro Joest, President of
the Republic of Honduras
The President (spoke in French): The Assembly
will  now  hear  an  address  by  the  President  of  the
Republic of Honduras.
Mr.  Ricardo  Maduro  Joest,  President  of  the
Republic  of  Honduras,  was  escorted  into  the
General Assembly Hall.
The  President  (spoke  in  French):  On  behalf  of
the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to
the  United  Nations  His  Excellency  Mr.  Ricardo
Maduro  Joest,  President  of  the  Republic  of  Honduras,
and to invite him to address the Assembly.
President Maduro Joest (spoke in Spanish): For
the  second  time,  I  have  this  special  opportunity  of
appearing  before  you  in  the  common  home  of  the
6
nations of the world. Everyone knows that we live in a
time  of  great  risks  and  problems,  but  also  of  great
opportunities.  Allow  me  to  refer  to  two  challenges,
which  in  my  opinion  are  the  most  important:  the  lack
of security and the existence of poverty.
First of all, I must refer to the lack of security. I
believe that it is obvious to everyone that the durability
of our democratic system and the alleviation of poverty
require us to provide for the security of each one of our
citizens.  My  Government  is  committed  to  that.  The
safety  of  my  compatriots  is  my  first  priority.  I  am
committed  to  ensuring  respect  for  human  rights  and,
within  that  concept,  I  am  even  more  committed  to
ensuring the protection and the security  of  honest  and
hard-working  citizens.  If  we  all  strive  to  provide
security  and  reduce  our  citizens(cid:146)  level  of  poverty,  we
will  also  be  combating  terrorists,  and  we  will  be
winning the battle against those who take advantage of
the  positive  qualities  of  democracy  to  destroy  it
through terror.
Combating  terrorism  begins  by  combating  crime
and delinquency in our countries. We are committed to
this struggle, and we know that we are not alone. This
is, in fact, a universal challenge. We know that we can
only confront it if we are together. Crime, delinquency
and  terrorism  have,  in  effect,  already  undergone
globalization  and  our  actions,  therefore,  must  be
equally based on international cooperation.
Organized  crime  appears  in  many  shapes  and
forms.  However,  few  are  as  degrading  as  drug
trafficking. Few crimes generate as much corruption or
so  thoroughly  destroy  the  core  of  our  society  and  our
values than drug trafficking. My country is on the drug
trafficking  route.  We  are  right  in  the  middle  of  the
corridor that links the producers to the consumers. We
are  victims  of  the  greed  of  the  producers  and  the
perverted  desires  of  the  consumers.  Over  the  past  18
months  in  Honduras,  we  have  impounded  more  drugs
than in all the previous nine years, but this is obviously
still not enough. Combating organized crime and drug
trafficking, if we are alone, will be almost impossible.
The  Governments  of  the  countries  in  which  drugs  are
produced,  the  countries  that  are  used  to  transport  the
drugs  and  the  countries  in  which  the  drugs  are
consumed  must,  together,  confront  this.  If  we  are
alone,  the  poor  countries  have  very  few  chances  of
succeeding. If we remain alone, we will have to divert
resources  that  we  need  to  combat  poverty  towards
combating  drug  trafficking  and  organized  crime.  We
A/59/PV.8
need more resolute, direct and substantial support if we
are to confront this tremendous challenge. I would like
to say to the wealthy countries: let us work together to
confront this scourge of our time.
Security also implies the rule of law and, for over
three years, we have worked to bring it about. We have
combated  corruption  by  closing  businesses 
that
engaged  in  tax  evasion,  eliminated  the  immunity  of
public servants and promoted a responsible use of State
resources.  We  have  achieved  a  great  deal,  but  we
recognize  that  a  great  deal  remains  to  be  done.  We
recently  adopted  a  property  law,  which,  for  the  first
time  in  our  history,  enables  the  poor  to  hold  deeds  to
their land. This may seem simple and almost trivial in
developed  countries,  but  on  our  continent,  by  and
large,  the  poor  have  not  enjoyed  the  benefit  of  these
valuable  deeds.  Eighty-four  per  cent  of  Honduras(cid:146)
citizens do not have a title to the plot of land on which
they  live.  We  are  opening  new  pathways,  and  before
my  Government  completes  its  mandate,  we  hope  that
hundreds of thousands of poor people will hold, for the
first time, registered titles to their property.
Security  also  implies  peaceful  relationships  with
our  neighbours.  For  the  first  time  in  our  history,  our
land  borders  have  been  defined,  and  they  are  now
being  conclusively  demarcated.  What  is  even  more
important  is  that  this  was  achieved  without  spilling
blood and without bellicose threats. We resorted to the
International  Court  of  Justice  in  The  Hague  and  we
have  complied  with  its  rulings.  As  far  as  Honduras  is
concerned,  solving  a  border  dispute  is  not  something
that can be achieved through violence. It can be achieved
peacefully, through international jurisprudence.
Having  now  consolidated  our  land  borders,  we
are  defining  our  maritime  borders,  and  we  have  once
again had recourse to the International Court of Justice.
In our opinion, the time has now come to take the
next step. The time has come to declare Central America
a  zone  of  peace,  a  zone  that  renounces  violence  as  a
means  of  resolving  disputes.  To  consolidate 
this
process  with  the  support  of  the  Organization  of
American  States,  we  have  already  eliminated  all  the
landmines  that  were  placed  around  our  country  years
ago,  and  we  can  now  say  with  pride  that  we  are  a
country that is entirely free of landmines. To bring this
process  to  completion,  we  now  propose  reducing  the
number  of  weapons  of  war  throughout  the  region.  To
lend  credibility  to  this  process,  we  invite  the  United
Nations to accompany us and to certify compliance on
the  part  of  each  of  our  countries.  We  also  invite  the
international community to join us in this process.
We propose that the process of arms reduction be
supported  with  fresh  resources  to  combat  poverty.  We
propose an exchange: weapons of war in exchange for
funding  for  poverty  alleviation.  Please  support  us.
Poverty,  and  even  more,  hunger  and  malnutrition,  are
the most fearsome enemies of our democratic systems.
A  democracy  based  on  empty  stomachs  is  an  empty
democracy. All the  research  that  has  been  carried  out,
including  studies  by  the  United  Nations,  tell  us  that,
today  as  never  before,  formal  democracy  prevails
throughout  our  continent,  in  Latin  America.  However,
the  same  studies  tell  us  that,  today  more  than  ever,
dissatisfaction with our democratic systems is rampant.
Poverty  undermines  our  democracies  and  hunger
erodes  them.  We  know  that  combating  poverty  and
hunger  is  an  effort  that  must  be  shared  by  all.  In  our
case, in Honduras, with much participation on the part
of  our  citizens,  we  have  devised  a  strategy  to  combat
poverty that incorporates the Millennium Development
Goals. This legacy has been refined and perfected over
the  past  two  years.  The  strategy  to  combat  poverty  is
the  very  foundation  of  our  vision  as  a  country  and  of
our planning as a nation.
However,  alone  and  in  isolation,  our  efforts
undoubtedly will not be able to produce the hoped-for
results  for  our  people.  We  require  the  support  of  the
international  community.  International  cooperation  is
not a handout; it is an investment. Everyone, absolutely
everyone, derives benefit from it. Our small economies
are open to international trade and to globalization. We
do  not  fear  this  challenge;  in  fact,  we  see  that  it
provides tremendous opportunities to us.
However,  we  will  not  be  able  to  overcome  our
poverty  if  the  rules  of  international  trade  are  not  fair.
We  firmly  believe  that  protected  markets  lead  only  to
stagnation and the growth of poverty. It is not fair that
while we are opening our markets, other countries are
giving subsidies to their producers.
We welcome the decision of the United States to
return  to  the  International  Coffee  Organization,  but  at
the same time we ask that the hundreds of thousands of
families that grow coffee in rural areas be paid better.
Let  me  give  you  an  example.  Five  years  ago,  our
farmers earned 40 per cent of the price of coffee served
to the final consumer. Today, they earn only 9 per cent,
7
A/59/PV.8
while the companies in developed countries pocket the
difference. I invite the presidents and heads of State of
coffee-producing  countries  to  work  together  until  we
achieve a better price for all of our farmers. Together,
producers and consumers, we can make sure that coffee
is not a bitter drink for the producers.
If  the  price  of  coffee  can  have  a  rapid  and
massive  impact  on  the  struggle  against  poverty,  the
price  of  oil,  when  it  rises,  rapidly  makes  our  poverty
much  worse.  In  the  case  of  my  country,  over  the  past
year  the  increased  bill  for  oil  is  12  times  what  we
spend on providing school lunches to 870,000 boys and
girls  who  used  to  go  to  school  without  eating  every
day.  This  is  12  times  what  it  took  us  years  and  many
sacrifices  to  achieve.  The  world  has  seldom  seen  so
massive  a  transfer  of  resources  from  poor  importing
countries to wealthy oil-exporting countries.
I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to
international  conscience,  and  in  particular  to  the
conscience  of  oil-exporting  countries,  that  we  may
establish a trading system that brings about a reduction
in the price of oil  and helps to stabilize it. We need a
system  that  takes  account  of  poverty  in  countries  and
of the efforts that are being made to combat it. We need
a  system  that  enjoys  United  Nations  supervision  to
ensure that it is used properly.
I  am  making  a  formal  request  to  the  United
Nations  to  take  the  lead  in  this  matter.  I  am  not
exaggerating  when  I  say  that  there  are  few  other
actions  we  could  take  that  would  make  such  a  great
contribution  to  reducing  poverty.  I  would  also  like  to
appeal  to  the  developed  countries  to  use  oil  like  a
scarce  resource.  Let  them  continue  to  improve  fuel
efficiency  and  to  establish  taxes  that  reflect  the  true
cost of oil. Let them coordinate measures to make sure
that  demand  does  not  grow  unduly  and  make  prices
grow too fast. They should make prudent use of a non-
renewable resource to which we should all have access.
I  would  like  to  conclude  by  appealing  to  all  to
strengthen the United Nations system. That is the only
way  we  can  achieve  peace  in  the  world.  Let  us
subordinate  our  individual  agendas  in  order  to  find
agreed solutions here in the United Nations. The well-
being of the world demands that we act in this manner.
I  would  also  add  that  we  support  reforming  the
Security  Council  by 
the  number  of
permanent  and  non-permanent  members.  This  will
make  it  possible  for  countries  such  as  Japan  to
increasing 
8
participate,  as  well  as  a  representative  for  Latin
America.  This  will  lend  greater  legitimacy  to  the
Council(cid:146)s decisions. We also support an all-embracing
approach for the United Nations, which, in our opinion,
means  that  we  should  find  a  way  of  enabling  the
Chinese  people  in  Taiwan  to  participate  in  the  United
Nations processes.
As I said at the beginning, we are living in difficult
times,  but  this  is  also  a  time  of  great  opportunity.  We
hold  out  our  hand  in  friendship  to  everyone.  All  that
we ask in exchange is to be treated fairly.

Address by Mr. Jorge Batlle Ib√Ü√¶ez, President of the
Eastern Republic of Uruguay
The President (spoke in French): The Assembly
will  now  hear  an  address  by  the  President  of  the
Eastern Republic of Uruguay.
Mr. Jorge Batlle Ib√°√±ez, President of the Eastern
Republic  of  Uruguay,  was  escorted  into  the
General Assembly Hall.
The  President (spoke  in  French):  On  behalf  of
the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to
the  United  Nations  His  Excellency  Mr.  Jorge  Batlle
Ib√Ü√¶ez,  the  President  of  the  Eastern  Republic  of
Uruguay, and to invite him to address the Assembly.
President  Batlle  Ib√Ü√¶ez  (spoke  in  Spanish):
Today no one denies that globalization is here and that
it is here to stay. Not only has it changed the world of
communications so that now everything happens at the
same time throughout the world, but more importantly,
it  has  made  historical  borders  irrelevant.  The  young
generation  has  more  contact  with  other  young  people
living  thousands  of  miles  away  than  they  have  with
their own neighbours or family.
It  is  absolutely  true  that  a  global  culture  is
emerging  in  this  world.  While  this  is  happening,
countries  are  still  living  on  their  nationalisms,  their
secular  habits,  their  own  interests  and  their  parochial
projects  that  are  often  alien  to  the  new  realities.  The
question  that  we  leaders  ask  ourselves  (cid:151)  especially
inexorable  change  can  be  handled  by 
those of us who represent small nations  (cid:151)  is whether
this 
the
organizations  that  we  have  created,  or  whether  those
organizations  still  have  a  long  way  to  go  in  terms  of
adapting  to  the  new  reality.  When  we  look  at  the
impressive  success  achieved  by  the  United  Nations
since San Francisco in 1944, two things seem clear.
the 
First, 
institutions 
that  we  have  created
represent  the  greatest  and  most  successful  effort  ever
made by mankind to organize peaceful coexistence and
to endow the planet with the best possible instruments
for  dealing  with  the  important  aspects  of  human  lives
within human society.
Secondly,  it  is  equally  clear  that  the  world  has
changed  so  much  that  the  current  reality  now  far
exceeds  the  capacity  of  the  institutions  that  were
created  to  address  and  resolve  past  issues,  issues  that
today  have  taken  on  totally  different  characteristics.
Suffice  it  to  recall  that  the  founding  Members  of  the
United  Nations  numbered  51  and  that  today  there  are
191  Member  States.  More  important,  the  world(cid:146)s
population at that time was only half  what it is today.
And the total is inexorably rising towards 9 billion.
Furthermore,  over  the  past  40  years,  scientific
advances and the ensuing technological applications have
increased the resources of a very small group of nations,
leaving far behind many other countries, some of which
only  recently  gained  their  independence  and  most  of
which  are  rich  in  natural  resources  but  lack  the  basic
structures  needed  to  achieve  sustainable  growth  (cid:151)
countries, moreover, where, no doubt as a consequence
of  this,  the  population  is  increasing  at  very  high  rates
and where the resulting emigration to other continents
will soon create serious problems of coexistence.
Uruguay  has  been  a  Member  of  the  United
Nations  since  its  foundation  and  believes  in  the
Organization  and  in  the  varied  multilateral  agencies
that  support  its  efforts;  we  understand  the  need  to
consider  Charter  revision  so  that  nations  that  did  not
then  carry  the  weight  they  carry  today  can  assume
greater  obligations  in  the  inescapable  tasks  that  the
situation of mankind now imposes on us. It is time for
them  to  share  the  responsibility  with  the  five  nations
that assumed it nearly 60 years ago.

in
peacekeeping operations for many years. Uruguay is one
of the largest troop contributors, and is the very largest
if the ratio of its small population (cid:151) 3.4 million (cid:151) to

peacekeepers  is  taken  into  consideration.  We  have
participated in operations in Asia and in Africa, and we
are  currently  deployed  in  the  Democratic  Republic  of
the Congo, Haiti, Eritrea and elsewhere.
Uruguay  acknowledges  and  welcomes  the  wise
European Union effort to bring  equality  at the highest
level  to  European  nations  with  marked  differences  in
income  compared  with  the  richest  countries.  The
examples  of  Ireland,  Portugal,  Spain  and  Greece,
which will surely be emulated for new European Union
members, indicate what we in the United Nations must
do for the Congo and Haiti.
There is no point in achieving peace if the United
Nations lacks funds that can immediately be spent for the
practical  benefit  of  peoples 
in  extreme  economic
difficulties.  We  must  create  global  and 
largely
autonomous financial instruments to achieve those goals.
That is the only way for the United Nations to succeed.
A  tiny  nation  like  Haiti  (cid:151)  of  27,000  square
kilometres and 9 million inhabitants, where the average
number of  children per mother is 4.7 and which  lacks
the institutional and material infrastructure it needs (cid:151)
cannot  and  will  not  resolve  its  problems  merely
because a contingent of military forces from countries
of the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) is
keeping the peace.
Travelling  in  the  Congo  with  the  troops  we
recently  dispatched,  we  see  exactly  the  same  thing
happening:  a  nation  of  2.2  million  square  kilometres
and  a  population  of  50  million  does  not  have  a  road
going from one end of the country to the other. Without
autonomous,  ready  and  independent  means  of  coping
with  and  transforming  that  state  of  affairs,  the  United
Nations will not have solved anything at all even five,
10,  15  or  20  years  from  now.  Yet  only  the  United
Nations can handle such tasks.
Just more than three years since the fateful day of
11 September 2001 and just over six months since the
tragedy  in  Madrid,  new  and  terrible  forms  of  violence
continue  assailing  other  parts  of  the  world,  claiming
hundreds of innocent victims (cid:151) as we have recently seen
in Russia and as we see in the Middle East. This reveals
the destructive power that poses a permanent threat to the
world as a whole, a source of inescapable sadness and
a cause for despair about the human condition itself.
Terrorism  (cid:151)  and  a  genuine  commitment  to
combat and defeat it (cid:151) must therefore be the first item
9
A/59/PV.8
on our international agenda. Each State, each nation, each
community  and  each  human  being  must  contribute  to
this  endeavour;  that  is  how  we  can  help  the  United
Nations to fulfil its role as universal guarantor.
Combating this and other evils (cid:151) hunger, poverty,
underdevelopment, marginalization, exclusion (cid:151) requires
a  United  Nations  that  is  more  united,  nimbler  and  more
effective.  That  is  why  the  Organization  must  be  more
representative,  more  balanced  and  more  reliable:  so
that it can continue to be a reference point for the weak
and a restraining influence on the strong.
Here, our country has recently adopted legislation
strengthening  the  system  of  prevention  and  control  of
money  laundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  We
are in compliance with nearly all current treaties in this
area, and our legislation improves our mechanisms for
international  cooperation  against  money  laundering
and the financing of terrorism.
At  the  Millennium  Summit  and  in  the  Doha
Declaration  and  Monterrey  Consensus  we  agreed  on
principles,  goals  and  priorities,  and  we  made
commitments  which  we  reaffirmed  a  few  days  ago  at
the  summit  of  world  leaders  for  the  Action  Against
Hunger and Poverty. If we are to attain those goals, we
need  more  just  and  equitable  rules  of  international
trade.  That  is  how  to  ensure  that  this  becomes  a  key
stage  in  the  march  towards  the  social  and  political
stability that is today in serious jeopardy.
This  is  particularly  important  since  it  is  well
known  that  States  that  vociferously  preach  free  trade
and  demand  open  markets  (cid:151)  which  in  our  case  are
already entirely open (cid:151) themselves impose and institute
obstacles to trade, subsidize their production in distorting
ways and compete with countries such as mine and many
others, which have nothing to offer the world except the
labour of their people in the commodity and industrial
sectors, which further enriches the rich countries.
importance 
Uruguay  attaches  fundamental 
to
financial  and  trade  issues.  In  all  international  forums,
Uruguay calls for freer, more open markets. We favour
a  single  market  from  Alaska  to  Tierra  del  Fuego;  we
support  the  Doha  Agreement;  we  support  the  opening
of markets. We believe in freedom, but we believe also
that  freedom  is  indivisible:  there  can  be  no  political
freedom without economic freedom, and we think there
can be no economic freedom that does not go hand in
hand with political freedom.
10
We believe, therefore, that peoples can be strong
only  if  they  can  create  their  future  in  freedom.  We
cannot  build  and  stabilize  democracies  if  women  and
men cannot find an honest job to which to devote their
energies. That goal cannot be achieved with economic
assistance  alone  or  with  loans  that,  in  the  poorest
countries,  are  paid  back  only  with  great  difficulty.  It
can be brought about only with free trade (cid:151) something
that the world experienced in the nineteenth century.

In  conclusion,  Uruguay  will  continue  to  be

progressive development of international law, the most

realistic and committed manner. We continue to believe
in the United Nations as the collective instrument best
suited to our search for peace.

to your predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, as well as to the

If  there  has  been  one  consistent  and  predictable
area  of  convergence  in  our  debates  during  General

Never  before  has  our  world  been  so  insecure  or
faced such enormous challenges. Sadly, this insecurity
results  from  man(cid:146)s  inhumanity  and  his  insensitivity  to
human life. Yet it is also through man(cid:146)s efforts that the
effects  of  such  challenges  can  and  must  be  mitigated
or (cid:151) better still (cid:151) defeated.
It is common knowledge that the root cause of the
world(cid:146)s  insecurity  today  is  international  terrorism  and
armed conflict. Terrorist actions continue to haunt and
to  shock  us.  The  recent  murder  of  innocent,  young,
defenceless  school  children  in  Beslan,  Russia;  the
bombings  in  Indonesia;  and  daily  killings  in  Iraq,
Palestine  and  Israel,  are  simply 
to
countenance.  Equally,  the  recent  massacres  of  men,
women  and  children

Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo,  Burundi  and  the
Sudan are not only dastardly in the extreme, but stand
in stark contrast to everything that modern civilization,
humanity and morality espouse.

Our world will continue to be insecure for as long
as terrorists continue to be harboured and financed by
some States Members of the United Nations. We must
recognize  that  none  of  us  is  immune  from  terrorism.
But a more honest and practical solution would be for
all  States  Members  of  the  United  Nations  to  commit
A/59/PV.8
themselves not to harbour or finance terrorists and their
organizations.  In  that  way,  terrorists  would  have  no
safe  haven,  thus  rendering  it  possible  to  chase  them

We  submit  that  yet  another,  equally  pragmatic,
solution  may  be  found  in  the  answer  to  the  question:
what  is  it  that  drives  an  inherently  good  human  being
to  commit  such  inhuman  and  senseless  acts  of  State
terrorism,  organizational

For years now, the situation in Somalia has posed a
threat to international peace and security. The swearing-
in  of  Somalia(cid:146)s  transitional  parliament  on  22  August
2004,  in  Nairobi,  Kenya,  paves  the  way  for  genuine
recovery  for  Somalia.  In  that  regard,  my  delegation
compliments  the  Government  of  Kenya,  the  Inter-
Governmental  Authority  on  Development,  the  African
Union  and  all  other  stakeholders  for  their  efforts  to
bring  about  normalcy  in  Somalia.  We  must  not  allow
the  momentum  to  decrease,  or  the  process  to  be
derailed by those who seek to fuel hatred, division and
the  killing  of  the  people  of  Somalia,  including  as  a
result  of  the  smuggling  of  arms,  which  takes  place
despite the arms embargo.
The  humanitarian  and  security  crises  engulfing
the Darfur region in the Sudan are a cause for serious
concern  to  all  of  us.  A  lot  has  been  said  about  that
11
A/59/PV.8
grave situation, but not much has been done to contain
the humanitarian and political crises.
However,  my  delegation  is  hopeful  that  words
will  finally  translate  into  action.  We  had  hoped  that,
with  the  help  of  the  African  Union  mediators,  the
representatives of the Government of the Sudan and the
two rebel groups (cid:151) the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA)
and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) (cid:151) could
be  persuaded  to  sign  and  respect  the  protocol  on
security.  We  reiterate  our  call  to  all  concerned  parties
to  enter  into  negotiations.  We  wish  to  remind  the
Government  of  the  Sudan  that  it  is  its  primary
responsibility, first and foremost, to protect the civilian
life of its nationals.
The  Great  Lakes  region  remains  politically
volatile.  This  situation  has  been  exacerbated  by  the

thought  that  the  gains  that  had  been  made  from  the
Congolese  dialogue, 
in  South  Africa,  could  be
consolidated.  We  reiterate  the  call  by  the  Secretary-
General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for renewed commitment by

international community to work in full partnership to

It is worth mentioning that, at the regional level,
the  Southern  African  Development  Community
(SADC) heads of State or Government,  at their  recent
summit  in  Mauritius,  mandated  the  SADC  Organ  on

remain  seized  of  the  situation  in  the  Democratic
Republic of the Congo.
My delegation has never condoned the killings of
Israelis  by  the  Palestinians  or  of  Palestinians  by  the
Israelis. We have always considered the root causes of
the  problem  in  the  Middle  East,  which  is  the  illegal
occupation of Palestinian lands by Israel. That problem
has been exacerbated by the construction by Israel of a
separation  wall  in  the  occupied  Palestinian  territory.

to Israel to implement the important resolution adopted
by  the  General  Assembly  in  view  of  the  Court(cid:146)s
advisory  opinion.  Moreover,  it  is  our  submission  that,
unless  and  until  the  issue  of  the  inalienable  rights  of
the Palestinian people is addressed vigorously, urgently
and  truthfully,  peace  and  security  will  remain  elusive

However,  we  did  not  anticipate  that,  as  we
approach  the  comprehensive  review  in  2005,  the
HIV/AIDS  pandemic  would  have  become  the  greatest
threat to life itself, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.
Undoubtedly,  the  HIV/AIDS  pandemic  threatens  to
render  futile  and  irrelevant  all  our  efforts  at  the
betterment  of  humankind,  including  the  attainment  of
the Millennium Development Goals.
As  early  as  the  year  2000,  Lesotho  had  declared
HIV/AIDS  a  national  disaster,  and  various  measures
were  being  taken  at  the  national  level  to  control  and
manage the pandemic. We have not been alone in that
fight,  fortunately.  It  is  in  that  spirit  that  we  wish  to
recognize and appreciate the dedication of Mr. Stephen
Lewis,  Special  Envoy  of  the  Secretary-General  for
HIV/AIDS in Africa, and of Mr. James Morris, Special
Envoy for Humanitarian Needs in Southern Africa.
Through  his  advocacy,  Mr.  Lewis  has  helped
Lesotho  start  a  robust  programme  of  antiretroviral
treatment,  while  Mr.  Morris(cid:146)s  initiatives  have  ensured
food  supply  for  vulnerable  and  orphaned  children.
Interventions  of  this  nature  give  credence  to  the  lofty
declarations  adopted  at  various  international  summits
on  the  HIV/AIDS  pandemic,  as  they  complement  and
strengthen our own initiatives and limited resources.

By  the  same  token,  the  unilateral  economic
embargo  against  Cuba  is  causing  untold  misery  to  the
people  of  that  country.  My  delegation  believes  that,
when two countries are at war with each other, or when
a  country  has  been  condemned  by  the  international
community 
for  gross  misconduct,  an  economic
embargo  could  be  justifiable.  However,  we  are  not
aware that any war has been declared against Cuba, or
that  the  Government  of  Cuba  has  compromised  or
broken  international  law.  We  therefore  remain  in  the
dark  as  to  what  might  justify  the  victimization  of
millions  of  Cubans  by 
the  unilateral  economic
blockade,  for  we  contend  that  it  is  the  sovereign,
democratic  and,  indeed,  sacred  right  of  the  people  of
Cuba  to  determine  the  system  of  Government  most
appropriate for their country. Accordingly, we urge that
normalcy  be  restored  to  Cuba  through  the  removal  of
the economic blockade.
The  coming  into  operation  of  the  International
Criminal  Court  signifies,  in  our  view,  an  end  to
impunity.  We  are  elated  that  there  now  exists  an
international  body  that  can  take  over  when  national
courts are unable or unwilling to try perpetrators of the
most  egregious  violations  of  human  rights.  We  would
indeed live in a safer world if State parties to the Rome
Statute  of  the  International  Criminal  Court  adhered  to
it, and if the  Court  attained  universal  jurisdiction.  My

delegation encourages States that have not yet ratified
the Statute to do so as a matter of urgency (cid:151) indeed,
as a matter of common sense.

In order for the United Nations family to address
today(cid:146)s  challenges  effectively,  the  Organization  must
be  reformed,  with  the  Security  Council  being  the
central focus of that effort. The Security Council must
reflect the reality of the international community in the
twenty-first  century.  That  must  be  done  against  the
background  of  multilateralism,  upon  which  international
peace and security is premised. In that regard, allow me
to  congratulate  His  Excellency  Mr. Julian  Hunte,
President  of  the  General  Assembly  at  its  fifty-eighth
session,  for 
the  hard  work  and  commitment  he
displayed  as  the  Chair  of  the  Open-ended  Working

like  first 
I take this opportunity to express our appreciation
to  the  President  of  the  General  Assembly  at  its  fifty-
eighth session, His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte. Over
the  last  twelve  months  he  has  successfully  guided  the
Assembly(cid:146)s  work  with  exemplary  dedication  and
initiative.
I would also like, at the outset of my intervention
this  afternoon,  to  take  the  opportunity  to  express  the
solidarity  of  the  Maltese  people  with  those  countries
and people who have suffered loss of life and damage
to property as a result of the recent spate of hurricanes
and  tropical  storms,  particularly  the  people  of  Haiti.
We, the Maltese people, pledge our support in this hour
of need.
It  is  a  source  of  particular  satisfaction  for  me  to
address  the  Assembly  for  the  first  time  as  Prime
Minister of Malta, and also for Malta in its new role as
a member of the European Union. The President of the
Union(cid:146)s  Council  of  Ministers,  the  Foreign  Minister  of
the Netherlands, has already laid before the Assembly
the objectives and priorities of the 25 members of the
Union for the coming months.
The  upholding  and  development  of  international
law  and  effective  multilateralism  are  central  to  the
European  Union(cid:146)s  external  actions.  The  role  of  the
United  Nations  is  vital  in  this  regard.  Malta  has
consistently  supported  the  view  that  the  international
community needs this universal forum within which it
can  collectively  deliberate  and  act  upon  the  many
problems  that  confront  it.  Our  membership  in  the
European  Union  gives  renewed  scope  and  added
dimension  to  our  commitment  to  the  United  Nations
and its role in international affairs.
Recent events have raised urgent questions about
the extent to which the United Nations is fulfilling the
role envisaged for it under the Charter. Inevitably this
leads to some serious concerns about the effectiveness
of our Organization. Nevertheless, the questions which
have been raised do not diminish the case not only for
14
its continued existence but also for its strengthening as
a world body. As we survey the latest developments in
crises spots around the globe, the realization intensifies
that  solutions  to  the  major  problems  of  our  age  are
beyond  the  grasp  and  control  of  any  single  nation  or
particular  group  of  nations,  however  powerful  and
determined.

At the same time, however, the Secretary-General

that,  as  the  Secretary-General  reminds  us,  there  are  at
present  more  than  56,000  uniformed  personnel  and

years after what was expected to be the dawn of a new

issues 
involved 
High  on  the  agenda  in  this  context  is  the  reform
of  the  Security  Council.  As  currently  constituted,  the
Council  suffers  from  three  noticeable  weaknesses.
First, it has limited means of adequately addressing the
development 
in  security  matters.
Secondly,  the  regional  distribution  of  authority  in  the
Council  is  severely  lopsided.  And,  thirdly,  the  great
majority of Member States, especially the smaller ones,
are  underrepresented 
the
Council. Urgent remedies need to be found for all these
weaknesses  for  the  Council  to  be  able  to  continue  to
play a relevant role in the twenty-first century.

the
time-consuming  procedures  and
debilitating  and 
its  universality,  while  discarding 
in 
A/59/PV.8
working  methods  that  such  universality  has  bred.  The
major  organs  and  specialized  agencies  of  the  United
Nations  system  also  need  to  devise  improved  ways  of
harmonizing,  through  the  Economic  and  Social  Council,
their  many  impressive,  but  often  disparate,  efforts  to
foster sustainable social and economic development.
One  of  the  underlying  strengths  of  the  United
Nations  system  lies  in  the  manner  in  which  it  permits
action  at  the  regional  level  to  insert  itself  into  global
efforts towards peace, security and cooperation. In recent
years, the progressive strengthening of the African Union
has added a welcome partner to the regional framework,
in what is, unfortunately, the region of greatest need.
The  recently  enlarged  European  Union  has  also
been  progressively  enhancing  its  cooperation  with  the
United Nations  at  both  the  regional  and  higher  levels.
The Secretary-General refers in his report on the work
of the Organization (A/59/1) to the significant progress in
EU/United  Nations  cooperation  on  conflict  prevention,
peace-building  and  post-conflict  reconstruction,  as  well
as in crisis management activities.
One area in which the EU and the United Nations
are active and important partners concerns the question
of  Palestine.  As  members  of  the  Quartet,  the  EU  and
the United Nations play a significant role by injecting a
much-needed  balance  and  objectivity  into  an  issue
tormented  by  violence  and  passion.  Both  the  EU  and
the  United  Nations  are  by  right  major  stakeholders  in
the issue. History and geographical proximity underpin
the  special  interest  of  all  EU  member  States  in  the
prosperity  and  well-being  of  both 
Israelis  and
Palestinians.  The  creation  and  peaceful  coexistence  of
two neighbouring States, Israel and Palestine, was one
of the United Nations very first, but unfortunately still
unfulfilled, recommendations.
After  decades  of  bitterness  and  wrong  turns,  the
issue of Palestine remains jeopardized by the forces of
extremism  and 
intransigence.  But  extremism  and
intransigence (cid:151) as manifested by both the perpetrators
of  Palestinian  suicide  bombings  and  Israeli  advocates
of  a  continuing  and  forceful  military  occupation  of
Palestinian  territories  (cid:151)  do  have  a  counterbalance  on
both  sides,  as  manifested  by  the  Geneva  Initiative  of
late  last  year,  among  many  other  examples.  The  EU
and the United Nations need to continuously exert their
influence and pressure on both sides to persuade them
to  give  greater  heed  and  credibility  to  the  voices  of
reason which lie in their midst.

A/59/PV.8
The  path  to  legality  and  reconciliation  has  been
defined in the road map, in the many resolutions of the
Security Council and the General Assembly and, most
recently,  in  the  advisory  opinion  of  the  International
Court of Justice. Even in the face of constant setbacks
on  the  ground,  the  EU  and  United  Nations  Quartet
partners  need  to  remain  steadfast  in  their  insistence
that  the  road  to  peace  can  only  be  set  within  those
parameters.
Malta  looks  at  the  problem  both  from  its  tragic
humanitarian  dimension  as  well  as  from  its  far-
reaching  implications  for  peace  and  security.  One
important  concern  for  us  in  that  regard  is  the  impact
that the problem has on issues of peace and security in
the Middle East in general and the Mediterranean area
in particular.

the  development, 
One  of  the  primary  objectives  of  the  European
Union 
through
partnership, of a common zone of peace, prosperity and
progress in the Mediterranean and the Middle East. In
recent  months  the  Union  has  elaborated  a  policy
agenda for that strategic partnership linking together a
number of instruments and mechanisms that have been
put  in  place  over  the  years.  The  Euro-Mediterranean
Partnership (cid:151) the Barcelona or Euromed process (cid:151) and
the European Neighbourhood Policy are the frameworks
of that policy. A key element in the EU approach is the
parallel 
the  processes  of
security-building  and  to  cooperation  in  the  social,
economic, cultural and humanitarian fields. In that way
it  ensures  that  the  evolving  relationships  in  the  Euro-

and needs of the individual countries and regions.

important  contributory  factor  towards  growth  and
stability. With the exception of the situation in Kosovo,
which  remains  disturbing,  and  some  other  examples,
progress in the Balkan region is encouraging.
relationships  with 
The  almost  decade-long  EuroMed  process  has
gradually but steadily put into place a useful structure
for the strengthening and consolidation of relationships
among  the  countries  of  the  Mediterranean.  It  not  only
contributes to the economic and social development of
individual  countries,  but  also  provides  a 
stable
background in which some of the wider problems may be

tackled,  taking  into  account  the  strong  linkage  that
exists between security and cooperation in Europe and
in  the  Mediterranean.  It  needs  strengthening  and
broadening,  and  in  that  context,  the  participation  of
Libya  in  the  Barcelona  Euromed  process  would  be
particularly welcome.
One  such 
issue  concerns 
the  question  of
migration  from  the  southern  to  the  northern  shores  of
the Mediterranean. As in other parts of the world, that
issue needs to be tackled from the economic, social and
political,  as  well  as  the  humanitarian,  perspective.
Because  of  its  geographical  location  and  small  size,
Malta  has  a  special  sensitivity  to  the  many  problems
and complexities of the issue. We are hopeful that the
spirit of cooperation and understanding provided by the
EuroMed  process  can  help  countries  in  our  region  to
successfully tackle the challenges involved.

development of weapons of mass destruction still exist
in  other  regions  of  the  world.  The  role  that  can  be
played by initiatives encouraging regional stability and
economic  and  social  development  in  the  resolution  of
these problems should not be underestimated.
factor 
to  renounce 
We must also look at the  problems raised by the
threat  of  new  weapons  of  mass  destruction  as  part  of
the  wider  issue  of  disarmament  in  its  many  aspects.
The  continuing  commitment  to  the  major  multilateral
treaties  and  increased  efforts  to  intensify  measures  of
verification and compliance are of paramount importance
in this regard. Equally important is the need to bring the
Comprehensive  Nuclear-Test-Ban  Treaty  into  force
without further delay.
The  problem  of  the  proliferation  of  weapons,
especially weapons of mass destruction, has in our day
assumed  a  new  and  frightening  dimension  in  its
possible  linkage  with  terrorism.  In  this  regard,  as  the

out, 
the 
The fight against terrorism involves all of us and
needs to be pursued with firmness and tenacity. At the
same  time,  the  struggle  must  take  place  on  our  terms
and  not  those  of  the  terrorists.  As  the  Secretary-
General  takes  every  opportunity  to  remind  us,  this
struggle  must  not  take  place  at  the  expense  of  the
fundamental freedoms and basic dignity of individuals,
neither  must  we  allow  the  legitimate  concern  to
eradicate  terrorism  in  all  its  aspects  to  distract  the
commitment of the global community in its endeavour
towards  the  economic  and  social  development  of  the
less advantaged regions of the world.
In conclusion, our concerns for the safety of our
people must be counter-balanced by the assurances that
those responsible for these threats will be dealt with by
a coherent and effective system of trans-frontier justice

As  in  previous  years,  the  issues  before  of  the
General Assembly are many and complex. The density
and variety of the agenda we have before us are both a
challenge  and  an  opportunity  for  our  Organization.  I
trust that under your  able guidance, Mr. President, we
will  find  the  energy  and  wisdom  to  meet  these
challenges and exploit these opportunities. Humanity is
counting on all of us.

to  congratulate  you,  Mr.  President,  a  distinguished

commend  your  predecessor,  Mr.  Julian  Hunte,  for  the
dedication and commitment that he brought to bear on
his stewardship of the fifty-eighth session.
Three  years  ago,  a  terrible  tragedy  hit  this  city.
The  unprecedented  terrorist  attacks  of  11  September
resulted in the death of thousands of innocent people of
many  nationalities,  including  some  from  my  own
country,  Ghana.  The  whole  world  shared  the  pain  and
sorrow  of  New  York  in  the  aftermath  of  those
atrocities. The whole world also rose in solidarity with
the  people  of  the  United  States  to  ensure  that  such
tragedies would not happen again.
11  September  reminds  us  of  the  importance  of
seeking  a  multilateral  and  peaceful  means  for  the
maintenance  of 
international  peace  and  security,
especially  now,  when  it  has  become  evident  that  only
collective, multilateral efforts will suffice to defeat the
new scourge of mankind, global terrorism.
The  United  Nations  has  an  indispensable  role  to
play,  being  the  most  universal  and  representative
intergovernmental organization  and the best forum  for
the practice of multilateralism. However, the success of
17
A/59/PV.8
multilateralism  and  collective  security  will  depend  on
how  the  reforms  of  the  United  Nations  system  are
implemented.  In  this  regard,  we  applaud  the  initiative
of  our  illustrious  compatriot,  Secretary-General  Kofi
Annan,  in  setting  up  the  United  Nations  High-Level
Panel  on  Threats,  Challenges  and  Change,  to  make
proposals  on  how  the  United  Nations  can  best  be
reformed to meet the new challenges of our world.
We,  in  Africa,  agree  that  the  objectives  of  the
United Nations reforms, including the revitalization of
the  General  Assembly  and  the  reform  of  the  Security
Council,  are  aimed  at  enhancing  the  role  of  the
Organization  and  its  capacity  to  overcome  current
threats  and  emerging  challenges.  The  reforms  should
be  in  conformity  with  the  purposes  and  principles  of
the  United  Nations  Charter  and  the  process  must  be
based  on  full  consultations  in  a  democratic  and
transparent manner. To this end, we  look forward to a
revitalized  General  Assembly  that  would  assume  its
rightful  position  as 
the  most  authoritative  and
representative organ of the United Nations.
With  regard  to  the  Security  Council,  the  African
position emphasizes the need to democratize and ensure
equitable  geographical  representation,  with  Africa
allotted no less than two permanent seats and five non-
permanent seats in the expanded Security Council.

in  which
widespread  poverty  is  endemic,  particularly  in  Africa.
As we strive to overcome our current economic woes,
we  need  the  world(cid:146)s  solidarity,  resources,  technical
know-how  and  support.  The  historic  Millennium
Summit of the United Nations, which brought together
189  nations  in  September  2000  and  adopted  the
Millennium Declaration, was a clarion call for action to
solve  these  problems  and  set  forth  the  Millennium
Development Goals with measurable goals and  targets
for combating them. On that occasion, the international
community  pledged  to  spare  no  effort  to  free  our
fellow  men,  women  and  children  from  the  abject  and
dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty.
Africa has adopted the New Partnership for Africa(cid:146)s
Development  (NEPAD),  which  reaffirms  our  belief  that
Africans  have  the  primary  responsibility  to  solve  the
problems  of  poverty,  hunger,  disease  and  illiteracy
afflicting  the  majority  of  our  population  and  to  stem
Africa(cid:146)s marginalization from global markets. In tandem,

we  are  striving  to  foster  political  stability,  accountable
and  transparent  governance  under  the  rule  of  law,
because  we  believe  it  is  the  right  thing  to  do.  Ghana
has  volunteered  as  the  first  country  in  Africa  for  the
African Peer Review Mechanism, and my Government
is  cooperating  with  the  review  panel  to  facilitate  the
preparation of the review report, because we in Ghana
cherish very much our democracy and our commitment
of respect for human rights and the rule of law.

Our  renewed  resolve,  within  the  context  of

the  avowed
commitment  of  the  international  community  to  help
achieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goals.  It  was,
therefore,  a  very  welcome  and  positive  development
when  the  General  Assembly,  in  its  resolution  57/7  of
4 November  2002,  urged  the  international  community
to  organize  support  for  African  countries  within  the
framework  of  the  principles,  objectives  and  priorities
of  NEPAD.  However,  for  this  convergence  of  vision
and  effort  to  yield  the  desired  results,  there  must  be

for concern. In this connection, it is pertinent to recall
that  an  additional  $50  billion  a  year  in  development

a serious security threat.
Unfortunately,  despite  the  substantial  measures

gender  equality  has  been  an  essential  element  of
Ghana(cid:146)s efforts to attain sustainable development. The

environment  in  which  to  operate.  In  that  regard,  we
will  continue  to  condemn  all  attacks  against  United
Nations personnel and call for firm action by States to
establish  conditions  that  prevent  such  attacks,  in
fulfilment of the obligations of host countries towards
the United Nations and its personnel.
Ghana,  as  a  major  troop-contributing  country,
will  continue  to  support  United  Nations  peacekeeping
operations  globally,  as  well  as 
in  Africa.  That
commitment, which began with our participation in the
United Nations Operation in the Congo in 1960, is born
of  the  firm  moral  conviction  in  our  solidarity  for
humanity  and  the  knowledge  that  a  lack  of  peace  and
stability  anywhere  can  be  a  real  threat  to  peace  and
security for all of us.

themselves  individually  and  collectively  to  the  ideals
that underpin the Organization and provide it with the
commensurate  resources  as  it  strives  to  fulfil  the
aspirations  of  the  peoples  of  the  world.  We  cannot,

pleasure  in  welcoming  Her  Excellency  Mrs.  Sandra
Pierantozzi,  Vice-President  of  the  Republic  of  Palau,
and inviting her to address the General Assembly.
Mrs.  Pierantozzi  (Palau):  This  is  a  momentous
year for our country as we celebrate, on 1 October, the
tenth  anniversary  of  our 
independence  and  our
membership  in  this  institution.  Palau  was  the  last
country to emerge from the Trusteeship System, having
20
been  administered  by  the  United  States  under  the
supervision  of  the  United  Nations  longer  than  any
country  in  the  world.  It  was  the  United  Nations  that
provided  Palau  with  a  willing  forum  in  which  to
express and ultimately achieve our right to sovereignty,
and  for  that  we  are  ever  thankful.  I  am  also  happy  to
observe,  on  this  tenth  anniversary,  that  this  year  we
established,  for  the  first  time,  a  permanent  mission  in
New  York  so  that  we  can  enhance  our  ability  to  meet
our international responsibilities.
It  was 
through 
the  United  States, 
its
administration  and  willing  cooperation  during  our
peaceful emergence into independence, that assured us
the liberty and the values that guide us today. For that
extraordinary  legacy,  we  today  express  our  deep
gratitude to the United States of America.
it  coincides  with 
This  is  a  good  year  for  Palau  to  deepen  its
involvement,  since 
the  world(cid:146)s
preparation  for  the  Mauritius  conference  and  the
increased emphasis at the United Nations on the unique
challenges  facing  small 
island  developing  States.
While  images  of  swaying  palm  trees  and  white  sand
beaches  prevail  in  the  world(cid:146)s  imagination,  they  are
only  part  of  the  story.  In  truth  and  in  fact,  the
remoteness  and  the  isolation  of  Palau  make  it  a  very
difficult  place  to  develop  a  self-reliant  economy,
provide  medical  care  and  education  to  its  people  and
deter aggression and terrorism. Fuel and transportation
prices  are  among  the  highest  in  the  world.  After  four
successive  colonial  administrations,  our  infrastructure
is  quite  incomplete,  and  our  most  promising  hope  for
the development of a sustainable economy, our pristine
environment,  is  threatened  by  factors  beyond  our
control,  such  as  the  failure  of  all 
industrialized
countries  to  reach  agreement  on  implementing  the
Kyoto Protocol.
We  have  created  a  democratic  society  and
ensured  human  rights  for  our  people,  but  without
international focus, we will not be able to provide hope
and  opportunity  to  our  children,  and  we  will  continue
to  watch  as  they  leave  their  homeland  to  seek  an
education  and  a  career  elsewhere.  For  no  matter  what
statistics  may  be  advanced,  what  references  to  gross
national product may be debated, until we can provide
our  children  with  the  incentive  to  stay  and  help  build
our  country,  we  will  have  lost.  Thus,  the  Mauritius
process  is  critical  for  Palau,  and  we  trust  that  the
developed countries of the world will embrace it.
Similarly,  we  trust  that  United  Nations  agencies
will sharpen their focus on the small island developing
States  and  correct  what  we  view  as  a  current
imbalance, in support of the fragile small States of the
world.  We  applaud  the  recent  efforts  of  the  Global
Environmental  Facility  (GEF)  to  streamline  assistance
to  Palau  through  the  creation  of  an  innovative  North
Pacific  subregional  programme  that  will  build  our
capacity  to  protect  our  environment  and  create  a
sustainable economy.
We are troubled, however, by a growing tendency
in the donor community to demand that small countries
like  ours  prove  our  capacity  before  assistance  can  be
delivered. This is a catch-22 situation that threatens to
halt our development. The only way we  can build our
capacity to execute projects that will save, for example,
our unique biodiversity is to experience the hard work
of  completing  projects  and 
from  our
experience.
learning 
This  observation  does  not  mean  that  we  are
reluctant  to  accept  the  obligations  and  responsibilities
inherent  in  receiving  assistance.  We  are  willing  and
eager to be monitored by  the  international  community
in  our  performance.  We  firmly  believe  that  we  should
be  held  accountable

transparency of our efforts.
the  quality  and 
for 
It is ironic that tiny countries such as ours, where
so  many  of  the  world(cid:146)s  environmental  treasures  exist,
are denied the assistance they need due to a perceived
lack of capacity to navigate the unwieldy bureaucracies of
the  international  organizations  charged  with  protecting
those very treasures.
to 
As already noted, the failure of the world to come
to agreement on implementing the Kyoto Protocol will
contribute 
the  destruction  of  our  marine  and
terrestrial  resources.  Palau,  like  many  other  small
island  developing  States,  is  a  window  on  the  world(cid:146)s
future  in  this  regard  and  must  be  carefully  observed.
We  urge  the  GEF  to  create  real  funding  opportunities
for  adaptation  and  mitigation  measures  in  a  proactive
and streamlined fashion before it is too late.
In a similar vein, we are increasingly aware of the
particularly  damaging  fishing  practice  of  deep-sea
bottom  trawling.  Increasingly  employed  on  the  high
seas  as  coastal  fisheries  are  depleted,  this  technique
entails  dragging  heavy  equipment  along  the  seabed,
completely  destroying  established  coral,  sponge  and
related  communities  that  have  taken  centuries  to
A/59/PV.8
develop.  We  are  a  culture  of  fishing  people  and  find
this practice unacceptable. As we participated with our
Pacific colleagues in eliminating drift-net fishing some
years  ago,  we  now  call  upon  the  world  to  join  us  in
declaring  a  moratorium  on  deep  sea  bottom  trawling
before this practice does any more irremediable damage.
Last  month,  Palau(cid:146)s  accession  to  the  Group  of
Asian  States  created  the  largest  regional  grouping  in
the  United  Nations.  Two  critical  issues  involving  our
Asian region also have great global significance.

Secondly, and also in pursuit of the most effective
means  to  strengthen  the  credibility  of  the  United
Nations, Palau urges the United Nations to  reform the
Security  Council 
the
international community in the twenty-first  century so
that countries that play a major role in the maintenance
of  international  peace  and  security  always  participate
in the decision-making process of the Security Council.
Palau  believes  that  the  Security  Council  should  be
expanded 
include  additional  developing  and
developed countries as new members, and that Japan(cid:146)s
stellar record of contribution is a solid basis for Japan(cid:146)s
assumption  of  permanent  membership  of  the  Security
Council.  Japan  has  been  a  leader  in  international
initiatives for many years, and it is for that reason that
Palau takes this strongly felt position.
Much  of  my  presentation  today  has  focused  on
the  enormous  threats  to  vulnerable  island  States  like
Palau.  We  agree  with  the  Secretary-General,  who
observed  in  his  opening  remarks  to  the  high-level
segment  of  the  twelfth  session  of  the  Commission  on
Sustainable  Development,  held  at  United  Nations
Headquarters  from  28  to  30  April  2004,  that  (cid:147)high-
level  political  attention  has  been  diverted  from
sustainable development by the recent emphasis given
to terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and the war
21
A/59/PV.8
in Iraq(cid:148). But Palau also understands that the scourge of
global  terrorism  and  its  immoral  violence  against
innocent people must be defeated. We are proud of our
sons  and  daughters  serving  in  the  United  States
military.  Only  last  week,  one  of  those  sons,  a  Marine
fighting side by side with Coalition forces in Iraq, paid
the ultimate price, marking the first death of a Palauan
in  the  struggle  with  global  terrorism.  Our  forces  are
small in number but, like Corporal Ngirmidol, large in
loyalty,  commitment  and  idealism.  No  one  should
make any mistake about that.
Palau is grateful to the United States for allowing
us  to  achieve  our  independence  and  thus  to  join  the
international  community(cid:146)s  quest  for  world  peace.
Nonetheless,  a  balanced  international  agenda  which
includes a determined focus on sustainable development
is  required  if  Palau  is  to  achieve  some  measure  of
economic self-reliance, and if the world as we know it
is to survive.
The  President (spoke  in  French):  On  behalf  of
the  General  Assembly,  I  wish  to  thank  the  Vice
President  and  Minister  of  Health  of  the  Republic  of
Palau for the statement she has just made.
Mrs.  Sandra  Pierantozzi,  Vice-President  and

Address by His Serene Highness Prince Albert,
Crown Prince of the Principality of Monaco
The  President (spoke  in  French):  The  Assembly
will now hear an address by His Serene Highness Prince
Albert, Crown Prince of the Principality of Monaco.
His Serene Highness Prince Albert, Crown Prince
of the Principality of Monaco, was escorted to the
rostrum.
The  President (spoke  in  French):  On  behalf  of
the  General  Assembly,  I  have  great  pleasure 
in
welcoming His Serene Highness Prince Albert, Crown
Prince of the Principality of Monaco, and inviting him
to address the Assembly.
Crown  Prince  Albert  (Monaco)  (spoke 
in
French):  It  is  with  great  pleasure  that  I  congratulate
you,  Sir,  on  your  unanimous  election  to  preside  over
the  fifty-ninth  session  of  the  General  Assembly,  an
election  that  offers  Africa  its  tenth  presidency.  The
Gabonese  Republic

and the French-speaking countries are delighted to see
one  of  our  own  guiding  our  debates.  Be  assured  that
the  delegation  of  Monaco,  which  I  am  leading,  will
fully support you in your noble mission in the service
of peace and development. I would also like to hail the
Secretary-General  for  his  courage  and  his  unwavering
commitment to peace.
A  long  time  ago,  the  Organization  began  a
process  of  thinking  through  the  reforms  that  are
required to improve its functioning. In that connection,
I  would  like  to  congratulate  the  outgoing  President  of
the Assembly, Mr. Julian Hunte, on his work during the
fifty-eighth  session;  his  perseverance  made  possible
the adoption of new measures to revitalize the work of
the General Assembly. While welcoming that progress,
we know that we must continue along that path.
Dedication  to  democracy  and  to  the  rule  of  law,
unswerving confidence in the virtues of multilateralism
and  respect  for  our  differences  allow  us  to  move
forward in a spirit of harmony and to continue to adapt
the Organization to meet the challenges of our time. It
is  vital  that  the  Organization  be  provided  with  the
means  to  better  respond  to  the  expectations  of  the
peoples of the world.
This  is  why  the  Principality  supports  initiatives
aimed  at  improving  the  Organization(cid:146)s  methods  of
work  and,  in  particular,  those  regarding  Security
Council  reform.  Enlargement  of  the  Council,  in  both
permanent and non-permanent seats, will strengthen its
capacity to contribute to the essential objectives of the
maintenance  of  peace  by  providing  more  equitable
representation of the diverse  regions that compose the
international community.
The  fifteenth  International  AIDS  Conference,
held  in  Thailand  last  July,  once  again  highlighted  the
devastation caused by this terrible pandemic as well as
its  disastrous  social  consequences.  However, 
the
Conference  also  demonstrated  that  when  international
organizations,  Governments  and  civil  society  agree  to

For my part, I have expressed the wish that all of
the Principality(cid:146)s school children participate in marking a

number could reach 100 million by the year 2010.

been providing regular support for the activities of the
Joint  United  Nations  Programme  on  HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS)  since  its  creation,  and  I  am  pleased  to
announce 
to
strengthen 
the
Programme. We hope that the creation within UNAIDS
of  the  Programme  Acceleration  Fund  will  allow  us  to

themselves. In effect, we are convinced of the necessity
for  States  to  strengthen,  on  the  one  hand,  their

Upon  the  initiative  of  His  Serene  Highness  the
Sovereign  Prince,  my  father, 
the  Principality  of
Monaco has always expressed its solidarity to the most
underdeveloped populations. We share the concerns of
world  leaders  regarding  the  adverse  impact  that  the
persistence  of  extreme  poverty 
is  having  on
international security.
We  shall  therefore  consider  most  carefully  the
elaboration  of  a  new  global  partnership  designed  to
eliminate hunger and poverty and to advance economic
development and social justice, as a continuation to the
commitments  undertaken  at  the  Millennium  Summit
and during the Monterrey Conference.
Terrorism,  unfortunately,  has  become  a  daily
reality,  as  is  attested  to  by,  among  others,  the  tragedy
that took place in Beslan, which is repugnant to all of
us. Our determination to fight it must remain unshaken
and  that  is  why  we  welcome  the  establishment  of  an
executive  directorate  of 
the  Counter-Terrorism
Committee. In that domain, international cooperation is
an  essential  element  for  effective  action.  No  State,
regardless  of  its  size,  can  be  a  weak  link  that  might
endanger the efforts we are conducting together.
Therefore, the Principality intends to play its role
in the battle which our Organization is waging against
terrorism. Thus, Monaco has become a party to all of the
twelve  conventions  designed  to  eradicate  international
A/59/PV.8
terrorism  and  has  adopted,  as  domestic  legislation,
appropriate measures for their implementation.
But the battle against terrorism also requires that
we  act  irreproachably  in  terms  of  our  respect  for
human  rights.  Accordingly,  the  Principality  is  making
every  effort  to  guarantee  them  on  its  territory;  hence
Monaco(cid:146)s forthcoming accession to the Convention on
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against
Women.
The  number  of  refugees  and  displaced  persons
who are displaced within their own countries continues
to  increase,  and  our  response  to  the  unbearable
suffering  of  those  human  beings  cannot  be  limited  to
our  moral  indignation.  As  in  any  urgent  and  complex
emergency situation, civilians and the most vulnerable
among them are the targets of harm and the worst types
of abuse. The humanitarian disaster which continues to
take  place  under  our  very  eyes  in  Darfur  has  shown,
once  again,  how  limited  we  are  in  our  capacity  to
enforce  respect  for  human  rights  and  for  international
humanitarian law.
to  earmark 
In response to the appeal launched by the Office
the  United  Nations  High  Commissioner 
for
of 
Refugees  (UNHCR)  during  the  special  session  of  the
General Assembly on children in 2002, the authorities
of  Monaco  decided

refugee  children.  We  hope  to  provide  those  children,
whose  world  has  been  brutally  shattered  overnight,  a
substitute for their traditional educational environment,
by allowing them to escape, albeit a little, those terrible
conditions  of  daily  life  dominated  by  promiscuity  and
the anguish of having forever lost their homes.

rights  of  children  do  not  fall  under  a  statute  of

The  Principality  of  Monaco  urges  you  to  give
thought to this, in other words, to plan for the adoption
of a legal instrument which will make it possible here,
to  react  against  the  impunity  which  continues  to

The  President  (spoke  in  French):  I  now  call  on
His  Excellency  Mr.  Abdullah  G(cid:252)l,  Deputy  Prime
Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey.
Mr.  G(cid:252)l  (Turkey):  I  would  like  to  start  by
congratulating  you,  Sir,  on  your  election  as  President
of  the  General  Assembly  at  its  fifty-ninth  session.  I
pledge  the  full  support  of  my  delegation  for  your
endeavours.  I  would  also  like  to  pay  tribute  to  your
predecessor,  His  Excellency  Mr.  Julian  Hunte  for  his
able presidency.
We are world leaders at a time when our globe is
undergoing  an  important  phase  of  adaptation  to  new
realities, opportunities and challenges.
As the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi
Annan,  frequently  states,  we  now  possess  the  know-
how to address our common concerns. The Millennium
Summit,  which  was  the  largest  gathering  of  world
leaders,  produced  a  historical  document  (cid:151) 
the
Millennium  Declaration  (cid:151)  which  charts  the  right
course for humanity in the new millennium.
that 
The  goals 
the  Millennium  Declaration
defined  for  humanity  are  ambitious,  yet  achievable.
Reducing  hunger  and  extreme  poverty,  spreading
universal primary education, halting infectious diseases
and  reducing  child  mortality  within  15  years  continue
to be urgent tasks.
Universal  humanitarian  challenges  and  chronic
political-military  conflicts  are  compounded  with  new
and  asymmetrical  threats  such  as  terrorism,  narcotic
drugs, organized crime, the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction and environmental problems.
On 
the  other  hand, 
racism,  anti-Semitism,
prejudicial  attitudes  against  the  tenets  of  certain  creeds
and cultures, among them those of Islam, and xenophobia
add fuel to those menaces. In addition, the special and
urgent  needs  of  the  African  continent  continue  to
require a collective response.
The United Nations system should be encouraged to
intensify its role in addressing those issues. Confidence in
the  international  order  and  in  international  institutions
should not be undermined. A more effective and credible
United  Nations  would  be  better  able  to  face  the
common  challenges  of  today.  The  Security  Council
should  have  a  more  representative  and  balanced
character;  indeed,  representation  in  the  Council  must
be inclusive  and  fair. That will increase its  legitimacy
and  efficiency.  In  that  respect,  I  would  like  to
commend the efforts of the Secretary-General.
The  correlation  between  good  governance  and
peace  and  prosperity  is  valid  both  domestically  and
internationally.  Therefore,  a  global  agenda  for  reform
should  cover  all  aspects  of  domestic  and  international
life. Each member of the international community has
a stake in, and responsibility for, the implementation of
such an agenda.
and 
our 
deepened 
democracy 
On  our  part,  my  Government,  fully  conscious  of
that correlation, has carried out sweeping political and
economic reforms in the past two years. We have thus
upgraded 
and
consolidated  an  accountable,  transparent  and  efficient
administration  and  a  dynamic  civil  society  upholding
the rule of law and human rights. The expectations of
our people, as well as the relevant United Nations and
European  Union  standards,  inspired  us  in  our  reform
drive. I take pride in the fact that many observers, both
in the west and in the east, have seen in our experience
the  perfect  embodiment  of  modernity,  progress,
identity and tradition.
I  should  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  confirm
Turkey(cid:146)s  candidacy  for  a  non-permanent  seat  in  the
Security Council for the term 2009-2010. In spite of its
substantial contributions to peace and security, Turkey
has not been a member of the Council for almost half a
century.  Therefore  we  rightfully  expect  the  support  of
the General Assembly for our candidacy.
Our bid for a non-permanent seat is in tune with
Turkey(cid:146)s  larger  efforts  to  secure  peace,  stability  and
security  in  its  region  and  beyond.  Turkey  figures
prominently in humanitarian activities, from Palestine to
Darfur. We have been contributing increasing numbers to
international  peacekeeping  missions  whose  geographical
distribution ranges from Bosnia to Afghanistan.
Turkey has a unique position as the only member
of  the  Organization  of  the  Islamic  Conference  that  is
also  a  candidate  for  membership  in  the  European
Union. That position enables us to facilitate interaction
and dialogue between the Islamic world and the West.
Turkey  has  numerous  achievements  to  its  credit
in  the  process  of  helping  to  create  an  environment
conducive to development, stability and progress in our
region  and  beyond.  The  Black  Sea  Economic
Cooperation,  the  Economic  Cooperation  Organization
and the Stability Pact are good examples to that effect.
A/59/PV.8
My  Government  has  been  taking  a  peaceful  and
problem-solving  approach  to  world  affairs.  On  the
chronic 
issue  of  Cyprus,  my  Government  fully
supported  Secretary-General  Kofi  Annan(cid:146)s  good-
offices  mission,  and  we  cooperated  closely  with  him.
The Secretary-General(cid:146)s settlement plan was the result
of  four  years  of  serious  negotiations  between  the  two
sides.  They  were  conducted  on  the  basis  of  a  new
bi-zonal  partnership  with  a  federal  Government  and
two  constituent  States.  The  plan  was  put  to  separate
referendums,  with  the  prior  agreement  of  all  parties
concerned.  The  Annan  plan  was  overwhelmingly
accepted  by  the  Turkish  Cypriots,  but  the  Greek
Cypriot leadership chose to reject it.
Mr.  Sevilla  Somoza  (Nicaragua),  Vice-President,
took the Chair.
I profoundly regret the fact that an opportunity to
resolve  the  longstanding  problem  of  Cyprus  was  thus
missed. As a result, a chance to grant fresh credibility
to  the  United  Nations  was  lost.  A  possible  source  of
inspiration  for  peacemakers  elsewhere,  in  the  Middle
East or the Caucasus, also disappeared.
in  his  report 
The  Secretary-General, 
the
Security  Council,  clearly  stated  that  the  referendums
drastically  changed  the  situation  on  the  island.  It
confirmed, once again, the existence of two equal peoples
and their separate rights to decide their own fate.

Turkey remains committed to a lasting settlement
in Cyprus. Five months have passed since the Turkish
Cypriots,  responding  to  the  call  of  the  international
community, voted courageously in favour of the United
Nations  plan.  However,  they  have  yet  to  be  rewarded
for expressing their will to reunify the island. We urge
the  Security  Council  positively  to  respond  to  the
Secretary-General(cid:146)s  call.  We  also  appeal  to  United
Nations  Member  States  to  take  concrete  steps,  at  the
bilateral  level,  to  put  an  end  to  the  isolation  and
punishment  of  the  people  of  the  Turkish  Republic  of
Northern Cyprus.

Turkey  has  been  strongly  supporting,  and  will
continue  to  support,  the  preservation  of  peace  and
stability in south-east Europe.
We are glad to note that considerable progress has
been  achieved  in  this  region  thanks  to  the  sustained
efforts  of  the  international  community  and  of  the
Balkan countries themselves.
Turkey is determined to sustain the promising and
constructive  atmosphere  in  our  relations  with  Greece.
We  hope  that  the  improvement  in  bilateral  relations
will  continue  in  the  coming  period.  Our  wide-ranging
cooperation  is  expanding  in  every  field.  That  will
facilitate  the  settlement  of  all  pending  issues.  It  will
also result in a climate of cooperation beneficial to the
two countries, as well as peace, stability and security in
the region as a whole.
towards  eliminating 
Turkey believes that it is high time to start taking
concrete  steps 
the  existing
(cid:147)frozen(cid:148)  conflicts  in  the  southern  Caucasus,  such  as
those 
in  Nagorno-Karabakh,  Abkhazia  and  South
Ossetia.  As  a  neighbouring  country,  we  are  actively
contributing to efforts aimed at achieving stability and
prosperity  in  that  region.  To  that  end,  we  have  been
encouraging all the parties concerned while facilitating
the  ongoing  process  of  dialogue.  We  hope  that  the
Abkhazian  conflict  and the problems  in  South  Ossetia
will  be  overcome  by  peaceful  means,  within  the
framework  of  the  territorial  integrity  and  sovereignty
of Georgia.
My  Government  supports  a  just  and  lasting
solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict on the basis
of  the  fundamental  principles  of  international  law,  the
territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and good-neighbourly
relations. We expect the Armenian Government to fully
comply with the relevant United Nations resolutions to
reach such a solution.
The Middle East problem and the situation in Iraq
and Afghanistan are the major conflicts responsible for
compounding instability in the world and are leading to
increasingly serious consequences.
The road map is the only available framework for
a  comprehensive  settlement  of  the  Israeli-Palestinian
problem.  Benefiting  from  its  traditional  ties  with  the
parties,  Turkey  has  already  offered 
its  active
contribution to the implementation of the road map. We
also  support  every  effort 
initiated  and
coordinated in that context.

We  join  the  call  made  by  the  Quartet  yesterday.
The resumption of the negotiating process between the
two  parties  should  remain  the  central  objective  of
current efforts. It is important, likewise, that both sides
fulfil their performance criteria as laid out in the road
map.  Terrorist  attacks  against  the  Israeli  people  must
stop.  So  must  the  deliberate  destruction  of  Palestinian
lives  and  properties.  The  process  of  the  reform  of
Palestinian 
institutions  must  be  advanced.  Israeli
settlement  activities  must  be  immediately  halted.  The
ruling  of  the  International  Court  of  Justice  must  be
respected. And the living conditions of the Palestinians
need to be urgently improved.
Any  settlement  would  be  incomplete  without
progress on all tracks, including those involving Syria
and Lebanon.
My Government is focused on contributing to the
improvement of the situation in Iraq. We appreciate the
massive  resources  and  political  efforts  mobilized  by
the  United  States  Administration  and  the  international
community for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of
Iraq. We sincerely hope those efforts yield the desired
results  soon.  However,  the  humanitarian,  political  and
security  difficulties  faced  by  the  people  of  Iraq
continue  to  adversely  affect  one  another.  It  goes
without  saying  that  developments  in  Iraq  are  also
affecting  my  country  and  causing  suffering  for  my
people, while, as we are a neighbouring country, most
of  Iraq(cid:146)s  humanitarian  needs  are  being  supplied
through Turkey.
The  Iraqi  transition  is  not  only  about  the  fate  of
the  Iraqi  nation.  It  is  about  the  future  of  peace  and
prosperity  in  the  whole  region  and  beyond.  That  is  the
motive  for  Turkey(cid:146)s  strong  support  of  a  united,
territorially intact and democratic Iraq (cid:151) an Iraq that is at
peace  with  itself  and  with  its  neighbours.  That  should
and can only be achieved with the full participation and
support  of  the  Iraqi  people  as  a  whole.  More  United
Nations  involvement  would  facilitate  that  task.  The
series of neighbouring countries meetings, initiated by
Turkey,  is  also  a  valuable  instrument  to  be  taken  into
account.  After  all,  as  Iraq(cid:146)s  success  will  be  our
collective  success,  so  its  failure  will  also  be  a
collective failure. For its part, Turkey will continue to
support  the  Iraqi  interim  Government(cid:146)s  efforts  in
paving the way to normalcy and democracy.

is  a  crime  against  humanity.  We  condemn  those

As  a  country 
long  suffered  from
terrorism, Turkey calls for more intensified multilateral
cooperation.  The  United  Nations  system 
is  an
important  platform  in  that  respect  and  we  extend  our
full support to efforts under its aegis.
We  also  strongly  believe  in  the  urgent  need  to
strengthen  the  control  regimes  for  weapons  of  mass
destruction  and 
their  delivery  systems.  We  will
continue  to  support  ongoing  work  to  ensure  full
adherence  to  the  legal  instruments  in  that  field.  The
creation  of  nuclear-weapon-free  zones  is  an  important
way  of  strengthening  peace  and  security  in  the  world
and in all regions, including the Middle East.
Turkey  is  determined  to  use  every  effort  and
deploy  all  the  means  at  its  disposal  in  order  to
strengthen  peace  and  stability  in  its  immediate  region
and  beyond.  We  will  try  to  use  the  influence  of  our
multidimensional  ties  and  deep-rooted  relations  to
achieve  that  goal.  We  remain  strongly  committed  to
translating  into  reality  the  universal  validity  of  the
noble  values  and  principles  enshrined  in  the  United
Nations Charter.

counter-terrorism and is working to promote the whole
range  of  United  Nations  action  against  terrorism.  In
Vienna, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
and its Terrorism Prevention Branch make an important
contribution by rendering assistance to Member States

The  United  Nations  continues  to  play  a  key  role
in  South-Eastern  Europe,  especially  in  Kosovo.  We
welcome  the  recent  appointment  of  Mr.  S≈Çren  Jessen-
Petersen as Special Representative for Kosovo. In that
regard, within the European Union, the countries of the
regional  partnership  (cid:151)  the  Czech  Republic,  Hungary,
Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and my country, Austria (cid:151)
presented  concrete  proposals  with  regard  to  security,
economic  development,  decentralization  and 
the
protection  of  minorities  and  of  religious  sites.  We  are
confident  that  they  can  contribute  to  progress  in
Kosovo.
International  and  regional  efforts  are  essential  if
we  are  to  contain  and  resolve  the  various  conflicts  in

other  regions  of  the  world.  The  dramatic  situation  in
Darfur highlights the need for better harmonization of the
international efforts of the United Nations, the African
Union, the EU, the  League of  Arab  States,  the  United
States  and  other  actors.  We  will  have  to  examine
carefully the results of the current mission to Darfur of
the new Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide
and the High Commissioner for Human Rights.
Such  missions  and  mechanisms  are  indeed  the
tools that the United Nations needs if it is to effectively
address  emerging  crisis  situations.  Strengthening  the
rule of law, human rights, democratic participation and
economic  development  will  reduce  the  chance  of
conflicts  within  societies  and  among  States  turning
violent.  In  order  to  be  a  credible  player,  the  United
Nations  must  be  given  the  necessary  institutional
framework to enact effective strategies at all stages of
a conflict.
Austria 
therefore  welcomed 
the  Secretary-
General(cid:146)s call for reform, in particular his initiative to
establish  a  High-Level  Panel  of  eminent  persons  to
propose  specific  measures  for  institutional  innovation
by  the  end  of  the  year.  I  was  happy  to  meet  with  the
members  of  the  Panel  when  it  held  its  meeting  in
Austria earlier this year.
One  item  on  the  Panel(cid:146)s  agenda  is  Security
Council  reform.  Austria,  like  many  other  countries,  is
concerned  about 
the
Council(cid:146)s current composition on the one hand, and the
changing  political,  economic  and  social  reality  of  the
community of nations on the other.
the  growing  gap  between 
It 
is  essential 
to  enlarge  and  balance 
the
membership  of  the  Security  Council,  as  well  as  to
increase  its  transparency.  In  order  for  all  peoples  to
identify  with  its  decisions,  we  must  ensure  that  the
Security  Council  is  a  body  that  truly  reflects  the
diversity  of  the  world(cid:146)s  cultures  and  regions  by  an
improved  representation  of  regions  such  as  Africa,
Asia and Latin America.
As you know, Sir, it is my personal vision that, in
the  longer  term,  the  European  Union  should  also  be
represented  in  the  Security  Council.  I  pointed  out
during  the  general  debate  last  year  that  that  would  be
the logical consequence of further European integration
in the field of common foreign and security policy.
The  United  Nations  has  been  at  the  centre  of
Austria(cid:146)s  foreign  policy  since  we  became  a  Member
28
after regaining our full independence in 1955. We have
always strongly supported  the  principles  and  purposes
of the United Nations, and we remain committed to the
goals of the Charter.
Austria feels honoured and privileged to host one
of  the  headquarters  of  the  United  Nations.  This  year,
we celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of  the  opening
of the Vienna International Centre, home to many United
Nations  institutions.  The  work  of  the  International
Atomic Energy Agency and the Preparatory Committee
of 
the  Comprehensive  Nuclear-Test-Ban  Treaty
Organization with respect to nuclear non-proliferation;
the work of the United Nations Industrial Development
Organization  on  development  cooperation;  and  the
fight against the so-called uncivil society by the United
Nations  Office  on  Drugs  and  Crime,  contribute
substantially to the international community(cid:146)s efforts to
confront the world(cid:146)s new security threats.
In this spirit of full and honest commitment to the
United Nations, I would like to recall that Austria is a
candidate  for  a  non-permanent  seat  on  the  Security
Council  for  the  term  2009-2010.  Our  candidature,
announced over five years ago  (cid:151) in 1999 (cid:151) is based
on  our  willingness 
to  contribute  actively  and
constructively  to  the  maintenance  of  international
peace  and  security.  We  fully  recognize  the  heavy
responsibility  which  Security  Council  membership
entails and we are ready to assume it.
Over  the  past  50  years,  Austria  has  sought  to
contribute effectively to the work of the United Nations,
in  particular  in  the  fields  of  peace  and  security,  human
rights,  development,  disarmament  and  international
law. We are a significant contributor to United Nations
peacekeeping  operations  and  have  traditionally  been
among  the  largest  European  troop  contributors.  Since
1963, over 50,000 Austrians have served in more than
50 United Nations missions worldwide.
Security, as we see it, means human security. It is
the kind of security that  all human beings are looking
for, among them millions of civilians in all parts of the
world  affected  by  armed  conflict  (cid:151)  the  majority  of
them  women  and  children  (cid:151)  and  40  million  people
living  with  the  HIV  virus.  Human  security  transcends
the  concept  of  hard  threats  and  soft  threats.  If  we  see
those  threats  through  the  prism  of  the  human  beings
concerned,  it  becomes  clear  that  for  the  afflicted
individual, all such threats (cid:151) war, hunger, terrorism or
deadly disease (cid:151) deprive them of their security.
Austria  is  honoured  to  chair  the  first  Review
Conference  of  States  Parties  to  the  Anti-personnel
Mine-Ban Convention in Nairobi later this year, where
the international community will chart a course for the
solution of the landmine problem in the coming years.
The Mine-Ban Convention has become a true example
of  a  successful  and  effective  multilateral  approach  to
address  a  global  problem.  I  encourage  all  States  to
participate  at  the  Nairobi  Summit  at  the  highest
possible level.
As a member of the Human Security Network, we
cooperate with others to promote human security in the
world.  To  provide  one  concrete  example,  Austria  (cid:151)
together  with  Slovenia  and  Jordan  (cid:151)  initiated  and
funded an aid project for traumatized children in Iraq. I
am  convinced 
that  applying  a  human  security
perspective to international problems  has the potential
of  preventing  or  resolving  conflict  and  promoting
peace and development.
We  also  need  to  reflect  further  on  how  best  to
ensure respect for human rights during conflict, how to
incorporate  human  rights  into  preventive  policies  and
how  to  formulate  post-conflict  strategies  likely  to
achieve lasting reconciliation and build a firm basis for
the  rule  of  law  and  good  governance.  In  that  respect,
human  rights  education  is  an  important  element  in
getting to the root of conflict and breaking the vicious
circle of human rights violations.
to 
tends 
Violence  between  ethnic  groups  and  religious
communities has shaken countries across the globe. In
particular, the disregard for the needs and the rights of
minorities 
fuel  violent  conflict.  Our
endeavours for the protection of the rights of minorities
are  still  highly  needed,  not  the  least  to  ensure  that
ethnic  cleansing  or  genocide  will  never  happen  again.
We know that the Secretary-General feels very strongly
about the need for speed of action to prevent the most
heinous crimes. I share his concerns.
The  Austrian  Government  is  convinced  that  it  is
an essential responsibility of the United Nations and its
Member  States  to  address  the  root  causes  of  conflict.
Global  poverty,  inequality,  competition  for  scarce
resources, environmental degradation and the spread of
infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, are among the
ingredients  that  fuel  the  outbreak  of  conflicts  both
within countries and among States.
The  Austrian  Development  Policy  has  placed  a
particular  focus  on  poverty  reduction,  maintenance  of
A/59/PV.8
peace  and  the  protection  of  the  environment.  I  am
pleased  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  Austria  has
increased its development aid by 35 per cent this year.
In the area of environment and sustainable energy, we
have  initiated  and  promoted  the  Global  Forum  for
Sustainable Energy, which aims at providing access to
energy for people in developing countries. We consider
issues  such  as  climate  change, 
the  decline  of
biodiversity  and  other 
forms  of  environmental
degradation  as  essential  aspects  of  our  comprehensive
security agenda.
Let  me  finally  highlight  an  issue  which  the
Secretary-General made a central theme of his address
to  the  General  Assembly.  The  key  guarantee  for
creating  and  maintaining  peace  and  security  in  the
world has been and will continue to be an international
system based on the rule of law. This was the very idea
of the founders of the United Nations.
I  particularly  welcome  the  Secretary-General(cid:146)s
pledge  two  days  ago  that  he  will  make  the  United
Nations  work  to  strengthen  the  rule  of  law  and
transitional 
in  conflict  and  post-conflict
societies  a  priority  for  the  remainder  of  his  tenure.
Particularly for smaller and medium sized countries, an
international  order  based  on  the  rule  of  law  is  of
paramount importance.
justice 
With this in mind, I would like to announce today
that  I  have  launched  a  discourse  on  the  role  and
function  of  the  Security  Council  in  strengthening  a
rules-based  international  system.  As  a  first  step,  we
will  organize  in  November  a  panel  of  international
legal  experts  during  International  Law  Week  at
Headquarters,  which  will  analyse  the  increasing  law-
making tendency of the Security Council.
This  is  my  last  speech  as  Austrian  Foreign
Minister.  As  you  may  know,  I  have  been  nominated
Commissioner  of  the  European  Union  for  External
Relations  and  European  Neighbourhood  Policy.  This
function will, of course, keep me in close contact with
many Assembly delegates and with the United Nations.
I would therefore like to use this opportunity today to
thank  all  colleagues,  members  of  delegations  and,  in
particular,  the  Secretariat,  in  which  I  myself  had  the
honour to work, for the support that has been extended
to  me  and  my  staff  here  in  New  York  over  the  past
years. A special and warm expression of gratitude and
respect  goes  to  Secretary-General  Kofi  Annan.  To  the
President  of  the  Assembly,  I  would  like  to  extend  my

Beslan.  I  would  like  from  this  rostrum  to  take  this
opportunity  to  express  once  again  my  gratitude  to  all
those  who  have  shown  their  solidarity  with  Russia  in
these tragic days. Our special thanks go to the States and

themselves 
Russia  has  drawn  harsh  conclusions.  They  have
been set forth in the 4 and 13 September addresses by
the  President  of  the  Russian  Federation,  Vladimir  V.
Putin.  We  will  not  allow  anyone  to  encroach  on  the
sovereignty of our State. We will resolutely strengthen
the  unity  of  the  country  and  its  people  in  order  to
counter terror and to guarantee a secure and decent life
for our citizens in freedom and democracy.

Constitution;  and  we  will  continue  to  defend  our
legitimate  interests  throughout  the  world,  not  through
confrontation,  but  by  means  of  equitable  dialogue,
cooperation  and  partnership.  Moreover,  a  readiness  to
engage  in  honest  cooperation  in  fighting  terrorism
without  double  standards,  is  becoming  one  of  the  key
criteria in our relations with any and all States.
We must enter into a qualitatively new and critical
stage  in  the  activities  of  the  anti-terrorist  coalition.  The

the 
strong  determination  of 
the  Security  Council  of  1  September
meeting  of 
demonstrated 
the
international  community  to  continue  its  fight  against
terrorism  in  a  consistent  way.  It  is  important  now  to
translate  this  commitment  into  practical  actions  as
quickly as possible.
In  the  three  years  that  have  passed  since  the
terrorist  attacks  in  New  York  City  and  Washington,  a
lot  has  been  done  to  develop  effective  partnership  in
this  sphere.  However,  compared  to  the  scale  of  the
threat, far from enough has been done. It is important
to  learn  lessons  from  the  experience  gained  and  to
draw conclusions for the future.
First, the global nature of the terrorist threat testifies
to  the  fact  that  security  in  today(cid:146)s  world  is  indivisible.
Consequently,  only  collective  responsibility  can  make
the  world  secure.  The  fight  against  terrorism  should
unite States rather than pit them against each other. We
can  deal  with  this  evil  only  on  a  multilateral  basis  by
combining our efforts and acting in the spirit of solidarity.
As  President  Putin  has  declared,  Russia  considers  the
objective of strengthening the anti-terrorist coalition to
be one of our most important tasks.
A  special  emphasis  here  should  be  placed  on
intensifying  the  cooperation  among  our  special  services,
which,  we  are  convinced,  must  now  be  raised  to  a
qualitatively new level of trust and coordinated action.
Secondly,  a  clear  strategy  and  a  generally
acceptable  legal  framework  are  the  prerequisites  for
success  in  combating  terrorism.  Such  a  framework  is
enshrined  in  resolution  1373  (2001)  and  in  other
decisions of the Security Council. But now, additional
efforts  are  needed.  They  include  making  necessary
amendments 
to
international  anti-terrorist  conventions  and  finalizing
new international counter-terrorism legal instruments.
legislation,  acceding 
to  national 
In  circumstances  where  international  terrorism
has  declared  war  on  our  entire  civilization, 
the
determination  of  States  to  use  their  right  of  self-
defence  in  conformity  with  Article  51  of  the  United
Nations Charter is of particular importance. Of course
international  law  is  clearly  not  an  inalterable  dogma.
The  fight  against  terrorism  calls  for  its  development
and improvement.
Thirdly,  the  time  has  come  to  renounce  double
standards  once  and  for  all  when  it  comes  to  terror,
regardless  of  the  slogans  in  which  it  may  be  cloaked.
Those who slaughtered children in Beslan and hijacked
aeroplanes to attack America are creatures of the same
ilk.
Harbouring  terrorists,  their  henchmen  and  their
sponsors  undermines  unity  and  mutual  trust  among
those that form part of the anti-terrorist front, serves as
justification  for  the  actions  of  terrorists  and  indeed
encourages  them  to  commit  similar  crimes  in  other
countries. I would recall that United Nations decisions
require  States  granting  political  asylum  to  carefully
examine  the  personal  records  of  each  individual  to
make  sure  that  he  or  she  has  no  links  to  terrorism.
Attempts  to  use  the  fight  against  terrorism  in  various
geopolitical  games  are  even  more  counterproductive
and dangerous.
Fourth,  the  utter  atrociousness  of  the  recent
terrorist  attacks  proves  there  is  the  need  for  reliable
safeguards against terrorists gaining access to weapons
of mass destruction. Russia is prepared for the closest
kind  of  international  partnership  in  that  area.  Our
country  was  one  of  the  sponsors  of  Security  Council
resolution  1540  (2004).  It  is  a  participant  in  the
Proliferation Security Initiative and a co-sponsor of the
Group  of  Eight 
(G-8)  Action  Plan  on  Non-
Proliferation. Those initiatives are complementary and
are designed to increase the effectiveness of the regime of
the  non-proliferation  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction,
something which is especially relevant on the eve of the
2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).
Fifth, drug trafficking is increasingly interwoven
with  terrorism.  The  drug  flow  from  Afghanistan  has
acquired  global  significance.  The  implementation  of  a
set of social, economic and law-enforcement measures
both  within  and  outside  the  borders  of  that  country  is
now more urgent than ever. One of the key elements of
that strategy lies in strengthening the existing anti-drug
security belts and creating new ones.
Russia 
is  making  an 
formulation  of  specific 
important  contribution
towards resolving the drug problem, including through
the 
legal,  political  and
operational  measures  within  the  framework  of  the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Collective
Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). We are ready to
coordinate

of  extremism  of  any  kind.  There  is  a  need  for
respectful  dialogue  among  various  religions  and

and to the East, is ready to play its part in that process,

Seventh, Russia believes that the United Nations
must  continue  to  play  a  pivotal  role  in  uniting  the
efforts  of  the  international  community  in  its  fight
against  terrorism.  As  Chair  of  the  Security  Council(cid:146)s
Counter-Terrorism  Committee  (CTC),  our  country
intends to actively contribute to speeding up the reform
of that Committee. We propose drafting a new Security
Council resolution that would ensure the most effective
possible functioning of the CTC, so as to identify, in a
timely  manner,  weak

network and increase practical cooperation between the
CTC  and  international  and  regional  organizations,

assistance  towards  attaining  a  political  settlement
aimed  at  preserving  Iraq(cid:146)s  territorial  integrity  and
ensuring  its  political  sovereignty  and  a  genuinely
democratic  post-war  recovery.  The  search  for  national
reconciliation  within  Iraq  is  of  key  significance;  here,
the  Iraqis  could  be  assisted  by  the  holding  of  an
international  conference  with  the  participation  of  all
major  Iraqi  political  forces,  friendly  States,  Security
Council  members  and  the  League  of  Arab  States  and
other organizations.
We  must  remain  vigilant  with  regard  to  Kosovo,
which  is  a  dangerous  hotbed  of  tension.  There  is  no
room  for  complacency.  We  must  work  to  ensure  that
universally  recognized  standards  of  human  rights  and
the  rights  of  national  minorities  are  applied  in  the
region.  We  also  need  to  make  full  use  of  existing
mechanisms for conflict settlement within the CIS.
Consolidating  the  peacemaking  capacity  of  the
international  community  is  crucial  to  overcoming
regional  crises.  A  collective  response  to  humanitarian
crises,  in  particular  those  on  the  African  continent,  in
full compliance with the United Nations Charter and in
a  spirit  of  partnership  with  regional  structures,  would
leave  no  doubt  that  the  Charter  remains  a  universal
basis for the effective solution of such problems.
The  United  Nations  must  continue  to  focus  its
attention  on  other  global  threats  to  security  and
sustainable  development  as  well.  Those  include  the
eradication  of  poverty  and  illiteracy  as  a  breeding
ground  for  extremism.  Annually,  our  country  grants
1,000 scholarships to students from African  countries.
Russia has contributed $7.5 million to the Global Fund
to  Fight  AIDS,  Tuberculosis  and  Malaria  and  has
provided bilateral humanitarian assistance to a number
of African countries.
Among  the  challenges  and  threats  is  that  of
finding ways to bridge  the  gap  between  poor  and  rich
States.  Russia  has  been  making  its  contribution  there;
between 1998 and 2002 it wrote off the debt of African
countries equivalent to $11.2 billion.

transformation  of  outer  space  into  a  theatre  of  armed
confrontation. Together with China, we are calling for the
conclusion of a comprehensive agreement to that end. We
call upon all countries with space capability to join in that
initiative.  There  is  also  a  growing  need  to  elaborate  a
United Nations convention on outer space law.
A  further  challenge  is  the  fight  against  gross
violations of human rights, with a view to ensuring the
security  and  dignity  of  the  individual.  The  United
Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in  Europe, 
the  Council  of  Europe  and  other
organizations  should  not  remain  passive  spectators
when,  in  some  countries,  a  considerable  part  of  the
population is deprived of citizenship and consequently
of basic political, social and economic rights.
On  Russia(cid:146)s  initiative,  the  General  Assembly,  at
its  fifty-seventh  and  fifty-eighth  sessions,  adopted
resolutions  57/145  and  58/16 
respectively,  on
establishing,  under  the  aegis  of  the  United  Nations,  a
comprehensive approach to countering new threats and
challenges. The resolutions contain specific guidelines
for  bringing  the  international  community  closer  to  a
new  security  model  that  would  meet  the  global
challenges of the twenty-first century.
Those  are  the  lines  along  which  the  High-level
Panel  on  Threats,  Challenges  and  Change,  established
by  the  Secretary-General,  is  organizing  its  work.  We
hope that its recommendations will pave the way for a
genuine enhancement of the effectiveness of the United
Nations. At the same time, reform of the Organization,
and  particularly  of  the  Security  Council,  should  be
based  on  the  broadest  possible  agreement  and  should
not provoke the alienation of States.
The  international  community  is  undergoing  a
complex period in its establishment of a new system of
international relations. It is already clear that this will
be  a  long-term  process  with  an  uncertain  future  and
one that, so far, is difficult to predict. At the same time,
there  is  an  enormous  increase  in  the  number  of  new
unresolved problems and new dangerous challenges to
security and the development of mankind. We still lack
a  collective  strategy  and  universally  applicable
mechanisms for responding to those challenges. In fact,
we  have  to  constantly  improvise  and  use  makeshift
means to ensure world stability.
A  question  arises  as  to  whether  we  could  soon
find ourselves in a situation in which events start to go
out  of  control.  Is  it  not  time  for  the  international
community to assume an active role in impacting upon
global  processes  and 
to
establish a more secure and just world order? Russia is
fully  determined,  together  with  other  countries,  to
build  such  a  world  order  and  take  its  proper  place
therein as a free and democratic State.

More than half a century ago, the civilized world
put aside all its disputes and differences and mobilized
its  efforts  to  counter  the  deadly  threat  of  Nazi
enslavement.  The  enemy  that  opposes  us  today  is  no
less dangerous and no less merciless. Russia sincerely
hopes  that  the  forthcoming  sixtieth  anniversary  of  the

Mr.  Straw  (United  Kingdom):  Mr.  President,  I
offer  my  congratulations  and  those  of  my  country  on
your election as President  of the General Assembly at
its fifty-ninth session.
Eighteen  months  ago,  the  United  Nations  faced
divisions  more  serious  than  any  since  the  Cuban
missile crisis of October 1962. We all worried whether
the strength and unity which we had built up since the
end of the cold war could survive.
Then last year we watched, as Secretary-General
Kofi Annan stood at his now famous fork in the road.
In the year since, almost instinctively, we have decided
to  follow  our  Secretary-General(cid:146)s  directions.  This
Organization has not been plunged, as some predicted,
into  paralysis;  instead,  I  have  felt  a  powerful  if
unspoken  determination  to  make  the  United  Nations
work, and to work more effectively, to fulfil its central
task: to secure peace around the world.
A/59/PV.8
Over the last 12 months we have dealt with new
crises  such  as  that  in  Darfur  in  the  Sudan,  where  we
have set clear tasks for both the Sudanese Government
and the rebel groups. We have tackled the situation in
the  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo  and  the  Great
Lakes;  mobilized  international  support  for  the  new
Iraq;  and  addressed  a  long  list  of  hugely  important
subjects which rarely receive the coverage they should
in 
the  media  (cid:151)  Haiti,  Georgia,  Timor-Leste,
Bougainville and Western Sahara.
We  have  shown  in  those  actions  the  unity  of
purpose  which  is  one  of  the  strongest  weapons  in  our
hands to defeat the evils which today affect the globe.
And the search for consensus has not been confined to
the Security Council.
I  am  proud  that  just  a  few  months  after  the
difficult times of early last year, France, Germany and
the  United  Kingdom  came  together  to  work,  as  we

I  recognize,  of  course,  the  frustrations  which  all
of  us  feel,  not  least  over  the  Israel-Palestine  conflict,
where  the  clear  path  to  peace  set  out  in  the  road  map
and endorsed by the Security Council remains elusive.
But all in all we have shown the will to make collective
action work, though we know, too, that we need to go
further.
In  particular,  we  need  to  get  better  at  tackling
threats  which  have  changed  dramatically  since  the
founding  of  the  United  Nations.  Today  the  greatest
threats  to  our  security  often  come  not  from  other
functioning  sovereign  States,  but 
terrorist
organizations,  from  failing  States  and  from  man-made
shocks to  our environment like  climate change, which
can  exacerbate  State

the  Secretary-General 
The High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and
Change  appointed  by 
is
preparing its recommendations on ways to address the
various challenges. We should remember in all this that
we  have  one  great  advantage.  Though  its  institutions
and  the  founding  text  of  the  Charter  has  hardly
changed  in  60  years,  the  United  Nations  is  not  an
organization set in stone, but a set of living institutions
based  on  a  shared  will  to  make  collective  security
work.  The  United  Nations  has  adapted  in  the  past  (cid:151)

the future.

Of course, institutional change is part of that. At

members  could  expect  to  be  elected  members  of  the
Security  Council  at  any  one

proportion  is  less  than  one  eighteenth.  The  United

two  countries  which  between 
But  we  should  not  see  an  expansion  of  the
Security  Council,  or  other  institutional  change,  as  a
panacea.  The  biggest  need  is  to  adapt  our  common
understanding  (cid:151)  the  United  Nations  jurisprudence,  if
you like (cid:151) and its operational effectiveness so that we
can  respond  more  quickly  and  more  thoroughly  to
today(cid:146)s new threats.
Let  me  highlight  three  areas  which  to  me  seem
particularly  important:  first,  our  approach  must  be
broader and must tackle threats to the most vulnerable,
including 
environmental
degradation; secondly, we must build a new consensus by
expanding the scope of collective action; and, thirdly, we
must deal with the threat of terrorism, which menaces
us all and everything for which we stand.
poverty, 
disease 
and 
Let me now take these three points in turn. First,
there  is  the  need  for  a  broader  approach  which
addresses  the  complex  and  interdependent  nature  of
security  today.  Here,  we  have  to  do  more  to  meet  the
Millennium  Development  Goals  and 
to  promote
sustainable  development,  especially  in  Africa.  We
cannot  have 
security  without  development  or
development without security.
As 
the  Secretary-General  highlighted 
in  his
speech this week, we have to do more to entrench the
rule of law and justice, especially in States recovering
from  conflict.  The  United  Kingdom  will  pursue  work
on  the  Secretary-General(cid:146)s  report  during  its  Security
Council presidency next month.
We  could  also  use  the  United  Nations  better,  to
agree to monitor and help implement globally accepted
norms of good governance.
34
And  we  need  to  act  together  quickly  on  climate
change,  perhaps  the  greatest  long-term  threat  to  our
world  in  terms  of  stability  and  security.  We  have  to
implement  Kyoto  (cid:151)  and  I  greatly  welcome  what  my
colleague, His Excellency Sergey Lavrov had to say on
that today (cid:151) and agree to emission reductions beyond
2012.
My  second  point  is  the  need  to  build  a  new
consensus  on  the  scope  of  collective  action.  We  all
represent independent, sovereign states. But even as we
founded 
that
sovereignty  was  a  trust  in  the  hands  of  a  nation(cid:146)s
government:  there  to  be  respected,  not  abused,  from
either without or within.
the  United  Nations  we  recognized 
The Charter set out arrangements so that an abuse
from without could be dealt with through the inherent
right  of  self-defence  recognized  in  Article  51  of  the
Charter.  But  it  also  said  that  an  abuse  from  within
which  threatens  the  peace  could  and  should  be  dealt
with  by  the  Security  Council,  under  the  powers
enshrined  in  the  other  articles  of  Chapter  VII  of  the
Charter,  and  by  the  many  conventions  concluded
within  the  United  Nations  framework,  including,  for
example,  the  1948  Geneva  Convention.  No  longer  (cid:151)
we  all  said  (cid:151)  could  or  should  the  world  turn  away
from unspeakable barbarities like that of the Holocaust.
But  we  have  not  always  lived  up  to  those  high
expectations,  as  the  tragedies  of  Rwanda  and  Bosnia
ten  years  ago  reminded  us.  Today  we  must  resolve  to
do  so  and  to  engage  in  situations  of  humanitarian
catastrophe  or  grave  violations  of 
international
humanitarian law and to act in the face of other threats
to international peace and security.
The  principle  of  non-interference  has  to  be
qualified  by  a  duty  to  protect,  especially  where
Governments are failing in that duty.
We  therefore  need,  for  example,  to  be  ready  to
support  greater  use  by  the  Secretary-General  of  his
powers under Article 99 of the Charter, to bring threats
to peace to the Security Council(cid:146)s attention. We have to
act quickly in response, because prevention is far better
than  cure.  We  should  look  to  work  more  closely  with
regional  organizations,  as  we  are  doing  with  the
African Union in Darfur. We need more discussion on
the  criteria  as  to  when  the  international  community
might have to intervene with military force in extreme
circumstances. We must  get  better  at  engaging  for  the
in  countries  recovering  from  conflict,

to  protect  citizens  from  abuse  by  States,  not  by
terrorists.
A/59/PV.8
My  third  point  is  the  urgent  need  to  combat
global terrorism, a menace directed at us all. If we have
learned anything in the three years since 11 September
2001 it is that international terrorism is indiscriminate
in its targets and merciless in its hatred. Christian, Jew,
Hindu,  Buddhist,  Sikh,  Muslim,  people  of  no  religion
or  any  religion,  and  of  every  or  no  shade  of  political
opinion,  all  have  died  through  the  terrorists(cid:146)  bullet  or
bomb.
My  friend  Sergey  Lavrov  spoke  eloquently  a
moment  ago  about  the  tears  still  wet  for  the  terrible,
unspeakable  massacre  of  the  young  and  innocent  that
took  place  in  Beslan.  Sergey,  your  tears  are  my  tears;
Russia(cid:146)s  tears  are  the  world(cid:146)s  tears.  We  are  all  in  the
fight against terrorism together.
Today  in  Iraq  we  are  seeing  again  the  depths  to
which  the  terrorists  plumb.  The  vast  majority  of  the
victims  of  terrorism  in  Iraq  are  Iraqis.  Our  thoughts
and  condolences  are  with  the  Government  and  people
of Iraq and with their families. But some of the victims
of  terrorism  in  Iraq  are  foreigners  who  are  helping
Iraqis  to  build  a  more  stable  and  prosperous  country.
One of them is Kenneth Bigley, a British engineer held
hostage  by  terrorists  who  have  already  barbarically
murdered  his  two  American  comrades.  Our  thoughts
and prayers are with their families. We continue to do
all we can to secure Mr. Bigley(cid:146)s release.
I  know  (cid:151)  how  could  I  forget  (cid:151)  that  opinions
have  differed  over  the  rightness  of  the  military  action
taken  in  Iraq  18  months  ago.  But  I  warrant  that  no
nation  is  in  favour  of  the  terrorist  insurgency  now
occurring there. For we all recognize that what is being
attempted by the terrorists in Iraq is an attack both on
the  Iraqi  people  and  on  everything  for  which  the
Organization stands: safety, security and human rights.
We  have  to  come  together  to  defeat  the  terrorists  and
their despicable aims.
The  threat  of  terrorism  confronts  democratic,
properly  functioning  States  with  an  acute  dilemma,
namely, how to fight those who recognize none of the
values  for  which  we  stand  while  remaining  true  to
those  values.  Our  commitments  under  international
conventions  express  many  of  those  values  and  the
importance  that  we  attach  to  them.  But  equally,  those
conventions  cannot  be  allowed 
those
involved  in  terrorism.  The  conventions  were  designed
to  shelter 
The  1951  Convention  relating  to  the  Status  of
Refugees  protects  those  with  a  well-founded  fear  of
persecution. I am proud that the United Kingdom and so
many other nations have offered that protection when and
where  it  was  required.  But  as  the  1951  Convention
itself sets out, asylum is not an unqualified right. It does
not apply  to  anyone  who  has  committed  a  war  crime,  a
crime  against  humanity  or  other  serious  crime;  nor
does it  apply to anyone who  is  guilty  of  acts  contrary
to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.
We must never stoop to the level of the terrorist (cid:151)
to  torture,  mistreatment  or  unjustified  incarceration  (cid:151)
nor  will  any  country  within  the  European  Union  be
party  to  the  return  of  suspects  to  such  conditions,  nor
to  face  the  death  penalty.  But  we  cannot  let  terrorists
exploit  a  protection  designed  for  the  persecuted,  not
the  persecutors.  We  in  the  United  Kingdom  shall
therefore  be  working  closely  with  Russia  on  its
important draft Security Council resolution, to see how
best  we  can  prevent  those  who  commit,  support  and
finance  terrorism  from  sheltering  behind  a  refugee
status  to  which  they  are  not  entitled.  Along  with  the
Russian  Federation  and  other  partners  in  the  Security
Council,  we  also  wish  to  look  at  ways  to  ensure  the
speedier extradition of such individuals.
again 
here 
to 
review 
We,  the  United  Nations,  have  over  the  last  year
begun  to  show  a  new  determination  to  come  together
and to make collective action work. A year from now,
we  will  meet 
the
recommendations  of  the  High-level  Panel  on  Threats,
Challenges  and  Change,  as  well  as  the  Millennium
Development  Goals,  and  to  set  the  United  Nations
agenda  for  the  next  decade.  The  United  Kingdom(cid:146)s
chairmanship  of  the  G-8  next  year  will  focus  on
tackling  climate  change  and  on  Africa,  on  which  the
Independent Commission for Africa will be producing
recommendations  as  to  how  best  we  can  support  the
radical  agenda  for  change  and  development  designed
by  Africa  itself  through  the  New  Partnership  for
Africa(cid:146)s  Development  and  the  African  Union.  Our
presidency of the European Union will help us to lead

renewed  determination  and  political  will  to  make

determined to play its full part in that endeavour.
The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now
call on His Excellency Mr. Brian Cowen, Minister for
Foreign Affairs of Ireland.
Mr.  Cowen  (Ireland):  I  first  addressed 
the
General  Assembly  in  the  year  2000.  The  millennium
year was a time of great hope, reflected in the outcome
of  the  Millennium  Summit.  World  leaders  committed
the peoples of the planet to a new beginning in which
the  dawn  of  the  twenty-first  century  would  mark  a
break  from  the  past,  with  a  new  sharing  of  burdens,
and  a  new  common  dedication  to  peace  and  human
progress.
Today the light of that new dawn is obscured by
the  dark  clouds  of  war,  terror,  ethnic  violence  and
continuing abuse of human rights. Twelve months ago
and again this week, the Secretary-General pointed out
that  the  Organization  is  at  a  fork  in  the  road  and  that
we have to decide on the way forward. Much work has
been undertaken since the Secretary-General laid down
that  challenge.  The  High-level  Panel  on  Threats,
Challenges  and  Change  is  working  on  its  report.  I  am
pleased to recall that the European Union (EU) made a
detailed  submission  to  the  Panel,  drawn  up  during
Ireland(cid:146)s recent presidency of the Union. We also took
a  decision

multilateralism  in  the  Union(cid:146)s  discussions  with  other

to  mainstream 
the 
We  await  the  Panel(cid:146)s  report  and  the  Secretary-
General(cid:146)s  recommendations  that  will  follow.  In  his
address  on  Tuesday,  the  Secretary-General  expressed
the hope that when the heads of State and Government
meet  next  year  to  review  progress  on  the  Millennium
Declaration  they  will  be  ready  to  take  bold  decisions.
They must, because the longer we linger at the fork in
the road, the more difficult will be the road ahead.
We  cannot  afford  to  postpone  action.  More  and
more citizens of the world are questioning whether the
United  Nations  has  the  capacity,  or  even  the  will,  to
prevent  conflict  and  protect 
the  vulnerable  from
injustice. They are becoming increasingly disillusioned
with  an  Organization  which  either  cannot 
take
decisions  or  whose  decisions  are 
ignored  with
impunity. They see  the  politics  of  the  lowest  common
denominator  in  operation,  with  strong  and  sensible
36
draft  resolutions  watered  down  to  mere  platitudes.
They  hear  the  United  Nations  being  denigrated  by
those  who  make  a  virtue  of  their  determination  to  put
national  interests  above  all  other  considerations.  They
fear  that  the  Organization  is  no  longer  driven  by  the
determination and idealism of the founding fathers.
My  Prime  Minister,  Taoiseach  Bertie  Ahern,
made  clear  last  year,  when  he  addressed  the  General
Assembly,  where  the  fault  lies.  It  lies  with  us,  the
Governments of the Member States. We have a strong
and much respected Secretary-General in Kofi Annan.
We have brave and dedicated officials. Many have put
their  lives  on  the  line  for  the  Organization  and  what  it
stands for. Some have made the ultimate sacrifice. United
Nations staff deserve better protection in the future.
It is time for the Governments of Member States
to act. We need, as the Secretary-General put it, to seek
common  solutions  to  common  problems.  That  will
require  political  will  and  effective  structures.  Neither
one on its own will suffice. The  essential  requirement
is a more effective system of collective security. Such a
system  requires  the  unique  legitimacy  offered  by  an
effective United Nations and its Charter.

geopolitical  realities.  In  Ireland(cid:146)s  view,  a  modest  and
regionally balanced increase in its membership, both in
the  permanent  and  non-permanent  categories, 
is
justified. Increased representation from the developing
world  would  enhance  its  legitimacy,  and  thereby  its
effectiveness.
But  a  more  effective  Security  Council  will  need
more  than  a  change  in  structures.  There  has  to  be  a
change in attitudes. Those States that sit on the Security
Council  have  a  responsibility  to  rise  above  national  or
regional  interests  and  act  in  the  wider  interests  of
mankind.  That  is  an  obligation  that  rests  on  each  and
every  member  of  the  Council.  But  those  who  either
assert or aspire to positions of world leadership (cid:151) and
there is no shortage of  candidates  (cid:151)  bear a particular
responsibility to act in the global interest.
Putting  national  interests  first  is  not  an  effective
answer to the challenges that confront us. It may be a
clich√ò to say that our planet is shrinking, but that does
not make it any less true. While most of us continue to

Ireland  fully  recognizes  the  seriousness  of  the
shortfall in development funding that faces us, which is
presently  estimated  at  (cid:128)50  billion  per  year.  The  best
means  of  bridging  that  gap  is  for  donor  nations  to
recommit  themselves  to  reaching  the  United  Nations
target  for  official  development  assistance  of  0.7  per
cent  of  gross  national  product.  The  Irish  Government
remains  committed  to  that  goal.  Ireland,  which  has
increased  its  official  development  assistance  very
substantially  in  recent  years,  will  continue  working
actively with its developing country partners to build a
strong global partnership for development.
Economic  and  social  development  is  the  means
by which the world(cid:146)s poorer countries can be lifted out
of poverty. An open international trading regime aimed
at  facilitating  investment  is  an  integral  part  of  our
multilateral  system,  and  fair  market  access  is  an
essential  part  of  that.  Some  developing  countries
estimate  that,  in  a  best-case  scenario,  a  successful
outcome to the Doha Round could help raise up to 500
million  people  out  of  extreme  poverty.  Fairer
international trading arrangements are imperative if we
are  to  address  the  problems  of  underdevelopment.
Ireland and its European Union partners are determined
not  to  be  found  wanting  in  the  task  of  bringing  the
Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, finally,
to  a  conclusion,  with  an  agreement  that  meets  the
essential concerns of all sides.
Over the past year we have once again seen that
the  failure  of  State  institutions  is  a  major  source  of
A/59/PV.8
conflict  and  human  misery.  The  responsibility  for
protecting  people  from  conflict  and  the  effects  of
conflict,  and  from  humanitarian  catastrophe, 
lies
primarily  with  the  Governments  concerned.  However,
it  has  been  well  demonstrated  that  events  within  a
particular country can threaten international peace and
security  and  spread  misery  far  beyond  its  borders.
Where Governments are unable or unwilling to take the
necessary  steps  to  prevent  catastrophe  in  their  own
country, I believe that the international community has
responsibilities to protect in those circumstances.
It  is  increasingly  evident  that  instability  very
frequently  arises  from  situations  where  human  rights
are abused or denied. The abuse of human rights is also
at  the  root  of  poverty  and  underdevelopment.  Respect
for  human  rights,  on  the  other  hand,  is  an  essential
element of good governance, and must be at the centre
of  efforts  to  prevent  conflict,  and  of  post-conflict
reconstruction.  Presently,  40  per  cent  of  conflicts  that
appear  to  have  been  resolved  break  out  again  within
five  years.  We  simply  must  do  better  in  identifying
emerging  problems  sooner.  We  also  need  to  put  in
place policies and structures that are effective within a
new, enforceable legal framework.
I  hope,  therefore,  that  the  High-level  Panel  will
address the serious questions involved in international
intervention,  and  put  forward  recommendations  that
will act as a basis for consensus. We trust that they will
also give full and careful consideration to the policies
and  structures  that  we  need  in  order  to  carry  out  our
responsibilities  towards  States  and  societies  at  risk  of
instability.  Any  such  structures  must  facilitate  a
sustained engagement with those States, to ensure that
they receive whatever assistance is needed (cid:151) political,
humanitarian and economic (cid:151) to avert instability or a
return to conflict. In addressing those problems on the
basis  of  the  report  of  the  High-level  Panel,  let  us  not
sacrifice substance on the altar of process.
Ireland  welcomes  the  increasing  role  of  regional
and  subregional  organizations  in  crisis  management,
under the overall authority of the Security Council. The
European  Union  is  engaged  in  developing  its  role  in
conflict prevention and crisis management, while fully
recognizing the central role and authority of the United
Nations.  I  am  pleased  to  state  that  during  Ireland(cid:146)s
recent  presidency  of  the  European  Union,  important
progress  was  achieved  in  implementing  the  Joint
Declaration  on  United  Nations-European  Union
Cooperation  in  Crisis  Management.  It  was  agreed  in
37
A/59/PV.8
June,  during  our  presidency,  that  the  European  Union
will make a rapid response capability available, and at
the service of the United Nations. That will take effect
on an initial basis in 2005, with the full complement of
1,500 troops being ready and available by 2007.
The  efforts  of 
the  African  Union  and 
the
Economic Community of West African States in crisis
management  have  been  particularly  valuable  and
deserve  support.  The  African  Union(cid:146)s  involvement  in
Darfur,  where  it  currently  has  120  monitors  with  a
protection  force  of  300,  is  an  extremely  positive
development.  It  is  fully  supported  by  the  European
Union,  including  through  the  African  Peace  Facility,
established  during  Ireland(cid:146)s  recent  presidency  of  the
Union.  The  African  Union  is  planning  to  augment  its
contingent in Sudan, where it is estimated that a force
of  at  least  5,000  may  be  necessary  to  assure  a  secure
environment  for  the  people  of  Darfur.  The  European
Union  is  ready  to  increase  its  backing  for  the  African
Union(cid:146)s effort accordingly.
Whatever political difficulties may have arisen in
Darfur,  the  people  there  did  not  deserve  to  suffer
massacre, rape and famine, or to see their villages and
crops  destroyed  and  their  livestock  driven  off.  When
the depredations of the ruthless militias were unleashed
upon  them,  they  looked  in  vain  for  the  even-handed
protection of their Government.
I want to recognize the efforts of United Nations
agencies  and  non-governmental  organizations  (cid:151)
including  Irish  organizations  such  as  GOAL,  Concern
and  Tr(cid:243)caire  (cid:151) 
that  responded  so  quickly  and
generously  to  the  humanitarian  crisis  in  Darfur.  The
dedication  of  humanitarian  aid  workers  must  also  be
applauded.
The  humanitarian  needs  in  Darfur  still  remain
immense.  I  appeal  for  continued  support  from  the
international community to meet the funding shortfall.
Ireland  has  contributed  almost  (cid:128)6  million 
in
Government-funded  aid  so  far  this  year  to  assist  the
humanitarian  effort 
through  United  Nations
agencies as well as through Irish and international non-
governmental  organizations.  The  Irish  people  have
been greatly moved by the suffering in Darfur and have
been generous in providing additional, non-government
financial support for the relief effort.
there 
I also wish to pay tribute to the leadership of the
insisting  on  an  appropriate
Secretary-General 
response  from  the  Security  Council.  I  welcome  the
in

recent  adoption  by  the  Security  Council  of  resolution
1564  (2004),  although  it  is  a  matter  of  regret  and
bewilderment  to  many  that  the  resolution  did  not
receive the unanimous backing of Council members. I
hope  that  the  Council  will  now  unite  in  seeking  to
assert its will and bring an end to a situation that is an
affront to humanity.
I urge the authorities in the Sudan to  fulfil, with
the  utmost  urgency,  the  obligations  that  have  been
imposed  on  them  by  the  Security  Council.  They  must
cooperate  closely  with  the  monitors  deployed  by  the
African  Union.  They  must  ensure  that  the  Janjaweed
militia are brought under control and disarmed and that
persons responsible for crimes and serious violations of
human  rights  are  brought  to  justice.  And  they  must
ensure  that  secure  conditions  are  restored  so  that
people  can  return  voluntarily  to  their  homes.  I  also
urge  all  parties  in  the  Abuja  talks,  including  the  rebel
groups,  to  show  flexibility  and  goodwill  so  that  the
underlying  problems  of  Darfur  can  be  resolved  in  a
peaceful manner.
Once  again,  we  meet  in  the  General  Assembly
Hall  under  the  shadow  of  terrorism.  The  recent
appalling 
images  from  Beslan  provide  a  further
emphatic  demonstration  of  the  moral  bankruptcy  of
terrorism. The fact that those attacks targeted innocent
children,  along  with  the  consequent  trauma  caused  to
children  worldwide  who  saw  the  torn  bodies  of  the
children  and  mothers  of  Beslan  on  their  television
screens,  make  them  all  the  more  heinous.  They
reinforce,  if  reinforcement  were  needed,  the  absolute
duty  of  Member  States  of  the  United  Nations  to
cooperate  effectively  in  identifying  and  bringing  to
justice  those  who  plan,  direct,  finance,  facilitate  and
carry out terrorist acts.
Terrorist acts are always reprehensible, and those
who  carry  them  out  bear  full  responsibility  for  them.
That is true irrespective of any underlying factors that
might  exist,  such  as  national  or  civil  conflict  or
oppressive  economic  or  social  conditions.  We  must
show  determination 
to  confront  and  face  down
terrorists  when  they  test  our  resolve  through  their
involvement  in  heinous  acts  of  violence  designed  to
terrorize  the  public  into  conceding  to  their  distorted
view of the world. But we also have to be smart to win.
Terrorism  can  rarely  be  defeated  by  exclusively
military  or  security  means,  although  those  means  are
obviously  a  very  necessary  component  in  the  fight
in 
the  General  Assembly 
against  terrorism.  It  is  necessary,  at  the  same  time,  to
address the root causes of terrorism. I made that point
when  I  addressed 
the
aftermath of the atrocities of 11 September, and I make
no  apologies  for  repeating  it  today.  Let  there  be  no
misunderstanding.  I  offer  no  excuses  for  terrorism.
Terrorism is evil. But it is my strong belief that people
are  not  born  evil.  At  a  certain  point  in  their  lives,
something  (cid:151)  perhaps  a  particular  event  or 
the
experience of indoctrination (cid:151) causes them to embrace
evil. To seek to address that root cause is not to be soft
on  terrorism,  it  is  the  intelligent  way  to  attack
terrorism.
Terrorism  tests  the  effectiveness  of  our  national
and  collective  security  systems,  but  it  also  tests  the
quality  of  our  institutions,  including  our  systems  of
justice,  and  the  strength  of  our  values.  As  we  seek  to
protect  ourselves,  we  must  ensure 
those
institutions  remain  strong,  that  democratic  values  are
not  undermined,  that  our  systems  of  justice  are  not
compromised and that our struggle is conducted in full
respect  for  international  law  and  human  rights  norms.
If  we  fail  to  do  that,  any  success  we  achieve  over
terrorists  will  be  at  the  expense  of  the  way  of  life  we
seek to protect.

The  people  of  Israel  and  Palestine  continue  to
suffer  from  violence  that  is  as  futile  as  it  is  tragic.  The
root cause of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a struggle
over  land.  The  land  must  be  shared  by  agreement
arrived  at  through  negotiation  between  the  parties  to
the  conflict.  The  continuing  unilateral  expansion  of
settlements  and  the  construction  and  maintenance  of
the  separation  barrier  on  the  West  Bank  will  make  the
conflict more difficult to resolve. The entire international
community  (cid:151)  particularly  Israel(cid:146)s  friends  (cid:151)  need  to
send that clear and unambiguous message to the Israeli
Government and the people of Israel.

Ireland  acknowledges 
the
responsibility,  of  the  Israeli  Government  to  protect  its
people,  including,  if  it  so  wishes,  by  a  security  fence
along its recognized borders. However, the building of
the fence in the West Bank serves to divide Palestinian
communities  and  creates  severe  hardship  for  them.  It
will also serve to perpetuate the so-called facts on the
ground,  and  make  it  more  difficult  to  reach  a  final
settlement.  The  advisory  opinion  of  the  International
Court of Justice has given clear guidance on the fence
that  should  be  given  careful  consideration  by  those
whose policies and actions it addresses.

Ireland, 
in  common  with 
its  EU  partners,
continues  to  believe  that  the  only  way  to  reach  a
comprehensive settlement of the conflict is through the
Quartet road map. In the Tullamore Declaration, issued
during  Ireland(cid:146)s  recent  presidency  of  the  European
Union, EU ministers welcomed the expressed intention
of  Prime  Minister  Sharon  to  withdraw  from  Gaza  and
acknowledged  the  impetus  that  such  a  withdrawal
could  give  to  the  peace  process,  as  long  as  it  met
certain  conditions,  including  that  it  take  place  in  the
context of the implementation of the road map.
I 
therefore  urge  Israel  and 
the  Palestinian
Authority  to  cooperate  closely  with  the  Quartet  to
ensure  that  the  withdrawal  from  Gaza  is  accompanied
by the full and effective assumption by the Palestinian
Authority of its responsibilities in the territory, and that
a  momentum  towards  the  full  implementation  of  the
road map is developed.

The passage of Security Council resolution 1546
(2004) and the subsequent establishment of the Interim
Government  of  Iraq,  represented  a  crucial  coming
together  by 
the
importance of reconstruction in Iraq. It is vital that that
Government  should  be  able  to  move  ahead  and
establish  a  full  democratic  mandate.  However,  the
security  situation  in  Iraq  remains  a  matter  of  grave
concern  to  us  all,  and  the  challenges  facing  the  new
Government  are  great.  An  end  to  the  lethal  violence
that  is  disrupting  the  normal  development  of  that
country is essential.
Ireland  has  always  seen  the  role  of  the  United
Nations  as  central  to  the  issue  of  reconstructing  Iraq.
We  therefore  welcome  the  forthcoming  return  of  the
United  Nations  mission.  Ireland  and  its  EU  partners
will  seek  to  ensure  that  that  mission  is  provided  with
the  necessary  security  to  allow  it  to  carry  out  its
functions.

The  elections  to  the  Northern  Ireland  Assembly
last  November  gave  leadership  mandates  to  the  Sinn
Fein  party  and  the  Democratic  Unionist  Party  in  their
respective nationalist and unionist  communities. Since
then,  both  Governments  have  engaged  in  intensive
discussions  with  all  the  parties  to  finally  resolve  the
key  issues  of  confidence  that  have  thus  far  frustrated
the full achievement of peace and political stability in
Northern  Ireland.  Those  key  issues  include  ending
paramilitary  activity  in  all  its  forms;  completing  the

and must, be overcome at the earliest possible date. It
was  noteworthy  in  that  regard  that  the  leader  of  the
Democratic  Unionist  Party,  Mr.  Ian  Paisley,  made  the
point 
that  a  golden

the
fundamental balance of the Good Friday Agreement, in
particular its key power-sharing provisions.

If,  on  the  other  hand,  those  institutional  issues

I  will  conclude  where  I  began,  on  the  need  to
rededicate ourselves to the reinvigoration of this great
Organization.
Next  year  will  be  a  year  in  which  important
decisions on the future of the  United Nations  must  be
taken. We need to rededicate ourselves to the principles
and purposes for which this Organization was founded.
We need to restore the sense of ambition and idealism
that illuminated the United Nations at its inception. We
need, above all, to build an Organization that is results-
oriented  and  that  can  demonstrate  that  politics  is  the
most effective means of resolving conflict. Let us make
2005  the  year  in  which  the  United  Nations  is  reborn

negotiations  between  the  Government  and  the  Sudan
People(cid:146)s  Liberation  Movement/Army,  under 
the
auspices  of 
Intergovernmental  Authority  on
Development  (IGAD)  and  Kenya(cid:146)s  chairmanship,  and
with the support of the IGAD partners, had made great
progress and peace had become imminent. I am glad to
say  that  the  last  round  of  negotiations  resulted  in  the
signing, in the first week of June 2004, of six protocols
dealing  with  security  arrangements,  cessation  of
hostilities,  distribution  of  wealth,  power-sharing  and
the  conflict  in  the  Nubian  mountains  region,  the  Blue
Nile  and  Abiai.  We  decided  to  hold  the  last  round  of
negotiations on 7 October 2004 to complete the details
of  a  comprehensive  peace,  which  will,  it  is  hoped,  be
signed at the end of this year.
We  stand  on  the  threshold  of  peace.  The  new
challenge before us now is to overcome the differences
of  the  past,  start  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation,
concentrate  on  development  and  strengthen  the  pillars
of  peace  and  national  unity  on 
the  basis  of
compatriotism  and  equality  of  rights  and  duties.  For
that reason, my Government declares its firm intention
of  conducting  a  national  dialogue  with  all  political
forces, inside and outside the Sudan, in order to make
peace a national objective that can be achieved through
a national charter.
It also gives me pleasure to say that in addition to
the  talks  in  Naivasha  and  Abuja  my  Government
started a third forum in Cairo, under the auspices of the
Egyptian  Government,  to  engage  in  dialogue  with
factions  of  the  national  opposition,  headquartered  in
Asmara.
Because  war  has  devastated  all  sectors  of  the
country,  reconstruction  efforts  are  especially  difficult.
We  would  like  to  express  our  appreciation  to  the
A/59/PV.8
international  community  for  the  humanitarian  assistance
they  provided  during  the  war.  We  now  appeal  to  the
international  community  to  help  in  the  reconstruction
process: to ameliorate the living conditions in the areas
devastated  by  war  all  over  the  Sudan;  to  aid  in  the
resettlement  of 
internally  displaced  persons  and
refugees; and to participate in development projects in
order to achieve peace and stability.
We  were  at  the  threshold  of  peace  in  the  south
when another war broke out in Darfur as the result of a
rebel  movement  begun  by  some  tribes  and  supported
by  foreign  forces.  The  rebel  movement(cid:146)s  terrorist
action  was  not  directed  against  the  Government  only,
but against those tribes that refused to join them. That,
in turn, pushed those tribes to train and arm militias to
defend 
the  rebels.  The  rebel
movement  targeted  the  security  apparatus,  sowing
death and destruction, which led to the release of criminal
Janjaweed groups from prisons. The aggression continued
against civilians and Government institutions.
themselves  against 
The  root  causes  of  Darfur  go  back  to  conflicts
among the tribal communities in the region. Previously,
those  conflicts  were  settled  according  to  traditional
customs and  norms.  But  the  growth  in  population  and
the number of livestock, coupled with a decrease in the
water  supply  owing  to  desertification,  led  to  tense
struggles  between  grazing  land  tribes  and  farmers.
There were other causes for regional conflict: an influx
of arms and the interference of neighbouring countries
that  tried  to  exploit  the  tense  situation,  encouraging
rebellions  against  the  Government  by  training  and
arming certain groups.

The  present  conflict  in  Darfur  started  in  March
2003, when rebels started inciting dissension and strife,
attacking  highways,  plundering  livestock  and  taking
international 
as  hostages.  The
Government tried to convince them to abandon military
action,  but  they  insisted  on  occupying  cities  and
villages and terrorizing tribes, forcing them into armed
service.  Everyone  had  to  carry  weapons  for  self-
defence.  Then,  the  Government  intervened  to  try  to
halt  the  hostilities,  impose  law  and  order  and  prevent
civil war.
This  conflict,  which  was 
the
Government,  has  created  extremely  complicated  and
dire humanitarian conditions. The Government took the
necessary measures. It sent food relief to Darfur. Next,
it eliminated all the administrative, legal and technical
imposed  on

arrangements  that  impeded  relief  work,  it  allowed
relief  organizations  to  enter  Darfur  unimpeded,  and  it
curtailed certain regulations, such as visa requirements,

Furthermore,  out  of  its  belief  in  a  peaceful
settlement  as  a  strategic  choice,  the  Government
entered  into  negotiations  with  the  rebels  under  the
auspices of the President of Chad, which culminated in
the Abashi agreement in 2003, but that agreement was
later  violated  by  the  rebels.  However,  this  did  not
weaken  the  Government(cid:146)s  resolve  to  continue  its
efforts,  until  we  attained  the  ceasefire  agreement  in
N(cid:146)Djamena.  In  order  to  cooperate  with  the  African
Union,  we  sent  a  high-level  delegation  to  the  first
round  of  negotiations  at  Addis  Ababa;  our  delegation
was given full authority to reach a peaceful settlement
with the rebels. But the rebels boycotted the talks.
The  Government  redoubled  its  efforts  at  all
levels (cid:151) political, security and humanitarian (cid:151) out of
its responsibility for the people, and it cooperated fully
with  the  United  Nations  so  as  to  implement  the
agreement  that  had  been  reached  with  the  Secretary-
General.  Then,  on  30  July  2004,  the  Security  Council
adopted  resolution  1556  (2004),  which  gave 
the
Government only one month to deal with the problem
and  threatened  the  imposition  of  sanctions.  It  is
regrettable  that  this  resolution  sent  an  erroneous
message,  thus  encouraging  the  rebels  to  give  up
negotiations  with  good  intention.  They  insisted  on
conditions that were impossible to implement. And this
led  to  the  collapse  of  negotiations  in  Addis  Ababa,  in
spite of the African Union(cid:146)s great efforts.
Notwithstanding  the  faults  and  impracticality  of
this  Security  Council  resolution,  my  Government,
abiding 
and
responsibility  for  its  people,  will  continue  to  do  its
utmost to find the shortest way for the return of peace,
stability and security to Darfur. My Government signed

a working plan for Darfur with the United Nations; this
plan  included  detailed  arrangements  for  humanitarian
aid,  security  and  protection  of  displaced  persons  and
their voluntary return. We assigned extra police forces,
numbering  10,000.  We  also  signed  an  agreement  with
the  International  Organization  for  Migration  on  the
return of refugees.
Within  the  framework  of  a  political  settlement,
and despite the intransigence and lack of seriousness of
the  rebels,  my  Government  accepted  the  invitation
extended by President Obasanjo of Nigeria, the current
Chairman  of  the  African  Union.  We  then  sent  another
high-ranking delegation to Abuja on 23 August out of

The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now
give  the  floor  to  Mr.  Per  Stig  Moeller,  Minister  for
Foreign Affairs of Denmark.
Mr.  Moeller  (Denmark):  When  we  met  a  year
ago, there was widespread concern that we had reached
an  impasse  that  threatened  to  paralyse  the  United
Nations.  I  am  happy  to  note  today  that  this  looming
threat of division is receding and is being replaced by a
renewed commitment to multilateralism.
In  that  spirit,  Denmark  welcomes  the  Security
Council(cid:146)s  unanimous  adoption  of  its  resolution  1546
(2004), on Iraq. The resolution is, first and foremost, of
great  significance  for  the  prospects  of  peace  and
stability in Iraq and throughout the region. It is also of
great  importance  for  the  Security  Council(cid:146)s  ability  to
perform its role as the custodian of international peace
and security.
The  United  Nations  must  play  a  leading  role  in
the  political  process  and  in  the  reconstruction  of  Iraq.
The wisdom and skill of the Secretary-General and his
Special  Adviser  have  advanced  this  process,  and  we
hope that the advisory  role of  the  United Nations will
be  further  enhanced.  We  urge  all  Member  States  to

Denmark strongly supports the Secretary-General(cid:146)s

looks forward to its report later this year. Efforts to reform
the Organization, including enlarging the membership of
the  Security  Council,  must  continue  if  the  United
Nations  is  to  meet  the  new  challenges.  Democracy  is
also  a  question  of  representation,  and  if  large  parts  of
the  world  do  not  feel  represented  in  the  Security
Council there is a risk that they will not feel bound by
its  decisions.  The  Security  Council  must  reflect  the
realities of the world of today, not those of the past.

Denmark will endeavour to assist in this process across
the full range of United Nations activities.
threats 
Denmark  is  a  candidate  for  election  to  the
Security  Council  during  this  session  of  the  General
Assembly. If elected, the focus of Denmark(cid:146)s tenure in
the  Council  will  be  to  seek  new  and  more  effective
ways  of  integrating  security  and  development  and
strengthening  international  law.  In  that  connection,  I
welcome  the  Secretary-General(cid:146)s  important  opening
statement  in  this  debate  (see  A/59/PV.3),  in  which  he
outlined  the  fundamental  principles  for  a  world  order
based on international law.
Greater  coherence  is  needed  in  international
peace  operations.  We  firmly  believe  that  the  United
Nations  needs  to  give  civilian  crisis  management  the
same  priority  that  is  accorded  to  military  crisis
management.  More  than  40  per  cent  of  countries
emerging  from  conflict  slide  back  into  conflict.  In
order  to  build  sustainable  peace,  much  more  attention
needs  to  be  given  to  the  civilian  aspects  of  crisis
management.  This  includes  the  demobilization  and
reintegration  of  combatants  as  well  as  the  social,
economic and legal reconstruction of war-torn societies.
We  must  make  State-building  a  central  goal  of
conflict management and peace-building, alongside the
provision  of  basic  security.  Whatever  mechanism  we
set up, the challenge is to ensure the involvement of all
stakeholders.  That  includes  national  Governments,  the
Secretariat,  United  Nations  development  funds  and
programmes,  the  Bretton  Woods  institutions,  regional
organizations and bilateral donors.

In  order  to  improve  compliance  with  Security

Terrorism  and  the  proliferation  of  weapons  of
mass  destruction  are  serious  threats  to  peace  and
security  and  impede  progress  towards  stability  and
prosperity.  Terrorists  threaten  the  everyday  life  and
values  of  millions  of  innocent  individuals.  Terrorists
must  be  stopped  by  hard  power  and  by  soft  power  to
prevent decades of unrest and terror.
Countering  new  threats  requires  a  multifaceted,
integrated  response  by  the  United  Nations  and  its
partners. Success demands synergy, a finely tuned mix
of  diplomacy,  aid,  police  efforts,  intelligence,  legal
assistance  and  (cid:151)  if  need  be  (cid:151)  military  power.  The
United  Nations  must  take  a  leading  role  in  the  fight
against  terrorism,  providing  both  the  framework  for
global efforts and the legitimacy for collective action.
Terror must not lead to isolation; it must not stop
globalization.  In  the  world  of  today,  huge  global
disparities  in  resources  have  become  apparent  to
everybody.  Social  and  economic  exclusion,  as  well  as
deficient  democracies,  the  absence  of  the  rule  of  law
and  lack  of  respect  for  human  rights,  contribute  to
political 
religious  extremism.
Ensuring  that  new  generations  have  access  to  the
benefits  of  globalization  (cid:151)  such  as  democracy  and
hope for a better future (cid:151) is a global challenge.

The main responsibility for fighting terrorism lies
with  individual  States.  This  includes  compliance  with
relevant  Security  Council  resolutions,  as  well  as
ratification  and  implementation  of  the  12  United
Nations  conventions  against 
terrorism.  Denmark
supports  efforts  to  reinvigorate  the  Counter-Terrorism
Committee  (CTC).  We  support  efforts  to  renew  and
upgrade  the  offer  of  technical  assistance  to  countries
that  need  it.  The  work  of  the  CTC  must  be  better
focused  and  linked  with  the  assistance  extended  to
countries that have the will (cid:151) but lack the means (cid:151) to
meet  the  requirements  of  Security  Council  resolution
1373 (2001).

Denmark  attaches  the  highest  priority  to  Africa(cid:146)s
development and would like the situation there and its
prospects to be high on the agenda at the 2005 summit.
In  order  to  reach  the  Millennium  Development
Goals,  an  effective  partnership  will  be  required
between developed and developing  countries. The  gap
between  goals  and  resources  must  be  closed.  We  are
deeply  concerned  about  the  inadequacy  of  the  current
46
level  of  development  financing.  Further  resources  are
needed, as is better coordination in their allocation.
Last  year,  Denmark  took  the  lead  in  making  our
commitments  transparent  in  a  Millennium  Development
Goals  report.  A  new  report  will  be  published  next
month. We call on all other States to do likewise.
Development  efforts  and  conflict  resolution  in
Africa  must  go  hand  in  hand.  Progress  achieved  in
economic  and  social  development  will  be  sustainable
only  if  we  manage  to  put  an  end  to  conflict  on  the
African  continent.  We  stand  ready  to  support  the
significant  and  sustained  efforts  undertaken  by  the

Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria.
Mr.  Passy  (spoke  in  French):  I  would  like,  on
behalf of Bulgaria, to offer my sincere congratulations
to  Mr.  Jean  Ping  on  his  assumption  of  the  presidency
(cid:151)  a  position  of  great  responsibility.  Given  his  great
experience in multilateral diplomacy, I sure that he will
lead  the  deliberations  of  the  fifty-ninth  session  of  the
General  Assembly  to  a  successful  outcome.  I  would
also  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  pay  tribute  to  the
work  done  by  his  predecessor,  Mr.  Julian  Hunte,  to
reform and revitalize the Assembly.
(spoke in English)
This is the first year that the Republic of Bulgaria
has  taken  part  in  the  deliberations  of  the  General
Assembly as a full-fledged member of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and as a State which has successfully
concluded  its  negotiations  on  joining  the  European
Union.  We  are  fully  aware  of  the  great  responsibility
which we bear this year in discharging our mandate as
the  Chairman-in-Office  of 
for
Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe.  All  those  factors
encourage Bulgaria to redouble its efforts in support of
the  United  Nations.  We  shall  continue  our  efforts
aimed  at  strengthening  the  authority  and  role  of  the
United  Nations.  We  shall  support  the  constructive
proposals for reforms within the United Nations, which
should enhance its capacity and effectiveness.

Today  the  United  Nations  faces  new  challenges,
which  require  resolute  joint  action  and  coordination.
The  United  Nations  and  its  bodies,  as  well  as  the

to  make  an  important  contribution  aimed  at  dealing

International  terrorism  poses  the  most  serious
threat to international peace and security. This requires
coordinated  and  resolute  action  by  all  States  and  the
entire  international  community.  Nothing  can  justify
terrorist  acts.  It  is  essential  that  terrorists  do  not  get
hold  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction  nor  distract  us
from  our  agenda,  as  outlined  by  the  Millennium
Declaration.
This  month  the  world  remembers  the  victims  of
the 
terrorist  acts  of  11  September,  marking 
the
anniversary  of  those  tragic  events.  We  all  watched  in

innocent  children  and  their  parents  in  the  school  in

that
international  terrorism  threatens  all  States  and  that  it

active  participation  in  the  global  coalition  against
terrorism.  We  are  committed  to  pursuing  that  policy
steadfastly,  even  though  we  have  suffered  human
losses and sustained damage.
Within  the  United  Nations  system,  the  Security
Council  and  its  Counter-Terrorism  Committee  (CTC)
are vested with the task of ensuring success in the fight
against international terrorism. We share the view that
Security  Council  resolution  1535  (2004)  and  the
creation  of  the  new  Counter-Terrorism  Committee
Executive  Directorate  have  improved  coordination  in
this  field.  The  Al  Qaeda  and  Taliban  Committee,
beefed  up  in  2004  with  the  Monitoring  Group  and
Sanctions  Enforcement  Support  Team,  should  also
continue to wield its positive influence.
Within  the  framework  of  the  Organization  for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Bulgaria
has  been  assisting  in  the  joint  initiatives  of  the  CTC
and  OSCE  and  of  the  United  Nations  Office  for  Drug

The  development  of

Bulgaria  is  firmly  convinced  that  the  United
Nations  must  play  a  key  role  in  the  stabilization  and
restoration  of  Iraq,  in  the  ongoing  political  and
constitutional  process,  based  on  Security  Council
resolution  1546  (2004),  and  in  the  preparations  for
democratic  and  free  elections.  We  welcome  the  first
steps  taken  in  Baghdad  by  Mr.  Ashraf  Qazi,  the
Secretary-General(cid:146)s  Special  Representative,  as  well  as
the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission
for Iraq (UNAMI).
There  have  been  encouraging  developments  in
the  resolution  of  conflicts  in  certain  hot  spots  in  the
world,  such  as  Sierra  Leone  and  Timor-Leste.  At  the
same  time,  there  are  complicated  situations  in  other
regions, particularly in Africa. The situation in Darfur
is of serious concern. Security Council resolution 1556
(2004) and the recently adopted resolution 1564 (2004)

must be complied with in order to avoid a repetition of
the tragedy in other parts of the African continent, similar
to the events that occurred during the last decade.
During Bulgaria(cid:146)s chairmanship of the OSCE, we
have been making concerted efforts to spur and further
develop  cooperation  between  the  United  Nations  and
the OSCE. We have been encouraged by the Secretary-
General(cid:146)s  specific  initiatives,  aimed  at  improving  the
synchronization  of 
and
exchange  of  information  with  regional  organizations.
We  give  very  high  marks  to  United  Nations-OSCE
cooperation  in  the  western  Balkans,  the  region  of  the
Caucasus and in Central Asia.

In  my  view,  closer  interaction  between  them  is  of

In  adapting  ourselves  to  current  geopolitical

over the Black Sea (cid:151) an endeavour which can lay the
groundwork  for  future  security,  cooperation  and

We are deeply convinced that the Black Sea dialogue is
of special importance not only for participating nations
but also because it can set a positive example for other

Respect  for  and  observance  of  internationally
recognized  standards  of  human  rights  by  Member
States is  a prerequisite  both  for  their  national  security
and 
is  also  a
prerequisite  for  international  peace  and  security.  The
protection  of  basic  human  rights  and  fundamental
freedoms  worldwide  is  a  priority  in  the  policy  of  the
Bulgarian  Government.  Our  historical  experience
teaches  us  that,  in  the  quest  to  achieve  prosperity  and
security in any society, it is necessary to have not only
an  adequate  legal  system  and  mechanisms  for  its
effective implementation, but also a spirit of tolerance.
We must not tolerate only one minority and ignore the
others.  Anti-Semitism,  anti-Islamism,  anti-Arabism,
anti-Europeanism,  anti-Americanism  and  even  anti-
globalism ought to be equally and totally rejected.
Bulgaria  welcomes  the  progressive  reintegration
of Libya into the international community. However, my
country  believes  that  a  compelling  message  from  the
Libyan authorities about their respect for human rights
and human values could only be communicated through a
just  solution  to  the  well-known  case  of  the  medical
workers (cid:151) six Bulgarians and one Palestinian (cid:151) who
have been held behind bars in Tripoli and Benghazi for
almost  six  years.  In  this  regard,  we  call  upon  the
United  Nations  to  redouble  its  efforts  in  the  fight
against  the  HIV/AIDS  pandemic  in  Africa,  which  we
believe  is  the  cause  of  these  tragic  developments
concerning these seven innocent people.

issues  concerning  women,
children and persons belonging to vulnerable groups of
the population, including elderly and disabled persons,
as  inseparable  parts  of  the  entire  complex  of  human

the 
The  measures  aimed  at  revitalizing  all 
the
activities  of  the  United  Nations  are  of  extraordinary
importance  for  the  current  session  of  the  General
Assembly.  The  effectiveness  of  the  work  of  United
Nations bodies, particularly the General Assembly, the
Security  Council  and 
the  Economic  and  Social
Council,  is  fundamental  for  solidifying  the  all-around

role  of  this  world  Organization.  The  sooner  we  do  it,
the better, and all the more so since next year we will
be  celebrating  the  sixtieth  anniversary  of  the  United
Nations. Let us hope that we will at that time be able to
congratulate  ourselves  on  the  adoption  of  these  badly
needed reforms. Taking all  this  into  consideration  and
acting on the basis of the political will of all Member
States, as declared at the Millennium Summit, we give
our  support  to  the  common  efforts  for  speeding  up
United Nations reform and for strengthening the ties and
coordination  among  the  United  Nations,  the  Bretton
Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization.
The United Nations plays a principal and pivotal
role  in  the  Republic  of  Bulgaria(cid:146)s  foreign  policy,  as
stated  at  the  fifty-eighth  session  of  the  General
Assembly  by  our  Prime  Minister,  Mr.  Simeon  Saxe-
Coburg-Gotha.  To  this  end,  we  shall  continue  our
efforts  to  promote  the  role  of  the  United  Nations  and
enhance  its  efficiency  and  organizational  structure  in
order  to  promote  peace,  development,  democracy  and
the rule of law.
The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now
give  the  floor  to  Sheikh  Mohammad  Al-Sabah  Al-
Salem  Al-Sabah,  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs  of  the
State of Kuwait.
Mr.  Al-Sabah  (Kuwait)  (spoke  in  Arabic):  I  am
pleased to  convey my  congratulations to the President
elected  to  the  fifty-ninth  session  of  the  General
Assembly.  I  likewise  take  this  opportunity  to  express
our  appreciation  to  the  Secretary-General,  Mr.  Kofi
Annan,  for  the  great  efforts  he  has  been  exerting  to
restructure and reform the United  Nations, to improve
its methods of work and revitalize its role in all fields
in  order  to  face  the  demands  and  challenges  of  the
twenty-first century.
Reform  and  restructuring  of  the  United  Nations
system  have  become  imperatives,  since  this  world
Organization  remains  the  ideal  mechanism  to  address
the urgent problems of the world, by way of combating
poverty  and  hunger,  ensuring  the  non-proliferation  of
weapons  of  mass  destruction,  achieving  disarmament
and resolving armed conflicts, combating diseases that
take  the  lives  of  millions,  such  as  AIDS  and  malaria.
The  United  Nations  has  organized  numerous
international  conferences  and  summits  in  the  last  10
years,  such  as  the  Millennium  Summit,  the  World
Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  in  Johannesburg
and  the  International  Conference  on  Financing  for

those
multilateral  problems.  The  international  community
may not have been able to achieve enough progress in
addressing  some  of  these  issues,  but  this  should  not
prevent  us  from  redoubling  our  efforts  to  implement
the  international  treaties,  resolutions  and  programmes
of  action  of  such  United  Nations  conferences.  This
must  be  done  in  order  to  ensure  respect  for  the
purposes  and  principles  of  the  Charter,  international
law,  the  central  role  of  the  United  Nations  and  its
primacy in preserving international peace and security
and in the strengthening of international cooperation in
the economic, social and cultural spheres.
Terrorism  is  one  of  the  major  challenges  the
United  Nations  faces  in  this  millennium.  Its  negative
effects are extremely serious and touch upon all States
without  exception,  although 
to  varying  degrees.
Terrorist  attacks  such  as  those  of  11  September  2001,
the  attacks  against  the  brotherly  kingdom  of  Saudi
Arabia and the events in Jakarta and Beslan emphasize
the fact that this phenomenon affects us all. Its targets are
all peoples of the world, not any one State in particular.

all  of  the  United  Nations  resolutions  to  combat
terrorism. Terrorism, however, is not related to any one
ethnic  group,  culture  or  religion.  It  is  an  international
phenomenon  that  must  be  addressed  by  the  United
Nations,  as  the  ideal  framework  for  diagnosing  its
causes  and  arriving  at  the  necessary  solutions  needed
to contain it.

A  year  and  a  half  after  the  fall  of  Saddam
Hussein(cid:146)s  dictatorship,  the  situation  in  Iraq  continues
to be  a delicate one of uncertainty and  insecurity,  due
to  terrorist  acts  carried  out  by  armed  groups  and  the
remnants  of  the  old  regime.  This  is  hampering  the
efforts  of  the  interim  Iraqi  Government,  which  is
endeavouring to rebuild what the old regime destroyed
through its policy of aggression.
Convinced as we are that security and stability in
Iraq  mean  security  for  the  region  as  a  whole,  Kuwait
supports  the  efforts  of  the  Iraqis  to  rebuild  their
country  in  these  difficult  times,  so  that  Iraq  may
resume its positive international and regional roles. We
are sure that the Iraqi people will be able to do this. In
that  regard,  we  support  Security  Council  resolution
1546  (2004),  which  supports  the  effort  that  everyone
We  are  following  with  great  concern  the  tragic
situation faced by the Palestinian people in the occupied
Arab territories as a result of Israeli policies and practices
that contravene international and humanitarian law.
We  reaffirm  our  support  to  the  struggle  of  the
Palestinian people and their legitimate claim to recover
their  political  rights.  We  therefore  call  upon  Israel  to
respect  Security  Council  resolutions  242  (1967),  338
(1973),  and  1515  (2003),  the  principle  of  land  for
peace,  the  road  map  and  the  dismantling  of  the  racial
separation  wall.  That  is  part  of  our  integral  vision  for
resolving the situation in the Middle East, which must
be  based  on  mutual  respect  and  cooperation  between
all parties.
To  ensure  stability  in  the  Middle  East,  we  must
also  work  to  eradicate  weapons  of  mass  destruction,

and all parties need to pursue the path of understanding
and  dialogue  to  implement  the  noble  principles  of  the
Charter  of  the  United  Nations  governing  inter-State
relations and relations among the peoples of the world.
We  reiterate,  in  that  regard,  that  the  dispute  between
the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of
Iran  concerning  the  three  islands  that  belong  to  the
Emirates  should  be  resolved  by  peaceful  means.  We
urge the two parties to resolve that dispute as rapidly as
possible.
Regarding Darfur, we are all concerned about the
humanitarian tragedy there. We believe that the Sudan
is  striving  to  find  a  reasonable  solution  to  that
humanitarian dilemma.

Serbia and Montenegro is a small country that has

problems  and  misfortunes.  The  recent  wars  that  saw  the
break-up of Yugoslavia (cid:151) one of the founding members
of the United Nations (cid:151) have had immense and painful
consequences:  unemployment;  poverty; 
tragic

young people, which breeds drug dependence; a rising
suicide  rate;  and  the  desperate  position  of  Serbs  in

The reality of Kosovo and Metohija today is both
dramatic  and  grim.  Over  the  past  five  years,  the
international  administration  and  dominance  of  the
Albanian majority of this Serbian province have led to
the  killing  or  abduction  of  more  than  2,500  Serbs,
including  many  children,  and  to  the  destruction  of
1,500-year-old 
and
approximately  40,000  homes.  As  a  result  of  terrorism
and  massive  violations  of  basic  human  rights,  nearly

expelled from Kosovo and Metohija.

decision  to  convene,  in  November,  an  international
donor  conference  aimed  at  funding  the  reconstruction
of destroyed churches and monasteries in Kosovo. We
are  also  grateful  for  the  principled  position  that  all
homes must be rebuilt, that conditions must be created

The spirit of a united Europe and a united world

we respect the existing State borders that we share with
our neighbours, we wish to erase them in everyday life
and  to  build  a  common  European  future  based  on
dialogue, reconciliation and equality among all nations.
We are fully confident that, with the strong support of
the United Nations, we will attain that goal.
But  the  insistence  by  some  on  the  creation  of  a
sovereign  State  of  Kosovo  amounts  to  a  call  for  the
