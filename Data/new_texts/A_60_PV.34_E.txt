Agenda item 111 (continued)
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs
(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic
and Social Council
The  President:  The  General  Assembly  will  now
turn  to  the  election  of  18  members  of  the  Economic
and  Social  Council  to  replace  those  members  whose
term  of  office  expires  on  31  December  2005.  The  18
outgoing  members  are:  Azerbaijan,  Benin,  the  Congo,
Cuba,  Ecuador,  France,  Germany,  Ireland,  Jamaica,
Japan,  Kenya,  Malaysia,  Mozambique,  Nicaragua,
Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Spain and Turkey.
As of 1 January 2006, the following States will be
represented  on  the  Economic  and  Social  Council:
Albania,  Armenia,  Australia,  Bangladesh,  Belgium,
Belize, Brazil, Canada, Chad, China, Colombia, Costa
Rica, Denmark, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Guinea,  Iceland,  India,  Indonesia,  Italy,  Lithuania,
Mauritius,  Mexico,  Namibia,  Nigeria,  Pakistan,
Panama,  Poland,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  the  Russian
Federation, South Africa, Thailand, Tunisia, the United
Arab  Emirates,  the  United  Kingdom  of  Great  Britain
and Northern Ireland, the United Republic of Tanzania
and the United States of America. The names of those
36 States should therefore not appear on the ballots.
In  accordance  with  paragraph  4  of  General
Assembly  resolution  2847  (XXVI)  of  20  December
1971, and taking into account the number of States that
will  remain  members  of  the  Council  after  1  January
2006,  the  18  members  should  be  elected  as  follows:
five  from  the  Group  of  African  States,  three  from  the
Group of Asian States, one from the Group of Eastern
European  States,  four  from 
the  Group  of  Latin
American  and  Caribbean  States  and  five  from  the
Group  of  Western  European  and  other  States.  The
ballot papers reflect that pattern.
I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  those
candidates,  their  number  not  exceeding  the  number  of
seats  to  be  filled,  who  receive  the  greatest  number  of
votes  and  a  two-thirds  majority  of  members  present
and voting, will be declared elected. In the case of a tie
vote  for  a  remaining  seat,  there  will  be  a  special
restricted  ballot  limited  to  those  candidates  that  have
obtained an equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to
that procedure?
It was so decided.
The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the
rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret
ballot and there shall be no nominations.
Regarding candidatures of the respective regional
Groups,  the  Secretariat  has  been  informed  of  the
following.  For  the  five  vacant  seats  from  among  the
African States, the Group has endorsed five candidates:
Angola,  Benin,  Guinea-Bissau,  Madagascar  and
Mauritania.
This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of
speeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original
languages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature
of a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room
C-154A. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.

In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of
procedure,  we  shall  now  proceed  to  the  election  by
secret ballot.
Before we begin the voting process, I should like
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a
point  of  order  on  the  actual  conduct  of  the  voting.  I
should

representatives  during  the  time  of  the  conduct  of  the
election.
to  seek 
like 
I should also like to remind members that during
the  voting,  all  campaigning  should  cease  in  the
conference  room.  That  means,  in  particular,  that  once
the election has begun, no campaign materials may be
distributed  in  the  room.  All  representatives  are  also
asked  to  remain  in  their  seats  in  order  that  the  voting
process  may  proceed  in  an  orderly  manner.  I  thank
members in advance for their cooperation.
We shall now begin the voting process.
Ballot papers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E”
will now be distributed. I request representatives to use
only  those  ballot  papers  and  to  write  on  them  the
names of the States for which they wish to vote.
A  ballot  paper  containing  more  names  from  the
relevant region than the number of seats assigned to it
will be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a
ballot  paper  that  do  not  belong  to  that  region  will  not
be counted at all.
At  the  invitation  of  the  President,  Mr.  Londoño
(Colombia),  Ms.  Heikkilä  (Finland),  Ms.  Kollár
2
(Hungary),  Mr.  Kyaw  Moe  Tun  (Myanmar),
Mr. Lee  Jang-keun  (Republic  of  Korea)  and
Mr. Kitchen (Zimbabwe) acted as tellers.
A vote was taken by secret ballot.
