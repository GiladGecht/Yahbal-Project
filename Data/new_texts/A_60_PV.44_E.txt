The  President:  The  General  Assembly  will
proceed  to  the  election  of  five  members  of  the
International  Court  of  Justice  for  a  nine-year  term  of
office  commencing  on  6  February  2006.  The  terms  of
office  of  the  following  judges  expire  on  5  February
2006:  Mr.  Vladlen  Vereshchetin  (Russian  Federation),
Mr.  Pieter  Kooijmans  (Netherlands),  Mr. Francisco
Rezek (Brazil), Mr. Thomas Buergenthal (United States
of America) and Mr. Nabil Elaraby (Egypt).
In  connection  with  the  election,  I  should  like  to
bring  the  following  matters  to  the  attention  of  the
members of the General Assembly.
I  should  like  to  confirm  that,  at  this  time,  the
Security  Council, 
the  General
Assembly, is also proceeding to elect five members of
independently  of 
the Court. This procedure is in accordance with Article
8 of the Statute of the Court, which provides that
“The General Assembly and the Security Council
shall  proceed  independently  of  one  another  to
elect the members of the Court.”
Accordingly,  the  results  of  the  voting  in  the  General
Assembly  will  be  communicated 
the  Security
Council  only  when  five  candidates  have  obtained  the
required majority in the Assembly.
to 
I  should  like  to  draw  the  attention  of  the
Assembly  to  the  documents  relating  to  the  election.
Document  A/60/186  contains  a  memorandum  by  the
Secretary-General  on  the  present  composition  of  the
Court and the procedure to be followed in the General
Assembly  and  in  the  Security  Council  with  regard  to
the  election.  Document  A/60/187  and  corrigendum  1
contain  the  list  of  candidates  nominated  by  national
groups.
In  this  connection,  I  have  received  information
from  the  Legal  Counsel  that,  after  the  established
deadline  for  nominating  candidates,  the  following
additional  submissions  were  received  from  several
national  groups,  all  of  which  relate  to  the  candidates
already  nominated  by  other  national  groups  appearing
in documents A/60/187 and corrigendum 1:  Mohamed
Bennouna  (Morocco)  has  been  nominated  also  by  the
national  group  of  Argentina  and  Jordan;  Thomas
Buergenthal  (United  States  of  America)  has  been
nominated also by the national group of Germany, Peru
and  Romania;  Julio  D.  González  Campos  (Spain)  has

been  nominated  also  by 
the  national  group  of
Argentina;  Kenneth  Keith  (New  Zealand)  has  been
nominated  also  by  the  national  group  of  Germany,
Luxembourg  and  Papua  New  Guinea;  Bernardo
Sepúlveda Amor (Mexico) has been nominated also by
the  national  group  of  Argentina,  the  Netherlands,
Poland  and  Romania;  and  Leonid  Skotnikov  (Russian
Federation)  has  been  nominated  also  by  the  national
group of Germany and Romania.
to  a  note  by 
I  should  also  like  to  draw  the  attention  of  the
Assembly 
the  Secretary-General,
contained  in  an  addendum  to  document  A/60/187,
which  was  issued  this  morning,  in  which  he  informs
me  that  the  national  group  of  Niger  decided  to
withdraw its nomination of Mr. Seidou Adamou Mazou
as a candidate.
The  Assembly  also  has  before  it  document
A/60/188  and  corrigendum  1,  which  contains  the
curricula  vitae  of  the  candidates  nominated  by  the
national groups.
In accordance with Article 10, paragraph 1, of the
Statute  of  the  Court,  those  candidates  who  obtain  an
absolute  majority  of  votes  both 
the  General
Assembly  and 
the  Security  Council  shall  be
considered as elected.

in 
The consistent practice of the United Nations has
been  to  interpret  the  words  “absolute  majority”  as
meaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they
vote or are allowed to vote. The electors in the General
Assembly are all 191 Member States. Accordingly, for
the  present  election,  96  votes  constitute  an  absolute
majority in the General Assembly.
Pursuant to rule 151 of the rules of procedure of
the  Assembly,  if  in  the  first  ballot  the  number  of
candidates  obtaining  an  absolute  majority  is  less  than
five,  a  second  ballot  will  be  held  and  balloting  will
continue at the same meeting until five candidates have
obtained the required majority.
At its 915th meeting, on 16 November 1960, the
that  ballots  shall  be
followed
General  Assembly  decided 
unrestricted.  That  decision  has  been 
consistently.
I  should  like  to  bring  another  matter  to  the
attention  of  the  General  Assembly.  Cases  have  arisen
in  the  Security  Council  in  which  more  than  the
required  number  of  candidates  have  obtained  an
absolute  majority  on  the  same  ballot.  The  same  also

occurred in the General Assembly, at the 45th plenary
meeting  of  the  fifty-fourth  session,  on  3  November
1999.
Both  organs  decided  to  hold  a  new  ballot  on  all
the  candidates,  and  no  notification  to  the  President  of
the  other  organ  was  made  until  only  the  required
number  of  candidates,  and  no  more,  had  obtained  an
absolute majority.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to
the  same  procedure  should  the  case  arise  at  this
election?
It was so decided.
The  President:
I 
remind
representatives that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of
procedure,
should 
like 
to 
“After  the  President  has  announced  the
beginning  of  voting,  no  representative  shall
interrupt the voting except on a point of order in
connection with the actual conduct of the voting.”
Any  announcements, 
those  concerning
withdrawals of candidatures, should therefore be made
prior to the commencement of the voting process, that
is to say before the announcement of the beginning of
the voting process.
including 
I  should  like  to  seek  the  usual  cooperation  of
representatives  during  the  time  of  the  conduct  of  the
election.  Please  be  reminded  that  during  the  voting
process  all  campaigning  should  cease  in  the  General
Assembly Hall. This means in particular that once the
election has begun no more campaign  material  can  be
distributed inside the Hall. All representatives are also
requested  to  remain  at  their  seats  so  that  the  voting
process  can  proceed  in  an  orderly  manner.  I  thank
representatives in advance for their cooperation.
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Ballot
papers will now be distributed.
Representatives  are  requested  to  use  only  the
ballot  papers  now  being  distributed.  Only 
those
candidates  whose  names  appear  on  the  ballot  papers
are  eligible.  Representatives  will  indicate  the  five
candidates  for  whom  they  wish  to  vote  by  placing
crosses to the left of their names on the ballot papers.
Ballot  papers  on  which  more  than  five  names  are
marked  will  be  considered  invalid.  Votes  may  be  cast
only  for  those  whose  names  appear  on  the  ballot
papers.

In  the  ballot  just  completed,  more  than  five
candidates  —  in  this  case,  six  candidates  —  have
obtained an absolute majority. Pursuant to the decision
taken  by  the  General  Assembly  at  the  45th  plenary
meeting of its fifty-fourth session on 3 November 1999
and  in  accordance  with  the  decision  taken  at  the
beginning  of  this  meeting,  a  new  ballot  will  be  held
until only the required number of candidates — that is,
five and no more — obtains an absolute majority.
We shall therefore proceed to another unrestricted
ballot to fill the five vacancies.
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Ballot
papers will now be distributed.
All  the  candidates  whose  names  appear  on  the
ballot  paper  are  eligible.  May  I  once  again  remind
representatives  that  the  names  of  only  five  candidates

In  the  ballot  just  completed,  more  than  five
candidates  —  in  this  case,  six  candidates  —  have
obtained an absolute majority. Pursuant to the decision
taken  by  the  General  Assembly  at  the  45th  plenary

The meeting resumed at 3.10 p.m.
The  Acting  President: We  will  proceed  to
another unrestricted ballot to fill the five vacancies.
I  should  like  to  inform  representatives  that  the
President  of  the  General  Assembly  has  received  two
letters  dated 
today,  Monday,  7  November  2005,
informing  him  that  the  national  group  of  Sweden  and
Tunisia  wishes 
the  candidature  of
Mr. Abdelfattah Amor.
to  withdraw 
As Mr. Abdelfattah Amor was nominated by only
that  one  national  group,  he  is,  therefore,  no  longer  a
candidate. His name should be deleted from the ballot
paper.
The ballots which will be distributed shortly will
reflect that withdrawal.
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Ballot
papers will now be distributed.
All  the  candidates  whose  names  appear  on  the
ballot  paper  are  eligible.  May  I  once  again  remind

I  have  communicated  the  result  of  the  voting  to
the President of the Security Council.
I have also received a letter from the President of
the Security Council, which reads:
“I have the honour to inform you that at the
5299th  meeting  of  the  Security  Council,  held  on
A/60/PV.44
7 November 2005 for the purpose of electing five
members of the International Court of Justice for
a  term  of  office  beginning  on  6  February  2006,
Mr.  Mohamed  Bennouna,  Mr. 
Thomas
Buergenthal,  Mr.  Kenneth  Keith,  Mr.  Bernardo
Sepúlveda  Amor  and  Mr.  Leonid  Skotnikov
obtained an absolute majority of votes.”
As  a  result  of  the  independent  voting  in  the
Security  Council  and  in  the  General  Assembly,  the
following  five  candidates  have  obtained  an  absolute
majority  in  both  organs:  Mr.  Mohamed  Bennouna,
Mr. Thomas  Buergenthal,  Mr.  Kenneth  Keith,
Mr. Bernardo  Sepúlveda  Amor  and  Mr.  Leonid
Skotnikov. They are therefore duly elected members of
the  International  Court  of  Justice  to  serve  for  a  nine-
year  term  commencing  on  6  February  2006.  I  should
like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  extend  to  them  the
congratulations  of  the  Assembly  on  their  election  and
to thank the tellers for their assistance.
We have thus concluded our consideration of sub-
item (c) of agenda item 111.
