(c) Election of the Executive Director of the United

In  his  note, 
Note by the Secretary-General (A/60/553)
The  Acting  Chairman: 
the
Secretary-General  informs  the  General  Assembly  that
in  its  decision  56/312  of  21  November  2001  the
Assembly  re-elected  Mr.  Klaus  Töpfer  as  Executive
Director  of 
the  United  Nations  Environment
Programme (UNEP) for a four-year term, beginning on
1 February 2002 and ending on 31 January 2006.
In  accordance  with  section  II,  paragraph  2,  of
General  Assembly  resolution  2997  (XXVII)  and
bearing  in  mind  Mr.  Töpfer’s  decision  not  to  seek  a
further  term  as  Executive  Director  of  the  Programme,
the Secretary-General proposes a two-month extension
of  Mr.  Töpfer’s  appointment  until  31  March  2006,
which would allow time to identify a suitable successor
and  ensure  continuity  in  the  work  of  UNEP  and  its
Governing Council.
Accordingly,  may  I  take  it  that  the  General
Assembly  wishes 
to  extend  Mr.  Klaus  Töpfer’s
appointment  as  Executive  Director  of  the  United
Nations Environment Programme for two months, until
the end of March 2006?
It was so decided.
The  Acting  President:  The  General  Assembly
has  thus  concluded  this  stage  of  its  consideration  of
sub-item (c) of agenda item 112.
Reports of the Fifth Committee
The  Acting  President:  The  General  Assembly
will  consider  the  reports  of  the  Fifth  Committee  on
agenda items 113 (a) to (e), 138 and 145.

of procedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly

decision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that:
This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of
speeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original
languages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature
of a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room
C-154A. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.

Under  the  terms  of  draft  resolution  I,  entitled
“Report  of 
the  United  Nations  Commission  on
International Trade Law on the work of its thirty-eighth
session”,  the  General  Assembly  would,  among  others
things,  endorse  the  efforts  and  initiatives  of  the
Commission, as the core legal body within the United
Nations system in the field of international trade law. It
would  also  reaffirm  the  importance,  in  particular  for
developing  countries,  of  the  work  of  the  Commission
concerned  with  technical  assistance  in  the  field  of
international  trade  law  reform  and  development  and
would, in this connection, appeal to Governments, the
relevant  bodies  of 
the  United  Nations  system,
organizations,  institutions  and  individuals  to  make
voluntary contributions to the relevant trust fund and to
support  the  technical  assistance  programme  of  the
Commission.
Furthermore,  the  Assembly  would  encourage  the
Commission to further explore different approaches to
the  use  of  partnerships  with  non-State  actors  in  the
implementation of its mandate, in particular in the area
of technical assistance. The Assembly would also take
note with appreciation of the preparation of digests of
case  law  relating  to  the  texts  of  the  Commission  and
would  welcome  the  Commission’s  decision  to  hold  a
congress on international trade law.
I am pleased to note that draft resolution II under
this  agenda  item  contains  the  annex  to  the  United
Nations  Convention  on 
the  Use  of  Electronic
Communications  in  International  Contracts.  Under  the
terms  of  the  draft  resolution,  the  General  Assembly
would,  after  expressing 
the
Commission for preparing the draft Convention, adopt
the  Convention  and  request  the  Secretary-General  to
open it for signature. It would also call upon States to
consider becoming parties to it. In accordance with its
article  16,  the  Convention  shall  be  open  for  signature
by  all  States  from  16  January  2006  until  16  January
2008.

The  Sixth  Committee  adopted  the  two  draft
resolutions  without  a  vote,  and  it  is  hoped  that  the
Assembly will do the same.
I  now  invite  the  Assembly’s  attention  to  agenda
item 80, “Report of the International Law Commission
on the work of its fifty-seventh session”. The relevant
report of the Sixth Committee is contained in document
A/60/516,  and

By the terms of  the  draft  resolution,  the  General
Assembly  would,  inter  alia,  take  note  of  the  report  of
the  International  Law  Commission  on  the  work  of  its
fifty-seventh session and encourage the Commission to
complete  work  on 
items  which  are  near
completion  at  its  fifty-eighth  session.  The  Assembly
would  draw  the  attention  of  Governments  to  the
importance  for  the  International  Law  Commission  of
having 
the  draft  articles  and
commentary on diplomatic protection and on the draft
principles  on  allocation  of 
the  case  of
transboundary harm arising out of hazardous activities,
both of which were adopted at the fifty-sixth session of
the Commission in 2004.

The  Assembly  would  also  encourage  Member
States  to  consider  being  represented  at  the  level  of
legal adviser during the first week in which the report
of  the  International  Law  Commission  is  discussed  in
the Sixth Committee — International Law Week — so
as  to  enable  high-level  discussions  on  issues  of
international  law.  In  addition,  the  Assembly  would
decide that the next session of the Commission would
be held at the United Nations Office at Geneva from 1
May to 9 June and from 3 July to 11 August 2006.
The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution
without a vote, and it is hoped that the Assembly will
do the same.
I turn now to agenda item 82, entitled “Report of
the  Special  Committee  on  the  Charter  of  the  United
Nations  and  on  the  Strengthening  of  the  Role  of  the
Organization”.  The  report  of  the  Sixth  Committee  on
this item is contained in document A/60/517. The draft
resolution which the Sixth Committee recommends for
adoption  by  the  General  Assembly  is  reproduced  in
paragraph 10 of the report.
By the terms of  the  draft  resolution,  the  General
Assembly  would,  among  other  things,  request  the
A/60/PV.53
Special  Committee,  at  its  next  session  in  2006,  to
continue  its  consideration  of  all  proposals  concerning
the question of the maintenance of international peace
and security in all its aspects in order to strengthen the
role  of  the  United  Nations.  The  Special  Committee
would  also  be  requested  to  continue  to  consider,  on  a
priority basis and in an appropriate substantive manner
and framework, the question of the implementation  of
the  provisions  of  the  Charter  of  the  United  Nations
related  to  assistance  to  third  States  affected  by  the
application  of  sanctions  under  Chapter  VII  of  the
Charter and to consider, also on a priority basis, ways
and  means  of  improving  its  working  methods  and

Additionally,  the  Assembly  would  welcome  the
establishment of the trust fund to eliminate the backlog
of the Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs
and  would  encourage  States 
to  make  voluntary
contributions to it. It would also endorse the Secretary-
General’s  efforts  to  eliminate  the  backlog  of  the
Repertoire of the Practice of the Security Council and
would encourage contributions to the trust fund for its
updating.  It  would  further  request  the  Secretary-
General to submit a report on both publications to the
General Assembly at its sixty-first session.
The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution
without a vote, and I hope that the Assembly will be in
a position to do likewise.
Let me now turn to agenda item 153, “Report of

That concludes my introduction of the reports of
the Sixth Committee at this stage. I would like to take
this opportunity to express my gratitude to Ambassador
Mr.  Juan  Antonio  Yáñez-Barnuevo,  Chairman  of  the
Sixth  Committee,  for  his  hard  work  and  for  the
commendable leadership he provided to the Committee
throughout this session.  I also wish to thank the other
members  of  the  Bureau  —  Mr.  Mahmoud  Hmoud,
Mr.  Mahmoud  Samy  and  Mr.  Grzegorz  Zyman  —  for
their cooperation and the support given to me. Finally,
thanks  and  appreciation  are  also  due 
to  all
representatives  and  colleagues  for  their  invaluable
contributions to the success of this session.
The  Acting  President:  If  there  is  no  proposal

A/60/PV.53
Agenda item 81 (continued)
Report of the International Criminal Court
Draft resolution A/60/L.25
The  Acting  President:  Members  will  recall  that
the  General  Assembly  held  the  debate  on  this  agenda
item at its 46th plenary meeting, on 8 November.
I call on the representative of the Netherlands to
introduce draft resolution A/60/L.25.
Mr. Majoor  (Netherlands):  I  have  the  honour  to
introduce  this  morning  draft  resolution  (A/60/L.25),
entitled “Report of the International Criminal Court”.
In  addition  to  the  countries  listed  in  L.25,  the
following  have  indicated  their  wish  to  be  included  as
sponsors:  Antigua  and  Barbuda,  Barbados,  Colombia,
Georgia  and  Mali.  That  brings  the  total  number  of
sponsors for this resolution to 88.
On 8 November, the President of the International
Criminal Court presented the first annual report of the
Court to this body. We had a very constructive and in-
depth  debate  at  that  time,  and  I  do  not  want  to  repeat
that  discussion  here  today.  Allow  me,  however,  to
highlight just a few elements.
The  report  of  the  International  Criminal  Court
and the debate in this body a few weeks ago underlined
the important role that the Court plays in our common
multilateral  system  that  aims  to  end  impunity  and  to
establish  the  rule  of  law,  to  promote  and  encourage
respect  for  human  rights  and  to  restore  and  maintain
international  peace  and  security.  The  establishment  of
the  Court  was  the  most  significant  development  in
recent years in the long struggle to eradicate impunity.
We are therefore very pleased that substantial progress
has  been  achieved 
fully
operational.  The  annual  report  clearly  demonstrates
that progress.
in  making 
the  Court 
The Court is now at the beginning of the judicial
phase  of  its  operations,  involving  both  operations  in
the  field  and  courtroom  proceedings.  The  issuance  of
arrest  warrants  against  five  leaders  of  the  Lord’s
Resistance Army is a clear indication of that fact. The
referral  by  the  Security  Council  this  spring  of  the
situation 
the  International  Criminal
Court’s Prosecutor and the opening of an investigation
into  that  situation  by  the  Prosecutor  were  other
important milestones. The fact that all Security Council
in  Darfur 
to 
9
A/60/PV.53
members were directly or indirectly supportive of that
referral was a very welcome development, and proof of
the growing support for the Court. The President of the
International  Criminal  Court  in  his  address  to  the
General  Assembly  stressed  the  fact  that  cooperation
between 
the  United  Nations  and
cooperation with States, international organizations and
civil  society  are  fundamental  to  an  effective  and
efficient  functioning  Court,  especially  now  that  the
Court has started the judicial phase of its work. We call
on all concerned to heed his call.
the  Court  and 
While  all  States  are  free  to  choose  whether  to
become a party to the Rome Statute or not, recently we
were happy to  welcome the one-hundredth ratification
of the Statute by Mexico. We will continue to strive for
a  universal  membership  to  the  Rome  Statute  and  it  is
therefore  our  sincere  hope  that  more  States  will  soon
ratify it.
The draft resolution before us today serves three
main  objectives:  first,  to  indicate  political  support  for
the International Criminal Court as an organization, for
its aims and for the work it carries out.
Secondly,  it  underlines  the  importance  of  the
relationship  agreement  concluded  with  the  United
Nations,  which  serves  as  a  framework  for  the  close
cooperation between  the  two  organizations.  Thirdly,  it
serves  to  remind  States  of  the  need  to  cooperate  with
the  International  Criminal  Court  as  it  carries  out  its
tasks.
The  Netherlands  hopes  that  the  adoption  of  the
draft resolution today will lead to even greater support
for the International Criminal Court in its fight against
impunity  and  in  its  attempts  to  hold  those  accused  of
very  serious  crimes  accountable  for  their  actions.  In
that  context,  we  look  forward  to  the  second  annual
report  of  the  International  Criminal  Court  and  its
consideration during next year’s session of the General
Assembly.
The Acting President: We shall now  proceed to
consider draft resolution A/60/L.25. Before giving  the
floor to the speakers in explanation of vote before the
vote,  may  I  remind  delegations  that  explanations  of
vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by
delegations from their seats.
Ms.  Willson  (United  States  of  America):  Our
concerns about the Rome Statute and the International
Criminal Court (ICC) are well known. They include the
10
Court’s  assertion  of  jurisdiction  over  nationals  of
States not parties to the Rome Statute, including United
States nationals, and the lack of adequate oversight of
the Court’s activities, including those of the Prosecutor,
who  may  initiate  cases  without  first  seeking  approval
of the Security Council.
As  in  past  years,  those  concerns  require  the
United  States  to  disassociate  itself  from  consensus  on
the  draft  resolution.  While  our  concerns  about  the
Court  have  not  changed,  we  would  like  to  move
beyond  divisiveness  on  the  issue.  We  share 
the
commitment of parties to the Rome Statute to bring to
justice those who perpetrate genocide, war crimes and
crimes  against  humanity.  While  we  have  honest
differences on how accountability is best achieved, we
must  work  together  to  ensure  that  perpetrators  of  the
atrocities are held accountable for their actions.
forceful 
advocates  of 
The  actions  of  the  United  States  demonstrate
clearly that we have been and continue to be among the
most 
the  principle  of
accountability  for  war  crimes,  genocide  and  crimes
against  humanity.  We  demonstrated  our  willingness  to
work instructively on those matters in connection with
Darfur,  where  it  was  the  United  States  that  concluded
that genocide had occurred and it was the United States
that  called  for  and  supported  the  creation  of  the
International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur.
While  we  would  have  preferred  a  different
mechanism,  we  believed  it  was  important  for  the
international community to speak with one voice and to
act  decisively.  Consequently,  we  accepted  referral  of
the  Darfur  situation  by  the  Security  Council  to  the
Court.  Those  events  demonstrate  that  there  can  be
common  ground  when  both  sides  are  willing  to  work
constructively.
I  would  like  to  emphasize  today  what  we  have
said in the past. We respect the right of other States to
become parties to the Rome Statute. We ask in return,
however,  that  other  States  respect  our  decision  not  to
do  so.  With  respect  to  the  draft  resolution,  we  made
good faith efforts to work with supporters of the Court
on  language  that  would  reflect  that  simple  principle.
We were deeply disappointed that our efforts to turn a
new page were rejected.
As we move forward, we urge Court supporters to
reciprocate  our  efforts  to  seek  common  ground  and
avoid  divisiveness.  In  our  view,  that  begins  with  an
acknowledgement  that  there  are  honest  differences  of
view  on  the  issues  and  an  acknowledgement  of  the
right of the United States and other States to decide not
to become Parties to the Court and not to subject their
citizens and officials to its jurisdiction. That should not
be too much to ask.
The  Acting  President:  We  have  heard  the  only
speaker  in  explanation  of  vote  before  the  vote.  The
Assembly will now take a decision on draft resolution
A/60/L.25. May I take it that the Assembly decides to
adopt draft resolution A/60/L.25?
A/60/PV.53
to 
the  principle  adopted  by 
We  have  noted  in  the  past  the  importance  we
attach 
the  General
Assembly  in  resolution  58/318  that  the  costs  of  any
assistance  or  services  provided  by  the  United  Nations
to  the  Court  must  be  fully  reimbursed  to  the  United
Nations.  We  are  pleased  that  the  sponsors  of  the  draft
resolution were willing to make that clear in the draft.
Efforts  to  include  language  in  resolutions  of  the
General  Assembly  or  Security  Council 
that  are
inconsistent  with  the  basic  respect  for  the  honest
differences  of  views  about  the  Court  serve  only  to
exacerbate divisions and make it more difficult for the
international community to pursue common approaches
in the fight against impunity. Not every issue needs to
be turned into a debate about the role of the Court. It is
our  hope,  as  we  move  forward,  that  efforts  by  all
parties  to  work  constructively  and  in  good  faith  will
allow us to spend less time arguing over the Court and
more  time  working  together  to  ensure  accountability
for serious crimes.
