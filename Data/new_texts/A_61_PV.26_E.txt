Agenda items 72 and 73 

The  President:  May  I  take  it  that  the Assembly 

takes  note  of  the  thirteenth  annual  report  of  the 
International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia? 
  It was so decided. 


The  President:  I  now  call  on  Mr.  Erik  Møse, 
President  of  the  International  Criminal  Tribunal  for 
Rwanda. 

Mr.  Møse:  It  is  a  great  honour  to  address  the 
members  of  the  General Assembly  in  order  to  present 
the eleventh annual report of the International Criminal 
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) (see A/61/265). 

When  the  tenth  report  was  presented  to  the 
Assembly,  one  year  ago,  25  accused  had  received 
judgements. That number has now increased to 31. Of 
the  six  new  judgements,  three  were  delivered  within 
the  period  under  review,  namely,  from  1  July  2005  to 
30 June 2006. Another three judgements were rendered 
in  September  2006,  following  trials  in  the  reporting 
period.  One  further  case  is  presently  at  the  stage  of 
judgement-writing.  To  date, 
judgement  has  been 
rendered, or trials are ongoing, in respect of a total of 
56 alleged leaders of the events in 1994. Let me briefly 
mention the six Trial Chamber judgements I have just 
referred to. 

On  13  December  2005,  Aloys  Simba,  who  in 
1994  was  a  retired  military  officer,  was  unanimously 
convicted  of  genocide  and  crimes  against  humanity, 
and sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment. On 13 April 
2006, Paul Bisengimana, a bourgmestre, was sentenced 
to  15  years  imprisonment,  after  having  pleaded  guilty

to  25  years  of 
A/61/PV.26 

to  crimes  against  humanity.  On  12  June  2006,  Joseph 
Serugendo was convicted, also following a guilty plea, 
for  direct  and  public  incitement  to  commit  genocide 
and  persecution.  He  was  sentenced  to  six  years 
imprisonment. His terminal illness and poor prognosis 
were  taken  into  account  as  a  significant  mitigating 
factor.  Mr.  Serugendo  passed  away  in  hospital  on 
22 August  2006.  Mr.  Bisengimana  and  Mr.  Serugendo 
bring  the  total  number  of  accused  who  have  pleaded 
guilty  before  the  ICTR  to  six.  It  cannot  be  excluded 
that that number may increase further. 

I shall now turn to the three judgements that were 
rendered in September. Jean Mpambara, a bourgmestre, 
was  acquitted  of  all  charges  against  him  on 
12 September  2006.  On 
the  same  day,  Tharcisse 
Muvunyi,  commander  of  the  École  sous-officiers,  was 
convicted of  genocide, direct  and  public incitement to 
commit genocide and crimes against humanity. He was 
sentenced 
imprisonment.  On 
20 September  2006, André  Rwamakuba,  who  was  the 
Rwandan  Minister  of  Primary 
and  Secondary 
Education,  was  acquitted  of  all  charges  against  him. 
The judgments in the Mpambara and Rwamakuba trials 
bring  the  number  of  acquitted  persons  at  the  ICTR  to 
five. 

The ICTR Appeals Chamber delivered one appeal 
judgement in respect of one accused during the period 
under  review.  Two  further  judgements  were  rendered 
immediately  after  the  reporting  period,  in  respect  of 
four  other  accused.  The  Appeals  Chamber  also 
delivered a number of significant interlocutory appeals 
during the reporting period or immediately thereafter. 
Let me turn to the nine trials that are in progress, 

involving  25  accused.  Of 
those  cases,  our  five 
multi-accused  trials  continue  to  represent  our  main 
challenge,  because  of  their  volume  and  complexity 
and, therefore, the time needed to complete them. It is 
therefore important to note that three of them are at an 
advanced stage. 
The  Military  I  case  involves  four  alleged  senior 

military leaders in the Rwandan Armed Forces in 1994. 
The trial is scheduled to conclude in 2006. The Butare
trial  is  the  largest  multi-accused  case  before  the 
Tribunal.  It  has  progressed  favourably,  with 
the 
defence case of the third of the six accused drawing to 
a  close.  In  the  Government  trial,  which  involves  four 
Government ministers, the defence case commenced on 
1 November 2005, and is progressing well. In the two 
other multi-accused trials, the Prosecution is presenting 
its evidence. The Military II trial, which involves four 
accused, is almost at the end of the prosecution case. In 
the complex Karemera et al. case, which also involves 
four  accused,  the  prosecution  case  is  well  under  way. 
The  progress  made  in  the  Tribunal’s  multi-accused 
trials represents significant steps in the implementation 
of the ICTR completion strategy. 

Developments  in  the  single-accused  cases  have 
also been encouraging. During the period under review, 
the  ICTR  commenced  three  new  trials  involving  three 
accused. I have already mentioned the Mpambara trial, 
which  started  on  19  September  2005  and  in  which 
judgement was rendered last month. In the Karera trial, 
which began on 9 January 2006, closing arguments will 
be heard in November this year. The Zigiranyirazo trial 
started  on  3  October  2005,  and  the  defence  case  will 
commence soon. 

Another  welcome  development  is  that,  since  the 
submission  of  the  annual  report,  two  new  single-
accused  trials  have  started.  The  Bikindi  and  the 
Nchamihigo  cases  began  on  18  and  25  September 
2006,  respectively. A  third  new  single-accused  case  is 
scheduled to commence in November this year. 
In  addition  to  the  56  persons  with  ongoing  or 

completed 
the 
commencement  of  their  cases.  One  trial  will  start  in 
November  of  this  year,  and  another  in  January  2007. 
The  remaining  cases  will  commence  as  soon  as  trial 
capacity allows. 
On  that  basis,  I  am  pleased  to  confirm  that  the 

ICTR  is  on  schedule  to  complete  cases  involving 
between  65  and  70  accused  by  the  end  of  2008,  as 
envisaged  in  our  completion  strategy.  In  order  to 
achieve  that  aim,  continuity  is  of  the  essence.  Earlier 
this year, the ICTR therefore requested that the term of 
office of the permanent judges be extended to the end 
of 2008, instead of proceeding with elections. That was 
supported by the Secretary-General. The ICTR is very 
grateful  to  the  General  Assembly,  which  on  28  June 
2006 endorsed that recommendation. 

More  recently,  the  ICTR  requested  a  similar 
extension of the term of office of the ad litem judges. 
The purpose is the same: to provide the Tribunal with 
the continuity, stability and certainty necessary for the 
efficient and effective planning of trials. In his letter of 
2  October 
the 
the  Secretary-General  requested 
General Assembly, 
trials,  12  detainees  are  awaiting 
the  President 
of

to

06-55951 


that the Assembly approve the extension of the term of 
office  of  all  ad  litem  judges  until  the  end  of  2008. 
Approval is also requested to allow nine of the ad litem 
judges  to  serve  beyond  the  three-year  cumulative 
period  provided  for  under  article  12  ter  (2)  of  the 
Statute. 

The members of the General Assembly may wish 
to  take  into  consideration  that  the  cumulative  three-
year period for two of the judges expires on 27 October 
2006. Approval of that general request before that date 
would avert the need to authorize individual judges to 
continue  to  serve  in  trials  to  which  they  are  currently 
assigned. Allow me, in that connection, to express our 
appreciation to the Assembly for having, on 29 August 
2006, authorized one of the judges to continue to serve 
for more than three years in relation to the Butare trial. 

Another  important  element  of  the  completion 
strategy  is  the  Prosecutor’s  intention  to  transfer  some 
ICTR  indictees  to  national  jurisdictions  for  trial. 
Eighteen  indictees  are  at  large.  The  ICTR  will  not  be 
able to prosecute all those accused by December 2008, 
should  they  be  found.  The  Prosecutor  is  presently 
focusing on some of them. It is essential that Member 
States assist and cooperate in the arrest and transfer of 
accused  who  remain  at  large.  One  particularly  well-
known  indictee  is  Félicien  Kabuga.  In  view  of  the 
ICTR  completion  strategy,  it  is  important  that  he  be 
arrested and transferred to Arusha as soon as possible, 
in order to determine his guilt or innocence. 

In  order  to  prevent  impunity,  Member  States  are 
encouraged  to  be  receptive  to  discussions  concerning 
the  possible  transfer  of  some  trials  to  their  respective 
jurisdictions. The  Prosecutor  has  been  in  contact  with 
several countries. The decision as to whether a transfer 
shall  take  place  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Trial 
Chambers.  A  decision  of  principle  was  made  in  the 
Bagaragaza  case,  in  which  a  Trial  Chamber  and  the 
Appeals Chamber clarified the scope of the jurisdiction 
required in order for States to prosecute ICTR cases at 
the national level. 

In  connection  with  State  cooperation,  I  would 
also  like  to  recall  that  only  one  of  the  five  acquitted 
persons  has  found  a  country  of  residence.  The  other 
four are under the protection of the Tribunal in Arusha. 
The  situation 
for  André 
Ntagerura  and  Emmanuel  Bagambiki,  who  were 
acquitted by the Trial Chamber on 25 February 2004 — 
more  than  two  and  a  half  years  ago.  The  Appeals 
is  particularly  serious 
A/61/PV.26
Chamber  confirmed  their  acquittal  in  July  2006.  The 
Tribunal has, without success, made many attempts to 
find  a  country  for  them.  On  behalf  of  the  Tribunal,  I 
appeal  to  Member  States  to  receive  acquitted  persons 
in their territories. 

During the reporting period, Rwanda continued to 
cooperate  with  the  ICTR  by  facilitating  the  travel  of 
witnesses and by providing documents for use at trial, 
both  for  the  prosecution  and  for  the  defence.  It  is 
important  that  requests  in  this  field  be  dealt  with 
expeditiously  and  in  a  flexible  way.  The  Tribunal 
expects  this  cooperation  to  continue,  too,  if  there 
should  be  issues  in  relation  to  which  there  may  be 
differences  of  opinion  between  Kigali  and  Arusha. 
Some recent problems have been solved. 

The Registry has continued to support the judicial 
process by servicing the other branches of the Tribunal. 
I refer to the annual report for details, but let me stress 
the important work done by all sections, including the 
various  units  within  the  Court  Management  Section, 
the Witness Protection Section, the Language Services 
Section, the Defence Counsel Section and the Security 
Section.  Let  me  further  emphasize  that  the  important 
work  of  the  defence  teams  is  greatly  appreciated  as  a 
cornerstone in our judicial proceedings. 

The  ICTR  outreach  programme,  which  includes 
our Information Centre in  Kigali, judicial visits to the 
ICTR  and  capacity-building  for  members  of 
the 
Rwandan  judiciary  and  universities,  has  continued  to 
grow.  An  important  part  of  the  programme  is  the 
training  of  Rwandan  jurists,  advocates  and  human 
rights practitioners. 

I  hope  that  I  have  conveyed  an  overview  of  the 
activities  in  a  very  active  Tribunal.  This  week,  about 
20 accused will be brought from the detention facilities 
to  our  four  court  rooms  every  day.  The  ICTR  is 
working at full speed. 

expressing  our  deep  appreciation 
Assembly  and 
continued support of the ICTR. 

The  President: I  call  on  Mr.  Fausto  Pocar, 
President of the International Criminal Tribunal for the 
Former Yugoslavia. 

Mr. Pocar: I am greatly honoured to address the 
Assembly  today  as  President  of  the  International 
Criminal  Tribunal  for  the  Former  Yugoslavia  and

I 
change 
last  October, 
a  period  of 
A/61/PV.26 

present to the Assembly the thirteenth annual report of 
the International Tribunal. This is my first report to the 
Assembly,  as 
took  office  as  President  on 
17 November  2005.  Before  I  highlight  key  aspects  of 
the  report  and  update  the  Assembly  on  some  of  the 
work of the Tribunal subsequent to the report, I would 
like  to  thank  the  members  of  the  Assembly  for  the 
crucial support they have given to the historic work of 
the  Tribunal  since  its  inception.  It  is  only  because  of 
their  assistance  and  ongoing  commitment  that  the 
Tribunal  has  been  able  to  have  such  a  fundamental 
impact  upon  the  development  and  enforcement  of 
international  criminal  justice,  to  advance  the  rule  of 
law  in  national  jurisdictions  in  the  former  Yugoslavia 
and  to  contribute  to  lasting  peace  and  stability  in  the 
region. 
By  way  of  overview,  since  the  report  of  my 

the  Tribunal  has  gone 
predecessor 
through 
significant 
and 
unprecedented  challenges.  Nevertheless,  the  Tribunal 
has  pushed  forward  a  number  of  innovative  reforms 
and adopted concrete measures to increase the efficient 
disposal  of  trials  and  appeals,  without  sacrificing  due 
process. As a result, at one point this year the Tribunal 
was  able  to  try,  for  the  first  time  in  its  history,  an 
unprecedented  number  of  25  accused 
six 
simultaneous  trials.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  three 
large,  multi-accused  trials  involving  21  accused  — 
namely, Prlic and others, concerning crimes committed 
in  Bosnia;  Milutinovic  and  others,  concerning  crimes 
in  Kosovo;  and  Popovic  and  others 
committed 
concerning  crimes  committed 
in  Srebrenica  — 
commenced in April and July 2006, at least six months 
earlier than originally planned, allowing for them to be 
able to finish in 2008. 
Furthermore,  the  Tribunal’s  efforts  to  speed  up 

proceedings  have  resulted 
is 
diminishing at an increasing rate. To date, cases against 
97  accused,  out  of  a  total  of  161  indicted,  have  been 
finally  closed.  While  proceedings  against  64  accused 
remain  to  be  completed,  of  that  number,  15  have 
already been tried and are at the appeals stage, 24 are 
currently on trial and only 15 are in the pretrial stage. 
Four are pending Rule 11 bis motions for referral, and 
the remaining six accused are still at large. 

By the end of this year, the Tribunal is scheduled 
to close proceedings against two more accused with the 
issuance of two appeals judgements, resulting in a total 
of  eight  proceedings  being  closed  on  appeal  in  the 
in  a  caseload 
that 
in 
calendar  year. This  marks  the  most  productive  year  in 
the history of the Appeals Chamber. In the first quarter 
of  2007,  the  Tribunal  will  finish  trials  against  four 
accused and close proceedings against four accused on 
appeal. At the current rate, all trials of accused now in 
the  custody  of  the  Tribunal  are  scheduled  to  be 
completed no later than 2009. 

I  would  like  to  add,  however,  that  while  this 
projected  date  for  the  completion  of  trials  is  a 
noteworthy achievement, the Tribunal is not content to 
accept  that  date  as  final.  It  is  constantly  looking  for 
new, creative ways to complete trials even earlier than 
planned,  while  upholding  due  process  norms.  We 
intend  to  work  harder  than  ever  to  ensure  that 
proceedings  against  the  accused  will  be  completed  as 
soon as possible. 

I  wish  to  underline  that  efficient  completion  of 
the work of the Tribunal is not only a matter of meeting 
completion  strategy  target  dates.  It  is  also  a  matter  of 
respecting  fundamental  human  rights  norms.  Because 
of the increased pace of proceedings over the past year, 
the rights of the accused to be tried expeditiously, and 
to  not  be  held  in  pretrial  detention  for  unduly  lengthy 
periods of time, are respected more effectively. 

I  now  turn  to  summarize  specific  aspects  of  the 
work  of  the  Tribunal  during  the  reporting  period, 
beginning  first  with  Chambers.  The  Trial  Chambers 
issued  447  decisions  on  pretrial  motions,  heard  two 
cases  of  contempt  and  rendered  judgments  in  four 
cases.  The  Tribunal’s  Appeals  Chamber  rendered 
112 pre-appeal  decisions  and  orders,  32  decisions  on 
interlocutory  appeals, 
judgements  and  one 
decision 
judgement. 
Furthermore,  Chambers  issued  five  rule  ll  bis  referral 
decisions  involving  the  transfer  of  nine  low-  to 
mid-level  accused  to  national  jurisdictions  in  the 
region  as  part  of  the  ongoing  policy  to  focus  on  the 
prosecution of the most senior accused. All but one of 
these decisions were also considered on appeal. 

In  addition  to  their  caseload,  judges  of  the 
Tribunal were occupied with a number of extraordinary 
plenaries,  which  I  convened  for  the  sole  purpose  of 
implementing 
the 
efficiency  of  Tribunal  proceedings  without  sacrificing 
due  process.  These  plenaries  were  assisted  by  the 
reports  of  two  working  groups  of  judges,  who  were 
tasked with examining existing practices and the Rules 
internal  reforms  for 
reconsideration 
increasing 
four 
on 
of 
a

of  Procedure  and  Evidence  with  a  view  to  offering 
concrete proposals for improving them. 

The  working  group  on  speeding  up  appeals 
completed  its  report  and  presented  a  package  of 
recommended  amendments  to  the  Rules,  which  were 
unanimously adopted by the judges in a plenary held in 
November  2005.  These  amendments  have  resulted  in 
shortening  the  time  limits  for  the  filing  of  appeals, 
avoiding repetitious filings and expediting the disposal 
of appeals by expanding the use of written, as opposed 
to  oral,  submissions.  Details  of  these  amendments  are 
to be found in report, to which I will refer. 

The  working  group  on  speeding  up  trials  also 
completed its comprehensive report detailing measures 
for  increasing  the  efficiency  of  the  Tribunal’s  trials. 
The working group’s proposals focused on ways judges 
can make a fundamental shift in their conduct of trials, 
away  from  a  party-driven  process  to  a  judicially 
controlled  process,  with  only  minimal  amendments  to 
the existing Rules. Again, details of these measures are 
to be found in the Tribunal’s fifth completion strategy 
report to the Security Council (S/2006/353). However, 
I will highlight some of these significant measures for 
you. 

In April 2006, judges of the Tribunal adopted the 
recommendations  of  the  working  group  on  pretrial 
proceedings and, as a result, pretrial judges are playing 
a much more active role in preparing cases for trial and 
in ensuring that cases are trial-ready upon the vacancy 
of  courtrooms.  In  the  conduct  of  pretrial  conferences, 
pretrial  judges  are  insisting  on  the  establishment  of 
workplans  that  set  strict  deadlines  on  the  parties’ 
disclosure of material and reaching agreement on facts. 
The  pretrial  judges  are  also  requiring  the  Prosecution 
to  provide  greater  details  on  its  trial  strategy  and 
obliging  both  parties  to  file  their  pretrial  briefs  and 
witness  and  exhibit  lists  well  before  the  start  of  their 
cases. 

Furthermore,  a  new  policy  has  been  adopted 
whereby,  wherever  possible,  cases  are  assigned  at  the 
pretrial  stage  to  a  judge  who  is  expected  to  be  one  of 
the  judges  who  will  hear  the  case  at  trial. As  a  result, 
not  only  are  pretrial  judges  taking  increased  measures 
to  efficiently  prepare  a  case  for  trial,  but  Trial 
Chambers  have  also  been  encouraged  to  require  the 
Prosecution  to  focus  its  case  at  trial  by  limiting  the 
presentation  of  evidence  and  fixing  the  number  of 
crimes sites or incidents. The policy of pretrial judges 
A/61/PV.26
scope 
of 
limits  upon 
sitting  on  trial  was  applied  to  the  two  multi-accused 
cases of Prlic et al. and Milutinovic et al, and resulted 
in greater efficiency in both. 

Following the working group’s recommendations 
for  enhancing  the  efficiency  of  trials,  in  addition  to 
pretrial  proceedings,  the  judges  of  the  Tribunal  were 
recently  convened  in  another  extraordinary  plenary  in 
September  2006  to  adopt  amendments  to  the  Rules 
incorporating  those  proposals.  That  plenary  led  to  the 
adoption by the judges of two new provisions, rules 92 
ter  and  92  quater.  In  essence,  the  amendments  have 
increased  the  ability  of  Trial  Chambers  to  consider 
written  statements  and  transcripts  of  witnesses  in  lieu 
of oral testimony, even where that evidence goes to the 
acts  and  conducts  of  an  accused.  Trial  Chambers  are 
now  empowered  to  decide  whether  a  witness  should 
appear for cross-examination where written statements 
or transcripts have been used, and whether to allow the 
admission of written evidence of witnesses who are not 
available to attend as witnesses at the Tribunal. 
The  judges  have  also  taken  action  to  expedite 

trial  proceedings  by  placing 
the 
Prosecution’s  cases,  such  as  by  narrowing  the  breadth 
and 
indictments. 
Accordingly,  in  May  2006,  the  judges  adopted  an 
amendment to rule 73 bis to authorize Trial Chambers 
to either invite or direct the Prosecutor to select those 
counts  in  the  indictment  on  which  to  proceed.  The 
judges  of 
this  rule 
amendment  was  necessary  in  order  to  ensure  respect 
for an accused’s right to a fair and expeditious trial and 
to prevent unduly lengthy periods of pretrial detention. 
Moreover,  if  the Tribunal  is  to  come  close  to  meeting 
completion strategy targets, it will be necessary for the 
Prosecution’s  case  to  be  limited.  Regrettably,  the 
Prosecutor  strongly  opposed  this  amendment,  even 
though  focusing  the  scope  of  indictments  is  part  of 
responsible  trial  management,  is  commonly  used  in 
national 
impact  upon 
prosecutorial prerogatives. 

Recognizing that it is critical that judges and the 
Prosecution  work  together  in  order  to  complete  the 
work  of  the Tribunal, Trial  Chambers  have  worked  to 
build  consensus  with  the  Prosecutor  by  finding  other 
ways  to  focus  her  cases,  apart  from  mandatorily 
directing  her  to  narrow  the  scope  of  her  indictments. 
For  example,  strict  time  limits  have  been  set  for  the 
presentation  of  the  Prosecution’s  cases  in  Prlic  and 
the 
Milutinovic, 
jurisdictions  and  does  not

anticipated length of trial by at least one third and one 
half, respectively. In addition, in these cases, as well as 
in  Popovic  et  al,  the  Trial  Chambers  have  placed 
restrictions  on  the  amount  of  evidence  that  may  be 
adduced  in  relation  to  some  of  the  counts  in  the 
indictments. 

In  the  Seselj  case,  while  the  Trial  Chamber  is 
examining  the  indictment  for  purposes  of  reducing  its 
scope  by  one  third,  it  has  invited  the  Prosecutor  to 
make proposals for that purpose. 
As a final note with regard to the judicial work of 

the  Tribunal  during  this  reporting  period,  I  draw  the 
attention  of 
to  Security  Council 
resolution 1660 (2006), adopted on 28 February 2006. 
That resolution allows the Secretary-General to appoint 
ad  litem  reserve  judges  to  the  three  larger  trials  of 
multi-accused. These  judges  are  available  to  replace  a 
judge who is unable to continue sitting on a case and, 
thus,  to  prevent  the  delay  that  would  be  caused  by 
having  to  restart  the  trial.  Moreover,  these  reserve 
judges  are  being  assigned  to  other  cases  to  hear  them 
as ad litem judges proper or to do pretrial work. Their 
contribution  to  the  efficient  work  of  the  Tribunal 
cannot be overstated. 

Let  me  now  turn  to  the  activity  of  the  Office  of 
the  Prosecutor  over  the  past  year.  In  accordance  with 
the Tribunal’s  completion  strategy,  there  were  no  new 
indictments — except for contempt of court — issued 
by  the  Office  of  the  Prosecutor  during  the  reporting 
period. The Prosecutor focused her efforts on obtaining 
cooperation 
and 
international 
the  arrest  or 
surrender  of  the  remaining  fugitives.  Notably,  in  the 
second  half  of  2005,  Milan  Lukic,  Dragan  Zelenovic 
and  Ante  Gotovina  were  arrested  and  subsequently 
transferred to the Tribunal. 

However,  I  must  emphasize  that  it  is  of  grave 
concern to the Tribunal that six high-level fugitives — 
in  particular,  Radovan  Karadzic  and  Ratko  Mladic  — 
remain  at large. The Tribunal must not  close its doors 
before those accused are brought to justice. Otherwise, 
the Tribunal’s message and legacy that the international 
community  will  not  tolerate  serious  violations  of 
international humanitarian law will be thwarted. 

I  stress  that  the  capacity  of  the  Tribunal  to 
complete  its  mandate  in  accordance  with  the  target 
dates  of  the  completion  strategy  hinges  significantly 
upon  the  immediate  cooperation  of  all  States  — 
relevant  Governments 
from 
institutions 
to  secure 
towards 
fugitives 
to  stand 
trial.  Regrettably, 
specifically  those  in  the  region  —  in  apprehending 
these 
the 
authorities of Serbia have failed to make any progress 
in locating, arresting and surrendering Ratko Mladic to 
the  International  Tribunal,  despite  a  number  of 
promises  made  and  the  passing  of  several  deadlines. 
Likewise,  no  progress 
locating  Radovan 
Karadzic has been made by the Republika Srpska. 

Another issue of great importance to the Tribunal 
with  respect  to  cooperation  with  States  in  the  former 
Yugoslavia concerns the furtherance of the rule of law 
in national courts in the region. In the reporting period, 
the  Tribunal  increased  its  involvement  in  the  region 
through  working  visits  and  training  programmes  to 
enhance  the  judicial  and  prosecutorial  capacity  of 
national  jurisdictions  and  the  profile  of  the Tribunal’s 
work.  I  firmly  believe  that  that  activity  is  a  key 
component  of  the  mission  and  the  legacy  of  the 
Tribunal. It is these courts that will continue the work 
of  the  Tribunal  in  trying  perpetrators  of  war  crimes, 
crimes against humanity and genocide. Furthermore, it 
is crucial, for reasons of stability and reconciliation in 
the region, that these national trials uphold the highest 
standards of due process such that justice is done and is 
seen to be done. 

I would also note that, at present, development of 
the  rule  of  law  in  the  former  Yugoslavia  is  also 
necessary 
the  Tribunal’s 
completion strategy. If fair trials for low- to mid-level 
accused transferred to the region under Rule ll bis are 
not guaranteed, they may be referred back to stand trial 
before the Tribunal under the Rules.  

Last,  but  certainly  not  least,  the  Registry  of  the 
International Tribunal  continued  to  play  a  crucial  role 
at the Tribunal by providing administrative and judicial 
support. Moreover, the Registry worked successfully to 
enhance public interest in the Tribunal by carrying out 
a  diverse  range  of  public  relations  activities  in  the 
former  Yugoslavia  via 
the  Outreach  Programme, 
producing a number of publications in the languages of 
the  region  and  implementing  and  participating  in 
conferences, 
tables  and  workshops.  The 
Outreach  Programme  also  brought  numerous  persons 
and groups from the region to the seat of the Tribunal, 
frequently  through  the  support  and  cooperation  of 
Member States. 

The Registry Advisory Section pursued the action

the  Tribunal’s  archives.  It  is  anticipated  that  the 
entirety  of  the  Tribunal’s  public  case  law  will  be 
available online on the Judicial Database by the end of 
2006. 

Let  me  add  that  the  Registry  continued  to 
facilitate the rights of defendants through a diverse and 
competent force of defence counsel, defence assistants 
and  experts.  Cooperation  and  coordination  with 
defence  counsel  has  improved,  and  the  Registry  is

During  the  reporting  period,  the  United  Nations 
Detention  Unit  was  operating  at  a  high  activity  level, 
especially  following  the  deaths  of  Mr.  Milan  Babic,  a 
detained  witness  previously  convicted  by  the  ICTY 
who  committed  suicide  on  5  March  2006,  and  of 
Mr. Slobodan Milosevic, who died of natural causes on 
11 March  2006.  An  audit  conducted  thereafter  by 
representatives  of  the  Swedish  Government  found  the 
quality of care and security to be generally positive in 
the Unit, but also made a number of recommendations, 
which  are  currently  being  implemented  by  a  working 
group of the Tribunal. 
In  conclusion,  the  thirteenth  annual  report  to  the 

Assembly  demonstrates 
the 
significant  challenges  encountered  over  the  past  year, 
the International Tribunal pressed full speed ahead with 
its judicial and prosecutorial work, resulting in a very 
productive period in the Tribunal’s history. I stress that, 
as demonstrated by the concrete measures taken during 
the  reporting  period, 
is  absolutely 
committed  to  doing  all  within  its  power  to  meet  its 
obligations  under  the  completion  strategy,  while,  of 
course, upholding norms of due process. In looking to 
the  future,  the  International  Tribunal  will  make  every 
effort  to  develop  additional  tools  to  improve  the 
efficiency  of  its  trial  and  appeals  proceedings.  In 
addition,  it  will  intensify  the  ongoing  efforts  to 
contribute 
judicial  and 
prosecutorial capacity in the former Yugoslavia. 

Once  again,  I  emphasize  that  the  noteworthy 
achievements  of  the  International  Tribunal  thus  far 
that,  notwithstanding

I  cannot  stress  enough  how 
have been possible because of the steadfast support of 
members  of  the  General  Assembly.  Through  their 
assistance, the Tribunal has demonstrated to the world 
that  international  criminal  justice  that  upholds  due-
process  norms  is  possible.  The  existence  of  the 
Tribunal  and  its  success  in  prosecuting  war  crimes, 
crimes against humanity and genocide over the past 13 
years  have  sent  a  clear  message  that  the  international 
community  is  committed  to  preventing  such  crimes 
from  going  unpunished.  Furthermore,  the  experience 
and jurisprudence of the Tribunal  have  paved the way 
for 
serious  violations  of 
international  humanitarian  law  in  jurisdictions  around 
the globe. 

the 
Assembly’s  continued  support  will  be  in  the  last  few 
years  of  the  Tribunal’s  mandate.  We  still  have  much 
work to do. I call upon all Member States to assist us in 
our  commitment  to  seeing  that  work  through  to  the 
end,  which  includes  the  trials  of  our  six  remaining 
high-level  accused,  and  in  particular  Mladic  and 
Karadzic. That is not only necessary to ensure that the 
historic  work  of  the  Tribunal  is  not  undermined  by  a 
premature  closing  of  its  doors.  More  important,  it  is 
essential  for  the  cause  of  international  justice  and  the 
continued  fight  against  impunity  in  the  interests  of 
promoting international peace and security.

Ms.  Lintonen  (Finland):  I  have  the  honour  to

acceding  countries  Bulgaria  and  Romania, 
the 
candidate  countries  Turkey,  Croatia  and  The  former

country  Iceland,  member  of  the  European  Economic 
Area,  as  well  as  Ukraine  and  Moldova,  align 
themselves with this statement. 

Let me express the European Union’s continuous 
and strong support for both ad hoc Tribunals and their 
important  work

A/61/PV.26 

the  Tribunals  have  decisively  contributed 
the 
development  of  international  law  and  legal  practice. 
The Tribunals have built up extensive jurisprudence in 
international  criminal  law,  including  several  ground-
breaking precedents. 

It  has  been  established  in  the  case  law  of  the 
International  Criminal  Tribunal  for  Rwanda  (ICTR) 
that  acts  of  rape  and  sexual  violence  committed  with 
the  intent  to  destroy  a  protected  group  can  as  such 
constitute  genocide.  In  addition,  the  line  between 
speech that incites genocide or persecution and speech 
that is protected by the freedom of expression has been 
established.  The  EU  commends  those  developments. 
However, there is still work to be done before we can 
close the chapter on these pioneering Tribunals. 

The EU wishes to warmly thank the Presidents of 
the  International  Criminal  Tribunal  for  the  Former 
Yugoslavia  (ICTY)  and  the  ICTR,  Judges  Pocar  and 
Møse,  for  presenting  their  respective  reports  on  the 
work  of  the  Tribunals.  The  reporting  period  has  been 
very productive for both Tribunals. The EU is pleased 
to note the Tribunals’ efforts to use their capacity to the 
fullest.  We  also  note  that  the  Tribunals  are  making 
progress  on  their  completion  strategies. The  EU  urges 
them to continue to make their proceedings even more 
efficient and expeditious. We recognize, however, that 
efforts  to  enhance  the  administration  of  justice  should 
never  be  made  at  the  expense  of  due  process  and  the 
rights of the accused and of the victims. 

The  decisions  by  the  Security  Council  to  allow 
ICTY  ad  litem  judges  to  serve  as  reserve  judges, 
together  with  the  decisions  by  the  Council  and  the 
General Assembly to extend the terms of office of the 
ICTR’s  permanent  judges,  were  very  well  reasoned. 
The European Union also supports the extension of the 
terms  of  office  of  all  18  ad  litem  judges  of  the  ICTR 
until the end of 2008, as requested by the President of 
the Tribunal and endorsed by the Secretary-General in 
his  recent  letters  to  the  Presidents  of  the  General 
Assembly and the Security Council, respectively. 

The  Tribunals  cannot  succeed  without  the  firm 
commitment  of  States  to  cooperate  with  them  in 
accordance  with  their  legal  obligations.  It  is  vital  that 
that commitment be strengthened and continued as the 
Tribunals approach the final stages of their work. 

The  EU  notes  with  satisfaction  the  arrest  of 
Mr. Ante Gotovina, in December 2005, and his transfer 
to  The  Hague,  as  well  as  the  transfer  of  Mr.  Dragan 
the 
remaining 
to  The  Hague 
in  June.  However, 
the  Tribunals  will  not  be 
unless 
the 
Zelenovic 
fully 
mandates  of 
implemented 
high-level 
fugitives —  in  particular,  Radovan  Karadzic,  Ratko 
Mladic and Félicien Kabuga — are brought before the 
ICTY  and  ICTR,  as  appropriate.  The  EU  therefore 
reiterates its strong call upon all Member States to live 
up  to  their  international  obligations  by  arresting  and 
transferring  the  accused  at  large  to  The  Hague  or  to 
Arusha  without  delay.  Continuing  delays  in  transfers 
also puts in jeopardy the timely implementation of the 
completion strategies. 

The  international  community  must  not  send  the 
message  that  the  perpetrators  of  the  most  serious 
international  crimes  of  genocide,  war  crimes  and 
crimes  against  humanity  can  go  unpunished  by  virtue 
of the passage of time. Impunity is not an option. The 
full  cooperation  of Western  Balkan  countries  with  the 
ICTY  is  a  precondition  for  rapprochement  with  the 
European Union. 

Cooperation  with  the  Tribunals  goes  beyond 
transfer  of  the  accused.  Member  States  are  needed  to 
relocate  witnesses  and  sentenced  persons,  as  well  as 
individuals  who  have  been  acquitted.  Situations  in 
which  witnesses  and  acquitted  persons  wait  in  safe 
houses  for  months  before  being  transferred  are  not 
acceptable. 

More  Member  States  are  also  needed  to  accept 
convicted  persons  to  serve  sentences  in  their  prisons, 
as  dozens  of  cases  requiring  the  enforcement  of 
judgements  are  still  foreseen  in  respect  of  the  ICTY 
alone. The EU therefore strongly  encourages States to 
conclude agreements with the Tribunals relating to the 
relocation  of  witnesses  and  to  the  enforcement  of 
sentences. 

The  European  Union  also  strongly  urges  the 
United  Nations  Interim  Administration  Mission  in 
Kosovo (UNMIK) to fully cooperate with the Office of 
the  Prosecutor  of  the  ICTY.  It  is  of  the  utmost 
importance that the Organization’s own bodies lead the 
way in this respect. 

The  EU  welcomes  the  fact  that  the  ICTY  is 
referring  an  increasing  number  of  cases  involving 
intermediate  and  lower-ranking  accused  to  competent 
national  jurisdictions,  and  expresses  the  hope  that  the 
ICTR  will  soon  be  in  a  position  to  do  likewise.  The 
Tribunals should, indeed, according to their mandates, 
concentrate  on  prosecuting  and  adjudicating  on  senior

responsible 
implementation  of

Tribunals’ jurisdiction. 

The EU agrees that the referrals are important for 
the  successful 
the  completion 
strategies,  as  well  as  for  the  legacy  of  the  Tribunals. 
The  EU  notes,  however,  that  the  trials  need  to  be 
conducted 
international 
standards  of  due  process.  The  Tribunals  will  play  a 
vital role in monitoring to ensure that that is the case, 
and they should be prepared to recall cases if it is not. 
The EU is very conscious that a number of legacy 

issues 
to  be 
addressed. We look forward to seeing the proposals of 
the Secretariat as soon as possible. 
The  EU  welcomes  the  Tribunals’  strengthened 

outreach  activities  and  their  cooperation  with  local 
courts,  including  the  provision  of  training  to  local 
judges.  The  EU  encourages  the  Tribunals  to  continue 
their efforts in this respect. The EU takes careful note 
of  the  call  by  the  Tribunals  for  more  support  from 
Member  States  in  building  the  capacity  of  national 
judicial  institutions.  It  is  money  well  invested  for  the 
international  community,  as  it  enables  the  States  in 
question  not  only  to  adjudicate  the  cases,  but  to  also 
carry on the legacy of the Tribunals. 

Mr.  Adsett  (Canada)  (spoke  in  French):  I  have 
the honour to speak on behalf of Canada, Australia and 
New Zealand. 

I  should  like  to  begin  by  paying  tribute  to  the 
International  Criminal  Tribunal  for  Rwanda  (ICTR) 
and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former 
Yugoslavia 
those 
Tribunals  was  a  milestone 
international 
community’s efforts to replace the culture of impunity, 
which was the norm for most of the twentieth century, 
with a culture of accountability for war crimes, crimes 
against humanity and genocide. Our countries strongly 
support both Tribunals, and commend them for having 
completed  proceedings  against  112  accused  to  date. 
That is a historic achievement.

their  completion  strategies.  Canada, 
Australia and New Zealand will monitor their progress 
closely. We welcome the steps that both Tribunals have 
taken in the past year to improve the efficiency of their 
proceedings, 
judicial 
processes  and  focusing  on  those  who  bearing  the

(spoke in English) 

The  completion  strategies  of  the  ICTY  and  the 
ICTR depend on the ability of the Tribunals themselves 
to  remain  focused  on  meeting  the  important  deadlines 
therein  and  on  the  arrest  by  States  of  indictees  who 
remain  at  large.  The  arrest  and  transfer  of  these 
individuals, 
including  Radovan  Karadzic,  Ratko 
Mladic  and  Félicien  Kabuga,  must  remain  a  top 
priority 
the 
international  community  as  a  whole.  We  call  on  all 
States,  particularly  those  States  where  fugitives  are 
believed  to  be  located,  substantially  to  increase  their 
efforts to arrest indictees. 

As  the  ICTY  and  ICTR  continue  to  wind  down 
their work, there is a clear need for a coordinated and 
standardized  plan  of  action  to  address  issues  that  will 
arise after the physical closure of the Tribunals, such as 
where  appeals  may  be  heard  should  new  evidence  be 
found, 
long-term  retention  and  protection  of 
evidence, the execution of outstanding arrest warrants, 
ongoing witness protection and the secure archiving of 
case  documents.  These  issues  must  be  dealt  with 
properly in order to secure the legacies of the Tribunals 
and  to  ensure  the  transition  of  States  from  conflict  to 
peace. 

With  a  view  to  prompting  strategic  thinking  on 
these  residual  issues,  in  early  2007  Canada  will 
sponsor a small workshop, which we hope will provide 
an  opportunity  for  further  discussion  of  these  issues 
among experts. 

Canada, Australia and New Zealand will continue 
to  assist  the  ICTY  and  the  ICTR  in  carrying  out  their 
mandates  successfully  and  in  holding  accountable 
those  responsible  for  the  worst  crimes  known  to 
humankind. We  call  on  all  States  likewise  to  continue 
to  cooperate  with  the Tribunals  as  they  move  towards 
completing  their  mandates.  Bringing  perpetrators  of 
serious  international  crimes  to  justice  is  an  important 
element  of  long-term  peace  and  reconciliation  in  any 
conflict. 

Mr.  Nsengimana  (Rwanda):  We  would  like  to 
thank you, Madam President, for having convened this 
important meeting of the General Assembly to discuss

Criminal  Tribunal  for  the  Former  Yugoslavia  (ICTY) 
(A/61/271). 

My delegation wishes to express its thanks to the 
ICTR  President,  Judge  Erik  Møse,  for  his  statement. 
We  wish  to  commend  the  Tribunal  Chambers,  the 
prosecution  and  the  Registry  for  their  continued  hard 
work 
successful 
implementation  of 
in 
accordance  with  Security  Council  resolution  1534 
(2004). 
The Government of Rwanda believes that, as the 

time  set  by  the  Security  Council  for  the  International 
Criminal  Tribunal  for  Rwanda  to  complete  its  work 
draws  closer,  it  becomes  more  imperative  than  ever 
that  its  work  be  conducted  with  the  highest  standards 
of integrity and veracity, as well as with efficiency. 

The  Government  of  Rwanda  has  in  the  past 
expressed the serious concern that the ICTR has on its 
staff, including on defence teams, individuals who are 
themselves  accused  of  having  committed  serious 
crimes during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. At the end 
of  September,  my  Government  brought  it  to  the 
attention  of 
that  15  such 
individuals  were  employed  by  the  ICTR. Ten  of  those 
suspects  have  since  resigned.  We  take  this  issue  very 
seriously  and 
the  expeditious 
resolution  of  this  issue  by  the  Tribunal,  including  by 
making  public 
independent 
investigation on 10 of these suspects and the arrest and 
prosecution of those suspects. 
Rwanda  believes  that  as  the  Tribunal  works 

towards  completing  its  work  in  the  next  two  years  in 
accordance with the completion strategy, there are four 
particular  areas  where  significant  progress  is  most 
urgent. 

The  first  concerns  fugitives  still  at  large.  The 
most serious  perpetrators of the genocide, its planners 
and authors should not be allowed to evade justice. The 
Tribunal’s completion strategy should not be seen as an 
exit  strategy  for  the  obligations  of  the  international 
community  to  bring  all  the  suspects  of  the  crime  of 
genocide to trial at the ICTR or in Rwanda. We would 
welcome  appropriate  measures  that  would  ensure  that 
all  the  accused  are  brought  to  justice,  even  after  the 
Tribunal’s  mandate  has  expired.  My  delegation  has 
repeatedly  expressed  Rwanda’s  commitment,  which  I 
repeat  here  today,  to  work  with  Governments  around 
the  world  to  bring  these  suspects  to  justice.  We  must 
the  Security  Council 
report  of

look 
the 
to 
the 

the 
send 
the  wrong 
signal  about 
the  Prosecution  and 
not  allow  notorious  suspects  such  as  Félicien  Kabuga 
and  Augustine  Ngirabatware  to  evade  justice.  If  they 
do,  it  would  be  an  extremely  sad  indictment  of  us  all 
and  would 
the 
commitment of the international community to prevent 
genocide  by  combating  impunity.  We  welcome  recent 
efforts  by 
international 
community to meet with Kenyan authorities to discuss 
the  matter. We  look  forward  to  the  arrest  and  transfer 
for trial of Mr. Kabuga in the near future. We also call 
upon all States to cooperate with the Tribunal to track, 
apprehend and transfer indictees still at large. 

The  second  area  of  concern  involves  transfer  of 
cases.  It  is  a  widely  accepted  principle  that  trials, 
especially  for  crimes  as  serious  as  genocide,  should 
take  place  as  close  as  possible  to  where  the  crimes 
were  committed.  We  welcomed  Prosecutor  Jallow’s 
reiteration to the Security Council in June that Rwanda 
continues  to  be  the  major  focus  for  referrals.  In  this 
connection,  it  is  our  view  that  the  trials  targeted  for 
transfer  should  take  place  in  Rwanda.  This  would 
contribute to our own efforts to eradicate the culture of 
impunity and promote reconciliation in Rwanda, as our 
people  would  be  first-hand  witnesses  to  justice  being 
done.  The  Rwanda  Government  is  working  with  the 
Tribunal,  particularly  the  prosecution,  to  prepare  for 
these  transfers,  including  by  addressing  several  legal 
and procedural issues. We are also addressing the issue 
of the death penalty. 

The Government of Rwanda has made significant 
progress,  despite  its  limited  means,  in  developing  the 
capacity of the judiciary. We appeal to the international 
community to support the preparations for the transfer 
of  trials  to  Rwanda  and  also  to  provide  financial 
support for the trials once they begin. 

The  third  area  requiring  significant  progress  is 
the  transfer  of  convicts. The  Rwanda  Government  has 
consistently stated that all ICTR convicts should serve 
sentences 
the  crimes  were 
committed. Once again, we believe that this is essential 
for  justice  and  reconciliation  processes  in  Rwanda, 
which  were  the  main  reasons  why  the  ICTR  was 
established in the first place. The initial concern about 
the administration of sentences in Rwanda was the lack 
of  a  detention 
international 
standards. However, a detention facility was built more 
than  two  years  ago  and  was  inspected  by  ICTR 
officials, who certified that it meets those international 
standards and signed a memorandum of understanding 
in  Rwanda,  where 
that  meets

the 
the  United  Nations  and 


to that effect. Despite this, there continues to be delay 
in effecting transfers. It is unclear to us why this is the 
case.  We,  therefore,  appeal  for  these  transfers  to  be 
carried out expeditiously. 

The final area requiring significant progress is the 
transfer  of  documents  and  materials.  As  we  consider 
the legacy of the Tribunal and its effect on Rwanda, we 
believe that the completion strategy should incorporate 
the  transfer  of  all  court  documents  and  materials  to 
Rwanda.  We  believe  that  as  the  ICTR  completes  its 
work, 
international 
community should establish a genocide prevention and 
educational centre to serve not only in memory of the 
Genocide’s  one  million  victims  but  also  to  serve  as  a 
centre  of  research  and  learning  about  lessons  learned 
from  the  genocide  in  Rwanda  and  as  a  centre  to 
promote justice, reconciliation and human rights. 

The  Rwanda  Government  is  open  to  discussions 
with  the  United  Nations  and  Member  States  on  how 
best to take this proposal forward. However, we should 
be  cognizant  of  the  need  to  act  quickly,  given  the 
limited  time  left  before  the  Tribunal  completes  its 
work. 

We  would  like  to  conclude  by  expressing  our 
profound  appreciation  to  the  international  community 
for  its  continued  support  of  the Tribunal  through  both 
assessed  and  voluntary  contributions. As  we  enter  the 
last leg, we urge you to continue your commitment to 
ensuring  that  the  Tribunal  is  adequately  resourced  to 
conduct  its  work  efficiently  and  effectively.  We  also 
thank  the  Tribunal  President  and  Prosecutor  and  their 
respective 
the 
implementation of the completion strategy. 
Ms. Skaare (Norway): Let me start by expressing 

Norway’s continued support and full recognition of the 
achievements 
the 
International  Criminal  Tribunals  for  Rwanda  and  the 
Former Yugoslavia, as reflected in the Tribunals’ well-
reasoned  judgements  and  in  the  annual  reports  before 
us in documents A/61/265 and A/61/271 respectively. 

We  would  like  to  thank  the  Presidents  of  the 
Tribunals,  Judges  Pocar  and  Møse  for  their  detailed 
and  informative  reports,  which  reflect  the  progress 
made during the period under review. 
The Tribunals have made a crucial contribution to

The  Rwanda  Tribunal  has  delivered 
well  as  other  international,  tribunals.  By  effectively 
prosecuting 
the  most  severe 
international  crimes,  the  Tribunals  have  not  only 
contributed  to  justice  for  victims  in  Rwanda  and  the 
former  Yugoslavia,  but  have  also  made  significant 
achievements  in  the  fight  against  impunity  for  mass 
atrocities in general. 

Norway is pleased to note that both Tribunals are 
fully  committed  to  meeting  the  completion  strategy 
targets approved by the Security Council. We commend 
the  measures  taken  to  increase  the  efficiency  of  the 
Tribunals,  and  we  encourage  continuing  this  positive 
development, while at the same time ensuring that due 
process and fundamental legal principles are realized. 

According  to  the  report  of  the  Rwanda Tribunal, 
the  revised  completion  strategy  that  was  submitted  to 
the Security Council on 29 May 2006 confirms that the 
Tribunal is on course to complete trials involving 65 to 
70 persons by 2008, depending on progress in present 
and future cases. 

three 
judgements  in  major  trials  during  the  review  period, 
bringing  the  total  to  22  judgements  involving  28 
accused  since  1997.  In  addition,  trials  involving  27 
accused  are  in  progress,  thus  bringing  the  number  of 
accused  whose  trials  have  been  completed  or  are  in 
progress  to  55.  The  Appeals  Chamber  delivered  an 
appeal judgement during the period under review. 
The Yugoslavia Tribunal has continued to operate 

at 
full  capacity.  Six 
running 
simultaneously, and three trials with multiple accused, 
involving 21 accused persons, commenced earlier than 
anticipated.  We  welcome  the  decision  by  the  Security 
Council  to  allow  the  Yugoslavia  Tribunal  ad  litem 
judges  to  serve  as  reserve  judges,  as  well  as  the 
decision  by  the  Council  and  the  General Assembly  to 
extend  the  term  of  office  for  the  permanent  judges  of 
the  Rwanda  Tribunal.  Furthermore,  we  support  the 
extension  of  the  terms  of  office  for  all  18  ad  litem 
judges of that Tribunal until the end of 2008. 

It is critical to the success of both Tribunals that 
all  States  are  committed  to  the  fulfilment  of  their 
mandates 
effective 
cooperation, in accordance with their legal obligations. 

We  appeal  to  all  States  to  demonstrate,  not  only 
in words, but also in practice, their fullest cooperation 
with  the  Tribunals. As  the  completion  of  the  work  of 
trials  have  been

the  Tribunals  approaches,  unreserved  support  on  the 
part of States is crucial. It is of the outmost importance 
that all States honour their financial commitments and 
pay their assessed contributions on time. Furthermore, 
Member  States  must  fulfil  their  obligations  to  arrest 
and  transfer  fugitives  to  the  Tribunals  without  delay. 
There  can  be  no  doubt  that  the  failure  to  arrest 
Radovan Karadic and Ratko Mladic, as well as Félicien 
Kabuga, who has been indicted by the ICTR, remains a 
serious  concern.  We  urge  the  involved  States  to 
cooperate fully with the Tribunals. It is not acceptable 
that  perpetrators  of  serious  international  crimes  are 
able  to  avoid  legal  proceedings.  The  main  mission  of 
the  Tribunals  can  not  be  fulfilled  unless  the  highest-
ranking indictees are brought to justice. 
Norway has an agreement regarding enforcement 

of  sentences  with 
the  Yugoslavia  Tribunal  and 
cooperates  closely  in  several  fields  with  the  Rwanda 
Tribunal.  The  process  is  in  urgent  need  of  States  that 
are  willing

enforcement  of  judgements.  It  is  unreasonable  that, 
today,  only  a  few  Member  States  shoulder

the Tribunals by their active and concrete action. 

Norway  will  stand  by  its  long-term  commitment 
to  the  successful  completion  of  the  missions  assigned 
to the two Tribunals by the Security Council. 

Mrs.  Mladineo  (Croatia):  Let  me  begin  by 
welcoming  the  President  of  the  International  Criminal 
the  former  Yugoslavia  (ICTY)  and 
Tribunal  for 
extending  our 
thanks 
the 
thirteenth annual report. 

While Croatia associates itself with the statement 
delivered earlier by Finland on behalf of the European 
Union (EU), I would like to offer a few further remarks 
on  the  ICTY.  The  report  is  factual  and  concise, 
testifying  to  the  Tribunal’s  determination  to  meet  its 
completion  strategy  targets.  We  are  pleased  to  note 
that, under the new President’s guidance, the process of

internal reform continued along the lines set out in the 
Tribunal’s 
thus 
significantly 
improving  procedural  efficiency.  The 
Office  of  the  Prosecutor,  on  the  other  hand,  opened  a 
new  chapter  by  referring  cases  to  national  courts  for 
the first time, two of them to Croatia. 

The Tribunal’s relevance in ending impunity and 
advancing the cause of justice remains undisputed. No 
less  important  is  its  role  in  helping  to  consolidate  a 
national judiciary in the region to deal with war crimes. 
Referral of cases under rule 11 bis, which Croatia has 
long  advocated,  testifies  to  the  advanced  level  of 
stability,  confidence,  commitment  and 
inter-State 
cooperation  in  the  administration  of  justice  in  war 
crimes prosecutions. 

However,  before  we  can  claim  that  a  full  circle 
has  been  completed  and  justice  properly  served,  it  is 
imperative  to  arrest,  surrender  and  try  the  remaining 
fugitives. This is the cornerstone of an exit strategy. 

Cooperation  remains  crucial  for  completing  the 
Tribunal’s  mandate.  The  Government  of  Croatia  has 
made it clear that it takes this responsibility seriously. 
With the arrest of the accused Ante Gotovina in Spain 
last year, the last remaining issue in relations with the 
Tribunal  has  been  resolved.  We  are  pleased  that  the 
scope and quality of our cooperation is reflected in the 
Prosecutor’s  assessment  of  Croatia’s  efficient  and 
professional cooperation. 

However,  our  commitment  does  not  stop  at  The 
Hague.  We  continue  to  believe  that  national  courts 
have  a  critical  role  to  play  in  de-politicizing  war 
crimes.  The  establishment  of 
individual  criminal 
responsibility,  on  all  levels  and  on  all  sides,  is  a 
prerequisite for stability, reconciliation and peace. This 
can be a challenge.  I am pleased to say  that a Special 
War Crimes Court in Croatia is engaged in a number of 
cases.  An  increasing  number  of  investigations  of 
crimes  have  been  opened.  The  level  of  inter-State 
cooperation 
these  matters  has  also  visibly 
intensified. 

Later this morning we will hear the report on the 
work of the International Criminal Court (ICC). Let me 
just say that we are proud that this common endeavour, 
the  ICC,  continues  to  consolidate  its  presence  in  the 
international order. It has been rightly observed that the 
Court  is  rapidly  becoming  the  centrepiece  of  the 
emerging  system  of 
justice.  Croatia

Mr.  Jevremović  (Serbia):  Allow  me  to  express 

my  appreciation  and  thanks  to  Judge  Fausto  Pocar, 
President of the International Criminal Tribunal for the 
Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), for his presentation of the 
ICTY’s  annual  report  (A/61/271) 
the  General 
Assembly. 

The  Government  of  Serbia  has  expressed  its  full 
determination  and  definite  political  commitment  that 
all individuals indicted  for the most serious violations 
of international law during the conflicts in the territory 
of the former Yugoslavia should be brought to justice, 
either 
the 
domestic 
legal  or 
political, that is first and foremost a moral necessity. In 
that sense, we hope in particular that cooperation with 
the  Tribunal  will  bring  that  process  to  a  successful 
conclusion. 

the 
Government  of  the  Republic  of  Serbia  has  made 
considerable  efforts  to  apprehend  and  transfer  to  The 
Hague  16  indicted  persons.  However,  some  of  them 
voluntarily  surrendered  themselves  to  the  custody  of 
the Tribunal.  Most of those indictees are former high-
ranking  military  and  police  officers.  We  consider  that 
that  process  was  carried  out  in  partnership  with  the 
ICTY, which ensured the best results. The Government 
of  Serbia  is  fully  committed  to  continue  in  the  same 
direction,  and  to  fulfil  its  remaining  international 
obligations in that respect. 

In  July  of  this  year,  the  Government  of  the 
Republic  of  Serbia  adopted  an  action  plan  for 
cooperation  with  the  ICTY  that  will  further  facilitate 
that process. In the two months that the plan has been 
implemented,  appropriate 
institutional  mechanisms 
have  been  launched  for  the  sole  purpose  of  locating, 
arresting  and  transferring  the  indictee  Ratko  Mladic 
and  other  remaining  fugitives. Apart  from  an  obvious 
political  dimension,  the  whole  process  is  simply  a 
matter of implementing law.  
The Government of the Republic of Serbia has on 

many occasions stated that it is in the interest of Serbia 
the  end  of  2004  and 
Between 
today, 
A/61/PV.26
to bring its cooperation with the ICTY to a successful 
conclusion  as  soon  as  possible.  As  far  as  the  case  of 
indictee Ratko Mladic is concerned, the Government of 
Serbia has stated that the hiding of Ratko Mladic is an 
act of dishonesty that challenges the administration of 
justice  and  directly  threatens  the  national  and  State 
interests  of  Serbia.  I  would  in  particular  like  to 
emphasize  that  the  Government  of  Serbia  has  done 
everything  in  its  power  to  locate  Ratko  Mladic  and 
transfer him to The Hague. No doubt, there is political 
will  and  determination  to  establish  his  whereabouts. 
This matter is therefore one of a technical nature. The 
individuals  who  have  helped  fugitive  Mladic  to  evade 
arrest  are  currently  under  investigation  or  awaiting 
trials.  In  total,  11  suspects  have  been  brought  before 
courts  and  been  sentenced  as  Mladic’s  accomplices. 
Despite  those  efforts,  it  has  not  yet  been  possible  to 
locate  Ratko  Mladic.  We  remain  determined  to  close 
this case, well aware of the moral and political damage 
to which Serbia is exposed. 
I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  bring  to 

the  Assembly’s  attention  our  readiness 
to  fully 
cooperate  with  the  ICTY  Prosecutor’s  Office  vis-à-vis 
access to State archives and documents. 

The  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Serbia  has 
thus far granted waivers to testify as witnesses to more 
than 500 persons who are former members of the army, 
police  or  Government  services.  Serbia  is  providing 
effective  assistance  to  the  Office  of  the  Prosecutor  in 
locating, 
testimony  from 
witnesses  as  well  as  suspects.  We  have  thus  far 
provided the Office of the Prosecutor several thousand 
documents,  including  classified  documents  from  the 
Supreme  Defence  Council, 
the 
Counter-intelligence  Service  and  the  Ministry  of  the 
Interior,  among  others.  Furthermore,  the  National 
Council  for  Cooperation  with  the  ICTY  has  granted 
general access to the State archives to investigators of 
the  Office  of  the  Prosecutor.  The  exchange  of  visits 
between  top  Belgrade  and  Hague  officials  has  also 
become a regular practice. 

The  Republic  of  Serbia  welcomes  the  Tribunal’s 
efforts  to  expedite  its  work  in  order  to  meet  the 
deadlines  and  conditions  set  out  in  Security  Council 
resolutions  1503  (2003)  and  1534  (2004).  In  that 
regard, the Republic of Serbia considers tracking down 
remaining  indictees  and  bringing  them  to  trial  in  the 
national jurisdiction to be a complementary process of 
crucial  importance.  Trials  before  the  domestic  courts

A/61/PV.26 

will  contribute  to  the  goals  for  which  the  ICTY  was 
established, in 1993, as a high-level body of the United 
Nations.  

It  is  for  that  reason  that  the  Republic  of  Serbia 
reiterates its readiness to have its judicial authorities —
including  the  Special  Prosecutor’s  Office  for  War 
Crimes  and  the  Department  for  War  Crimes  of  the 
Belgrade  District  Court  — 
indicted 
individuals, 
that  may  be 
transferred  from  The  Hague.  However,  despite  the 
positive  assessment  of  judicial  proceedings  by  our 
domestic  courts  given  by  the Tribunal  itself  and  some 
States,  including  permanent  members  of  the  Security 
Council, not a single case has thus far been transferred. 
Let  me  emphasize  again  that  we  firmly  believe  that 
mutual  cooperation  and  trust  will  contribute  to  the 
effective administration of justice. 

The  new  penal  code  of  the  Republic  of  Serbia, 
which was adopted in September 2005, more precisely 
set  out  command  responsibility  for  serious  violations 
of  humanitarian 
law  during  armed  conflict.  Just 
recently, the law on witness protection was adopted as 
well. That legislation will further lay a firm foundation 
for processing war crimes. 

Serbia  welcomes  the  agreement  between  the 
Organization  for  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe 
(OSCE)  and  the  ICTY  that  allows  existing  OSCE 
missions  to  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina,  Croatia,  Serbia 
and  Montenegro  to  monitor  the  war  crimes  trials  that 
have been transferred, or  will be transferred,  from the 
ICTY to the judiciaries of respective countries. 

Prosecutors  from  Serbia,  Montenegro,  Croatia 
and Bosnia and Herzegovina have met several times in 
Belgrade  and  elsewhere  to  discuss  further  cooperation 
regarding  the  prosecution  of  war  crimes.  Relevant 
memorandums of understanding have also been signed. 

We are grateful to the OSCE, the United Nations 
Development  Programme,  the  Council  of  Europe  and 
various  countries  for  assisting  Serbia  in  amending  its 
criminal legislation to accord with ICTY standards and 
for  training  prosecutors  and  judges  to  deal  with  war 
crimes. We look forward to further cooperation in that 
field. 

Finally, I would like to reiterate the firm position 
of  the  Government  of  Serbia  that  it  will  continue  to 
take  all  steps  within  its  power  in  order  to  locate  the 
remaining  indicted  persons  and,  if  they  are  hiding  in 
those  victims  of 
Serbia, to transfer them to The Hague. The Republic of 
Serbia  is  resolved  that  all  those  who  committed  war 
crimes  should  stand  trial,  either  by  the  ICTY  or  by 
domestic  courts.  The  Government  of  Serbia  shall 
continue  to  take  all  possible  steps  to  fully  honour  its 
international  commitments  and  bring  its  cooperation 
with  the  ICTY  to  a  successful  conclusion. We  believe 
that the  results achieved thus far are the best proof of 
that. 
Mr.  Chokhal  (Nepal):  My  delegation  thanks  the 

Secretary-General  for  transmitting  the  reports  on  the 
activities of the two Tribunals during the past year. We 
would like to thank the Presidents of both the Tribunals 
for their presentations this morning. 

Peace,  justice  and  the  rule  of  law  are  principal 
goals  for  humanity.  The  Security  Council  established 
the  International  Criminal  Tribunal  for  the  Former 
Yugoslavia  (ICTY)  and  the  International  Criminal 
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) to bring peace and justice 
to 
indiscriminate  murder  and 
extermination,  which  were  crimes  against  humanity. 
My delegation is confident that both the Tribunals will 
redouble  their  efforts  to  increase  the  efficiency  and 
efficacy  of  their  proceedings  in  their  Trial  Chambers 
and the Appeals Chamber. 

We have noted that in recent years both Tribunals 
have  attached  priority  to  the  implementation  of  the 
completion  strategy  as  endorsed  by 
the  Security 
Council  in  its  resolution  1503  (2003).  A  number  of 
measures  for  developing  the  judicial  capacity  of 
national  authorities  in  the  former  Yugoslavia  and 
strengthening  the  ICTY’s  outreach  activities  will  play 
an  important  role  in  this  regard.  We  note  that  the 
Tribunals  have  undertaken 
internal  and  external 
reforms,  action  on  diplomatic  relations  and  other 
representation,  submission  of  the  ICTY’s  fifth  report 
on  the  implementation  of  its  completion  strategy 
(S/2006/353)  and  judicial  activity  such  as  assigning 
cases  to  Chambers  in  a  timely  manner  and  the 
appointment of pre-appeal judges. 

All the Tribunal organs, including their Registries 
and  Prosecutors’  Offices,  should  work  together  with  a 
view  to  completing  the  mandates  of  the  Tribunals 
effectively  and  efficiently.  We  consider 
the 
assistance  of  Member  States  concerned  can  play  a 
crucial  role  in  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the 
Tribunals.  The  Tribunals  should  scrutinize 
their 
practices  and  procedures  in  search  of  ways  to  ensure 
that 
14 

06-55951 
a  high-powered 
reconciliation  and  peacebuilding 


that they fulfil their mandates in the time frame of their 
completion strategies. 

Nepal believes strongly in the principle that there 
must  be  no  impunity  for  the  most  serious  crimes  of 
concern to the international community. Both the ICTR 
and  the  ICTY  were  established  to  hold  individuals 
accountable for such crimes. Peace, justice and the rule 
of  law  are  inextricably  linked.  We  also  believe  that 
both Tribunals are making very important contributions 
towards 
the 
countries they are serving. 

Let  me  share  how  Nepal  has  also  dealt  with  the 
principle of no impunity at the national level. Nepal is 
now a multiparty democratic country strictly following 
the principles of justice, the rule of law, human rights 
and  fundamental  freedoms.  Following  the  successful 
people’s  movement  last  April,  the  Government  of 
Nepal 
independent 
commission,  under  the  chairmanship  of  a  former 
Supreme  Court  justice,  to  carry  out  an  investigation 
into  violations  of  human  rights  and  fundamental 
freedoms  and  the  atrocities  committed  against  the 
peaceful  democratic  movement  in  our  country.  The 
commission is currently working to fulfil its mandates 
to  make 
necessary 
prosecution  and  punishments,  bringing  to  justice  the 
perpetrators of crimes aimed at the suppression of the 
peaceful people’s movement. The Government is fully 
committed 
the 
recommendations  of  the  commission.  We  believe  that 
transitional  justice  for  victims  of  crimes  committed 
against  civilians  should  be  rendered  with  a  view  to 
ensuring  lasting  peace,  stability  and  reconciliation  in 
the country. 

My  delegation  considers  that  principle  of  no 
impunity should be strictly respected  and observed  by 
all,  and  under  all  circumstances.  The  rule  of  law  and 
justice  should  form  the  foundation  of  a  democratic 
society.  The  United  Nations  should  encourage  and 
promote these principles in its work, as envisaged in its 
Charter. 
Mr.  Prasad  (India):  First  of  all,  I  would  like  to 

thank the Presidents of both Tribunals for their reports 
to the General Assembly. 

International criminal law has assumed increased 
prominence  with  the  creation  of  the  International 
Criminal  Tribunal  for  the  Former  Yugoslavia  (ICTY) 
and,  later,  the  International  Criminal  Tribunal  for 
taking  necessary  action  on 
recommendations 
for 
the 
established 
to 
in 
A/61/PV.26
Rwanda  (ICTR).  These  were  the  first  international 
criminal tribunals established since the Nuremberg and 
Tokyo  tribunals  of  the  Second World War.  Because  of 
the  manner  of  their  creation,  they  have  faced  a  great 
number of political and legal challenges in establishing 
their  legitimacy.  In  questioning  the  competence  of  the 
Security  Council  to  establish  these  Tribunals,  many 
legal  scholars,  after  an  extensive  analysis  of  the 
traveaux  préparatoires,  came  to  the  conclusion  that  it 
was  not  the  intention  of  the  drafters  of  the  Charter  to 
endow  the  Council  with  such  competence.  However, 
some  scholars  rely  on  other  concepts  to  justify  the 
attribution  of  legislative  functions  to  the  Council, 
namely the concepts of implied powers and subsequent 
practice. 
The  concept  of  implied  powers  is  derived  from 

the  idea  that  organizations  or  their  organs  must  have 
the  power  and  competence  that  are  necessary  or 
essential  for  the  execution  of  their  functions.  In  the 
1949  advisory  opinion  on  reparation  for  injuries 
suffered in the service of the United Nations case, the 
International Court of Justice found that 

“Under  international  law,  the  Organization  must 
be  deemed  to  have  those  powers  which,  though 
not  expressly  provided 
the  Charter,  are 
conferred  upon  it  by  necessary  implication  as 
being essential to the performance of its duties.” 

That doctrine and Article 29 of the Charter, under 
which  the  Security  Council  can  establish  subsidiary 
organs necessary for its functions, is often used in the 
context  of  justifying  the  setting  up  of  the  ICTY.  That 
doctrine  has  also  been  confirmed  by  the  ICTY  in  the 
Tadíc  case.  However,  this  ignores  the  basic  legal 
principle  nemo  dat  quod  non  habet,  meaning  that  one 
cannot  give  what  one  does  not  have.  The  Security 
Council  has  not  been  assigned  any  judicial  functions 
under the Charter; therefore, under Article 29, or under 
the  concept  of  implied  powers,  it  cannot  set  up  a 
subsidiary  body,  entrusting  to  it  functions  which  the 
Council itself does not possess. In so doing the Council 
did  not  take  a  legitimate  peace-enforcement  measure 
under  any  article  or  articles  of  Chapter  VII,  notably 
under Article 41. It took, simply, a lawmaking — not to 
mention 
law-enforcing  — 
measure which fell outside its functions under Chapter 
VII  or  any  other  provision  of  the  Charter  or  general 
international law.

International humanitarian law requires that trials 
for violations must be scrupulously fair and consistent 
with  contemporary  international  standards.  Therefore, 
the Tribunals, in bringing to justice those who bear the 
greatest 
serious  violations  of 
international law, must ensure that they provide for the 
highest standards of fair trial. 

The  purpose  of  prosecution  is  to  accomplish  at 
least  two  goals.  The  first  is  to  punish  the  guilty.  The 
second  is  to  promote  a  range  of  socially  desirable 
results, including the deterrence of future offences and 
the fostering of an overall respect for the rule of law. In 
instances  where  the  cases  grow  out  of  profound 
national  traumas,  such  as  civil  war  or  a  period  of 
the 
repression, 
promotion 
political 
reconciliation,  and  the  fostering  of  national  catharsis 
are  also 
to  be  critical  goals.  Although 
international prosecutions can perhaps achieve the first 
goal  —  punishing  the  guilty —  they  are  often  not 
equipped to deliver on the others. There is a view that 
when such international prosecutions are undertaken by 
foreign  judicial  systems  or  tribunals  with  little  or  no 
connection  to  the  perpetrators,  victims,  or  offences, 
they are invariably uncoupled from the political, social 
and economic context of the affected country. 

Further,  given  the  challenges  associated  with 
investigating  and  prosecuting  international  crimes,  the

all 
perpetrators. Therefore, strengthening national judicial 
systems 
is  extremely 
essential.  Creating  effective  and  lasting  legal  and 
judicial  institutions  that  uphold  the  rule  of  law  is 
necessary for the maintenance of peace. Therefore, the 
international  community  must  continue  to  strengthen 
national justice systems by building the local capacity 
of judicial personnel. That includes the further training 
and  mentoring  of  the  local  judiciary,  as  well  as  a 
timetable  to  gradually  introduce  local  judges  and 
prosecutors into sensitive cases. 

According  to  the  reports  of  the  Tribunals,  the 
ICTY  has  developed  a  cooperative  relationship  with 
neighbouring  States  and  regional  institutions,  and  the 
ICTR, through its Outreach Programme, has worked on 
capacity-building  by 
jurists, 
advocates  and  human  rights  practitioners  through 
seminars  and  workshops  aimed  at  strengthening 
knowledge  of 
law  and 
criminal  law.  Those  are  commendable  efforts.  In  that

regard,  the  establishment  of  the War  Crimes  Chamber 
of the State Court of Bosnia and the transfer of cases to 
that  Chamber  by  the  Yugoslav  Tribunal  are  further 
steps  in  the  right  direction,  although  the  ICTY  should 
have been set up by the General Assembly. 

We  hope  that  both  the  Tribunals  will  be  able  to 
complete  their  work  within  the  time  frames  stipulated 
by the relevant Security Council resolutions. 
Mr.  Shinyo  (Japan):  I  would  like  to  thank  the 

Presidents  of  the  two Tribunals,  Judge  Erik  Møse  and 
Judge Fausto Pocar, for presenting their annual reports 
to the General Assembly. 

Japan  understands  that  both Tribunals  have  been 
continuing their efforts to ensure the completion of all 
trials by the end of 2010. We reiterate our position that 
both the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former 
Yugoslavia  (ICTY)  and  the  International  Criminal 
Tribunal  for  Rwanda  (ICTR)  should  be  strongly 
encouraged  to  achieve  their  completion  strategies  by 
exploring all necessary and appropriate measures. 

We  consider  the  termination  of  the  Milosevic 
trial,  due  to  the  death  of  the  accused  in  detention  in 
March  this  year,  to  have  been  an  unfortunate  event, 
because  his  death  has  made  it  more  difficult  for  the 
truth  to  be  established  regarding  the  conflict  in  the 
former  Yugoslavia  and 
individually 
committed by the accused. Japan continues to hope that 
the  ICTY  will  fulfil  the  purpose  of  its  establishment: 
bringing 
those  responsible  for  serious 
violations of international humanitarian law. 

From  that  point  of  view,  it  is  an  urgent  task  to 
bring about the arrest and extradition of the remaining 
key fugitives, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. We 
strongly urge all neighbouring States, including Serbia, 
to  make  their  utmost  efforts  to  that  end.  Japan  also 
remains concerned that the arrest and extradition to the 
ICTR of Félicien Kabuga have yet to be accomplished. 

We note with appreciation that the multi-accused 
trials in the ICTY commenced earlier than planned. We 
are very interested in the further development of those 
trials.  With  regard  to  the  request  by  the  Secretary-
General for the extension of the terms of office of the 
18  ad  litem  judges  of  the  ICTR,  we  are  ready  to 
support such action in order to facilitate the fulfilment 
of the completion strategy. 
Given  the  deadline  provided  in  the  completion 

strategies,  the  time  has  come  for  us  to  focus  our

activities  on  capacity-building  and  outreach  activities 
at  the  regional,  national  and  community  levels.  We 
believe that the establishment of the rule of law in the 
States  and  regions  concerned  is  vital  for  real  justice 
and confidence in the reconciliation process. With that 
in mind, Japan, in cooperation with the United Nations 
Development  Programme,  has  been  conducting  a 
project  to  assist  the  War  Crimes  Chamber  in  Bosnia 
and Herzegovina by training judicial staff members and 
providing  needed  equipment.  The  training  for  the 
judges  was  recently  carried  out,  and  the  training 
session  for  the  prosecutors  will  be  held  beginning  on 
10  October,  including  training  in  the  use  of  ICTY 
evidence in the War Crimes Chamber and access to the 
ICTY’s  resources  and  database.  That  project  also 
includes  awareness-raising  programmes  to  help  local 
people  understand  that  those  responsible  for  the  war 
crimes are being brought to justice. 

Given the prospects that Tribunals will complete 
the  first  round  of  trials  by  the  end  of  2008,  it  is  now 
time  to  give  further  consideration  to  the  precise 
scheduling  of  appeal  cases,  although  we  understand 
that  there  are  a  number  of  unpredictable  factors 
involved. Japan requests that the regular reports of the 
Tribunals 
the 
General Assembly also address that task. 

the 
international community over the past 10 years will be 
fully reflected in and integrated into regional, national 
and community capacities. 
Mr.  Rogachev  (Russian  Federation)  (spoke  in 

Russian):  We  wish  to  thank  the  leadership  of  both 
Tribunals for their annual reports on the work of their 
courts  and  for 
the  General 
Assembly. 

We  take  note  of  the  progress  made  by  the 
International  Criminal  Court  for  Rwanda  (ICTR)  over 
the  past  year.  We  welcome  its  ongoing  efforts  to 
implement  the  completion  strategy,  as  called  for  in 
decisions  of  the  Security  Council.  During  the  period 
under  review,  the  President  of  the  ICTR  promptly 
informed  the  Secretary-General  about  the  problems 
that had arisen in the work of the Tribunal with regard 
to  the  expiry  of  judges’  mandates.  We  are  pleased  to 
note 
the 
General Assembly  swiftly  addressed  the  matter  and 
took appropriate and legally correct decisions based on 
the items contained in the ICTR’s completion strategy.

Mr.  Chidyausiku  (Zimbabwe),  Vice-President, 

took the Chair.

Unfortunately, however, we are unable to provide 
a  similar  assessment  with  regard  to  the  work  of  the 
International  Tribunal  for  the  Prosecution  of  Persons 
Responsible  for  Serious  Violations  of  International 
Humanitarian  Law  Committed  in  the  Territory  of  the 
Former  Yugoslavia 
(ICTY).  That 
politicized, non-transparent and costly body often finds 
itself under unremitting criticism from various parties. 
This  year,  the  reputation  of  the  ICTY  generally 
declined  following  the  deaths  of  the  main  indictee, 
Mr. Milosevic,  and  of  another  indictee,  Mr.  Babic,  in 
the Scheveningen prison. 

We note unacceptable bias in judges’ decisions. It 
is  unfortunate  that  the  report  does  not  contain  a 
comparative  table  of  the  number  of  those  convicted 
broken  down  by  nationality  and  the  length  of  prison 
sentences  handed  down 
indictees  of  different 
nationalities for crimes of similar nature and gravity. 

We  expect  the  Tribunal  to  abide  strictly  by  the 
completion  strategy  in  accordance  with  the  deadlines 
set  by  the  Security  Council.  In  that  regard,  we  would 
like  to  note  that  the  leadership  of  the  Tribunal  has 
recently  undertaken  some  administrative  steps  to  that 
end.  However,  we  shall  deem  satisfactory  only  those 
decisions  and  actions  by  the  ICTY’s  leadership  that 
adhere  to  the  strategy.  The  ICTY’s  failure  to  produce 
Mr. Mladic, Mr. Karadzic and other indictees cannot be 
viewed  as  justification  for  the  unlimited  extension  of 
the Tribunal’s work. 

the 
We  welcome 
capacities  of  national  criminal  justice  bodies,  which 
would  seamlessly  receive  litigation  materials  against 
individuals who fall under the jurisdiction of the ICTY 
and the ICTR. 

In  our  view,  it  is  time  to  begin  to  look  into 
organizational matters related to the completion of the 
Tribunals’ work: the retention of archives, pensions for 
judges  and  so  on.  We  would  expect  chapters  on  such 
matters  to  be  included  in  subsequent  reports  of  both 
Tribunals.

deliberations  of  the  General Assembly. Allow  me  also 
to express our gratitude to both Judge Erik Møse of the 
International  Criminal  Tribunal  for  Rwanda  (ICTR) 
and  Judge  Fausto  Pocar  of  the  International  Criminal 
Tribunal  for  the  Former  Yugoslavia  (ICTY)  for  their 
comprehensive  reports  this  morning  on  the  work  of 
their respective Tribunals. 

I  should  just  like  to  make  a  few  comments  with 
regard  to  the  report  on  the  ICTR  (see A/61/265).  The 
ICTR  has  made 
the 
implementation  of 
strategy.  We 
recognize that the success of the court in completing its 
work by the envisaged date of 2008 hinges heavily on 
the  full  cooperation  of  Member  States.  In 
that 
connection,  we  applaud  the  recent  decision  by  the 
Security  Council,  in  its  resolution  1684  (2006),  to 
extend  the  terms  of  office  of  the  permanent  judges  to 
the  end  of  2008.  We  urge  Member  States  to  consider 
positively  the  subsequent  requests  by  the  Tribunal  to 
accord  similar  extensions  to  the  terms  of  office  of  ad 
litem judges. 

It  is  a  matter  of  great  concern  to  my  delegation 
that  a  large  number  of  indictees  —  18  in  total  —  are 
still at large. While, as pointed out by the President of 
the Tribunal, it is unlikely that the court will be able to 
bring all 18 indictees to trial by 2008, that should not 
slacken  our  efforts  to  pursue  and  arrest  indictees  who 
are still at large and to transfer to the Tribunal for the 
necessary attention. 

For  its  part,  the  Government  of  Kenya  has  been 
steadfast  in  its  cooperation  with  the  ICTR  since  its 
establishment. During and  after the Rwanda genocide, 
many  Rwandan  nationals  fled  into  Kenya  as  refugees. 
It  later  transpired  that  some  of  those  refugees  had 
participated  in  the  genocide  and  had  been  indicted  by 
the  ICTR.  Kenya  has  worked  very  closely  with  the 
Tribunal since its establishment. Indictees found to be 
in  Kenya  have  been  arrested  and  promptly  transferred 
to the court at Arusha. 

However,  there  have  been  allegations  —  and  I 
repeat  that  they  are  allegations  —  that  the  infamous 
indictee Félicien Kabuga, who is still at large, has been 
sighted  somewhere  in  Kenya.  The  Government  of 
Kenya has taken those allegations very seriously, and is

Report of the International Criminal Court 

  Note by the Secretary-General (A/61/217) 
The Acting President: I now call on Mr. Philippe 


Kirsch, President of the International Criminal Court. 

Mr.  Kirsch:  I  am  pleased  to  present  the  second 
annual report (A/61/217) of the International Criminal 
Court  (ICC)  to  the  United  Nations.  In  my  remarks,  I 
would like to speak about, first, where the Court stands 
today in its activities, and, secondly, the Court’s place 
within  the  emerging  system  of  international  justice.  I 
will start with the Court today. 
Since the report of the Court was submitted, two 

additional  States  have 
the  Rome  Statute. 
Comoros  ratified  the  Statute  on  18  August  and  Saint 
Kitts  and  Nevis  acceded  to  the  Statute  on  22 August. 
One  hundred  and  two  States  have  now  ratified  or 
acceded to the Rome Statute. 

This  year  marked  three  years  of  the  Court’s 
operation.  The  terms  of  six  of  the  first  judges  of  the 
Court came to an end. In January, the States parties to 
the  Rome  Statute,  meeting  here  in  New York,  elected 
six judges. As we enter the next triennium, the Court is 
moving towards its first trials.

Four  situations  have  been  referred  to  the  Court. 
The Prosecutor is conducting investigations in three of 
those  situations:  northern  Uganda,  the  Democratic 
Republic  of  the  Congo  and  Darfur,  the  Sudan.  Those 
investigations are taking place within the framework of 
a  prosecutorial  strategy,  a  new  version  of  which  was 
adopted by the Office of the Prosecutor this year in the 
light  of  the  Office’s  experience.  The  Office  of  the 
Prosecutor  has  the  exclusive  responsibility  to  receive 
and analyse referrals, as well as communications from 
other sources.

authorizing  an 
However,  the  Prosecutor  acts  independently  as  a 
separate organ of the Court in evaluating the available 
information  and  deciding  whether 
to  open  an 
investigation on his own accord or to request an arrest 
warrant.  As  such,  the  prosecutorial  strategy,  while 
harmonized with the Court’s strategic plan, reflects the 
independence of the Office of the Prosecutor. 

The  first  warrants  of  arrest  were  issued  by  the 
Court in 2005 in the situation in northern Uganda. The 
Office  of  the  Prosecutor  very  recently  indicated  that 
DNA tests have confirmed that one of the five persons 
subject  to  the  warrants  is  deceased.  The  other  four 
warrants remain outstanding. Judicial proceedings have 
continued before the Pre-Trial Chamber on issues such 
as monitoring the status of execution of arrest warrants 
and the unsealing of confidential documents. 

In the situation in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, Mr. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo was surrendered to 
the Court in March 2006, pursuant to an arrest warrant 
issued  in  February.  Since  Mr.  Lubanga’s  surrender, 
proceedings  have  been  conducted  before  the  Pre-Trial 
Chamber  on  a  wide  range  of  issues,  including  the 
disclosure of evidence to the defence, the participation 
of  victims  in  the  proceedings  and  the  protection  of 
victims  and  witnesses.  The  Pre-Trial  Chamber  is 
addressing  complex  legal  provisions  of  the  Rome 
Statute  that  are  being  interpreted  in  practice  for  the 
first time. 

One  of  the  significant  areas  of  activity  has  been 
balancing the disclosure of evidence necessary for the 
defence  to  prepare  its  case  with  the  need  to  redact 
information to protect victims and witnesses. Over 400

documents  and  more  than  5,000  pages  of  information 
have  been  disclosed  or  made  available  for  inspection 
by the Prosecutor to the defence. Each page had to be 
reviewed for redactions necessary, again, to protect the 
security of witnesses and victims. 

Before the case can proceed to trial, the Pre-Trial 
Chamber  must  confirm  the  charges. An  initial  hearing 
to  confirm  the  charges  was  postponed  in  order  to 
ensure  that  measures  were  in  place  to  protect  the 
security  of  witnesses.  The  hearing  was  subsequently 
postponed  a  second  time  out  of  concern  for  the  rights 
of  the  accused  and  the  need  for  the  defence  to  be 
adequately  prepared  for  the  hearing  which  is  now  set 
for 9 November 2006.

proceedings. But proceedings must also ensure the full 
protection  of  the  rights  of  the  accused  and  meet  the 
Court’s  obligations  to  protect  victims  and  witnesses. 
This  concern  is  linked  to  the  situation  of  the  Court  in 
the field, to which I shall return shortly. 

first  pretrial  proceedings  have  been 
conducted  in  the  situation  in  Darfur,  the  Sudan.  They 
have  again  dealt  with  issues  such  as  the  security  of 
victims  and  witnesses.  In  addition,  the  Prosecutor  has 
briefed the Security Council that local conditions have 
made it impossible to investigate in Darfur. Instead, the 
investigation is taking place in other countries. 

In  2006,  the  Appeals  Chamber  addressed  issues 
such as the scope of appellate review and decisions on 
jurisdiction  and  admissibility.  The  rulings  of  the 
Appeals Chamber constitute the final interpretations of 
provisions  of  the  Rome  Statute  on  issues  that  have 
been  subject 
the  Pre-Trial 
Chambers and should result in accelerated proceedings 
in the future. 

In  the  last  year,  the  Prosecutor  announced  that 
two  situations  which  had  been  analysed  had  been 
dismissed.  The  Prosecutor  is  analysing  five  other 
situations  for  jurisdiction  and  admissibility.  Two  of 
these situations have been made public — the situation 
in the Central African Republic, referred by that State 
party to the Court and the situation in Côte d’Ivoire, a 
non-State  party  which  has  accepted  the  jurisdiction  of 
the Court.

the  Court’s  activities  over  the  past  year  was  in  the

in 
circumstances  of  ongoing  conflict  or  other  potentially 
volatile situations. The extent of the challenges facing 
the  ICC  from  that  perspective  is  unlike  anything 
experienced by other courts or tribunals. Our activities 
must  be  carried  out  in  such  a  way  as  to  ensure  the 
safety of staff, victims, witnesses and others at risk. At 
times,  this  focus  on  safety  has  caused  delays  in  Court 
activity.  Missions  to  the  field  have  been  cancelled  at 
the last moment due to rapidly changing events on the 
ground.  Earlier  this  year,  rising  violence  forced  the 
temporary  closure  of  the  Court’s  field  office  in  Chad, 
which is operated in connection with the investigation 
into  Darfur,  the  Sudan.  The  Office  has  since  been 
reopened.  Operating  in  the  midst  of  ongoing  conflicts 
also  requires  additional  precautions  such  as  arranging 
standby medical evacuation capacity. 

The  Court  maintains  substantial  fixed  presences 
in  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo,  Uganda  and 
Chad.  These  offices  assist  the  Court  in  carrying  out 
functions 
such  as  witness  protection,  victims’ 
participation  and  reparations,  and  support  to  defence 
counsel. 

One  of  the  most  important  of  the  Court’s  field 
activities  is  outreach  to  local  populations. An  integral 
part of justice is that it is seen to be done. The ICC, its 
role  and  its  activities  must  be  understood.  This  is 
important  not  only  for  its  own  sake,  but  also  for 
facilitating necessary cooperation. The Court continued 
to  build  on  its  outreach  efforts  in  the  situations  in 
northern  Uganda  and  the  Democratic  Republic  of  the 
Congo. Outreach teams are in place in both countries, 
and  staff  from  The  Hague  also  travel  to  the  field  on 
outreach missions. The Court’s outreach included both 
general  awareness-building  and  programmes  targeted 
specifically  to  certain  groups  such  as  victims,  counsel 
or  the  media.  The  situation  in  Darfur  has  made 
outreach  more  difficult,  as  the  Court  is  not  able  to 
operate within the territory. 
Outreach  is  a  necessary  tool  to  ensure  that 

judicial  proceedings  are  understood  locally.  This  can 
also  be  accomplished  by  other  means,  notably  by 
holding  proceedings  where  crimes  were  committed. 
The  Rome  Statute  allows  the  Court  to  sit  outside The 
Hague.  In  the  course  of  the  general  debate  within  the 
General Assembly in this last year, States expressed the 
wish  that  the  Court  carry  out,  in  due  course,  some 
proceedings  in  the  field.  The  decision  to  do  so  will 
have to be taken by the judges in accordance with the

I would now like to talk about Court’s role in the 
Statute  and  Rules  of  Procedure  and  Evidence.  But  the 
Court is preparing for future proceedings to be held in 
the field, subject to acceptable conditions, in particular, 
security.  An  estimate  of  the  resources  needed  to 
conduct  hearings  in  the  field  has  been  included  in  the 
2007 budget. In the longer term, having an appropriate 
geographical  distribution  of  activities  is  one  of  the

emerging system of international justice. 

last  few  years  has 
reinforced the importance of cooperation for the ICC. I 
have already said that five arrest warrants delivered by 
the  Court  are  still  to  be  executed. The  Court  does  not 
have 
those 
individuals.  That  responsibility  is  incumbent  upon 
States  and  other  actors.  Such  support  is  obviously 
essential. Without arrests, there can be no trials.  

States  can  provide  support  to  the  Court  in  a 
number  of  ways. They  can  provide  evidence  that  they 
have  in  their  possession  or  allow  the  Court  easier 
access  to  other  evidence.  The  Court’s  ability  to 
investigate  and  conduct  trials  will  depend  on  the 
quantity and quality of the information that it receives. 
States can also assist the Court in holding hearings on 
individuals,  search  and  seizure,  identification  or  the 
locating of assets. 

Furthermore,  a  number  of  States  have  signed 
agreements relating to the reintegration of witnesses. It 
is  essential  that  we  establish  an  extensive  network  of 
such agreements so as to ensure that witnesses are able 
to testify without fear of reprisal, bearing in mind their 
physical 
the 
resettlement of such witnesses is to be successful, they 
must have the opportunity to reintegrate. That is why it 
is  particularly  useful  to  conclude  agreements  with 
States  making 
to  adapt 
culturally. 

The  Rome  Statute  also  provides  for  persons 
convicted  by  the  Court  to  serve  their  sentences  in  the

bilateral  agreement  with  the  ICC  providing  a  general 
framework for serving sentences.

France  facilitated  the  transfer  of  Mr.  Labanga  by 
making an aircraft available to the Court. 

In  addition  to  States,  international  and  regional 
organizations  are  making  an  important  contribution  to 
the  work  of  the  Court.  The  support  of  the  United 
Nations  has  been  essential  in  enabling  the  Court  to 
carry  out  its  activities,  in  particular  in  the  field.  The 
United  Nations  peacekeeping  Mission 
the 
Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo  has  provided 
logistical  assistance  to  the  institution,  in  particular  by 
housing  and  transporting  individuals.  The  Security 
Council’s  sanctions  Committee  facilitated  the  transfer 
of  Mr.  Labanga  to  the  Court  by  lifting  the  travel  ban 
that he was under so that he could be transferred to The 
Hague.  

Effective  cooperation  between  the  Court  and  the 
United Nations requires the coordination of efforts and 
the  sharing  of 
information.  The  Court  greatly 
appreciates the opportunity it to give an account of its 
work each year to the General Assembly. We cooperate 
regularly  with 
share 
information  with  the  Organization  by  other  means 
throughout  the  year.  I  am  pleased  to  inform  the 
Assembly that the Court has established a liaison office 
here  in  New  York  to  facilitate  this  cooperation.  The 
head of the office recently took up his post.  

Regional  organizations  can  provide  the  Court 
with  support  similar  to  that  provided  by  States  or  the 
United  Nations.  Support  from  organizations  that  are 
active  in  the  regions  where  the  Court  is  working  is 
particularly  important.  A  cooperation  agreement  was 
signed in April with the European Union, and we hope 
that  we  will  soon  conclude  an  agreement  with  the 
African  Union.  This  summer,  the  Prosecutor  and  I 
participated in a meeting with the African Union Peace 
and Security Council held at Addis Ababa. 

Like  some  other  representatives  of  the  Court,  I 
have also taken part in a number of meetings with the 
Organization  of  American  States.  We  are  doing  our 
utmost to strengthen those contacts. We have also been 
in  touch  with  other  regional  organizations,  and  we 
hope  to  strengthen  those  ties  in  the  near  future.  This 
emerging  system  of  international  justice  goes  beyond 
cooperation  with  the  ICC,  because  it  encompasses 
other institutions whose goal is to end impunity.  
We must bear in mind that ultimately it is the task

crime,  and  to  prosecute  those  who  committed  them. 
The ICC intervenes only when national jurisdictions do 
not  have  either  the  will  or  the  ability  to  properly 
conduct  the  investigation  or  the  prosecution.  In  this 
context,  in  order  to  maximize  the  ability  of  States  to 
put an end to impunity and to prevent the commission 
of  other  crimes,  States’  resources  for  combating  such 
crimes should perhaps be increased. 

Ad  hoc  tribunals  and  other  jurisdictions,  such  as 
the  Special  Court  for  Sierra  Leone,  have  similar 
objectives to ours. More and more, these international 
tribunals are assisting each other on a reciprocal basis 
with  a  view  to  carrying  out  their  respective  missions. 
The  ICC  has  made  available  to  the  Special  Court  for 
Sierra  Leone  buildings  and  services  in  The  Hague  so 
that  the  trial  of  Charles  Taylor  can  go  forward;  all 
expenses must be paid in advance by the Special Court.

international courts also meet together every year. 
(spoke in English) 

The  General  Assembly  has  previously  stressed 
that bringing to justice perpetrators of war crimes and 
massive  violations  of  human  rights  and  humanitarian 
law should contribute significantly to prevention. In his 
recent  progress  report  on  the  prevention  of  armed 
conflict  (A/60/891),  the  Secretary-General  observed 
that  the  ICC  is  already  having  an  effect  in  deterring 
such  crimes.  We  are  now  also  seeing  specific 
indications  from  different  sources  that  the  ICC  is 
having  an  impact  on  situations  where  it  is  active.  As 
proceedings  progress,  the  deterrent  effect  of  the  ICC 
should  increase  over  time,  as  envisioned  in  the 
preamble to the Rome Statute. 
In paragraph 108 of his report on the work of the 

Organization 
the 
Secretary-General  stated  that  the  establishment  of  the 
ICC  “demonstrated 
international  community’s 
commitment  to  a  permanent  and  universal  mechanism 
to ensure that as regards those most serious of crimes, 
impunity will not be tolerated”. 

The ICC has done and will continue to do its part 
in putting an end to impunity by fulfilling its mandate,

as  provided  for  in  the  Rome  Statute.  For  its  part,  the 
international community must see that its fundamental 
commitment  to  ending  impunity  is  upheld  and  must 
ensure the support and cooperation needed. 
Ms.  Lintonen  (Finland):  I  have  the  honour  to 

speak  on  behalf  of  the  European  Union  (EU).  The 
acceding  countries  Bulgaria  and  Romania, 
the 
candidate  countries  Turkey,  Croatia  and  the  former 
Yugoslav  Republic  of  Macedonia,  the  countries  of  the

and  Herzegovina, 
Montenegro  and  Serbia,  and  the  European  Free  Trade 
Association  country  Iceland,  member  of  the  European 
Economic Area, as well as Ukraine and the Republic of 
Moldova, align themselves with this statement. 

The  European  Union  is  firmly  committed  to

community.  The 
International Criminal Court (ICC) may well be seen as 
one  of  the  greatest  achievements  in  the  fight  against 
impunity  in  recent  times.  The  EU  reiterates  its  strong 
support for the work of the Court. 
The  importance  of  the  ICC  is  to  be  seen  in  the 

wider  context  of  international  order.  The  Court  is 
critically  placed  to  contribute  to  a  more  peaceful  and 
just  world,  promoting 
international 
humanitarian law, human rights and the rule of law.

has  a  greater  possibility  of  coming  to  terms  with  past

The  ICC  plays  a  significant  role  in  ensuring 
accountability  where  national  judicial  systems  have 
failed  or  are  not  willing  or  able  to  function.  As  for 
deterrence and prevention, the EU views the ICC as an 
essential  instrument  for  the  prevention  of  genocide, 
crimes  against  humanity  and  war  crimes. At  the  same 
time,  the  ICC  is  an  institution  for  exceptional  cases 
only. The  primary  responsibility  of  bringing  offenders 
to justice continues to rest with States. One could also 
speak  on  the  role  of  the  Court  in  mainstreaming 
accountability  for  the  most  serious  crimes  and  in 
strengthening  local  rule  of  law,  including  setting 
standards on due process.

The  EU  expresses 
justice.  The  EU  welcomes 

the 
President  of  the  ICC,  Judge  Philippe  Kirsch,  for 
presenting the second annual report on the work of the 
Court. The report clearly demonstrates that this body is 
a living institution, with the unsealing of the first arrest 
warrants  against  five  leaders  of  the  Lord’s  Resistance 
Army,  as  well  as  the  first  proceedings  against  an 
accused.  In  this  respect,  the  EU  welcomes  the  arrest 
and  surrender  of  Mr.  Lubanga  to  the  ICC  by  the 
authorities  of  the  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo 
and  his  subsequent 
to  The  Hague.  The 
investigations  into  the  situation  in  the  Sudan,  as 
referred  to  the  ICC  by  the  Security  Council,  should 
also be mentioned in this context. 

The EU supports the goal of the Court to become 
the centrepiece of an emerging system of international 
criminal 
the  Court’s 
increased  cooperation  with  other  international  and 
for  sharing 
hybrid 
experiences,  establishing  best  practices  and 
for 
ensuring  consistent  interpretation  and  application  of 
the law. In particular, we welcome cooperation with the 
Special Court for Sierra Leone, with a view to facilitate 
that Court’s implementation of its mandate. 

Furthermore,  the  European  Union  cherishes  the 
deepened cooperation with international organizations, 
in  particular  with  the  United  Nations.  The  United 
Nations is a critical partner to the ICC in the field, as it 
may  be  in  a  position  to  provide  the  Court  with 
evidence or logistical support. We are pleased that the 
liaison office of the ICC to the United Nations has just 
been  established.  The  EU  wishes 
its 
appreciation  and  heartfelt  thanks  to  the  Secretary-
General  for  his  valuable  support  extended  to  the  ICC 
throughout  his  term  and  requests  him  to  make  this 
support even more tangible on the ground. 
to  have  concluded  an 

agreement  with 
in  April 
this  year  on 
cooperation  and  assistance,  and  it  encourages  other 
relevant organizations, including the African Union, to 
formalize their cooperation with the Court. 

The  European  Union  is  a  strong  and  active 
advocate  for  the  universality  of  the  ICC,  and  a 
dedicated defender of the integrity of the Rome Statute. 
The EU reiterates its call upon all States that have not 
yet done so to ratify or accede to the Rome Statute, as 
well as to the agreement on privileges and immunities 
of the Court. The EU is willing, within its established

mechanisms,  to  assist  with  the  ratification  process  of 
the Statute or with its implementation. 

As the ICC is now truly operational, the effective 
cooperation  and  assistance  by  States,  as  well  as  the 
United  Nations  and  other  international  and  regional 
organizations  extended  to  the  Court  has  become  more 
important.  Bringing  the  perpetrators  of  the  most 
serious  crimes  to  justice  is  not  only  in  the  interest  of 
victims  and  affected  communities,  but  also  serves  the 
interests of the international community as a whole. 
As  the  ICC  does  not  have  enforcement  capacity, 

assistance  is  particularly  needed  for  the  arrest  of 
suspects,  the  provision  of  evidence,  the  relocation  of 
witnesses and the enforcement of sentences. Under the 
Rome  Statute, 
that  bear 
responsibility  for  arresting  suspects  and  delivering 
them  to  the  Court  for  prosecution.  We  call  on  all 
concerned to fully extend such cooperation. 
The EU welcomes the work done by the Court to 

develop  its  strategic  plan  and  urges  the  Court  to 
continue  its  consideration  and  work  in  this  area.  The 
EU also invites the Court to continue the dialogue with 
the State parties that has now been initiated. 

The  EU  welcomes  also  the  ICC’s  intensified 
efforts  relating  to  its  outreach  activities  in  the  field. 
Reaching out to societies and people affected by crime 
is  extremely  important  for  the  successful  discharge  of 
the  wider  mandate  of  the  Court.  The  activities  of  the 
Court  in  this  respect  are  particularly  important  when 
reaching  out  to  victims  who  have  an  internationally 
unique  role  under  the  Rome  Statute.  The  EU  looks 
forward  to  discussing  the  Court’s  strategic  plan  for 
outreach  at  the  meeting  of  the  Assembly  of  States 
Parties later this year. 

Finally, the EU wishes to thank the Liechtenstein 
Institute on Self-Determination at Princeton University, 
as  well  as  Ambassador  Christian  Wenaweser  and  his 
staff,  for  organizing  at  Princeton  last  June  the  third 
Intersessional  Meeting  of  the  Special  Working  Group 
on  the  Crime  of  Aggression.  These  meetings  have 
proved  to  be  highly  conducive  for  the  preparation  of 
provisions  relating  to  the  crime  of  aggression,  the 
definition  of  which  is  of  interest  to  United  Nations 
Members as a whole. The European Union encourages 
the widest possible participation at the meetings of the 
Special Working  Group,  which  is  open  to  all  Member 
States of the United Nations.

report  details 
Mrs. Ferrari (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): 

I  have  the  honour  to  speak  on  behalf  of  the  Member 
States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). 

We  thank  the  President  of  the  International 
Criminal  Court  (ICC),  Judge  Philippe  Kirsch,  for 
introducing the second annual report of the ICC to the 
United  Nations  (A/61/217).  CARICOM  notes  with 
satisfaction  the  progress  made  in  the  development  of 
the Court into a fully functioning judicial institution. In 
particular, 
significant 
milestones in the activities of the Court, including the 
first warrants of arrest for five members of the Lord’s 
Resistance Army  (LRA)  who  are  charged  with  crimes 
against humanity and war  crimes. As the report notes, 
none  of  the  five  LRA  members  has  as  yet  been 
arrested,  since  the  Court  does  not  have  its  own  police 
force and must rely on the cooperation of States. 

We call on the Member States concerned to offer 
full and unconditional cooperation to the Court so that 
the  judicial  process  may  be  continued  and  justice 
delivered.  We  commend 
that  have 
cooperated  in  the  arrest  and  surrender  to  the  Court  of 
Thomas  Lubanga  Dyilo,  who  is  charged  with  war 
crimes,  including  the  enlistment  and  conscription  of 
children under the age of 16. The Court was thus able 
to bring its first proceedings against an accused.  

It  is  vitally  important  for  the  credibility  and 
international recognition of the Court that it is seen to 
be  functioning  appropriately  in  its  role  in  bringing  to 
justice  those  responsible  for  crimes  of  genocide,  war 
crimes  and  crimes  against  humanity,  which  have 
caused such great suffering and oppression to the weak 
and  vulnerable  populations  of  the  world.  Thus,  we 
cannot  stress  highly  enough  the  need  for  its  judicial 
officers and other staff to remain highly motivated and 
committed,  and  for  all  States  Members  of  the  United 
Nations  to  cooperate  fully  with  the  Court  as  it  strives 
to perform its critical role. 

At this juncture, CARICOM member States wish 
to 
underline 
of 
cooperation  of  the  international  community  with  the 
Court  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  Court  successfully 
fulfils its mandate. As established in the Rome Statute, 
the  principle  of  complementarity  permits  the  State 
concerned to exercise the first option to try the persons 
responsible for the crime within the jurisdiction of the 
Court.  However,  when  the  Court  must  act,  it  must  be 
able  to  rely  on  Member  States,  international  and 
the 
fundamental

regional organizations, civil society and other actors. It 
is essential that they provide the necessary cooperation 
and assistance to the Court in its many tasks, including 
the  provision  of  evidence,  the  carrying  out  of  arrest 
warrants  and  the  surrender  of  accused  persons  to  the 
Court, and in the area of the protection and relocation 
of witnesses. For example, the cooperation provided by 
the  Governments  of  the  Democratic  Republic  of  the 
Congo, Uganda and Chad has enabled the Office of the 
Prosecutor 
its 
investigations  relating  to  the  situations  before  the 
Court.  

We  commend  the  work  of  the  Office  of  the 
Prosecutor, some of which puts the staff of that Office 
at  risk.  We  are  encouraged  by  the  progress  made 
towards bringing to trial the persons responsible for the 
situations  being  investigated,  and  by  the  Office’s 
contribution  to  the  development  of  the  work  of  the 
Court.  

In  addition,  the  Court  cannot  conduct  its  many 
functions without the necessary financial resources. We 
therefore  wish  to  encourage  States  parties  which  have 
not  yet  done  so  to  pay  their  assessed  contributions  to 
the Court in full and on time. 

We view the cooperation agreements entered into 
by  the  Court  and  other  actors  as  progressive  steps 
towards  the  successful  operation  of  the  Court.  In  this 
regard, we welcome the agreements signed between the 
Court  and  the  European  Union  and  the  International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and note that the 
ICRC  has  already  conducted  a  visit  to  the  Detention 
Centre. We look forward to the imminent conclusion of 
the  agreements  currently  being  negotiated  with  the 
African  Union 
the  Asian-African  Legal 
Consultative  Organization  and  to  the  benefits  which 
will flow to the Court as a result. 

Another  important  area  of  cooperation  with  the 
Court is the indication by States of their willingness to 
accept  sentenced  persons  to  serve  their  sentences  on 
their territories. We hope that the agreement concluded 
between  the  Court  and  the  Government  of Austria  for 
the acceptance of persons sentenced by the Court is the 
first  of  many  such  agreements  with  States.  Therefore, 
we  encourage  those  States  in  a  position  to  do  so  to 
offer  to  accept  persons  sentenced  by  the  Court  in 
accordance with the Statute.

success. The Relationship Agreement, signed two years 
ago  by  the  President  of  the  Court  and  the  Secretary-
General  of  the  United  Nations  on  behalf  of  their 
respective institutions affirms the independence  of the 
Court while at the same time establishing a framework 
for

the  United  Nations.  The  Agreement  articulates  the 
unique  cooperation  between  these  two  institutions  in 
their  shared  goals  of  maintaining  international  peace 
and  security  and  should  be  fully  respected  and 
implemented by both parties.  

the  operational  cooperation 
between the United Nations and the Court rendered by 
the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo (MONUC) to the ICC in the Democratic 
Republic  of  the  Congo  relevant  to  the  arrest  and 
surrender  of  Mr.  Lubanga  Dyilo,  is  a  positive  step  in 
the relationship. 

We  also  welcome  the  establishment  of  the  New 
York  liaison  office  of  the  Court  and  the  recent 
appointment  of  the  head  of  that  Office.  It  will  further 
facilitate  cooperation  between  the  two  institutions 
under  the  Relationship Agreement. As  the  face  of  the 
Court  in  New  York,  the  office  will  provide  States, 
international  and  regional  organizations,  civil  society 
and  individuals  with  a  venue  for  recourse  on  matters 
which  they  believe  to  be  of  concern.  The  office  will 
also  facilitate  the  meetings  of  the Assembly  of  States 
Parties  in  New  York.  Similarly,  CARICOM  strongly 
supports  the  holding  of  meetings  of  the  Assembly  in 
New  York  in  order  to  ensure  wider  participation  by 
States  parties  and  observer  States,  since  all  States, 
developed  and  developing,  already  have  diplomatic 
representation in New York. 

CARICOM  warmly  welcomes  the  two  most 
recent  States  parties  to  the  Rome  Statute,  one  of  our 
own,  Saint  Kitts  and  Nevis,  as  well  as  the  Comoros, 
thus  bringing  the  number  of  States  parties  to  102. We 
encourage  other  members  of 
international 
community to become States parties, so that the goal of 
universal  ratification  may  become  a  reality.  We  also 
urge States parties to ratify or accede to the Agreement 
on Privileges and Immunities of the Court, as well as to 
enact  the  necessary  implementing  legislation  for  both 
those important instruments. 

CARICOM  is  pleased  that  the  Trust  Fund  for 
Victims is now becoming a reality and commends those

24

whose  hard  work  and  commitment  has  made  this 
possible. We welcomed the election earlier this year of 
the new member of the Board of Directors of the Trust 
Fund,  former  President  of  Trinidad  and  Tobago, 
Mr. A.N.R.  Robinson.  We  encourage  States 
in  a 
position to do so to contribute to the Fund. The ICC is 
the  first  court  that  recognizes  the  role  of  victims  by 
enabling them and their families to seek reparation for 
genocide and other crimes against humanity.  

We  commend  the  work  being  undertaken  by  the 
Court to provide support and assistance to victims, and 
enable  their  participation  in  the  proceedings  of  the 
Court, as appropriate. It is important that, in so doing, 
the  rights  of  the  defendants  enshrined  in  the  Rome 
Statute are fully respected and upheld. 

The  outreach  activities  in  which  the  Court  is 
engaged  are  far-reaching.  We  encourage  such  contact 
with  local  communities,  especially  those  affected  by 
the  situations  under  investigation.  We  believe  that 
spreading the message of the Court through interaction 
at the grassroots level with, inter alia, local journalists 
and  media,  legal  associations  and  non-governmental 
organizations,  is  an  important  tool  of  the  Court  for 
reaching  out  to  victims  and  informing  them  of  the 
possibilities  for  their  participation  in  the  process  and 
for reparations. 

In  closing,  CARICOM  member  States  wish  to 
reaffirm  our  support  for  and  commitment  to  the  ICC. 
We are aware of the important role of the Court in the 
international  community  and  the  fact  that  it  remains, 
for  some  victims  of  genocide,  war  crimes  and  crimes 
against  humanity,  the  last  bastion  of  hope  for  justice 
and  compensation.  We  must  strive  to  protect  the 
integrity  of  the  Court  and  encourage  others  to  do  so, 
including not only States parties and States concerned, 
but international and regional organizations as well as 
non-governmental  organizations 
in  such  areas  as 
preserving and providing evidence, sharing information 

A/61/PV.26
and securing the arrest and surrender of persons to the 
Court. It is the hope of the CARICOM States that this 
cooperation will be willingly given to enable to Court 
to  fulfil  its  mandate  and  meet  the  complex  challenges 
that lie ahead.
