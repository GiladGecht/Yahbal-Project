Agenda item 103 
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs 
(a)  Election of five non-permanent members of the 
Security Council 
The  President: The  General Assembly  will  now 

proceed to the election of five non-permanent members 
of  the  Security  Council  to  replace  those  members 
whose term of office expires on 31 December 2006. 

The  five  outgoing  non-permanent  members  are 
the following: Argentina, Denmark, Greece, Japan and 
the  United  Republic  of  Tanzania.  Those  five  States 
cannot  be  re-elected.  Their  names,  therefore,  should 
not appear on the ballot papers. 

Apart  from  the  five  permanent  members,  the 
Security  Council  will  include  in  the  year  2007  the 

following  States:  the  Congo,  Ghana,  Peru,  Qatar  and 
Slovakia. The names of those States, therefore, should 
also not appear on the ballot papers. 

Of  the  five  non-permanent  members  that  will 
remain in office in the year 2007, three are from Africa 
and Asia, one is from Eastern Europe and one is from 
Latin America and the Caribbean. 

Consequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General 
Assembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII), of 17 December 
1963,  the  five  non-permanent  members  should  be 
elected  according  to  the  following  pattern:  two  from 
Africa  and  Asia,  one  from  Latin  America  and  the 
Caribbean  and  two  from  Western  Europe  and  other 
States. The ballot papers reflect that pattern. 

In  accordance  with  established  practice,  there  is 
an understanding to the effect that, of the two States to 
be  elected  from Africa  and Asia,  one  should  be  from 
Africa and one from Asia. 

I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  those 
candidates,  their  number  not  exceeding  the  number  of 
seats  to  be  filled,  receiving  the  greatest  number  of 
votes  and  a  two-thirds  majority  of  those  present  and 
voting will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote 
for  a  remaining  seat,  there  will  be  a  restricted  ballot 
limited to those candidates that have obtained an equal 
number of votes. 

that procedure? 

May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to

The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the 
rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret 
ballot and there shall be no nominations. 

Regarding candidatures, I have been informed by 
the  Chairpersons  of  the  respective  regional  groups  of 
the following. For the two vacant seats from among the 
African  and  Asian  States,  there  are  three  candidates, 
namely,  Indonesia,  Nepal  and  South  Africa.  Of  those 
three  candidates,  South  Africa 
is  an  endorsed 
candidate.  For  the  one  vacant  seat  from  among  the 
Latin  America  and  Caribbean  States,  there  are  two 
candidates,  namely,  Guatemala  and  the  Bolivarian 
Republic  of Venezuela.  For  the  two  vacant  seats  from 
among  the  Western  European  and  other  States,  there 
are  two  endorsed  candidates,  namely,  Belgium  and 
Italy. 

In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of 
procedure,  we  shall  now  proceed  to  the  election  by 
secret ballot. 

Before we begin the voting process, I should like 
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the 
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no 
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a 
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting. 
We shall now begin the voting process. 


Ballot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” will now 
be  distributed.  I  request  representatives  to  use  only 
those ballot papers that have been distributed. 

May  I  ask  representatives  to  write  on  the  ballot 
papers  marked  “A”,  for  the African  and Asian  States, 
the  names  of  the  two  States  for  which  they  wish  to 
vote;  on  the  ballot  papers  marked  “B”,  for  the  Latin 
American  and  Caribbean  States,  the  name  of  the  one 
State  for  which  they  wish  to  vote;  and  on  the  ballot 
papers  marked  “C”,  for  the  Western  European  and 
other States, the name of the two States for which they 
wish to vote. 
A  ballot  paper  containing  more  names  from  the 

relevant region than the number of seats assigned to it 
will  be  declared  invalid.  If  a  ballot  paper  contains 
names  of  Member  States  which  do  not  belong  to  that 
region, those names will not be counted at all.
