balloting  by  secret  ballot.  This  seventeenth  round  of 
balloting, which in accordance with rule 94 of the rules 
of  procedure,  will  also  be  the  seventh  unrestricted 
ballot.  
May  I  remind  the  Assembly  that  any  Member 

State  from  among  the  Latin  American  and  Caribbean 
States  may  be  a  candidate  except  those  outgoing 
members  and  those  already  members  of  the  Security 
Council, namely, Argentina and Peru. 

Before we begin the voting process, I should like 
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the 
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no 
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a 
point  of  order  on  the  actual  conduct  of  the  voting.
