presidency  to  clarify,  before  the  end  of  the  day,  how 
the  process  will  be  structured  —  without,  of  course,

regarding 
candidatures and so on. We have other committee work 
and engagements. My proposal, therefore, is to devote 
two or three days per week to this issue. I also propose 
that  the  General Assembly  take  into  consideration  the 
Id  al-Fitr  holiday,  and  not  schedule  any  votes  on 
Monday and Tuesday. 
The Acting  President: The  presidency  will  take 

into  account  the  comments  of  the  Ambassador  of 
Egypt. 

For  the  twenty-third  round  of  balloting,  may  I 
remind  the  Assembly  that  any  Member  State  from 
among  the  Group  of  Latin  American  and  Caribbean 
States  may  be  a  candidate,  except  those  out-going 
members  and  those  already  members  of  the  Security 
Council, namely, Argentina and Peru. 

Before we begin the voting process, I should like 
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the 
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no 
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a 
point  of  order  on  the  actual  conduct  of  the  voting. 
Members  are  requested  to  remain  seated  until  all 
ballots have been collected.  
We shall now begin the voting process. 


Ballot  papers  marked  “B”  will  now  be

Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs 
  (a)  Election of five non-permanent members of the

The  Acting  President:  The  General  Assembly 

will now proceed to the election of five non-permanent 
members  of  the  Security  Council  to  replace  those 
members whose term of office expires on 31 December 
2006. 

As  members  will  recall,  when  the  35th  plenary 
meeting  was  adjourned,  on  Tuesday  afternoon, 
17 October 2006, there remained one seat from among 
the  Latin American  and  Caribbean  States  to  be  filled. 
In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of  procedure, 
we shall now proceed to the next round of balloting by 
secret ballot. This twenty-third round of balloting will, 
in  accordance  with  rule  94  of  the  rules  of  procedure, 
also be the tenth unrestricted ballot.

Mr.  Abdelaziz  (Egypt):  I  have  a  procedural 

question before we begin the balloting. We would like 
to propose that we establish some kind of a timeframe 
for  the  voting  process,  because  we  have  committee 
meetings and other engagements and matters to attend
