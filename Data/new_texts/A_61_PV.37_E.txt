Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs 

  (a)  Election of five non-permanent members of the 
today, 
Security Council 
The  President:  The  General  Assembly  will 

continue  with  the  election  of  five  non-permanent 
members  of  the  Security  Council  to  replace  those 
members whose term of office expires on 31 December 
2006. 

As  members  will  recall,  when  the  36th  plenary 
meeting  was  adjourned  earlier 
there  still 
remained one seat from among the Latin American and 
Caribbean States to be filled. 

In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of 
procedure,  we  shall  now  proceed  to  the  next  round  of 
balloting by secret ballot. 

This  thirtieth  round  of  balloting,  in  accordance 
with rule 94 of the rules of procedure, will also be the 
fourteenth unrestricted ballot. 

For this thirtieth round of balloting, may I remind 
the Assembly  that  any  Member  State  from  among  the 
Latin  American  and  Caribbean  States  may  be  a 
candidate  except  those  outgoing  members  and  those 
already  members  of  the  Security  Council,  namely 
Argentina and Peru. 
We shall now begin the voting process. 
Members are requested to remain seated until all 


ballots have been collected. 

Ballot  papers  marked  “B”  will  now  be 
distributed.  May  I  ask  representatives  to  write  on  the 
ballot  papers  marked  “B”  for  the  Latin American  and 
Caribbean States the name of one State for which they 
wish  to  vote.  Ballot  papers  marked  “B”  will  be 
declared invalid if they contain the name of more than 
one State. 

If a ballot paper contains the name of a Member 
State which does not belong to that region, that ballot 
will be declared invalid.

(Brunei  Darussalam),  Mr.  Sepúlveda  (Chile), 
Mrs.  Cerere  (Kenya),  Mr.  Flueck  (Switzerland)
