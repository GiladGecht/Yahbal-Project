  Letter from the Secretary-General to the 
President of the General Assembly (A/61/509) 
  Letter from the President of the Security 
Council to the President of the General 
Assembly (A/61/548) 

The  Acting  President  (spoke  in  Arabic):  In 
document A/61/509, the Secretary-General transmitted 
a  letter  dated  23 August  2006  from  Judge  Erik  Møse, 
President  of  the  International  Criminal  Tribunal  for 
Rwanda  (ICTR),  that  directly  relates  to  the  ability  of 
the International Tribunal to implement its completion 
strategy. 

In  his  letter,  the  Secretary-General  reports  that

that, 
The  Secretary-General  also  reports 

in 
accordance  with  General Assembly  resolution  57/289, 
should  the  cumulative  period  of  service  of  ad  litem 
judges  amount  to  three  years  or  more,  this  will  not 
result  in  any  change  in  their  entitlements  and  benefits 
and,  in  particular,  will  not  give  rise  to  any  additional 
entitlements  or  benefits  other  than  those  that  already 
exist,  which  will,  in  such  an  eventuality,  be  extended 
pro rata by virtue of the extension of their service. 

In  document  A/61/548,  the  President  of  the 
Security  Council  transmits  to  the  President  of  the 
General Assembly  the  text  of  Council  resolution  1717 
(2006), of 13 October 2006, whereby the Council, inter 
alia:

A/61/PV.45 

after the election of new ad litem judges. He therefore 
wishes  to  be  able  to  request  the  appointment  of  ad 
litem judges to new trials as soon as possible. 

The  President  indicates  that  this  may  include, 
depending on their  expertise and  availability, not only 
ad  litem  judges  who  have  previously  been  appointed, 
but  also  ad  litem  judges  who  have  not  yet  been 
appointed to serve at the International Tribunal. He has 
accordingly  requested  that  the  terms  of  the  remaining 
eight  ad 
judges  also  be  extended  until 
31 December 2008. 

As  the  statute  of  the  International  Tribunal  does 
not  provide  for  extending  the  term  of  office  of  the 
ad litem  judges,  the  approval  of  the  Security  Council, 
as the parent organ of the International Tribunal, and of 
the  General  Assembly,  as  the  organ  that  elects  its 
judges, would be needed in order to extend the term of 
office  of  all  the  ad  litem  judges  of  the  International 
Tribunal  elected  on  25  June  2003.  The  Secretary-
General, therefore, requests that the General Assembly 
and the Security Council grant such approval. 

Furthermore,  in  his  letter  the  Secretary-General 
reports  that  the  approval  of  the  Security  Council  and 
the General Assembly is needed to allow Judges Bossa, 
Arrey,  Lattanzi,  Muthoga,  Short,  Hökborg,  Hikmet, 
Kam  and  Park  to  serve  in  the  International  Tribunal 
beyond  the  cumulative  period  of  service  provided  for 
under  article  12  ter,  paragraph  2,  of  the  statute  of  the 
International Tribunal and until 31 December 2008. 


Article 12 ter, paragraph 2, provides that: 

“During  their  term,  ad  litem  judges  will  be 
appointed by the Secretary-General, upon request 
of  the  President  of  the  International Tribunal  for 
Rwanda, to serve in the Trial Chambers for one or 
more trials, for a cumulative period of up to, but 
not including, three years”. 

The Secretary-General therefore requests that the 
General Assembly and the Security Council grant such 
approval. 

The  Secretary-General  reports  that,  as  far  as  the 
financial  consequences  of  the  President’s  proposal  are 
concerned,  ad  litem  judges  will  have  their  terms 
extended  only  until  the  date  when  the  completion  of 
trials is foreseen. The Security Council and the General 
Assembly  would  then,  in  2008,  be  able  to  review  the 
status of the International Tribunal’s ad litem judges.

31  December  2008  the  term  of  office  of  the

 Letter from the Permanent Representative of

Assembly (A/61/296) 
The  Acting  President  (spoke  in  Arabic):  The 

Assembly  will  first  proceed  to  a  by-election  to  elect 
two  members  of  the  Economic  and  Social  Council,  in 
accordance with rule 140 of the rules of procedure. In 
this connection, I would first like to draw the attention 
of  members  to  document  A/61/89,  containing  a  letter 
dated 7 June 2006 from the Permanent  Representative 
of Spain to the United Nations, in which he announces 
that  Spain  would  like  to  relinquish  its  seat  on  the 
Economic  and  Social  Council  for  the  remainder  of  its 
term in favour of Portugal. 

I  would  also  like  to  draw  the  attention  of 
members  to  document  A/61/296,  containing  a  letter 
dated  21  August  2006 
the  Permanent 
Representative  of  Turkey  to  the  United  Nations,  in 
which  he  announces 
to

In accordance with rule 92, we shall now proceed 

As a result, two vacancies will occur and two new 
members must therefore be elected to fill the unexpired 
terms  of  office  of  Spain  and  Turkey,  commencing  on 
1 January  2007  and  expiring  31  December  2008.  In 
accordance  with  paragraph  4  of  General  Assembly 
resolution  2847  (XXVI),  of  20  December  1971,  and 
taking into account that the vacancies will occur from 
among the Western European and other States, the two 
new  members  should  therefore  be  elected  from  that 
region.  

I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  the 
candidate 
two-thirds  majority  of 
members  present  and  voting  will  be  declared  elected. 
In  the  case  of  a  tie  vote,  there  will  be  a  special 
restricted  ballot  limited  to  those  candidates  that  have 
obtained  an  equal  number  of  votes.  May  I  take  it  that 
the General Assembly agrees to the procedure?  
It was so decided. 

In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of 

procedure,  the  election  shall  be  held  by  secret  ballot

I  should  like  to  inform  members  that  as  of 
1 January 2007, the following States from the Group of 
Western European and other States will be represented 
on 
the  Economic  and  Social  Council:  Australia, 
Austria,  Denmark,  France,  Germany,  Iceland  and  the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 
Therefore  the  names  of  these  seven  States  should  not 
appear on the ballot.  

Before we begin the voting process, I should like 
to remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules 
of  procedure,  no  representative  shall  interrupt  the 
voting except on a point of order on the actual conduct 
of the vote. I hope that delegates will cooperate during 
the elections and remind them that there should be no 
lobbying  during  the  ballots. That  means  that  once  the 
voting  has  started,  no  campaign  or  other  material 
should be distributed. I call on all delegates to stay in 
their  seats  so  that  we  can  hold  the  election  in  an 
orderly  manner.  I

Ballot  papers  will  now  be  distributed.  I  request 
representatives to use only those ballot papers that are 
being distributed and to write on them the names of the 
two States for which they wish to vote. A ballot paper 
containing  more  than  two  names  from  the  region  will 
be  declared  invalid.  If  a  ballot  paper  contains  the 
names  of  Member  States  which  do  not  belong  to  the 
region, those names will not be counted at all.

point of order. 
Mr. Diarra (Mali) (spoke in French): I am sorry 

to interrupt the voting process, but my delegation is not 
clear on what is at stake in these elections. It was our 
understanding  that  there  were  four  candidates  from 
among  the  Group  of  Western  European  and  other 
States, and that Portugal and Greece were also added to 
the  list.  My  delegation  would  like  some  clarifications 
before voting.

said  earlier,  the  General Assembly  is  now  proceeding 
to a by-election to elect two members of the Economic

rules of procedure.

the  Permanent  Representative  of  Spain  to  the  United 
Nations announcing that Spain would like to relinquish 
its  seat  on  the  Economic  and  Social  Council  for  the 
remaining  term,  in  favour  of  Portugal,  and  to  a  letter 
from  the  Permanent  Representative  of  Turkey  to  the 
United  Nations  announcing  that  Turkey  would  like  to 
relinquish  its  seat  on  the  Council  for  the  term  2006-
2008, in favour of Greece.

The  General  Assembly  will  next  turn  to  the

1971, and taking into account the number of States that 
will  remain  members  of  the  Council  after  1  January 
2007,  the  18  members  should  be  elected  as  follows: 
five  from African  States,  four  from Asian  States,  two 
from  Eastern  European  States, 
three  from  Latin 
American and Caribbean States and four from Western 
European  and  other  States.  The  ballot  papers  reflect

seats  to  be  filled,  that  receive  the  greatest  number  of 
votes  and  a  two-thirds  majority  of  members  present

This  restricted  ballot  has  once  again  been 
inconclusive.  There  still  remains  one  seat  to  be  filled 
from among the Eastern European States. 

In  accordance  with  the  rules  of  procedure,  we 
should  continue  with  the  series  of  restricted  ballots. 
However, in view of the lateness of the hour, I propose 
that we postpone further balloting until 3 p.m. today. 



It was so decided.
