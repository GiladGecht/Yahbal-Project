Before we begin the voting process, I should like 
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the

Ballot  papers marked  “C” will  now  be  distributed. 
May I ask representatives to write on the ballot papers the 
name  of  one  State  for  which  they  wish  to  vote.  Ballot 
papers marked “C”, for the Eastern European States, will 
be declared invalid if they contain the name of State other

will now continue with the election of 18 members of 
the  Economic  and  Social  Council  to  replace  those 
members whose term of office expires on 31 December 
2006. 

As  members  will  recall,  when  the  45th  plenary 
meeting  was  adjourned  this  morning,  there  remained 
one seat from among the Eastern European States to be 
filled.  In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of 
procedure,  we  shall  now  proceed  to  the  next  round  of 
balloting by secret ballot. The third round of balloting 
will,  in  accordance  with  rule  94  of  the  rules  of 
procedure, also be the second restricted ballot. 

This third round of balloting shall be restricted to 
the two States from among the Eastern European States 
that  were  not  elected  but  obtained  the  largest  number 
of  votes  in  the  previous  ballot,  namely,  Belarus  and 
Bulgaria.  That  is  in  accordance  with  rule  94  of  the 
rules of procedure.

This restricted ballot has again been inconclusive. 
There  remains  one  seat  to  be  filled  from  among  the 
Eastern European States. 
In  accordance  with  the  rules  of  procedure,  we 

should  continue  with  a  series  of  restricted  ballots. 
However, in  view of the lateness of the hour, unless  I 
hear any objection, I propose that we postpone further 
balloting  until  the  morning  of  Tuesday,  7  November 
2006. 

It was so decided. 




Programme of work 
The  Acting  President:  In  connection  with  the 

meeting  of  the  General  Assembly  to  be  held  on 
Tuesday,  7  November,  I  wish  to  inform  members  that 
we shall first continue with the election of the members 
of  the  Security  Council. Thereafter,  we  shall  continue 
with the election of the members of the Economic and 
Social  Council.  In  connection  with  the  Economic  and 
Social Council election, I would also like to announce 
to  members 
the 
delegation  of Australia  that  it  wishes  to  relinquish  its 
seat  on  the  Economic  and  Social  Council  for  the 
remainder  of  its  term,  in  favour  of  New  Zealand. 
Consequently,  the Assembly  will  conduct  another  by-
election to fill that seat. 

The meeting rose at 6.35 p.m.
that  I  have  been 
informed  by
