Agenda item 105 
Elections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and 
other elections 
  (a)  Election of seven members of the Committee for 
Programme and Coordination 
The  President:  Pursuant  to  General  Assembly 

decision  42/450  of  17  December  1987  and  upon 
nomination  by  the  Economic  and  Social  Council,  the 
Assembly  elects  the  members  of  the  Committee  for 
Programme and Coordination. 
The Assembly  has  before  it  document A/61/227, 

which  contains  the  nominations  by  the  Economic  and 
Social  Council  to  fill  the  vacancies  in  the  Committee 
that  will  occur  as  a  result  of  the  expiration,  on 
31 December  2006,  of  the  terms  of  office  of  the 
Bahamas,  the  Comoros,  France,  Mexico,  the  Russian 
Federation, 
the  United  States  of  America  and 
Zimbabwe. Those States are eligible for immediate re-
election. 
I  should  like  to  remind  members  that,  after  1 

the  following  States  will  still  be 
January  2007, 
members  of 
the  Committee:  Algeria,  Argentina, 
Armenia, Belarus, Benin, Brazil, Bulgaria, the Central 
African  Republic,  China,  Cuba,  Ghana, 
India, 
Indonesia,  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Iran,  Israel,  Italy, 
Jamaica, 
the 
Republic of Korea, Senegal, South Africa, Switzerland 
and  Uruguay.  Therefore,  those  26  States  are  not 
eligible in this election. 

I  should  now  like  to  inform  Members  that  the 
following States have been nominated by the Economic 
Japan,  Kenya,  Pakistan,  Portugal, 
A/61/PV.54
and  Social  Council:  the  two  African  States  for  two 
vacancies  are  the  Comoros  and  Zimbabwe;  the  one 
Eastern European State for one vacancy is the Russian 
Federation; and the two Latin American and Caribbean 
States  for  two  vacancies  are  Haiti  and  the  Bolivarian 
Republic  of  Venezuela.  For  the  two  vacancies  to  be 
filled  from  Western  European  and  other  States,  the 
Council has not yet decided on the nominations. 

In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of 
procedure, all elections should be held by secret ballot 
and  there  shall  be  no  nominations.  However,  I  should 
like  to  recall  paragraph  16  of  General  Assembly 
decision  34/401,  whereby  the  practice  of  dispensing 
with the secret ballot for elections to subsidiary organs 
when  the  number  of  candidates  corresponds  to  the 
number  of  seats  to  be  filled  should  become  standard 
unless  a  delegation  specifically  requests  a  vote  on  a 
given election. 

In the absence of such a request, may I take it that 
the Assembly decides to proceed to the election on the 
basis of dispensing with the secret ballot? 

It was so decided. 
The President: The number of States nominated 

from  among  the African  States,  the  Eastern  European 
States and the Latin American and Caribbean States is 
equal  to  the  number  of  seats  to  be  filled  in  each  of 
those groups. 

May I therefore take it that the Assembly wishes 
to declare those States nominated by the Economic and 
Social  Council  from  among  the  African  States,  the 
Eastern  European  States  and  the  Latin  American  and 
Caribbean  States  —  the  Comoros,  Haiti,  the  Russian 
Federation,  the  Bolivarian  Republic  of  Venezuela  and 
Zimbabwe  —  elected  members  of  the  Committee  for 
Programme  and  Coordination  for  a  three-year  term  of 
office beginning on 1 January 2007? 
It was so decided. 

The President: I congratulate the five States that 

have  been  elected  members  of  the  Committee  for 
Programme  and  Coordination.  Regarding 
two 
remaining  vacancies 
the  Western 
European  and other States, the  General Assembly will 
be in a position to act on it upon the nomination by the 
Economic  and  Social  Council  of  two  Member  States 
from that region.

The President: In accordance with the provisions 
of  Chapter  I  of  the  statute  of  the  Commission,  the  34 
members  of  the  Commission  are  to  be  elected  by  the 
General  Assembly  for  a  five-year  term  of  office 
beginning on 1 January 2007 from a list of candidates 
nominated  by  the  Governments  of  States  Members  of 
the United Nations. 
The members of the Commission are eligible for 

the 
re-election.  The 
Commission  is  set  out  in  the  annex  to  document 
A/61/92. 

The  notes  by  the  Secretary-General  concerning 
the candidates are contained in documents A/61/92 and 
Corrigendum 1 and Addenda 1 to 3. 

Members will recall that the Assembly, at its 41st 
plenary  meeting  on  26  October  2006,  decided  to 
request  the  Secretary-General  to  issue  a  consolidated 
list, 
incorporating  new  candidates  and  additional 
information  on  candidates  received  subsequent  to  the 
deadline for the submission of nominations. 

In that connection, the Assembly now has before 
it  the  note  by  the  Secretary-General  circulated  as 
document A/61/539, which consolidates in alphabetical 
order  the  candidates  nominated  by  Governments  of 
States  Members  of  the  United  Nations  for  election  to

The  notes  by  the  Secretary-General  concerning 
the  statements  of  qualifications  of  candidates  are 
contained in documents A/61/111 and Corrigenda 1 and 
2 and Addendum 1. 
There  is  a  total  of  44  candidates  eligible  in  this 
to 
those  candidates,  up 

I  should  like  to  recall  for  members  that,  in 
accordance  with  the  statute  of  the  International  Law 
Commission, 
the  Commission  should  consist  of 
persons of recognized competence in international law; 
the  persons  to  be  elected  to  the  Commission  should 
individually possess the qualifications required; and in 
the Commission as a whole, representation of the main 
forms of civilization and of the principal legal systems 
of the world should be assured. 
Pursuant  to  paragraph  3  of  General  Assembly 

resolution  36/39  of  18  November  1981, 
the  34 
members should be  elected as follows:  eight nationals 
from African States; seven nationals from Asian States; 
four  nationals  from  Eastern  European  States;  seven 
nationals  from  Latin  American  and  Caribbean  States; 
and  eight  nationals  from  Western  European  and  other 
States. The ballot papers reflect that pattern. 
As provided for in the statute of the International 

Law  Commission, 
the 
maximum  number  prescribed  for  each  regional  group, 
receiving the greatest number of votes and not less than 
a  majority  of  the  votes  of  the  Member  States  present 
and voting shall be declared elected. Should there be a 
case  of  a  tie  vote  for  a  remaining  seat,  the  General 
Assembly  will  proceed  to  a  special  restricted  ballot 
limited to those candidates who have obtained an equal 
number of votes. 

that procedure? 
It was so decided. 

The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the 

rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  the 
election shall be held by secret ballot. 
Before we begin the voting process, I should like 

to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the 
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no 
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a 
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting. 

I  should  like  to  seek  the  usual  cooperation  of 
representatives  during  the  time  of  the  conduct  of  the 
election.  Please  be  reminded  that,  during  the  voting 
process,  all  campaigning  should  cease  in  the  General 
Assembly Hall. That means in particular that, once the 
meeting has begun, no more campaign material can be 
distributed inside the Hall. 
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to

candidates  whose  names  appear  on  the  ballot  papers,
