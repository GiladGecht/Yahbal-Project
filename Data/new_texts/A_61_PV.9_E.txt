“We have now reached the end of the High-
level  Meeting  on  the  midterm  comprehensive 
global review of the Programme of Action for the 
least  developed  countries  for  the  decade  2001-
2010. 

“In  line  with  our  commitments,  and  in 
response  to  the  challenges  of  today’s  world,  we 
have  combined  our  efforts  and  worked  in  a 
responsible  and  proactive  manner  to  carry  out  a 
rigorous  analysis  of  the  implementation  of  the 
Brussels Programme of Action. 

“We  have  also,  most  importantly,  together 
charted  the  course  for  the  next  five  years  by

effectively  reaching  the  goals  set  out  in  the

for  their  efforts.  Such  hard  work  was  only  to  be 
expected, as our debate will influence the fate of 
millions  of  people  — 
the  most  vulnerable 
segment of the international community. 

“I would also like to welcome the adoption 
of the Declaration, a fitting outcome to our work, 
which  reflects  a  balanced  consensus  and  will 
provide  us  with  guidance  as  we  continue  the 
implementation  of  the  Brussels  Programme  of 
Action over the next five years.

The President (spoke in Arabic): We are coming 

to  the  end  of  the  High-level  Meeting  of  the  General 
Assembly  on 
the  midterm  comprehensive  global 
review  of  the  implementation  of  the  Programme  of 
Action  for  the  Least  Developed  Countries  for  the 
Decade 2001-2010. 

This  meeting  has  enabled  us  to  provide  the 
international  community  with  information  about  the 
progress  made  towards  achieving  the  Programme’s 
goals and overcoming the challenges that it has faced. 
The review process has been extensive. We have 

conducted 
international 
consultations,  culminating  in  this  High-level  Meeting. 
Through 
that  comprehensive  review  process,  we 
issues 
generated  a  deeper  understanding  of 
the 
involved  and  reaffirmed  our  commitment 
to 
the 
Brussels Declaration and Programme of Action.  

The  Declaration  that  we  have  adopted  today 
reaffirms  our  commitment  to  combating  poverty.  We 
are  optimistic  about  the  commitment  of  all  parties, 
civil  society,  non-governmental  organizations  and  the 
private  sector 
to  strengthen 
partnerships that allow the international community to 
act more effectively with a view to achieving the seven 
commitments set out in the Programme of Action. 

The  challenges  before  us  remain  daunting,  and 
time  is  of  the  essence.  As  the  Declaration  states,  if 
current  trends  continue,  most  of  the  least  developed 
countries will be able to achieve neither the objectives 
of  the  Programme  of  Action  nor  the  Millennium 
Development Goals. 

I  therefore  call  upon  all  members  to  rise  to  the 
challenge  and  to  redouble  their  collective  efforts  to
