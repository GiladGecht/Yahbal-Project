two-hundredth  anniversary  of 

Let  me  take  this  opportunity  to  commend  the 
General Assembly’s adoption of the historic resolution 
61/19,  on 
the 
abolition  of  the  trans-Atlantic  slave  trade  and  on  the 
commemoration  of  the  International  Day  held  on 
25 March  of  this  year.  The  Bahamas,  where  the 
majority of our people are proud descendents of freed 
slaves,  is  participating  at  both  the  national  and  the 
regional 
in  a  number  of  commemorative 
activities.  We  fully  support  the  project  aimed  at 
erecting a permanent memorial at the United Nations in 
commemoration of that shameful period in the history 
of our world. 

At  a  time  when  the  international  community  is 
engaged in serious reflections regarding the history and 
consequences  of  slavery  and  the  slave  trade,  the 
Bahamas wishes to recognize Haiti as the only country 
to  liberate  itself  from  slavery  and  for  the  inspiration 
this  provided  to  the  international  campaign  against 
slavery. 

Since  modern  forms  of  slavery  still  exist  and 
since many people continue to be held in servitude, we 
must not relent in our resolve until everyone is able to 
enjoy 
this 
Organization  has  worked  so  diligently  to  recognize, 
uphold and defend. 

Despite  Haiti’s  proud  history,  challenges  have 
beset  our  neighbour  for  generations.  Haiti’s  return  to 
democratic  order  last  year  was  especially  welcomed, 
and we celebrate the strides Haiti is making along the 
difficult  and  arduous  road  to  peace,  security  and 
freedoms  which

  General debate 

The President: I give the floor to His Excellency 

Mr.  Brent  Symonette,  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and 
Minister  for  Foreign Affairs  of  the  Commonwealth  of 
the Bahamas. 
Mr. Symonette (Bahamas): I am proud to address 

this  body  as  the  representative  of  the  Government  of 
the Bahamas. We are committed to achieving a sense of 
security,  well-being,  pride  and  prosperity  for  the 
people  of  the  Bahamas.  We  look  forward  to  working 
with fellow Member States towards securing the same 
opportunities and freedoms for all people. 

On  behalf  of  the  Government  and  the  people  of 
the  Commonwealth  of  the  Bahamas,  I  congratulate 
you,  Sir,  on  your  election  as  President  of  the  General 
Assembly  at  its  sixty-second  session.  I  also  want  to 
take this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor 
for  her  leadership  and  dedication  and  for  so  aptly 
guiding the work of the sixty-first session. 

I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  extend 
congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on 
his appointment as the eighth Secretary-General of the 
Organization. My Government is confident that, given 
Secretary-General  Ban’s  experience  and  diplomatic 
skills, he will aptly guide the Organization in facing its 
challenges.

development.  We  heartily  commend  President  Préval 
and  his  Administration  for  their  stewardship  of  this 
demanding  process.  At 
time,  we  also 
commend  the  Organization  of American  States  for  its 
unstinting support for the people of Haiti. 

The United Nations Mission in Haiti continues to 
play  a  vital  role  in  this  process,  and  the  Bahamas 
supports the call for that mission to be maintained so as 
to  consolidate  the  gains  made  to  date  and  thus  place 
our Caribbean Community (CARICOM) sister country 
on a firm and lasting path to sustainable development, 
peace, 
the 
international community to support the people of Haiti 
in that quest. 

As  Haiti  lies  merely  90  miles  from  the  southern 
shores  of  the  Bahamas,  its  economic  and  political 
situation can and does have very tangible repercussions 
for us all. Each year, the Bahamas is challenged by the 
arrival of thousands of illegal migrants from Haiti who, 
by perilous means, journey to our shores in search of a 
better way of life. Ensuring that justice and democracy 
prevail  in  Haiti,  therefore,  has  a  positive  impact  not 
only  on  the  people  of  Haiti,  but  also  on  the  Bahamas 
and indeed the entire region. 

The  role  of  the  United  Nations  in  matters  of 
sustainable  development  is  crucial,  particularly  with 
regard 
truly  global 
response —  challenges  such  as  climate  change.  We 
commend  the  Secretary-General  for  bringing  greater 
focus to the issue, with the convening of the high-level 
event on climate change last week, and are hopeful that 
the event will provide the necessary impetus for action 
when  Member  States  meet  in  Bali  later  this  year. The 
Conference  of  the  Parties  to  the  United  Nations 
Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  is  indeed 
the appropriate forum for negotiations on a post-Kyoto 
agreement,  and  the  political  will  demonstrated  during 
the  Secretary-General’s  recent  high-level  event  should 
only  bring  closer  focus  to  an  agreed  agenda  in  that 
regard. 

and 
archipelagos  like  the  Bahamas,  climate  change  is  a 
matter of critical importance. For many of us it is not 
just a matter of economics, but a matter of survival, as 
80 per cent of our landmass is within five feet of mean 
sea  level;  even  a  one-degree  rise  in  atmospheric 
temperature  can  have  devastating  ecological  effects. 
Climate change is particularly challenging with respect 
to  challenges  demanding  a

to the potential effects on  our tourism industry, which 
is our main industry and which generates some 60 per 
cent  of  the  Bahamas’s  gross  domestic  product.  We 
therefore  cannot  overemphasize 
the  need  for  an 
ambitious  mitigation  agenda 
the  post-Kyoto 
regime. Recent studies have shown that there are many 
mitigation  options  available,  and  many  of  them  are 
win-win.  We  must 
therefore,  with  unwavering 
commitment,  explore  these  options  in  an  open  and 
inclusive environment. 

For  countries  like  the  Bahamas,  resources  for 
adaptation  are  also  essential.  However,  even  access  to 
existing  funds  can  prove  difficult  given  the  country’s 
gross  national  income.  It  is  therefore  vital  that  the 
relevant financial instruments and mechanisms be fully 
operationalized  and/or  improved  so  that  they  become 
more  accessible  and  better  address 
the  peculiar 
circumstances and special needs of different countries. 
Further,  there  is  a  need  for  greater  international 
cooperation  with  respect  to  the  development  of  new 
technologies,  as  well  as 
transfer  of  such 
technologies in support of the sustainable development 
of small island developing States. 

We in the Caribbean region must prepare for the 
possibility  of  continued  increases  in  the  incidence  of 
natural  hazards  such  as  hurricanes, 
floods  and 
earthquakes.  Whether  it  is  through  assistance  with 
hazard  mapping 
assessment 
standardization or through the implementation of early 
warning  systems,  international  cooperation  has  an 
important  role  to  play  in  complementing  national 
efforts to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters. 

One  step  taken  by  the  Caribbean  region  was  the 
establishment  of  the  Caribbean  Catastrophic  Risk 
Insurance  Facility  under  the  aegis  of  the World  Bank. 
We  would  like  to  thank  those  countries  who  have 
contributed  to  the  fund.  The  Bahamas  continues  to 
press for the execution of the Mauritius Strategy for the 
Further  Implementation  of  the  Programme  of  Action 
for  the  Sustainable  Development  of  Small  Island 
Developing  States,  as  well  as  of  complementary 
frameworks  such  as 
the  Johannesburg  Plan  of 
Implementation and the Hyogo Framework for Action. 
The time has come to reassess our collective response 
to  these  issues  and  to  renew  our  efforts  in  support  of 
sustainable development.

especially  important  to  the  Bahamas.  There  is  a 
definite need for concrete, realistic proposals to ensure 
the  effective,  permanent  representation  of  developing 
countries,  particularly  small  developing  countries,  not 
only  in  the  Bretton  Woods  institutions  and  the  WTO 
but  also  in  the  other  international  economic  and 
financial  institutions,  such  as  the  Financial  Stability 
Forum, the Financial Action Task Force and the Basel 
Committee. 
The Bahamas welcomes the positive development 

in the area of international cooperation in tax matters, 
namely, the establishment of the Committee of Experts 
on International Cooperation in Tax Matters within the 
Economic  and  Social  Council.  The  establishment  of 
that  Committee  ensures  that  the  interests  of  small 
developing States Members of the United Nations with 
different  tax  regimes  will  be factored  into  discussions

Last  year  the  United  Nations  Global  Counter-
Terrorism  Strategy  (resolution  60/288)  was  adopted, 
marking an important step towards the elaboration of a 
counter-terrorism  convention.  The  Bahamas  continues 
to  condemn  terrorism  and  recognizes  that  while  there 
may  be 
terrorism  and  criminal 
activities  converge, the methodologies used to combat 
each of them are very different. Based on its own risk 
assessment, 
each  Government  must 
determine  the  level  of  resources  that  can  be  adopted 
and applied to counter-terrorism measures, particularly 
given  the  emphasis  that  the  Strategy  also  places  on 
addressing and preventing the conditions conducive to 
the spread of terrorism. 

In  prescribing  counter-terrorism  measures,  care 
must  be  taken  by  the  international  community  to 
preserve  the  tenet  of  due  process.  Care  must  also  be 
taken to guard against the creation of disincentives that

Needless  to  say,  such  initiatives  present  a  challenge 
and divert resources from our economic development. 
The  Bahamas  reaffirms  its  commitment  to  fulfil 

its obligations to major international drug and counter-
terrorism  conventions  and  continues  to  support  the 
concept  of  the  expansion  of  the  membership  of  the 
Security  Council.  The  Bahamas  maintains,  however, 
that  such  expansion  of  the  Security  Council  will  not

While it is incumbent on Member States to fulfil

Organization  must  put  in  place  effective  management 
tools  and  create  a  system 
that  would  eliminate 
overspending  and  waste  and  create  more  fiscal 
accountability and proper oversight. 

The  Bahamas  values  the  role  of  the  United 
Nations as the custodian of the interests of the world’s 
people,  in  particular  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable. The 
Bahamas  continues  to  believe  that  the  United  Nations 
Charter  constitutes  a  viable  and  firm  foundation  on 
which  the  Organization  can  balance  and  achieve  its 
objectives: to maintain international peace and security

Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Jamaica. 
Mr. Baugh (Jamaica): It is my great pleasure, Sir, 

sincere 
to  extend 
congratulations  on  your  assumption  of  the  presidency 
of  the  General  Assembly.  The  Jamaican  delegation  is 
confident  that  much  will  be  accomplished  during  the 
sixty-second  session  under  your  able  leadership.  You 
can  be  assured  of 
the  Jamaican 
delegation in that endeavour. 

To  your  predecessor,  Her  Excellency  Sheikha 
Haya  Rashed  Al-Khalifa,  the  Jamaican  delegation 
extends  its  appreciation  for  her  unstinting  efforts  in 
advancing the work of the General Assembly during its 
sixty-first session. 

Jamaica also wishes to pay tribute to the laudable 
efforts  of  Secretary-General  Ban  Ki-moon  who,  since 
his  assumption  of  office  in  January  of  this  year,  has 
moved  forward  in  earnest  to  enhance  the  process  of 
reform of the United Nations. 

I  am  deeply  honoured  to  be  addressing  the 
General Assembly at its sixty-second session on behalf 
of my country, Jamaica. The time has come to reassess 
our collective response to these issues and to renew our 
efforts in support of sustainable development.

Charter  constitutes  a  viable  and  firm  foundation  on 
which  the  Organization  can  balance  and  achieve  its 
objectives: to maintain international peace and security 
and,  equally  important,  to  promote  development  and 
economic and social progress. 
The  President:  I  now  call  on  His  Excellency 

Mr. Kenneth  Baugh,  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and 
Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Jamaica. 
Mr. Baugh (Jamaica): It is my great pleasure, Sir, 

to  extend 
sincere 
congratulations  on  your  assumption  of  the  presidency 
of  the  General  Assembly.  The  Jamaican  delegation  is 
confident  that  much  will  be  accomplished  during  the 
sixty-second  session  under  your  able  leadership.  You 
can  be  assured  of 
the  Jamaican 
delegation in that endeavour. 
to  you  warmest  and  most 
the  support  of 


To  your  predecessor,  Her  Excellency  Sheikha 
Haya  Rashed  Al-Khalifa,  the  Jamaican  delegation 
extends  its  appreciation  for  her  unstinting  efforts  in 
advancing the work of the General Assembly during its 
sixty-first session. 

Jamaica also wishes to pay tribute to the laudable 
efforts  of  Secretary-General  Ban  Ki-moon  who,  since 
his  assumption  of  office  in  January  of  this  year,  has 
moved  forward  in  earnest  to  enhance  the  process  of 
reform of the United Nations. 
I  am  deeply  honoured  to  be  addressing  the 

General Assembly at its sixty-second session on behalf 
of my country, Jamaica. Today, I especially restate my 
country’s firm commitment to the ideals and principles 
of the United Nations and underscore Jamaica’s strong 
support  for  multilateralism,  which  must  underpin  the 
core  processes  in  the  execution  of  the  functions  and 
responsibilities  of  the  United  Nations.  In  doing  so,  I 
am driven by our resolve for change, as well as by the 
need for unity and for the reinvigoration of the United 
Nations  in  order  for  it  to  effectively  and  efficiently 
achieve the fundamental purposes set out in its Charter.  

As we begin this session, we must not lose sight 
of  our  strategic  objectives  and  vision  towards  the 
maintenance  of  international  peace  and  security;  the 
development  of  friendly  relations  among  nations;  the 
achievement  of 
the 
economic, social, cultural and humanitarian fields; and 
the  promotion  of  human  rights  and  fundamental 
freedoms.  
Looking back at the  record over the past year, it 

is  disconcerting  that  the  challenges  we  face  at  the 
global  level  have  not  seen  much  discernable  change. 
From  a  security  point  of  view,  the  world  continues  to 
be  plagued  by  seemingly  incessant  and  protracted 
conflicts,  such  as  those  in  the  Middle  East,  parts  of 
Africa and elsewhere. Millions of innocent persons are 
the victims of civil strife or are displaced as a result of 
violence  and  armed  conflict.  Terrorism,  transnational 
organized  crime  and  the  proliferation  of  weapons  of 
mass  destruction  continue  to  threaten  international 
peace and security.  
From  the  economic  and  social  perspective,  we 

cannot  escape  the  fact  that  we  live  in  a  world 
characterized  by  high  levels  of  underdevelopment  and 
social  degradation  —  a  world  where  too  many  people 
live  in  dehumanizing  poverty.  It  is  a  world  in  which 
human  security  is  being  threatened  by  environmental 
international  cooperation 
in

Unquestionably, 


degradation.  The  experience  of  HIV/AIDS  and  the 
constant  threat  of  new  pandemics  underscore  our 
interconnectedness  and  interdependence,  demanding 
universal cooperation and collective action.  

All  States,  developed  and  developing,  large  and 
small,  are  vulnerable  to  those  threats  and  must  of 
necessity  have  a  shared  commitment  to  strengthening 
collective  security  and  safeguarding  world  peace  and 
security.  No  nation  can  address  those  challenges  and 
threats entirely on its own. Sustained collective action 
and  global  cooperation  are  required  to  identify  and 
shape  a  common  vision  and  agreed  objectives  to  deal 
with the complexities of our times. In recent years, we 
have renewed our commitment to the United Nations as 
the  catalyst  for  effectively  advancing  the  interests  of 
our  peoples  in  the  areas  of  development,  peace  and 
security, and human rights.  

there  have  been  pockets  of 
success  in  global  economic  progress  over  the  past 
decade. By and large, however, our commitments have 
not been matched by the desired implementation of the 
targets for meeting basic human needs, human security 
and  sustainable  development.  It  is  clear  that  much 
more  needs  to  be  done  if  we  are  to  achieve  the 
development  targets  in  the  Millennium  Development 
Goals (MDGs) by 2015.  

The  Government  of  Jamaica  fully  accepts  that 
each country has the primary responsibility for setting 
development  priorities  through  sound  governance  and 
policies. We  believe that the goals that  were solemnly 
agreed  seven  years  ago  are  not  overly  ambitious  and 
are still achievable. In that context, my Government is 
committed  to  taking  further  measures  to  pursue  the 
objectives  of  the  MDGs  and  other  internationally 
agreed  development  goals.  We  are  committed  to 
providing  the  necessary  framework  that  will  promote 
social  inclusion,  enhance  productive  capacity  and 
employment,  and  facilitate  investment  and  sustained 
economic growth.  

But many developing countries, such as Jamaica, 
cannot do it alone. The realization of the development 
agenda  is  dependent  not  only  on  our  own  domestic 
capabilities, but equally on the genuine commitment of 
all  Member  States  to  pursue  a  global  partnership  for 
development,  which  is  at  the  core  of  the  strategy  for 
development.  We  believe, 
is 
imperative that we move beyond the simple reiteration 
of  principles  and  translate  commitments  into  action.

We  must  give  life  to  the  aspirations  embodied  in  the 
outcomes  of  international  conferences  on  the  basis  of 
mutual responsibility and mutual accountability, with a 
fair  expectation  that  obligations,  as  agreed,  will  be 
fully undertaken.  

In all that we do, we must recognize that progress 
and  uplifting  the  poor  benefits  all  of  us.  It  can  mean 
the  difference  between  conflict  and  stability,  between 
hope and despair. As developing countries strive to put 
in  place  practical  national  development  strategies, 
developed  country  partners  must  support  those  efforts 
through  greater  market  access,  debt  relief,  private 
capital  flows,  technological  transfers  and  improved 
global  economic  governance.  Jamaica  therefore  calls 
for  renewed  focus,  as  well  as  the  necessary  political 
will, 
for 
development,  and  urges 
fulfilment  of  all 
obligations that we have collectively embraced so that 
we  may  effect  real  change  in  the  lives  of  millions  of 
impoverished people around the world.

developed  countries  of 
the  official  development

Development  provides  an  opportunity 
to  enhance 
collaboration  with our  partners towards  achieving that 
goal.  

of  middle-income 
developing  countries,  such  as  Jamaica,  also  requires 
special  attention. That  varied  group  of  countries,  with 
per capita gross domestic product spreading from $900 
to $10,000, is by no means a homogeneous group and 
possesses  its  own  particular  vulnerabilities.  Greater 
efforts  must  be  made  to  address  the  needs  of  middle-
income  developing  countries,  in  particular  the  high 
level of indebtedness that those countries face.  

Globalization  and  economic  liberalization  have 
resulted  in  the  increased  exposure  of  developing 
countries to external economic forces over which they 
have  little  control.  We  should  refuse  to  accept  that 
globalization  creates  winners  and  losers.  What  we 
should strive for is a win-win and inclusive process in 
which  the  benefits  and  opportunities  are  more  widely 
enjoyed across countries and regions.

integration in the world economy. A continued cause of 
grave  concern  to  Jamaica  is  therefore  the  current 
impasse  in  the  negotiations  in  the  Doha  Development 
Round, in spite of commitments to work expeditiously 
towards  implementing  the  development  dimensions  of 
the  Doha  work  programme.  We  must  summon  the 
necessary  political  will  to  reignite  trade  negotiations, 
with the development agenda as the centrepiece of the 
discussions  as  we  seek 
integrate  developing 
countries in the multilateral trading system.  

It  is  important  that  the  creation  of  a  viable  and 
equitable  trade  regime  also  recognize  diversity  in  the 
levels  of  development  and  size  of  economies. A  one-
size-fits-all  model  disregards  the  complexities  and 
unique  circumstances  of  countries.  Jamaica  will 
therefore  continue 
trading 
arrangements  take  account  of  that  differentiation, 
especially  as  it  concerns  small  vulnerable  economies. 
The  principle  of  special  and  differential  treatment 
seeks  only  to  level  the  playing  field  and  to  give 
developing  countries  a  fair  chance  to  participate 
meaningfully in global trade. At the same time, we will 
also join other developing countries in pressing for the 
removal of support for agricultural products by certain 
developed  countries  as  a  precondition  for  further 
market access for such products.  
We call for and join in continuous and concerted

communicable 
including  HIV/AIDS, 
tuberculosis, malaria and others, particularly bearing in 
mind  that  they  are  all  preventable.  The  global  impact 
of  AIDS  has  been  particularly  devastating.  The  high 
prevalence  in  many  countries,  especially  in  sub-
Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, is cause for alarm. It 
should be noted that the pattern of high prevalence and 
high  heterosexual  transmission  is  strongly  associated 
with poverty.  

While  noting  the  international  response  through 
the  Joint  United  Nations  Programme  on  HIV/AIDS 
(UNAIDS)  and  the  Global  Fund  to  Fight  AIDS, 
Tuberculosis  and  Malaria,  we  stress  the  need  for 
increased funding to help support developing countries 
to  fight  the  pandemic.  We  are  particularly  concerned 
that the countries of the Caribbean, including Jamaica, 
are placed at a disadvantage in accessing the necessary 
funding  to  curtail  the  spread  of  the  disease  owing  to 
their assigned middle-income status.

Implementing  a  global  response 

to  climate 
change must remain a priority as we seek consensus for 
combating  global  warming  beyond  2012,  when  the 
Kyoto  Protocol  expires.  As  we  prepare  for 
the 
Conference  of  the  Parties  to  the  United  Nations 
Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  in  Bali, 
Indonesia,  we  are  encouraged  that  the  recent  High-
Level  Event  on  Climate  Change  and  the  General 
Assembly 
change 
reinforced the urgency with which issues pertaining to 
environmental sustainability have to be tackled.  

The  principle  of  common  but  differentiated 
responsibility must be applied across the board. We are 
equally  convinced  that  the  international  community 
must  assist 
in 
incorporating climate change adaptation and mitigation 
concerns in national sustainable development plans and 
assist  them  by  improving  access  to  environmentally 
sound technology related to climate change.  

Jamaica and other countries in the Caribbean are 
all  too  familiar  with  the  adverse  effects  of  climate 
change and associated phenomena, including the rise in 
sea-level  and  the  increase  in  the  frequency  and 
intensity  of  hurricanes  and  other  weather  events  that 
threaten  the  sustainable  development,  livelihoods  and 
the very existence of small island developing States. In 
my  own  country,  the  onslaught  of  Hurricane  Dean  on 
19  August  resulted  in  the  loss  of  life  and  extensive 
damage to infrastructure, property and the agricultural 
sector, as well as in the loss of livelihood for many.  

The threat of terrorism transcends boundaries and 
has  had  a  devastating 
the  economic 
development of States, whether directly or indirectly. It 
is 
that  we  negotiate  and  conclude  a 
comprehensive  convention  against  terrorism. We  must 
also 
invigorate  disarmament  and  non-proliferation 
efforts.  

There  is  a  need  to  comprehensively  address  the 
illicit  trafficking  in  small  arms  and  light  weapons, 
which have the capacity to kill and maim thousands of 
people.  Jamaica  has  first-hand  experience  of  high 
levels  of  gun  violence  and  the  unwarranted  burden  it 
places on our social and economic system. We urge the 
international  community  to  give  priority  attention  to 
this menace, including through the creation of a legally 
binding  instrument  containing  stricter  controls  on  the 
illegal trade in small arms  and ammunition. Likewise,

arms trade treaty.  

A major priority of the United Nations is not only 
winning  the  peace,  but  more  importantly  keeping  and 
sustaining  the  peace.  Jamaica  fully  supports  the  work 
of  the  Peacebuilding  Commission,  which  earlier  this 
year  celebrated 
its  first  anniversary  and  whose 
groundbreaking  work 
in  post-conflict 
rehabilitation  and  reconstruction. As  a  member  of  the 
Commission,

and reconstruction process.

continues  to  be  seized  of  developments  in  Haiti.  We 
reaffirm  the  importance  of  the  continued  engagement 
of  the  international  community  and,  in  this  regard, 
welcome  the  renewal  of  the  mandate  of  the  United 
Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) to 
assist  in  the  stabilization  process.  We  also  encourage 
support  from  the  international  community  to  meet  the 
long-term  social,  economic  and  development  needs  of 
Haiti.  

We  must  remain  unwavering  in  our  commitment 
to  the  promotion  and  protection  of  human  rights  and 
the rule of law. Much more needs to be done to ensure 
that  the  basic  rights  of  individuals  are  universally 
protected  and 
transparent  and  accountable 
governance  prevails  at  the  local  and  international 
levels.  

Jamaica is honoured to assume the Chairmanship 
of  the  Third  Committee  during  the  General Assembly 
at its sixty-second session, as part of our commitment 
to ensure that human rights are promoted and protected 
globally. In this regard, we are particularly keen to help 
guide 
in  promoting  and 
protecting  the  rights  of  marginalized  and  vulnerable 
groups.  Jamaica  recognizes  the  importance  of  the 
protection  of  the  human  rights  of  women,  which  is

therefore  welcomes  the  recent  unanimous  adoption  of

the 
deployment of the joint African Union-United Nations 
Hybrid  Operation  in  Darfur  to  the  region.  We  are 
encouraged  that  by  certain  developments  that  indicate 
that  this  kind  of  cooperation  has  begun  and  urge  that

the 
fundamental tools and the required level of expertise to 
effectively  address  the  major  challenges  facing  us 
today. It is now clear that we must also have a steadfast 
will and a shared commitment towards a radical change 
from the existing mindset in favour of positive action, 
if  the  United  Nations  is  to  successfully  respond  to 
challenges, which continue to hamper the attainment of 
its objectives for peace and sustainable development.  

In  calling  for  radical  change  in  the  existing 
mindset and in the way we discourse and take actions 
on  international  issues,  we  should  be  guided  by  the 
purposes and principles of the Charter. A change in our 
mindset  will  require  a  rethinking  on  the  part  of  all 
Member States as we seek to promote world peace and 
achieve economic and social development. It will also 
require a deep search in the conscience of all States as 
we 
to  our  obligations  under 
international law with due regard for the collective will 
of the international community.  

This  radical  change  in  the  existing  mindset  will 
necessarily  require  us  to  be  more  responsible  as 
Member  States  of  a  united  Organization,  more 
responsible  as  citizens  of  this  one  world  and  more 
focused  on  the  shared  responsibilities  that  come  with 
our membership in the United Nations.  

Let  us  not  falter  in  our  obligation  to  ensure  that 
the  Organization  not  only  remains  responsive  to  the 
vast  array  of  concerns  and  demands  of  its  diverse 
membership,  but  that  it  is  able  to  do  so  without 
compromising the noble ideals and principles on which 
it was founded.  This  process  begins  with  a  conscious 
determination  and  political  resolve  to  transform  not 
only our modus operandi, but the thinking that informs 
it.  Jamaica  stands  ready  to  play  its  part  in  this 
endeavour  and  calls  upon  all  Member  States  to  do 
likewise.  
The President: I now call on His Excellency Mr. 

Ahmad  Allam-Mi,  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs  and 
African Integration of the Republic of Chad.  
Mr. Allam-Mi  (Chad)  (spoke  in  French):  Please 

accept  our  warm  congratulations,  Sir,  on  your  well-
deserved  election  to  the  presidency  of  our  Assembly. 
We  are  convinced  that  you  possess  all  the  necessary 
qualities  for  the  sound  direction  of  our  work.  My 
country assures you of its support as you carry out your 
important task.  

We  also  wish  to  convey  our  gratitude  to  your 
predecessor,  Sheikha  Haya  Rashed Al-Khalifa,  for  the 
efficiency  with  which  she  guided  the  work  of  our 
sixty-first  session.  I  also  wish  to  pay  a  well-deserved 
tribute 
to  our  Secretary-General,  His  Excellency 
Mr. Ban  Ki-moon,  who  has  been  constantly  playing  a 
significant  role  since  his  election  in  advancing  the 
ideals of our Organization.  

One  important  event  has  caught  the  attention  of 
Chad. On 25 September, the Security Council adopted 
unanimously  resolution  1778  (2007)  authorizing  an 
international  operation  on  the  eastern  border  of  Chad 
and  the  north-east  border  of  the  Central  African 
Republic.  That  operation  —  and  we  should  stress  the 
defensive  nature  of  its  mandate:  the  protection  of 
refugees,  displaced  persons,  civilian  populations  and 
humanitarian workers — is something that in Chad we 
are very satisfied to see since it will lighten the heavy 
burden borne thus far by the Chadian local police since 
the beginning of the crisis in Darfur.  

Chad  also  wishes  to  thank  the  Office  of  the 
United  Nations  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees  and 
the  friendly  countries  who  have  supported  the  local 
Chadian police. At this point, I wish also to pay tribute 
to  their  courage  and  dedication  because  they  did  their 
best 
their  sensitive  and 
dangerous mission.  

The  new  operation  will  be  able  to  rely  on  the 
availability and cooperation of Chadian authorities. We 
venture  to  hope  that  it  will  stabilize  and  create 
conditions for the reconstruction of the eastern part of 
our country, which has been destroyed by incursions of 
the Janjaweed militias from the Sudan and other armed 
groups from Darfur. It will also especially require that 
the  Chadian  displaced  persons,  who  have  so  far  been 
neglected  by 
community,  be 
reinstalled in their original localities.  

Above and beyond our hopes of stabilization and 
reconstruction  in  the  eastern  part  of  our  country,  we 
have the legitimate hope that the Darfur crisis will end. 
More  than  any  country,  Chad  would  gain  by  that, 
especially  since  our  populations  in  the  eastern  part  of 
Chad have been the victims of the crisis as often if not 
more  than  our  sister  populations  of  the  Sudan  in 
Darfur.  For  that  reason,  our  country  has  tirelessly 
endeavoured to restore peace and security to Darfur. In 
that regard, no one can ignore the extremely important 
role  played  by  the  President  of  the  Republic,  His 
to  accomplish

10 

07-52434 


Excellency  Mr.  Idriss  Deby  Itmo,  in  supporting  the 
peacekeeping  measures  taken  by  the  international 
community.  

The  Republic  of  Chad  has  no  intention  of 
departing  from  that  course.  For  that  reason  we  will 
make the fullest possible contribution to the success of 
the resumed inter-Sudanese peace talks on Darfur that 
are scheduled for Tripoli on 27 October. We have also 
contributed  to  the  preparation  of  the  peace  talks 
through our participation in meetings bringing together 
the  non-signatory  movements  of  the  Abuja  Peace 
Agreement,  including  meetings  at Abeche  in  Chad,  at 
Asmara  in  Eritrea,  at  Tripoli  in  the  Libyan  Arab 
Jamahiriya  and  at  Arusha  in  Tanzania,  as  well  as  the 
last Seminar of N’Djaména in Chad — all of which has 
taken place under the auspices of the joint mediation of 
the United Nations and the African Union.  

We have just underscored our resolve to work for 
peace  in  Darfur  in  particular,  and  of  course,  in  the 
Sudan in general, because that work is in the interest of 
peace and security in the subregion of Central Africa in 
general  and  of  Chad  in  particular.  We  all  need  peace 
among our neighbours in order to fend off any risk to 
the  stabilization  of  our  countries  and  to  continue, 
guided by the inspiration of His Excellency Mr. Idriss 
Deby  Itmo,  President  of  the  Republic  and  Head  of 
State,  to  build  upon  the  democratic  process  that  our 
country  has  been  committed  to  since  1990,  as  well  as 
to  ensure  the  peace,  security  and  social  well-being  of 
the Chadian people.  

In that regard, we should highlight that, since last 
year, Chadian political life has witnessed some positive 
developments. A number of military and political high 
officials  of  the  Chadian  rebellion  have  had  their  legal 
rights restored, individually or in small groups or with 
their entire organization.  

On 4 March 2007, a new Government was formed 
under the leadership of one of the well known figures of 
the  political  opposition  to  the  presidential  majority  — 
Prime  Minister  Sem  Nouradine  Delwa  Kassire 
Koumakoye.  Moreover, 
the  new  Government  has 
responded  to  the  expectations  of  the  opposition  by 
deciding  to  postpone  the  legislative  and  communal 
elections  in  order  to  wait  for  the  conclusions  of  a 
political  dialogue  begun  under  the  auspices  of  the 
European  Union.  That  dialogue

that are acceptable to all actors in our political life, or 
at least by the greater majority, which is devoted to the 
peaceful  settlement  of  political  conflicts  and  has 
renounced  recourse to weapons and anti-constitutional 
changes.  

That  political  dialogue  led  to  the  signing  of  a 
political agreement on 13 August 2007. The signing of 
that 
the 
governmental  majority  and  the  democratic  opposition 
clearly stems from the constant resolve of the President 
of the Republic, His Excellency Mr. Idriss Deby Itmo, 
to establish a peaceful political life in the country.  
Furthermore,  we  wish  also  to  warmly  thank  our 

the  European 
development  partners, 
Union,  whose  valuable  assistance  enabled  us 
to 
produce  the  agreement  that  we  consider  historic. That 
new fact in Chad’s political life has enabled us to note 
with great satisfaction that a number of political exiles 
have  returned  or  intend  to  return  without  delay  to  the 
country. We owe that situation to the facilitation of the 
heads of State who are friends of Chad and we mention 
in  particular  His  Excellency  El  Hadj  Omar  Bongo 
Ondimba of Gabon and His Excellency Mr. Boni Yayi 
of  Benin.  In  addition  to  the  notable  progress  with  the 
democratic opposition and the Chadian political exiles 
we  note  that  we  are  looking  forward  —  with  the 
support  of  the  guide  to  the  Libyan  revolution  and  the 
mediator  of  the  Community  of  Sahelo-Saharan  States 
(CEN-SAD),  our  brother  Muammar  Al-Qadhafi  —  to 
continuing  with  the  useful  discussions  taking  place  in 
Tripoli  with  the  armed  movements  aimed  at  reaching 
agreements  with  those  organizations  that  have  not  yet 
rejoined the  great Chadian family. We hope that those 
movements will renounce any recourse to weapons and 
express 
the  peaceful 
framework set by the historic political agreement of 13 
August 2007 and with respect for the institutions of the 
Republic.  

It  is  our  view  that  all  political  initiatives  having 
to do with national reconciliation should fall within the 
framework of the political agreement of 13 August and 
should  contribute  to  strengthening  the  State  apparatus 
for  the  benefit  of  the  general  interest.  For  we  should 
not forget that since its independence, Chad has known 
only  conflict  or  post-conflict  situations,  often,  indeed, 
internal, but including in particular those fuelled from 
the  outside  to  weaken  the  State  or  to  topple  the 
country’s  institutions.  This  is  why  we  count  on  the 
international  community  to  unreservedly  condemn  all 
their  expectations  within

attempts  to  destabilize  the  Chadian  State,  and  also  all 
who use unconstitutional means, notably force, to seize 
power.  The  Chadian  people,  victims  of  insecurity  due 
to 
for  power, 
condemn  these  sterile  struggles  and  rely  on  the 
democratic  political  actors  and  on  the  international 
community to block the path to violence. 

If  we  must  extend  a  hand  to  the  rebels,  whose 
causes  sometimes  seem  to  be  from  the  world  of  a 
revolutionary  utopia,  this  should  not  be  done  to  the 
detriment of the highest interest of the rule of law and 
of democracy. Unhappiness is at the heart of rebellions. 
We  find  mercenaries  in  the  pay  of  someone  from  the 
exterior,  and  adventurers  who  use  it  as  a  source  of 
commerce  to  gain unwarranted material advantages or 
to  satisfy  personal  ambitions  in  exchange  for  their 
return  to  legality,  in  disdain  of  the  authority  of  the 
State  apparatus,  of  the  law  and  of  the  country’s 
regulations. 
After  this  brief  overview  of  Chadian  political 

questions,  allow  me 
issues 
regarding  today’s  challenges:  globalization  with  its 
hopes and anguishes, poverty, inequitable international 
trade,  terrorism,  the  AIDS  pandemic,  and  so  forth.  A 
number  of  international  meetings  have  been  held  on 
these 
and 
recommendations  have  been  adopted.  However,  no 
decisive  advances  have  been  made  in  these  areas.  We 
can  only  hope  that  the  international  community  will 
honour its commitments and that the richest will keep 
their promises vis-à-vis the poorest. 

We cannot simply ignore another important event, 
the  High-level  Event  on  Climate  Change  and  its 
consequences, which was held right here. We hope that 
the  international  community  will  learn  lessons  with  a 
view to acting instead of indulging in fine statements, 
as  was  the  case  after  the  United  Nations  Framework 
Convention on Climate Change in Kyoto. 

Yes,  we  need  to  act,  and  for  us  the  most  tragic 
case  deserving 
international 
community  is  that  of  the  shrinking  of  Lake  Chad, 
whose surface has been reduced in a few decades from 
25,000  square  kilometres  to  2,500  square  kilometres. 
Saving  Lake  Chad  would  not  only  contribute  to  the 
struggle  against  disastrous  climate  change  on  a 
planetary  level,  but  would  also  meet  the  needs  of 
25 million people in the countries adjacent to the Lake. 
and  on  others.  Resolutions

Another issue is just as worrisome, and that is the 
conflict  situations  in  Africa  and  on  other  continents. 
How  can  we  not  take  a  stand? We  applaud  the  efforts 
of  the African  Union  (AU)  and  the  United  Nations  to 
find  lasting  solutions  to  the  conflicts  in  Africa  or 
elsewhere in the world. 

This prompts us to underscore the importance of 
another event that has caught our attention. That is the 
Security Council meeting held at the level of heads of 
State  on  25  September  on  the  question  of  peace  and 
security  in  Africa.  We  are  mindful  of  the  Council’s 
steadily  growing  interest  in  Africa,  and  that  meeting 
seems  to  pave  the  way  for  the  strengthening  of 
cooperation  between  the  United  Nations  and  the  AU, 
especially with a view to building the capacities of the 
AU so that it can accomplish its peace missions in the 
best  possible  conditions.  This  is  the  moment  to 
condemn  the  recent  barbarous  attacks  on  the  African 
forces in Darfur and to express our condolences to the 
families of the missing. 

We have great hope for the settlement of all crises 
in the framework of the  rebirth of multilateralism  and 
collective  security,  which  our  Secretary-General  has 
very  strongly  endorsed:  hopes  for  peace  in  Côte 
d’Ivoire, 
the  Democratic 
Republic  of  the  Congo,  in  the  Horn  of  Africa,  in  the 
Middle East and so forth. 

Before I conclude, I would like to recall that we 
have  constantly  condemned  before  this  Assembly  all 
forms of violence and intolerance, especially their most 
extreme 
reaffirm  our 
condemnation  and  our  commitment  to  fighting  these 
phenomena. We would like to reaffirm our commitment 
to strive to eliminate all sources of conflicts and all the 
threats  that  jeopardize  peace  and  security  around  the 
world. 

In this regard, I wish to recall the need to respect 
the  principles  of  peaceful  coexistence,  which  are 
respect  for  the  sovereignty  and  the  territorial  integrity 
of  States.  This,  of  course,  prompts  us  to  reaffirm  our 
devotion  to  respect  for  internationally  recognized 
historical  borders.  We  cite  as  an  example  our 
attachment  to  the  policy  of  a  single  China  and  our 
opposition  to Taiwan’s  attempts  to  bring  about  a  kind 
of  accession  to  the  United  Nations,  under  whatever 
name they might choose. 
This  also  prompts  us  to  express  respect  for  the 

sovereign right of States to develop nuclear energy for

terrorism.  We

the  good 
arrangements  to  find  solutions  to  the  question  of 
nuclear  energy  through  negotiations  and  to  find  a 
peaceful  solution  to  the  problem  of  the  dissemination 
of weapons of mass destruction. 

This  last  prompts  us  once  again  to  launch  a 
pressing  appeal  to  our  Assembly,  especially  to  the 
permanent members of the Security Council, to redress 
the  injustice  of  the  African  continent  being  the  only 
continent that does not have a permanent member seat 
on the Council, when the bulk of the Council’s agenda 
is comprised of African situations. 
The  President:  I  now  give  the  floor  to  His 

Excellency  Mr.  Dermot  Ahern,  T.D.,  Minister  for 
Foreign Affairs of Ireland. 
Mr. Ahern  (Ireland):  First  of  all,  Mr.  President, 

may I congratulate you on your election and wish you 
well in the months ahead. 

Upon  its  formation  earlier  this  year,  the  Irish 
Government  set  itself  the  goal  of  becoming  a  model 
Member State of the this great Organization. We  have 
set out an ambitious programme to be a world leader in 
development assistance, rapid response to humanitarian 
disasters and conflict resolution. 

This is because our own history shows that there 
is  a  path  from  famine  to  plenty  and  from  conflict  to 
peace.  And 
a 
determination,  in  ordinary  Irish  men  and  women,  to 
stand  in  the  vanguard  of  the  fight  against  conflict, 
hunger  and  the  denial  of  human  rights,  a  fight  best 
fought  by  a  strong  and  equally  determined  United 
Nations — a fight we cannot afford to lose. 
It is also because after six decades, the core goal 

the  United  Nations  —  universal  peace  and 
of 
security — unfortunately still eludes us. Today, in spite 
of  all  our  efforts,  violent  conflict  remains  all  too 
common. 
The causes of conflict are many. But very often, it 

is  in  the  persistence  of  poverty  and  in  the  denial  of 
human  rights  that  we  find  the  causes  of  conflict,  the 
enduring  results  of  conflict  and  the  seeds  of  future 
conflict. In making peace, we must be as creative and 
as determined as those waging war.

high  in  terms  of  their  size,  scope  and  complexity. We 
must  also  support  strengthened  United  Nations  efforts

roving  ambassadors  to  affected  regions  and  an  annual 
fund of €25  million to assist conflict  resolution in the 
developing world. 

to 
strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  African  Union  and 
subregional organizations to make and build peace for 
themselves. We will focus our efforts on peacemaking 
during  conflict  and  peacebuilding  after  conflict.  We 
will also work on identifying, distilling and sharing the 
lessons  of  conflict  resolution.  We  will  be  particularly 
active  in  Africa,  including  through  working  with  our 
partner  Governments  under  our  Irish Aid  programme. 
We will explore the links between climate change and 
conflict, because climate change directly threatens not 
only the most vulnerable but all of our shared goals of 
progress, peace and development. 

The  focus  of  our  foreign  policy  on  rights, 
development  and  now  conflict  resolution  underlines 
once again Ireland’s commitment to the global agenda 
of  the  United  Nations.  But  this  convergence  is  also 
underscored  by  our  own  national  experience  of 
peacemaking.  Speaking  here  in  New  York  in  April 
1969,  before  the  appalling  escalation  of  violence  in 
Northern 
distinguished 
predecessors,  Frank  Aiken,  said  “I  think  there  is 
sufficient  wisdom  if  it  can  only  be  energized  in  our 
section  of  the  world,  in  these  islands  off  the  North 
West of Europe, to settle the problem.” For far too long 
that sufficient wisdom eluded us. 

For almost 40 years it has been my duty and that 
of  my  predecessors  as  Minister  for  Foreign Affairs  to 
brief  this  Assembly  on  the  search  for  peace  on  the 
island of  Ireland.  I  am particularly  delighted  to  report 
of  my

that perhaps, save for general updates on progress, this 
will no longer be necessary. 

The  conflict  in  Northern  Ireland  lasted  for  more 
than three decades and was made apparently insoluble 
by  issues  of  national,  cultural  and  religious  identity, 
contested  historical  narratives 
claims  of 
sovereignty,  all  hardened  by  the  direct  experiences  of 
division, inequality and violence. 

Since  the  ceasefires  of  the  mid-1990s  and  the 
negotiation  of  the  Good  Friday  Agreement  in  1998, 
there has been much better news to report. But the final 
steps  to  the  full  implementation  of  that  Agreement 
were  not  completed  until  earlier  this  year.  With  the 
formation  of 
the  power-sharing  Northern  Ireland 
Executive,  bringing  together  historic  opponents  from 
across 
the  political  divide,  we  have  opened  an 
extraordinary  new  chapter  in  the  history  of  the  island 
of Ireland. 
Legacies  of  separation  and  distrust  remain,  and 

the  inevitable  challenges  and  difficulties  of  normal 
politics will need wise and sensitive management. But 
there  is  an  overwhelming  consensus  that  this  new 
beginning can be nurtured and sustained. 

The  task  is  no  longer  to  find  peace,  but  to 
maintain  and  build  on  the  peace  we  have  found.  I  do 
not believe our success offers a universal, transferable 
formula, but I do believe that our experience of failure 
and  then  success  over  40  years  provides  insights  and 
lessons worth sharing. One of the specific tasks of our 
conflict resolution initiative is to codify those insights 
and lessons. But today I will offer just a few. 

First,  in  the  end,  those  who  are  part  of  the 
problem must be part of the solution — not because we 
approve of their actions or beliefs, but because without 
them it is all too easy for an agreement among others to 
be destroyed. 

Secondly, inclusive dialogue must, however, take 
place on the basis of clear and guaranteed principles. In 
Ireland, these were consent, non-violence and parity of 
esteem. 

Thirdly,  partnerships  between  Governments  and 
involving  sympathetic  third  parties  —  in  our  case  the 
United States and the European Union — can develop 
comprehensive  frameworks  within  which  enduring 
settlements can be reached.

Finally,  without 

Fourthly,  it  is  often  necessary  to  take  risks  for 
peace  —  but  those  risks  must  be  carefully  calibrated. 
Timing  is  of  the  essence  and  so  is  patience,  and  there 
are  times  when  contacts  must  be  private  and  at  arm’s 
length. 

Fifthly,  our  experience  demonstrates  the  need  to 
address  all  issues,  all  of  the  causes  of  conflict, 
comprehensively,  no  matter  how  difficult  and 
intractable  they  may  be,  and  even  if  they  have  to  be 
resolved in different time frames. 
Sixth,  popular  endorsement  of  an  agreement 

through  the  ballot  box  makes  it  immensely  more 
legitimate and durable. 

faithful 
implementation,  again  often  with  external  assistance, 
an agreement’s viability and credibility can quickly ebb 
away. 

On  a  more  practical  and  operational  level,  we 
have 
innovative 
arrangements  for  dealing  with  many  of  the  issues  that 
dominate  peacemaking  and  peacebuilding  in  our  case: 
constitutional  change,  power  sharing,  cross-border 
cooperation,  transitional  justice,  policing  and  security 
reform,  equality  and  human  rights,  conflict  over 
symbols, arms decommissioning and prisoner release. 

In our  own process, we have learned much from 
others,  particularly  from  the  instance  of  South Africa. 
Together,  I  hope  we  can,  in  Frank  Aiken’s  term, 
develop  both  sufficient  wisdom  and  sufficient  will  to 
resolve enduring and complex conflicts. 

Working with a strengthened United Nations and 
sharing  lessons  with  one  another,  I  passionately  hope 
we  can  advance  the  day  when  political  leaders  from 
other  regions  of  the  world  blighted  by  conflict  can 
announce  in  this  forum  that  peace  has  come  to  them 
too. 

Northern  Ireland  has  been  added  to  the  list  of 
conflicts  resolved.  But  the  road  to  universal  peace  is 
still blocked by conflicts old, new and threatened. 

Today, across the world we stand with the people 
of  Burma.  The  courage  of  the  Buddhist  monks  and 
nuns  and 
supporters  has  won  universal 
admiration.  The  efforts  of  its  regime  to  conceal  its 
brutality  behind  a  wall  of  silence  have  failed.  It  has 
been rightly condemned for its violent response. I call 
on its leaders at long last to respond  constructively to 
their 
14

the wishes of the people, to stop their violence and to 
release  Aung  San  Suu  Kyi  and  all  other  political 
prisoners.  The  process  of  national  reconciliation  and 
democratization  must  begin  in  earnest,  and  we  hope 
that the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy will be able 
to report progress on his return here in a few days. 

We  look  to  the  Security  Council  to  respond 
effectively  to  the  compelling  calls  of  the  international 
community. It is neither acceptable nor true to argue, as 
some of its members have, that the situation in Burma 
is  not  a  question  of  international  peace  and  security. 
The  potential  regional  consequences  of  the  crisis  are 
evident  to  all.  This  places  a  particular  onus  on  the 
Governments  of  China,  India  and  of  the  countries  of 
Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN).  I 
welcome  the  encouraging  recent  signs  of  positive  and 
concerned engagement and urge them to redouble their 
efforts. 

Within  the  European  Union,  Ireland  has  long 
taken  a  strong  and  principled  position  on  Burma.  We 
are looking urgently at how to increase the pressure on 
the  regime,  including  through  further  European  Union 
restrictive  measures,  without  harming  the  ordinary 
people, whose suffering is already so great. 

As  it  is  for  people  across  the  world,  Darfur  is  a 
matter of grave concern in Ireland. We have made it a

foundations  for  longer-term  peace  and  development. 
We  urge  the  full,  effective  and  speedy  deployment  of 
the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in 
Darfur.  Khartoum  must  actively  cooperate  and  at  last 
desist  from  all  obstruction.  Rebel  groups  must  also 
play  their  part.  The  recent  attack  on  peacekeepers  in 
Darfur  was  an  outrage  and  was  rightly  condemned 
here. I would like to express my sympathies and those 
of the Irish Government to the families of those killed.

Darfur crisis. 

All  those  who  are  party  to  the  conflict  must 
commit  to  the  political  talks  in  Libya  next  month.  I 
welcome  the  Secretary-General’s  establishment  of  a 
trust fund to support these talks, and I pledge Ireland’s

the  best  hope  for  progress  and  I  would  encourage  all 
those  involved  to  redouble  their  efforts  to  agree  on  a 
new political dispensation offering real political reform 
and economic recovery for all Zimbabweans. 

The  situation  in  the  Middle  East  is  always  high 
on  our  agenda.  There  has  been  a  collective 
international  failure  to  establish  a  credible  political 
process leading to a two-State solution. But today there 
are  possibilities  for  change.  The  outlines  of  a  viable 
settlement are clear to everyone, even if it will require 
difficult  and  painful  compromises.  Ireland  strongly 
supports  the  dialogue  between  Prime  Minister  Olmert 
and  President  Abbas.  We  are  also  encouraged  by  the 
determination of the Arab States to pursue the historic 
Arab  Peace  Initiative.  We  share  the  hope  that  the 
international  meeting  now

Secretary Rice’s leadership will indeed  be serious and

wishes  of  President  Michel  of 
the  Republic  of 
Seychelles, 
the  people  of 
Seychelles  on  the  convening  of  the  sixty-second 
session  of  the  General Assembly.  Seychelles  is  proud 
to be here today, as a partner and an ally, to further our 
international efforts, to address the challenges that are 
central  to  the  future  of  all  humanity  and  that  pose  a 
threat  to  global  political  and  economic  stability  and 
security. 
the  Government  and 
this  Organization, 
through 
and, 
I 
join  previous  speakers 

in  congratulating 
Mr. Srgjan  Kerim  on  his  election  to  the  presidency  of 
the  General Assembly  at  its  sixty-second  session.  His 
election to the helm of this Assembly is a testimony to 
the  high  esteem  in  which  the  international  community 
holds  him  and  his  country,  the  former  Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia. I take this opportunity, too, to 
express  my  country’s  sincere  appreciation  to  his 
predecessor,  Sheikha  Haya  Rashed  Al-Khalifa  of 
Bahrain, for her outstanding stewardship of the work of 
the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. 

Allow  me  to  commend  and  to  renew  Seychelles’ 
strong  support  to  Secretary-General  Ban  Ki-moon  for 
the  determination  and  strong  will  he  has  shown  since 
the  beginning  of  his  tenure  in  office,  in  strengthening 
the role of the United Nations. 

Seychelles  remains  unwavering  in  its  support  of 
the  United  Nations.  Our  commitment  has  not  changed 
since  we  joined  this  Organization  31  years  ago.  More 
than  ever,  we  believe  that  the  world  needs  strong  and 
effective  multilateralism.  Indeed,  we  are  convinced 
that  the  most  effective  means  of  advancing  our 
collective interests is through the United Nations. 

Seychelles  is  pleased  that  the  overarching  theme 
of this year’s session is responding to climate change, 
as  the  General Assembly  of  the  United  Nations  is  the 
forum  for  concerted  and  comprehensive  action  in 
addressing a defining issue of our time. 

Fifteen  years  ago,  in  1992,  Seychelles,  a  small 
island  developing  State,  was  the  second  country  to 
accede  to  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention 
on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC).  We  were  convinced 
then,  as  we  are  now,  that  the  Convention’s  primary 
objective  of  reducing  the  dangerous  levels  of  carbon 
dioxide  and  other  greenhouse  gases  in  the  earth’s 
atmosphere  must  be  realized  in  order  to  protect  the 
socio-economic 
environment 
disruptions.  Six  years 
in  1998,  Seychelles 
reiterated its commitment to the ideals of the UNFCCC 
by adopting the Kyoto Protocol. However, the attempts 
of 
those 
international agreements have been modest at best. 
The  challenge  of  development  has  never  been 

higher  on  the  international  agenda.  However,  the 
adverse  impacts  of  climate  change  are  a  major  barrier 
for  the  achievement  of  sustainable  development  goals 
in  many  countries,  especially  small  island  developing

States, which are recognized as being most vulnerable 
to climate change. 

We must emphasize again that for the majority of 
small  island  developing  States,  agriculture,  fisheries 
and tourism have for a long time been the mainstay of 
survival and  economic development. Let us not forget 
that  small  island  developing  States  are  home  to  a 
sizeable proportion of the world’s biodiversity and that 
the  majority  of 
the  species  are  endemic  and 
increasingly under threat because of climate change. 
In  Seychelles,  the  fisheries  sector  is  a  key  pillar 

of our economy. It is expected that changes in climate 
may  cause  migratory  shifts  in  tuna  aggregations  to 
other locations, thus depriving our country of one of its 
main  sources  of 
inshore  and 
traditional fishing, the mainstay of local fishermen and 
a major source of food, is also highly threatened. Food 
security on islands is at stake. 
The  impacts  of  climate  change  on  the  tourism 

sector  are  also  expected  to  be  significant,  and  that  is 
why  we  believe 
economic 
diversification 
revenue-generating 
sectors in small island States is more than necessary. 

Climate  change  is  also  a  security  issue.  But  it  is 
not  merely  a  matter  of  narrow  national  security  —  it 
has a new dimension. It is a question of our collective 
security and responsibility in a fragile and increasingly 
interdependent world, where the notion of borders has 
undergone a powerful symbolic transformation. 

It is now up to politicians, businessmen and civil 
society 
the  work  accomplished  by 
scientists.  The  peoples  of  the  world  are  increasingly 
looking to their leaders to take action, and the time is 
now.  A  week  ago,  at  a  meeting  of  the  Global  Island 
Partnership  in  Rome,  our  President,  James  Michel, 
launched the Sea Level Rise Foundation, as an attempt 
to ensure that island nations have the capacity to adapt 
to  climate  change.  Together  we  are  mobilizing 
leadership,  gathering  resources  and  sharing  skills, 
knowledge,  technologies  and  innovation  in  a  cost-
effective  and  sustainable  way  that  will  catalyse  action 
for conservation and sustainable livelihoods on islands 
and low-lying areas in the face of climate change.

We  believe 
the  reduction  of 
commitment in combating climate change. Aspirational 
global emissions reduction goals are not sufficient. We 
believe that the Kyoto Protocol paves the way forward 
for Annex I countries to fulfil their commitments under 
UNFCCC.  We  urge  those  parties  to  commit  to  their 
legally  binding  targets  and  to  translate  them  into 
concrete  actions  for 
their  gas 
emissions. 

a  United  Nations-based 
multilateral approach that builds on the Kyoto Protocol 
framework is the only decisive way of moving forward. 
There cannot be any doubt as to the major importance 
of  the  first  steps  taken  at  Kyoto  and  of  the  quantum 
improvements  brought  about  by  the  provisions  of  the 
Protocol. The size and urgency of the problem requires 
that we take bold initiatives and compromises. 

However, as the globe suffers because of climate 
change, it is essential that the international community 
as  a  whole  be  formally  and  unequivocally  reminded 
that  neither  the  efforts  made  thus  far  in  implementing 
UNFCCC,  nor  the  emissions  reduction  targets,  set  on 
average at 5.2 per cent, adopted in Kyoto represent an 
adequate 
gas 
concentrations  in  the  atmosphere  at  safe  levels.  We 
know that we need to do much more. In that regard, we 
would like to take this opportunity to praise the recent 
work accomplished by the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate  Change  in  urging  the  need  for  deeper  cuts  in 
greenhouse gasses of 25 per cent to 40 per cent below 
1990  levels  by  2020.  Moreover,  we  would  like  to 
extend our heartfelt appreciation for the determination 
shown  by  our  Secretary-General  in  facilitating  the 
international dialogue to address the problem.

that 
globalization  has  the  potential  to  advance  human 
development  throughout  the  world.  But  it  is  not 
automatic,  for  globalization  has  also  increased  our 
vulnerability, 
the  possibility  of 
marginalization. 

It  is  internationally  recognized  that  trade  can  be 
an  important  source  of  financing  for  development.  In 
this  particular  context,  Seychelles  strongly  believes 
that  more  emphasis  should  be  placed  on 
the 
development  dimension  of  small  island  developing 
States in multilateral trade negotiations, in recognition 
of 
structural  handicaps. 
Moreover,  in  our  view,  ownership  of  development 
orientations  by  recipient  countries  is  the  precondition 
for the emergence of a true partnership in development 
cooperation. 

Furthermore,  it  is  extremely  important  that  the 
whole  issue  of  development  policies  and  cooperation 
be  monitored  closely  within  the  international  system. 
Decisions  affecting  development  are  being  taken  in 
different  arenas,  forums  and  agencies.  Increasingly, 
there  is  the  need  to  ensure  coherence  in  policies  and 
programmes.  The  international  system  currently  does 
not  have  an  effective  mechanism  for  conducting  such 
an  exercise.  We  reiterate  our  belief  that  one  of  the 
urgent  tasks  of  the  moment  is  to  create  a  mechanism 
within the international  architecture that will focus on 
trade,  finance,  technology  and  development  policy  in 
an integrated manner.

other  critical  areas  of  the  international  agenda.  One 
such area concerns peace and security. It is tragic and 
painful  to  witness  the  continued  cycle  of  violence 
around 
the  world.  Peace  accords  and  ceasefire 
agreements do not, unfortunately, entail a cessation of 
hostilities. 

We  support  the  strong  will  shown  by  the  United 
Nations,  working  alongside  the  African  Union,  in 
ensuring  that  peace  and  security  are  brought  to  the 
people  in  the  Darfur  region  of  the  Sudan.  Seychelles 
associates itself with all those calling and working for 
peace in Africa, the Middle East, Asia and elsewhere. 

Against the backdrop of increased violence from 
war and terrorism, it is clear to us that violence and the 
use  of  force  cannot  be  the  answer.  We  must  embrace 
multilateralism and insist that international relations be 
guided by the rule of law as the basis for our collective 
security. 
The United Nations remains a significant partner 

and  interlocutor  of  the  modern  development  and 
progress  of  Seychelles.  It  is  with  complete  faith,  as  a 
small island  developing State, that  we  renew our trust 
in  the  principles  of  the  Charter.  We  cannot  stop 
emphasizing  the  compelling  urgency  of  altering  the 
design and function of the Security Council, if it is to 
fulfil the mandate conferred by the Charter of 1945 in 
the realities of the world today. 

With  regard  to  the  General  Assembly,  what  is 
needed is a resuscitation and use of the powers of the 
General Assembly  and  the  assertion  of  its  role  as  the 
principal organ of the United Nations. The Assembly is 
a  forum  of  equals.  Its  pronouncements  and  policy 
decisions  must  carry  the  stamp  of  legitimacy  as  the 
voice  of  the  international  community.  However,  we 
must  emphasize 
irrespective  of  whatever 
institutional  arrangements  we  may  devise,  in  the  final 
analysis, it is the commitment and political will among 
Member States alone that can make the system work.

That  is,  therefore,  the  aim  of  the  Indian  Ocean

represents  today  and  the  place  that  it  occupies  in  the 
landscape of regional cooperation organizations is due, 
in large part, to the specialized agencies of the United

paths of cooperation. 
(spoke in English) 

The  future  of  generations  to  come  rests  not  so 
much on the vigour of our debate and the declarations 
we  make  in  this Assembly  at  its  sixty-second  session, 
but  on  the  action  we  take.  Our  people  are  demanding 
that,  collectively,  we  emerge  with  a  clear  vision,  that 
we display the courage and unrelenting commitment to 
build a world of peace, justice and equity that we can 
inhabit together in true harmony. Let us here resolve to 
build  one  world  where  every  man,  woman  and  child 
can realize the true purpose and fulfilment of life. 
The  Acting  President:  I  now  give  the  floor  to 

His  Excellency  Mr.  Yeshey  Dorgi,  chairman  of  the 
delegation of the Kingdom of Bhutan. 
Mr.  Dorji  (Bhutan):  I  offer  my  delegation’s 

congratulations to the President for his  election as the 
President  of  the  General Assembly  at  its  sixty-second 
session and assure him of our support and cooperation. 
My  delegation  would  also 
to  convey  our 
appreciation  to  his  predecessor,  Sheikha  Haya  Rashed 
Al-Khalifa,  for  the  able  manner  in  which  she  guided 
the work of the Assembly at the sixty-first session. We 
also convey our appreciation to the Secretary-General, 
Mr.  Ban  Ki-moon,  for  the  excellent  leadership  he 
provides to our Organization.  

We  are  gratified  that  climate  change  and  the 
Millennium  Development  Goals  are  among  the  top 
priorities  of  this  session’s  presidency.  The  irony  of 
like 
A/62/PV.15
of 
but 
common 
climate  change  is  that  its  worst  impact  will  be  on  the 
developing  world,  particularly  small  and 
island 
developing countries, who are least responsible for the 
problem. As complex as the issue is, climate change is 
inextricably  linked  to  development  and  the  debate 
engenders  issues  of  equity,  fairness  and  the  right  of 
countries  to  grow  economically.  The  challenges  of 
climate change must, therefore, be addressed within the 
framework of sustainable development bearing in mind 
the 
principle 
differentiated 
responsibilities. 

Bhutan  has  two  major  concerns  about  climate 
change.  First  is  the  potential  adverse  impact  on 
agriculture, which is the mainstay of 79 per cent of our 
population. Second, more serious and immediate, is the 
rate at which Himalayan glaciers are receding. Bhutan 
has  approximately  3,000  glacial  lakes,  of  which  24 
have  been  identified  as  potentially  dangerous.  Floods 
caused  by  glacial 
lake  outbursts  have  caused 
devastation in the past, and future outbursts will be far 
worse.  Our  capacity  to  carry  out  research,  monitor 
developments,  forecast  outbursts  and  take  mitigation 
measures is severely constrained by a lack of scientific, 
technical and financial resources. 

In  the  Millennium  Declaration  of  2000,  world 
leaders undertook to channel the fruits of globalization 
to  benefit  all  people  and  lift  one  sixth  of  humanity 
from  extreme  poverty.  At  the  midpoint  between  the 
adoption  of 
the  Millennium  Development  Goals 
(MDGs) and the target date of 2015, reports, including 
the  2007  Millennium  Development  Goals  Report, 
provide a mixed picture at best. The Secretary-General 
has  rightly  said  that  the  world  does  not  need  new 
promises  to  achieve  the  MDGs.  What  is  needed  is 
urgent  and  concerted  action  by  political  leaders  and 
stakeholders to meet, in their entirety, the commitments 
made  in  the  Millennium  Declaration  and  in  the 
Monterrey Consensus adopted at the 2002 International 
Conference  on  Financing  for  Development  and  at  the 
2005 World Summit. 

The  2006  midterm  comprehensive  global  review 
of the implementation of the Programme of Action for 
the  Least  Developed  Countries  for  the  Decade  2001-
2010  revealed  that  the  least  developed  countries  were 
unlikely  to  achieve  all  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the 
Programme  of  Action,  and  therefore  the  MDGs,  if 
trends  continued.  It

imperative  of  the  international  community  to  help  the

enormous 
challenges to landlocked developing countries. Bhutan 
is  working  closely  with  the  group  of  landlocked 
developing  countries 
those  challenges 
through  the  cooperation  of  transit  countries  and  the 
international  community. The  needs  of  the  landlocked 
countries are well-documented and there is a road map 
for global partnership set out in the Almaty Programme 
of Action. 

Bhutan  has  made  tremendous  socio-economic 
progress  during  the  past  45  years.  However,  there  are 
many hurdles to overcome before we can stand on our 
own  feet  and  be  self-reliant.  We  are  determined  to 
achieve  the  cherished  goal  of  self-reliance  at  the 
earliest time possible. Until then, we will have to rely 
on external  assistance  and support. Here,  I would like 
to  record  my  country’s  appreciation  to  bilateral  and 
multilateral donors. 

the 
President the Assembly will undertake results-oriented 
intergovernmental  negotiations  on  Security  Council 
reform  in  order  to  bring  that  issue  to  its  logical 
conclusion. As we have stated before, Bhutan supports 
India, Japan and their G4 group partners for permanent 
membership.  We  also  support  Africa’s  claim  for 
permanent seats. 

My  country  has  as  much  interest  in  the  work  of 
the Security Council as others and would like to see it 
adapt to current demands and realities. Since becoming 
a Member in 1971, my country has served in a number 
of  important  bodies  of  the  United  Nations,  but  not  in 
the Security Council. We are confident of our capacity 
to  contribute  directly  to  the  work  of  the  Council. 
Bhutan therefore announced in 1999 its candidature for 
a  non-permanent  seat  for  the  period  2013-2014.  If 
realized,  Bhutan  would  gain  entry  into  the  Council 
after  four  decades  in  the  United  Nations.  It  is  our 
sincere  hope  that  the  General  Assembly  will  support 
Bhutan’s candidacy during the elections in 2012.

this  body  of 
developments  in  my  country.  The  development  model 
pursued  by  Bhutan  is  based  on  the  philosophy  of 
“Gross  National  Happiness”,  a  concept  conceived  by 
our 
Jigme  Singye 
Wangchuck, 
the  early  1970s.  Gross  National 
Happiness is premised on the belief that, if happiness is 
the  ultimate  desire  of  every  individual,  then  it  is  the 
responsibility  and  purpose  of  the  State  to  create 
conditions that enable citizens to realize this desire. We 
are glad that the concept of Gross National Happiness 
is  drawing  increasing  global  attention  and  we  stand 
ready to share our experiences in this regard. 

Bhutan  is  now  set  on  the  irreversible  path  to  a 
full-fledged  democratic  constitutional  monarchy.  The 
people  of  Bhutan  are  looking  forward  to  2008,  when 
parliamentary  democracy  will  be  introduced.  Next 
year,  Bhutan  will  also  celebrate  the  formal  coronation 
of His Majesty Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and 
the  centenary  of  the Wangchuck  dynasty. As  we  stand 
at the threshold of these momentous developments, the 
people of Bhutan look to our friends and well-wishers 
and the global community for support and inspiration. 

Before  I  conclude,  allow  me  to  refer  to  the 
comments  made  yesterday  by  the  honourable  Foreign 
Minister of Nepal regarding the problem of the people 
in  camps  in  Nepal.  As  her  comments  were  less  than 
objective, 
that  misperceptions  be 
clarified.  It  is  disingenuous  on  her  part  to  blame 
Bhutan  for  the  lack  of  progress  in  our  bilateral  talks 
when  it  is  widely  known  that  disruptions  to  the 
bilateral  process  resulted  from  the  political  instability 
in  her  country,  which  were  accompanied  by  frequent 
changes  of  Government  and  positions  on  the  issue. 
Bhutan  for  its  part  has  always  been  committed  to  the 
bilateral  process  and  has  not  deviated  from 
the 
understandings  and  agreements  reached  between  the 
two countries. 

The  issue  is  a  highly  complex  one  that  does  not 
lend itself to conventional solutions. The genesis of the 
problem  lies  in  illegal  immigration.  The  camps  were

established  without  any  screening  procedures  when 
only 304 people, claiming to be refugees from Bhutan, 
arrived  in  eastern  Nepal.  Screening  procedures  were 
put in place by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner  for  Refugees  only  after  two  and  a  half 
years, and by then the number had reached its present 
proportion. In view of the complexity of the issue, the 
two Governments had agreed that the bilateral process 
was the only way to find a solution. In this regard, we 
appreciate  the  offer  of  the  United  States  of  America 
and other countries for third country resettlement, as it 
would help address that humanitarian problem. 

While the Royal Government remains committed 
to the bilateral process, it has serious security concerns 
with Maoist infiltration of the camps and the formation 
of  several  radical  groups,  who  have  publicly  stated 
their  objective  of  destabilizing  Bhutan  and  disrupting 
the country’s first parliamentary elections next year. 

In conclusion, I would like to once again convey 
my delegation’s full support to the President and wish 
the General Assembly every success at it sixty-second 
session. Tashi delek. 
The  Acting  President:  I  now  give  the  floor  to 

His Excellency Mr. Elvin Nimrod, Minister for Foreign 
Affairs,  International  Trade,  Legal  Affairs,  Carriacou 
and Petite Martinique Affairs of Grenada. 
Mr.  Nimrod  (Grenada):  I  am  honoured  to  join 

previous delegations in congratulating the President on 
his election as President of this Assembly at its sixty-
second  session.  Let  me  assure  him  of  Grenada’s 
unconditional  support  as  he  guides  our  important  and 
crucial  deliberations  towards  a  fruitful  and  tangible 
conclusion. 

I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mrs. 
Haya  Rashed  Al-Khalifa,  who 
tirelessly 
during her presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-first 
session, and to her timely and productive initiatives. In 
addition, my delegation would like to renew its support 
to  the  Secretary-General  in  his  endeavour  to  advance 
the agenda of the United Nations and to make it more 
effective. 

In his opening remarks to this General Assembly 
the  President  identified  five  areas  as  our  priorities: 
climate 
the 
Millennium  Development  Goals,  terrorism  and  United 
Nations

thus 
to  note 
far,  we  are  heartened 
and  it  is  through  this  lens  that  I  would  like  to  project 
the views of my country. 

On  the  question  of  climate  change,  we  applaud 
the  Secretary-General  for  convening 
the  recently 
concluded  High-level  Event  on  Climate  Change,  and 
we are satisfied that this will provide the stimulus and 
momentum  required  for  the  forthcoming  negotiations 
in  Bali.  Indeed,  for  this  sixty-second  session,  my 
delegation  welcomes  the  tremendous  emphasis  being 
placed on climate change and, based on the statements 
made 
the 
overwhelming commitment to preparing a better world 
for our future generations.  

The  recently  concluded  event  was  not  our  first 
attempt. Climate change was also addressed in Rio de 
Janeiro,  Barbados  and  Mauritius.  It  seems  that  we  are 
blessed  with  a  penchant  for  songs  of  praise  in  this 
multilateral  temple  of  commitment  and  sacrifice.  The 
chorus of our voices reverberates loudly in these halls 
of wisdom, only to sound a hollow note as we exit the 
archways of these chambers and backslide into reality. 
As  in  all  of  these  conferences,  the  real  challenge  that 
we  face  is  to  convert  what  seems  like  a  religious 
fervour  into  good  deeds  in  the  neighbourhood  of  our 
global  village. As  we  preach,  so  too  must  we  become 
converts. Let us move from resolutions to results. 

As  we  head  towards  Bali,  we  must  craft  a 
negotiating 
the 
dimensions  of  the  intergovernmental  process.  That 
table  must  have  seats  for  the  unborn  generations,  as 
well  as  seats  for  this  generation  wishing  to  taste  the 
social and economic prosperity of a new world order. 

Because  of  sea-level  rise,  we  in  the  small  island 
States  face  the  spectre  of  environmental  refugees  and 
our  people  are  already  being  displaced.  For  example, 
the  Maldives  with  its  1,900  islands,  that  country  has 
undertaken 
sea 
defences and in creating safe zone resettlements for its 
people. 

The low-lying islands and countries of the world 
deserve  a  far  more  robust  and  accountable  response 
from  the  international  community.  In  that  regard,  we 
welcome  the  investigation  in  the  Maldives  of  the 
human dimensions of climate change. 

As Grenada knows so well, the effects of climate 
change  represent  the  most  dangerous  threat  to  the 
economic  development,  peace  and  security  and 
significant  expenditure  building 
that  extends  well  beyond

territorial existence of small island States. We therefore 
welcome the efforts of the British Mission here in New 
York, which has worked ceaselessly to raise awareness 
and  understanding  of  the  threat  posed  by  climate 
change,  echoing  the  very  concerns  that  many  small 
States  and  low-lying  coastal  nations  have  raised  over 
the last 15 years. 

In fact, one thing that has become painfully clear 
to Grenada is how easily  — in the blink of an  eye  — 
an  entire  country  can  be  flattened.  In  our  case,  it  was 
the eye of Hurricane Ivan. Hurricanes and cyclones are 
appearing 
latitudes  and  with  greater 
ferocity.  They  are  appearing  further  south  in  the 
Atlantic,  affecting  islands  like  Grenada,  and  they  are 
appearing further north in the Indian Ocean and hit the 
Seychelles  for  the  first  time  in  50  years.  Just  this 
summer  we  have  seen  two  category  five  hurricanes, 
Dean and Felix, make landfall in the Caribbean within 
two  weeks  of  each  other,  causing  loss  of  lives  and 
hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. 

In  Grenada’s  case,  the  destruction  was  twice  its 
gross  domestic  product.  However,  with  the  help  of 
God,  the  resilience  of  the  Grenadian  people,  the  help 
from our Caribbean and international friends including 
the  United  States  of America,  and  with  the  leadership 
of  my  Prime  Minister,  we  continue  our  aspirations  to 
build  back  better.  In  that  regard,  I  would  like  to  pay 
special  tribute  to  the  People’s  Republic  of  China, 
whose  generous  assistance  and  commitment  to  our 
development  have  been  greatly  appreciated  by  the 
Government  and  the  people  of  Grenada.  Because  of 
their help, Grenada was able to host Cricket World Cup 
2007  at  our  new  stadium,  which  was  financed  and 
constructed by the People’s Republic of China. 

Despite  all  concerted  efforts,  climate  change  has 
led  to  a  downward  assessment  of  our  sovereign  credit 
rating  and  Grenada  is  now  under  the  guidance  of  the 
International  Monetary  Fund.  Grenada  cannot  borrow 
money  on  the  international  market  to  replant  its 
nutmeg,  to  mend  its  coastal  infrastructure,  or  to 
upgrade  its  tourism  industry.  As  a  result,  we  have 
imposed a reconstruction levy on our people, at a time 
when global energy and food prices are increasing. The 
economic  burden  of  global  warming  is  hitting  the 
pockets  of  ordinary  women  and  men  in  the  streets  of 
Grenada, the poor farmer, the hardworking teacher and 
the waiters and waitresses in our hotels. Those ordinary 
island citizens are paying the price for the lifestyles of 
the major emitters. 

A  new  paradigm  is  needed  within  the  United 
Nations  system  and  the  Bretton  Woods  institutions. 
Within  that  paradigm  must  lie  an  understanding  that 
small  island  developing  States  have  an  environmental 
and  economic  vulnerability  that  warrants  a  new  set  of 
metrics, a new set of rules and a new level of support. 

As  we  head  towards  a  post-2012  agreement,  we 
need  aggressive  mitigation  targets.  Those  targets  are 
critical  for  us,  because  sea  temperature  rise  is  already 
causing  bleaching  of  the  coastal  reefs.  Loss  of  those 
ecosystems has a harmful impact on fish stocks, one of 
our main sources of protein and foreign exchange. 

The  Caribbean  Community  Climate  Change 
Centre  has  said  that  a  further  one  degree  temperature 
rise  will  lead  to  significant  loss  of  tuna  and  dolphin 
stocks. And to compound the matter, in  Mauritius and 
the  Seychelles,  tuna  stocks  are  diving  deeper  seeking 
cooler  waters.  In  recent  years,  the  fish  catch  has 
dwindled  and  revenues  have  diminished.  To  alleviate 
those problems, more investment is now needed in new 
studies,  as  well  as  in  fishing  technologies,  equipment 
and practices. 
As  we  approach  the  Bali  meeting,  Grenada 

reiterates  its  position,  articulated  by  the  Alliance  of 
Small  Island  States,  that  the  viability  and  adaptability 
of the most vulnerable, such as small island developing 
States,  must  be  the  fundamental  benchmark  against 
which  all  negotiations  are  framed.  In  the  efforts  to 
mitigate climate change, no nation must be left behind. 
Let  that  be  our  guiding  principle,  if  we  are  to  make 
meaningful progress in Bali. 

While these negotiations are ongoing, my country 
and  many  other  islands  and  low-lying  countries  are 
taking  all  necessary  steps  to  cushion  the  fallouts  and 
dislocations.  Adaptation  funding  and  funding  for 
economic development are almost indivisible. 

Grenada  calls  for  the  urgent  completion  of  the 
institutional arrangements for the Adaptation Fund, in a 
manner that guarantees that priority should be given to 
the needs of the small island developing States. On the 
question  of  the  Global  Environmental  Facility,  we 
welcome  the  energy,  enthusiasm  and  flexibility  of  its 
new  Chief  Executive  Officer.  We  are,  however, 
disappointed  with  the  implications  of  the  Resource 
Allocation  Framework.  Nonetheless,  we  look  forward 
to  strengthening  the  working  relationship  with  the 
Facility 
it  more

Climate  change,  energy,  economic  development 
and  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  are  so  tightly 
interwoven that over the long term, we cannot tease out 
any  one  thread  without  weakening  the  fabric  of  our 
common aspirations for prosperity and peace. 
It is well known that women are the most affected 

by  poverty  and 
levels  of 
marginalization.  As  the  United  Nations  continues  its 
study  of  the  issue  of  gender  architecture  and  the 
general  advancement  of  women,  Grenada  sees  the 
empowerment of women as being critical for our own 
development.  We 
to 
contribute  to  the  many  bodies  of  the  United  Nations 
that promote and seek to secure avenues for women in 
the  development  process.  Let  us  contribute  to  their 
budgets and not to their demise; for even if only a few 
benefit,  that  sets  the  stage  for  others  to  follow.  In  our 
view,  the  advancement  of  women  represents  a  most 
powerful  force  for  social  and  economic  progress. 
Investment  in  gender  mainstreaming  is  an  investment 
in  social  justice,  economic  diversity  and  political 
stability. 

The  United  Nations  must  lead  by  example. 
Guided  by  the  tenets  of  the  Millennium  Development 
Goals, Grenada is working assiduously to improve the 
status of women. Several years ago only a few women 
held  high  political  or  other  public  offices  in  Grenada, 
but today we are proud to report that approximately 50 
per cent of the Cabinet of our executive branch is made 
up  of  women  and  that  many  others  hold  top  positions 
within the public service. 

The challenge facing the vulnerable States of the 
world  can  be  resolved  only  if  we  ourselves  transform 
our  thinking  and  reform  our  methodologies.  For  that 
reason,  we  support  the  revitalization  of  the  General 
Assembly.  My  delegation 
the 
expansion  of  the  membership  of  the  Security  Council 
in  both  categories  to  allow  for  a  Council  more 
representative of the 192 States and five regions which 
it  represents.  That  way  we  can  achieve  much  in 
assembling  a  stronger  and  more  powerful  Council 
which will be better able to fulfil its mandate in a fair, 
just and transparent manner. 

Grenada,  as  small  as  it  is,  has  the  honour  to 
highlight  its  humble  but  valuable  contribution  to  the 
securing  of  stability  in  Haiti.  This  year  Grenada  has 
increased  its  deployment  of  police  personnel  to  the 
United  Nations  Stabilization  Mission  in  Haiti.  We

matter  how  minute,  to  the  efforts  of  international 
peacekeeping initiatives. We are, however, hopeful that 
very soon our unit and others like it will no longer be 
needed. 

In  closing,  I  must  indicate  that  despite  the 
challenges  I  have  outlined  relating  to  our  economic 
viability  and  territorial  integrity,  we  still  have  to  pay 
close  attention  to  terrorism  and  other  threats  to  world 
peace and security. Grenada therefore remains steadfast 
in  its  commitment  to  the  international  community  to 
fight  terrorism  in  all  its  forms  and  to  ensure  that  the 
seeds  of  that  poisonous  weed  never  take  root  on  our 
shores.  Grenada

democratic  world  is  our  best  hope  and  therefore 
pledges its full support towards the betterment of lives 
worldwide. I call on all nations, big and small, rich and 
poor, to contribute even more to that noble task. 

We are all obviously singing from the same song 
sheet.  Let  us  harmonize  the  sound  of  our  voices  to 
amplify  action  for  the  citizens  of  our  world.  It  must 
echo triumphantly across the generations, so that when 
it  is  replayed  with  fidelity  to  our  children  and  our 
grandchildren  they  will  listen  with  dignity,  and  not 
with disdain. 
The  Acting  President:  I  now  call  on  Her 

Excellency  Ms.  Lisa  Shoman,  Minister  for  Foreign 
Affairs and Foreign Trade of Belize. 
Ms. Shoman (Belize): For more than 20 years we 

have 
atmospheric 
temperatures,  the  depletion  of  the  ozone  layer,  rising 
sea  levels  and  the  impending  inundation  of  low-lying 
coastal  areas. Now that the climate change debate has 
finally  become  the  rage,  those  of  us  who  see  the 
change  and  worry  about 
inevitable  must 
unfortunately  still  contend  with  entrenched  special 
interests who, despite the overwhelming evidence now 
available, continue to argue otherwise. 
We  are  focusing  our  general  debate  on  climate 

change,  and  it  is  the  hope  of  my  delegation  that  this 
will lead to more decisive action by all Member States 
so  that  we  can  begin  to  make  the  changes  we  believe 
are necessary for us to reverse the trends which so far 
continue to lead us down a destructive path. 

We  already  agree  that  negotiations  on  action  to 
tackle  climate  change  should  be  conducted  within  the 
United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate

Change. We  subscribe  to  the  principle  that  each  of  us 
has a role to play. Those  who are the largest polluters 
must  reverse  these  trends.  Those  who  are  not  among 
the largest  polluters must take the necessary measures 
aimed at mitigation, as well as adaptation methods, to 
help in reversing those trends. 

Developed  countries  must  recognize  the  special 
needs  of  the  most  vulnerable,  in  order  to  support  our 
efforts  towards  sustainable  development  and  to  assist 
us to make our communities more adaptable to change. 
We must develop the capacity to take action. We must 
adopt more sustainable practices. For that to occur we 
must  take  specific  action  to  limit  greenhouse  gas 
emissions.  It  is  not  enough  to  say  that  we  will  reduce 
harmful  emissions.  We  have  been  saying  that  since 
Rio; we must do it. 

The  European  Union  commitment  on  climate 
change  is  important  politically,  but  we  need  to  move 
beyond 
to  action.  Other  developed 
countries and regions, as well as emerging economies, 
must  take  substantial  steps  towards  mitigation  and 
develop  and  share  the  technologies  which  result  in 
low-carbon or no-carbon economies. 
In Belize, the symbiosis between our ecology and 

is  evident.  Agricultural  production, 
our  economy 
fishing,  mineral 
hydrocarbon 
exploration  as  well  as  tourism  are  all  subject  to  the 
caprices  of  the  climate.  Must  we  also  be  subjected  to 
an  uneven  playing  field  in  the  arena  of  international 
trade,  which  is  fast  reaching  the  crisis  level?  To  mix 
metaphors,  sometimes  a  rising 
tide  can  swamp 
vulnerable boats. 

keep 
development  in  perspective  in  the  current  climate 
change  debate,  since,  as  has  been  said  before, 
economic  development  better  enables  countries  to 
tackle climate change. Our focus on the urgency of the 
current situation should not, however, detract from the 
equally urgent if not dire situation of the development 
agenda,  resulting  from  complex  factors  including 
climate  change  and  the  failure  of  the  international 
economic system to reinvent itself. 
At the heart of the crisis is a fundamental distrust,

answer is no, we can expect to see even more bilateral 
and  regional  arrangements,  resulting  in  a  movement 
away  from  the  idea  that  together  we  are  better  at 
solving our common problems. 

The discussions on climate change and the larger 
development  debate  exhibit  the  need  for  an  effective, 
legitimate multilateral system that is fair and balanced 
and that operates in a transparent and inclusive manner. 
Responsible 
the  basic 
principles  of  justice  and  the  rule  of  law  is  even  more 
critical  to  achieving  that  system  and  maintaining  its 
integrity. 

It  is  in  this  spirit  of  respect  for  law  and  justice 
and of the desire for equity and for the preservation of 
human  rights  that  we  continue  to  struggle  with  the 
decision  of  this  body  to  exclude  any  true  debate  over 
the  inclusion  of  the  right  of  the  23  million  people  of 
Taiwan to representation in this institution. The desire 
of the people of Taiwan is not only to take part in the 
deliberations  of  this  institution  but,  indeed,  to  be 
engaged  on  the  critical  issues  facing  the  international 
community.  We  remain  steadfast  in  our  support  for 
their aspirations and will continue to advocate for their 
representation, as well as that of the Saharawi people, 
who lack a voice in our United Nations. 

We  continue  to  monitor  the  situation  in  the 
Middle  East  with  great  concern.  The  question  of 
Palestine  remains  the  crux  of  the  conflicts  in  the 
region.  In  that  regard,  it  is  high  time  that  we  realized 
the  vision  of  two  States,  Palestine  and  Israel,  living 
side by side in peace  and security. We join those who 
expect  that  the  international  meeting  to  be  held  in  the 
near  future  will  yield  results  substantial  enough  to 
translate that vision into reality. 

The United Nations remains the key institution to 
facilitate  cooperation  and  build  global  solidarity  to 
solve  our  pressing  economic,  social  and  political 
problems.  Its  effectiveness  has  been  challenged.  The 
United Nations and its Member States have responded 
to  this  challenge  by  embarking  on  a  comprehensive 
reform  process  to  overhaul  the  system  and  to  ensure 
that it is better  equipped to meet contemporary global 
demands.

work. 
The  Acting  President:  I  now  call  on  His 

Excellency  Mr.  Ednan  Karabaev,  Minister  for  Foreign 
Affairs of the Kyrgyz Republic. 
Mr.  Karabaev  (Kyrgyzstan)  (spoke  in  Russian): 

At  the  outset,  let  me  join  others  in  congratulating  Mr. 
Srgjan  Kerim  on  his  election  to  the  presidency  of  the 
General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I assure 
him  that  the  delegation  of  Kyrgyzstan  stands  ready  to 
cooperate with him. On behalf of my delegation I wish 
him every success in fulfilling his responsibilities. 
I  wish  to  pay  tribute  to  Her  Excellency  Sheikha 

Haya  Rashed  Al-Khalifa 
for  her  outstanding 
stewardship during the previous session of the General 
Assembly. 

I  would  also  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to 
congratulate the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. 
Ban  Ki-moon,  on  his  election 
to  his  high  and 
responsible  post  and  to  wish  him  every  success  in  his 
important work. I am confident that his vast experience 
and diplomatic skill will enable him to achieve all the 
goals of the United Nations. 

It  would  no  doubt  be  difficult  to  come  to  a 
common  agreement  about  the  date  on  which  the  new 
millennium  began  —  whether  it  started  with  the 
tragedy  of  2001  or  harks  back  to  1991,  when  the 
structure of the world order changed. I believe that the 
proponents  of  either  theory  would  agree  that  a  new

A/62/PV.15
through  cooperation  among  States  and 
period  has  emerged:  a  time  when  the  interdependence 
of States has become a vivid reality leading to greater 
vulnerability.  Problems  have  become  global,  whereas 
globalization has become localized. 
In  the  face  of  all  these  dilemmas,  the  United 

Nations  unswervingly  maintains 
its  status  as  an 
organization whose core value is to promote the moral 
principles of solidarity. The formation of a global civil 
society  and  the  recognition  of  universally  accepted 
rights  and  freedoms  under  the  auspices  of  the  United 
Nations play a significant role in furthering the process 
of consolidation. 

This  clearly  shows  that  society  is  capable  of 
refraining from war and solving its problems by using 
its  peacekeeping  potential.  Thoughtfully  building  the 
future is not possible without reviewing and continuing 
strategic  planning  of  socio-economic  development. 
Fifteen  years  ago,  one  of  the  most  noteworthy  of 
United  Nations  conferences  took  place  at  Rio  de 
Janeiro. There, the concept of sustainable development 
was  defined  as  a  new  tenet  for  humankind.  The  main 
purpose was to create a new mechanism enabling us to 
resolve  existing  social  tensions  and  to  prevent  future 
ones 
the 
formation of a global civil society. 

The  relationship  between  the  State  and  the 
society  develops  differently  in  each  country.  The 
Kyrgyz  Republic  has  come  a  long  way  in  affirming 
democratic  values,  conducting  constitutional  reform 
and  fiscal  decentralization. All  this  has  been  reflected 
in  the  national  development  strategy  approved  by  the 
President  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mr.  Kurmanbek 
Bakiev.  The  aim  of  that  document  is  to  achieve 
sustainable  development  by  2010;  it  is  based  on  the 
principles of self-fulfilment and human security, which 
are the basic source of positive change in the sphere of 
human development. 

At  the  same  time,  we  are  well  aware  that  long-
term  sustainable  development  depends  on  the  stability 
of  human  relationships  based  on  an  understanding  of 
how to use existing resources for social and economic 
development  today  and  of  what  we  must  leave  for 
future generations. 

Seven  years  ago,  the  General Assembly  adopted 
the  Millennium  Development  Goals,  thereby  defining 
our objectives for the future and the conditions needed 
to  achieve  them.  Attainment  of  the  eight  Goals  and 
tackling of the 15 challenges will serve as a basis both

for  our  global initiative  and for realizing the potential 
of regional development. 

Nevertheless,  level  of  development  varies  from 
region  to  region.  This  is  particularly  relevant  for 
mountainous regions, which require a different strategy 
for  sustainable  development  which  takes  into  account 
each  area’s  specific  potential  in  natural  resources.  In 
addition  to  defining  the  ecological  parameters,  it  is 
necessary  to  define  the  economic  and  geographic 
peculiarities  of  mountainous  regions  that  call  for  a 
special  system  of  management  which  would  give 
priority 
their 
significant  resource  potential,  mountainous  territories 
need to address as a priority problems related to living 
standards and quality of life. In that regard, the Kyrgyz 
Republic  believes  that  a  second  Global  Mountain 
Summit  should  be  convened,  at  which  we  could 
formulate 
for 
mountainous  regions,  along  with  relevant  norms  of 
international law. 

Even  what  is  seemingly  the  most  insignificant 
social  inequality  can  destroy  the  social  integrity  of 
humankind.  Similarly,  equal  protection  of  rights  and 
freedoms  and  the  adoption  of  universal  values  of 
respect for human life enable us to fulfil the principles 
of the Seville Statement Violence, which defines war as 
a product of human culture. 

The primary source of conflict is, in fact, lack of 
social  responsibility.  The  development  strategy  of 
every 
social 
responsibility  as  a  basic  characteristic  for  elaborating 
approaches  to  regional  and  global  coordination,  thus 
improving 
the  environment  and  reducing  energy 
shortages.  Regional  parameters  of  responsibility  will 
then  create  a  new  type  of  society,  which  will  be  no 
longer a society at risk, but rather a society of security. 

I have no doubt that all of today’s participants, as

such  mechanisms  include  both  the  monitoring  of  joint

framework of the most effective implementation of the 
MDGs.  The  initiative  of  the  Kyrgyz  President  to

the General Assembly to consider adopting a resolution 
to that effect at the current session. 

The  establishment  of  social  justice  has  been  a 
dream of humankind for  many millennia. There was a 
time  when  some  were  burned  at 
the  stake  for 
entertaining  such  dreams  or  attempting  to  establish  a 
community  of  social  justice. At  one  time,  dictatorship 
and  authoritarianism  prospered  under  the  pretext  of  a 
call  to  social  justice.  That  happened  because  of  a 
disparity  between  the  proclaimed  elevated  goals  and 
the means of their achievement. 

In the third millennium, the world’s nations have 
defined  development  goals  in  the  framework  of  a 
united society. The means to achieve those goals must 
correspond  to  a  high  level  of  civic  awareness  of  the 
potential  of  peacekeeping.  We  already  have 
the 
grounds  for  a  constructive  dialogue  defining  the 
dynamics 
humankind’s 
development.  The  United  Nations  has  been  a 
foundation of such dialogue for several decades. 

Allow  me  from  this  rostrum  to  confirm  the 
adherence  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  to  the  goals  and 
purposes  of  the  United  Nations  to  maintain  peace, 
security and a prosperous life for all the nations of the 
Earth. 
The  Acting  President:  I  now  give  the  floor  to 

His  Excellency  Mr.  Charles  Savarin,  Minister  for 
Foreign Affairs, Trade,  Labour  and  the  Public  Service 
of the Commonwealth of Dominica. 
Mr.  Savarin  (Dominica):  Let  me  at  the  outset 

congratulate Mr. Kerim on his election as President of 
the  General  Assembly  at  its  sixty-second  session  and 
assure  him  of 
the  Dominica 
delegation  throughout  this  session.  I  commend  his 
predecessor,  Sheikha  Haya  Rashed Al-Khalifa,  for  her 
leadership during the sixty-first session of the General 
Assembly. 

I also wish to congratulate Secretary-General Ban 
Ki-moon  on  his  election.  I  wish  him  a  long  and 
successful  tenure,  and  hope  that  under  his  leadership 
the  United  Nations  will  give  greater  attention  to  the 
plight  of  the  world’s  small  island  developing  States, 
which  are  among  the  most  vulnerable  to  climate 
change, natural disasters and a rise in sea levels.

peace,  democracy,  human  rights  and  development 
depends  on  strong  multilateral  institutions.  Dominica 
believes  that  it  is  only  a  strong  United  Nations, 
sensitive  to  the  variable  geometry  of  its  own  complex 
construction,  that  can  serve  as  the  foundation  of  our 
shared  ambitions  for  effective  multilateralism  and  a 
rules-based international order. 

The  experience  of  the  past  decade  has  taught  us 
one important lesson: global challenges  require global 
responses,  and 
the 
appropriate  responses  only  through  the  framework  of 
multilateral  action.  The  United  Nations 
the 
undisputed centre for multilateralism, and we must all 
demonstrate unwavering commitment to vesting in the 
United  Nations  the  authority  and  to  offering  it  the 
space 
the 
interest  of  the  preservation  of  human  life,  human 
rights, peace, justice, democracy and the rule of law. 

More than ever, we need a United Nations which 
is  not  only  guided  by  the  principles  that  oversaw  its 
creation,  but  capable  of  adapting  to  the  growing 
challenges  of  today’s  globalized  world.  We  need  an 
effective  United  Nations  that  will  place  the  highest 
priority  on  development,  while  having  the  capacity  to 
respond to the various crises that threaten international 
peace and security. 

The  work  of  the  international  community  in 
poverty  alleviation  must  be  accelerated  as  the  chasm 
between  the  rich  and  the  poor  continues  to  widen.  In 
that  connection,  the  importance  of  achieving  the 
Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  by  2015  is 
critical. We  must  therefore  rededicate  ourselves  to  the 
implementation of the actions called for in the United 
Nations  Decade  for  the  Eradication  of  Poverty  and  in 
relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, including 
those

territorial  existence  of  small  island  developing  States, 
and low-lying islands in the Indian Ocean, the Pacific 
and the Caribbean may simply disappear in the next 30 
years  or  less  as  the  melting  of  ice  caps  and  mountain 
glaciers  on  all  continents  becomes  the  new  reality  of 
unchecked  climate  change.  The  disappearance  of 
beaches  and  coastal  tourism  plants  and  the  loss  of 
coastal  communication  infrastructure  would  devastate 
the  tourism  economy  of  most  island  States.  Other 
regions are also beginning to experience the effects of 
those  climatic  changes,  with  persistent  conditions  of 
drought followed by devastating flooding. 

Rising  sea  temperature  is  causing  death  and  the 
bleaching  of  coral  reefs,  which  in  turn  are  impacting 
negatively  on  fish  stocks,  the  major  protein  source  of 
island States. It is estimated that a one-degree increase 
in  sea  temperature  over  pre-industrial  levels  will  lead 
to significant loss of tuna and dolphin stocks for a large 
number of island States. 

Rising  sea  temperature  also  provides  a  fertile 
ground  for  the  development  of  tropical  storms  and 
hurricanes,  which  affect  the  Caribbean  region  every 
year.  Climate  change  is  contributing  to  the  frequency 
and  severity  of  those  storms.  We  are  currently  in  the 
midst  of  the  2007  hurricane  season  and,  over  a  two-
week  period  in  the  month  of  August,  the  Caribbean 
region  suffered 
two  category-5 
hurricanes,  Dean  and  Felix.  Those  storms  seriously 
affected  Dominica,  Guadeloupe,  Martinique,  Saint 
Lucia,  Jamaica,  Belize,  Honduras,  Nicaragua  and 
Mexico.  We  are  only  half-way  through  this  hurricane 
season,  which  is  forecast  to  have  seven  category-5 
hurricanes. It may very well be that the worst is yet to 
come. 

My  own  country,  Dominica,  was  severely 
battered  by  Hurricane  Dean,  the  third-worst  hurricane 
to make landfall in the Caribbean since 1850. After 15 
hours of buffeting by winds of 110 miles per hour and 
continuous  rainfall,  our  agricultural  economy  was 
destroyed,  our  infrastructure  devastated  by  swollen 
rivers and numerous landslides, and our housing stock 
seriously affected. We appreciate greatly the solidarity 
of  a  number  of  countries,  regional  and  extra-regional, 
and 
the 
immediate  aftermath,  but  now  comes  the  serious 
challenge of reconstruction, which is estimated to cost 
over a $100 million.

The high-level event on climate change helped to 
underscore  that  doing  nothing  about  climate  change 
will  have  enormous  negative  implications  for  all 
countries, and more particularly for the least developed 
countries and small island developing States. The pace 
of climate change negotiations is disconcertingly slow 
because it is not adequately responsive to the urgency 
dictated by science. 

We  urge  all  the  nations  of  the  world  to  come  to 
Bali in December prepared to advance the multilateral 
negotiations.  A  demonstration  of  collective  political 
will  and  commitment  to  determined  action  will  be 
critical if we are to reach agreement on a fair, effective, 
flexible and inclusive climate regime under the United 
Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change 
and  its  Kyoto  Protocol.  Developed  countries  and  the 
more  advanced  developing  countries  must  make  a 
greater  effort  to  do  more  and  to  be  considerate  of  the 
emergency situation facing the small island States. 

We continue to stress that the vulnerable situation 
of the small island developing States must be addressed 
through  the  vigorous  implementation  of  the  actions 
called  for  in  the  Mauritius  Strategy  for  the  Further 
Implementation  of  the  Programme  of  Action  for  the 
Sustainable  Development  of  Small  Island  Developing 
States. 

We  call  for  the  full  implementation  of  the 
mandates  contained  in  the  Millennium  Declaration,  in 
particular 
to  development  and 
poverty  eradication,  the  protection  of  the  common 
environment,  and  the  realization  of  human  rights, 
democracy and good governance. As a follow-up to the 
reform  commitments  emanating 
the  2005 
Summit,  we  welcome  the  reports  of  the  High-level 
Panel  and  of  the  Secretary-General  on  system-wide 
coherence,  and  we  hope  for  the  strengthened  capacity 
of  the  United  Nations  in  development,  humanitarian 
assistance and the environment. 

The  adoption  of  the  Global  Counter-Terrorism 
Strategy  by  the  General  Assembly  was  an  important 
achievement. It will be meaningless, however, if we do 
not  address  its  full  implementation.  Small  States  like 
Dominica  and  the  rest  of  the  States  members  of  the 
Organization  of  the  Eastern  Caribbean  States  must  be 
assisted to meet the various obligations required by the 
implementation of the counter-terrorism conventions.

Dominica  applauds  the  African  Union  for  its 
unwavering  efforts  towards  the  maintenance  of  peace 
and  security  on  the  African  continent,  and  we  are 
supportive of the long-term vision of an African peace 
and  security  architecture.  In  that  context,  Dominica 
welcomes  the  creation  of  the  African  Union-United 
Nations  Hybrid  Operation  in  Darfur,  which  we  hope 
will contribute to the political resolution of the conflict 
there  and  bring  to  an  end  its  tragic  humanitarian 
consequences  in  the  Sudan  and  the  neighbouring 
States.

Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) to 
a  longer-term  engagement  that  will  bring  sustainable 
economic  stability  and  development  to  Haiti.  We 
appreciate  the  important  role  of  Brazil  and  the  other 
Member  States  that  are  participating  in  MINUSTAH, 
but we must be careful not to see those interventions as 
the emergency response of an international fire brigade 
quickly  extinguishing  political  conflagrations  and 
remaining  only  long  enough  to  dampen  the  embers  of 
renewed conflict.

Recent  violent  upheavals  in  Myanmar  are  not

standing  difficulties  afflicting  that  country  in  its 
transition  to  democracy.  We  urge  influential  countries 
in South-East Asia that have friendly relations with the 
military regime in Rangoon to use their good offices in 
support  of  the  United  Nations  effort  to  bring  about  a 
political solution and national reconciliation among all 
concerned parties.

The  continued  presence  of  the  Republic  of 
France,  the  Kingdom  of  the  Netherlands,  the  United 
Kingdom  and  the  United  States  of  America  in  the 
Caribbean  should  provide  an  opportunity  for  the 
strategic engagement of those metropoles, Canada and 
Spain  with  the  independent  Caribbean  States  to  create 
in  the  Caribbean  a  zone  of  peace,  security  and 
prosperity, complementing the invaluable development 
assistance  of  the  People’s  Republic  of  China,  the 
Republic  of  Cuba, 
the  Bolivarian  Republic  of 
Venezuela, Japan and the European Union. 

I wish to underscore the vital importance of a fair 
global trading system as the only way for small States 
to survive in this globalized world. We do not want to 
depend  on  fast-disappearing  development  assistance. 
We want to have the assurance that we will be able to 
trade the goods and services we produce on terms and 
conditions  that  will  enable  us  to  build  our  economies 
and  to  provide  employment  for  our  citizens.  That  is 
why  we  continue  to  call  for  the  earliest  possible 
conclusion  of  the  Doha  Development  Round  of  the 
World  Trade  Organization  (WTO). We  urge  the  major 
trading  nations  to  demonstrate  a  spirit  of  compromise 
and  constructiveness,  backed  by  a  genuine  will  to 
commit  to  a  balanced  agreement  that  embraces  the 
principle of special and differential treatment for small 
island developing States and places development at the 
centre of any final agreement. 

Dominica  has  made  important  progress  in  its 
quest  to  adapt  to  the  challenges  of  trade  liberalization 
and  its  attendant  preference  erosion.  Those  changing 
terms  of  trade  have  progressively  devastated  our 
primary  source  of  foreign  exchange  earnings  —  the 
export  of  bananas.  That  persistent  assault  on  our 
banana  exports 
through 
unrelenting  recourse  to  the  WTO  dispute  settlement 
body has impacted negatively on our overall economy. 
As  a  result,  we  have  had  to  undergo  a  structural 
adjustment  programme  and  undertake  stringent  fiscal 
measures 
the 
population  as  a  whole  in  order  to  stabilize  the 
deteriorating  fiscal  and  economic  position.  We  have 
turned the corner and returned to a period of sustained 
economic  growth,  and  are  moving  steadily  to  the 
diversification  of  our  economy.  The 
impact  of 
Hurricane  Dean  so  soon  afterwards  will  therefore  be 
doubly devastating. 
We  are  working  towards  a  new  energy  regime 

that will significantly reduce our dependence on fossil 
required  sacrifices  by 
the  European  Union 
that  have

further 
the  developing  countries  must  work 
fuels for our energy needs and slow the haemorrhaging 
of  scarce  foreign  exchange  earnings  to  meet  the  ever-
rising cost of petroleum products. We plan to increase 
our  current  40-per  cent  renewable  energy  generation 
from  hydropower  through  initiatives  for  geothermal 
energy  development  and 
expansion  of 
hydropower.  We  will  need  the  continuing  partnership 
of  the  development  partners  to  remain  on  that  path 
towards successful economic transformation. 

May  I  call  on  the  United  Nations  once  more  to 
rededicate  itself  to  making  development  the  highest 
priority of this body. Together, the developed countries 
and 
in  a 
cooperative  manner  to  address  the  challenges  of 
climate  change  and  sustainable  development.  We  can 
work together to defeat poverty and underdevelopment 
and to give hope and dignity to all peoples. To achieve 
that,  we  must  implement  the  decisions  that  we  take 
here in this General Assembly every year. The time for 
action is now. 
The  Acting  President:  I  now  give  the  floor  to 

His  Excellency  The  Honourable  Natanaera  Kirata, 
Minister of Public Works and Utilities of the Republic 
of Kiribati. 
Mr.  Kirata  (Kiribati):  I  bring  warm  greetings 

from my Government and the people of the Republic of 
Kiribati, on whose behalf I am honoured and privileged 
to address this important gathering this afternoon.

my  sincere  congratulations  to  Mr.  Kerim  on  his 
election  as  President  of  the  General  Assembly  at  its 
sixty-second  session.  I  am  confident  that  with  his 
wisdom, experience and diplomatic skill, he will steer 
the course of this Assembly to a successful conclusion. 
Let me assure him that Kiribati pledges its full support 
to him in the performance of his challenging task.

Our  world  is  confronted  more  than  ever  with  a 
number of serious threats and major challenges. Every 
year,  we  all  come  together  from  different  parts  of  the 
world to this beautiful city of New York with our hopes 
of  finding  practical  and  workable  solutions  to  those 
challenges.  Indeed,  situations  in  some  regions  of  the 
world  show  no  sign  of  improvement  and  are  further 
confronted by crises that have proven difficult to settle. 
Those challenges affect us each as individual countries, 
small  and  big, 
rich  and  poor,  developing  and 
developed.  In  a  world  characterized  by  globalization 
and interdependence, the need for the human family to 
undertake  constructive  and  sustained  cooperation  has 
become more urgent. 

With  the  growing  complexity  and  uncertainty  of 
events in this world of ours, especially in the context of 
globalization  and  with 
the  emergence  of  new 
challenges  to  peace  and  security,  the  fulfilment  of  the 
role  of  the  United  Nations  remains  critical.  Kiribati 
remains  committed  to  supporting  the  reform  of  the 
United Nations. 

We  continue  to  believe  that  the  reform  of  this 
Organization  is  in  the  best  interests  of  humanity,  and 
we  would  like  to  see  the  reform  processes  move 
forward  and  be  concluded  as  early  as  practicable  in 
order  for  the  Organization  to  be  able  to  respond 
effectively  to  today’s  challenges  to  global  peace, 
security and economic and social progress. 

Seeking  peace  and  economic  development 
represents  the  common  wish  of  all  nations.  Without 
global peace there can be little positive development in 
our countries. Kiribati is committed, within its resource 
and capacity constraints, to working closely with other 
like-minded  countries  in  pursuit  of  world  peace  and 
stability,  economic  development  and  progress  of 
mankind.  As 
universal  multilateral 
international  organization,  the  United  Nations  remains 
the best forum for allowing all States to come together 
to resolve problems of a global character, regardless of 
their size or wealth. 

States Members of the United Nations are all too 
aware that globalization has brought us all to a point at 
which everything is interconnected and the well-being 
of  almost  every  citizen 
is  affected  by  global 
developments.  Events  that  happen  in  one  part  of  the 
world have a direct bearing on the rest of the world. 
Sometimes  however,  we  are  all  affected  and 

involved  in  a  much  more  substantial  way.  Like  other 
only

least  developed  countries  and  small  island  developing 
States,  Kiribati  has  so  many  constraints.  Our  very 
remoteness 
from  world  market  centres,  narrow 
economic  base  and  high  population  growth  rates  are 
factors  that  we  must  contend  with.  The  continuing 
sharp increase in world oil prices and our total reliance 
on imported oil and fossil fuel has already put a lot of 
pressure  on  our  economy.  Our  options  for  containing 
the  adverse  impact  of  increasing  world  oil  prices  are 
very limited. We must also contend with the HIV/AIDS 
pandemic  and 
tuberculosis,  among  others,  which 
require  the  diversion  of  the  already  meagre  resources 
we have at our disposal to finance our development. 

Those  complex  economic  situations  of  ours  will 
continue to undermine our efforts and determination to 
realize 
the  Millennium 
Development  Goals  and  other  internationally  agreed 
development  goals.  In  order  to  be  able  to  realize  our

Members of this noble institution, such as my own. 

Even with those complex economic development 
challenges, we are forced to operate in an environment 
of uncertainty. I say “uncertainty” as our very survival 
as a nation and as a people with a distinct culture and 
way of life is at great risk, as we are being threatened 
by global warming and sea-level rise. 

Our islands are widely dispersed and small; most 
rise  barely  over  0.2  metres  above  mean  sea  level.  For 
countries  such  as  Kiribati,  global  warming  and  sea-
level rise are critical security concerns. Those concerns 
are  ones  that  we,  as  individual  countries  and  as 
members  of  this  collective  body,  need  to  continue  to 
work together to address. 

We  will  continue  to  call  on  the  international 
community  to  agree  on  a  unified  global  response  to 
those  environment  issues.  We  will  also  continue  to 
work  with  like-minded  countries  in  pushing  the  case 
for a unified global response to those issues. As a small 
country,  Kiribati  places  great  confidence  on 
the 
international  community  for  its  survival,  and  we  hope 
that  our  repeated  appeals  to  this  body  to  address  that 
critical issue will receive stronger political support and 
commitment this time. There is no more time to debate

the issue, as climate change is now a fact of life. It is 
now  time  to  put  words  into  action  so  that  this  living 
planet  is  protected  from  complete  destruction  and 
preserved for use by our many generations to come. 

We  wish  to  commend  the  Secretary-General  for 
his initiative in calling the high-level event on climate 
change on 24 September this year. That in itself means 
a  lot  to  those  who  are  now  living  under  the  cloud  of 
desperation, fear and uncertainty. We remain confident 
that  further  meaningful  actions  will  follow  and  that 
consensus  will  soon  be  achieved  on  finding  a  global 
solution to climate change before it is too late. 

Terrorism  is  an  ongoing  concern  that  affects  all 
countries large and small. Kiribati condemns terrorism 
in  all  its  various  forms  and  manifestations  and  will 
continue to support the global fight against terrorism. 

This  time  last  year,  Kiribati  joined  other  States 
Members  of  the  United  Nations  in  expressing  our 
disappointment  over 
the  continued  neglect  and 
rejection  of  the  desire  of  the  23  million  people  of 
Taiwan to join this Organization. It is further saddening 
to  note  that  Taiwan’s  request  for  admission  this  year 
was  again  not  given  a  fair  opportunity  to  be  heard  by 
the General Assembly. 

With  a  population  of  23  million,  giving  it  the 
forty-seventh  largest  population  in  the  world,  Taiwan 
has  continued  to  respect  and  abide  by  the  United 
Nations Charter based on the principles of democracy, 
mutual respect and understanding. We feel that Taiwan 
and  its  23  million  people  deserve  justice  from  this 
noble  institution.  It  is  Kiribati’s  fervent  hope  that 
Taiwan  will  one  day  be  given  the  nod  to  assume  its 
rightful place in this highly respected Organization. 

Let  us  all  work  together  to  make  this  world  a 
better  place  —  a  place  where  citizens  of  all  of  our 
nations  can  live  together  in  harmony,  peace,  security 
and prosperity for many years to come. 
The  Acting  President:  I  now  give  the  floor  to 

His Excellency Mr. Hussein Elabe Fahiye, Minister for

Mr. Fahiye (Somalia): It is indeed an honour for 

me to extend to Mr. Kerim the sincere congratulations 
of the Government of Somalia upon his election to the 
presidency of the General Assembly. His tenure comes 
at  a  crucial  period  for  the  international  community  as 
tensions  and  instability  have  surfaced  and  the  United

changing  reforms.  My  delegation  is  confident  that  he 
will  rise 
this  body 
competently during the sixty-second session. 

Fitting  tribute  is  also  due  to  his  predecessor, 
Sheikha  Haya  Rashed  Al-Khalifa,  for  her  sterling 
guidance  and  exemplary  way  of 
the 
proceedings  of  the  sixty-first  session  of  the  General 
Assembly during some of the most trying times for the 
United Nations. 
Permit  me  also  to  express  on  behalf  of  the 

Transitional  Federal  Government  of  Somalia  my 
sincere felicitations to the new Secretary-General, Mr. 
Ban  Ki-moon,  who  has  had  a  distinguished  career  in 
international diplomacy and who brings that extensive 
experience to the United  Nations. Those skills will  be 
crucial in his new assignment. We are confident that he 
will be a beacon of hope in keeping the United Nations 
ideal alive during the years ahead. 

May  I  also  take  this  opportunity  to  congratulate 
Ms. Asha-Rose Migiro on her appointment to the High 
Office of Deputy Secretary-General. 
The President returned to the Chair. 


One of the major principles of the United Nations 
Charter  is  to  maintain  peace  and  security,  and  to  that 
end  to  take  effective  measures  for  the  prevention  and 
removal  of  breaches  to  world  peace  and  security.  It  is 
in  that  conviction  that  I  appear  before  this  body  to 
underscore the concerns of the Federal Government of 
Somalia on political and security matters related to the 
roles  that  should  be  assumed  by  the  international 
community. 

Regrettably,  we  feel  that  our  major  efforts  in 
nation-building and State-institution development have 
met  with  an  unreceptive  response  and  reticence  of  an 
inexplicable  nature.  Collective  action  by  this  world 
body has been more consistent and vigorous, until very 
recently, in coming to the rescue of nations in dire need 
of  help.  A 
that 
incomprehensible attitude is the long-delayed adoption

indirect  acquiescence  to  prolonging  the  agony  of  the 
Somali  people.  We  call  upon  the  United  Nations  to

The Transitional Federal Government of Somalia 
has  diligently  embarked  on  implementing  the  tasks 
mandated  by  our  Charter  before  the  end  of  the 
transitional period in 2009. Those include, among other 
things,  securing  democratic  transformation,  putting  in 
place  permanent  constitutional  legality,  establishing  a 
multi-party democratic society, and setting up regional 
autonomous administrations. The federal institutions in 
charge of that arduous task are working hard to provide 
the nation with a federal constitution that upholds those 
fundamental  obligations,  thus  signalling  a  new  era  of 
tranquillity for the Somali people. 

the  Federal  Government 
culminated  in  the  convening  of  a  peace  and  national 
reconciliation  conference 
this  year, 
indicating  that  national  consciousness  is  regenerating 
within  our  society  and  a  self-healing  process  has 
begun. 

terrorist 
elements  that  tried  to  hijack  the  proceedings,  the 
conference 
conclusion. 
Representatives  of  all  walks  of  life  in  the  Somali 
community  attended  the  conference  and  dealt  with 
issues  of  concern  in  every  aspect.  In  that  regard,  we 
pay special tribute to the helping hand of the Ethiopian 
forces  and  the  Uganda-led  African  Union  Mission  in 
Somalia,  which  effectively  dealt  with  the  terrorists, 
who are gradually fading away. 

Here,  I  wish  to  underscore  that  peace,  security 
and  the  well-being  and  prosperity  of  individuals  and 
nations alike are at stake in the fight against terrorism. 
It is our view that the only viable response to terrorism 
is a collective response of all nations, and it is for that 
reason  that  the  United  Nations  system  has  a  pivotal 
role  to  play  and  vital  contributions  to  make  in  many 
aspects  of  counter-terrorism,  from  promoting  the  rule 
of  law  and  effective  criminal  justice  systems  to 
ensuring  that  countries  have  the  means  to  counter 
terrorism.  No  other  institution  has  the  means  to  unify 
nations  in  the  fight  against  that  evil,  and  there  is  no 
better  venue  for  nations  to  forge  their  protective 
measures. 

Our  efforts  aimed  at  nation-building,  restoring 
peace  and  stability,  conflict  resolution,  reconstruction 
and  rehabilitation  cannot  have  the  expected  impact 
unless  the  required  funding  resources  and  the  needed 
equipment and supplies are made available as the days 
of institutional disharmony are replaced by an immense 

and 
convening 
to  organizing 
aspiration to rebuild the country. We therefore reiterate 
our  repeated  calls  for  a  pledging  conference,  and 
appeal  to  the  donor  community  to  show  serious 
commitment 
an 
international  donor  conference,  in  coordination  with 
the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia. 

Another  area  that  cries  out  for  speedy  action  is 
the humanitarian needs in Somalia. As members are all 
aware, 
the  protracted  civil  war  and  persistent 
fragmented  conflicts  over  the  past  two  decades  have 
been  exacerbated  by  natural  disasters  that  have  not 
only  devastated  public  and  private  institutions,  but 
have also torn the socio-economic fabric of society and 
contributed to grave humanitarian crises. We appeal to 
the  world  community  to  make  generous  contributions 
and  to  work  closely  with  the  Somali  authorities  to 
ensure that humanitarian access is provided to the most 
vulnerable  populations.  Meeting  those  humanitarian 
needs will ultimately provide a strong foundation from 
which  recovery,  reconstruction  and  development  can 
emerge in the future. 

This  historical  moment  requires  bold  initiatives 
on  the  part  of  the  President  of  the  General Assembly, 
who,  in  tandem  with  the  Secretary-General,  is  called 
upon  to  provide  the  vision  and  strength  of  conviction 
necessary  to  carry  the  United  Nations  forward  to  face 
the  myriad  challenges  to  the  Organization.  We  are 
confident that, by working together closely, we can and 
shall meet the challenges ahead. 
The  President:  I  now  give  the  floor  to  His 

Excellency  Mr.  Gonzalo  Gutiérrez  Reinel,  Deputy 
Minister  and  Secretary-General  for  Foreign Affairs  of 
the Republic of Peru. 
Mr. Gutiérrez Reinel (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): 

For Peru, Sir, your election as President of the General 
Assembly  at its sixty-second session is  a guarantee of 
experience  and exceptional work.  I am  convinced that 
your  performance  will  strengthen  the  principles  of 
dialogue and coordination that guide the efforts of the 
United  Nations  to  attain  realistic  commitments  that 
contribute to well-being in the daily life of humankind. 

On 15 August, an earthquake occurred in the city 
of Pisco, seriously impacting the southern populations 
of  Peru,  claiming  priceless  human  lives  and  causing 
great  material  damage.  The  Peruvian  people  deeply 
appreciates  the  immediate  and  generous  response  of 
the  international  community,  as  well  as  the  speedy

Coordination  of  Humanitarian  Affairs.  The  Office’s 
support  showed 
that  united  action  can  make  a 
difference  in  a  crisis  situation  and  contributed  to  the 
Government’s  activities  in  attending  to  the  urgent 
needs  of  the  victims.  Our  sincere  recognition  goes  to 
the  cooperation 
is  now  being 
channelled  by  my  country’s  Fund  for  Southern 
Reconstruction. 

The  stabilization  and  growth  of  the  Peruvian 
economy  over  the  past  76  months  have  generated 
national  and  international  confidence  and  expectation. 
We are convinced that the investment and participation 
of  our  productive  forces  will  allow  us  to  maintain 
continuous  growth  and  to  exploit  the  opportunity  to 
enhance  a  model  and  national  project  of  social 
tranquillity and development. 

In  the  first  year  of  his  Government,  President  of 
the  Republic Alan  García  has  laid  the  foundations  for 
greater  dynamic  growth  in  the  country.  We  must  now 
consolidate  and  give  practical  and  positive  content  to 
the democracy, governance and economic stabilization 
of  the  country  in  order  to  allow  the  growth  indices  to 
generate national confidence and participation that can 
be  converted  into  transparency,  equity,  justice  and 
social peace. 

The  struggle  against  poverty  and  inequity  is  the 
most  formidable  current  challenge  to  the  national  and 
foreign  policies  of  Peru.  In  the  conviction  that  the 
dignity  of  human  beings  and  their  welfare  are  at  the 
core of governmental management, and that economic 
indicators  should  be  based  on  the  well-being  of  our 
population without distinction, the Government of Peru 
has  redefined  its  social  policy  through  a  concept  of 
productive 
and 
technological 
institutional 
development  and  support  for  the  population.  To  that 
end,  we  have  begun  implementing  a  national  strategy 
of  rural  development  and  a  national  strategy  of  food 
security 
to  address  chronic  child  malnutrition. 
Important  road  infrastructure  works  will  complement 
the incorporation of the Peruvian Andes and Amazonia 
into the development of the country. 

the  Millennium 
fulfilment  of 
Development  Goals,  Peru  has  set  itself  the  concrete 
goal  of  reducing  the  current  level  of  poverty  from  50 
per  cent  to  30  per  cent  by  2011.  Chronic  malnutrition 
will be reduced from 25 per cent to 16 per cent, and the

extended to 90 per cent of citizens. Likewise, we plan 
to  eradicate  illiteracy,  reduce  employment  in  the 
informal sector from 53 per cent to 35 per cent, create 
1.5 million jobs, and reduce the external debt from 24 
per cent to 13 per cent of the gross domestic product.  
The  Government’s  new  direction  in  State  action 

is 
focused  on  decentralization.  The 
strategic 
decentralization plan goes beyond the mere transfer of 
resources  or  the  execution  of  public  works  in  the 
interior of the country. The regions can now coordinate 
their own development plan, efficiently distribute more 
than  80  per  cent  of  the  national  budget,  interlink  and 
gradually  integrate  Peru  as  a  whole,  and  promote  the 
better  distribution  of 
income 
through  a  process  of  national  institutionalization  that 
supports optimal care of the environment. 

Peru has become one of the emerging countries of 
the  region  thanks  to  the  continuous  growth  of  its 
economy  over  the  past  eight  years.  Its  strategic 
location in the South American Pacific, the full force of 
a modern legal framework that  encourages investment 
and  exports,  the  diversity  of  its  natural  resources,  its 
growing  diversification  in  the  global  markets,  and  its 
political  and  macroeconomic  stability  are  factors  that 
ensure  a  development  process  of  genuine  social 
inclusion. 

the 
uncertainty  of  the  Doha  Round  negotiations  and  a 
cautious  evaluation  of  the  effective  possibilities  of 
integration in the Andean subregion and Latin America, 
Peru is striving to conclude free trade treaties with its

that  will  complement 
regional  and  subregional  integration  schemes  and

Community — comprised of Peru, Colombia, Ecuador

Likewise, Peru has entered into free-trade treaties with 
Chile and the United States, and is negotiating similar 
instruments  with  Canada  and  Mexico.  Negotiations 
with  the  Central American  countries  are  scheduled  to 
begin shortly. We have finished negotiating a free-trade 
agreement  with  Singapore,  negotiations  with Thailand 
have  reached  an  “early  harvest”  agreement,  and  we 
have begun to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the 
People’s  Republic  of  China.  Likewise,  the  negotiation 
of  an  agreement  of  association  between  the  Andean 
Community  and  the  European  Union  has  begun.  Our 
priorities  are  now  to  pursue  negotiations  with  Korea,

Our  objectives  are  clear:  to  ensure  access  to  the 
markets of our main  commercial partners; to establish 
fair  and  predictable  commercial  rules  and  regulations 
that  complement  the  standards  of  the  World  Trade 
Organization;  to  diversify  the  markets  for  our  exports 
of  goods  and  services;  and  to  attract  investment  and 
technologies  to  modernize  our  productive  structure, 
reduce  the  technology  gap,  and  modernize  Peru’s 
physical 
its 
competitiveness. 

Following  on  the  results  of  a  regressive  utopian 
experiment  in  Latin  America,  we  are  convinced  that 
Peru’s  model  of  integration  into  the  global  economy, 
while consolidating regional economic expansion, will 
allow  us  to  ensure  the  participation  of  the  large 
majority  of  our  people  in  the  system’s  benefits,  with 
concrete  improvements  in  their  daily  lives.  It  will 
thereby contribute to the people’s sense of belonging to 
their social institutions and of full citizenship, as well 
as to their perception of themselves as agents of social-
economic  change  and  to  the  consolidation  of  the 
democratic system. 

In the framework of such integration, my country 
is also assuming growing international responsibilities. 
In  our  efforts  to  foment  dialogue,  we  are  deeply 
honoured  to  be  able  to  organize  a  summit  of  heads  of 
State  and  Government  of  Latin  America  and  the 
Caribbean  and  the  European  Union,  as  well  as  the 
summit  of  the  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation 
Forum, both of which will take place in Peru in 2008. 

Formidable technological advances, especially in 
the  information  field;  the  emergence  of  new  powers; 
energy  insecurity;  climate  change;  growing  inequity 
and  poverty;  and  new  challenges  to  international 
security  characterize  a  changing  and  ever-more 
complex  international  scene  to  which  States  and 
international  institutions  must  adapt.  Global  society  is

In this complicated scenario, Peru is participating 

in

in  peacekeeping 
operations.  The  Peruvian  armed  forces  are  present  in 
the  Sudan,  the  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo, 
Ethiopia and Eritrea, Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire and Haiti. 

Peru  attaches  special  importance  to  cooperation 
with Haiti, having assumed in January the coordination 
of  the  Group  of  Friends  of  Haiti  in  the  Security

Council. In that regard, we support the renewal of the 
mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in 
Haiti  (MINUSTAH)  for  a  year,  as  well  as  the  gradual 
reorientation  of  its  work  to  promote  development,  in 
support  of  its  multidisciplinary  and  multidimensional 
work. At  present,  we  are  contributing  a  contingent  of 
Peruvian military officers, which we expect to be able 
to complement shortly with an engineering corps. 

Our  permanent  representation  in  New  York  has 
presented  a  draft  resolution  that,  inter  alia,  reaffirms 
the  urgent  call  to  fulfil  the  contribution  pledges, 
pursuant  to  the  priorities  presented  by  the  Haitian 
Government,  especially  for  cooperation  projects  to 
eradicate  poverty,  improve  basic  health  services  and 
strengthen  national  institutions.  We  expect  the  draft 
resolution  to  enjoy  consensus  in  the  Security  Council 
so  that  the  international  contribution  to  Haiti  can 
continue. 

Last  May,  Peru,  with  the  cooperation  of  Norway 
and  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme, 
organized  the  Lima  Conference  on  Cluster  Munitions, 
assuming a lead regional role in the endorsement of the 
Oslo Process. At the Conference, Peru presented to the 
69 delegations of the participating countries a proposal 
to secure a declaration of the Latin-American region as 
free  of  cluster  munitions,  which  have

the  final  stages  of  preparing  a  national  plan  of  action 
against anti-personnel mines with a view to completing 
the  demining  process  along  our  northern  frontier,  in 
cooperation with the brotherly country of Ecuador.  

Moreover,  Peru  is  firmly  committed  to  efforts  to 
attain complete disarmament and the non-proliferation 
of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as 
their  delivery  systems,  which  constitute  a  threat  to 
international  peace  and  security.  In  that  respect,  we 
support  the  strengthening  and  universalization  of  the 
relevant  binding  multilateral  agreements.  In 
that 
context,  Peru  organized  a  regional  seminar  on  the

The General Assembly is the forum in which the 
middle-income  countries  can  efficiently  contribute  to 
identifying imaginative responses to conflicts and new 
threats. That  is why we resolutely support reform that 
will  strengthen  the Assembly  and  ensure  its  ability  to

international  agenda.

International  reality  presents  many  challenges  to 
the  universal  system  for  promoting  and  protecting 
human  rights.  There  is  still  a  dichotomy  between 
security and individual rights, with a backdrop marked 
by  the  poverty  and  the  inequality  in  which  the  great 
majority around the world live and which affect human 
dignity.  The  new  Human  Rights  Council  and  the 
system integrated into it ought to help in the response 
to these challenges.

multilateral  and  worldwide  commitment.  Through 
sustainable forest management, Peru has contributed to 
the  global  commitment  by  reducing  emissions  caused 
by  deforestation.  We  have  also  made  headway  in 
implementing  our  National  Strategy  on  Climate 
Change  by  strengthening  national  capacities 
to 
maximize  human  and  financial  resources.  The  size  of 
the  problem  requires  an  agreement  with  goals  for  the

2009.

my  country  because  the  potato  has  its  origin  in  Peru, 
and it is the country with the greatest genetic diversity 
of  this  product.  The  cultivation  of  the  potato  was 
developed  in  ancient  times  by  civilizations  that  gave 
rise  to  the  Peru  of  today  and  is  one  of  the  great 
contributions  to  the  world’s  diet.  Peru  has  proclaimed 
2008  as  the  National  Year  of  the  Potato  and  has 
developed  a  calendar  of  multisectoral  activities  for 
outreach  and 
that  will  be  a  positive 
contribution  to  the  work  programme  of  the  Food  and

I  shall  conclude  by  noting  that  Peru  participates 
actively  to  ensure  and  strengthen  the  United  Nations 
Charter  principles  and  objectives  of  peace,  peaceful 
coexistence  and  development,  especially 
the 
Security  Council  and  the  Human  Rights  Council.  In

The  President:  I  now  give  the  floor  to  His 

Excellency  Mr. Yannis  Valinakis,  Deputy  Minister  for 
Foreign Affairs of the of the Hellenic Republic. 
Mr.  Valinakis  (Greece)  (spoke  in  French):  The 

great  challenges  and  problems,  both  global  and 
regional,  call  for  urgent  and  coherent  responses.  The 
responsibilities  and  the  role  of  the  United  Nations  in 
raising  awareness  and  in  providing  unity  of  direction 
are  now  greater  and  more  important.  That  is  exactly 
why  compliance  with  United  Nations  resolutions 
should  be  a  top  priority  for  all,  including  those  are 
elected to represent the Organization and its agencies.  

I  should  like  to  congratulate  Her  Excellency 
Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa — who was only the 
third  woman  in  the  history  of  the  United  Nations  to 
occupy  the  post  of  President  of  this  Assembly  —  on 
her  efforts  to  promote  the  purpose  and  principles  for 
which our Organization was founded. 
I  should  also  like  to  express  our  appreciation  to

keeping alive the authority and role of the Organization 
in this area. 

Greece fully aligns itself with the statement made 
by  the  Prime  Minister  of  Portugal  on  behalf  of  the 
European Union. However, we would like to add a few 
points  about  the  major  issues  on  our  agenda  for  the 
coming period. 
(spoke in English) 

The end of the Cold War ushered in a new era in 
international  relations  in  which  the  threat  of  military 
confrontation between the two power blocs dissipated. 
However,  the  world  community  still  faces  violent 
internal conflicts, civil wars, genocide and other large-
scale  atrocities  that  cause  immense  destruction  and 
suffering to millions of people. 

And  yet,  conflicts  within  and  between  States  are 
not the only threat to international peace and security. 
New threats and challenges are emerging. Proliferation 
of weapons of mass destruction is a serious challenge. 
Organized  crime  and  human  trafficking  constitute 
another  threat  that  can  have  destabilizing  effects  and 
fuel  civil  wars.  Extreme  poverty  in  many  parts  of  the 
world, 
humanitarian 
disasters, deadly infectious diseases and environmental 
degradation 
catastrophes  have  devastating 
consequences. 

We  applaud  the  Secretary-General’s  initiative  to 
hold a high-level  event last week to  deal with climate 
change,  environmental  issues  being  potentially  the 
greatest  threat  to  our  societies.  I  hope  that  a  global, 
sustained  and  comprehensive  approach  emerges  soon 
to  help  save  our  planet,  our  future,  our  children’s 
future. 
Controlling  and  coping  with  climate  change  is 

one  of  the  greatest  environmental  and  development 
challenges.  Without  swift  action  to  face  the  problems 
arising from these challenges, we all risk paying a high 
and bitter price.  We should proceed in a timely manner, 
through  a  step-by-step  approach,  building  on  national 
as  well  as  international  capacities  in  order  to  address 
the  causes,  mitigate  the  effects  and  create  synergies 
that  will  allow  for  specific  and  measurable  results  in 
the  near  future.  A  clear  indication  of  the  importance 
Greece attaches to the environment is the fact that the

has  decided  to  focus  on  climate  change  and  human 
security. 
failing  States, 
large-scale 
and 
the 
international  community, 

This  summer  my  country  suffered  enormously 
from devastating wildfires. May I take this opportunity, 
while  addressing 
to 
express  our  deep  gratitude  and  thanks  to  all  those 
countries  and  friends  who  have  extended  to  us  their 
invaluable support, help and assistance. 

Working for peace is not an easy task. The pursuit 
of  international  peace  and  stability,  if  it  is  to  be 
successful, means that threats have to be addressed in a 
comprehensive  way  and  that  many  conditions  have  to 
be  met.  Unresolved  conflicts  have  to  be  energetically 
confronted,  while,  at  the  same  time,  we  have  to  deal 
with  situations  of  deep-seated  injustice,  inequality, 
ongoing  violence,  social  exclusion,  extreme  poverty, 
famine, illiteracy and cultural misunderstanding. 

In addressing the deep-rooted structural problems 
that  fuel  conflicts,  peacebuilding  must  bridge  security 
and  development.  Good  governance,  the  rule  of  law, 
strong democratic institutions, respect for human rights 
and development assistance are critical components in 
reducing today’s conflicts. 

Terrorism  is  undeniably  one  of  the  most  serious 
threats  to  peace  and  security,  menacing  the  very 
foundation  of our democratic societies, and actions to 
combat  this  threat  should  be  in  conformity  with 
international  human  rights  standards  and  fundamental 
freedoms.  The  adoption  of 
the  Global  Counter-
Terrorism  Strategy  by  the  General  Assembly  was  a 
major  accomplishment,  and  its  full  implementation 
should  be  an  absolute  priority  for  Member  States.  In 
this respect, I would like to emphasize the importance 
that my country attaches to the conclusion of ongoing 
negotiations  for  the  elaboration  of  a  comprehensive 
convention against international terrorism; it would be 
a  valuable  addition  to  the  counter-terrorism  legal 
framework. 
In  the  face  of  all  the  threats  and  challenges  that

peace and security. Integrated and long-term strategies 
to address the root causes of conflict are necessary. The 
United Nations should therefore be strengthened in its 
managing, resolving and preventing conflicts and their 
recurrence. International regional organizations should 
also  be  effective  in  this  regard,  and  international 
treaties should be respected. 

The  United  Nations  was  created  on  the  basis  of 
the  resolve  of  all  States  that  collective  action  was  the 
only basis for taking measures to address our common 
global  problems.  We  only  have  common  values 
enshrined in the United Nations Charter that guide our 
efforts  and  give  us  direction  to  unite  around  what  is 
just  and  right  —  freedom,  democracy,  human  rights, 
equality,  peaceful  resolution  of  conflicts,  respect, 
multiculturalism,  tolerance  and  open  societies,  and 
dialogue  among  neighbours,  nations,  religions  and 
cultures. Greece’s foreign and security policy is based 
precisely  on  these  principles  and  values.  We  are 
committed  to  the  peaceful  settlement  of  disputes,  the 
upholding  of  international  law,  including  international 
humanitarian  law,  and  promoting  good  neighbourly 
relations. 

I  deeply  regret  to  note  that,  33  years  after  the 
Turkish  invasion  in  1974,  the  Republic  of  Cyprus 
remains  a  divided  island.  Turkey  continues  to  occupy 
part  of  a  United  Nations  and  European  Union  (EU) 
Member  State  with  over  40,000  troops,  violating 
United  Nations  resolutions  and  international  law.  Our 
steadfast  objective  remains  the  withdrawal  of  all 
occupation troops and the reunification of the island, in 
the  context  of  a  bizonal,  bicommunal  federation.  To 
this  end,  the  relevant  United  Nations  resolutions  and 
the  EU  principles  and  values  provide  a  clear 
framework for a comprehensive settlement agreed upon 
by the two communities. 

Greece  has  consistently  welcomed  the  United 
Nations initiatives for finding a just and viable solution 
to  the  Cyprus  question.  In  this  vein,  we  strongly 
support  the  rapid  implementation  of  the  8  July  2006 
agreement,  which  was  reached  under  United  Nations 
auspices.  We  shall  continue  to  do  everything  possible 
to  assist  the  two  communities  to  find  an  agreed 
solution,  not  least  because  it  would  significantly 
enhance the development of friendship and cooperation 
between  Greece  and Turkey. We  strongly  urge Turkey 
to  demonstrate  the  necessary  will  and  flexibility 
towards this direction.

Our  foreign  policy  is  based  on  the  principles  of

in  this  spirit  that  we  approach  our  relations  with

and

Lately, it has grown even further in the economic field, 
but  also  in  the  energy  sector.  We  believe  that  a

In  any  case,  from  the  outset  Greece  has  repeatedly 
stated that Turkey’s full compliance should lead to full 
membership. 

Good  neighbourly  relations  are  the  cornerstone 
upon  which  the  countries  of  South-East  Europe  must 
build a common European future of peace, stability and 
prosperity.  The  European  perspective  of  the  countries 
of  our  region  has  been  a  strategic  choice  for  Greece. 
Our  vision  is  to  transform  our  neighbourhood  into  a 
region  that  is  like  the  rest  of  Europe  —  an  area  of 
peace, democracy and prosperity. As the oldest member 
of the EU and NATO in the region, my country works

Our  efforts  to  secure  a  truly  European  future  for 
the Balkans will remain inconclusive if we fail to reach 
a viable and sustainable settlement for Kosovo’s future 
status. We remain convinced that this goal can be met 
only  if,  first,  effective  compromises  between  the  two 
parties  are  achieved  in  the  course  of  the  ongoing 
negotiations  and,  secondly, 
is 
legitimized  through  a  Security  Council  resolution.  In 
any  case,  this  is  par  excellence  a  European  problem, 
and  the  role  of  the  European  Union  in  this  issue  is 
essential. 

I  cannot  think  of  any  conflict  that  has  held  the 
unwavering attention of so many for so long as the one 
in 
the 
multifaceted challenges that we face in this part of the 
world.  And  we  all  agree  that  the  nature  of  these 
challenges is such that they affect not only the peoples 
of  the  region,  but  the  entire  international  community. 
Despite the variances that we observe among us, there 
is one crucial element that is common to all, and that is 
the  need  to  achieve  a  just  and  lasting  peace  in  the 
Middle  East  based  on  a  two-State  solution  that  will 
guarantee security, mutual respect and a fair future for 
all.  This  is  our  common  goal,  and  Greece  is  deeply 
committed to it. 
The  progress  Africa  has  been  making  in  recent 

years 
is 
characterized  by  economic  growth,  crisis  management 
and a will for conflict prevention. The United Nations, 
deeply 
in  peacekeeping  and  providing 
developmental  assistance,  has  found  in  the  African 
Union  and  the  African  regional  organizations  a  vital 
partner  for  the  success  of  this  process.  Partnership 
between the United Nations and the African Union, as 
well  as  the African  regional  organizations,  could  well 
be  the  key  to  successfully  overcoming  the  challenges 
facing  Africa  today.  In  this  context,  we  welcome  the 
creation  of  the  joint  African  Union/United  Nations 
Hybrid  Operation  in  Darfur  (UNAMID),  which,  by 
combining  forces  of  the  United  Nations  and  of  the 
African Union, shows the way to the future for Darfur 
and for the continent as a whole. 

International  development  cooperation  is  one  of 
the  priorities  of  Greek  foreign  policy.  Our  national 
development  agency,  Hellenic  Aid,  implements  the 
United Nations Millennium Development Goals in the 
framework  set  out  by  the  European  Union  and  the

benefit  of  our  partner  countries  in  the  developing 
world. In Africa, development assistance, ranging from 
humanitarian  aid  to  HIV/AIDS  care  and  refugee 
programmes, was offered to almost 20 African States. 
On all the issues I have referred to, my country is

opportunity  to  express  our  strong  support  for  the 
people  of  Burma  in  their  struggle  for  a  democratic 
future.  We  strongly  urge  the  Burmese  Government  to 
initiate  a  peaceful  dialogue,  resist  all  violence  and 
respect  the  human  rights  of  the  Burmese  people,  not 
least their freedom of expression and assembly. 
There  is  little  doubt  —  and  this  has  been 

highlighted by all speakers during the last few days — 
that  we,  the  international  community,  the  United 
Nations,  face  major  challenges  in  the  years  ahead. 
When addressing them, we should also be aware of the 
progress that has been achieved in the world in recent 
decades. 

The accelerated globalization process has brought 
enormous  benefits  to  many  hundreds  of  millions  of 
people,  not  least  in  the  emerging  economies.  Today, 
nearly  a  third  of  the  world’s  population  live  in 
countries where economic growth is about 10 per cent 
a  year,  and  we  seem  to  be  well  on  our  way  towards 
meeting 
the  Millennium 
Development Goals that will reduce by half the number 
of people living in absolute poverty around the world. 
(Sweden):  Let  me

From  a  historical  perspective,  that  is  amazing 
progress. Never before in human history have so many 
been  lifted  out  of  absolute  poverty  in  such  a  short 
space  of  time.  There  is  no  room  for  complacency, 
however. We must make globalization a force for good, 
for open societies, open economies and an open world 
for  everyone  on  our  planet.  We  must  redouble  our 
efforts  to  bring  the  Doha  Development  Round  to  a 
successful conclusion. Sustainable economic growth, a 
vibrant  private  sector  and  a  more  open  international 
trading  system  are  needed  if  we  are  to  achieve  the 
goals we have set for eradicating poverty in the world. 

Aid  for  trade  is  a  crucial  complement  to  the 
opening  up  of  markets  for  many  countries.  The 
developing  countries  of  the  world  represent  far  too 
small  a  share  of  world  trade.  We  must  live  up  to  the 
international  commitments  on  development  assistance 
and  ensure  that  development  cooperation  becomes 
more  efficient.  That  is  the  joint  responsibility  of  all 
donors  and  all  partner  countries.  The  Swedish 
Government  has  initiated  extensive  reforms  aimed  at 
creating a new Swedish development assistance policy 
characterized by quality, efficiency and results in terms 
of reduced poverty and more democratic societies. We 
must  now  —  as  was  highlighted 
last  week  — 
accelerate  our  efforts  to  address  the  challenge  of 
climate  change.  The  Swedish  Government  has 
launched  a  Commission  on  Climate  Change  and 
Development to address risk reduction, adaptation and 
climate-proofing  development.  We  must  make  a 
dedicated  mutual  effort 
the  Millennium 
Development  Goals.  The  fact  that  we  are  making 
substantial  progress  on  all  of 
them  globally 
demonstrates that progress is indeed possible. 

Human rights, security and development go hand 
in  hand.  Respect  for  human  rights  is  necessary  to 
achieve  security  and  development,  and  those  three 
elements  are  mutually  reinforcing.  Our  protection  of 
any  individual  anywhere  is  the  protection  of  all 
individuals everywhere. 

The death penalty must be abolished all over the 
world. It contravenes the very notion of human rights. 
Even in that area, the world is making progress, but 25 
countries  still  sentence  people  to  death.  Six  countries 
are  responsible  for  more  than  90  per  cent  of  all 
executions  worldwide. We  all  know  who  they  are  and 
expect them to take steps to abolish the death penalty.

the  present 

The  links  between  security  and  development, 
including  the  need  to  combine  State-building  efforts 
and  peace-support  operations  for  long-lasting  results, 
place  new  demands  on  the  international  community. 
The  United  Nations  must  learn  from  and  build  on  the 
recent  experiences  of  a  number  of  challenging  but 
successful  large-scale  missions  that  integrate  military 
and  civilian  components.  We  need 
improve 
coordination  of  international  efforts  in  the  field,  for 
instance in Afghanistan. 

There  are  many  challenges  that  remain  to  be 
tackled  if  we  are  to  make  the  world  a  better  place. 
Perhaps  the  most  important  is  how  we  should  best 
address 
the  existing  non-
proliferation  regime.  Were  there  to  be  one  new  State 
with nuclear weapons, the danger is that another would 
soon follow. Shortly, those weapons might well be out 
of  any  State’s  control.  The  risk  of  nuclear  terrorism 
would be a very real one. That must be prevented. Our 
children deserve to live in a world safe from the threat 
of  nuclear  war  and  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction 
falling  into  the  hands  of  terrorists.  Those  weapons 
threaten the very existence of mankind. 

To prevent that, the nuclear Powers have a duty to 
live up to their responsibilities. To neglect is to invite 
failure.  They  need  to  demonstrate  their  readiness  to 
substantially  reduce 
their  nuclear  arsenals.  Those 
weapons are of no use in deterring the adversaries we 
might face if the non-proliferation regime is eroded or 
collapses.  It  is  a  question  of  self-interest  and  far-
sighted statesmanship. 

But  we  must  also  address  the  urgent  political 
issues  that  we  are  confronted  with.  Although  the 
numbers  of  wars  and  conflicts  have  continued  to 
decline, we should be acutely aware of the dangers of 
conflicts 
together  and 
unravelling the progress we have seen. Let me address 
two  of  those:  the  situation  in  the  Middle  East  and  the 
conflicts in Africa. 

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has to end with a 
peaceful settlement negotiated by the parties, resulting 
in  the  emergence  of  an  independent,  democratic  and 
viable Palestinian State living side by side in peace and 
security  with  Israel  and  other  neighbours.  Restoring 
peace and economic growth in the Middle East requires 
parallel  action  by  the  Israelis  and  the  Palestinians. 
Nothing is more important for the long-term security of 
Israel  than  the  creation  of  a  truly  viable  Palestinian 
rapidly  exploding,

State.  That  will  require  freedom  of  movement  and 
access  to  be  significantly  improved  in  the  West  Bank 
and Gaza. Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas 
recognize  each  other  as  partners  for  peace.  That 
provides  an  opening  that  we  should  all  do  our  utmost 
to support. 

It is therefore now time for a true peace process, 
and  not  of  the  incremental  sort  that  has  been  tried  so 
many times before. It is now time to achieve the peace 
that  is  the  common  aspiration  of  the  vast  majority  of 
Israelis  and  Palestinians  alike,  as  well  as  of  the 
international community. 

We  urge  the  leaders  of  Israel  and  Palestine  to 
move  forward  towards  a  comprehensive  settlement. 
The  international  meeting  this  autumn  is  of  crucial 
importance. But the challenges of the Middle East are 
not limited to that conflict.  

We  are  convinced  that  we  must  do  more  to 
encourage  reconciliation  and  reconstruction  in  Iraq 
after the horrible brutalities of the last few decades. We 
must do much more to assist and protect the more than 
4 million Iraqis who have left their homes.  

Iran  still  refuses  to  accept  the  obligations  laid 
down by the Security Council. Iran has to convince us 
of the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. 

The  conflicts  on  the  Horn  of  Africa,  stretching 
from Ethiopia and Eritrea to Somalia, the Sudan, Chad 
and  the  Central  African  Republic,  cause  thousands 
upon  thousands  of  deaths  as  well  as  untold  human 
suffering  for  the  survivors.  National  leaders  on  the 
Horn should rise to the challenge and demonstrate their 
commitment to peace and reconciliation. The failure of 
Ethiopia 
quite 
straightforward  demarcation  of  their  common  border, 
eight  years  after  their  commitment  to  do  so,  is  a 
worrying  signal,  not  only  for  these  two  countries,  but 
also for the region as a whole. 

In  the  Sudan,  a  process  of  democratization  is  of 
paramount importance to tackle the core problems and 
to achieve reconciliation. We must focus on support for 
the 
the  Comprehensive  Peace 
Agreement  as  well  as  the  renewed  peace  effort  for 
Darfur that will take place in Tripoli at the end of the 
month.

Challenges  like  these  show  the  urgent  need  for 
world  leaders  to  accept  shared  responsibility  for  our 
common  future.  Sweden  addresses  these  challenges  in 
close  cooperation  with  its  European  Union  partners. 
We  need  a  strong  —  and  reformed  —  United  Nations 
to  bring  us  all  together.  A  better  world  is  within  our 
reach. 

Excellency  Mr.  Carsten  Staur,  chairman  of 
delegation of the Kingdom of Denmark. 
Mr. Staur (Denmark): At the Millennium Summit 

in  2000,  an  unprecedented  number  of  world  leaders 
came 
to  an 
ambitious  global  agenda  for  the  years  ahead.  This 
agenda  was  further  reinforced  at  the  2005  World 
Summit,  where  we  also  adopted  the  far-reaching 
principle of responsibility to protect. 

By the very nature of the commitments from the 
Millennium Declaration and the World Summit, it was 
globally  recognized  that  there  can  be  no  development 
without  security  and  human  rights  —  and  vice  versa. 
We owe it to ourselves and to the world community to 
take  stock  of  our  progress.  How  well,  then,  have  we 
met this challenge so far? 

At the institutional level, there can be no question 
that 
important  progress  has  been  achieved,  as 
witnessed  by 
the  Central 
Emergency  Response  Fund, 
the  Peacebuilding 
Commission  and  the  Human  Rights  Council.  But 
institution-building alone will not do. We need to show 
the  necessary  resolve  to  make  these  new  institutions 
effective  instruments  in  the  service  of  the  global 
community.  We  have  achieved  little  if  we  do  not 
endeavour  to  ensure  that  they  fulfil  their  stated 
purposes and that they realize their true potential. Our

challenge now is to address the substantive issues and 
to do so in earnest. 
As  we  cross 
towards  2015, 
substantial progress has been made  at the global level 
towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs). The results achieved through market-oriented 
economic  reform  in Asia  and  Latin America  over  the 
past decade prove that eradication of poverty is not an 
elusive, unattainable goal. 

But,  again,  there  is  no  room  for  complacency. A 
substantial increase in efforts is still needed, especially 
if  sub-Saharan  Africa  is  to  meet  the  Millennium 
Development  Goals  by  2015.  The  facts  are  quite 
simple. If progress in Africa is not accelerated, we will 
not live up to our responsibility. Denmark believes that 
the time has come to arrange a United Nations summit 
focusing  on  the  progress  towards  the  Millennium 
Development Goals and on financing for development. 

the  heart  of  Danish 
development  assistance.  The  Danish  Government 
firmly  believes  that  development  assistance  to  Africa 
should  increase. We  need  to  live  up  to  the  promise  to 
double aid for Africa by 2010. Denmark is keeping its 
part of the bargain. We are committed to providing 0.8 
per  cent  of  our  national  income  in  development 
assistance.  Two  thirds  of  our  bilateral  assistance  will 
go to the African continent. 
But  clearly,  development  assistance  alone  is  not 

to 
enough.  Trade  and  good  governance 
development.  There 
is  no  substitute  for  national 
ownership  and  for  national  commitment  to  good 
governance  or  for  transparent  and  liberal  trade  and 
investment  regimes  that  allow  developing  countries  to 
benefit from globalization. 

It  is  a  key  goal  for  the  Danish  Government  to 
promote  good  governance,  democracy  and  human 
rights  with  no  impunity  for  crimes  against  humanity 
and  we  will  do  this  through  an  active  foreign  policy. 
Denmark  will  seriously  do  its  best  to  contribute  to  a 
more  effective  United  Nations  and  to  assist  countries 
that have a strong commitment to development but lack 
the necessary resources. 

Climate  change  has  undoubtedly  become  one  of 
the  most  urgent  global  challenges  of  our  times,  one 
that,  by  its  very  definition,  must  be  dealt  with  on  a 
truly  global  level.  Climate  change  will  affect  the

fifteenth 
Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Climate 
Change, to be held in December 2009. We have already 
commenced  the  preparations  for  the  conference.  Our 
ambitions  are  high.  We  must  reach  consensus  on  an 
effective  and  multilateral  post-Kyoto  agreement.  The 
Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen is the last 
call if the agreement is to enter into force by 2012. 

the  Secretary-General  for  his 
leadership  on  this  issue.  In  our  view,  an  inclusive 
United Nations-based multilateral approach is crucial if 
we are to bring all parties together in responding to the 
global climate challenge. 

The  High-level  Event  on  Climate  Change  held 
here in New York last week was an illustration of this 
commitment. I want to echo two essential points made 
at the High-level Event that were also taken up by the 
Secretary-General  in  his  conclusions.  First,  I  would 
note that the Conference of the Parties to take place in 
Bali next December represents a crucial cut-off date. If 
we  are  serious  about  fighting  climate  change,  the 
thirteenth Conference of the Parties to the Convention 
on  Climate  Change  in  Bali  must  define  a  clear 
timetable  for  negotiations  towards  a  comprehensive 
post-2012  framework.  Secondly,  I  would  note  that  the 
United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate 
Change

framework  for  truly  global  negotiations  on  climate 
change.  It  is  within  the  UNFCCC  that  an  ambitious 
agreement must be reached to reduce global emissions 
and to counter climate change. 
to  which 

Denmark  attaches  great  importance  is  to  obtain  equal 
opportunities  for  women.  Here,  we  also  see  a  crucial 
role  for  an  effective  United  Nations  where  gender 
equality is dealt with in a strengthened and systematic 
way,  especially  at  the  country  level.  In  our  view,  no 
one  should  be  excluded  from  contributing  to  peace, 
freedom  and  development. 
therefore,  of 
paramount  importance  —  as  a  judicial,  moral  and 
ethical  responsibility  —  that  women  everywhere  have 
the  same  opportunities  as  men.  In  the  fight  against 
poverty, it is  an absolute necessity. Women must have 
equal rights as well as full access to employment, land 
and  financial  resources.  Only  then  can  development

assistance  realize  its  true  potential  and  poverty  be 
alleviated. 

Donors must actively support partner countries in 
achieving  gender  equality.  In 
the  coming  years, 
Denmark will have a strong focus on women and their 
role  in  development  and  conflict  resolution  —  setting 
goals,  earmarking  funds  and  monitoring  progress  to 
ensure that policies create results.  

Making  a  difference  in  that  respect  will  require 
leadership from all parties. Without addressing the role 
of  women,  we  will  never  manage  to  halve  extreme 
poverty by 2015. And our efforts to support the rights 
and  empowerment  of  women  must  be  complemented 
by a targeted effort to promote sexual and reproductive 
health and rights. 

As  we  stand  here  today,  we  face  more  global 
challenges  than  ever  before.  The  world  faces  many 
unresolved  conflicts,  not  least  in  Africa.  We  need  to 
stay  focused  and 
the  Organization’s 
capacity  in  conflict  prevention,  conflict  management 
and peacebuilding. 

A strong United Nations is required to cope with 
the  global  challenges  of  today  and  tomorrow.  Only  a 
strong  and  effective  United  Nations  can  show  the 
necessary  political 
to 
development, humanitarian crisis and conflicts. 

In  the  Sudan,  we  have  an  obligation  to  help  the 
people of Darfur achieve peace through the restoration 
of  stability.  The  killings,  violence  and  atrocities  must 
end. This  has  taken  far  too  long. There  is  now  finally 
some progress in the attempts to find a solution to the 
conflict  in  Darfur,  and  we  have  a  responsibility  to 
ensure 
implemented.  Denmark  actively 
supports  the  African  Union-United  Nations  Hybrid 
Operation  in  Darfur  as  well  as  the  resumed  political 
process.  It  raises  real  hope  for  improvement  in  the 
deplorable situation on the ground and in the prospects 
for  a  long-term  political  solution.  As  part  of  this 
process, we must implement the arrest warrants of the 
International  Criminal  Court  and  bring  perpetrators  of 
crime to justice. 

Afghanistan  must  be  one  of  the  top  priorities  of 
the international community and of the United Nations. 
It is important to maintain broad consensus among all 
international  partners  regarding  the  need  to  carry 
through what we have started. To that end, we need the 
United Nations to play a stronger role in Afghanistan.

its 
full  potential 
to  coordinate 
A  coordinated  engagement  —  civilian  as  well  as 
military  —  is  a  precondition  for  success.  The  United 
Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) 
must  use 
the 
international  efforts  and  as  a  counterpart  to  the 
Afghans. And UNAMA should be present in each and 
every province, including in the south. 

In  Kosovo,  only  a  solution  to  the  final-status 
issue will ensure stability and prosperity in the region. 
We share the opinion of the Secretary-General that the 
status quo is not sustainable. We hope for results in the 
new  negotiations.  As  stated  by  the  presidency  of  the 
European  Union  (EU),  the  EU  will  live  up  to  its 
particular responsibility and participate  actively in the 
collective  effort  to  bring  the  parties  closer  together. 
The goal is to obtain a comprehensive political solution 
that will lead to a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo. 

We also believe that the United Nations continues 
to  be  an  international  focal  point  for  our  common 
efforts  in  the  fight  against  terrorism.  Last  year’s 
adoption  by  the  General  Assembly  of  the  United 
Nations  Global  Counter-Terrorism  Strategy  was  of 
crucial importance. It underlined the firm commitment 
of the international community to stand united against 
those  who  wish  to  threaten  international  peace  and 
security.  The  next  step  should  be  to  finalize  the 
negotiations  on  a  draft  comprehensive  convention  on 
international terrorism. That would send another strong 
political  signal  of  our  unity.  Adoption  of 
the 
convention  would  be  a  worthy  achievement  of  the 
sixty-second session of the General Assembly. 
Finally, let me say a few words on United Nations 

reform  and 
the 
Organization. The starting point is clear: to ensure the 
necessary  reforms  of  the  United  Nations,  there  is  no 
substitute  for  strong  political  will  on  the  part  of 
individual Member States. 

Reforms  of  United  Nations  operational  activities 
are  taking  shape.  However,  much  work  remains  to  be 
done  if  the  recommendations  of  the  High-level  Panel 
are to be followed and if the United Nations is truly to 
deliver as one. It is of paramount importance to make 
the  United  Nations  more  focused  and  effective  at  the 
country level. Experiences from the pilot countries are 
encouraging and should inspire further action. 

The  Organization’s  governance  structures  also 
require  further  reform.  The  General  Assembly  should 
keep its focus on decision-making regarding important 
institutional  challenge

The  Security  Council  would  benefit  from  reform  that 
makes  it  more  representative.  Denmark  is  therefore 
encouraged  by  the  new  momentum  in  discussions  on 
Security Council reform. 

But, first and foremost, strengthening the United 
Nations  requires  an  understanding  that  the  United 
Nations cannot do everything for everyone at the same 
time.  We  need  to  agree  on  a  common  vision  and  on 
priorities for the Organization. We need to take a step 
back from the day-to-day agenda and focus on the role 
that a strong United Nations could play in the future — 
which points towards strengthening the United Nations 
in relation to three of its unique features.

should help to build up States and to ensure that weak 
States  do  not  fall  back  into  conflict  or  chaos.  The 
Peacebuilding  Commission  will  be  essential  in  this 
regard.  

Thirdly  and  finally,  in  the  area  of  international 
norm-setting,  where  the  United  Nations  has  already 
shaped  the  international  agenda  for  action,  one  of  the 
goals  should  be  to  enhance  the  role  played  by  the 
Organization  in  ensuring  respect  for  human  rights. As 
Members of the United Nations, we have taken on the 
shared  responsibility  of  protecting  those  in  the  most 
vulnerable situations, not least children. 

What  is  needed  now  is  to  follow  through  and  to 
catalyse action. That is no small task, even for a strong 
United Nations. 

Robert Hill, chairman of the delegation of Australia.

would  also  like  to  wish  His  Excellency  Mr.  Ban  Ki-
moon well for this, his first full session of the General 
Assembly as Secretary-General.  

On  behalf  of  the Australian  Government,  let  me 
begin by  reaffirming Australia’s long-standing  call  for 
reform  of  the  United  Nations.  Australia  strongly 
supports  efforts 
the  Organization  more 
effective.  And  Australia  would  like  to  acknowledge 
Secretary-General Ban’s push for reform so far. 

But reform of the United Nations is not an end in 
itself. We must reform the United Nations so that it can 
act  decisively  to  meet  global  challenges.  Simply 
talking about issues does not solve problems. 

Over the past 60 years, when the United Nations 
has  acted  it  has  proved  its  worth.  United  Nations 
peacekeeping  operations  around  the  world  have  saved 
lives  and  helped  communities  rebuild. Australia  has  a 
proud  history  of  supporting  them.  Australia  was  the 
first  country  on  the  ground  in  what  was  arguably  the 
first-ever  United  Nations  peacekeeping  operation,  the 
1947 Consular Commission to Indonesia. In the past 60 
years,  Australia  has  made  contributions  to  39  United 
Nations peacekeeping operations, and we continue that 
tradition today. 

The  United  Nations,  as  the  only  Organization 
with  a  truly  global  membership,  has  both  a  unique 
opportunity  to  meet  challenges  and  a  responsibility  to 
take action. By coming together, we can achieve more 
than  each  of  our  countries  could  on  its  own.  The 
United Nations has great moral authority. But, if it fails 
to act decisively, that authority will be squandered. 

As  Members  of  the  United  Nations,  we  have  set 
ourselves  important  goals  over  the  past  62  years: 
maintaining  global  peace  and  security,  supporting 
economic  and  social  development  and  advancing 
human  rights.  In  2005,  we  pledged  to  protect  those 
people who are most vulnerable: those facing genocide, 
war  crimes  and  crimes  against  humanity.  We 
recognized  the  responsibility  to  protect  as  a  central 
tenet of our shared humanity.  

This responsibility to protect underpins the notion 
that  States  must  protect  their  own  populations.  But,  if 
they should fail to do so, the international community 
has  a  responsibility  to  act,  not  to  stand  idly  by  in  the 
face of atrocities, genocide or ethnic cleansing. For the 
international  community,  that  means  we  must  commit 
to prevent — and respond to — these most serious of

crimes, wherever they occur. After the immediate crisis 
has  passed,  we  must  support  recovery  efforts  to  help 
communities  rebuild  and  reconcile,  by  addressing  the 
causes of the crisis. 

Last  year,  the  Security  Council  drew  upon  the 
responsibility to protect for the first time in a country-
specific resolution: resolution 1706 (2006), on Darfur. 
And, under a subsequent resolution, an African Union-
United  Nations  hybrid  peacekeeping  operation  was 
established,  with  a  robust  mandate  to  protect  civilians 
and 
international 
community  must  now  ensure  that  the  deployment  of 
the Hybrid  force proceeds  quickly. Active cooperation 
is needed across the international community if we are 
to  keep  our  promise  to  the  people  of  Darfur.  The 
alternative — to fail — is unthinkable. This is a test for 
the United Nations and its Member States. 

But  resolving  the  tragedy  in  Darfur  is,  first  and 
foremost, a test for the Government of Sudan and other 
parties to the conflict. Ongoing military operations  by 
the  Government  of  Sudan,  and  last  weekend’s  killing 
and abduction of African Union peacekeepers by rebel 
forces,  demonstrate  the  urgent  need  for  the  parties  to 
stop  these  crimes  and  build  peace.  Those  who  have 
committed crimes in Darfur must be punished. 

Australia calls on the Government of Sudan to act 
on  the  warrants  issued  by  the  International  Criminal 
Court. We call on Sudan to arrest those accused and to 
hand them over to the Court. 

Darfur  is  not  the  only  humanitarian  crisis  we 
have  experienced  or  will  face  in  the  United  Nations. 
Tragically,  other  populations  will  also 
require 
protection 
from  crimes  against  humanity.  The 
responsibility  to  protect  provides  the  necessary  guide 
to action. But it is up to Security Council members, on 
behalf  of  the  international  community,  to  act,  and  for 
all United Nations members to then support them. 

The events of the past week in Burma remind us 
of the irrepressible human impulse to seek democratic 
freedoms  and  human  rights.  The  United  Nations  and 
individual countries must let the courageous protestors 
in  Burma  know  that  their  message  is  understood  —  a 
message  on 
towards  genuine 
democratic  progress  and  national  reconciliation,  and 
away from military domination. 
the  need 
to  move 

Australia has joined the international community 
in  condemning  the  violent  suppression  of  peaceful 
demonstrations by monks and civilians. We call for the 
immediate release of those arrested for exercising their 
fundamental  human  rights  to  peaceful  protest  and  for 
humane  treatment  of  all  those  detained.  Australia  is 
also  introducing  targeted  financial  measures  against 
members  of  the  Burmese  regime  and  its  supporters  to 
increase  pressure  on  them  to  engage  in  genuine 
political reform and national reconciliation. 

Australia  supports  the  consistent  efforts  that  the 
United  Nations  has  made  to  monitor  and  improve  the 
situation in Burma. We welcomed the statement by the 
United  Nations  Security  Council  following  its  special 
consultations  on  26  September.  We  welcome  the 
current visit to Burma by the United Nations Secretary-
General’s Special Envoy, Mr. Ibrahim Gambari, and his 
access  to  Daw  Aung  San  Suu  Kyi.  We  urge  the 
Burmese  authorities 
to  work  constructively  and 
meaningfully  with  him  in  support  of  his  United 
Nations-mandated mission. Mr. Gambari is well placed 
to  assist  in  achieving  a  peaceful  resolution  to  the 
current crisis. 

The  responsibility  to  protect  means  that  we,  the 
international  community,  must  act  when  confronted 
with  the  most  serious  of  crimes.  But  we  also  have  to 
act  to  confront  a  range  of  global  challenges,  from 
terrorism  and  climate  change  to  poverty.  Terrorists 
stand  in  stark  contrast  to  those  of  us  who  seek  to 
protect the vulnerable. Their goals are global and their 
reach  transnational.  No  single  country  can  solve  the 
problem  alone.  There  have  been  some  successes  in 
combating  terrorist  networks,  but  we  need  to  develop 
even more effective strategies to disrupt and dismantle 
their networks. 
Australia  calls  on  Member  States  of  the  United 

Nations 
implement  fully  all  relevant  Security 
Council resolutions on freezing the assets of terrorists. 
Terrorist  organizations  must  be  starved  of  their  funds 
and  support. Australia  also  calls  on  Member  States  to 
conclude a comprehensive convention against terrorism 
as  soon  as  possible.  A  convention  would  provide  a 
solid  foundation  for 
to 
prevent, prosecute and punish terrorist acts. 

The  international  community  must  support  the 
efforts  of  States  that  fight  terrorism  —  in  particular, 
fledgling democratic States. We must help those States 
to  establish 
institutions  and

to  prevent  man-

portable  air-defence  systems  from  falling  into  the 
hands  of  terrorist  groups.  We  should  also  intensify 
work  on  the  Global  Initiative  to  Combat  Nuclear 
Terrorism.  Australia  urges  Member  States  to  join  the 
Initiative. 

We must also act to stop the spread of weapons of 
mass destruction. Australia welcomes the robust action 
taken  by  the  Security  Council  over  the  past  year  in 
imposing  sanctions  against  programmes  relating  to 
proliferation  in  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of 
Korea  and  also  in  Iran. The  Security  Council’s  action 
on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea nuclear 
issue  sent  a  strong  signal  to  that  country  that  the 
international community would not tolerate its nuclear 
programmes.  We  welcome  recent  progress  in  the  Six-
Party  Talks.  We  call  on  the  Democratic  People’s 
Republic  of  Korea  to  maintain  the  momentum  and 
implement fully its commitment to denuclearize. 

The Security  Council also  sent a strong  message 
to  Iran.  We  welcome  Iran’s  stated  intention  to  work 
with  the  International Atomic  Energy Agency  (IAEA) 
to 
the 
international  community,  including  Australia,  remains 
deeply concerned about Iran’s nuclear programme. Iran 
should suspend its uranium enrichment programme, as 
required  by  the  Security  Council,  and  cooperate  fully 
with the IAEA. 
Australia  also  hopes  that  the  United  Nations  can 

continue  its  work  in  protecting  populations  by  raising 
barriers  against 
in  conventional 
weapons. We support the development of an arms trade 
treaty. 

Climate  change  is  another  challenge  that  clearly 
requires our urgent attention. Climate change demands 
an effective and enduring global response. The United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is 
the  forum  to  forge  such  a  global  response.  On  9 
September,  the  leaders  of  the  21-member Asia-Pacific 
Economic  Cooperation  (APEC)  economies  issued  the 
historic  Sydney  Declaration  on  Climate  Change, 
Energy  Security  and  Clean  Development.  The  APEC

leaders,  whose

economies  should  contribute  to  meeting  shared  global 
goals.  They  also  agreed  that  our  responses  must  be 
equitable  and  environmentally  and  economically 
effective,  as  well  as  capable  of  including  diverse 
approaches. 

The High-Level Event on Climate Change, hosted 
by  the  Secretary-General  on  24  September,  and  the 
Major  Economies  Meeting  on  Energy,  Security  and 
Climate  Change,  hosted  by  United  States  Secretary 
Rice a few days later, highlighted these same goals and 
built  additional  international  momentum  for  a  post-
2012 agreement. Australia calls on parties to this year’s 
United Nations conference on climate change in Bali to 
agree  to  a  new  mandate  for  the  Convention  that  will 
move  beyond  Kyoto  and  forge  a  comprehensive  new 
agreement. 

The  international  community  must  also  address 
pressing health and human security issues, in particular 
the spread of HIV/AIDS. Failure to combat HIV/AIDS 
will  have  global  economic  and  social  consequences. 
Australia  takes  its  responsibility  to  act  seriously  and 
continues  to  support  its  near  neighbours  in  the  Asia 
Pacific region to address the challenge of HIV/AIDS.

alleviating  poverty.  At  the  United  Nations  Summit  in 
2005,  Australia  undertook  to  double  its  development 
assistance budget by the year 2010, and we are well on

I  have  outlined  today  serious  global  challenges 
facing  the  international  community  —  humanitarian 
and  political  crises,  including  in  Darfur  and  Burma, 
climate  change,  poverty,  weapons  of  mass  destruction 
and  terrorism.  The  Security  Council  has  drawn  upon 
the  responsibility  to  protect  principle,  endorsed  by 
leaders  at  the  2005  Summit.  It  is  clear  that  the

a 
responsibility  to  protect  those  facing  genocide,  war 
crimes and crimes against humanity. 

Our  task  is  to  respond  quickly  and  effectively. 
The  United  Nations  has  been  vested  with  great 
authority by its Members to effect real change. But that 
authority  will  mean  little  unless  we  turn  commitment 
into action. 
The  President:  Several  representatives  have 

asked to speak in exercise of the right of reply. May I 
remind  members  that,  in  accordance  with  General 
Assembly  decision  34/401,  statements  in  exercise  of 
the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first 
intervention  and  to  five  minutes  for  the  second 
intervention  and  should  be  made  by  delegations  from 
their seats. 
Mr. Shinyo (Japan): My delegation would like to 

exercise its right of reply in response to the statement 
made by the representative of the Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea this morning. The statement by the 
representative  of  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of 
Korea  concerning  Japan  is  entirely  groundless  and  we 
cannot  accept  it.  First,  the  claim  by  the  Democratic 
People’s  Republic  of  Korea  that  Japan  is  turning  its 
self-defence force into a regular army, with a mandate 
of pre-emptive strikes on other countries, by changing 
the peace constitution into a war constitution is totally 
false.  

In  accordance  with  its  constitution,  for  the  60 
years since the end of the Second World War Japan has 
adhered  consistently  and  exclusively  to  a  defensive 
security  policy  based  on  the  principle  that  it  should 
never become a military Power. Japan does not possess 
nuclear  weapons,  nor  does  it  export  weapons  of  any 
kind  and  it  has  been  actively  involved  in  the  field  of 
arms  control,  disarmament  and  non-proliferation.  I 
wish to draw the attention of all Member States to the 
fact  that  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea 
conducted  a  nuclear  test  on  9  October  2006. That  test 
was in addition to the ballistic missile launches by the 
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in July 2006. 

That act — which was a grave threat to the peace 
and security not only of Japan but also of East Asia and 
the international community — is totally unacceptable. 
We  also  have  to  recall  that  on  14  October  2006,  the 
Security Council adopted unanimously resolution 1718 
(2006)  sending  out  a  resolute  message  from  the 
international  community  condemning 
the  act  and 
indicating  measures  to  be  taken  by  the  Democratic 
People’s  Republic  of  Korea  and  the  other  Member 
States of the United Nations.   
With  regard  to  the  measures  against  the  General

mentioned  by  the  representative  of  the  Democratic 
People’s Republic of Korea this morning, the measures 
being  taken  by  the  Government  of  Japan  are  in 
accordance  with  its  national  laws  and  do  not  violate 
international  law  in  any  way.  The  allegation  of  the 
Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea  is  therefore 
totally groundless. 

Let  me  explain  in  detail.  On  25 April  2007,  the 
Japanese  police  conducted  a  search  on  a  subsidiary 
organization  of  the  General  Association  of  Korean 
Residents in Japan, located in the Korean Press Hall, in 
order  to  collect  evidence  related  to  the  suspected 
abduction  case.  Before  the  search  was  conducted,  the 
Japanese  police  obtained  a  search  warrant  from  the 
appropriate  court.  The  Japanese  police  searched  the 
building  legally  and  properly.  They  took  no  illegal 
action  of  any  kind  and  engaged  in  no  violence  or 
threats.  As  for  the  measures  with  respect  to  the 
headquarters  of  the  General  Association  of  Korean 
Residents in Japan and the land it occupies, they were 
necessary  in  order  to  collect  a  debt  that  the  General 
Association  owed.  They  were  taken  by  a  Japanese 
public  organization  called 
and 
Collection  Corporation  (RCC)  to  collect  a  debt  owed 
by  the  General  Association  of  Korean  Residents  in 
Japan.  The  RCC’s  collection  activities  with  regard  to 
the  non-performing  loans  of  the  bankrupt  Democratic 
People’s  Republic 
credit 
institutions, or credit unions, did not differ in any way 
from  measures  taken  with  respect  to  other  bankrupt 
financial  institutions  in  Japan.  The  measures  were 
taken purely for the purpose of collecting debt and not 
for any political or diplomatic purpose.

to  remain 
in  Japan  and 



The  Government  of  Japan  has  long  been  taking 
measures to ensure that Korean residents in Japan lead 
normal  lives,  including  granting  them  the  appropriate 
legal  status 
improving 
conditions that affect how they live. The constitution of 
Japan  guarantees  equality  before  the  law  without 
discrimination  of  any  kind.  On  the  basis  of  that 
principle,  Japan  has  striven  to  achieve  a  society  free 
from all forms of discrimination. 

Finally,  the  fundamental  policy  of  Japan  with 
regard to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is 
based  on  the  Pyongyang  Declaration  of  17  September 
2002  and  remains  unchanged.  Japan  will  continue  to 
make  every  effort  to  normalize  relations  through  the 
settlement  of  differences  relating  to  the  unfortunate 
past  and  the  comprehensive  resolution  of  outstanding 
problems  such  as  those  relating  to  nuclear  issues,  the 
abductions and missile issues.  

Japan would  like to  consult with the Democratic 
People’s  Republic  of  Korea  on  concrete  steps  that 
might be taken for normalization based on the outcome 
of  the  recent  meeting  of  the  working  group  on  the 
normalization  of  relations  between  Japan  and  the 
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. 
Mr.  Hill  (Australia):  I  am  exercising  a  right  of 

reply in relation to assertions by Mr. Oti, Minister for 
Foreign  Affairs  of 
in  his 
statement  to  the  General  Assembly  last  evening  (see 
A/62/PV.13), that the Australia-led Regional Assistance 
Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) has occupied 
Solomon Islands and is in contravention of the United 
Nations Charter.  

Those  assertions  are  completely  unfounded. 
RAMSI is a Pacific Islands Forum-endorsed mission. It 
was  deployed  at  the  request  of  the  Solomon  Islands 
Government  in  response  to  a  seriously  deteriorating 
law-and-order  situation 
Islands. 
RAMSI  was  also  supported  by  the  United  Nations 
Security  Council  and  the  Commonwealth.  RAMSI’s 
presence and  work in Solomon Islands is underpinned 
by  an  international  treaty  between  Solomon  Islands, 
Australia  and  all  the  other  members  of  the  Pacific 
Islands Forum which are active participants in RAMSI. 
Facilitating legislation was unanimously passed by the 
Solomon Islands Parliament. 

As the country entrusted under the RAMSI treaty 
with lead responsibility for RAMSI, Australia remains 
vigilant of the importance of respecting the sovereignty 
the  Solomon  Islands, 
the  Solomon 
in 
A/62/PV.15
for 
annual 
has  worked 
the  Solomon 
reporting  by  RAMSI  on 
of  Solomon  Islands.  RAMSI  clearly  does  not  seek  to 
substitute 
Islands  Government. 
Rather,  RAMSI  has  created  an  enabling  environment 
so  that  the  Solomon  Islands  Government  can  once 
again  deliver  essential  services  to  its  people.  All 
RAMSI  programmes  are  agreed  with  the  Solomon 
Islands  Government.  RAMSI 
in 
partnership  with  the  Solomon  Islands  Government  to 
rebuild  the  institutions  of  State  to  enable  them  to 
enforce  the  country’s  own  laws  and  regulations.  In 
doing  so,  RAMSI  has  assisted  Solomon  Islands  to 
reassert its sovereignty. 

There  are  a  variety  of  mechanisms  in  place  that 
ensure RAMSI’s accountability to the Solomon Islands 
Government  and  contributing  countries,  including  a 
treaty  obligation  for  the  Australian  and  Solomon 
Islands  Prime  Ministers  to  jointly  report  to  Pacific 
Island  Forum  leaders  meetings  on  RAMSI  each  year, 
monthly  reports  to  the  members  of  the  Pacific  Island 
Forum, 
its 
performance, a medium-term strategy that maps out an 
agreed  path  by  the  Solomon  Islands  Government  and 
RAMSI  towards  the  completion  of  RAMSI’s  mandate 
and  a  wide-ranging  review  of  RAMSI  by  the  Pacific 
Island  Forum  at  the  specific  request  of  the  Solomon 
Islands Government. 

RAMSI has now been in the Solomon Islands for 
four years and in that short time has made remarkable 
progress  that  has  seen  fundamental  improvements  to 
people’s  daily  lives.  Law  and  order  was  quickly 
restored,  enabling  people  to  lead  normal  lives,  free  of 
fear and intimidation. Revenue has grown in the order 
of  over  500  per  cent.  Foreign  investors  are  returning. 
The  Solomon 
is  producing 
balanced  budgets,  and  government  services,  such  as 
schools and health clinics, have been restored. 

Given  these  significant  achievements,  it  is  not 
surprising  that  RAMSI  continues  to  enjoy  widespread 
community  support  in  the  Solomon  Islands.  A  recent 
survey demonstrated that over 90 per cent of Solomon 
Islanders  continue  to  support  the  presence  of  RAMSI 
in their country. 
Mr. Bhattarai (Nepal): My delegation would like 

to exercise the right of reply in response to the remarks 
made  by  the  leader  of  the  Bhutanese  delegation  this 
afternoon on the issue of Bhutanese refugees sheltered 
in  Nepal  on  humanitarian  grounds  for  the  past  16 
years.

Mr.  Pak  Tok  Hun
To conclude, I would like to reiterate the position 
A/62/PV.15 


The  presence  of  Bhutanese  refugees  in  camps  in 
Nepal  and  their  plight  has  roots  in  the  discriminatory 
policy  of  that  Government  towards  its  citizens.  His 
remarks are misplaced and, therefore, unfounded. They 
ignore the suffering of the refugees in camps. 

Nepal considers this problem as one between the 
refugees  and  the  Government  of  Bhutan.  Our  position 
is that these refugees must be allowed to return to their 
homeland  in  full  dignity  and  honour,  without  any 
conditions,  and  they  must  be  allowed  to  be  a  part  of 
their national life. 

that the leader of my delegation took yesterday. 
(Democratic  People’s 

Republic  of  Korea):  I  would  like  to  exercise  the  right 
of reply to the statement or comment by the delegation 
of Japan. 

The  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea 
cannot  remain  unconcerned  at  the  recent  moves  by 
Japan  to  militarize  by  turning  various  forces  into  a 
regular  army.  We  are  concerned  about  these  Japanese 
moves,  particularly  because  Japan  is  close  to  our 
country  and 
the  Asian  countries  and 
committed the massacre of millions of innocent people. 
Japan  has  furthermore  been  distorting  its  aggressive 
history instead of repudiating it. 

Japan’s  non-admission  of 
its  crimes  against 
humanity  is  little  short  of  an  open  declaration  that  it 
would again launch military aggression overseas. 
It is against this background that the Democratic 

People’s  Republic  of  Korea  built  a  strong  defensive 
deterrent in order to ensure that Japan  would not dare 
to  launch  aggression  against  the  Democratic  People’s 
Republic of Korea anymore. My delegation would like 
to  remind  the  Japanese  delegate  that  renouncing  its 
militaristic  past  is  best  for  Japan  itself  and  that  the 
international community will not allow Japan to play a 
political  and  military  role  equivalent  to  its  economic 
power. 

As for the second issue that the delegate of Japan 
mentioned,  we  are  very  much  concerned  about  the 
suppression  of  Koreans  and  their  organizations  in 
Japan  by  Japanese  authorities.  This  has  become  an 
intolerable  situation.  From  the  outset  of  this  year, 
Japanese  authorities  set  in  motion  vicious  media 
attacks  with  various  kinds  of  false  reports  aimed  at 
tarnishing the image of Korean organizations in Japan 
it 
invaded 

in a frantic bid to incite bitterness towards my country, 
the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea,  and 
Korean organizations in Japan. 

At  the  same  time,  the  director  of  the  Japanese 
National  Police  Agency  has  organized  a  wholesale 
repressive campaign by his policemen to prosecute and 
arrest  officials  of  Chongryon,  Korean  organizations 
and  Koreans  in  Japan,  and  to  carry  out  other  actions, 
although  the  police  have  an  obligation  to  protect  the 
rights and activities of all citizens. They claim that it is 
the  task  of  the  police  to  put  pressure  on  North  Korea 
and  to  force  North  Korea  to  enter  into  negotiations 
with Japan. 

The Japanese police authorities have conducted a 
forced  search  of  numerous  Korean  organizations  and 
related  facilities,  including  the  headquarters  of  the 
Chongryon  and  Korean  schools,  blundering  and 
arresting  Koreans  with  the  support  of  heavily  armed 
police units and armed vehicles. 

The  Japanese  authorities  went  even  further  to 
force  Chongryon  to  sell  land  and  buildings  and  its 
entire headquarters in a vicious attempt to exterminate 
that Korean organization at any cost. 

This  move  seeks  to  physically  annihilate  the 
centre  of  the  activities  of  Korean  organizations  that 
defends  the  democratic  national  rights  of  Koreans  in 
Japan  and  to  stamp  out  the  activities  of  the  Korean 
organizations  and  the  Koreans  in  Japan.  That  Korean 
organization,  called  Chongryon,  is  alleged  to  be  an 
overseas  compatriots  organization  of  the  Democratic 
People’s  Republic  of  Korea.  Its  mission  is  to  protect 
the  democratic  national  rights  of  the  direct  victims  of 
the  drafting  of  Koreans  by  Japan  in  the  past  and  the 
Koreans in Japan and their descendants. 

The  Japanese  authorities  describe  their  criminal 
action taken against Koreans and their organizations as 
carrying out the law or simply a financial issue relating 
to the collection of bonds. However, this is a political 
plot  and 
to  deprive 
Chongryon,  the  Korean  organization,  of  the  centre  of 
its  activities  and  destroy  it  at  any  cost.  But they deny 
this clear fact. 

I  would  also  like  to  reply  to  the  statement  made 
by  the  representative  of Australia  a  few  minutes  ago. 
The  nuclear  issue  on  the  Korean  peninsula,  as  made 
clear time and again, including from this very podium, 
is  no  more  than  a  product  of  deep-rooted,  hostile 
represents  criminal  moves

policies  towards  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of 
Korea.  No  issue  will  be  solved  by  resorting  to 
sanctions  and  pressure  and  hostile  policies,  as  proven 
by history. 

Our  national  military  power  is  defensive  and  its 
nature  rests  solely  on  the  need  to  safeguard  our 
sovereignty. It also serves the interests of the countries 
in the region to promote peace, security and stability. 

We  urge Australia  to  look  squarely  at  the  nature 
and origin of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula 
and to act in a way that is conducive to the solution of 
this issue. 
Mr.  Shinyo  (Japan):  It  was  not  our  intention  to 

take the floor again, but we feel that we are obliged to 
reply  to  the  statement  that  was  just  made  by  the 
delegate  of  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic  of 
Korea. 

Japan has been facing up to its past with sincerity 
and  consistency.  We  feel  remorse  and  have  offered 
apologies  so  many  times  since  the  end  of  the  Second 
World War. With that in mind, since that time Japan has 
been  consistently  dedicating 
to  promoting 
international  peace  and  prosperity  as  well  as 
demonstrating  its  respect  for  democracy  and  human 
rights.  That  is  a  very  well-known  fact  to  all  the 
Members of the United Nations.  
So  what  was  said  by  the  representative  of  the 

Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea 
is  not 
acceptable.  As  I  have  already  stated  in  my  previous 
statement,  the  Japanese  policy  towards  defence  and 
towards security in our region is solely of a defensive 
nature.  We  have  already  clearly  stated  that  Japan’s 
policy  is  confined  only  to  defending  my  country  and 
that we have no policy whatsoever of exporting arms to 
foreign  countries.  We  do  not  possess  any  nuclear 
weapons  —  which  is  different  from  some  of  the 
neighbouring countries — and we have no policies that 
pose  a  threat  to  foreign  countries.  None  of  that  is  the 
case.  

Regarding  the  allegation  that  has  been  made  by 
the representative of the Democratic People’s Republic 
of  Korea  with  regard  to  the  General  Association  of 
Korean  Residents  in  Japan,  I  stated  in  my  previous 
statement  that  nothing  here  could  be  regarded  as  a 
violation  of  international  law,  and  nothing  should  be 
regarded as imposing measures hindering the residency 
itself 
A/62/PV.15
Mr.  Pak  Tok  Hun
of Koreans living in Japan. We are totally against that 
kind of thing. 

I  do  not  have  to  repeat  once  again  because  we 
have  already  described  the  police  action  taken  by  the 
Japanese  police  authorities  vis-à-vis 
the  General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan and also the 
measures  taken  by  the  Resolution  and  Collection 
Corporation  (RCC),  which  is  a  public  organization, 
against  the  General  Association  of  Korean  Residents. 
This  was  an  issue  of  debt  on  the  part  of  that 
organization. And  the  first  one  was  closely  related  to 
the abduction case — and that is very serious. That is a 
serious crime in Japan. 
Thus,  the  allegation  that  has  been  made  by  the 

Democratic  People’s  Republic  of  Korea 
is  quite 
unacceptable.  We  would  like  to  repeat  that  the  policy 
that has been applied and other facts clearly show that 
there is no weight to this allegation. 
(Democratic  People’s 

Republic  of  Korea):  I  am  very  sorry  to  take  the  floor 
again. I will be very brief concerning the remarks made 
by the Japanese representative. Japan always says that 
it  apologizes  for  the  crimes  committed  in  the  past,  in 
particular against Koreans. But this is only lip-service. 
We  very  often  see  that  they  revoke  their  apologies. 
Their apologies should be followed by action. 
For example, numerous high-level officials of the 

Japanese  Government  and  of  the  parliament,  even  say 
that  there  were  no  comfort  women  for  the  Japanese 
army. They distort the facts. They even humiliate those 
comfort  women  as  prostitutes.  They  call  it  the  “war 
against Asian  countries”,  “the  war  for  liberation”.  We 
do not see any sincere apology on the part of Japan.  

On  the  second  issue,  that  of  the  Association  of 
Korean  Residents  in  Japan,  he  said  there  was  no 
violation. He said that this was an issue of debt. If this 
issue is an issue of debt, as the Japanese representative 
said,  then  why  did  Japan  mobilize  a  huge  force  of 
armed  forces  —  hundreds  of  policemen,  and  police 
forces  with  armed  vehicles  —  to  suppress  those  who 
opposed the search by Japanese policemen?  

And  as  for  the  abduction  issue,  I  have  already 
made our position clear on 28 September, in my reply 
to  Japan  (see A/62/PV.11).  In  a  nutshell,  we  officially 
regret that the 13 Japanese were abducted, and we sent 
all  those  who  remained  alive  to  Japan,  together  with 
their  children.  I  wonder  if  the  Japanese  representative 
07-52434

A/62/PV.15 

has  ever  thought  about  the  crimes  Japan  committed 
against Koreans: 8.4 million were forcibly drafted and 
abducted.  But  they  have  never,  in  this  international 
forum, apologized for — or admitted — that. 


We  urge  Japan  to  undertake  a  policy  of  closer 
cooperation,  clearly  look  at  the  situation  now  and  act 
with prudence. 
The meeting rose at 8 p.m.
