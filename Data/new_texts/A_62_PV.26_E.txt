from  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean.  The  ballot 
papers reflect that pattern. 

In  accordance  with  established  practice,  there  is 
an  understanding  to  the  effect  that,  of  the  three  States 
to be elected from Africa and Asia, two should be from 
Africa and one from Asia. 

I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  those 
candidates,  their  number  not  exceeding  the  number  of 
seats  to  be  filled,  receiving  the  greatest  number  of 
votes  and  a  two-thirds  majority  of  those  present  and 
voting,  will  be  declared  elected.  In  the  case  of  a  tie 
vote  for  a  remaining  seat,  there  will  be  a  restricted 
ballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an 
equal number of votes. 

that procedure? 
  It was so decided. 

The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the 

rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret 
ballot and there shall be no nominations. 
Regarding candidatures, I have been informed by 

the  Chairpersons  of  the  respective  regional  groups  of 
the  following.  For  the  three  vacant  seats  from  among 
the African  and Asian States,  there  are  three  endorsed 
candidates,  namely,  Burkina  Faso,  the  Libyan  Arab 
Jamahiriya and Viet Nam. For the one vacant seat from 
among  the  Eastern  European  States,  there  are  two 
candidates,  namely,  Croatia  and  the  Czech  Republic. 
For the one vacant seat from among the Latin America

Agenda item 112 
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs 
(a)    Election of five non-permanent members of the 
Security Council 

The  President: The  General Assembly  will  now 
proceed to the election of five non-permanent members 
of  the  Security  Council  to  replace  those  members 
whose term of office expires on 31 December 2007. 

The  five  outgoing  non-permanent  members  are 
the  following:  the  Congo,  Ghana,  Peru,  Qatar  and 
Slovakia. Those five States cannot be re-elected. Their 
names,  therefore,  should  not  appear  on  the  ballot 
papers. 

Apart  from  the  five  permanent  members,  the 
Security  Council  will  include  in  the  year  2008  the 
following  States:  Belgium,  Indonesia,  Italy,  Panama 
and South Africa. The names of those States, therefore, 
should also not appear on the ballot papers. 
Of  the  five  non-permanent  members  that  will 

remain in office in the year 2008, two are from Africa 
and Asia, one is from Latin America and the Caribbean 
and two are from Western Europe and other States. 

Consequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General 
Assembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII), of 17 December 
1963,  the  five  non-permanent  members  should  be 
elected  according  to  the  following  pattern:  three  from 
Africa  and  Asia,  one  from  Eastern  Europe  and  one

and Caribbean States, there are two candidates, namely, 
Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic. 

In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of 
procedure,  we  shall  now  proceed  to  the  election  by 
secret ballot. 

Before we begin the voting process, I should like 
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the 
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no 
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a 
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting. 

I would also like to seek the usual cooperation of 
representatives  during  the  time  of  the  conduct  of  the 
election.  Please  be  reminded  that  during  the  voting 
process,  all  campaigning  should  cease  in  the  General 
Assembly Hall. That means in particular that once the 
meeting has begun, no more campaign material can be 
distributed  inside  the  Hall.  All  delegates  are  also 
requested  to  remain  at  their  seats  so  that  the  voting 
process  can  proceed  in  an  orderly  manner.  I  thank 
members for their cooperation. 

We shall now begin the voting process. Members 
are  requested  to  remain  seated  until  all  ballots  have 
been collected. 

Ballot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” will now 
be  distributed.  I  request  representatives  to  use  only 
those ballot papers that have been distributed. 

May  I  ask  representatives  to  write  on  the  ballot 
papers  marked  “A”,  for  the African  and Asian  States, 
the  names  of  the  three  States  for  which  they  wish  to 
vote; on the ballot papers marked “B”, for the Eastern 
European  States,  the  name  of  the  one  State  for  which 
they wish to vote; and on the ballot papers marked “C”, 
for the Latin American and Caribbean States, the name 
of the one State for which they wish to vote. 

A  ballot  will  be  declared  invalid  if  it  contains 
more names of Member States from the relevant region 
than  the  number  of  seats  assigned  to  it. A  ballot  will 
also be declared invalid if all the names of the Member 
States  on  that  ballot  do  not  belong  to  the  relevant 
region.  If  a  ballot  paper  contains  names  of  Member 
States  that  do  not  belong  to  that  region,  the  ballot 
remains  valid,  but  only  the  names  of  the  Member 
States  that  belong  to  the  relevant  region  will  be 
counted.  The  names  of  Member  States  that  do  not 
belong to that region will not be counted at all.

Latin American and global unity. Now, more than ever 
before,  in  the  world  in  which  we  live,  which  is

Before  adjourning  this  meeting,  I  would  like  to

consider the question of the inclusion and allocation of 
the  item  entitled  “Question  of  the  Comorian  island  of

As  members  are  aware,  the  High-level  Dialogue

in  regional  geographical  distribution  and 
balance 
balanced 
representation  of  all  stakeholders.  The 
co-chairs will be selected from among the highest level 
of  those  participating  in  the  meeting.  I  trust  that  all 
regional  groups  will  strive  to  present  their  candidates 
before  that  time  to  allow  us  to  take  them  into 
consideration  in  the  organization  of  this  high-level 
event. 

Before  adjourning  this  meeting,  I  would  like  to
