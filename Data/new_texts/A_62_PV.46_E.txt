The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. 

Agenda item 12 (continued) 
Support by the United Nations system of the efforts 
of Governments to promote and consolidate new or 
restored democracies  
  Draft resolution (A/62/L.9) 


The  President:  Members  will  recall  that  the 
General Assembly held the debate on this Agenda item 
at its 44th plenary meeting, on 5 November 2007. 

We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution 
A/62/L.9.  Before  giving  the  floor  to  the  speaker  in 
explanation  of  vote  before  the  vote,  may  I  remind  the 
delegates  that  explanations  of  vote  are  limited  to  ten 
minutes  and  should  be  made  by  delegates  from  their 
seats. 
Mr. Chernenko (The Russian Federation) (spoke 

in  Russian):  The  Russian  Federation  supports  Qatar’s 
draft  resolution  entitled  “Support  by 
the  United 
Nations  system  of  the  efforts  of  Governments  to 
promote and consolidate new or restored democracies.” 
We 
the 
intergovernmental  process  under  United  Nations 
auspices,  characterized  by  its  openness  and  based  on 
the principle of constructive engagement.  

In  our  opinion,  the  process  of  new  or  restored 
democracies  seeks  to  resolve  two  interrelated  tasks. 
First  of  all,  it  performs  an  important  function  in 
providing a forum to exchange positive experiences in 
democratic 
the 

actively  participate 
strengthening 
construction 
support 
and 
and 
in 
to 
foundation and principles of democracy. Secondly, and 
no  less  important,  is  its  provision  of  support  to  States 
as  they  request  it.  We  are  convinced  that  this  type  of 
exchange  of  experience  and  constructive  involvement 
will allow us to enrich the very concept of democracy 
and give new substance to its principles.  

As  was  correctly  noted  in  this  draft  resolution, 
there  is  not  a  single  model  or  single  recipe  for 
democracy  in  our  world.  All  attempts  to  impose 
unilateral  approaches,  any  attempts 
forcibly 
inculcate  or  implant,  in  different  parts  of  the  world, 
one’s  own  approaches  to  democracy  are  fraught  with 
the  most  negative  consequences  on  the  stability  of 
different countries and regions. 
The  President:  We  have  heard  the  only  speaker 

in  explanation  of  vote  before  the  vote.  The  General 
Assembly will now take a decision on draft resolution 
A/62/L.9.  I  should  like  to  announce  that  since  the 
introduction  of  the  draft  resolution,  the  following 
countries  have  become 
the 
Bahamas,  Bulgaria,  Cape  Verde,  the  Comoros,  the 
Czech  Republic,  Germany,  Japan,  Kuwait,  the  Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya,  Madagascar,  Maldives,  Mali, 
Monaco,  Montenegro,  Philippines,  Poland,  Saudi 
Arabia,  Sweden,  Thailand,  Ukraine  and  the  United 
Arab Emirates. 

draft resolution A/62/L.9? 

May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt 
  Draft resolution A/62/L.9 was adopted (resolution 
62/7).

The  President:  Before  giving  the  floor  to  the 

speaker 
remind 
delegations that explanation of votes are limited to ten 
minutes and should be made by delegations from their 
seats. 
Mr.  Ehouzou  (Benin)  (spoke  in  French):  The 

delegation  of  Benin  welcomes  the  adoption  of  draft 
resolution  A/62/L.9,  entitled  “Support  by  the  United 
Nations  system  of  the  efforts  of  Governments  to 
promote and consolidate new or restored democracies” 
for  several  reasons. As  the  host  country  of  the  Fourth 
International  Conference  of  New  or  Restored 
Democracies,  held  in  Cotonou  from  4  to  6  December 
2000,  Benin 
to 
strengthening  democracy  in Africa  and  to  the  process 
of  the  International  Conference  of  New  or  Restored 
Democracies. 

to 
exchange  experiences,  which  makes  it  possible  to 
weave  a  dense  network  of  international  cooperation 
and  consultation  with  democratic  national  institutions, 
Benin was one of the main forces  at the African level 
in  the  drafting  of  the  African  Charter  on  Democracy, 
Elections  and  Governance,  which  was  adopted  by  the 
African  Union  in  January  2007,  at Addis Ababa. This 
text is a priceless victory for the peoples of the African 
continent. 

Benin is closely following the development of the 
New or Restored Democracies Movement. We express 
our great appreciation to Qatar for its initiatives within 
the framework of the follow-up to the implementation 
of  the  final  declaration  of  the  Sixth  International 
Conference  of  New  or  Restored  Democracies,  held  in 
Doha  in  November  2006.  We  must  also  welcome  the 
activities of the Advisory Board that was established to 
assist  the  Chairman  in  Office  of  the  Movement  in  his 
efforts  to  ensure  a  systematic  implementation  of  the 
recommendations contained in the Doha declaration.  

It is also fortunate that within this framework the 
Advisory Board was able to adopt its plan of action for 
the  2007-2009  period.  It  is  important  that  member 
States  be 
its 
implementation  through  practical  actions  having  an 
impact on the ability of democratic institutions to play 
their role in the operation of democratic systems put in 
place.

in 


Benin  thanks  all  the  countries  that  have  taken 
different  initiatives  to  support  the  efforts  of  new  or 
restored democracies in their efforts to strengthen their 
national  institutions  and  to  promote  good  governance 
so that democracy can go hand in hand with economic 
growth and sustainable development.  

The  Secretary-General  has  presented  a  very 
informative  report  on  Government 
initiatives  and 
makes  it  possible  to  assess  the  dynamic  of  solidarity 
showed  by  the  international  community  for  new  or 
restored  democracies,  but  also  the  bold  actions  that 
those  democracies  have  been  carrying  out  in  order  to 
strengthen their democratic achievements. We must be 
grateful for these developments.  It would be  desirable 
for the next report to deal with the efforts of the United 
Nations system.  

My  delegation  reiterates  its  steadfast  support  for 
the process of the International Conference of New or 
Restored  Democracies  as  a  framework  for  discussion 
and action in order to strengthen the advances made by 
new  or  restored  democracies.  That  is  why  we  fully 
support  the  resolution  that  has  just  been  adopted  on 
support for new or restored democracies. 
The President: We have heard all the speakers in 

explanation of vote. May I take it that it is the wish of 
the General Assembly to conclude its consideration of 
agenda item 12?

  Letter from Germany (A/62/159) 

The  President:  The Assembly  will  first  proceed 

to a by-election to elect a member of the Economic and 
Social Council in accordance with rule 140 of the rules 
of procedure.  
In this connection, I would first like to draw the 

attention  of  members 
to  document  A/62/159, 
containing a letter dated 23 July 2007 from the Chargé 
d’affaires  ad  interim  of  the  Permanent  Mission  of 
Germany  to  the  United  Nations.  In  his  letter,  the 
Chargé  d’affaires  announces  that  Germany  would  like 
to  relinquish  its  seat  on  the  Economic  and  Social 
Council at the end of the  year 2007 for the remaining

May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to 


term in favour of Liechtenstein. As a result, a vacancy 
will  occur  and  the  new  member  must  therefore  be 
elected  to  fill  Germany’s  unexpired  term  of  office, 
commencing  1  January  2008  and  expiring  on  31 
December 2008.  

In  accordance  with  paragraph  4  of  General 
Assembly  resolution  2847  (XXVI)  of  20  December 
1971  and  taking  into  account  that  the  vacancy  will 
occur  from  among  the  Western  European  and  other 
States,  the  new  member  should  therefore  be  elected 
from that region.  

I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  the 
candidate  who  receives  a  two-thirds  majority  and  the 
greatest  number  of  votes  by  Members  present  and 
voting  will  be  declared  elected.  In  the  case  of  a  tie 
vote, there will be a special restricted ballot limited to 
those  candidates  who  have  obtained  an  equal  number 
of votes.  

that procedure? 
It was so decided. 

The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the 

rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  the 
election shall be held by secret ballot and there shall be 
no  nominations.  Also  in  accordance  with  rule  92,  we 
shall proceed to the election by secret ballot.  

I  should  like  to  inform  members  that,  as  of  1 
January  2008,  the  following  States  from  the  Group  of 
Western European and other States will be represented 
on the Economic and Social Council: Austria, Canada, 
France,  Greece,  Luxembourg, 
the  Netherlands, 
Portugal and the United States of America. The names 
of these eight States should therefore not appear on the 
ballot.  

Before we begin the voting process, I should like 
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the 
rules of procedure, no representative shall interrupt the 
voting except on a point of order on the actual conduct 
of the voting. 

We shall now begin the voting process. Members 
are  requested  to  remain  seated  until  all  ballots  have 
been collected.  

Ballot  papers  will  now  be  distributed.  I  request 
representatives  to  use  only  those  ballot  papers  and  to 
write  on  them  the  name  of  the  State  for  which  they 
wish  to  vote.  A  ballot  will  be  declared  invalid  if  it 
A/62/PV.46
contains  the  name  of  more  than  one  Member  State 
from  the  relevant  region  for  the  one  vacant  seat 
assigned to it. A ballot will also be declared invalid if 
the  name  of  the  Member  State  on  that  ballot  does  not 
belong to the relevant region. 

At  the  invitation  of  the  President,  Mr.  Ehrmann 
(Austria),  Ms.  Molemele 
(Botswana),  Ms. 
Beshimova (Kyrgyzstan), Mrs. Zanelli (Peru) and 
Mr. Mićić (Serbia) acted as tellers. 
A vote was taken by secret ballot. 
  The  meeting  was  suspended  at  10.40  a.m.  and 
resumed at 11 a.m.

therefore not appear on the ballots.

Assembly  resolution  2847  (XXVI)  of  20  December 
1971, and taking into account the number of States that

four from African States, four from Asian States, three 
from  Eastern  European  States, 
three  from  Latin 
American and Caribbean States and four from Western 
European  and  other  States.  The  ballot  papers  reflect 
this pattern. 

I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  those 
candidates,  their  number  not  exceeding  the  number  of 
seats to be filled, who receive a two-thirds majority of 
votes  and  the  greatest  number  of  votes  and  by 
Members present and voting, will be declared elected.

The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the 

rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  the 
election shall be held by secret ballot and there shall be 
no nominations. 

Regarding candidatures of the respective regional

from  among  the  Eastern  European  States,  the  Group 
has  endorsed  three  candidates:  Moldova,  Poland  and

among  the  Latin  American  and  Caribbean  States,  the 
Group  has  endorsed  three  candidates:  Brazil,  Saint

of the voting. 

I  should  like  to  seek  the  usual  cooperation  of 
representatives  during  the  time  of  the  conduct  of  the 
election.  Please  be  reminded  that  during  the  voting 
process,  all  campaigning  should  cease  in  the  General 
Assembly Hall. This means in particular that once the 
meeting has begun, no more campaign material can be 
distributed  inside  the  Hall.  All  delegates  are  also 
requested  to  remain  at  their  seats  so  that  the  voting 
process  can  proceed  in  an  orderly  manner.  I  thank 
members for their cooperation.

Ballot papers marked A, B, C, D and E will now 
be  distributed.  I  request  representatives  to  use  only 
those ballot papers and to write on them the names of 
the States for which they wish to vote. 

A  ballot  will  be  declared  invalid  if  it  contains 
more names of Member States from the relevant region 
than  the  number  of  seats  assigned  to  it. A  ballot  will 
also be declared invalid if all the names of the Member 
States  on  the  ballot  do  not  belong  to  the  relevant 
region. If a ballot paper for a region contains some of 
the names of the Member States that do not belong to 
the region, the ballot remains valid but only the names
