(The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) 
Republic of Venezuela and Zimbabwe. Therefore, those 
25 States are not eligible in this election. 

I  should  now  like  to  inform  members  that  the 
following States have been nominated by the Economic 
and  Social  Council:  the  three African  States  for  three 
vacancies  are  Kenya,  the  Libyan Arab  Jamahiriya  and 
Niger;  the  three  Asian  States  for  three  vacancies  are 
Bangladesh, China and the Republic of Korea; and the 
one  Latin  American  and  Caribbean  State  for  one 
vacancy is Jamaica. 

In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of 
procedure, all elections should be held by secret ballot 
and  there  shall  be  no  nominations.  However,  I  should 
like  to  recall  paragraph  16  of  General  Assembly 
decision  34/401,  whereby  the  practice  of  dispensing 
with the secret ballot for elections to subsidiary organs 
when  the  number  of  candidates  corresponds  to  the 
number  of  seats  to  be  filled  should  become  standard, 
unless  a  delegation  specifically  requests  a  vote  on  a 
given election. 

In the absence of such a request, may I take it that 
the Assembly decides to proceed to the election on the 
basis of dispensing with the secret ballot? 
It was so decided. 

The President: The number of States nominated 

from  among  the  African  States,  the  Asian  States  and 
the Latin American and Caribbean States is equal to the 
number of seats to be filled in each of those groups. 

May I therefore take it that the Assembly wishes 
to declare those States nominated by the Economic and

I  should  like  to  remind  members  that,  after 
1 January  2008  the  following  States  will  still  be 
members  of  the  Governing  Council:  Algeria,  Angola, 
Antigua  and  Barbuda,  Argentina,  Australia,  Austria,

Congo,  France,  Germany,  Haiti,  Indonesia,  Japan, 
Kenya, Pakistan, the Republic of Korea, Romania, the 
Russian  Federation,  South  Africa,  Thailand,  Uganda, 
the United States of America  and Uruguay. Therefore, 
those 29 States are not eligible in this election. 

As members know, in accordance with rule 92 of 
the  rules  of  procedure,  all  elections  shall  be  held  by 
secret  ballot  and  there  shall  be  no  nominations. 
However,  I  should  like  to  recall  paragraph  16  of 
General  Assembly  decision  34/401,  whereby 
the 
practice  of  dispensing  with  the  secret  ballot  for 
elections  to  subsidiary  organs  when  the  number  of 
candidates  corresponds  to  the  number  of  seats  to  be 
filled  should  become  standard,  unless  a  delegation 
specifically requests a vote on a given election. 

In the absence of such a request, may I take it that 
the Assembly decides to proceed to the election on that 
basis? 
It was so decided. 

The Acting President: Regarding candidatures, I 

have  been  informed  by  the  Chairmen  of  the  regional 
groups that for the eight seats from the African States, 
the  eight  endorsed  candidates  are  Benin,  the  Congo, 
Guinea,  Mali,  Mauritius,  the  Niger,  Somalia  and 
Tunisia. 

For  the  seven  seats  from  the  Asian  States,  the 
seven endorsed candidates are Bangladesh, Fiji, India, 
the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia 
and Tuvalu. 

For  the  three  seats  from  the  Eastern  European 
States,  the  three  endorsed  candidates  are  Belarus, 
Croatia and Hungary. 

For  the  five  seats  from  the  Latin  American  and 
Caribbean  States,  the  five  endorsed  candidates  are  the 
Bahamas, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba and Mexico. 

For the six seats from the Western European and 
other  States,  the  six  endorsed  candidates  are  Finland, 
Israel, Italy, Monaco, the Netherlands and Spain. 
Since  the  number  of  candidates  endorsed  by  the 

African States, the Asian States, the Eastern European

of 


States,  the  Latin  American  and  Caribbean  States  and 
the Western  European  and  other  States  corresponds  to 
the  number  of  seats  to  be  filled  in  each  region,  may  I 
take it that the General Assembly decides to elect those 
candidates as members of the Governing Council of the 
United  Nations  Environment  Programme  for  a  four-
year term of office beginning on 1 January 2008? 
It was so decided. 

The  Acting  President:  The  following  29  States 

have  thus  been  elected  members  of  the  Governing 
Council 
the  United  Nations  Environment 
Programme for a four-year term of office beginning on

Niger,  Saudi  Arabia,  Somalia,  Spain,  Tunisia  and 
Tuvalu. 

I  congratulate  the  States  that  have  been  elected 
members  of  the  Governing  Council  of  the  United 
Nations Environment Programme. 

May  I  take  it  that  it  is  the  wish  if  the  General 
Assembly to conclude its consideration of sub-item (b) 
of agenda item 113?  

It was so decided.

members  that,  in  order  to  allow  time  for  further 
consultations  on  draft 
the 
resolution  A/62/L.11, 
A/62/PV.52
consideration  of  agenda  item  48,  âIntegrated  and

The  Acting  President:  I  would  now  like  to 

consult  members  regarding  an  extension  for  the  work 
of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee 
(Fourth Committee). Members will recall that at its 2nd 
plenary  meeting,  on  21  September  2007,  the  General 
Assembly  approved 
the 
General  Committee  that  the  Special  Political  and 
Decolonization  Committee  (Fourth  Committee)  would 
complete its work by Thursday, 15 November 2007. 
However, the President has been informed by the 

Chairman  of  the  Special  Political  and  Decolonization 
Committee  that  the  Committee  will  not  be  able  to 
complete  its  work  by  today,  Thursday,  15  November 
and would need an additional meeting on 20 November 
2007,  depending  on  the  availability  of  conference 
services. 

May I therefore take it that the General Assembly 
agrees  to  extend  the  work  of  the  Special  Political  and 
Decolonization Committee for one additional meeting?
