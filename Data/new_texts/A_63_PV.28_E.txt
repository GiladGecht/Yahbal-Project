In  accordance  with  established  practice,  there  is 
an understanding to the effect that, of the two States to

seats  to  be  filled,  receiving  the  greatest  number  of 
votes  and  a  two-thirds  majority  of  those  present  and 
voting,  will  be  declared  elected.  In  the  case  of  a  tie 
vote  for  a  remaining  seat,  there  will  be  a  restricted 
ballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an 
equal number of votes.

Agenda item 103 
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs 
  (a)  Election of five non-permanent members of the 
Security Council 
The  President: The  General Assembly  will  now 

proceed to the election of five non-permanent members 
of  the  Security  Council  to  replace  those  members 
whose term of office expires on 31 December 2008. 

The  five  outgoing  non-permanent  members  are 
the  following:  Belgium,  Indonesia,  Italy,  Panama  and 
South  Africa.  Those  five  States  cannot  be  re-elected. 
Their names, therefore, should not appear on the ballot 
papers. 

Apart  from  the  five  permanent  members,  the 
Security  Council  will  include  in  the  year  2009  the 
following  States:  Burkina  Faso,  Costa  Rica,  Croatia, 
the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Viet Nam. The names 
of those States, therefore, should also not appear on the 
ballot papers. 

Of  the  five  non-permanent  members  that  will 
remain in office in the year 2009, three are from Africa 
and Asia, one is from Eastern Europe and one is from 
Latin  America  and 
the  Caribbean.  Consequently, 
pursuant 
to  paragraph  3  of  General  Assembly 
resolution  1991 A  (XVIII),  of  17  December  1963,  the 
five  non-permanent  members  should  be  elected 
according  to  the  following  pattern:  two  from  Africa 
and Asia,  one  from  Latin America  and  the  Caribbean

A/63/PV.28 

from Africa  and Asia,  one  should  be  from Africa  and 
one from Asia. 

For  the  one  vacant  seat  from  among  the  Latin 
American  and Caribbean  States, there is one endorsed 
candidate,  namely,  Mexico.  For  the  two  vacant  seats 
from  among  the  Western  European  and  other  States, 
there are three candidates, namely, Austria, Iceland and 
Turkey.  

In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of 
procedure,  we  shall  now  proceed  to  the  election  by 
secret ballot. 

Before we begin the voting process, I should like 
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the 
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no 
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a 
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting. 

We shall now begin the voting process. Members 
are  requested  to  remain  seated  until  all  ballots  have 
been collected. 

Ballot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” will now 
be  distributed.  I  request  representatives  to  use  only 
those ballot papers that have been distributed. 

May I ask representatives to write clearly on the 
ballot  papers  marked  “A”,  for  the  African  and  Asian 
States, the names of the two States for which they wish 
to vote; on the ballot papers marked “B”, for the Latin 
American  and  Caribbean  States,  the  name  of  the  one 
State  for  which  they  wish  to  vote;  and  on  the  ballot 
papers  marked  “C”,  for  the  Western  European  and 
other States, the names of the two States for which they 
wish to vote. 

A  ballot  will  be  declared  invalid  if  it  contains 
more names of Member States from the relevant region 
than  the  number  of  seats  assigned  to  it. A  ballot  will 
also be declared invalid if all the names of the Member 
States  on  that  ballot  do  not  belong  to  the  relevant 
region.  If  a  ballot  paper  contains  names  of  Member 
States  that  do  not  belong  to  that  region,  the  ballot 
remains  valid,  but  only  the  names  of  the  Member 
States  that  belong  to  the  relevant  region  will  be 
counted.  The  names  of  Member  States  that  do  not 
belong to that region will not be counted at all. 

At  the  invitation  of  the  President,  Mr.  Stone 
(Australia),  Ms.  Del  Águila-Castillo  (Guatemala), 
Ms. Kiruthu (Kenya), Ms. Beshimova (Kyrgyzstan),
