Agenda item 103 
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs 
  (b)  Election of eighteen members of the Economic 




and Social Council 
  Letter dated 17 October 2008 from the 
Permanent Representative of Iceland to the 
United Nations addressed to the President of the 
General Assembly (A/63/493) 

The President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly 
will first proceed to a by-election to elect a member of 
the  Economic  and  Social  Council,  in  accordance  with 
rule 140 of the rules of procedure. 

In  this  connection,  I  would  first  like  to  draw  the 
attention of members to document A/63/493, containing a 
letter  dated  17  October  2008  from 
the  Permanent 
Representative  of  Iceland  to  the  United  Nations.  In  his 
letter,  the  Permanent  Representative  announces  that 
Iceland  would  like  to  relinquish  its  seat  on  the 
Economic  and  Social  Council  at  the  end  of  the  year 
2008 for the remainder of its term in favour of Norway. 
As  a  result,  a  vacancy  will  occur  and  a  new  member 
must therefore be elected to fill the unexpired term of 
office of Iceland, commencing on 1 January 2009 and 
expiring on 31 December 2010. 

In  accordance  with  paragraph  4  of  General 
Assembly resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971, 
and taking into account that the vacancy  will occur from 
among  the  Western  European  and  other  States,  the  new 
member should therefore be elected from that region. 

I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  the 
candidate that receives the greatest number of votes by 
a  two-thirds  majority  of  Members  present  and  voting 
will be declared elected. May I take it that the General 
Assembly agrees to that procedure? 
It was so decided. 


The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance 
with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of  procedure  of  the  General 
Assembly,  the  election  shall  be  held  by  secret  ballot 
and  there  shall  be  no  nominations.  We  shall  now 
proceed accordingly. 

I  should  like  to  inform  Members  that,  as  of 
1 January 2009, the following States from the Group of 
Western European and other States will be represented 
on 
the  Economic  and  Social  Council:  Canada, 
Luxembourg,  the  Netherlands,  New  Zealand,  Sweden, 
the  United  Kingdom  of  Great  Britain  and  Northern 
Ireland and the United States of America. The names of 
those  seven  States  should  therefore  not  appear  on  the 
ballot. 

Before we begin the voting process, I should like 
to remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules 
of  procedure  of 
the  General  Assembly,  no 
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a 
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting. 

We shall now begin the voting process. Members 
are  requested  to  remain  seated  until  all  ballots  have 
been collected.

A/63/PV.30 


Allow  me  to  remind  Members  that  they  are  now 
voting  in  the  by-election  for  one  seat  for  the  Western 
European  and  other  States.  The  election  of  the  18 
members  of  the  Council  will  take  place  immediately 
following this by-election. 

Ballot  papers  will  now  be  distributed.  I  request 
representatives  to  use  only  those  ballot  papers  and  to 
write  on  them  the  name  of  the  State  for  which  they 
wish  to  vote.  A  ballot  will  be  declared  invalid  if  it 
contains  the  name  of  more  than  one  Member  State 
from  the  relevant  region  for  the  one  vacant  seat 
assigned to it. A ballot will also be declared invalid if 
the  name  of  the  Member  State  on  that  ballot  does  not 
belong to the relevant region. 
At  the  invitation  of  the  President,  Mr.  Hoxha 
(Albania),  Ms.  Llagostera-Saludes  (Andorra), 
Ms. Corti  (Argentina),  Mr.  Barría  (Panama), 
Ms. Macalintal 
(Philippines),  Mrs.  Adams 
(Vanuatu)  and  Mrs.  Kondolo  (Zambia)  acted  as 
tellers. 
A vote was taken by secret ballot. 
The  meeting  was  suspended  at  10.25  a.m.  and 
resumed at 11.05 a.m.

Consequently,  as  of  1  January  2009, 
I  congratulate  Norway  on  having  been  elected  a

beginning  on  1  January  2009  and  ending  on 
31 December 2010. 

member of the Economic and Social Council. 

The  General  Assembly  will  next  turn  to  the 
election  of  18  members  of  the  Economic  and  Social 
Council to replace those members whose term of office 
expires on 31 December 2008. 

The  18  outgoing  members  are:  Angola,  Austria, 
Benin,  Cuba,  the  Czech  Republic,  France,  Greece, 
Guinea-Bissau,  Guyana,  Haiti,  Japan,  Liechtenstein, 
Madagascar,  Mauritania,  Paraguay,  Portugal,  Saudi 
Arabia and Sri Lanka. Pursuant to rule 146 of the rules 
of procedure, these countries are eligible for immediate 
re-election. 

Members  will  recall  that  Iceland  relinquished  its 
seat  on  the  Economic  and  Social  Council,  effective 
1 January 2009, and that Norway has just been elected 
to fill that vacancy. 

the 
following  States  will  be  represented  on  the  Economic 
and  Social  Council:  Algeria,  Barbados,  Belarus, 
Bolivia,  Brazil,  Canada,  Cameroon,  Cape  Verde, 
the  Congo,  El  Salvador,  Indonesia,  Iraq, 
China, 
Luxembourg,  Malawi,  Malaysia,

the  Russian  Federation,  Saint  Lucia,  Somalia,  the 
Sudan,  Sweden,  the  United  Kingdom  of  Great  Britain 
and Northern Ireland, the United States of America and 
Uruguay.  The  names  of 
these  36  States  should 
therefore not appear on the ballots. 

In  accordance  with  paragraph  4  of  General 
Assembly  resolution  2847  (XXVI)  of  20  December 
1971, and taking into account the number of States that 
will  remain  members  of  the  Council  after  1 January 2009, 
the 18 members should be elected as follows: five from 
African  States,  three  from  Asian  States,  one  from 
Eastern European States, four from Latin American and 
Caribbean States and five from Western European and 
other States. The ballot papers reflect this pattern. 

I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  those 
candidates,  their  number  not  exceeding  the  number  of 
seats  to  be  filled,  who  receive  a  two-thirds  majority 
and  the  greatest  number  of  votes  by  Members  present

May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to 


and voting, will be declared elected. In the case of a tie 
vote  for  a  remaining  seat,  there  will  be  a  special 
restricted  ballot  limited  to  those  candidates  who  have 
obtained an equal number of votes. 

that procedure? 
It was so decided. 

The  Acting  President:  In  accordance  with 

rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall be 
held  by  secret  ballot,  and 
there  shall  be  no 
nominations. 

Regarding candidatures of the respective regional 
Groups, the Secretariat has been informed that  for the 
five  vacant  seats  from  among  the  African  States,  the 
Group  has  endorsed  five  candidates:  Côte  d’Ivoire, 
Guinea-Bissau,  Mauritius,  Morocco  and  Namibia.  For 
the three vacant seats from among the Asian States, the 
Group has endorsed three candidates: India, Japan and 
Saudi Arabia. For the one vacant seat from among the 
Eastern  European  States,  the  Group  has  endorsed 
Estonia.  For  the  four  vacant  seats  from  among  the 
Latin  American  and  Caribbean  States,  the  Group  has 
endorsed four candidates: Guatemala, Peru, Saint Kitts 
and  Nevis  and  the  Bolivarian  Republic  of  Venezuela. 
For  the  five  vacant  seats  from  among  the  Western 
European and other States, the Group has endorsed five 
candidates:  France,  Germany,  Greece,  Liechtenstein 
and Portugal. 

In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of 
procedure,  we  shall  now  proceed  to  the  election  by 
secret ballot. 

Before we begin the voting process, I should like 
to remind Members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules 
of  procedure  of 
the  General  Assembly,  no 
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a 
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting. 

We shall now begin the voting process. 

Ballot papers marked A, B, C, D and E will now 
be  distributed.  I  request  representatives  to  use  only 
those ballot papers and to write on them the names of 
the States for which they wish to vote. 

A  ballot  will  be  declared  invalid  if  it  contains 
more names of Member States from the relevant region 
than  the  number  of  seats  assigned  to  it. A  ballot  will 
also  be  declared  invalid  if  none  of  the  names  of  the 
Member  States  on  that  ballot  belongs  to  the  relevant 
A/63/PV.30
region.  If  a  ballot  paper  of  a  region  contains  some  of 
the names of the Member States that do not belong to 
that region, the ballot remains valid but only the names 
of the Member States that belong to the relevant region 
will  be  counted. The  names  of  Member  States  that  do 
not belong to that region will not be counted at all.
