The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. 

Agenda item 110 (continued) 
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs 
  (b)  Election of eighteen members of the Economic 




and Social Council  
  Letter dated 15 October 2009 from the 
Permanent Representative of the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland to the United Nations addressed to the 
President of the General Assembly (A/64/493)  

The  President  (spoke  in Arabic): The Assembly 
will  first  proceed  to  a  by-election  to  elect  four 
members  of  the  Economic  and  Social  Council,  in 
accordance with rule 140 of the rules of procedure. 
In this connection, I would first like to draw the 

attention  of  members 
to  document  A/64/493, 
containing  the  text  of  a  letter  dated  15  October  2009 
from  the  Permanent  Representative  of  the  United 
Kingdom of  Great Britain and Northern Ireland  to the 
United Nations, as Chairman of the Group of Western 
European  and  other  States  for  the  month  of  October 
2009.  In  his  letter,  the  Chairman  announces  that  New 
Zealand,  Sweden,  Greece  and  Portugal  would  like  to 
relinquish  their  seats  on  the  Economic  and  Social 
Council at the end of the  year 2009 for the remainder 
of  their  terms  in  favour  of  Australia,  Finland,  Malta 
and  Turkey,  respectively.  As  a  result,  four  vacancies 
will  occur  and  four  new  members  must  therefore  be 
elected  to  fill  the  unexpired  terms  of  office  of  New 
Zealand  and  Sweden,  commencing  on  1  January  2010 
and  expiring  on  31  December  2010,  as  well  as  of 
Greece  and  Portugal,  commencing  on  1  January  2010 
and expiring on 31 December 2011. 

In  accordance  with  paragraph  4  of  General 
Assembly  resolution  2847  (XXVI)  of  20  December 
1971,  and  taking  into  account  that  the  vacancies  will 
occur  from  among  the  Western  European  and  other 
States,  the  new  members  should  therefore  be  elected 
from that region. 

I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  the 
candidates  who  receive  a  two-thirds  majority,  and  the 
greatest  number,  of  votes  by  members  present  and 
voting  will  be  declared  elected.  May  I  take  it  that  the 
General Assembly agrees to that procedure? 
It was so decided. 


The  President  (spoke  in  Arabic): In  accordance 
with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall 
be  held  by  secret  ballot  and  there  shall  be  no 
nominations. We shall now proceed accordingly. 

I  should  like  to  inform  members  that,  as  of 
1 January 2010, the following States from the Group of 
Western European and other States will be represented 
on the Economic and Social Council: France, Germany, 
Liechtenstein,  Norway  and  the  United  Kingdom  of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The names of those 
five States should therefore not appear on the ballot. 

Before we begin the voting process, I should like 
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the 
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no

representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a 
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting. 

We shall now begin the voting process. Members 
are  requested  to  remain  seated  until  all  ballots  have 
been collected. 

Allow  me  to  remind  members  that,  at  this  stage, 
they  are  voting  in  the  by-election  for  four  seats  for 
Western European and other States. The election of the 
18 members of the Council will take place immediately 
following this by-election. 

Ballot  papers  will  now  be  distributed.  I  request 
representatives  to  use  only  those  ballot  papers  and  to 
write  on  them  the  names  of  the  four  States  for  which 
they wish to vote. A ballot will be declared invalid if it 
contains  the  names  of  more  than  four  Member  States 
from  the  relevant  region  for  the  four  vacant  seats 
assigned to it. A ballot will also be declared invalid if 
none of the names of the Member States on that ballot 
belongs to the relevant region.

representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a 
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting. 
We shall now begin the voting process. 


Ballot papers marked A, B, C, D and E will now 
be  distributed.  I  request  representatives  to  use  only 
those ballot papers and to write on them the names of 
the States for which they wish to vote. 

A  ballot  will  be  declared  invalid  if  it  contains 
more names of Member States from the relevant region 
than  the  number  of  seats  assigned  to  it. A  ballot  will 
also  be  declared  invalid  if  none  of  the  names  of  the 
Member  States  on  that  ballot  belongs  to  the  relevant 
region.  If  a  ballot  paper  of  a  region  contains  some  of 
the names of the Member States that do not belong to 
that  region,  the  ballot  remains  valid,  but  only  the 
names of the Member States that belong to the relevant 
region  will  be  counted.  The  names  of  Member  States 
that do not belong to that region will not be counted at 
all.

resumed at 12.35 p.m. 
The  President:  The  result  of  the  voting  is  as 



May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to 


1971, and taking into account the number of States that 
will  remain  members  of  the  Council  after  1  January 
2010,  the  18  members  should  be  elected  as  follows: 
five  from African  States,  four  from Asian  States,  two 
from  Eastern  European  States, 
three  from  Latin 
American and Caribbean States and four from Western 
European  and  other  States.  The  ballot  papers  reflect 
that pattern. 

I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  those 
candidates,  their  number  not  exceeding  the  number  of 
seats  to  be  filled,  who  receive  a  two-thirds  majority, 
and the greatest number, of votes by members present 
and voting will be declared elected. In the case of a tie 
vote  for  a  remaining  seat,  there  will  be  a  special 
restricted  ballot  limited  to  those  candidates  that  have 
obtained an equal number of votes. 

that procedure?

The  President  (spoke  in  Arabic):  In  accordance

Regarding candidatures of the respective regional 
Groups, the Secretariat has been informed that  for the 
five  vacant  seats  from  among  the  African  States,  the 
Group  has  endorsed  five  candidates:  the  Comoros, 
Ghana,  Egypt,  Rwanda  and  Zambia.  For  the  four 
vacant  seats  from  among  the Asian  States,  the  Group 
has  endorsed 
Iraq, 
Mongolia and the Philippines. For the two vacant seats 
from  among  the  Eastern  European  States,  the  Group 
has  endorsed  two  candidates:  Slovakia  and  Ukraine. 
For  the  three  vacant  seats  from  among  the  Latin 
American  and  Caribbean  States, 
the  Group  has 
endorsed three candidates: Argentina, the Bahamas and 
Chile.  For  the  four  vacant  seats  from  among  the 
Western  European  and  other  States,  the  Group  has 
endorsed  four  candidates:  Belgium,  Canada,  Italy  and
