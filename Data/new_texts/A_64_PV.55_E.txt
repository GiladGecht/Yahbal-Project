the  First  Committee, 
Reports of the First Committee 
The  President: The  General Assembly  will  now 

take  up  the  reports  of  the  First  Committee  on  agenda 
items 86 to 103, 118 and 133. 
I  now  request  Ms.  Tetyana  Pokhval’ona  of 

Ukraine,  Rapporteur  of 
to 
introduce  the  reports  of  the  First  Committee  in  one 
intervention. 
Ms.  Pokhval’ona  (Ukraine),  Rapporteur  of  the 

First  Committee:  It  gives  me  great  pleasure 
to 
introduce  to  the  General  Assembly  the  reports  of  the 
First  Committee  on  agenda  items  86  to  103  and  118 
and  133.  Those  reports  are  contained  in  documents 
A/64/381 through A/64/400. 

In response to the General Assembly’s appeal, the 
First  Committee  continued  to  fully  utilize  its  existing 
resources  and  was  able  to  conclude  its  work  at  the 
current  session  in  four  weeks  and  one  day,  with  23 
formal  meetings.  The  work  of  the  Committee  at  the 
present session could be  characterized  as procedurally 
smooth  and  substantively  constructive,  more  focused 
and action-oriented than in past sessions. 

The  First  Committee  had  before  it  49  draft 
resolutions  and  5  draft  decisions  submitted  under 
various  disarmament  and  related  international  security 
agenda items for its consideration. Of all adopted texts, 
29  draft  resolutions  and  4  draft  decisions,  or  almost 
60 per cent, were adopted without a vote. 
related 
As  at  previous  sessions,  the  whole  complex  of 

issues 
to  weapons  of  mass  destruction, 
particularly nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation 
issues,  including  the  prevention  of  terrorists  from 
acquiring  nuclear  technologies  and  other  weapons  of 
mass  destruction,  were  by  far  the  most  important 
subjects.  Out  of  the  54  adopted  draft  texts,  19  draft 
resolutions  were  on  nuclear  issues  and  3  on  other 
weapons of mass destruction. 

Turning  to  the  meetings  of  the  First  Committee, 
several  new  trends  were  evident.  First,  statements 
made by the delegations were devoted due attention to 
the  existing  stockpiles  of  weapons,  in  general,  and 
weapons  of  mass  destruction,  in  particular.  While  the 
focus  was  on  nuclear,  chemical,  biological  weapons 
and on small arms and light weapons, a renewed sense 
of urgency and readiness to act with an unprecedented 
degree  of  cooperation  on  all  outstanding  disarmament 
and related issues was clearly visible. 

On the one hand, that development is the result of 
an  ongoing  process  of  reconsideration  of  positions  by 
Member States on disarmament and security issues. On 
the  other  hand,  it  is  rooted  in  comprehension  of  the 
need 
to  redouble  efforts  aimed  at  working  out 
substantive and tangible disarmament measures. 

It  was  this  new  action-oriented  approach  that 
provided  a  background  for  discussions  on  the  entire 
complex  of  issues  related  to  nuclear  weapons.  Thus, 
Member  States  increasingly  focused  on  aspects  of 
nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament that 
need  to  be  addressed  on  a  priority  basis  in  the

immediate  future.  In  that  context,  delegations  focused 
on  the  further  efforts  needed  to  scale  down  nuclear 
weapons at both the unilateral and the bilateral levels. 
They  noted  that  in  the  atmosphere  of  reasonable 
expectations, which is prevailing in anticipation of the 
Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, it is even more 
important  to  take  a  fresh  look  at  nuclear  disarmament 
with  a  view  to  adopting  new  innovative  and  daring 
approaches. 

Here,  the  practical  underpinnings  of  operative 
military postures and measures for preventing weapons 
from  falling  into  the  hands  of  terrorists  were  highly 
visible. Those  concerns  were  reflected  in a number  of 
draft resolutions regarding, inter alia, the conclusion of 
a  convention  on  the  prohibition  of  the  use  of  nuclear 
weapons, 
renewed 
determination  to  achieve  the  total  elimination  of 
the 
nuclear  weapons, 
disarmament, 
Comprehensive  Nuclear-Test-Ban  Treaty  and 
the 
Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty. 

For  the  first  time,  the  draft  resolution  on  the 
Comprehensive 
was 
co-sponsored  by  all  permanent  members  of 
the 
Security  Council.  After  10  years  of  failure  and 
disappointment, 
the  Conference  on  Disarmament 
adopted  its  programme  of  work,  which  includes  the 
difficult  issue  of  the  fissile  material  cut-off  treaty. 
Finally,  substantive  discussion  has  started  on  an  arms 
trade  treaty,  which  resulted  in  adoption  of  a  draft 
resolution  on  the  subject  with  overwhelming  support 
from  Member  States.  In  addition  to  the  agreement  on 
the  fissile  material  cut-off  treaty,  a  number  of  events 
contributed to this end, in particular, the decision of the 
Russian  Federation  and  the  United  States  to  renew 
negotiations  on  further  reduction  of  their  nuclear 
arsenals and the successful conclusion of a meeting on 
article  XIV  of  the  Comprehensive  Nuclear-Test-Ban 
Treaty  in  New  York.  Those  are  just  two  important 
developments, but there are many others. 
Visible  progress  in  the  area  of  weapons  of  mass 

destruction 
in 
particular  did  not  overshadow  or  somehow  diminish 
the 
importance  of  other  vital  disarmament  and 
international  security  issues  such  as  small  arms  and 
light  weapons,  the  universalization  of  existing  legal 
instruments and the role assigned to multilateralism in 
disarmament.  On  the  contrary,  draft  resolutions  on

those issues enjoyed the increasing support of Member 
States. 

The  overall  tone  of  the  concrete  results-oriented 
approach  was  clearly  evident  during  the  thematic 
debate 
interactive 
dialogues  with  the  participation  of  high-level  officials 
of major international disarmament bodies, such as the 
International  Atomic  Energy  Agency,  the  Preparatory 
Commission  for  the  Comprehensive  Nuclear-Test-Ban 
Treaty  Organization, 
the 
Prohibition  of  Chemical  Weapons,  the  Conference  on 
Disarmament  and  others,  were  also  aimed  at  the 
conceptual  and  practical  aspects  of  national  and 
international security. 
the  general  debate,  100 

four  observers  and  one 
delegations, 
representative  of 
agency,  made 
specialized 
statements. Among those speaking, six spoke on behalf 
of  various  groups.  More  than  140  delegations  made 
statements  within  the  framework  of  the  thematic 
discussions.  These  numbers  that  I  have  cited  are 
unprecedented.  Another  contributing  factor  was  the 
sustained level of support from civil society for greater 
progress on a wide range of disarmament issues. 

Before  concluding,  I  should  like  to  pay  a  well 
deserved  tribute  to  all  delegations  for  their  active 
participation  in  the  work  of  the  Committee  and  for 
their spirit of cooperation  in the common search  for  a 
better,  safer  and  more  stable  world.  I  should  like  to 
express  special  gratitude  to  the  Chairman  of  the  First 
Committee,  Mr.  José  Luis  Cancela,  who,  with  his 
comprehensive  knowledge  of  disarmament 
and 
international  security  matters  as  well  as  his  general 
diplomatic skills, led the proceedings of the Committee 
with vision and able leadership. Let me also, on behalf 
of  the  Committee  and  on  my  own  behalf,  extend  our 
sincere  gratitude  to  the  Committee’s  Vice-Chairmen, 
Ambassador  Hilario  Davide  of 
the  Philippines, 
Mr. Hossam  Aly  of  Egypt  and  Mr.  Florian  Laudi  of 
Germany,  for  their  most  effective  contribution  to  the 
work  of  the  Committee.  I  should  also  like  to  express 
to  Mr.  Sergio  Duarte,  High 
my  appreciation 
Representative 
and 
Mr. Shaaban  Muhammad  Shaaban,  Under-Secretary-
General 
for  General  Assembly  and  Conference 
Management, for their leadership and contributions, as 
well  as  to  the  Secretariat  staff  that  assisted  the 
Committee.

Moreover,  special 



the  Acting 
Secretary of the First Committee, Mr. Timur Alasaniya, 
whose vast experience and high degree of competence 
made  a  significant  contribution  to  the  successful 
outcome of the Committee’s work. In that connection I 
should also like to express my gratitude to Mr. Sergei 
Cherniavsky,  Ms.  Emer  Herity,  Ms.  Tatyana 
Shestakova  and  other  members  of  the  Secretariat  for 
their valuable assistance to the Committee. 

With these brief remarks, I present the reports of 
the  First  Committee  to  the  General  Assembly  for 
consideration and approval, as contained in documents 
A/64/381 through A/64/400. 
The  President:  I  thank  the  Rapporteur  of  the 

First  Committee  for  her  introduction  of  the  reports  of 
the Committee. 

If  there  is  no  proposal  under  rule  66  of  the 
Assembly’s  rules  of  procedure,  I  shall  take  it  that  the 
General Assembly decides not to discuss the reports of 
the First Committee that are before it today. 
It was so decided. 

The  President:  Statements  will  therefore  be 

limited  to  explanations  of  vote.  The  positions  of 
delegations regarding the recommendations of the First 
Committee have been made clear in the Committee and 
are reflected in the relevant official records. 

May  I  remind  members  that,  in  accordance  with 
General  Assembly  decision  34/401,  a  delegation 
should,  as  far  as  possible,  explain  its  vote  only  once, 
that is, either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, 
unless  that  delegation’s  vote  in  plenary  meeting  is 
different  from  its  vote  in  the  Committee,  and  that 
explanations  of  vote  are  limited  to  10  minutes  and 
should be made by delegations from their seats. 

the 
recommendations  contained  in  the  reports  of  the  First 
Committee, I should like to advise representatives that 
we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same 
manner  as  was  done  in  the  Committee,  unless  the 
Assembly is notified otherwise in advance. This means 
that  where  separate  or  recorded  votes  were  taken,  we 
will  do  the  same.  I  should  also  hope  that  we  may 
proceed 
those 
recommendations  that  were  adopted  without  a  vote  in 
the First Committee.

Before  proceeding  further,  I  would  like  to  draw 
the  attention  of  members  to  a  note  by  the  Secretariat 
entitled  “Situation  reports  of  the  First  Committee  on 
agenda items 86 to 103”, which has been circulated in 
English  only  as  document  A/C.1/64/INF/3.  This  note 
has  been  distributed  desk-to-desk  in  the  General 
Assembly  Hall  as  the  reference  guide  for  action  on 
draft  resolutions  and  decisions  recommended  by  the 
First  Committee  in  its  reports.  In  that  connection, 
members will find in column 2 of the note the numbers 
of  the  draft  resolutions  or  decisions  of  the  First 
Committee, with the corresponding numbers for action 
in the plenary in column 5 of the same note.

additional  sponsors  are  no  longer  accepted,  now  that 
draft  resolutions  and  decisions  have  been  adopted  in 
the Committee. Any clarification about co-sponsorship 
in  the  Committee  reports  should  be  addressed  to  the 
Secretary of the Committee. 
Furthermore,  members

Agenda item 93 
Conclusion of effective international arrangements to

threat of use of nuclear weapons 
  Report of the First Committee (A/64/388) 

The  President: The  Assembly  has  before  it  a 

draft  resolution  recommended  by  the  First  Committee 
in paragraph 7 of its report. 
Mr. Tarar (Pakistan): Before we proceed to take 

action on the draft resolution, we would like to make a 
very  slight  oral  revision  to  the  fourteenth  preambular 
paragraph  of  the  text.  We  would  like  to  change 
“Fourteenth  Conference”  to  “Fourteenth  and  Fifteenth 
Conferences”,  and,  further  down,  to  change  “Havana” 
to  read  “Havana  and  Sharm  el-Sheikh,  Egypt,”. 
Immediately  following 
that,  after  “16  September 
2006”, insert “and 16 July 2009, respectively”. This is 
just a minor technical revision. 
The  President: We  will  now  take  a  decision  on 

the draft resolution, as orally revised. A recorded vote 
has been requested.

The  President:  We 
turn  next 
to 
the  draft 

decisions  recommended  by  the  First  Committee  in 
paragraph  82  of  its  report  contained  in  document 
A/64/391. 
Draft  decision  I  is  entitled  “Convening  of  the 

fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted 
to  disarmament”.  The  First  Committee  adopted  it 
without a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes 
to do the same? 
Draft decision I was adopted. 

The  President:  Draft  decision  II  is  entitled 

“Preventing the acquisition by terrorists of radioactive 
materials and sources”. The First Committee adopted it 
without a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes 
to do the same? 
Draft decision II was adopted. 

The  President:  I  shall  now  give  the  floor  to 

speakers  who  wish  to  speak  in  explanation  of  vote  or 
position  following  the  adoption  of  the  resolutions  and 
decisions on which the Assembly has just taken action. 
Mr.  Hallak  (Syrian  Arab  Republic)  (spoke  in 

Arabic): My country voted in favour of resolution 64/52, 
entitled  “Second  Conference  of  States  Parties  and 
Signatories to Treaties that Establish Nuclear-Weapon-
Free  Zones  and  Mongolia”.  My  country  supports  the 
noble  principle  of  emphasizing  the  importance  of 
special  agreements  pertaining  to  the  establishment  of 
nuclear-weapon-free zones throughout the world.  

In  that  connection,  I  should  like  to  refer  to  our 
firmly  held  belief  in  the  importance  of  establishing  a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, given the 
importance  of  doing  so  to  regional  and  international 
26 

09-62827 
in 
regions 
that  have  successfully 


peace  and  security.  We  would  like  to  congratulate  the 
countries 
rid 
themselves of nuclear weapons, and we look forward to 
the  fulfilment  of  a  similar  request  to  establish  a 
nuclear-weapon-free  zone  in  the  Middle  East.  I  recall 
that on 29 December 2002, Syria, on behalf of the Arab 
Group,  submitted  a  proposal  to  the  Security  Council 
that  would  rid  the  Middle  East  of  weapons  of  mass 
destruction, 
in  particular  nuclear  weapons.  That 
important initiative continues to await implementation.  

The  failure  to  achieve  a  nuclear-weapon-free 
zone in the Middle East stands as a stark illustration of 
the  use  of  double  standards  and  a  lack  of  sincere 
political  will  on  the  part  of  some.  Israel  is  continuing 
its  aggressive  military  policy  of  building  up  its  large 
arsenal  of  both  conventional  and  non-conventional 
weapons  and  weapons  of  mass  destruction, 
in 
particular nuclear weapons and their means of delivery. 

Israel is conducting a dangerous nuclear military 
programme that threatens the security of the region and 
the  world.  It  is  doing  so  completely  without  effective 
supervision  and  in  the  absence  of  an  international 
response  to  its  dangerous  attitude.  It  is  therefore 
enjoying  an  immoral  impunity,  which  allows  it  to 
undermine  all  efforts  for  nuclear  disarmament  and 
non-proliferation  of  nuclear  weapons  in  the  Middle 
East. That makes the region more vulnerable to threats 
and  injustices  and  falsifies  truth,  serving  to  exempt 
Israel  from  the  principles  of  international  law  and  the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) regime.  

For  all  these  reasons,  my  delegation  wishes  to 
record  its  opposition  to  the  phrase  in  the  fourth 
preambular  paragraph,  “agreements  freely  arrived  at 
among  the  States  of  the  region  concerned”.  That 
means, by definition, that a nuclear-free zone cannot be 
established  in  the  Middle  East,  because  Israel  has  no 
interest in such an endeavour. As is well known, there 
are 
the 
establishment  of  a  nuclear-free  zone  in  the  Middle 
East,  set  out  in  the  resolution  on  the  Middle  East 
adopted  at  the  NPT  Review  Conference  in  1995 
(NPT/CONF.1995/32 (Part I), Annex). Non-mention of 
this  reference  gives  Israel  more  room  to  avoid  and 
evade  the  commitment  to  the  establishment  of  such  a 
nuclear-free zone. 
Mr.  Chatel  (France)  (spoke  in  French):  I  would 

like to speak briefly on agenda item 96, especially with 
regard 
the  relationship 
to  resolutions  64/32,  on 
terms  of 
regarding

recognition

Mr.  Torres  (Colombia)  (spoke 
between disarmament and development, and 64/33, on 
observance  of  environmental  norms  in  agreements  on 
disarmament  and  arms  control.  My  delegation  wishes 
to  specify  that  we  did  not  participate  in  the  decisions 
on those two resolutions for reasons already alluded to 
in the First Committee. 
in  Spanish): 

Colombia voted in favour of resolution 64/48, entitled 
“The arms trade treaty”, because it is convinced of the 
need  for  a  universal, 
instrument 
regulating  the  illicit  traffic  in  conventional  arms, 
including small arms and light weapons, munitions and 
explosives,  to  prevent  them  from  being  diverted  to 
illegal markets.  

In  both  the  Group  of  Governmental  Experts  and 
in 
the  Open-ended  Working  Group,  my  country 
expressed its opinion that an arms trade treaty must be 
based, 
that  arms  control, 
disarmament  and  non-proliferation  are  essential 
elements for international peace and security; secondly, 
on respect for international law, including human rights 
norms  and  international  humanitarian  law;  thirdly,  on 
respect  for  the  principles  enshrined  in  the  Charter  of 
the  United  Nations,  particularly  the  inherent  right  to 
self-defence, sovereignty, equality of all Members and 
non-intervention in internal affairs; and fourthly, on the 
right  of  all  States  to  produce,  export,  import,  transfer 
and  possess  conventional  weapons  for  their  legitimate 
self-defence.  

Colombia  is  aware  that  an  arms  trade  treaty 
without  the  participation  of  all  States,  particularly 
those  playing  a  significant  role  in  the  sale,  purchase 
and  transfer  of  arms,  will  affect  both  its  effectiveness 
and  its  full  implementation.  Likewise,  it  makes  no 
sense  to  negotiate  an  instrument  of  this  kind  at  the 
global  level  if  it  does  not  establish  effective  controls 
over  the  transfer  of  arms  that  go  beyond  existing 
regulations  and 
thus  does  not  create  greater 
transparency.  

In  the  view  of  my  delegation,  the  absence  of 
controls on the transfer of arms to non-State actors has 
a  negative  effect  on  the  internal  security  of  States, 
since such arms can be used to undermine institutions 
and  the  rule  of  law  and  to  commit  crimes  against 
humanity  and  serious  violations  of 
international 
humanitarian law. That is why Colombia has advocated 
and will continue to advocate the inclusion in the arms

trade treaty of the explicit prohibition of such transfers 
by establishing stricter control mechanisms.  

Colombia  is  pleased  that  these  principles  are 
reflected in resolution 64/48, entitled, “The arms trade 
treaty”,  which 
just  adopted  by  a 
considerable majority. We reiterate our commitment to 
the  work  of  the  preparatory  committee  established  in 
that  resolution  and  to  the  search,  whenever  possible, 
for  consensus 
lead  discussions  and 
negotiations to a positive conclusion in the adoption of 
an  arms  trade  treaty  at  the  conference  scheduled  for 
2012.  

Finally,  my  delegation  wishes  to  refer  to  the 
adoption  of  decisions  by  consensus  in  the  framework 
of  the  conference  that  will  negotiate  the  arms  trade 
treaty.  Colombia  is  concerned  about  the  interpretation 
that  could  be  given  to  paragraph  5  of  the  resolution. 
While  for  Colombia  it  is  certainly  necessary  to  seek 
agreements that permit progress towards an arms trade 
treaty, we must not lose sight of the fact that consensus 
can become an obstacle to decision-making.

(Cuba) 

Spanish):  My  delegation  wishes  to  explain  its  vote  on 
resolution  64/54,  on  transparency  in  armaments.  Cuba 
abstained  in  the  vote  on  the  resolution  as  a  whole,  as 
well as in the separate votes on operative paragraphs 3 
and 6.  

in 
armaments is an important factor in building a climate 
of  trust  and  in  decreasing  tensions  among  States,  and 
we  believe 
the  United  Nations  Register  of 
Conventional  Arms  is  a  concrete  measure  that  can 
contribute to that objective. However, we observe with 
concern  the  ever-increasing  emphasis  on  including  in 
the  Register  information  on  small  arms  and  light 
weapons  while  there  is  absolutely  no  progress  on 
including information on weapons of mass destruction, 
especially nuclear weapons.  
We have always stressed the need for the Register 

to  be  balanced,  holistic  and  non-discriminatory.  The 
inclusion  of  requests  for  information  on  weapons  of 
mass  destruction  and  transfers  of  equipment  and 
technology 
the 
development  and  production  of  such  weapons  would 
make  the  Register  a  more  balanced  instrument  and 
would  facilitate  its  becoming  universal.  The  Register 
cannot  be  an  end  in  itself.  It  must  be  a  means  of 
moving  towards  the  objective  of  greater  security  on

(A/64/296)  have  practical  implications  that  are  very

their  very 
implications, 
require  comprehensive  analysis  by 
several national bodies linked to the issues of national 
security within States. We underline the importance of 
using  transparent  and  participatory  procedures.  In  no 
way should acceptance of the recommendations of the 
Group of Governmental Experts be forced on Member 
States  without  previously  giving  them  the  opportunity 
to express their views on them and exchange opinions.  

With respect to the closed Group of Experts that 
convenes  every  three  years  on  the  question  of  the 
Register, we wish to express once again our concern at 
the way in which the concerns of many States are being 
ignored  while  a  few  States  are  benefiting,  without 
taking into account the reasoning and arguments of all. 
That  is  not  a  healthy  or  truly  multilateral  way  of 
attaining  the  necessary  consensus  on  such  a  delicate 
subject for international peace and security. 

Even  though  my  delegation  voted  in  favour  of 
operative  paragraph  6  (d),  we  wish  to  put  on  record 
that, despite the interest expressed by Cuba in being a 
member of that Group in 2005, no Cuban experts were 
included  in  it.  We  hope  that  in 
the  future  the 
composition  of  this  and  other  groups  of  experts 
established  in  accordance  with  resolutions  adopted  on 
the  recommendation  of  the  First  Committee  will  take 
into  due  account  the  interest  of  all  Member  States  in 
participating.  
The  President:  The  General  Assembly  has  thus 

concluded  this  stage  of  its  consideration  of  agenda 
item 96. 

Agenda item 97
