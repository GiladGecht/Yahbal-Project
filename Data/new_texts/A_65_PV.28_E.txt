Agenda item 111 
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs 
  (a)  Election of five non-permanent members of the 
Security Council 
The  President  (spoke  in  French):  The  General 

Assembly  will  now  proceed  to  the  election  of  five 
non-permanent  members  of  the  Security  Council  to 
replace those members whose term of office expires on 
31 December 2010. 

The  five  outgoing  non-permanent  members  are 
the  following:  Austria,  Japan,  Mexico,  Turkey  and 
Uganda.  Those  five  States  cannot  be  re-elected.  Their 
names,  therefore,  should  not  appear  on  the  ballot 
papers. 

Apart  from  the  five  permanent  members,  the 
Security  Council  will  include  in  the  year  2011  the 
following  States:  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina,  Brazil, 
Gabon,  Lebanon  and  Nigeria.  The  names  of  those 
States,  therefore,  should  also  not  appear  on  the  ballot 
papers. 

Of  the  five  non-permanent  members  that  will 
remain in office in the year 2011, three are from Africa 
and Asia, one is from Eastern Europe and one is from 
Latin  America  and 
the  Caribbean.  Consequently, 
pursuant 
to  paragraph  3  of  General  Assembly 
resolution  1991  A  (XVIII),  of  17  December  1963,  the 
five  non-permanent  members  should  be  elected 
according  to  the  following  pattern:  two  from  Africa 

and  Asia,  one  from  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean 
and  two  from  Western  Europe  and  other  States.  The 
ballot papers reflect that pattern. 

In  accordance  with  established  practice,  there  is 
an understanding to the effect that, of the two States to 
be  elected  from  Africa  and  Asia,  one  should  be  from 
Africa and one from Asia. 

I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  those 
candidates  —  their  number  not  exceeding  the  number 
of seats to be filled — receiving the greatest number of 
votes  and  a  two-thirds  majority  of  those  present  and 
voting,  will  be  declared  elected.  If  the  number  of 
candidates receiving a two-thirds majority is less than 
the number of members to be elected, we will proceed 
to  a  restricted  ballot  limited  to  those  candidates  that 
have  obtained  the  greatest  number  of  votes  in  the 
previous  ballot,  which  should  not  be  more  than  twice 
the seats remaining to be filled. 

that procedure? 
It was so decided. 

The  President  (spoke  in  French):  In  accordance 

with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall 
be  held  by  secret  ballot  and  there  shall  be  no 
nominations. 

Regarding candidatures, I have been informed by 
the  Chairpersons  of  the  respective  regional  groups  of 
the following. For the two vacant seats from among the 
African  and  Asian  States,  two  candidates  have  been 
designated,  namely,  South  Africa  and  India.  For  the

one  vacant  seat  from  among  the  Latin  American  and 
Caribbean  States,  there  is  one  endorsed  candidate, 
namely,  Colombia.  For  the  two  vacant  seats  from 
among  the  Western  European  and  other  States,  there 
are  three  candidates,  namely,  Canada,  Germany  and 
Portugal.  

In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of 
procedure,  we  shall  now  proceed  to  the  election  by 
secret ballot. 

Before we begin the voting process, I should like 
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the 
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no 
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a 
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting. 
We shall now begin the voting process. Members 

are  requested  to  remain  seated  until  all  ballots  have 
been collected. 

Ballot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” will now 
be  distributed.  I  request  representatives  to  use  only 
those ballot papers that have been distributed. 

May I ask representatives to write clearly on the 
ballot  papers  marked  “A”,  for  the  African  and  Asian 
States, the names of the two States for which they wish 
to vote; on the ballot papers marked “B”, for the Latin 
American  and  Caribbean  States,  the  name  of  the  one 
State  for  which  they  wish  to  vote;  and  on  the  ballot 
papers  marked  “C”,  for  the  Western  European  and 
other States, the names of the two States for which they 
wish to vote. 
A  ballot  will  be  declared  invalid  if  it  contains 

more names of Member States from the relevant region 
than  the  number  of  seats  assigned  to  it.  A  ballot  will 
also be declared invalid if all the names of the Member 
States  on  that  ballot  do  not  belong  to  the  relevant 
region.  If  a  ballot  paper  contains  names  of  Member 
States  that  do  not  belong  to  that  region,  the  ballot 
remains  valid,  but  only  the  names  of  the  Member 
States  that  belong  to  the  relevant  region  will  be 
counted.  The  names  of  Member  States  that  do  not 
belong to that region will not be counted at all. 

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Babadoudou 
(Benin),  Mr.  Toba 
(Brazil),  Mr.  Kahiluoto 
(Finland),  Ms.  Satomi  (Japan),  Mr.  Weydert 
(Luxembourg) and Ms. Stoica (Romania) acted as 
tellers. 
A vote was taken by secret ballot.
