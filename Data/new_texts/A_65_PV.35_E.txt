35th plenary meeting 
Monday, 25 October 2010, 10 a.m. 
New York 





President: Mr. Deiss 
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
(Switzerland) 

In  accordance  with  paragraph  4  of  General 
Assembly  resolution  2847  (XXVI),  of  20  December 
1971,  and  taking  into  account  that  the  vacancies  will 
occur from among the Group of Western European and 
other  States,  the  new  members  should  therefore  be 
elected from that region. 

I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  the 
candidates  that  receive  the  greatest  number  of  votes 
and  a  two-thirds  majority  of  the  votes  by  members 
present and voting will be declared elected. May I take 
it that the General Assembly agrees to that procedure? 
It was so decided. 

The  President  (spoke  in  French):  In  accordance 

with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of  procedure  of  the  General 
Assembly,  the  election  shall  be  held  by  secret  ballot 
and  there  shall  be  no  nominations.  We  shall  now 
proceed accordingly. 

I  should  like  to  inform  members  that,  as  of 
1 January 2011, the following States from the Group of 
Western European and other States will be represented 
on 
the  Economic  and  Social  Council:  Belgium, 
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Malta and the United 
States  of  America.  The  names  of  those  seven  States 
should therefore not appear on the ballot. 

Before we begin the voting process, I should like 
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the 
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no 
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a 
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting. 





  The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m. 

Agenda item 111 (continued) 
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs 
  (b)  Election of eighteen members of the Economic 




and Social Council 
  Letter dated 30 September 2010 from the 
Permanent Representative of Denmark to the 
United Nations addressed to the President of the 
General Assembly (A/65/526) 
The President (spoke in French): The Assembly 

will first proceed to a by-election to elect members of 
the  Economic  and  Social  Council,  in  accordance  with 
rule 140 of the rules of procedure. 

In that connection, I would first like to draw the 
attention  of  members  to  document  A/65/526,  which 
contains  a  letter  dated  30  September  2010  from  the 
Permanent  Representative  of  Denmark  to  the  United 
Nations.  In  his  letter,  the  Permanent  Representative 
announces, in his capacity as the Chair of the Group of 
Western  European  and  other  States,  that  Turkey  will 
relinquish its seat on the Economic and Social Council 
at  the  end  of  2010  for  the  remainder  of  its  term  in 
favour of Spain, and that Liechtenstein will relinquish 
its  seat  on  the  Council  at  the  end  of  2010  for  the 
remainder  of  its  term  in  favour  of  Switzerland.  As  a 
result,  two  vacancies  will  occur  and  new  members 
must therefore be elected to fill the unexpired terms of 
office  of  Liechtenstein  and  Turkey,  commencing  on 
1 January 2011 and expiring on 31 December 2011.

We shall now begin the voting process. Members 
are  requested  to  remain  seated  until  all  ballots  have 
been collected. 

Allow  me  to  remind  members  that  they  are  now 
voting in the by-election for two seats for the Group of 
Western  European  and  other  States.  The  election  of 
eighteen  members  of  the  Council  will  take  place 
immediately following this by-election. 

Ballot  papers  will  now  be  distributed.  I  request 
representatives  to  use  only  those  ballot  papers  that 
have been distributed and to write on them the name of 
the  two  States  for  which  they  wish  to  vote.  A  ballot 
will  be  declared  invalid  if  it  contains  the  names  of 
more than two Member States from the relevant region 
for  the  two  vacant  seats  assigned  to  it.  A  ballot  will 
also be declared invalid if the name of a Member State 
on that ballot does not belong to the relevant region. 

At  the  invitation  of  the  President,  Ms.  Francisco 
(Angola),  Mr.  Babić  (Croatia),  Ms.  Maskay 
(France),  Ms.  Del  Águila-Castillo  (Guatemala), 
Mr.  Visonnavong 
(Lao  People’s  Democratic 
Republic) and Mr. Dosseh (Togo) acted as tellers. 
A vote was taken by secret ballot. 
The  meeting  was  suspended  at  10.25  a.m.  and 
resumed at 10.50 a.m.

in 
its  candidacy 
for  membership 
Having obtained the required two-thirds majority, 
Spain  and  Switzerland  were  elected  members  of 
the  Economic  and  Social  Council  for  a  term  of 
office  beginning  on  1  January  2011  and  ending 
on 31 December 2011. 
The  President  (spoke  in  French):  I  congratulate 

Spain  and  Switzerland  on  having  been  elected 
members of the Economic and Social Council. 

The  General  Assembly  will  next  turn  to  the 
election  of  eighteen  members  of  the  Economic  and 
Social  Council  to  replace  those  members  whose  term 
of office expires on 31 December 2010. 
I give the floor to the representative of Nepal. 

Mr. Rai (Nepal): I have the honour to inform this 

body  that  the  Government  of  Nepal  has  decided  to 
withdraw 
the 
Economic  and  Social  Council  for  the  period  2011  to 
2013, for which the election is now being held. 

Allow me also to report that my Government has 
decided to present its candidacy for membership in the 
Economic  and  Social  Council  for  the  period  2013  to 
2015. My Government would like to express its sincere 
gratitude 
that  have  already 
expressed their support for our candidacy. 
The  President  (spoke  in  French):  The  eighteen 

outgoing  members  are:  Australia,  Brazil,  Cameroon, 
China, Congo, Finland, Malaysia, Mozambique, Niger, 
Norway,  Pakistan,  Poland,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  the 
Republic  of  Moldova,  the  Russian  Federation,  Saint 
Lucia,  the  United  Kingdom  of  Great  Britain  and 
Northern Ireland and Uruguay. Pursuant to rule 146 of 
the rules of procedure, those countries are  eligible for 
immediate re-election. 

Members will recall that Liechtenstein and Turkey 
relinquished  their  seats  on  the  Council,  effective  1 
January 2011, and that Spain and Switzerland have just 
been elected to fill those vacancies. 

Consequently, as of 1 January 2011, the following 
States will be represented on the Economic and Social 
Council:  Argentina, 
the  Bahamas,  Bangladesh, 
Belgium,  Canada,  Chile,  Comoros,  Côte  d’Ivoire, 
Egypt,  Estonia,  France,  Germany,  Ghana,  Guatemala,

to 
limited 
those  candidates 
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to 


United  States  of America,  the  Bolivarian  Republic  of 
Venezuela  and  Zambia.  The  names  of  those  36  States 
should therefore not appear on the ballots. 

In  accordance  with  paragraph  4  of  General 
Assembly  resolution  2847  (XXVI),  of  20  December 
1971, and taking into account the number of States that 
will  remain  members  of  the  Council  after  1  January 
2011,  the  18  members  should  be  elected  as  follows: 
four from African States, four from Asian States, three 
from  Eastern  European  States, 
three  from  Latin 
American and Caribbean States and four from Western 
European  and  other  States.  The  ballot  papers  reflect 
that pattern. 

I should like to inform the General Assembly that 
those  candidates  —  their  number  not  exceeding  the 
number of seats to be filled — that receive a two-thirds 
majority and the greatest number of votes by members 
present and voting, will be declared elected. In the case 
of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be a special 
restricted  ballot 
that 
obtained an equal number of votes. 

that procedure? 
It was so decided. 

The  President  (spoke  in  French):  In  accordance 

with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall 
be  held  by  secret  ballot  and  there  shall  be  no 
nominations. 

With  regard  to  candidatures  of  the  respective 
regional  Groups,  the  Secretariat  has  been  informed  of 
the  following.  For  the  four  vacant  seats  from  among 
the  African  States,  the  Group  has  endorsed  four 
candidates:  Cameroon,  Gabon,  Malawi  and  Senegal. 
For the four vacant seats from among the Asian States, 
there  are  five  candidates:  Bahrain,  China,  Pakistan, 
Qatar and the Republic of Korea. For the three vacant 
seats  from  among  the  Eastern  European  States,  the 
Group  has  endorsed  Hungary,  Latvia  and  the  Russian 
Federation. For the three vacant seats from among the 
Latin  American  and  Caribbean  States,  the  Group  has 
endorsed 
three  candidates:  Ecuador,  Mexico  and 
Nicaragua.  For  the  four  vacant  seats  from  among  the 
Western  European  and  other  States,  the  Group  has 
endorsed  four  candidates:  Australia,  Finland,  Norway 
and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland.

In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of 
procedure,  we  shall  now  proceed  to  the  election  by 
secret ballot. 

Before we begin the voting process, I should like 
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the 
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no 
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a 
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting. 
We shall now begin the voting process. 


Ballot papers marked A, B, C, D and E will now 
be  distributed.  I  request  representatives  to  use  only 
those ballot papers and to write on them the names of 
the States for which they wish to vote. 

A  ballot  will  be  declared  invalid  if  it  contains 
more names of Member States from the relevant region 
than  the  number  of  seats  assigned  to  it. A  ballot  will 
also  be  declared  invalid  if  none  of  the  names  of  the 
Member  States  on  that  ballot  belongs  to  the  relevant 
region. If a ballot paper of a region contains the names 
of  one  or  more  Member  States  that  do  not  belong  to 
that  region,  the  ballot  remains  valid,  but  only  the 
names of the Member States that belong to the relevant 
region  will  be  counted.  The  names  of  Member  States 
that do not belong to that region will not be counted at 
all. 

At  the  invitation  of  the  President,  Ms.  Francisco 
(Angola),  Mr.  Babić  (Croatia),  Ms.  Maskay 
(France),  Ms.  Del  Águila-Castillo  (Guatemala), 
Mr.  Visonnavong 
(Lao  People’s  Democratic 
Republic) and Mr. Dosseh (Togo) acted as tellers. 
A vote was taken by secret ballot. 
The  meeting  was  suspended  at  11.15  a.m.  and
