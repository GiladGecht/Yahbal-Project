A/65/PV.57 


Under  the  draft  resolution  recommended  for 
adoption,  which  is  reproduced  in  paragraph  6  of  the 
report,  the  General  Assembly  would  decide  that  the 
Sixth  Committee  should  continue  its  consideration  of 
the  matter,  without  prejudice  to  the  consideration  of 
this  topic  and  related  issues  in  other  forums  of  the 
United  Nations,  and  for  that  purpose  would  decide  to 
establish, at its sixty-sixth session, a working group of 
the  Sixth  Committee 
thorough 
discussion  of  the  scope  and  application  of  universal 
jurisdiction.  

The  Assembly  would  also  invite  Member  States 
and  relevant  observers,  as  appropriate,  to  submit 
information  and  observations  on  the  issue,  including, 
where  appropriate, 
relevant 
applicable  international  treaties,  their  domestic  legal 
rules  and  judicial  practice,  and  would  request  the 
Secretary-General  to  submit  to  the  General Assembly, 
at  its  sixty-sixth  session,  a  report  based  on  such 
information and observations.

it  is  my  hope  that  the  General Assembly  will  be  in  a 
position to do the same. 

I  shall  now  turn  to  the  heading  “Drug  control, 
crime prevention and combating international terrorism 
in all its forms and manifestations”. 

The  Sixth  Committee  considered  agenda  item 
107,  “Measures  to  eliminate  international  terrorism”, 
under this heading. The relevant report is contained in

Assembly resolution 51/210 to report to the Assembly 
during 
the 
completion  of  the  draft  comprehensive  convention  on 
international terrorism. 

The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution 
without  a  vote,  and  it  is  my  hope  that  the  Assembly 
will  be  able  to  do  the  same.  As  in  the  past,  it  is 
envisaged that the item in question will remain on the 
agenda of the General Assembly.

procedural  issues.  I  will  begin  with  the  substantive 
issues. 

The  report  on  agenda  item  140,  “Administration 
of  justice  at  the  United  Nations”,  is  contained  in 
document A/65/478.  It  reproduces,  in  paragraph  10,  a 
draft  decision  whereby  the  General  Assembly  would 
decide  that  the  consideration  of  the  outstanding  legal 
aspects of the item, including the question of effective 
remedies for non-staff personnel, as well as the code of 
conduct  for  the  judges  of  the  United  Nations  Dispute 
Tribunal  and  the  United  Nations  Appeals  Tribunal, 
should be continued during its sixty-sixth session in the 
framework of a working group of the Sixth Committee. 

The  report  on  agenda  item  161,  “Report  of  the 
Committee  on  Relations  with  the  Host  Country”,  is 
contained 
the  draft 
resolution  recommended  to  the  General Assembly  for 
adoption appears in paragraph 8 of the report. 
The two procedural items considered by the Sixth 

Committee  under  the  third  heading  are  agenda  item 
118,  “Revitalization  of  the  work  of  the  General 
Assembly”,  and  agenda 
item  130,  “Programme 
planning”. 
The report under agenda item 118, containing the 

provisional  programme  of  work  of 
the  Sixth 
Committee  during  the  sixty-sixth  session,  is  to  be 
found in document A/65/476, and the draft decision by 
which  the  General  Assembly  would  take  note  of  the 
provisional  programme  of  work  is  reproduced  in 
paragraph  7  of  the  report.  The  report  on  agenda  item 
130 is contained in document A/65/477, and no further 
action by the General Assembly is recommended. 

The  draft  decisions  and  the  draft  resolution 
relating  to  the  agenda  items  under  this  third  heading 
were  also  adopted  by  the  Sixth  Committee  without  a 
vote,  and  once  again  it  is  my  hope  that  the  General 
Assembly will be in a position to do the same. 

Finally, I wish to inform the Assembly that there 
is  no  report  in  respect  of  agenda  item  5,  “Election  of 
the officers of the Main Committees”. Consistent with 
previous  practice,  the  election  of  the  officers  of  the 
Sixth  Committee  for  the  sixty-sixth  session  will  be 
taken  up  at  a  later  stage  in  the  course  of  the  current 
session. 

This concludes my introduction of the reports of 
the  Sixth  Committee.  Let  me  take  this  opportunity  to 
express  my  gratitude  to  the  Chairperson  of  the  Sixth
