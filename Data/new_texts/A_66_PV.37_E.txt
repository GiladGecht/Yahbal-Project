Agenda item 113 
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs 
  (a)  Election of five non-permanent members of  


the Security Council 

The  President  (spoke  in  Arabic):  The  General 
Assembly  will  now  proceed  to  the  election  of  five 
non-permanent  members  of  the  Security  Council  to 
replace those members whose term of office expires on 
31 December 2011. 

The  five  outgoing  non-permanent  members  are 
the following: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Gabon, 
Lebanon  and  Nigeria.  Those  five  States  cannot  be 
re-elected.  Their  names,  therefore,  should  not  appear 
on the ballot papers. 

Apart  from  the  five  permanent  members,  the 
Security  Council  will  include  in  the  year  2012  the 
following  States:  Colombia,  Germany,  India,  Portugal 
and South Africa. The names of those States, therefore, 
should also not appear on the ballot papers. 

Of  the  five  non-permanent  members  that  will 
remain in office in the year 2012, two are from Africa 
and  Asia-Pacific,  one  is  from  Latin  America  and  the 
Caribbean and two are from Western Europe and other 
States.  Consequently,  pursuant  to  paragraph  3  of 
General  Assembly  resolution  1991  A  (XVIII),  of 
17 December  1963,  the  five  non-permanent  members 
should  be  elected  according  to  the  following  pattern: 
three  from  Africa  and  Asia-Pacific,  one  from  Eastern 

Europe and one from Latin America and the Caribbean. 
The ballot papers reflect that pattern. 

In  accordance  with  established  practice,  there  is 
an  understanding  to  the  effect  that,  of  the  three  States 
to be elected from Africa and Asia-Pacific, two should 
be from Africa and one from Asia-Pacific. 

I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  those 
candidates  —  their  number  not  exceeding  the  number 
of seats to be filled — receiving the greatest number of 
votes  and  a  two-thirds  majority  of  those  present  and 
voting,  will  be  declared  elected.  If  the  number  of 
candidates  receiving  a  two-thirds  majority  is  less  than 
the  number  of  members  to  be  elected,  there  shall  be 
additional ballots to fill the remaining seats, the voting 
being restricted to the candidates obtaining the greatest 
number of votes in the previous ballot to a number not 
more than twice the places remaining to be filled. 
Also,  consistent  with  past  practice,  in  case  a  tie 

vote  should  make  it  necessary  to  determine  the 
candidate to be elected or that will proceed to the next 
round  of  restricted  balloting,  there  will  be  a  special 
restricted  ballot  limited  to  those  candidates  that  have 
obtained an equal number of votes. 

that procedure? 
It was so decided. 


The  President  (spoke  in  Arabic):  In  accordance 
with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall 
be  held  by  secret  ballot  and  there  shall  be  no 
nominations. 
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to

Regarding candidatures, I have been informed by 
the  Chairpersons  of  the  respective  regional  groups  of 
the  following.  For  the  three  vacant  seats  from  among 
the  African  and  Asian-Pacific  States,  five  candidates 
have been designated, namely, Kyrgyzstan, Mauritania, 
Morocco,  Pakistan  and  Togo.  For  the  one  vacant  seat 
from  among  the  Eastern  European  States,  there  are 
three  candidates,  namely,  Azerbaijan,  Hungary  and 
Slovenia. For the one vacant seat from among the Latin 
American  and Caribbean  States, there is one endorsed 
candidate, namely, Guatemala. 

In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of 
procedure,  we  shall  now  proceed  to  the  election  by 
secret ballot. 

Before we begin the voting process, I should like 
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the 
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no 
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a 
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting. 

We shall now begin the voting process. Members 
are  requested  to  remain  seated  until  all  ballots  have 
been collected. Ballot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” 
will now be distributed. I request representatives to use 
only those ballot papers that have been distributed. 

May I ask representatives to write clearly on the 
ballot  papers  marked  “A”,  for  the African  and Asian-
Pacific States, the names of the three States for which 
they wish to vote; on the ballot papers marked “B”, for 
the Eastern European States, the name of the one State 
for  which  they  wish  to  vote;  and  on  the  ballot  papers 
marked  “C”,  for  the  Latin  American  and  Caribbean 
States, the name of the one State for which they wish to 
vote. 

A  ballot  will  be  declared  invalid  if  it  contains 
more names of Member States from the relevant region 
than  the  number  of  seats  assigned  to  it. A  ballot  will 
also be declared invalid if all the names of the Member 
States  on  that  ballot  do  not  belong  to  the  relevant 
region.  If  a  ballot  paper  contains  names  of  Member 
States  that  do  not  belong  to  that  region,  the  ballot 
remains  valid,  but  only  the  names  of  the  Member 
States  that  belong  to  the  relevant  region  will  be 
counted.  The  names  of  Member  States  that  do  not 
belong to that region will not be counted at all. 

At  the  invitation  of  the  President,  Mr.  Baptista 
(Angola),  Mr.  Tegos  (Greece),  Mrs.  Dockendorf 
(Luxembourg),  Mr.  Bonifaz  (Peru),  Ms.  Popovici

The  President:  There  remain  two  seats  to  be 

filled,  one  from  among  the  Group  of  African  and 
Asian-Pacific States and one from among the Group of 
Eastern European States. We shall therefore proceed to 
the first restricted ballot. 

In  accordance  with  established  practice,  there  is 
an  understanding  to  the  effect  that,  of  the  three  seats 
allocated  to  the  Group  of  African  and  Asian-Pacific 
States, two should be  filled by African  States and one 
by  an  Asian-Pacific  State.  As  Morocco  and  Pakistan 
have  already  been  elected,  the  remaining  seat  for  the 
Group  of  African  and  Asian-Pacific  States  should  be 
filled by an African State. 

The second round of balloting shall be restricted 
to  the  two  States  from  among  the African  and Asian-
Pacific  States  that  were  not  elected  but  that  obtained 
the  largest  number  of  votes  in  the  previous  ballot, 
namely,  Togo  and  Mauritania;  and  to  the  two  States 
from among the Eastern European States that were not 
elected but that obtained the largest number of votes in 
the  previous  ballot,  namely, Azerbaijan  and  Slovenia. 
That  is  in  accordance  with  rule  94  of  the  rules  of 
procedure. 

Before we begin the voting process, I should like 
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the 
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no 
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a 
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting. 
We shall now begin the voting process. 


Ballot  papers  marked  “A”  and  “B”  will  now  be 
distributed.  May  I  ask  representatives  to  write  on  the 
ballot  papers  the  names  of  the  States  for  which  they 
wish to vote. Ballot papers marked “A” for African and 
Asian-Pacific  States  will  be  declared  invalid  if  they 
contain  the  name  of  a  State  other  than  Mauritania  or 
Togo, as well as if they contain the names of more than 
one  State.  Ballot  papers  marked  “B”  for  Eastern 
European States will be declared invalid if they contain 
the name of a State other than Azerbaijan or Slovenia, 
as well as if they contain the names of more than one 
State. 

At  the  invitation  of  the  President,  Mr.  Baptista 
(Angola),  Mr.  Tegos  (Greece),  Mrs.  Dockendorf 
(Luxembourg),  Mr.  Bonifaz  (Peru),  Ms.  Popovici 
(Republic  of  Moldova)  and  Ms.  Wairatpanij

Since  no  candidate  obtained  the  required  two-
thirds majority in the previous ballot, there remain two 
seats to be filled, one from among the Group of African 
and  Asian-Pacific  States  and  one  from  among  the 
Group  of  Eastern  European  States.  We  shall  therefore 
proceed to the second restricted ballot. 

In  accordance  with  established  practice,  there  is 
an  understanding  to  the  effect  that,  of  the  three  seats 
allocated  to  the  Group  of  African  and  Asian-Pacific 
States, two should be  filled by African  States and one 
by  an  Asian-Pacific  State.  As  Morocco  and  Pakistan 
have  already  been  elected,  the  remaining  seat  for  the 
Group  of  African  and  Asian-Pacific  States  should  be 
filled by an African State. 

The third round of balloting shall be restricted to 
the  two  States  from  among  the  African  and  Asian-
Pacific  States  that  were  not  elected  but  that  obtained 
the  largest  number  of  votes  in  the  previous  ballot, 
namely,  Togo  and  Mauritania;  and  to  the  two  States 
from among the Eastern European States that were not 
elected but that obtained the largest number of votes in 
the  previous  ballot,  namely, Azerbaijan  and  Slovenia.
