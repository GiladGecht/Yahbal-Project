The  President  (spoke  in  Arabic):  As  Members 

will  recall,  at  its  37th  plenary  meeting  this  morning, 
after three rounds of balloting, including two rounds of 
restricted  balloting,  the  Assembly  elected  Guatemala, 
Morocco,  Pakistan  and  Togo  as  members  of  the 
Security  Council  for  a  two-year  term  beginning  on 
1 January 2012. 

the  Eastern  European  States.  We  shall 
proceed to the third restricted ballot.  

This  fourth  round  of  balloting  shall  be  restricted 
to  the  two  States  from  among  the  Eastern  European 
States  that  were  not  elected  but  obtained  the  largest 
number  of  votes  in  the  previous  ballot,  namely, 
Azerbaijan  and  Slovenia.  This  is  in  accordance  with 
rule 94 of the rules of procedure. 

Before we begin the voting process, I should like 
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the 
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no 
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a 
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting. 

Ballot  papers  marked  “B”  will  now  be 
distributed.  May  I  ask  representatives  to  write  on  the 


ballot papers the name of the State for which they wish 
to  vote.  Ballot  papers  marked  “B”  for  the  Eastern 
European States will be declared invalid if they contain 
the name of a State other than Azerbaijan or Slovenia, 
as  well  as  if  they  contain  the  name  of  more  than  one 
State.

(Angola),  Mr.  Tegos  (Greece),  Mrs.  Dockendorf 
(Luxembourg),  Mr.  Bonifaz  (Peru),  Ms.  Popovici

the  election  of 
The  President  (spoke 
A/66/PV.38 

Mr. Mehdiyev (Azerbaijan): I wish to inform the 

Assembly  that  I  have  asked  the  Secretariat  to  prolong 
the voting for an additional hour today. 
The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to 

inform  the  representative  of  Azerbaijan  that,  first, 
simultaneous  interpretation  services  will  end  shortly 
and that, secondly, we have received a request from the 
delegation of Slovenia to adjourn the meeting. It shall 
therefore be difficult to continue with the voting, and I 
suggest that we proceed with the plan to resume voting 
for  the  members  of  the  Security  Council  on  Monday, 
24  October  2011,  following 
the 
members of the Economic and Social Council. 
Mr.  Mehdiyev  (Azerbaijan)  (spoke  in Arabic):  I 

would  point  out  that  I  made  my  request  to  the 
Secretariat a half-hour ago. 
(spoke in English) 
I would therefore ask you, Sir, to make an exception in 
this case. 
in  Arabic):  We  find 

ourselves  confronted  with  two  conflicting  requests. 
Although the time allotted for the voting today ran out 
at  6  p.m.,  and  despite  a  request  that  we  adjourn  the 
meeting  following  the  latest  round  of  balloting,  we 
have  received  another  request  that  the  voting  be 
extended.  

A decision in this matter is undoubtedly difficult 
to  make.  Given  the  fact  that  the  time  allocated  to  this 
meeting 
simultaneous 
interpretation services will no longer be available, and 
also  given  the  importance  of  this  matter,  I  refer  this 
problem  to  the  members  of  the  General  Assembly  to 
decide the best way to proceed. 
Mr.  Araud  (France)  (spoke  in  French):  As  you 

know, Sir, it is the unwavering practice of my country’s 
delegation to refuse to proceed with our work without 
simultaneous  interpretation  services  in  all  of  the 
Organization’s official languages. 
Mr.  Churkin  (Russian  Federation)  (spoke  in 

Russian): We did not hear the proposal to continue the 
meeting  without  simultaneous  interpretation.  As  we 
understand it, interpretation services may be continued 
at the request of the President of the General Assembly. 
The  President  (spoke  in  Arabic):  Although  the 

time allocated to this meeting has elapsed, I suggest we 
elapsed 
that 
and 
has 
4 

in 
the  required 
two-thirds  majority 
continue  our  work  until  we  have  completed  a  final 
round of voting. 
It was so decided. 

The President: I repeat that, as no candidate has 

received 
the 
preceding  ballot,  there  remains  one  seat  to  be  filled 
from  among  the  Eastern  Europe  States.  We  shall 
therefore proceed to a fifth restricted ballot. This ninth 
round of balloting shall be restricted to the two States 
from among the Eastern European States that were not 
elected but obtained the largest number of votes in the 
previous ballot, namely, Azerbaijan and Slovenia. This 
is in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure. 

Before we begin the voting process, I should like 
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the 
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no 
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a 
point of order on the actual conduct of the voting. 
We shall now begin the voting process. 


Ballot  papers  marked  “B”  will  now  be 
distributed.  May  I  ask  representatives  to  write  on  the 
ballot papers the name of the State for which they wish 
to  vote.  Ballot  papers  marked  “B”  for  the  Eastern 
European States will be declared invalid if they contain 
the name of a State other than Azerbaijan or Slovenia, 
as  well  as  if  they  contain  the  name  of  more  than  one 
State. 

At  the  invitation  of  the  President,  Mr.  Baptista 
(Angola),  Mr.  Tegos  (Greece),  Mrs.  Dockendorf 
(Luxembourg),  Mr.  Bonifaz  (Peru),  Ms.  Popovici 
(Republic  of  Moldova)  and  Ms.  Wairatpanij 
(Thailand) acted as tellers. 
A vote was taken by secret ballot. 
The  meeting  was  suspended  at  6.40  p.m.  and 
resumed at 6.55 p.m.
