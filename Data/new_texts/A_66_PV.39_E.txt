Agenda item 113 (continued)
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs 
  (b)  Election of eighteen members of the Economic 






and Social Council 
  Letter dated 30 September 2011 from the 
Permanent Representative of Monaco to the 
United Nations addressed to the President of 
the General Assembly (A/66/495) 
  Letter dated 5 October 2011 from the 
Permanent Representative of the Russian 
Federation to the United Nations addressed to 
the President of the General Assembly (A/66/496) 
The  President  (spoke  in Arabic): The Assembly 

will first proceed to a by-election to elect members of 
the  Economic  and  Social  Council,  in  accordance  with 
rule 140 of the rules of procedure. 

In that connection, I would first like to draw the 
attention  of  members  to  documents  A/66/495  and 
A/66/496,  which  contain  letters  dated  30  September 
and 
the  Permanent 
Representatives of Monaco and the Russian Federation 
to the United Nations, respectively.  

In  her  letter,  the  Permanent  Representative  of 
Monaco  announces,  in  her  capacity  as  Chair  of  the 
Group  of  Western  European  and  other  States,  that 
Belgium  will  relinquish  its  seat  on  the  Economic  and 
Social Council at the end of 2011 for the remainder of 
5  October 
2011 
from 
its term in favour of the Netherlands, and that Norway 
will  relinquish  its  seat  on  the  Council  at  the  end  of 
2011  for  the  remainder  of  its  term  in  favour  of 
Switzerland.  

In his letter, the Permanent Representative of the 
Russian Federation announces, in his capacity as Chair 
of the Group of Eastern European States, that Hungary 
will  relinquish  its  seat  on  the  Economic  and  Social 
Council at the end of 2011 for the remainder of its term 
in favour of Bulgaria.  

As  a  result,  three  vacancies  will  occur  and  new 
members must therefore be elected to fill the unexpired 
terms  of  office  of  Belgium,  Hungary  and  Norway, 
commencing  on  1  January  2012  and  expiring  on 
31 December  2012,  in  the  case  of  Belgium,  and 
31 December  2013  in  the  cases  of  Hungary  and 
Norway. 

In  accordance  with  paragraph  4  of  resolution 
2847  (XXVI),  of  20  December  1971,  and  taking  into 
account  that  the  vacancies  will  occur  from  among  the 
Group  of  Eastern  European  States  and  the  Group  of 
Western  European  and  other  States,  the  new  members 
should therefore be elected from those regions. 

I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  the 
candidates  who  receive  the  greatest  number  of  votes 
and  a  two-thirds  majority  of  the  votes  by  members 
present and voting will be declared elected. May I take 
it that the General Assembly agrees to that procedure? 

It was so decided.

The  President  (spoke  in  Arabic):  In  accordance 

with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of  procedure  of  the  General 
Assembly,  the  election  shall  be  held  by  secret  ballot 
and  there  shall  be  no  nominations.  We  shall  now 
proceed accordingly. 

I  should  like  to  inform  members  that,  as  of 
1 January 2012, the following States from the Group of 
Eastern  European  States  and  the  Group  of  Western 
European  and  other  States  will  be  represented  on  the 
Economic  and  Social  Council:  Australia,  Canada, 
Finland, 
the  Russian  Federation, 
Slovakia,  Ukraine,  the  United  Kingdom  of  Great 
Britain  and  Northern  Ireland  and  the  United  States  of 
America.  The  names  of 
those  10  States  should 
therefore not appear on the ballot. 

Before we begin the voting process, I should like 
to  remind  members  that,  pursuant  to  rule  88  of  the 
rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no 
representative  shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a 
point  of  order  on  the  actual  conduct  of  the  voting.  In 
addition,  ballot  papers  will  only  be  distributed  to  the 
representatives  seated  directly  behind  the  country’s 
nameplate. 

We shall now begin the voting process. Members 
are  requested  to  remain  seated  until  all  ballots  have 
been collected. 
Allow  me  to  remind  members  that  they  are  now 

voting in the by-election for one seat for the Group of 
Eastern European States and two seats for the Group of 
Western  European  and  other  States.  The  election  of 
18 members of the Council will take place immediately 
following this by-election. 

Ballot papers marked with the letters A and B will 
now  be  distributed.  I  request  representatives  to  use 
only  those  ballot  papers  and  to  write  on  them  the 
names  of  the  States  for  which  they  wish  to  vote.  A 
ballot  will  be  declared  invalid  if  it  contains  more 
names of Member States from the relevant region than 
the number of seats assigned to it. A ballot will also be 
declared invalid if all the names of the Member States 
on that ballot do not belong to the relevant region. 

At  the  invitation  of  the  President,  Ms.  Apeyitou 
(Cyprus),  Ms.  Reyes  (Honduras),  Mr.  Macchia 
(Italy),  Ms.  Mwaura  (Kenya),  Ms.  Šćepanović
(Montenegro)  and  Mrs.  Sulimani  (Sierra  Leone) 
acted as tellers. 
A vote was taken by secret ballot.

The  18  outgoing  members  are:  Côte  d’Ivoire,

India,  Japan,  Malta,  Mauritius,  Morocco,  Namibia, 
Peru,  Saint  Kitts  and  Nevis,  Saudi  Arabia,  Spain,

countries are eligible for immediate re-election. 
Members  will  recall  that  Belgium,  Hungary  and 

the  Council, 
Norway  relinquished

Netherlands and Switzerland have just been elected to 
fill those vacancies. 
the 

following  States  will  be  represented  on  the  Economic 
and Social Council: Argentina, Australia, the Bahamas, 
Bangladesh,  Bulgaria,  Cameroon,  Canada,  Chile, 
China,  the  Comoros,  Ecuador,  Egypt,  Finland,  Gabon, 
Ghana, Iraq, Italy, Latvia, Malawi, Mexico, Mongolia, 
the  Netherlands,  Nicaragua,  Pakistan,  the  Philippines, 
Qatar,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  the  Russian  Federation, 
Rwanda,  Senegal,  Slovakia,  Switzerland,  Ukraine,  the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 
the  United  States  of America  and  Zambia. The  names 
of  those  36  States  should  therefore  not  appear  on  the 
ballots. 

In  accordance  with  paragraph  4  of  resolution 
2847  (XXVI),  of  20  December  1971,  and  taking  into 
account the number of States that will remain members 
of  the  Council  after  1  January  2012,  the  18  members 
should be elected as follows: five from African States, 
three  from Asian  and  Pacific  States,  one  from  Eastern 
European  States,  four  from  Latin  American  and 
Caribbean States and five from Western European and 
other States. The ballot papers reflect that pattern. 

I should like to inform the General Assembly that 
those  candidates  —  their  number  not  exceeding  the 
number of seats to be filled — that receive a two-thirds 
majority and the greatest number of votes by members 
present and voting, will be declared elected. Consistent 
with  past  practice,  in  the  case  of  a  tie  vote  for  a 
remaining seat, there will be a special restricted ballot 
limited  to  those  candidates  that  obtained  an  equal 
number of votes.

It was so decided. 

The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the 

rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret 
ballot and there shall be no nominations. 

With  regard  to  candidatures  of  the  respective 
regional  groups,  the  Secretariat  has  been  informed  of 
the following. For the five vacant seats from among the 
African States, the Group has endorsed five candidates: 
Burkina  Faso,  Ethiopia,  Lesotho,  Libya  and  Nigeria. 
For  the  three  vacant  seats  from  among  the Asian  and 
Pacific  States, 
three 
candidates:  India,  Indonesia  and  Japan.  For  the  one 
vacant  seat  from  among  the  Eastern  European  States, 
the  Group  has  endorsed  Belarus.  For  the  four  vacant 
seats  from  among  the  Latin  American  and  Caribbean 
States, the Group has endorsed four candidates: Brazil, 
Cuba,  the  Dominican  Republic  and  El  Salvador.  For 
the five vacant seats from among the Western European 
and  other  States, 
the  Group  has  endorsed  five 
candidates:  France,  Germany,  Ireland,  Spain  and 
Turkey. 

In  accordance  with  rule  92  of  the  rules  of 
procedure,  we  shall  now  proceed  to  the  election  by 
secret ballot. 

We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Ballot 
papers  marked  A,  B,  C,  D  and  E  will  now  be 
distributed.  I  request  representatives  to  use  only  those 
ballot  papers  and  to  write  on  them  the  names  of  the 
States for which they wish to vote. 

A  ballot  will  be  declared  invalid  if  it  contains 
more names of Member States from the relevant region 
than  the  number  of  seats  assigned  to  it. A  ballot  will 
also  be  declared  invalid  if  none  of  the  names  of  the 
Member  States  on  that  ballot  belongs  to  the  relevant 
region. If a ballot paper of a region contains names of 
Member  States  that  do  not  belong  to  that  region,  the 
ballot remains valid, but only the names of the Member 
States  that  belong  to  the  relevant  region  will  be 
counted.  The  names  of  Member  States  that  do  not 
belong to that region will not be counted at all. 

At  the  invitation  of  the  President,  Ms.  Apeyitou 
(Cyprus),  Ms.  Reyes  (Honduras),  Mr.  Macchia 
(Italy),  Ms.  Mwaura  (Kenya),  Ms.  Šćepanović

of agenda item 113. 
This concludes our consideration of sub-item (b) 
three-year 
for  a 



  (a)  Election of five non-permanent members of the 
Security Council 
The  President  (spoke  in  Arabic):  As  members 

will recall, at its 37th and 38th plenary meetings, held 
on  21  October,  following  nine  rounds  of  balloting, 
including  five  rounds  of  restricted  balloting  and  three 
rounds of unrestricted balloting, the General Assembly 
elected  Guatemala,  Morocco,  Pakistan  and  Togo  as 
members  of  the  Security  Council  for  a  two-year  term 
of office beginning on 1 January 2012. 

There  remains  one  seat  to  be  filled  from  among 
the  Group  of  Eastern  European  States.  We  shall 
therefore  proceed  to  the  sixth  restricted  ballot.  In 
accordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure, this 
11-56028 


tenth  round  of  balloting  shall  be  restricted  to  the  two 
States  from  among  the  Eastern  European  States  that 
were  not  elected  but  obtained  the  largest  number  of 
votes  in  the  previous  ballot,  namely,  Azerbaijan  and 
Slovenia. 

We  will  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Ballot 
papers  marked  B  will  now  be  distributed.  May  I  ask 
representatives  to  write  on  the  ballot  papers  the  name 
of the State for which they wish to vote. Ballot papers 
marked  B,  for  the  Eastern  European  States,  will  be 
declared  invalid  if  they  contain  the  name  of  a  State 
other  than  Azerbaijan  or  Slovenia,  as  well  as  if  they 
contain the name of more than one State. 

At  the  invitation  of  the  President,  Mr.  Baptista 
(Angola),  Mr.  Tegos  (Greece),  Mrs.  Dockendorf 
(Luxembourg),  Ms.  Popovici
