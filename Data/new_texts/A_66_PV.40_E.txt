As  no  candidate  has  received  the  required  two-

States.  We  shall 
to  a  seventh 
unrestricted ballot. This seventeenth round of balloting 
is in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure. 
I give the floor the representative of Slovenia. 

Mr. Žbogar (Slovenia): We entered this race for 

a  Security  Council  seat  11  years  ago,  and  we  believe 
that we are a good candidate and a good fit for today’s 
Council.  Our  campaign  was  always  for  Slovenia  and 
the  values  we  represent.  We  were  never  campaigning 
against any other candidate.  

We do not approve of the way this campaign was 
run, and we do not approve of the way these elections 
were held. However, the current result speaks for itself 
and  the  object  of  this  body’s  support  is  obvious.  I  am 
therefore withdrawing our candidature. I want to thank 
all the countries that stayed with us for supporting us. 
The President: Taking into account the statement 

made  by  the  representative  of  Slovenia,  we  shall  now 
proceed  to  the  next  unrestricted  ballot,  in  accordance 
with rule 94 of the rules of procedure. 
We shall now begin the voting process. 


Ballot  papers  marked  “B”  will  now  be
