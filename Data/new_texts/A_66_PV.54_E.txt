I  should  like  to  remind  representatives  that, 
A/66/PV.54 


Since  no  candidate  has  obtained  an  absolute 
majority  in  the  previous  round  of  balloting,  the 
Assembly will proceed to another unrestricted ballot to 
fill the remaining vacancy.  

pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure,  

“After  the  President  has  announced  the 

beginning  of  voting,  no  representative  shall 
interrupt the voting except on a point of order in 
connection with the actual conduct of the voting.” 
Any  announcements, 
those  concerning 
withdrawals of candidatures, should therefore be made 
prior to the commencement of the voting process, that 
is to say, before the announcement of the beginning of 
the voting process. 
Mr.  Raytchev  (Bulgaria):  On  behalf  of  the 

delegation  of  Bulgaria,  I  would  like  to  announce  that 
our  nominated  candidate,  Ms.  Tsvetana  Kamenova, 
withdraws her candidature for the position.  

I  would  also  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to 
congratulate  all  those  who  have  been  elected  and  to 
wish  them  every  success  in  their  future  endeavours.  I 
also  wish  every  success  to  those  who  remain  in  the 
election process.  
Mr. Diallo (Senegal)  (spoke in French): I would 

like  to  thank  my  Bulgarian  colleague  for  his  spirit  of 
cooperation. We are great friends.  

I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  say  that 
the  delegation  of  Senegal,  having  consulted  with 
candidate  Mr.  El  Hadji  Mansour  Tall,  would  like  to 
withdraw  his  candidature.  I  also  take  this  opportunity 
to  thank  all  the  countries  who  voted  for  Mr.  Tall.  We 
also congratulate those who have already been elected, 
and wish good luck to the remaining candidates.  
The Acting President: Given the statements that 

we  have  just  heard,  may  I  take  it  that  the  national 
groups that have nominated the candidates of Bulgaria 
and Senegal concur with their withdrawal? 
It was so decided. 

The  Acting  President:  They  are  therefore  no 

longer candidates and their names have therefore been 
deleted from the ballot papers.

All  the  candidates  whose  names  appear  on  the 
ballot  paper  are  eligible.  The  names  of  the  two 
candidates  who  have  withdrawn  their  candidatures 
have  been  deleted  from  the  ballots.  May  I  remind 
delegations that the name of only one candidate should 
be  marked  with  a  cross.  Any  ballot  paper  on  which 
more  than  one  name  is  marked  will  be  considered 
invalid. Votes may be cast only for those whose names 
appear on the ballot papers.
