Since  no  candidate  has  obtained  an  absolute 
majority  in  the  previous  round  of  balloting,  the 
Assembly will proceed to another unrestricted ballot to 
fill the remaining vacancy.  

pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure,  

“After  the  President  has  announced  the 

beginning  of  voting,  no  representative  shall 
interrupt the voting except on a point of order in 
connection with the actual conduct of the voting.” 
Any  announcements, 
those  concerning 
withdrawals of candidatures, should therefore be made 
prior to the commencement of the voting process, that 
is to say, before the announcement of the beginning of 
the voting process. 

papers will now be distributed. 
All  the  candidates  whose  names  appear  on  the 

ballot  paper  are  eligible.  The  names  of  the  two 
candidates  who  have  withdrawn  their  candidatures 
have  been  deleted  from  the  ballots.  May  I  remind 
delegations that the name of only one candidate should

more  than  one  name  is  marked  will  be  considered 
invalid. Votes may be cast only for those whose names

the President of the Security Council.  

Security Council, which reads: 

the  General  Assembly  and 
“I have the honour to inform you that at the 

6653rd  meeting  of  the  Security  Council,  held  on 
10  November  2011,  for  the  purpose  of  electing 
five members of the International Court of Justice 
for  a  term  of  office  beginning  on  6  February 
2012, Mr. Abdul G. Koroma obtained an absolute 
majority of votes.” 
As  a  result  of  the  voting  that  has  taken  place 

the 
independently 
Security  Council,  no  candidate  has  obtained  an 
absolute majority in both bodies.  

In accordance with Article 12 of the Statute of the 
International  Court  of  Justice,  if,  after  the  third 
meeting, one or more seats still remain unfilled, a joint 
conference consisting of six members, three appointed 
by  the  General  Assembly  and  three  by  the  Security 
Council,  may  be  formed  at  any  time  at  the  request  of 
either  the  General  Assembly  or  the  Security  Council 
for  the  purpose  of  choosing  by  vote  an  absolute 
majority one name for each seat still vacant, to submit 
to  the  General Assembly  and  the  Security  Council  for 
their respective acceptance. The General Assembly has 
never  chosen  to  avail  itself  of  a  joint  conference  and 
has,  in  similar  circumstances,  proceeding  to  conduct 
further balloting.  

I  therefore  intend,  unless  and  until  the  General 
Assembly  decides  otherwise,  to  follow  past  practice 
and  to  continue  with  balloting  in  accordance  with 
applicable  procedures.  Unless  I  hear  any  objection,  I 
shall  take  it  that  the  Assembly  agrees  to  proceed 
accordingly. 




It was so decided. 
  The meeting rose at 4.55 p.m.
