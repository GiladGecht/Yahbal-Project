Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs
(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic 
and Social Council
Letter dated 28 September 2012 from the 
Permanent Representative of Australia to the 
United Nations to the Secretariat (A/67/485)
The  Acting  President:  The  Assembly  will 
now  proceed  to  by-elections  to  elect  members  of  the 
Economic and Social Council, in accordance with rule 
140 of the rules of procedure.
In  that  connection,  I  would  first  like  to  draw  the 
attention  of  members  to  document  A/67/485,  which 
contains  a  letter  dated  28  September  2012  from  the 
Permanent  Representative  of  Australia  to  the  United 
Nations.  In  his  letter,  the  Permanent  Representative 
of  Australia,  in  his  capacity  as  Chair  of  the  Western 
European  and  other  States,  announces  that  Australia 
will  relinquish  its  seat  on  the  Economic  and  Social 
Council  at  the  end  of  the  year  2012  for  the  remainder 
of  its  term  in  favour  of  New  Zealand;  that  Germany 
will  relinquish  its  seat  on  the  Council,  also  at  the  end 
of the year 2012, for the remainder of its term in favour 
of  Austria;  that  Finland  will  relinquish  its  seat  on 
the  Council,  also  at  the  end  of  the  year  2012,  for  the 
remainder  of  its  term  in  favour  of  Denmark;  and  that 
Switzerland will relinquish its seat on the Council, also 
at the end of the year 2012, for the remainder of its term 
in favour of Sweden.
As  a  result,  four  vacancies  will  occur  and  new 
members must therefore be elected to fill the unexpired 
terms  of  office  of  Australia,  Germany,  Finland  and 
Switzerland,  commencing  on  1  January  2013  and 
expiring on 31 December 2013 in the case of Australia, 
Finland and Switzerland, and on 31 December 2014 in 
the case of Germany.
In accordance with paragraph 4 of resolution 2847 
(XXVI) of 20 December 1971, and taking into account 
that the vacancies will occur from among the Group of 
Western  European  and  other  States,  the  new  members 
should therefore be elected from that region.
I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  the 
candidates  who  receive  a  two-thirds  majority  and  the 
greatest  number  of  votes  by  members  present  and 
voting  will  be  declared  elected.  May  I  take  it  that  the 
General Assembly agrees to that procedure?
It was so decided.
The  Acting  President:  In  accordance  with  rule 
92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall be held 
by secret ballot and there shall be no nominations. We 
shall now proceed accordingly.
I should like to inform members that, as of 1 January 
2013,  the  following  States  from  the  Group  of  Western 
European  and  other  States  will  be  represented  on  the 
Economic  and  Social  Council:  France,  Ireland,  Spain,

Turkey  and  the  United  Kingdom  of  Great  Britain  and 
Northern Ireland. The names of those five States should 
therefore not appear on the ballot.
Before we begin the voting process, I should like to 
remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of 
procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  no  representative 
shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a  point  of  order 
on the actual conduct of the voting. In addition, ballot 
papers  will  be  given  only  to  the  representative  seated 
directly behind the country’s nameplate.
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Members 
are  requested  to  remain  seated  until  all  ballots  have 
been collected.
I should like to remind members that, at this stage, 
they  are  voting  in  the  by-election  for  four  seats  for 
the  Group  of  Western  European  and  other  States.  The 
election  of  18  members  of  the  Council  will  take  place 
immediately following this by-election.
Ballot  papers  will  now  be  distributed.  I  request 
representatives  to  use  only  those  ballot  papers  and 
to  write  on  them  the  names  of  the  States  for  which 
they  wish  to  vote.  A  ballot  will  be  declared  invalid 
if  it  contains  more  names  of  Member  States  from  the 
relevant region than the number of seats assigned to it. 
A  ballot  will  also  be  declared  invalid  if  all  the  names 
of the Member States on that ballot do not belong to the 
relevant region.

Having obtained the required two-thirds majority, 
Austria,  Denmark,  New  Zealand  and  Sweden 
were elected members of the Economic and Social 
Council for a term of office beginning on 1 January 
2013 and ending on 31 December 2013 in the case 
of  Denmark,  New  Zealand  and  Sweden,  and  on 
31 December 2014 in the case of Austria.
The  Acting  President:  I  congratulate  Austria, 
Denmark,  New  Zealand  and  Sweden  on  having  been 
elected members of the Economic and Social Council.
The General Assembly will next turn to the election 
of 18 members of the Economic and Social Council to 
replace those members whose term of office expires on 
31 December 2012. 
The  18  outgoing  members  are  Argentina,  the 
Bahamas,  Bangladesh,  Canada,  Chile,  Comoros, 
Egypt,  Ghana,  Iraq,  Italy,  Mongolia,  the  Netherlands, 
the Philippines, Rwanda, Slovakia, Ukraine, the United 
States of America and Zambia. Pursuant to rule 146 of 
the  rules  of procedure,  those  countries  are  eligible  for 
immediate re-election.
Members  will  recall 
that  Australia,  Finland, 
Germany  and  Switzerland  relinquished  their  seats  on 
the  Economic  and  Social  Council,  effective  1  January 
2013,  and  that  Austria,  Denmark,  New  Zealand  and 
Sweden have just been elected to fill those vacancies.
As  of  1  January  2013,  the  following  States  will 
be  represented  on  the  Economic  and  Social  Council: 
Austria,  Belarus,  Brazil,  Bulgaria,  Burkina  Faso, 
Cameroon,  China,  Cuba,  Denmark,  the  Dominican

Korea, the Russian Federation, Senegal, Spain, Sweden, 
Turkey  and  the  United  Kingdom  of  Great  Britain  and 
Northern Ireland. The names of those 36 States should 
therefore not appear on the ballots.

In accordance with paragraph 4 of resolution 2847 
(XXVI), of 20 December 1971, and taking into account 
the  number  of  States  that  will  remain  members  of  the 
Council  after  1  January  2013,  the  eighteen  members 
should be elected as follows: five from African States, 
four  from  Asian  and  Pacific  States,  two  from  Eastern 
European  States,  three  from  Latin  American  and 
Caribbean States, and four from Western European and 
other States. The ballot papers ref lect that pattern.
I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  those 
candidates  —  their  number  not  exceeding  the  number 
of  seats  to  be  filled  —  that  receive  a  two-thirds 
majority and the greatest number of votes by members 
present and voting, will be declared elected. Consistent 
with  past  practice,  in  the  case  of  a  tie  vote  making  it 
necessary to determine the candidate that will proceed 
to the next round of restricted balloting, there will be a 
special restricted ballot limited to those candidates that 
have obtained an equal number of votes.

be  distributed.  I  request  representatives  to  use  only 
those ballot papers and to write on them the names of 
the States for which they wish to vote. A ballot will be 
declared  invalid  if  it  contains  more  names  of  Member 
States from the relevant region than the number of seats 
assigned to it. A ballot will also be declared invalid if 
none of the names of the Member States on that ballot 
belongs  to  the  relevant  region.  If  a  ballot  paper  of  a 
region contains both the names of Member States that 
belong to and that are outside of that region, the ballot 
remains valid but only the names of the Member States 
that belong to the relevant region will be counted. The 
names  of  Member  States  that  do  not  belong  to  that 
region will not be counted.
