In  the  absence  of  the  President,  Mr.  Charles 
(Trinidad  and  Tobago),  Vice-President,  took  the 
Chair. 
The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. 
Reports of the First Committee 
The  Acting  President:  The  General  Assembly 
will now take up the reports of the First Committee on 
agenda items 86 to 102, 116 and 131. 
I  now  request  Mr.  Knut  Langeland  of  Norway, 
Rapporteur  of  the  First  Committee,  to  introduce  the 
reports of the First Committee in one intervention. 
Mr. Langeland (Norway), Rapporteur of the First 
Committee:  It  gives  me  great  pleasure  to  introduce to 
the General Assembly the reports of the First Committee 
on  agenda  items  86  to  102,  116  and  131.  The  reports 
are  contained  in  documents  in  documents  A/67/401 
through A/67/419. 
In response to the General Assembly’s appeal, the 
First  Committee  continued  to  fully  utilize  its  existing 
resources  and  was  able  to  conclude  its  work  at  the 
current session in four weeks, in full accordance with 
the planned completion date, with 22 formal meetings. 
The  work  of  the  Committee  at  the  present  session 
could  be  characterized  as  very  efficient,  procedurally 
smooth  and  substantively  constructive,  especially 
in  the  light  of  the  ongoing  efforts  of  the  Secretary-
General and Member States to re-energize the process 
of disarmament in multilateral forums. 
As  the  Assembly  knows,  the  work  of  the  First 
Committee, as well as that of the other Main Committees, 
was  negatively  affected  by  Hurricane  Sandy,  which 
severely limited the time available to delegations during 
the second stage of the Committee’s work, that is, the 
thematic  debate.  Despite  those  difficulties  and  owing 
to the great leadership of the Chair, Ambassador Desra 
Percaya of Indonesia, and to the full cooperation of all 
delegates,  the  Committee  was  successful  in  finishing 
its  work  on  time.  It  is  worth  noting  that  in  that  time 
of  distress,  on  the  initiative  of  the  Chair,  the  First 
Committee  arrived  collectively  at  the  so-called  Sandy 
formula,  whereby  delegations  took  the  floor  for  short 
interventions,  while  their  full  statements  were  placed 
on the First Committee web portal. The application of 
that formula contributed to the spirit of congeniality and 
enabled the Committee to complete its work as planned.
The  First  Committee  had  before  it  53  draft 
resolutions and six decisions under various disarmament 
and  related  international  security  agenda  items  for 
its  consideration.  Of  59  adopted  draft  resolutions  and 
decisions,  34,  or  57  per  cent,  were  adopted  without  a 
vote. This year the nuclear issues were again at centre 
stage of the general debate in the First Committee. Of 
59  adopted  draft  resolutions  and  decisions,  21  were 
on  nuclear  issues  and  four  on  other  weapons  of  mass 
destruction. The draft resolutions on The Hague Code 
of  Conduct  against  Ballistic  Missile  Proliferation,  the 
Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty and the fissile material 
cut-off treaty were adopted with overwhelming support 
from Member States.
This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of 
speeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original 
languages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature 
of a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room 
U-506. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.

Visible  progress  in  the  area  of  weapons  of  mass 
destruction  in  general  and  on  nuclear  weapons  in 
particular  did  not  obscure  the  importance  of  such 
vital  disarmament  and  international  security  issues 
as  small  arms  and  light  weapons,  the  universalization 
of  existing  legal  instruments  or  on  the  role  assigned 
to  multilateralism  in  disarmament.  On  the  contrary, 
draft resolutions on various aspects of small arms and 
light weapons enjoyed increased support from Member 
States. 
The  overwhelming  majority  of  delegations 
expressed  their  deep  concern  at  the  failure  of  the 
international community to adopt the arms trade treaty 
in  July  2012.  On  the  other  hand,  the  success  of  the 
second  Review  Conference  on  the  Small  Arms  and 
Light  Weapons  Programme  of  Action  gave  us  hope 
that  the  good  momentum  in  the  area  of  conventional 
weapons could contribute in the future to consensus on 
that important aspect of disarmament.
The  overall  tone  and  results-oriented  approach 
were  clearly  evident  during  the  thematic  discussion 
stage. Panel discussions and interactive dialogues, with 
the  participation  of  the  high-level  officials  of  major 
international  disarmament  bodies  —  the  International 
Atomic  Energy  Agency,  the  Preparatory  Commission 
for 
the  Comprehensive  Nuclear-Test-Ban-Treaty 
Organization,  the  Organization  for  the  Prohibition  of 
Chemical  Weapons,  the  Conference  on  Disarmament, 
the  Disarmament  Commission  and  others  —  explored 
the  conceptual  as  well  as  the  practical  aspects  of 
national and international security.
Another  contributing  factor  was  the  sustained 
support of civil society for greater progress on a wide 
range of disarmament issues. Although the Committee 
was unable to hear statements from the representatives of 
civil society due to Hurricane Sandy, their contribution 
to disarmament was hailed by many delegations. Many 
side events were appreciated, and the daily documents 
produced by Reaching Critical Will were widely read.
The First Committee was assigned 20 agenda items 
for the current session. In the course of the general debate, 
more than one hundred delegations, including observers 
and  representatives  of  international  organizations, 
made statements. Among those, seven spoke on behalf 
of  various  groups.  About  150  short  statements  were 
made  within  the  framework  of  thematic  discussions, 
based  on  the  Sandy  formula.  Both  those  numbers  are 
unprecedented. The large number of statements in the 
thematic discussions again demonstrated the relevance 
of the Committee as an annual venue for deliberations. 
Many  speakers  who  spoke  in  the  general  and 
thematic debates expressed concern with respect to the 
continuing impasse at the Conference on Disarmament. 
By adopting a number of decisions and resolutions, the 
Committee was able to point to possible ways out of the 
current deadlock.
To  conclude,  I  would  like  to  pay  a  well-deserved 
tribute  to  all  delegations  for  their  active  participation 
in  the  work  of  the  Committee  and  their  spirit  of 
cooperation  in  the  common  search  for  a  better,  safer 
and more stable world. I should like to express special 
gratitude to the Chair of the First Committee, Mr. Desra 
Percaya  of  Indonesia,  who,  with  his  vast  experience 
in  disarmament  and  international  security  matters, 
skilfully  led  the  proceedings  of  the  Committee  with 
vision and great leadership.
Let  me  also,  on  behalf  of  the  Committee  and 
my  own  behalf,  extend  our  sincere  gratitude  to  the 
Committee’s  Vice-Chairs,  Mr.  Salim  Mohamed  Salim 
of  Kenya,  Mr.  Dovydas  Špokauskas  of  Lithuania 
and  Mr.  Alexis  Aquino  of  Peru,  for  their  valuable 
contribution  to  its  work.  I  also  wish  to  express  my 
appreciation to Ms. Angela Kane, High Representative 
for  Disarmament  Affairs,  and  to  Mr.  Jean-Jacques 
Graisse,  Acting  Head  of  the  Department  for  General 
Assembly  and  Conference  Management,  for  their 
leadership and contribution, as well as to the Secretariat 
staff that assisted the Committee.
Finally, special thanks go to the Secretary of the First 
Committee, Mr. Sergei Cherniavsky, whose invaluable 
institutional  experience  and  encyclopedic  knowledge 
of disarmament issues made a significant contribution 
to  the  successful  outcome  of  the  Committee’s  work. 
Since  it  was  the  Committee’s  last  session  before  his 
retirement, I would like to wish him success in all his 
future endeavours. On a very personal note, I can say I 
have been around in the First Committee for many, many 
years, and I would like to thank Sergei Cherniavsky for 
always being forthcoming and service-minded, giving 
us  good  advice.  It  has  been  a  great  pleasure  to  work 
with him through all these years, and I really appreciate 
his contribution to the First Committee. I wish him all 
the best for the future.
I should also like to express my gratitude to Ms. Sonia 
Elliott,  to  Ms.  Jullyette  Ukabiala  and  to  Mr.  Ioan 
Tudor,  Special  Assistant  to  the  High  Representative 
2 
12-62440
for  Disarmament  Affairs,  as  well  as  to  other  officers 
of  the  Secretariat  for  their  valuable  assistance  to  the 
Committee.  Again  speaking  personally,  I  highly 
appreciated their contributions and their hard work.
With  those  remarks,  I  present  the  reports  of  the 
First Committee, as contained in documents A/67/401 
through  A/67/419,  to  the  General  Assembly  for  its 
consideration and adoption.
The  Acting  President:  I  thank  the  Rapporteur  of 
the First Committee.
If  there  is  no  proposal  under  rule  66  of  the  rules 
of procedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly 
decides not to discuss the reports of the First Committee 
which are before the Assembly today.
It was so decided.
The  Acting  President:  Statements  will  therefore 
be  limited  to  explanations  of  vote.  The  positions  of 
delegations regarding the recommendations of the First 
Committee have been made clear in the Committee and 
are reflected in the relevant official records.

“a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its 
vote only once, that is, either in the Committee or 
in  plenary  meeting,  unless  that  delegation’s  vote 
in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the 
Committee”,
and that explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes 
and should be made by delegations from their seats.

Before  we  begin 
the 
recommendations contained in the reports of the First 
Committee, I should like to advise representatives that 
we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same 
manner as was done in the Committee, unless notified 
otherwise in advance. That means that where separate 
or  recorded  votes  were  taken,  we  will  do  the  same.  I 
also hope that we may proceed to adopt without a vote 
those  recommendations  that  were  adopted  without  a 
vote in the First Committee. 
Before  proceeding  further,  I  would  like  to  draw 
the  attention  of  members  to  a  note  by  the  Secretariat,

Agenda item 90
Establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the 
region of the Middle East
Report of the First Committee (A/67/405)
The Acting President: The Assembly has before it 
a draft resolution recommended by the First Committee 
in  paragraph  7  of  its  report.  We  will  now  take  action 
on the draft resolution. The First Committee adopted it 
without a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes 
to do the same? 
The draft resolution was adopted (resolution 67/28).
The  Acting  President:  I  give  the  floor  to  the 
representative  of  Israel  in  explanation  of  vote  on  the 
resolution just adopted.
Mr. Yanouka (Israel): Israel once again joined the 
consensus on the resolution entitled “Establishment of 
a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region of the Middle 
East”,  resolution  67/28,  notwithstanding  our  ongoing 
substantive  reservations  regarding  certain  elements 
contained  in  it.  They  include  the  reference  to  the 
non-consensual  resolution  of  the  General  Conference 
of  the  International  Atomic  Energy  Agency  (IAEA) 
entitled “Applications of IAEA safeguards in the Middle 
East”. We did so because Israel remains committed to a 
vision of the Middle East developing eventually into a 
zone free of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, 
as well as of ballistic missiles. 
Nonetheless,  Israel  has  always  maintained  that 
the issue at hand, like all other such regional security-
related issues, can be realistically addressed only within 
the  regional  context.  Israel’s  perspective  and  policy 
in  the  field  of  regional  security  and  arms  control  has 
always  been  a  pragmatic  and  realistic  approach.  It  is 
rooted in its belief that all security concerns of regional 
members  should  be  taken  into  account  and  addressed 
within the regional context. 
in 
The  disturbing  realities 
the  Middle  East 
mandate  a  practical,  step-by-step  approach,  bearing 
in  mind  the  goal  of  achieving  peaceful  resolutions 
and  reconciliation  among  all  the  States  of  the  region. 
That  process  is  inherently  an  incremental  one.  It  can 
realistically  begin  only  with  modest  arrangements  for 
confidence- and security-building measures in order to 
build  the  stable  infrastructure  and  the  necessary  trust 
for more ambitious cooperative security undertakings.
At  present,  no  regional  dialogue  exists  in  the 
Middle East, nor is there a forum in which to develop 
confidence-building measures and defuse tensions. The 
countries  of  the  Middle  East  have  no  regional  forum 
in  which  they  can  directly  communicate  with  each 
other and have dialogue on core issues that affect their 
security. At the beginning of the 1990s, the arms control 
and regional security talks were the appropriate forum 
to promote confidence and address security issues and 
challenges  in  the  area.  Such  a  mechanism  is  lacking 
4 
12-62440
today  in  that  there  is  no  channel  for  direct  discussion 
between the States in the Middle East. 
No  majority  vote  or  one-sided  resolution 
in 
international  forums  can  be  a  substitute  for  a  broad 
regional dialogue and cooperation. Our vision of what 
we can do in the space between aspiration and reality 
begins  with  the  need  to  establish  confidence-building 
measures and genuine efforts to reduce tensions in the 
area with our neighbours through greater dialogue.
The region of the Middle East is undergoing historic 
and  signiﬁ cant  transformational  changes.  The  current 
turmoil in the Arab world gives a clear example of how 
fragile and unstable the region is today. Unfortunately, 
Israel does not enjoy peace with the region as a whole, 
and  at  times  we  feel  that  our  existence  and  survival 
are  put  into  question.  Countries  in  the  area,  like  Iran, 
that  threaten  to  wipe  Israel  off  the  map  and  terrorist 
organizations,  like  Hamas  and  Hizbullah,  that  do  not 
accept  Israel’s  right  to  exist  and  continuously  engage 
in  the  massive  acquisition  of  rockets  and  missiles 
still  pose  fundamental  security  threats.  Any  regional 
security  dialogue  has  to  focus  on  actual  threats,  like 
rockets  and  missiles,  which  are  a  vital  component  of 
any regional disarmament. 
Despite  the  current  situation,  Israel  positively 
engaged,  in  July  2011,  in  the  European  Union  (EU) 
seminar  convened  in  Brussels  entitled  “Promoting 
confidence-building  in  support  of  a  process  aimed  at 
establishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction 
and  means  of  delivery  in  the  Middle  East”.  Israel 
is  planning  to  participate  in  the  second  EU  seminar, 
which  will  convene  in  Brussels  next  week.  Israel  also 
participated  in  the  IAEA  Director  General’s  forum  in 
November 2011, in which participants from the Middle 
East  and  other  interested  parties  could  learn  from  the 
experience  of  other  regions,  including  with  regard  to 
confidence-building  relevant 
the  establishment 
of  a  nuclear-weapon-free  zone.  That  stems  from  our 
understanding  that  only  direct  dialogue  between  the 
parties  could  move  us  to  a  more  stable  architecture  of 
regional security. 
to 
It  has  been  Israel’s  long-standing  position  that 
the  essential  preconditions  for  the  establishment  of 
the  Middle  East  as  a  mutually  verifiable  zone  free  of 
weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems 
are  comprehensive  and  durable  regional  peace  and 
full  compliance  by  all  regional  States  with  their  arms 
control, disarmament and non-proliferation obligations. 
A/67/PV.48
In  that  context,  it  should  be  recalled  that  in  the 
Middle  East,  unlike  other  regions  in  the  world  where 
nuclear-weapon-free zones have been established, there 
are continuing threats against the very existence of one 
State,  namely,  Israel.  Those  threats  are  significantly 
exacerbated  by  the  irresponsible  behaviour  of  certain 
States, in the region and beyond, and concern the export 
of  materials,  technologies  and  know-how  related  to 
weapons  of  mass  destruction  and  the  very  substantive 
discrepancies 
non-proliferation 
commitments  and 
their  actual  behaviour.  The 
international  community  should  not  overlook  the 
fact  that  four  of  the  five  widely  acknowledged  cases 
of  gross  non-compliance  with  the  Treaty  on  the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons involved Middle 
Eastern  States,  while  the  country  concerned  in  the 
fifth  case,  namely,  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic 
of Korea, is deeply involved in nuclear proliferation to 
the Middle East. 
between  States’ 
Israel  sincerely  hopes  that  the  future  will  yield 
a  more  stable  and  secure  Middle  East,  where  an 
environment  of  peace  and  reconciliation  prevails.  In 
that  context,  we  hope  that  the  positive  implications  of 
the  democratization  process  that  have  been  budding 
in  the  region  may  offer  an  opportunity  for  a  better 
atmosphere, one which could be conducive to building 
trust and confidence among the regional parties.

arsenals  in  a  concrete,  transparent,  irreversible  and 
verifiable manner, in accordance with article VI of the 
Treaty  on  the  Non-Proliferation  of  Nuclear  Weapons 
(NPT). It is our view that the unequivocal undertaking 
of  nuclear  disarmament  made  during  the  2000  NPT 
Review  Conference  lays  the  foundation  for  a  process 
that would reduce the threat posed by nuclear weapons, 
de-emphasize  their  importance  and  lead  to  their 
elimination. 
While  South  Africa  therefore  fully  supports  the 
broad thrust of resolution 67/60, we abstained on it due 
to our belief that the concrete nuclear disarmament steps 
must  still  be  undertaken  by  the  nuclear-weapon  States 
and those that maintain nuclear-weapon arsenals pending 
the  conclusion  of  a  universal,  non-discriminatory, 
legally binding agreement banning the production, use, 
stockpiling  and  development  of  nuclear  weapons  and 
that  should  contain  clearly  defined  benchmarks  and 
timelines for their complete elimination. 
As  such,  the  steps  I  have  mentioned  still  to  be 
undertaken  by  the  nuclear-weapon  States  are  distinct 
and separate from a future legally binding multilateral 
legal instrument on the elimination of nuclear weapons 
yet  to  be  negotiated.  In  that  regard,  one  preambular 
paragraph  and  two  operative  paragraphs  in  resolution 
67/60,  dealing  with  the  framework  of  time  relating 
to  a  phased  programme  for  the  complete  elimination 
of  nuclear  weapons,  unfortunately  contradict  South 
Africa’s position on this specific issue. 
Draft  decision  III  was  adopted  by  181  votes  to 
none, with 4 abstentions.
It is for that reason that my delegation abstained in 
the voting on resolution 67/60.
The Acting President: I now give the f loor to the 
representative  of  South  Africa  for  an  explanation  of 
vote.
The  Acting  President:  May  I  take  it  that  it  is  the 
wish of the General Assembly to conclude this stage of 
its consideration of agenda item 94?
Mr. Wensley (South Africa): My delegation would 
like  to  explain  its  vote  on  resolution  67/60,  entitled 
“Nuclear disarmament”.
It was so decided.
Agenda item 95
South  Africa  remains  a  staunch  supporter  of 
the  establishment  and  maintenance  of  a  nuclear-
weapon-free  world 
supports 
international efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons 
by  pursuing  and  concluding  negotiations  leading  to 
nuclear disarmament.

to

The risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East
Report of the First Committee (A/67/412) 
The Acting President: The Assembly has before it 
a draft resolution recommended by the First Committee 
in paragraph 7 of its report. 
I  now  give  the  f loor  to  the  representative  of  the 
Islamic  Republic  of  Iran,  who  wishes  to  speak  in 
explanation of vote before the voting.
Mr.  Al  Habib  (Islamic  Republic  of  Iran):  I  take 
the f loor regarding this draft resolution, on the risk of 
nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, which contains 
a reference to a 2012 conference on the establishment of 
a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
It  is  a  source  of  deepest  regret  that,  after  the 
adoption of the draft resolution by the First Committee, 
the United States announced that the conference would 
not  be  convened.  While  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Iran 
and  all  Arab  countries  announced  their  intention 
to  participate  in  the  conference,  the  United  States 
claims  that  “the  States  in  the  region  have  not  reached 
agreement on acceptable conditions for a conference”. 
But  the  truth  is  that  the  Israeli  regime  was  the  only 
party that refused to participate in the conference, a fact 
that even the United States itself could not cover up. In 
its statement, the United States said that it “would not 
support a conference in which any regional State would 
be subject to pressure or isolation”. 
In  fact,  to  avoid  such  isolation,  the  United  States, 
under the pretext of “appropriate guidelines on security 
issues in the Middle East which provide the necessary 
assurances  that  a  State  can  attend  the  conference”, 
ironically  conveys  the  preconditions  of  the  Israeli 
regime  for  participation  in  the  2012  conference. 
The  Islamic  Republic  of  Iran  strongly  rejects  any 
precondition whatsoever and by whomsoever regarding 
that conference, including for participation therein, and 
it  stresses  that  there  should  be  strong  pressure  on  that 
regime  to  participate  in  the  conference  without  any 
preconditions. 
We  fully  associate  ourselves  with  the  statement 
issued  recently  by  the  Non-Aligned  Movement  on  the 
2012 conference on the establishment of a Middle East 
zone  free  of  nuclear  weapons  and  all  other  weapons 
of  mass  destruction,  in  which  the  Movement  strongly 
rejected  the  alleged  impediments  presented  by  the 
30 
12-62440
convenors,  who  are  not  convening  the  conference  on 
schedule, and urges them all to convene the conference 
in  2012,  in  accordance  with  the  mandate  entrusted  to 
them by the Final Document (NPT/CONF.2010/50 (Vol. 
I))  of  2010  Review  Conference  of  the  Parties  to  the 
Treaty  on  the  Non-Proliferation  of  Nuclear  Weapons 
(NPT)  in  order  to  avoid  any  negative  repercussions 
for  the  relevance  and  credibility  of  the  NPT,  its  2015 
review  process  and  the  nuclear  disarmament  and 
non-proliferation regime as a whole.
The Islamic Republic of Iran once again would like 
to make it clear that the decision on the 2012 conference 
was  adopted  consensually  by  the  States  parties  to  the 
NPT.  Accordingly,  not  only  shall  any  decision  on  that 
be made by the NPT Review Conference itself, but also 
the rules of procedure of the NPT Review Conference 
shall  fully  apply  to  the  2012  conference,  including  its 
preparatory process.
The Acting President: We will now take a decision 
on  the  draft  resolution.  Separate,  recorded  votes  have 
been  requested  on  its  fifth  and  sixth  preambular 
paragraphs. 
I  shall  first  put  to  the  vote  the  fifth  preambular 
paragraph.

The  draft  resolution,  as  a  whole,  was  adopted  by 
174 votes to 6, with 6 abstentions (resolution 67/73).
The  Acting  President:  I  shall  now  give  the  f loor 
to representatives who wish to speak in explanation of 
vote  following  the  voting.  May  I  remind  delegations 
that explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and 
should be made by delegations from their seats. 
Mr.  Yanouka  (Israel):  My  explanation  of  vote 
refers  to  resolution  67/73,  just  adopted  under  agenda 
item 97, “The risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle 
East”.
Every year we question the motivation of the authors 
behind the draft resolution entitled “The risk of nuclear 
proliferation in the Middle East” and the motivation of 
the States who vote in favour of it. We cannot help but 
wonder  whether  the  distance  between  New  York  and 
the  Middle  East  is  not  stretched  unnaturally,  to  such 
an extent that their vision has been irreparably blurred. 
There  is  no  question  regarding  the  risk  of  nuclear 
proliferation in the Middle East. Israel continuously and 
consistently points to this danger. With four of five widely 
acknowledged  cases  of  gross  non-compliance  with 
obligations  under  the  Treaty  on  the  Non-Proliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) taking place in the Middle 
East  and  the  fifth  case  —  the  Democratic  People’s 
Republic of Korea — being heavily involved in nuclear 
proliferation  to  the  Middle  East,  this  seems  to  require 
no great cognitive powers. 
All  these  cases  fundamentally  challenge  Israel’s 
security  and  cast  a  dark  shadow  on  the  prospects  for 
embarking upon a meaningful regional security process. 
They also demonstrate the cynical way in which some 
regional  States  treat  their  international  commitments 
in  the  nuclear  domain,  while  they  and  others  exploit 
the  multilateral  arena  and  the  automatic  majority  that 
exists against Israel. 
In  that  context,  we  wonder  whether  the  current 
turmoil  and  transformation  processes  under  way  in 
the region will shed light on the full extent of the real 
proliferation risks in the region.
Israel  expects  that,  under  the  item  “The  risk 
of  nuclear  proliferation  in  the  Middle  East”,  the 
international community will closely look at the cases 
A/67/PV.48
of  Iran  and  Syria.  These  are  the  two  regional  States 
that  are  undergoing  investigation  by  the  International 
Atomic  Energy  Agency  (IAEA)  owing 
their 
clandestine  activities  in  contravention  of  their  NPT 
obligations.  It  cannot  be  overemphasized  that  those 
countries have been the subject of numerous resolutions 
adopted  by  the  Security  Council  and  the  IAEA  Board 
of Governors.
to 
At  a  minimum,  Israel  would  expect  a  call  for 
compliance  by  all  States  of  the  region  with  their 
relevant  international  non-proliferation  obligations. 
Lamentably,  this  resolution  chooses  to  ignore  relevant 
IAEA and Security Council resolutions, as well as the 
evidence  contained  in  IAEA  reports  regarding  Iran’s 
and Syria’s gross violations.
Adopting  such  an  ill-motivated  and  unbalanced 
resolution,  which  aims  to  single  out  Israel  in  a  biased 
manner, will not serve the greater objective of curbing 
proliferation  in  the  Middle  East,  nor  will  it  contribute 
to the role and standing of this body in advancing peace 
and  security  in  the  Middle  East.  Similarly,  it  will  not 
be consistent with the responsible behaviour we expect 
of  regional  States  and  the  international  community  at 
large if there is true interest in regional security.
Finally, the fact that the sponsors choose to include 
in this anti-Israeli resolution language referring to the 
2012 conference proves, above all, the ill intent of the 
Arab States with regard to that proposed conference. 
Mr.  Hallak  (Syrian  Arab  Republic)  (spoke  in 
Arabic): I would like to explain our vote on resolution 
67/73, entitled “The risk of nuclear proliferation in the 
Middle East”.
During  the  general  debate  and  the  substantive 
debate  in  the  First  Committee  at  this  sixty-seventh 
session,  many  of  the  statements  made  welcomed  the 
convening  of  a  conference  aimed  at  creating  a  zone 
free  of  nuclear  weapons  and  other  weapons  of  mass 
destruction  in  the  Middle  East.  The  conference  was 
to  be  held  in  Finland  in  December  2012.  However, 
such  optimism  was  unwarranted,  as  the  international 
community,  represented  by  this  Organization,  had 
not  foreseen  that  the  holding,  or  not  holding,  of  the 
conference  would  be  subject  to  the  whim  of  just  one 
party  from  the  region.  That  party  possesses  nuclear 
warheads and the delivery systems for them and is far 
from  being  in  compliance  with  obligations  under  the 
Treaty  on  the  Non-Proliferation  of  Nuclear  Weapons

(NPT).  Those  weapons  and  their  delivery  systems 
threaten international and regional peace and security. 
creation of a zone free from nuclear weapons and other 
weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. 
Shaul  Chorev,  Director  General  of  the  Israeli 
Atomic  Energy  Commission,  in  his  statement  at 
the  annual  conference  of  the  International  Atomic 
Energy  Agency  (IAEA)  in  Vienna,  underscored  that 
it  was  premature  to  hold  an  international  conference 
for  the  establishment  of  a  nuclear-weapon-free  zone 
in  the  Middle  East.  He  used  as  a  pretext  the  idea  that 
creating  a  nuclear-weapon-free  zone  in  the  Middle 
East  would  require  preconditions  and  a  change  in  the 
current direction in the region. He thereby f louted the 
international  consensus  and  the  outcome  of  the  2010 
NPT  Review  Conference  and  denied  the  fact  that  his 
country was the only country in our region that poses 
a nuclear threat. 
But  that  is  not  all.  The  United  States,  one  of  the 
sponsors of the conference, just a few days ago issued 
a  statement  through  the  official  spokesperson  of  the 
State Department, informing us that the United States 
regretted  to  announce  that  the  conference  would  not 
take place given the current situation in the Middle East 
and  the  fact  that  the  countries  of  the  region  were  not 
able  to  reach  agreement  on  acceptable  conditions  for 
its convening. 
We are surprised that the irresponsible statements 
by  Israel  and  the  United  States  —  which  stood  by 
Israel,  as  it  traditionally  does —  were  not  condemned 
by  countries  that  usually  call  for  the  maintenance  of 
international  peace  and  security,  democracy,  equality, 
respect  for  the  principles  of  international  law,  nuclear 
non-proliferation and for upholding the sacred nature of 
the NPT. Those countries saw fit to remain suspiciously 
silent when those statements were made. That is in itself 
a threatening and dangerous precedent that undermines 
the principles of the Organization. About seven decades 
ago, we all committed to respect these principles of the 
United Nations. 
Israel  has  declared  that  it  does  not  wish  to 
participate in the conference. The United States called 
for its cancellation. This is a strange and inappropriate 
way  to  abandon  one’s  collective  commitments,  which 
apply  to  all  States,  in  accordance  with  the  resolution 
on the Middle East and the Final Document of the 2010 
NPT  Review  Conference  (NPT/CONF.2010/50  (Vol. 
I)). This is a test of credibility within the international 
community  and  of  its  good  faith  with  respect  to  the 
We  have  just  heard  the  representative  of  Israel 
deliver  a  statement  that  was  like  a  piece  of  absurdist 
theatre.  With  lies  and  false  arguments,  he  accused 
certain  parties  in  order  to  distract  us  from  the  true 
danger of Israeli nuclear proliferation. Israel refuses to 
adhere to the international resolutions on this matter, to 
accede to the NPT and to submit its nuclear installations 
to IAEA safeguards and oversight. It is an open secret 
that Israel pursues an aggressive nuclear-weapon policy 
with  an  enormous  nuclear  arsenal,  including  delivery 
systems, that is larger than those of the United Kingdom 
and  France,  for  example.  Israel  has  nuclear  weapons 
but  likes  to  remain  silent,  through  a  policy  of  nuclear 
ambiguity, on the threat they pose. The representative of 
Israel makes false statements while his country refuses 
to  live  up  to  the  relevant  international  resolutions  and 
to submit its nuclear installations to IAEA inspections. 
This is ironic. 
We  call  upon  the  international  community  to 
pressure  Israel  to  accede  to  the  NPT  as  a  non-nuclear 
party,  and  ultimately  to  get  rid  of  its  nuclear  arsenal, 
including delivery systems, in order to achieve security 
and stability in our region.

The  draft  resolution,  as  a  whole,  was  adopted  by 
184 votes to 1, with 3 abstentions (resolution 67/76).
The Acting President: I now give the f loor to the 
representative of Israel in explanation of vote.
Mr.  Yanouka  (Israel):  Israel  decided  to  vote  in 
favour of resolution 67/76 because of the importance it 
attaches to the objectives of the Comprehensive Nuclear-
Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) present in the resolution. 
However,  Israel  cannot  support,  and  has  strong 
reservations regarding some of, the language, including 
in the sixth preambular paragraph and in paragraph 1. It 
is the long-standing position of Israel that the CTBT and 
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 
(NPT)  are  not  linked.  An  attempt  to  artificially  force 
such  a  linkage,  especially  through  a  reference  to  the 
NPT Review Conference — a forum that Israel is not a 
member of — would only jeopardize the CTBT and its 
noble causes, as well as any prospect for better regional 
security in the Middle East. 
Israel’s  signing  of  the  CTBT  in  1996  ref lected  its 
long-standing policy of bringing itself closer, wherever 
possible,  to  international  norms  on  nuclear  safety, 
security and non-proliferation. Since the establishment 
of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive 
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), Israel 
has  actively  participated  in  the  development  of  all 
elements  of  the  CTBT  verification  regime.  Israel  also 
transmits  data  from  its  certified  seismic  station  to  the 
International  Data  Centre  and  actively  participates  in 
various activities related to on-site inspections. 
We are pleased to announce that Israel’s radionuclide 
laboratory  supporting  the  International  Monitoring 
System  was  recently  certified.  That  substantive  and 
intensive  involvement  demonstrates  the  importance 
Israel attributes to the CTBT and its contribution to the 
enhancement of international peace and security. 
Israel  appreciates  the  significant  progress  made 
in  the  development  of  the  CTBT  verification  regime, 
whose  completion  is  a  prerequisite  to  the  entry 
into  force  of  the  Treaty.  However,  completing  the 
verification regime still requires further efforts. Major 
steps  are  still  needed  for  the  continued  build-up  and 
testing of the International Monitoring System stations, 
the  completion  of  the  on-site  inspection  operational 
manual,  and  equipment  purchase  and  training.  In  that 
connection, we commend the Executive Secretary and 
the  Provisional  Technical  Secretariat  of  the  CTBT  for 
36 
12-62440
its  ongoing  work  and  preparations  for  the  Integrated 
Field Exercise 2014, to be hosted in Jordan.
On  behalf  of  the  Government  of  Israel,  I  would 
like to congratulate Mr. Lassina Zerbo on his election 
as  the  next  Executive  Secretary  of  the  Preparatory 
Commission  for  the  CTBTO  and  wish  him  fruitful 
work. I also wish to take this opportunity to commend 
the  outgoing  Executive  Secretary,  Ambassador  Tibor 
Tóth, for his leadership and efforts in connection with 
the verification regime. 
For  Israel,  the  regional  security  situation  in  the 
Middle  East,  including  adherence  to  and  compliance 
with  the  Treaty  by  States  in  the  region,  is  a  major 
consideration for ratification. It is Israel’s view that the 
Treaty’s  verification  regime  should  be  robust  enough 
to detect non-compliance with its basic obligations, be 
immune to abuse and at the same time allow each State 
signatory to protect its national security interests. 
For Israel, the completion of the verification regime 
constitutes a major consideration for ratification, as we 
would  like  to  ensure  that  there  is  adequate  coverage 
of  the  Middle  East  by  the  International  Monitoring 
System. In addition, Israel’s status in the policymaking 
organs  of  the  Treaty,  including  those  connected  to the 
geographical  regions  of  the  Middle  East  and  South 
Asia,  and  in  the  Executive  Council  of  the  future 
CTBTO, must be addressed. Sovereign equality, which 
is a cornerstone of multilateralism, must be ensured.
Pending  its  entry  into  force,  we  believe  that  the 
CTBT should be advanced further by States taking upon 
themselves  the  following  commitments  and  activities. 
They  must  maintain  the  commitment  not  to  carry  out 
any  nuclear-weapon  test  explosion,  in  line  with  the 
Treaty’s  basic  obligations,  and  complete  as  soon  as 
possible  the  CTBT  verification  regime.  States  must 
operate, maintain and test the International Monitoring 
System and International Data Centre in order to gain 
experience  and  provide  early  detection  capabilities 
and,  where  there  are  coverage  gaps  of  International 
Monitoring  System  stations,  take  temporary  measures 
to  fill  those  gaps,  such  as  operating  auxiliary  seismic 
stations  as  primary  ones  until  all  primary  stations  are 
effectively  functioning  and  transferring  data.  And 
States must maintain the technical and apolitical nature 
of the work of the Preparatory Commission and respect 
its rules and procedures. 
As we have done in previous years, Israel voted in 
favour of this resolution. Our voting pattern stems from 
A/67/PV.48
and ref lects the importance we attach to the objectives 
of  the  CTBT.  It  is  our  hope  that  they  will  be  realized 
faithfully and in a forthcoming manner.
