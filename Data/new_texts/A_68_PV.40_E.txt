The meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.
Agenda item 115
Elections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and 
other elections
(a) Election of seven members of the Committee for 
Programme and Coordination
Note by the Secretary-General (A/68/302)
The  President:  Pursuant  to  General  Assembly 
decision  42/450,  of  17  December  1987,  and  upon 
nomination  by  the  Economic  and  Social  Council,  the 
Assembly  elects  the  members  of  the  Committee  for 
Programme and Coordination.
The  Assembly  has  before  it  document  A/68/302, 
which contains the nominations by the Economic and 
Social Council to fill the vacancies in the Committee 
that  will  occur  as  a  result  of  the  expiration  on 
31  December  2013  of  the  terms  of  office  of  Algeria, 
Antigua  and  Barbuda,  Benin,  China,  Eritrea,  Japan 
and the Republic of Korea. Those States are eligible for 
immediate re-election.
I should like to remind members that, after 1 January 
2014, the following States will remain members of the 
Committee:  Argentina,  Botswana,  Belarus,  Brazil, 
Bulgaria,  Cameroon,  Cuba,  El  Salvador,  France, 
Guinea,  Guinea-Bissau, 
the  Islamic  Republic  of 
Iran,  Italy,  Kazakhstan,  Malaysia,  Pakistan,  Peru, 
the  Republic  of  Moldova,  the  Russian  Federation,  the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 
the United Republic of Tanzania, the United States of 
America, Uruguay and Zimbabwe. Those 24 States are 
therefore not eligible in this election.
I  should  now  like  to  inform  members  that  the 
following States have been nominated by the Economic 
and Social Council: Benin and Ethiopia for two of the 
three seats among the African States; China and Japan 
for two of the three seats among the Asia-Pacific States; 
and Haiti for the one seat among the Latin American 
and Caribbean States;
In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, 
all elections should be held by secret ballot and there 
shall  be  no  nominations.  However,  I  should  like  to 
recall  paragraph  16  of  General  Assembly  decision 
34/401,  whereby  the  practice  of  dispensing  with  the 
secret  ballot  for  elections  to  subsidiary  organs  when 
the  number  of  candidates  corresponds  to  the  number 
of  seats  to  be  filled  should  become  standard,  unless 
a  delegation  specifically  requests  a  vote  on  a  given 
election. Today is not that day.
In the absence of such a request, may I take it that 
the Assembly decides to proceed to the election on the 
basis of dispensing with the secret ballot?
It was so decided.
The  President:  The  number  of  States  nominated 
from among the African States, the Asia-Pacific States 
and the Latin American and Caribbean States is equal 
to or less than the number of seats to be filled in each 
of those groups.
May  I  therefore  take  it  that  the  Assembly  wishes 
to  declare  those  States  nominated  by  the  Economic

and  Social  Council  —  Benin,  China,  Ethiopia,  Haiti 
and  Japan  —  elected  members  of  the  Committee  for 
Programme and Coordination for a three-year term of 
office beginning on 1 January 2014?
It was so decided.
The  President:  I  congratulate  the  States  that 
have just been elected members of the Committee for 
Programme and Coordination.
Members  are  reminded  that  the  Economic  and 
Social  Council  postponed  the  nomination  of  one 
member from the African States and one member from 
the  Asia-Pacific  States  for  election  for  a  three-year 
term beginning on 1 January 2014. Members are also 
reminded that there remain two vacancies from among 
the  Western  European  and  other  States  for  terms 
beginning  on  the  date  of  election  and  expiring  on 
31 December 2014, and one vacancy, also from among 
the  Western  European  and  other  States,  for  a  term 
beginning on the date of appointment and expiring on 
31 December 2015. The General Assembly will be in a 
position to act on those vacancies upon nomination by 
the Economic and Social Council.
thus  concluded 
this  stage  of  our 
We  have 
consideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 115.
Agenda item 114 (continued)
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs
(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic 
and Social Council
The  President:  The  General  Assembly  will  now 
proceed to the election of 18 members of the Economic 
and  Social  Council  to  replace  those  members  whose 
term of office expires on 31 December 2013.
The 18 outgoing members are: Bulgaria, Cameroon, 
China,  Denmark,  Ecuador,  Gabon,  Latvia,  Malawi, 
Mexico, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Qatar, the 
Republic  of  Korea,  the  Russian  Federation,  Senegal, 
Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland. Pursuant to rule 146 of the rules of 
procedure,  those  countries  are  eligible  for  immediate 
re-election.
As  of  1  January  2014,  the  following  States  will 
be  represented  on  the  Economic  and  Social  Council: 
Albania, Austria, Belarus, Benin, the Plurinational State 
of  Bolivia,  Brazil,  Burkina  Faso,  Canada,  Colombia, 
Croatia,  Cuba,  the  Dominican  Republic,  El  Salvador, 
Ethiopia, France, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, 
Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lesotho, Libya, Mauritius, Nepal, 
the  Netherlands,  Nigeria,  San  Marino,  South  Africa, 
Spain,  the  Sudan,  Tunisia,  Turkey,  Turkmenistan  and 
the  United  States  of  America.  The  names  of  those 
36 States should therefore not appear on the ballots.
In  accordance  with  paragraph  4  of  General 
Assembly  resolution  2847  (XXVI),  of  20  December 
1971, and taking into account the number of States that 
will  remain  members  of  the  Council  after  1  January 
2014, the 18 members should be elected as follows: four 
from  African  States,  four  from  Asia-Pacific  States, 
three from Eastern European States, three from Latin 
American  and  Caribbean  States  and  four  from  the 
Western European and other States. The ballot papers 
reflect that pattern.
I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  those 
candidates — their number not exceeding the number 
of seats to be filled — that receive a two-thirds majority 
and the greatest number of votes by members present 
and  voting,  will  be  declared  elected.  Consistent  with 
past practice, in the case of a tie vote making it necessary 
to  determine  the  candidate  to  be  elected  or  that  will 
proceed to the next round of restricted balloting, there 
will  be  a  special  restricted  ballot  limited  to  those 
candidates that have obtained an equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to 
these procedures?
It was so decided.
The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the 
rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret 
ballot, and there shall be no nominations.
Regarding candidatures of the respective regional 
groups,  the  Secretariat  has  been  informed  of  the 
following.  For  the  four  vacant  seats  from  among  the 
African States, the Group has endorsed four candidates: 
Botswana, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic 
Republic  of  the  Congo  and  Togo.  For  the  four  vacant 
seats  from  among  the  Asia-Pacific  States,  the  Group 
has  endorsed  four  candidates:  Bangladesh,  China, 
Kazakhstan  and  the  Republic  of  Korea.  For  the  three 
vacant seats from among the Eastern European States, 
the Group has endorsed three candidates: Georgia, the 
Russian  Federation  and  Serbia.  For  the  three  vacant 
seats  from  among  the  Latin  American  and  Caribbean 
States,  the  Group  has  endorsed  three  candidates: 
Antigua and Barbuda, Guatemala and Panama. For the

four  vacant  seats  from  among  the  Western  European 
and  other  States, 
the  Group  has  endorsed  four 
candidates:  Denmark,  New  Zealand,  Sweden  and  the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, 
we shall now proceed to the election by secret ballot.
Before we begin the voting process, I should like to 
remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of 
procedure of the General Assembly, no representative 
shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a  point  of  order 
on the actual conduct of the voting. In addition, ballot 
papers will be given only to the representative seated 
directly behind the country’s name plate.
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Ballot 
papers  marked  “A”,  “B”,  “C”,  “D”  and  “E”  will  now 
be  distributed.  I  request  representatives  to  use  only 
those ballot papers and to write on them the names of 
the States for which they wish to vote. A ballot will be 
declared invalid if it contains more names of Member 
States from the relevant region than the number of seats 
assigned to it. A ballot will also be declared invalid if 
none of the names of the Member States on that ballot 
belongs  to  the  relevant  region.  If  a  ballot  paper  of  a 
region contains both the names of Member States that 
belong  to  and  that  are  outside  that  region,  the  ballot 
remains valid but only the names of the Member States 
that belong to the relevant region will be counted. The 
names  of  Member  States  that  do  not  belong  to  that 
region will not be counted.
