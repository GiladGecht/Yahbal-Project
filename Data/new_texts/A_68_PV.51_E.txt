States; four seats for the Asia-Pacific States; two seats 
for the Eastern European States; two seats for the Latin 
American and Caribbean States; and two seats for the

Members  of  the  United  Nations  and  the  members  of

The members of the Council shall be elected directly 
and  individually,  by  secret  ballot,  by  the  majority  of 
the  members  of  the  General  Assembly.  Accordingly, 
97 votes constitute a majority in the General Assembly, 
which has a membership of 193 States.
In accordance with paragraphs 4 and 5 of resolution 
65/281, of 17 June 2011, beginning in 2013 the Human 
Rights Council will start its yearly membership cycle on 
1 January and, as a transitional measure, the period of

States  have  obtained  the  votes  of  the  majority  of  the 
members  of  the  Assembly  on  the  same  ballot,  those 
Member  States  that  have  obtained  the  largest  number 
of votes above the required majority will be considered 
as elected, up to the number of seats to be filled.
Also, consistent with past practice, in case, due to 
a tie vote, it should become necessary to determine one 
candidate to be elected or that will proceed to the next 
round  of  restricted  balloting,  there  will  be  a  special 
restricted  ballot  limited  to  those  candidates  that  have 
obtained an equal number of votes
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to 
these procedures?
It was so decided.
The President: Accordingly, the election shall be 
held by secret ballot, and there shall be no nominations.
Again,  I  should  like  to  repeat  that  the  14  vacant 
seats are to be filled from among the regional groups as 
follows: four seats from among the African States; four 
seats  from  among  the  Asia-Pacific  States;  two  seats 
from  among  the  Eastern  European  States;  two  seats 
from among the Latin American and Caribbean States; 
and two seats from among the Western European and 
other States. The ballot papers reflect that pattern.
In addition, I have been informed by the Secretariat 
that  voluntary  pledges  and  commitments  made  by 
Member  States  in  accordance  with  paragraph  8  of 
resolution  60/251  were  accordingly  issued  as  official 
documents  of  the  sixty-eighth  session  of  the  General 
Assembly.
Before we begin the voting process, I should like to 
remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of 
procedure of the General Assembly, no representative 
shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order on 
the actual conduct of the voting.
In  addition,  ballot  papers  will  be  given  only  to 
the representative seated directly behind the country’s 
nameplate.
I  should  like  to  seek  the  usual  cooperation  of 
representatives  during  the  time  when  the  General 
Assembly is conducting the elections.
that  during 
Please  be  reminded 
the  voting 
procedure, all campaigning should cease in the General 
Assembly Hall. That means that, once the meeting has 
begun, no more campaign material can be distributed 
inside the Hall.

All representatives are also requested to remain at 
their seats so that the voting process can proceed in an 
orderly manner.
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Ballot 
papers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E” will now be 
distributed. Each ballot paper is assigned to one of the 
five regional groups and has the corresponding number 
of blank lines for the seats assigned to that region.
I  request  representatives  to  use  only  those  ballot 
papers  and  to  write  on  them  the  names  of  the  States 
for which they wish to vote. A ballot paper containing 
more names from the relevant region than the number 
of  seats  assigned  to  it  will  be  declared  invalid.  A 
ballot will also be declared invalid if all the names of 
the Member States on that ballot do not belong to the 
relevant  region.  If  a  ballot  paper  of  a  region  includes 
both  the  names  of  Member  States  that  belong  to  and 
that are from outside of that region, the ballot remains 
valid  but  only  the  names  of  the  Member  States  that 
belong to the relevant region will be counted. If a ballot 
paper  contains  names  of  Member  States  that  are  not 
eligible for re-election or that are currently members of 
the Council, the ballot remains valid, but those names 
will not be counted.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Hawezy (Iraq), 
Ms.  Johnson  (Jamaica),  Mr.  Isakov  (Kyrgyzstan), 
Ms. Cortes Palma (Portugal), Mr. Fawundu (Sierra 
Leone),  Mrs.  Kramberger  Mendek 
(Slovenia), 
Mr. Tazo (Togo) and Ms. Özaydın (Turkey) acted as 
tellers.
A vote was taken by secret ballot.
The  meeting  was  suspended  at  10.25  a.m.  and 
resumed at 11.25 a.m.
