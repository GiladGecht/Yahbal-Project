The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.
Agenda item 111
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs
(a) Election of five non-permanent members of the 
Security Council
The  President:  The  General  Assembly  will  now 
proceed to the election of five non-permanent members 
of the Security Council to replace those members whose 
term of office expires on 31 December 2014.
The  five  outgoing  non-permanent  members  are 
the  following:  Argentina,  Australia,  Luxembourg, 
the Republic of Korea and Rwanda. Those five States 
cannot be re-elected. Their names therefore should not 
appear on the ballot papers.
Apart  from  the  five  permanent  members,  the 
Security  Council  will  include  in  the  year  2015  the 
following  States:  Chad,  Chile,  Jordan,  Lithuania  and 
Nigeria.  The  names  of  those  States  therefore  should 
also not appear on the ballot papers.
Of  the  five  non-permanent  members  that  will 
remain in office in the year 2015, three are from Africa 
and the Asia-Pacific region, one is from Eastern Europe 
and  one  is  from  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean. 
Consequently,  pursuant  to  paragraph  3  of  resolution 
1991  A  (XVIII),  of  17  December  1963,  the  five 
non-permanent  members  should  be  elected  according 
to  the  following  pattern:  two  from  the  African  and 
Asia-Pacific States, one from the Latin American and 
Caribbean States and two from the Western European 
and Other States. The ballot papers reflect that pattern.
In  accordance  with  established  practice,  there  is 
an  understanding  to  the  effect  that,  of  the  two  States 
to be elected from among the African and Asia-Pacific 
States,  one  should  be  from  Africa  and  one  should  be 
from the Asia-Pacific region.
I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  those 
candidates  -  their  number  not  exceeding  the  number 
of  seats  to  be  filled  -  receiving  the  greatest  number 
of  votes  and  a  two-thirds  majority  of  those  present 
and  voting  will  be  declared  elected.  If  the  number  of 
candidates obtaining a two-thirds majority is less than 
the  number  of  members  to  be  elected,  there  shall  be 
additional ballots to fill the remaining places, the voting 
being restricted to the candidates obtaining the greatest 
number of votes in the previous ballot to a number not 
more than twice the places remaining to be filled.
Also, consistent with past practice, in case a tie vote 
should  make  it  necessary  to  determine  the  candidate 
to be elected or that will proceed to the next round of 
restricted  balloting,  there  will  be  a  special  restricted 
ballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an 
equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to 
those procedures?
It was so decided.
The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the 
rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret 
ballot and there shall be no nominations.

Regarding candidatures, I have been informed by 
the  Chairpersons  of  the  respective  regional  groups  of 
the following. For the two vacant seats from among the 
African and Asia-Pacific States, there are two endorsed 
candidates,  namely,  Angola  and  Malaysia.  For  the 
one  vacant  seat  from  among  the  Latin  American  and 
Caribbean  States,  there  is  one  endorsed  candidate, 
namely, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. For the 
two  vacant  seats  from  among  the  Western  European 
and  Other  States,  there  are  three  candidates,  namely, 
New Zealand, Spain and Turkey.
In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, 
we shall now proceed to the election by secret ballot.
I  should  like  to  seek  the  usual  cooperation  of 
representatives  during  the  time  of  the  conduct  of  the 
election.  Please  be  reminded  that  during  the  voting 
process,  all  campaigning  should  cease  in  the  General 
Assembly  Hall.  That  means  in  particular  that  once 
the meeting has begun, no campaign materials can be 
distributed  inside  the  Hall.  All  participants  are  also 
requested  to  remain  in  their  seats  so  that  the  voting 
process can proceed in an orderly manner. I thank them 
for their cooperation.
I should also like to remind members of the press 
not  to  focus  their  cameras  on  delegations  during  the 
voting process, taking into account that this is a secret 
ballot, in accordance with the rules of procedure of the 
General Assembly. I thank them for their cooperation.
Before we begin the voting process, I should like to 
remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of 
procedure of the General Assembly, no representative 
shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a  point  of  order 
on the actual conduct of the voting. In addition, ballot 
papers will be given only to the representative seated 
directly behind the country’s nameplate.
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Members 
are  requested  to  remain  seated  until  all  ballots  have 
been collected.
Ballot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” will now be 
distributed. I request representatives to use only those 
ballot  papers  that  have  been  distributed.  If  there  are 
others, I ask that they not be used.
May  I  ask  representatives  to  write  on  the  ballot 
papers  marked  “A”,  for  the  African  and  Asia-Pacific 
States, the names of the two States for which they wish 
to vote; on the ballot papers marked “B”, for the Latin 
American  and  Caribbean  States,  the  name  of  the  one 
State  for  which  they  wish  to  vote;  and  on  the  ballot 
papers  marked  “C”,  for  the  Western  European  and 
Other States, the names of the two States for which they 
wish to vote.
A ballot will be declared invalid if it contains more 
names of Member States from the relevant region than 
the number of seats assigned to it. A ballot will also be 
declared invalid if all the names of the Member States 
on  that  ballot  do  not  belong  to  the  relevant  region.  If 
a  ballot  paper  of  a  region  includes  both  the  names  of 
Member States that belong to and that do not belong to 
that region, the ballot remains valid, but only the names 
of the Member States that belong to the relevant region 
will be counted. The names of Member States that do 
not belong to that region will not be counted.
At the invitation of the President, Ms. Chan (Costa Rica), 
Ms.  Abrahamsen  (Finland),  Ms.  Reich  (Hungary), 
Mr.  Kurer  (Libya),  Ms.  Bidaoui  (Netherlands)  and
