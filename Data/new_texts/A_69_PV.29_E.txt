The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.
Agenda item 112
Elections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and 
other elections
(c)  Election of fifteen members of the Human 
Rights Council
The  President:  The  General  Assembly  will  now 
proceed with the election of 15 members of the Human 
Rights Council to replace those members whose term of 
office expires on 31 December 2014.
The  15  outgoing  members  are  Austria,  Benin, 
Botswana, Burkina Faso, Chile, the Congo, Costa Rica, 
the  Czech  Republic,  India,  Indonesia,  Italy,  Kuwait, 
Peru, the Philippines and Romania.
In  accordance  with  paragraph  7  of  resolution 
60/251  of  15  March  2006,  those  Member  States  are 
eligible  for  immediate  re-election,  except  those  that 
have  served  two  consecutive  terms,  namely,  Burkina 
Faso and Chile.
The  15  vacant  seats  should  be  distributed  among 
the  regional  groups  as  follows:  four  seats  for  the 
African  States;  four  seats  for  the  Asia-Pacific  States; 
two seats for the Eastern European States; three seats 
for the Latin American and Caribbean States; and two 
seats for the Western European and Other States.
In accordance with resolution 60/251, membership 
in the Council shall be open to all States Members of 
the  United  Nations,  and  the  members  of  the  Council 
shall serve for a period of three years. The members of 
the Council shall be elected directly and individually, 
by secret ballot, by the majority of the members of the 
General  Assembly.  Accordingly,  97  votes  constitute 
a  majority  in  the  General  Assembly,  which  has  a 
membership of 193 States.
In accordance with paragraphs 4 and 5 of resolution 
65/281 of 17 June 2011, beginning in 2013 the Human 
Rights Council will start its yearly membership cycle 
on 1 January and, as a transitional measure, the period 
of  office  of  members  of  the  Human  Rights  Council 
ending  in  June  2014  has  been  exceptionally  extended 
until the end of the calendar year.
The following States will continue to be members 
of  the  Human  Rights  Council:  Algeria,  Argentina, 
Brazil, China, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, Estonia, Ethiopia, 
France, Gabon, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Kazakhstan, 
Kenya,  Maldives,  Mexico,  Montenegro,  Morocco, 
Namibia, Pakistan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian 
Federation, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, South Africa, 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the United 
Arab  Emirates,  the  United  Kingdom  of  Great  Britain 
and Northern Ireland, the United States of America, the 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and Viet Nam. The 
names  of  those  States  therefore  should  not  appear  on 
the ballot papers.
The  election  will  be  held  in  accordance  with  the 
relevant rules of procedure of the General Assembly on 
elections. For this election, rules 92 and 94 of the rules 
of procedure shall be applied.

Consistent  with 
the  practice  of 
the  General 
Assembly, if more than the required number of Member 
States  have  obtained  the  votes  of  the  majority  of  the 
members  of  the  Assembly  on  the  same  ballot,  those 
Member  States  that  have  obtained  the  largest  number 
of votes above the required majority will be considered 
as elected, up to the number of seats to be filled. Also, 
consistent with past practice, in case, due to a tie vote, 
it should become necessary to determine one candidate 
to be elected or that will proceed to the next round of 
restricted  balloting,  there  will  be  a  special  restricted 
ballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an 
equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to 
these procedures?
It was so decided.
The President: Accordingly, the election shall be 
held by secret ballot, and there shall be no nominations.
Again,  I  should  like  to  repeat  that  the  15  vacant 
seats are to be filled from among the regional groups as 
follows: four seats from among the African States; four 
seats  from  among  the  Asia-Pacific  States;  two  seats 
from  among  the  Eastern  European  States;  three  seats 
from among the Latin American and Caribbean States; 
and two seats from among the Western European and 
other States. The ballot papers reflect that pattern.
In addition, I have been informed by the Secretariat 
that  voluntary  pledges  and  commitments  made  by 
Member  States  in  accordance  with  paragraph  8  of 
resolution  60/251  were  accordingly 
issued,  when 
received  on  time  before  the  elections,  as  official 
documents  of  the  sixty-ninth  session  of  the  General 
Assembly.
Before we begin the voting process, I should like to 
remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of 
procedure of the General Assembly, no representative 
shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a  point  of  order 
on the actual conduct of the voting. In addition, ballot 
papers will be given only to the representative seated 
directly behind the country’s nameplate.
I  should  like  to  seek  the  usual  cooperation  of 
representatives  during  the  time  when  the  General 
Assembly is conducting the elections. I remind them that 
during  the  voting  procedure,  all  campaigning  should 
cease in the General Assembly Hall. That means that, 
once the meeting has begun, no more campaign material 
can be distributed inside the Hall. All representatives 
are  also  requested  to  remain  at  their  seats  so  that  the 
voting  process  can  proceed  in  an  orderly  manner.  I 
should also like to remind delegations to refrain from 
extending  congratulations  in  the  General  Assembly 
Hall after the announcement of the elected members. It 
is disruptive to the distribution of ballot papers for any 
subsequent rounds of balloting. I thank representatives 
for their cooperation.
I would also like to remind members of the media 
not  to  focus  their  cameras  on  delegations  during  the 
voting process, taking into account that this is a secret 
ballot in accordance with the rules of procedures of the 
General  Assembly.  I  thank  members  of  the  media  for 
their cooperation.
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Ballot 
papers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E” will now be 
distributed. Each ballot paper is assigned to one of the 
five regional groups and has the corresponding number 
of blank lines for the seats assigned to that region.
I  request  representatives  to  use  only  those  ballot 
papers  and  to  write  on  them  the  names  of  the  States 
for which they wish to vote. A ballot paper containing 
more names from the relevant region than the number 
of  seats  assigned  to  it  will  be  declared  invalid.  A 
ballot will also be declared invalid if all the names of 
the Member States on that ballot do not belong to the 
relevant  region.  If  a  ballot  paper  of  a  region  includes 
both  the  names  of  Member  States  that  belong  to  and 
that are from outside of that region, the ballot remains 
valid  but  only  the  names  of  the  Member  States  that 
belong to the relevant region will be counted. If a ballot 
paper  contains  names  of  Member  States  that  are  not 
eligible for re-election or that are currently members of 
the Council, the ballot remains valid, but those names 
will not be counted.
At  the  invitation  of  the  President,  Ms.  Andujar 
(Dominican Republic), Ms. Lobo Juarez (Honduras), 
Mrs. Oanţă (Romania), Mr. Shaker (Saudi Arabia), 
Mr.  Kunene 
(Swaziland)  and  Ms.  Mattsson 
(Sweden) acted as tellers.
A vote was taken by secret ballot.
The  meeting  was  suspended  at  10.25  a.m.  and 
resumed at 11.35 a.m.
The  President:  The  result  of  the  voting  is  as 
follows:
