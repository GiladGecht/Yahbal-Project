The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.
Agenda items 112 (continued)
Elections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and 
other elections
(a) Election of twenty members of the Committee 
for Programme and Coordination
Note by the Secretary-General (A/69/291)
The  President:  Pursuant  to  General  Assembly 
decision  42/450,  of  17  December  1987,  and  upon 
nomination  by  the  Economic  and  Social  Council,  the 
Assembly  elects  the  members  of  the  Committee  for 
Programme and Coordination.
The  Assembly  has  before  it  document  A/69/291, 
which contains the nominations by the Economic and 
Social Council to fill the vacancies in the Committee that 
will occur as a result of the expiration on 31 December 
2014  of  the  terms  of  office  of  Argentina,  Belarus, 
Brazil,  Bulgaria,  Cameroon,  Cuba,  Guinea,  Guinea-
Bissau, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, Kazakhstan, 
Malaysia,  Pakistan,  the  Republic  of  Moldova,  the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 
the United States of America, Uruguay and Zimbabwe. 
Those States are eligible for immediate re-election.
I should like to remind members that after 1 January 
2015, the following States will remain members of the 
Committee:  Benin,  Botswana,  China,  El  Salvador, 
Ethiopia,  France,  Haiti,  Japan,  Morocco,  Peru,  the 
Republic  of  Korea,  the  Russian  Federation  and  the 
United Republic of Tanzania. Those 13 States therefore 
are not eligible in this election.
I  should  now  like  to  inform  members  that  the 
following States have been nominated by the Economic 
and  Social  Council:  Burkina  Faso,  Cameroon, 
Equatorial  Guinea  and  Namibia  for  the  four  seats 
among the African States; the Islamic Republic of Iran 
for one of the four seats among the Asia-Pacific States; 
Armenia,  Belarus  and  Ukraine  for  three  seats  among 
the  Eastern  European  States;  Brazil,  Cuba,  Uruguay 
and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for the four 
seats among the Latin American and Caribbean States; 
and Italy for one of the five seats among the Western 
European and other States.
In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, 
all elections should be held by secret ballot and there 
shall  be  no  nominations.  However,  I  should  like  to 
recall  paragraph  16  of  General  Assembly  decision 
34/401,  whereby  the  practice  of  dispensing  with  the 
secret  ballot  for  elections  to  subsidiary  organs  when 
the  number  of  candidates  corresponds  to  the  number 
of  seats  to  be  filled  should  become  standard,  unless 
a  delegation  specifically  requests  a  vote  on  the  given 
election.
In the absence of such a request, may I take it that 
the Assembly decides to proceed to the election on the 
basis of dispensing with the secret ballot?
It was so decided.
The  President:  The  number  of  States  nominated 
from among the African States, the Asia-Pacific States,

the Eastern European States, the Latin American and 
Caribbean States and the Western European and other 
States is equal to or less than the number of seats to be 
filled in each of those groups.
May I therefore take it that the Assembly wishes to 
declare  those  States  nominated  by  the  Economic  and 
Social  Council  -  Armenia,  Belarus,  Brazil,  Burkina 
Faso, Cameroon, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, Italy, Namibia, Ukraine, Uruguay and 
the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela - elected members 
of the Committee for Programme and Coordination for 
three-year terms of office, beginning 1 January 2015?
It was so decided.
The  President:  I  congratulate  the  States  that 
have just been elected members of the Committee for 
Programme and Coordination.
Members  are  reminded  that  the  Economic  and 
Social  Council  postponed  the  nomination  of  three 
members  from  Asia-Pacific  States  and  four  members 
from  Western  European  and  other  States  for  election 
to  a  three-year  term  beginning  on  1  January  2015. 
Members  are  also  reminded  that  there  remain  two 
vacancies  from  among  Western  European  and  other 
States, for a term beginning on the date of election and 
expiring on 31 December 2014, and one vacancy also 
from among the Western European and other States, for 
a term beginning on the date of election and expiring 
on 31 December 2015. The General Assembly will be in 
a position to act on those vacancies upon nomination by 
the Economic and Social Council.
The Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its 
consideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 112.
Agenda item 111 (continued)
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs
(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic 
and Social Council
The  President:  The  General  Assembly  will  now 
proceed to the election of 18 members of the Economic 
and  Social  Council  to  replace  those  members  whose 
term of office expires on 31 December 2014.
Pursuant  to  rule  146  of  the  rules  of  procedure,  those 
countries are eligible for immediate re-election.
As  of  1  January  2015,  the  following  States  will 
be  represented  on  the  Economic  and  Social  Council: 
Albania,  Antigua  and  Barbuda,  Bangladesh,  Benin, 
the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Botswana, Canada, 
China, Colombia, the Congo, Croatia, the Democratic 
Republic  of  Congo,  Denmark,  Georgia,  Guatemala, 
Haiti, 
Italy,  Kazakhstan,  Kuwait,  Kyrgyzstan, 
Mauritius, Nepal, New Zealand, Panama, the Republic 
of Korea, the Russian Federation, San Marino, Serbia, 
South  Africa,  the  Sudan,  Sweden,  Togo,  Tunisia, 
Turkmenistan,  the  United  Kingdom  of  Great  Britain 
and Northern Ireland and the United States of America. 
The  names  of  those  36  States  should  therefore  not 
appear on the ballots.
In  accordance  with  paragraph  4  of  General 
Assembly  resolution  2847  (XXVI),  of  20  December 
1971, and taking into account the number of States that 
will  remain  members  of  the  Council  after  1  January 
2015, the 18 members should be elected as follows: five 
from  African  States,  three  from  Asia-Pacific  States, 
one  from  Eastern  European  States,  four  from  Latin 
American and Caribbean States and five from Western 
European  and  other  States.  The  ballot  papers  reflect 
that pattern.
I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  those 
candidates - their number not exceeding the number of 
seats to be filled - that receive a two-thirds majority and 
the greatest number of votes by members present and 
voting,  will  be  declared  elected.  Consistent  with  past 
practice, in the case of a tie vote making it necessary 
to  determine  the  candidate  to  be  elected  or  that  will 
proceed to the next round of restricted balloting, there 
will  be  a  special  restricted  ballot  limited  to  those 
candidates that have obtained an equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to 
those procedures?
It was so decided.
The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the 
rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret 
ballot, and there shall be no nominations.
The  18  outgoing  members  are:  Austria,  Belarus, 
Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, 
El Salvador, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Greece, India, 
Indonesia, Japan, Lesotho, Libya, Nigeria and Portugal. 
Regarding  candidates  of  the  respective  regional 
groups,  the  secretariat  has  been  informed  of  the 
following.  For  the  five  vacant  seats  from  among 
the  African  States,  the  Group  has  endorsed  five 
2/4 
14-59375

A/69/PV.32
candidates: Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mauritania, Uganda 
and Zimbabwe. For the three vacant seats from among 
the Asia-Pacific States, the Group has endorsed three 
candidates:  India,  Japan  and  Pakistan.  For  the  one 
vacant seat from among the Eastern European States, 
the  Group  has  endorsed  one  candidate:  Estonia.  For 
the four vacant seats from among the Latin American 
and  Caribbean  States,  the  Group  has  endorsed  four 
candidates: Argentina, Brazil, Honduras and Trinidad 
and Tobago. For the five vacant seats from among the 
Western European and other States, the Group has five 
candidates:  Austria,  France,  Germany,  Greece  and 
Portugal.
In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, 
we shall now proceed to the election by secret ballot.
Before we begin the voting process, I should like to 
remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of 
procedure of the General Assembly, no representative 
shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a  point  of  order 
on the actual conduct of the voting. In addition, ballot 
papers will be given only to the representatives seated 
directly behind the country’s name plate.
I  should  like  to  seek  the  cooperation  of  the 
representatives  during  the  time  of  the  conduct  of  the 
election.  Please  be  reminded  that  during  the  voting 
process  all  campaigning  should  cease  in  the  General 
Assembly Hall. That means in particular that once the 
meeting  has  begun,  no  more  campaign  materials  can 
be  distributed  inside  the  Hall.  All  representatives  are 
also requested to remain in their seats so that the voting 
process  can  proceed  in  an  orderly  manner.  I  thank 
members for their cooperation.
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Ballot 
papers are marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E” will now 
be  distributed.  I  request  representatives  to  use  only 
those ballot papers and to write on them the names of 
the States for which they wish to vote. A ballot will be 
declared invalid if it contains more names of Member 
States from the relevant region than the number of seats 
assigned to it. The ballot papers will also be declared 
invalid if none of the names of the Member States on 
that  ballot  belong  to  the  relevant  region.  If  the  ballot 
paper of the region contains both names of the Member 
States that belong to and that are outside that region, the 
ballot remains valid but only the names of the Member 
States that belong to the relevant region will be counted. 
The names of Member States that do not belong to that 
region will not be counted.
