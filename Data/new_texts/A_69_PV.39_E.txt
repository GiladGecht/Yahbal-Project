The  President:  Today  the  General  Assembly 
will  proceed  to  the  election  of  five  members  of  the 
International  Court  of  Justice  for  a  nine-year  term  of 
office  commencing  on  6  February  2015.  The  judges 
whose  terms  of  office  expire  on  5  February  2015  are 
Judge  Mohamed  Bennouna  (Morocco),  Judge  Joan  E. 
Donoghue (United States of America), Judge Kenneth 
Keith  (New  Zealand),  Judge  Bernardo  Sepúlveda-
Amor (Mexico) and Judge Leonid Skotnikov (Russian 
Federation).
I should like to draw the attention of the General 
Assembly to the documents it has before it relating to this 
election. Document A/69/230 contains a memorandum 
by  the  Secretary-General  on  the  current  composition 
of  the  Court  and  on  the  procedures  to  be  followed  in 
the  General  Assembly  and  the  Security  Council  with 
regard to the election. Document A/69/253 contains the 
list  of  candidates  nominated  by  national  groups.  And 
document A/69/254 contains the curricula vitae of the 
candidates nominated by national groups.
In that connection, the Legal Counsel has informed 
me  that  after  the  deadline  established  for  nominating 
candidates, the following additional submissions were 
received  from  several  national  groups,  all  of  which 
relate to candidates already nominated by other national 
groups appearing in documents A/69/230, A/69/253 and 
A/69/254: Mohamed Bennouna (Morocco) has also been 
nominated  by  the  national  group  of  Belgium;  Susana 
Ruiz  Cerutti  (Argentina)  has  also  been  nominated  by 
the national groups of Belgium, the Czech Republic and 
Croatia;  James  Richard  Crawford  (Australia)  has  also 
been nominated by the national groups of Belgium, the 
Czech Republic and Romania; and Joan E. Donoghue 
(United States of America) has also been nominated by 
the national groups of Belgium, the Czech Republic and 
Lithuania.
I  should  also  like  to  draw  the  attention  of  the 
Assembly  to  a  note  verbale  from  the  Permanent 
Mission of Mauritania to the United Nations informing 
me of the decision by the national group of Mauritania 
to  withdraw  its  nomination  of  Mr.  Jemal  Agatt  as  a 
candidate.
This  election  will  be  held  in  accordance  with  the 
Statute of the Court, in particular Articles 2 to 4 and 
7 to 12, as well as rules 150 and 151 of the Assembly’s 
rules of procedure.
I should like to confirm that at this time the General 
Assembly  and  the  Security  Council  will  proceed, 
independently  of  one  another,  to  elect  five  members 
of  the  Court  to  fill  the  vacancies  in  accordance  with 
article  8  of  the  Statute.  According  to  Article  2  of 
This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches 
delivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. 
They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member 
of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 
(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official 
Document System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).

the  Statute,  members  of  the  Court  are  to  be  elected, 
regardless of their nationality, from among persons of 
high  moral  character  who  possess  the  qualifications 
required in their respective countries for appointment 
to  the  highest  judicial  offices,  or  are  jurisconsults  of 
recognized  competence  in  international  law.  Article 
9  requires  electors  to  bear  in  mind  not  only  that  the 
person  to  be  elected  should  individually  possess  the 
qualifications required, but also that in the body as a 
whole, representation of the main forms of civilization 
and of the principal legal systems of the world should 
be assured.
In accordance with Article 10, paragraph 1, of the 
Statute  of  the  Court,  those  candidates  who  obtain  an 
absolute majority of votes both in the General Assembly 
and  in  the  Security  Council  shall  be  considered  as 
elected. The consistent practice of the United Nations 
has been to interpret the words “absolute majority” as 
meaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they 
vote or are allowed to vote. The electors in the General 
Assembly are all 193 Member States. Accordingly, for 
the purposes of the present election, 97 votes constitute 
an absolute majority in the General Assembly.
Only those candidates whose names appear on the 
ballot  papers  are  eligible  for  election.  The  electors  in 
the General Assembly will indicate the candidates for 
whom they wish to vote by placing crosses against their 
names on the ballot papers. Each elector may vote for 
not  more  than  five  candidates  on  the  first  ballot  and, 
on subsequent ballots, if any, for five candidates, less 
the  number  of  candidates  who  have  already  obtained 
absolute majorities.
At  the  915th  plenary  meeting  of  the  General 
Assembly, on 16 November 1960, a procedural discussion 
was held as to whether rule 94 — then rule 96 — of the 
rules of procedure of the Assembly should be applied 
in elections to the International Court of Justice. That 
rule lays down a procedure for restricted ballots in the 
event  that,  after  the  first  ballot,  the  requisite  number 
of candidates have not obtained the required majority. 
By  47  votes  to  27,  with  25  abstentions,  the  Assembly 
decided that the rule did not apply to elections to the 
Court  and  proceeded  to  elect  the  requisite  number  of 
candidates  by  a  series  of  unrestricted  ballots.  That 
decision has been followed consistently.
Accordingly,  pursuant  to  rule  151  of  the  rules  of 
procedure of the Assembly, if in the first ballot in the 
General Assembly the number of candidates obtaining 
an absolute majority is less than five, a second ballot 
will be held on the remaining candidates and balloting 
will continue at the same meeting until five candidates 
have obtained the required majority. However, if in the 
first  or  subsequent  ballots  more  than  five  candidates 
obtain an absolute majority, the General Assembly shall 
follow  the  established  practice  and  proceed  to  a  new 
vote on all the candidates. Balloting will continue in the 
same manner until five of the candidates have obtained 
the required majority. Only when five candidates have 
obtained the required majority in the Assembly will the 
President  of  the  Assembly  notify  the  President  of  the 
Security Council of the names of the five candidates.
In  accordance  with  Article  11  of  the  Statute,  if 
upon comparison of the respective lists of names that 
have  obtained  an  absolute  majority  in  the  General 
Assembly and in the Security Council fewer than five 
candidates  have  been  thus  elected,  the  Assembly  and 
the  Council  will  proceed,  again  independently  of  one 
another,  at  a  second  meeting  —  and,  if  necessary,  a 
third — to elect candidates by further ballots for seats 
remaining  vacant,  the  results  again  being  compared 
after the required number of candidates have obtained 
an absolute majority in each organ.
If,  however,  after  the  third  meeting  one  or  more 
seats still remain unfilled, the General Assembly and 
the  Security  Council  may  at  any  time,  at  the  request 
of  either  organ,  form  a  joint  conference  consisting  of 
six members, three appointed by each organ. That joint 
conference may, by an absolute majority, agree on one 
name  for  each  seat  still  vacant  and  submit  the  name 
or  names  for  the  acceptance  of  the  Assembly  and  the 
Council. If the joint conference is unanimously agreed, 
it may submit the name of a person not included in the 
list of nominations, provided that candidate fulfils the 
required  conditions,  in  accordance  with  Article  12, 
paragraph 2, of the Statute.
If the joint conference is satisfied that it will not be 
successful in procuring an election, those members of 
the Court who have already been elected shall, within 
a period to be fixed by the Security Council, proceed 
to fill the vacant seat or seats by selection from among 
those  candidates  who  have  obtained  votes  either  in 
the  General  Assembly  or  in  the  Security  Council.  In 
accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 12 of the 
Statute, in the event of an equality of votes among the 
judges, the eldest shall have a casting vote.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to 
those procedures at this election?

“After 
the  President  has  announced 
the 
beginning  of  voting,  no  representative  shall 
interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a  point  of  order  in 
connection with the actual conduct of the voting”.
including 
Any  announcements, 
those  concerning 
withdrawals of candidatures, should therefore be made 
prior to the commencement of the voting process, that 
is to say, before the announcement of the beginning of 
the voting process.
I  should  like  to  seek  the  usual  cooperation  of 
representatives  during  the  time  of  the  conduct  of  the 
election.  Please  be  reminded  that  during  the  voting 
process  all  campaigning  should  cease  in  the  General 
Assembly Hall. That means in particular that once the 
election  has  begun,  no  more  campaign  material  can 
be  distributed  inside  the  Hall.  All  representatives  are 
also requested to remain at their seats so that the voting 
process  can  proceed  in  an  orderly  manner.  I  thank 
members for their cooperation.
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Ballot 
papers will now be distributed.
to 
Ballot  papers  will  be  given  only 
the 
representatives  seated  directly  behind  country  name 
plates.  Representatives  are  requested  to  use  only 
the  ballot  papers  now  being  distributed.  Only  those 
candidates  whose  names  appear  on  the  ballot  papers 
are  eligible.  Representatives  will  indicate  the  five 
candidates  for  whom  they  wish  to  vote  by  placing 
crosses to the left of their names on the ballot papers. 
Ballot  papers  on  which  more  than  five  names  are 
marked will be considered invalid. Votes may be cast 
only for those whose names appear on the ballot papers.

say  that  Ms.  Eugénie  Liliane  Arivony  of  Madagascar 
has withdrawn her candidacy. I would also like to take 
this opportunity to extend my warm and sincere thanks 
to  all  those  who  have  supported  Madagascar  in  these 
elections.

I propose that the meeting be suspended until 3 p.m., at

Court of Justice. Members will recall that in the ballot 
completed  prior  to  the  suspension  of  the  meeting 
more 
than  five  candidates  obtained  an  absolute 
majority.  Members  will  further  recall  that,  also  prior 
to the suspension of the meeting, the representative of 
Madagascar  informed  the  Assembly,  on  behalf  of  the 
national group of Madagascar, that Ms. Eugénie Liliane 
Arivony had withdrawn her candidacy. She is therefore 
no  longer  a  candidate  and  her  name  has  been  deleted 
from the ballot papers.
I now call on the representative of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo.
Mr.  Tunda  ya  Kasende  (Democratic  Republic 
of  the  Congo)  (spoke  in  French):  On  behalf  of  my 
country,  and  out  of  respect  for  the  rules  at  this  stage 
of the game, in agreement with our national group and 
after consulting Mr. Bula-Bula, I would like to say that 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo has decided to 
withdraw  Mr.  Bula-Bula’s  candidacy.  I  would  like  to 
thank all the States that have supported us, and to wish 
all the remaining candidates in the election the best of 
luck.
The  Acting  President:  Members  have  heard  the 
statement  by  the  representative  of  the  Democratic 
Republic  of  the  Congo  on  behalf  of  that  country’s 
national group to the effect that Mr. Sayeman Bula-Bula 
no longer wishes to be considered as a candidate. Taking 
that  into  consideration,  we  shall  therefore  proceed  to 
the  next  unrestricted  ballot,  and  Mr.  Sayeman  Bula-
Bula’s name will be deleted from the ballot papers.
We shall now proceed to another unrestricted ballot 
to fill the remaining five vacancies.
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Ballot 
papers will now be distributed.
All the candidates whose names appear on the ballot

3 November 1999, and in accordance with the decision 
taken at the beginning of this meeting, a new ballot will 
be held until only the required number of candidates, 
and  no  more,  obtain  an  absolute  majority.  We  shall 
therefore proceed to another unrestricted ballot to fill 
the remaining five vacancies.
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Ballot 
papers will now be distributed.
All  the  candidates  whose  names  appear  on  the 
ballot  papers  are  eligible.  I  would  like  to  remind 
delegations once again that the names of no more than 
five  candidates  should  be  marked  with  a  cross.  Any 
ballot paper on which more than five names are marked 
will be considered invalid. Votes may be cast only for 
those whose names appear on the ballot papers.

I have communicated the result of the voting to the 
President of the Security Council.
I have also received a letter from the President of 
the Security Council, which reads:
“I  have  the  honour  to  inform  you  at  that  at 
the  7297th  meeting  of  the  Security  Council,  held 
on  6  November  2014,  for  the  purpose  of  electing 
five members of the International Court of Justice 
for  a  term  of  office  beginning  on  6  February 
2015,  Mr.  Mohamed  Bennouna,  Ms.  Susana  Ruiz 
Cerutti, Mr. James Richard Crawford, Ms. Joan E. 
Donoghue  and  Mr.  Kirill  Gevorgian  obtained  an 
absolute majority of votes.”
As a result of the independent voting in the General 
Assembly  and  in  the  Security  Council,  the  following 
four candidates have obtained an absolute majority in 
both  bodies:  Mr.  James  Richard  Crawford,  Ms.  Joan 
E. Donoghue, Mr. Kirill Gevorgian and Mr. Mohamed 
Bennouna.  They  are  therefore  duly  elected  members 
of  the  International  Court  of  Justice  to  serve  for  a 
nine-year  term  commencing  on  6  February  2015.  I 
would like to take this opportunity to extend to them 
the congratulations of the Assembly on their election.
In accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of 
the  Statute  of  the  Court,  it  will  be  necessary  to  hold 
another meeting to fill the remaining vacancy.
I propose that the present meeting be adjourned and 
that in view of the late hour, the 40th plenary meeting 
be held tomorrow morning at 10 o’clock to vote on the 
remaining vacancy.
The meeting rose at 6.20 p.m.
