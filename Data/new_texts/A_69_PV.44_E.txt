The  Acting  President:  As  members  are  aware, 
there is still one vacancy on the Court to be filled. The 
Assembly will now proceed to vote with respect to the

I should like once again to remind representatives 
“After 
that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure,
the  President  has  announced 
the 
beginning  of  voting,  no  representative  shall 
interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a  point  of  order  in 
connection with the actual conduct of the voting.”
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Ballot 
papers will now be distributed.
All the candidates whose names appear on the ballot 
paper  are  eligible.  I  would  like  to  remind  delegations 
that the name of only one candidate should be marked 
with a cross. Any ballot paper on which more than one 
the 
invitation  of 
name is marked will be considered invalid. Votes may 
be cast only for those whose names appear on the ballot 
papers.

I have also received a letter from the President of 
the Security Council, which reads:
“I  have  the  honour  to  inform  you  that  at  the 
7302nd  meeting  of  the  Security  Council,  held  on 
7 November 2014, for the purpose of electing one 
member  of  the  International  Court  of  Justice  for 
a  term  of  office  beginning  on  6  February  2015, 
Ms.  Susana  Ruiz  Cerutti  obtained  an  absolute 
majority of votes.”
As  a  result  of  the  voting  that  has  taken  place 
the 
independently  in  the  General  Assembly  and 
Security  Council,  no  candidate  has  obtained  an 
absolute  majority  in  both  bodies.  In  accordance  with 
the provisions of Article 11 of the Statute of the Court, 
it will therefore be necessary to hold another meeting to 
fill the remaining vacancy.
I  propose  that  the  present  meeting  be  adjourned 
and the 45th meeting held immediately to vote on the 
remaining vacancy.
The meeting rose at 4.30 p.m.
