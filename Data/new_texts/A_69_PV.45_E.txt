The President: As members are aware, there is still 
one vacancy on the Court to be filled. The Assembly 
will now proceed to vote with respect to the remaining 
vacancy.
I should like once again to remind representatives 
“After 
that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure,
the  President  has  announced 
the 
beginning  of  voting,  no  representative  shall 
interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a  point  of  order  in 
connection with the actual conduct of the voting.”
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Ballot 
papers will now be distributed.
All the candidates whose names appear on the ballot 
paper  are  eligible.  I  would  like  to  remind  delegations 
that the name of only one candidate should be marked 
with a cross. Any ballot paper on which more than one 
name is marked will be considered invalid. Votes may 
be cast only for those whose names appear on the ballot 
papers.
At  the  invitation  of  the  President,  Ms.  Mansouri 
(Algeria),  Ms.  Mohd  Salleh  (Brunei  Darussalam), 
Mr.  Ona  Garcés  (Ecuador),  Mr.  Madut  (South 
Sudan), Ms. Lyngdorf (Sweden) and Mr. do Carmo 
Vieira (Timor-Leste) acted as tellers.
A vote was taken by secret ballot.
The  meeting  was  suspended  at  4.40  p.m.  and 
resumed at 5 p.m.
The  President:  The  result  of  the  voting  is  as 
follows:

Mr.  Patrick  Lipton  Robinson  has  obtained  an 
absolute majority in the General Assembly.
I have communicated the result of the voting to the 
President of the Security Council.
I have also received a letter from the President of 
the Security Council, which reads:
“I  have  the  honour  to  inform  you  that  at  the 
7303rd  meeting  of  the  Security  Council,  held  on 
7 November 2014, for the purpose of electing one 
member  of  the  International  Court  of  Justice  for

a  term  of  office  beginning  on  6  February  2015, 
Ms.  Susana  Ruiz  Cerutti  obtained  an  absolute 
majority of votes.”
As  a  result  of  the  voting  that  has  taken  place 
independently  in  the  General  Assembly  and 
the 
Security  Council,  no  candidate  has  obtained  an 
absolute  majority  in  both  bodies.  In  accordance  with 
the provisions of Article 11 of the Statute of the Court, 
it will therefore be necessary to hold another meeting to 
fill the remaining vacancy.
I  propose  that  the  present  meeting  be  adjourned 
and the 46th meeting held immediately to vote on the 
remaining vacancy.
The meeting rose at 5.05 p.m.
