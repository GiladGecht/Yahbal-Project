Agenda item 112 (continued)
Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs
(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic 
and Social Council
The  President:  The  General  Assembly  will  now 
proceed to the election of 18 members of the Economic 
and  Social  Council  to  replace  those  members  whose 
term of office expires on 31 December 2015.
The 18 outgoing members are: Albania, Australia, 
Benin,  the  Plurinational  State  of  Bolivia,  Colombia, 
Croatia,  Haiti,  Italy,  Kuwait,  Kyrgyzstan,  Mauritius, 
Nepal, San Marino, South Africa, the Sudan, Tunisia, 
Turkmenistan  and  the  United  States  of  America. 
Pursuant  to  rule  146  of  the  rules  of  procedure,  these 
countries are eligible for immediate re-election.
As  of  1  January  2016,  the  following  States  will 
be  represented  on  the  Economic  and  Social  Council: 
Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Austria, Bangladesh, 
Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, China, the Congo, the 
Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo,  Estonia,  Finland, 
France, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, 
Honduras,  India,  Japan,  Kazakhstan,  Mauritania, 
Pakistan, Panama, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, the 
Russian Federation, Serbia, Sweden, Switzerland, Togo, 
Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Zimbabwe. The 
names of these 36 States should therefore not appear on 
the ballots.
In accordance with paragraph 4 of resolution 2847 
(XXVI), of 20 December 1971, and taking into account 
the number of States that will remain members of the 
Council after 1 January 2016, the 18 members should be 
elected as follows: five from African States, four from 
Asia-Pacific States, two from Eastern European States, 
three  from  Latin  American  and  Caribbean  States  and 
four  from  Western  European  and  other  States.  The 
ballot papers reflect that pattern.
I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that  those 
candidates — their number not exceeding the number 
of seats to be filled — that receive a two-thirds majority 
and the greatest number of votes by members present 
and  voting,  will  be  declared  elected.  Consistent  with 
past practice, in the case of a tie vote making it necessary 
to  determine  the  candidate  to  be  elected  or  that  will 
proceed to the next round of restricted balloting, there 
will  be  a  special  restricted  ballot  limited  to  those 
candidates that have obtained an equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to 
these procedures?
It was so decided.
The President: In accordance with rule 92 of the 
rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret 
ballot, and there shall be no nominations.
Regarding candidatures of the respective regional 
Groups, the Secretariat has been informed that for the 
five  vacant  seats  from  among  the  African  States,  the 
Group has endorsed five candidates: Algeria, Nigeria, 
Rwanda, Somalia and South Africa. For the four vacant

seats from among the Asia-Pacific States, the Group has 
endorsed four candidates: Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon 
and  Viet  Nam.  For  the  two  vacant  seats  from  among 
the  Eastern  European  States,  the  Group  has  endorsed 
two  candidates:  the  Czech  Republic  and  the  Republic 
of Moldova. For the three vacant seats from among the 
Latin  American  and  Caribbean  States,  the  Group  has 
endorsed  three  candidates:  Chile,  Guyana  and  Peru. 
For  the  four  vacant  seats  from  among  the  Western 
European and other States, the Group has endorsed four 
candidates:  Australia,  Belgium,  Italy  and  the  United 
States of America.
In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, 
we shall now proceed to the election by secret ballot.
Before we begin the voting process, I should like to 
remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of 
procedure of the General Assembly, no representative 
shall  interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a  point  of  order 
on the actual conduct of the voting. In addition, ballot 
papers will be given only to the representative seated 
directly behind the country’s name plate.
I  should  like  to  seek  the  usual  cooperation  of 
representatives  during  the  time  of  the  conduct  of  the 
election.  Please  be  reminded  that  during  the  voting 
process,  all  campaigning  should  cease  in  the  General 
Assembly Hall. This means in particular that once the 
meeting  has  begun,  no  more  campaign  material  can 
be distributed inside the Hall. All delegations are also 
requested  to  remain  at  their  seats  so  that  the  voting 
process can proceed in an orderly manner. I thank the 
delegations for their cooperation.
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Ballot 
papers  marked  “A”,  “B”,  “C”,  “D”  and  “E”  will  now 
be  distributed.  I  request  representatives  to  use  only 
those ballot papers and to write on them the names of 
the States for which they wish to vote. A ballot will be 
declared invalid if it contains more names of Member 
States from the relevant region than the number of seats 
assigned to it. A ballot will also be declared invalid if 
none of the names of the Member States on that ballot 
belongs  to  the  relevant  region.  If  a  ballot  paper  of  a 
region contains both the names of Member States that 
belong  to  and  that  are  outside  that  region,  the  ballot 
remains valid but only the names of the Member States 
that belong to the relevant region will be counted. The 
names  of  Member  States  that  do  not  belong  to  that 
region will not be counted.
At  the  invitation  of  the  President,  Mrs.  Vassil  (El 
Salvador), Ms. Jeske (Germany), Mrs. Bowoleksono 
(Indonesia),  Mr.  Miró  Weeden 
(Panama), 
Ms.  Magnon  (Togo)  and  Mr.  Varganov  (Russian 
Federation) acted as tellers.
A vote was taken by secret ballot.

resumed at 11.40 a.m.
