The Acting President: The Assembly will proceed 
to  the  election  of  the  members  of  the  International 
Law Commission.
In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  chapter  I  of 
the statute of the Commission, the 34 members of the 
Commission are to be elected by the General Assembly 
for a five-year term of office beginning on 1 January 
2017  from  a  list  of  candidates  nominated  by  the 
Governments of States Members of the United Nations.
The  members  of  the  Commission  are  eligible  for 
re-election. The present membership of the Commission 
is set out in the annex to document A/71/90. The notes 
Members  will  recall  that  the  Assembly,  at  its 
25th  plenary  meeting,  on  6  October  2016,  decided  to 
request that the Secretary-General issue a consolidated 
list,  incorporating  new  candidates  and  additional 
information  on  candidates  received  subsequent  to  the 
deadline  for  the  submission  of  nominations.  In  that 
connection,  the  Assembly  now  has  before  it  the  note 
by  the  Secretary-General  circulated  as  document 
A/71/437  and  its  corrigendum  1,  which  consolidates, 
in  alphabetical  order,  the  candidates  nominated  by 
Governments of States Members of the United Nations 
for election to the International Law Commission.
I  should  like  to  inform  the  Assembly  that,  as 
indicated  in  document  A/71/90/Add.6,  the  Permanent 
Mission  of  Libya  to  the  United  Nations  indicated, 
in  a  note  verbale  dated  27  October  2016,  that  it  had 
withdrawn  the  candidature  of  Mr.  Abdelrazeg  el-
Murtadi  Suleiman  Gouider  to  the  International  Law 
Commission. In addition, the Permanent Mission of the 
Sudan to the United Nations informed the Secretariat, 
in  a  note  verbale  dated  1  November  2016,  of  the 
withdrawal of Mr. Muaz Ahmed Tungo for election to 
the International Law Commission; and the Permanent 
Mission  of  Burundi  to  the  United  Nations,  in  a  note 
verbale dated 2 November 2016, informed the Secretariat 
of  the  withdrawal  of  Mr.  Révérien  Habarugira  for 
election to the International Law Commission. A total 
of 46 candidates are therefore eligible in this election.

The notes by the Secretary-General concerning the 
statements of qualifications of candidates are contained 
in documents A/71/83 and its addendum 1.
I  should  like  to  recall  for  members  that,  in 
accordance  with  the  statute  of  the  International  Law 
Commission, 
the  Commission  should  consist  of 
persons of recognized competence in international law; 
the  persons  to  be  elected  to  the  Commission  should 
individually possess the qualifications required; and in 
the Commission as a whole, representation of the main 
forms of civilization and of the principal legal systems 
of the world should be ensured.
Pursuant  to  paragraph  3  of  resolution  36/39,  of 
18 November 1981, the 34 members should be elected 
as follows: eight nationals from African States; seven 
nationals from Asia-Pacific States; four nationals from 
Eastern  European  States;  seven  nationals  from  Latin 
American  and  Caribbean  States;  and  eight  nationals 
from  Western  European  and  other  States.  The  ballot 
papers reflect that pattern.
As provided for in the statute of the International 
Law Commission, those candidates, up to the maximum 
number  prescribed  for  each  regional  group,  receiving 
the greatest number of votes and not less than a majority 
of the votes of the Member States present and voting, 
shall be declared elected.
If  the  number  of  candidates  obtaining  a  simple 
majority  is  less  than  the  number  of  members  to  be 
elected,  there  shall  be  additional  ballots  to  fill  the 
remaining  places,  the  voting  being  restricted  to  the 
candidates  obtaining  the  greatest  number  of  votes  in 
the previous ballot to a number not more than twice the 
places remaining to be filled.
Also, consistent with past practice, if, in the case 
of  a  tie  vote,  it  becomes  necessary  to  determine  the 
candidate to be elected or to proceed to the next round 
of restricted balloting, there will be a special restricted 
ballot limited to the candidates who have obtained an 
equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to 
these procedures?
It was so decided.
The Acting President: In accordance with rule 92 
of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, the 
election shall be held by secret ballot. Before we begin 
the  voting  process,  I  should  like  to  remind  members 
that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure of the 
General Assembly, no representative shall interrupt the 
voting except on a point of order on the actual conduct 
of the voting. In addition, ballot papers will be given 
only  to  the  representative  seated  directly  behind  the 
country’s nameplate.
I  would  like  to  seek  the  usual  cooperation  of 
representatives  during  the  time  of  the  conduct  of  the 
election  and  to  remind  them  that  during  the  voting 
process,  all  campaigning  should  cease  in  the  General 
Assembly Hall. That means, in particular, that once the 
meeting has begun, no more campaign material may be 
distributed inside the Hall.
All representatives are also requested to remain at 
their seats so that the voting process can proceed in an 
orderly manner. I thank them for their cooperation.
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Members 
are  requested  to  remain  seated  until  all  ballots  have 
been collected.
Ballot papers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E” 
will now be distributed. Representatives are requested to 
use only those ballot papers that have been distributed. 
Each ballot paper contains the names of the candidates 
eligible in this round of balloting.
Representatives  are  requested  to  place  a  cross  to 
the left of the names of the candidates for whom they 
wish to vote. Representatives may vote only for those 
candidates  whose  names  appear  on  the  ballot  papers, 
and for no more than the number of seats allocated to 
each region. A ballot paper containing more votes than 
the number of seats allocated to the relevant region will 
be declared invalid.
Accordingly, members should ensure that the ballot 
papers  marked  “A”  for  African  States  do  not  contain 
votes  for  more  than  eight  candidates;  that  the  ballot 
papers  marked  “B”  for  Asia-Pacific  States  do  not 
contain votes for more than seven candidates; that the 
ballot papers marked “C” for Eastern European States 
do not contain votes for more than four candidates; that 
the ballot papers marked “D” for Latin American and 
Caribbean  States  do  not  contain  votes  for  more  than 
seven candidates; and that the ballot papers marked “E” 
for Western European and other States do not contain 
votes for more than eight candidates.
