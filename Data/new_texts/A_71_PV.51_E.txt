Reports of the First Committee
The  Acting  President:  The  General  Assembly 
will now take up the reports of the First Committee on 
agenda items 89 to 105, 121 and 135.
I now request the Rapporteur of the First Committee, 
Mr. Darren Hansen of Australia, to introduce the reports 
of the First Committee in one intervention.
Mr.  Hansen  (Australia):  I  have  the  honour  to 
introduce  to  the  General  Assembly  the  reports  of  the 
Disarmament  and  International  Security  Committee, 
the First Committee, on agenda items 89 to 105, 121 and 
135, as contained in documents A/71/441 to A/71/459. 
For the convenience of delegations, a checklist prepared 
by the Secretariat specifying the action taken in the First 
Committee is contained in document A/C.1/71/INF/3.
During this main part of the seventy-first session, 
the Disarmament and International Security Committee 
held  a  total  of  26  formal  meetings  so  as  to  consider 
the  20  agenda  items  that  were  allocated  to  it.  During 
the  session,  118  delegations  made  statements  within 
the  general  debate  segment,  while  an  impressive  302 
interventions were made during the thematic discussion 
segment.  That  can  be  compared  with  112  delegations 
and  273  statements  in  2015.  During  the  action  phase, 
the  Committee  adopted  69  draft  resolutions  and 
decisions, 35 of which were adopted by recorded vote

was put forward in the Committee.
The  proposals  considered  under  agenda  items  90, 
91, 92, 94, 97, 100, 102, 103 and 105 were all adopted 
without  a  vote.  Oral  statements  by  the  Secretariat 
were  made  prior  to  the  adoption  of  draft  resolution 
A/C.1/71/L.4,  entitled  “Convention  on  Prohibitions 
or  Restrictions  on  the  Use  of  Certain  Conventional 
Weapons  Which  May  Be  Deemed  to  Be  Excessively 
Injurious  or 
Indiscriminate  Effects”, 
submitted under agenda item 102; and draft resolution 
A/C.1/71/L.56, entitled “Convention on the Prohibition

Of  the  eight  proposals  considered  under  agenda 
item 99, “Review and implementation of the Concluding 
Document of the Twelfth Special Session of the General

96,  98,  99  (c),  101  and  104.  Since  the  issuance  of  the 
report  of  the  First  Committee  on  agenda  item  101, 
entitled “The risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle 
East”  (A/71/453),  the  Secretariat  has  been  informed 
that the Comoros had intended to vote in favour of draft 
resolution A/C.1/71/L.2/Rev.1 as a whole.
Agenda  item  98,  entitled  “General  and  complete 
disarmament”,  accounted  for  25  of  the  29  separate 
votes, 6 of the 11 oral statements made by the Secretariat 
and the two programme-budget implications issued for 
the session.
With regard to item 121, “Revitalization of the work 
of the General Assembly”, the draft decision containing 
the  provisional  programme  of  work  and  timetable  of 
the First Committee for 2017 is contained in document 
A/71/458.
As  indicated  in  the  report  of  the  Committee  in 
document  A/71/459,  the  need  did  not  arise  for  the 
Committee to take up item 135, “Programme planning”.
I have the honour to submit to the General Assembly 
for its consideration and adoption the draft resolutions 
and draft decisions recommended by the Disarmament 
and  International  Security  Committee  in  its  reports 
contained in documents A/71/441 to A/71/459.
Before concluding, I would like to recall the high 
level of cooperation prevailing in the First Committee. 
The Committee was able to fulfil the mandate entrusted 
to it by the Assembly and to complete its work within the 
time allotted by the Assembly. I should like to express, 
on behalf of the Bureau of the Committee, our sincere 
appreciation  to  all  delegations  for  their  constructive 
participation during the session. In that regard, I would 
like to note in particular the positive manner in which 
the  new  e-delegate  and  e-cosponsorship  tools  were 
embraced by delegations.
I  should  like  to  pay  particular  tribute  here  to 
the  Chair  of  the  First  Committee,  His  Excellency 
Ambassador Boukadoum of Algeria, whose knowledge 
and experience in multilateral forums, enhanced by his 
consummate diplomatic skills, enabled the Committee 
to consider in depth all of the agenda items allocated to 
it. The other members of the Bureau, Mr. Rene Zeleny 
of  the  Czech  Republic,  Ms.  María  Soledad  Urruela 
Arenales of Guatemala, and Mr. Kamapradipta Isnomo 
of Indonesia, with whom I had the pleasure of working, 
also contributed greatly to the successful conclusion of 
the work of the Committee.
Finally,  I  would  like  to  recognize  the  dedicated 
support of Mr. Kim Won-soo, High Representative for 
Disarmament  Affairs,  and  the  staff  of  the  Office  of 
Disarmament  Affairs,  as  well  as  the  Secretary  of  the 
Committee, Ms. Sonia Elliott, and her team: conference 
officers,  interpreters,  record  keepers,  press  officers, 
documents officers, sound technicians and information 
technology staff.
The Acting President: If there is no proposal under 
rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the 
General Assembly decides not to discuss the reports of 
the First Committee that are before the Assembly today.
It was so decided.
The  Acting  President:  Statements  will  therefore 
be limited to explanations of vote.
The  positions  of  delegations 
the 
recommendations  of  the  First  Committee  have  been 
made clear in the Committee and are reflected in the 
relevant official documents.
regarding 
Before  we  begin 
May  I  remind  members  that,  in  accordance  with 
General Assembly decision 34/401, a delegation should, 
as  far  as  possible,  explain  its  vote  only  once,  that  is, 
either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, unless 
that delegation’s vote in the plenary meeting is different 
from its vote in the Committee, and that the explanations 
of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by 
delegations from their seats.
to 
the 
recommendations contained in the reports of the First 
Committee, I should like to advise representatives that 
we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same 
manner as was done in the Committee, unless notified 
otherwise in advance. That means that where separate 
or  recorded  votes  were  taken,  we  will  do  the  same.  I 
also hope that we may proceed to adopt without a vote 
those  recommendations  that  were  adopted  without  a 
vote in the First Committee.
take  action  on 
Before proceeding further, I would like to draw the 
attention of Member States to a note by the Secretariat, 
in English only, entitled “Situation reports of the First 
Committee  on  agenda  items  89  to  105,  121  and  135”, 
which has been circulated as document A/C.1/71/INF/3. 
The note has been distributed desk to desk in the Hall 
to be held as a reference guide for action on the draft 
resolutions and the decisions recommended by the First 
Committee in its reports. In that connection, members 
will find in the second column of the note the symbols 
2/48 
16-41339
05/12/2016 
A/71/PV.51
of  the  draft  resolutions  and  decisions  of  the  First 
Committee,  with  the  corresponding  symbols  of  the 
report for action in the plenary in the fourth column. 
For reports containing multiple recommendations, the 
draft resolution or decision number is contained in the 
fifth column of the note.
Furthermore, members are reminded that additional 
sponsors  are  no  longer  accepted  now  that  the  draft 
resolutions  and  decisions  have  been  adopted  by  the 
Committee. Any clarification about sponsorship in the 
Committee reports should be addressed to the Secretary 
of the Committee.
Moreover,  Member  States  are  reminded  that  any 
corrections to the voting intentions of delegations, after 
the voting has concluded on the proposal, should be made 
directly to the Secretariat after the meeting in writing. 
In that regard, I would seek members’ cooperation in 
avoiding any interruptions to our proceedings.

Draft  decision  III  was  adopted  by  179  votes  to 
none, with 5 abstentions (decision 71/517).
The  Acting  President:  I  shall  now  call  on  those 
representatives  who  wish  to  speak  in  explanation  of 
vote or position on the resolutions just adopted.
Ms.  Dagher  (Lebanon)  (spoke  in  Arabic):  My 
delegation would like to explain its vote on resolution 
71/69,  entitled  “Implementation  of  the  Convention 
on  the  Prohibition  of  the  Development,  Production, 
Stockpiling  and  Use  of  Chemical  Weapons  and  on 
Their Destruction”.
Lebanon  would  first  like  to  say  that  we  are  fully 
committed to the principal objective of the Convention, 
to which Lebanon is a signatory. We have expressed our 
opinion on it many times, because the use of chemical 
weapons is a violation of international law. However, in 
view of the wording of the resolution — particularly with 
regard to the crisis in Syria and especially in paragraph 
2  —  and  based  on  our  policy  of  distancing  ourselves 
from any intervention in that crisis, we abstained in the 
voting, despite our support for the resolution’s aims and 
our  commitment  and  conviction  that  the  Convention 
should  be  fully  implemented  and  that  we  should 
cooperate internationally in its framework.
Mr.  Ammar  (Pakistan):  I  am  taking  the  floor 
to  explain  my  delegation’s  vote  on  resolution  71/67, 
“Nuclear disarmament verification”. Pakistan remains 
committed  to  achieving  a  nuclear-weapon-free  world 
through  the  conclusion  of  a  universal,  verifiable  and 
non-discriminatory  comprehensive  convention  on 
nuclear  weapons.  We  support  the  commencement 
of  negotiations  to  that  end  in  the  Conference  on 
Disarmament.
We  recognize  that  the  process  of  multilateral 
nuclear  disarmament  involving  the  reduction  and 
elimination  of  nuclear  weapons  would  be  a  complex 
undertaking, and that verification would be an essential 
and  key  component  of  such  a  process,  the  credibility 
of  which  would  rest  to  a  large  degree  on  an  effective 
and independent verification mechanism, to be agreed 
on  during  the  negotiations.  The  negotiations  for  a 
comprehensive  nuclear-weapon  convention  should 
be  undertaken  holistically,  not  pursued  piecemeal. 
Nonetheless,  we  see  the  value  in  doing  some  expert 
work  on  the  issue  of  verification  in  a  representative 
forum that includes all the relevant stakeholders.
In our view, the most suitable forum for that work 
would  be  the  Conference  on  Disarmament.  Its  rules 
of  procedure  and  past  precedent  would  enable  the 
creation  of  a  subsidiary  body  for  this  purpose.  We 
gave the sponsors of resolution 71/67 an amendment to 
that  effect;  however,  they  chose  to  task  a  25-member 
group of governmental experts, not the Conference on 
Disarmament, to do the work. In a demonstration of our 
flexibility and desire to contribute to the process, my 
delegation decided to vote in favour of the resolution. 
We did so in a spirit of constructive engagement that we 
hope will help to make a practical contribution to the 
cause of nuclear disarmament. In that context, we hope 
to be part of the group of governmental experts to be 
established pursuant to the resolution.
Mr.  Mahfouz  (Egypt):  Egypt  is  taking  the  floor 
to  explain  its  vote  on  resolution  71/50,  on  the  Arms 
Trade Treaty.
As  a  matter  of  fundamental  policy,  Egypt  is 
well  aware  of  the  facts  of  the  illicit  trafficking  in 
weapons.  We  are  fully  committed  to  exerting  every 
effort to combat and eradicate the illicit trade in arms. 
Nevertheless, Egypt abstained in the voting on the draft 
resolution  entitled  “The  Arms  Trade  Treaty”,  for  we 
are  of  the  view  that  the  Treaty  cannot  be  considered 
universal or inclusive. We therefore do not accept the 
text  contained  in  paragraph  3,  on  which  we  already 
voiced reservations in consultations. In fact, the United 
Nations  Conference  on  the  Arms  Trade  Treaty  was 
unable  to  achieve  consensus.  Egypt  regrets  that  the 
final Conference was unable to reach agreement on a 
balanced and robust text acceptable to all States.
Egypt  expresses  its  reservation  on  the  principle 
of  adopting  an  important  international  disarmament 
instrument  through  a  vote.  Neglecting  the  consensus

principle  is  a  negative  precedent  that  undermines  the 
basis  upon  which  most  international  agreements  on 
disarmament  have  been  developed.  In  that  context, 
Egypt shares the following concerns.
First,  with  regard  to  the  lack  of  definitions  of 
important  terms  and  concepts  that  are  essential  for 
implementing the Treaty, including “end use” and “end 
user”,  we  stress  that  providing  information  regarding 
“end  use’  and  “end  user”  should  be  consistent  with 
the  laws  and  national  security  requirements  of  the 
receiving party.
Secondly,  another 
important  missing  element 
concerns  the  criteria  by  which  an  exporter  would 
determine  the  application  of  the  Treaty.  In  that 
connection, we believe that the international community 
is meant to rely chiefly on the Register of Conventional 
Arms, which includes only seven categories of weapons, 
excluding small arms and light weapons.
Thirdly,  the  inclusion  of  a  clear  reference  to  the 
crimes of aggression and foreign occupation as part of 
the assessment would have clarified the implementation 
process and resulted in the essence of the Treaty being 
on regulating the arms trade, not restricting it.
Fourthly, Egypt believes that all countries should be 
equally accountable to common benchmarks. Without 
agreed definitions or clear criteria, the implementation 
of the Treaty runs the risk of being subjective. It would 
depend  upon  the  national  political  considerations  of 
exporting States.
The efforts of the international community should 
continue to focus on filling in the remaining gaps that 
the Arms Trade Treaty has left untouched. We continue 
to  call  for  addressing  the  elements  of  overproduction 
and  the  ever-increasing  stockpiles  of  conventional 
weapons within the territories of major arms exporters 
and producers. We still believe that every effort must 
be exerted to bring production and stockpiles in major 
arms-producing  States  under  international  scrutiny. 
International  accountability  is  the  only  guarantee 
against  the  possible  abuse  of  the  existing  imbalance 
between major arms producers and the rest of the world.
further 
developments  regarding  the  implementation  of  the 
Treaty, in order to determine our further position.

Chemical Weapons Convention has evolved in a negative 
manner, focusing in a partial way on certain countries.
That  has  caused  this  resolution  to  lose  the  consensus 
backing  it  enjoyed  for  two  decades.  That  situation 
benefits  no  one;  on  the  contrary,  it  affects  us  all.  My 
delegation has always publicly declared the importance 
Venezuela  attaches 
the  Chemical  Weapons 
Convention.  As  a  State  party  to  the  Convention,  we 
actively participate in the work of the organization, and 
we condemn the development, production, stockpiling 
and use of chemical weapons by whomever, wherever 
and under any circumstance.
to 
At  the  same  time,  we  believe  that  the  full 
implementation of all of the provisions of the Convention 
requires  joint  efforts  on  the  part  of  all  States  parties. 
We have been emphatic in pointing out that the General 
Assembly is not the forum in which to repeat speeches 
and discussions that should take place at The Hague in 
the framework of the Organization for the Prohibition 
of  Chemical  Weapons.  On  the  contrary,  the  General 
Assembly  is  the  forum  in  which  we  should  promote 
and  consolidate  the  unity  of  us  all  in  supporting  the 
Convention.
Political manipulation in this text against a particular 
country does not have any link to the key objective of 
this First Committee resolution, whose raison d’être is 
to promote and strengthen the unity of everyone behind 
the Convention. In previous years, Venezuela has called 
upon the sponsors of the resolution to reconsider the way 
they have been managing the resolution. Unfortunately, 
for the third time in the long history of this important 
resolution,  confrontation  and  politicization  prevail, 
instead of the spirit of cooperation and unity. We call 
on  the  sponsors  to  reconsider  once  more  the  position 
they have been taking.

Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty
Report of the First Committee (A/71/456)
The Acting President: The Assembly has before it 
a draft resolution recommended by the First Committee 
in paragraph 7 of its report.
I now give the floor the representative of Egypt, who 
wishes to speak in explanation of vote before the voting.
Mr.  Mahfouz  (Egypt)  (spoke  in  Arabic):  The 
following  is  an  explanation  of  the  vote  of  the  Arab 
Republic of Egypt on the draft resolution recommended 
by  the  First  Committee  in  paragraph  7  of  its  report  
entitled  “Comprehensive  Nuclear-Test-Ban  Treaty”  
(A/71/456).
Egypt’s commitment to the nuclear disarmament and 
nuclear non-proliferation regime has been unwavering 
over the past decades. Nuclear disarmament has been 
a  top  priority  of  Egyptian  foreign  policy,  in  the  firm 
belief that nuclear weapons constitute a grave danger to 
international peace and security.
My  delegation  will  abstain  in  the  voting  on  the 
fourth  preambular  paragraph  of  the  draft  resolution 
to express our strong objection to the reference within 
that  paragraph  to  the  controversial  Security  Council 
resolution 2310 (2016), given that, substantively, it not 
only falls outside the purview of the Security Council, 
but it is also legally and technically flawed in its relation 
to the nuclear disarmament regime. We regret that such 
a resolution was adopted by the Security Council. 
We  have  six  specific  reservations  with  regard  to 
Security Council resolution 2310 (2016).
First,  the  Security  Council  is  not  the  appropriate 
forum  to  deal  with  the  Treaty,  since  the  preparatory 
committee  for  the  Comprehensive  Nuclear  Test-Ban 
Treaty  Organization  and  its  Provisional  Technical 
Secretariat in Vienna have fully played that role to date. 
Involving the Security Council in the technical aspects 
of  the  Convention  creates  unnecessary  duplication,  a 
parallel track and an unfavourable environment that is 
not universal. 
fails 
Secondly, 
to  highlight 
the 
Non-Proliferation  of  Nuclear  Weapons  with  regard  to 
the nuclear disarmament regime. Surprisingly, it does 
the  draft 
resolution  clearly 
the  centrality  of  Treaty  on 
not refer at all to the need of achieving the univerality 
of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Thirdly,  it  would  have  been  logical  to  treat  not 
only the symptoms, but the disease itself. Addressing 
nuclear  tests  exclusively  in  that  resolution,  without 
mentioning  the  need  for  nuclear  disarmament  and  to 
free the world of those immoral and inhuman weapons 
of  mass  destruction,  in  accordance  with  article  VI 
of  the  Non-Proliferation  Treaty,  not  only  allows  the 
acquisition  of  those  weapons  but  also  prolongs  their 
acquisition  by  the  nuclear-weapon  States,  thereby 
creating  a  situation  that  threatens  international  peace 
and security.
Fourthly,  Security  Council  resolution  2310  (2016) 
is unacceptable and unfair. It places the nuclear-weapon 
States on an equal footing with the non-nuclear-weapon 
States  with  regard  to  the  question  of  accession.  The 
nuclear States and those that are not party to the Treaty 
should always assume a special responsibility. 
Fifthly,  the  resolution  in  its  current  form  and 
language — I refer here to Security Council resolution 
2310  (2016)  —  represents  interference  in  the  work 
of  the  preparatory  committee  Provisional  Technical 
Secretariat  of  the  CTBT  in  Vienna.  Thus,  it  will  not 
only  have  a  counterproductive  impact  on  the  work  in 
Vienna,  but  also  completely  undermine  its  role  if  the 
Security  Council  continues  to  be  involved  with  the 
technical dossier.
Sixthly and lastly, Security Council resolution 2310 
(2016)  reflects  a  puzzling  dilemma,  as  it  feverishly 
supports  the  completion  of  the  verification  regime, 
while  many  major  Powers  shirk  their  obligations  in 
this  context  and  do  not  assume  their  responsibilities 
in ratifying the CTBT on the pretext of their domestic 
policies and legislation.
The Acting President: We will now take a decision 
on the draft resolution.
Separate,  recorded  votes  have  been  requested  on 
the  fourth  and  seventh  preambular  paragraphs  of  the 
draft resolution.
I  shall  first  put  to  the  vote  the  fourth  preambular 
paragraph.

Programme of work
The  Acting  President:  I  would  like  to  draw  the 
attention of members to the date of recess of the current 
session.  Members  will  recall  that,  at  its  2nd  plenary 
meeting,  on  16  September,  the  General  Assembly 
decided that the seventy-first session would recess on 
Monday,  12  December  2016.  However,  in  view  of  the 
work that remains to be completed for this part of the 
session, I would like to propose to the Assembly that it 
postpone the date of recess to Monday, 19 December. 
May  I  take  it  that  the  General  Assembly  agrees  to 
postpone the date of recess to Monday, 19 December 2016?
It was so decided.
The Acting President: I should also like to consult 
members  regarding  an  extension  of  the  work  of  the 
Fifth Committee.
Members will recall that, at its 2nd plenary meeting, 
on 16 September, the General Assembly approved the 
recommendation  of  the  General  Committee  that  the 
Fifth  Committee  would  complete  its  work  by  Friday, 
9 December. However, I have been informed by the Chair 
of the Fifth Committee that the Committee requests an 
extension of its work to Friday, 16 December, as such 
an extension would facilitate reaching consensus on the 
pending draft resolutions before it.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to 
extend  the  work  of  the  Fifth  Committee  until  Friday, 
16 December 2016?
It was so decided.
