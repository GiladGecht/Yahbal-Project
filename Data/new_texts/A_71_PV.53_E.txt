the Under-Secretary-General for Communications and

the  Department  of  Public  Information  to  disseminate 
the  message  of  the  United  Nations  around  the  world. 
The Committee also considered a written statement of

Senior Adviser on Information Management and Policy 
Coordination  of  the  Secretariat  of  the  United  Nations 
System Chief Executives Board for Coordination. 
The  Fourth  Committee  adopted  draft  resolution 
A,  entitled  “Information  in  the  service  of  humanity” 
without a vote. Operative paragraph 23 of draft resolution 
B, entitled “United Nations public information policies

With regard to the cluster of items on the non-self-
governing  territories  and  the  Declaration  on  the 
Granting  of  Independence 
to  Colonial  Countries 
and  Peoples  —  agenda  items  54  to  58  —  the  Fourth 
Committee  considered  those  five  items  together.  The 
Committee  held  a  general  debate  on  those  issues 
and  heard  102  petitioners  on  the  various  non-self-
governing territories, as well as the President of French 
Polynesia, the Chief Minister of Gibraltar and the Vice 
President of the Government of New Caledonia. For the 
consideration of those items, the General Assembly has 
before it the following five reports.
With regard to the report submitted under agenda 
item  54,  entitled  “Information 
from  Non-Self-
Governing  Territories  transmitted  under  paragraph 
Article  73  e  of  the  Charter  of  the  United  Nations”, 
contained in document A/71/498; the report submitted 
under  agenda  item  55,  entitled  “Economic  and  other 
activities  which  affect  the  interests  of  the  peoples  of 
the  Non-Self-Governing  Territories”,  contained  in 
document A/71/499; the report submitted under agenda

Nations”,  contained  in  document  A/71/500;  and  the 
report submitted under agenda item 57, entitled “Offers 
by  Member  States  of  study  and  training  facilities 
for  inhabitants  of  Non-Self-Governing  Territories”, 
contained  in  document  A/71/501,  the  corresponding 
draft resolutions are contained in paragraph 7 of each of 
the relevant reports. The report submitted under agenda 
item 58, entitled “Implementation of the Declaration on 
the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and 
Peoples” is contained in document A/71/502. Under that 
item,  the  Fourth  Committee  adopted  seventeen  draft 
resolutions and a draft decision on issues relating to the 
implementation  of  the  Declaration  and  the  Non-Self-
Governing  Territories,  as  contained  in  paragraphs  41 
and 42 of the report.
With  regard  to  item  121,  “Revitalization  of  the 
work of the General Assembly”, the report containing 
the proposed programme of work and timetable for the 
Fourth  Committee  for  the  Assembly’s  seventy-second 
session is contained in document A/71/503. The Fourth 
Committee recommends the draft decision contained in 
paragraph 5 to the General Assembly for adoption.
The need did not arise for the Fourth Committee to 
take up item 135, “Programme planning”, at this stage, 
as  indicated  in  the  report  of  the  Fourth  Committee 
contained in document A/71/504.
Before concluding, I would like to recall the high 
level of cooperation prevailing in the Special Political 
and  Decolonization  Committee.  The  Committee  was 
able  to  fulfill  the  mandate  entrusted  to  it  by  the  the 
General  Assembly  and  completed  its  work  effectively 
and  constructively  within  the  time  allotted  by  the 
Assembly. On behalf of the Bureau of the Committee, 
I  would  like  to  express  our  sincere  appreciation  to 
all  delegations  for  their  constructive  participation 
in  this  session.  I  should  like  to  pay  particular  tribute 
to  the  Chair  of  the  Fourth  Committee,  Mr.  Vladimir 
Drobnjak of Croatia, whose knowledge and experience 
in  multilateral  forums,  enhanced  by  his  consummate 
diplomatic  skills,  enabled  the  Fourth  Committee  to 
consider in depth all the agenda items allocated to it.
the  Bureau  of 
The  other  members  of 
the 
Fourth  Committee  with  whom  I  had  the  pleasure 
of  working  —  Mr.  Hossein  Maleki  of  the  Islamic 
Republic  of  Iran,  Mr.  Wouter  Poels  of  Belgium  and 
Mr. Juan Antonio Benard Estrada of Guatemala — also 
contributed greatly to the successful conclusion of the 
work of the Fourth Committee. I would also like to put 
on  record  our  appreciation  for  the  able  and  effective 
assistance provided by Ms. Christa Giles, the Secretary 
of the Committee, and her team from the Department 
for General Assembly and Conference Management.
I  now  have  the  honour  to  submit  to  the  General 
Assembly  for  its  consideration  and  adoption  the  draft 
resolutions  and  draft  decisions  recommended  by  the 
Special Political and Decolonization Committee in its 
report in documents A/71/491 to A/71/504.
The  President:  I  thank  the  Rapporteur  of  the 
Special  Political  and  Decolonization  Committee 
(Fourth  Committee)  for  his 
the 
Committee’s reports.
introduction  of 
If  there  is  no  proposal  under  rule  66  of  the  rules 
of procedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly 
decides not to discuss the reports of the Special Political 
and  Decolonization  Committee,  which  are  before  the 
General Assembly today.
It was so decided.
The President: Statements will therefore be limited 
to explanations of vote.
Before  proceeding  further,  I  wish  to  consult 
members about how I intend to proceed to refer to the 
reports  of  the  Committee.  In  order  to  save  time,  and 
given that this afternoon the Assembly is taking up only 
the reports of the Special Political and Decolonization 
Committee  (Fourth  Committee),  I  will  only  mention 
the  term  “the  Committee”  on  the  understanding  that 
the formal name of the Committee, the Special Political 
and Decolonization Committee, will be reflected in the 
official records.
As I hear no objection, we shall proceed accordingly.

regarding 
May  I  remind  members  that  in  accordance  with 
paragraph 7 of decision 34/401, the General Assembly 
agreed that when the same draft resolution is considered 
in  a  Main  Committee  and  in  plenary  meeting,  a 
delegation  should,  as  far  as  possible,  explain  its  vote 
only  once,  that  is,  either  in  the  Committee  or  in  the 
plenary meeting, unless that delegation’s vote in plenary 
meeting is different from its vote in the Committee.

Before  we  begin 
May  I  further  remind  delegations  that,  also  in 
accordance  with  decision  34/401,  explanations  of 
vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by 
delegations from their seats.
to 
the 
recommendations contained in the reports of the Fourth 
Committee, I should like to advise representatives that 
we are going to take decisions in the same manner as 
was done in the Fourth Committee unless the secretariat 
is notified to the contrary in advance. That means that, 
where recorded votes were taken, we will do the same. I 
should also hope that we will proceed to adopt without a 
vote those recommendations that were adopted without 
a vote in the Fourth Committee.
I would like to draw the attention of members to a 
note  by  the  Secretariat,  entitled  “Checklist  of  reports 
of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee 
(Fourth  Committee)  to  the  General  Assembly  on 
agenda  items  47  to  58,  121  to  135”,  which  has  been 
circulated,  in  English  only,  as  document  A/C.4/71/
INF/3. The note has been distributed desk to desk in the 
General Assembly Hall as a reference guide for action 
on draft resolutions and decisions recommended by the 
Committee in its reports. In that connection, members 
will find, in column 4 of the note, the symbols of the 
draft resolutions and decisions of the Committee, with 
the  corresponding  symbols  of  the  reports  for  action 
in the plenary meeting in column 2 of the same note. 
For reports containing multiple recommendations, the 
draft  resolution  or  decision  number  is  contained  in 
column 3 of the note. For reports containing multiple 
recommendations,  the  draft  resolution  or  decision 
number is contained in column 3 of the note.
Furthermore, members are reminded that additional 
sponsors  are  no  longer  accepted  now  that  the  draft 
resolutions  and  decisions  have  been  adopted  by  the 
Committee. Any clarification about sponsorship should 
be  addressed  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Committee.  I 
would also like to remind members that any corrections 
to  the  voting  intention  of  delegations  after  the  voting 
has  concluded  on  a  proposal  should  be  made  directly 
to the secretariat at the end of the meeting. I seek the 
cooperation of members in avoiding any interruptions 
to our proceedings in that regard.
