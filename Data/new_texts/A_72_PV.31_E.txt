Statement by the President
that 
took  place 
the 
terror  attacks 
The  President:  Before  we  begin,  let  me  strongly 
condemn 
in 
Mogadishu  over  the  weekend.  I  want  to  express  my 
deepest condolences to the people and the Government 
of  Somalia.  We  stand  in  solidarity  with  them.  I  am 
outraged  by  the  loss  of  so  many  innocent  lives.  This 
horrific incident further highlights the need for urgent 
action  to  prevent  and  counter  all  forms  of  terrorism, 
including by tackling its root causes.
Agenda item 114

Rights Council
The  President:  The  General  Assembly  will  now 
proceed with the election of 15 members of the Human

The 15 vacant seats should be distributed among the

for  the  Eastern  European  States;  three  seats  for  the 
Latin  American  and  Caribbean  States;  and  two  seats 
for the Western European and other States.
In accordance with resolution 60/251, membership 
in the Council shall be open to all States Members of 
the  United  Nations,  and  the  members  of  the  Council 
shall serve for a period of three years. The members of 
the Council shall be elected directly and individually, 
by secret ballot, by the majority of the members of the 
General  Assembly.  Accordingly,  97  votes  constitute 
a  majority  in  the  General  Assembly,  which  has  a 
membership of 193 States.
The following States will continue to be members

papers, as they have served two consecutive terms and 
are  therefore  not  eligible  for  this  election:  Botswana, 
the Congo, India and Indonesia.
The  election  will  be  held  in  accordance  with  the 
relevant  rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly 
on  elections.  For  this  election,  rule  92  of  the  rules 
of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly,  as  recently 
amended  by  Assembly  resolution  71/323,  and  rule  94 
shall be applied. Accordingly, the election shall be held 
by secret ballot.
Consistent  with 
the  practice  of 
the  General 
Assembly, if more than the required number of Member 
States  have  obtained  the  votes  of  the  majority  of  the 
members  of  the  Assembly  on  the  same  ballot,  those 
Member  States  that  have  obtained  the  largest  number 
of votes above the required majority will be considered 
as elected, up to the number of seats to be filled. Also 
consistent  with  past  practice,  if,  due  to  a  tie  vote,  it 
becomes  necessary  to  determine  one  candidate  to 
be  elected  or  that  will  proceed  to  the  next  round  of 
restricted  balloting,  there  will  be  a  special  restricted 
ballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an 
equal number of votes.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to 
these procedures?
It was so decided.
The  President:  I  have  also  been  informed  by  the 
Secretariat  that  voluntary  pledges  and  commitments 
made by Member States in accordance with operative 
paragraph  8  of  General  Assembly  resolution  60/251 
were  accordingly  issued  as  official  documents  of  the 
seventy-second session of the General Assembly.
Before we begin the voting process, I should like to 
remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of 
procedure of the General Assembly, no representative 
shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order on 
the actual conduct of the voting.
I  should  like  to  seek  the  usual  cooperation  of 
representatives  during  the  time  when  the  General 
Assembly is conducting elections and remind them that 
during  the  voting  procedure,  all  campaigning  should 
cease in the General Assembly Hall. This means that, 
once the meeting has begun, no more campaign material 
can be distributed inside the Hall. All representatives 
are  also  requested  to  remain  at  their  seats  so  that  the 
voting  process  can  proceed  in  an  orderly  manner.  I 
thank members for their cooperation.
I should also like to remind delegations to refrain 
from  extending  congratulations 
the  General 
Assembly  Hall  after  the  announcement  of  the  elected 
members. This is disruptive to the distribution of ballot 
papers  for  any  subsequent  round  of  balloting.  I  thank 
members for your cooperation.
in 
We shall now begin the voting process.
Ballot papers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E” 
will now be distributed. Each ballot paper is assigned to 
one of the five regional groups. I request representatives 
to use only these ballot papers. In addition, ballot papers 
will be given only to the representative seated directly 
behind the country’s nameplate.
In  accordance  with  General  Assembly  resolution 
71/323,  which  sets  out  a  new  arrangement  for  ballot 
papers,  the  names  of  the  candidates  that  have  been 
communicated  to  the  Secretariat  prior  to  the  election 
have  been  printed  on  the  ballot  papers  for  each  of 
the  regional  groups.  Also,  additional  blank  lines 
corresponding to the number of vacant seats to be filled 
for each of the regional groups have been provided on the 
ballot papers for inscribing other names as necessary.
Representatives  are  requested  to  check  the  boxes 
next  to  the  names  of  candidates  that  are  printed  on 
the ballot papers and/or write other eligible names on 
the  blank  lines.  The  total  number  of  checked  boxes 
and handwritten names may not exceed the number of 
vacant seats to be filled as indicated on the ballot paper. 
A ballot paper containing more votes than the number 
of  vacant  seats  indicated  on  the  ballot  paper  will  be 
declared invalid.
Accordingly,  for  the  ballot  paper  marked  “A”,  for 
African States, the total number of checked boxes and 
handwritten names should not exceed four candidates; 
for the ballot paper marked “B”, for Asia-Pacific States, 
the  total  number  of  checked  boxes  and  handwritten 
names should not exceed four candidates; for the ballot 
paper  marked  “C”,  for  Eastern  European  States,  the 
total number of checked boxes and handwritten names 
should not exceed two candidates; for the ballot paper 
marked “D”, for Latin American and Caribbean States, 
the  total  number  of  checked  boxes  and  handwritten 
names should not exceed three candidates; and for the 
ballot  papers  marked  “E”,  for  Western  European  and 
other  States,  the  total  number  of  checked  boxes  and 
handwritten names should not exceed two candidates.
