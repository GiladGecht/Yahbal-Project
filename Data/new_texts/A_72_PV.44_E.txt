The  President:  Today,  the  General  Assembly 
will  proceed  to  the  election  of  five  members  of  the 
International  Court  of  Justice  for  a  nine-year  term  of 
office  commencing  on  6  February  2018.  The  judges 
whose  terms  of  office  expire  on  5  February  2018 
are  Judge  Ronny  Abraham  (France),  Judge  Dalveer 
Bhandari  (India),  Judge  Antônio  Augusto  Cançado 
Trindade  (Brazil),  Judge  Christopher  Greenwood 
(United  Kingdom  of  Great  Britain  and  Northern 
Ireland), and Judge Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf (Somalia).
I should like to draw the attention of the General 
Assembly to the documents it has before it relating to this 
election. Document A/72/181 contains a memorandum 
by the Secretary-General on the current composition of 
the Court and on the procedures to be followed in the 
General Assembly and the Security Council with regard 
to the election. Document A/72/182 contains the list of 
candidates  nominated  by  national  groups.  Document 
A/72/183 contains the curricula vitae of the candidates 
nominated by national groups.
In  that  connection,  I  have  been  notified  by  the 
Legal  Counsel  that  after  the  deadline  established  for 
nominating  candidates,  an  additional  nomination 
was received with respect to a candidate whose name 
already appears in document A/72/182. The additional 
nomination  in  question,  of  Mr.  Dalveer  Bhandari 
(India), is from the national group of Sri Lanka.
I  should  also  like  to  draw  the  attention  of  the 
Assembly to a note by the Secretary-General contained 
in document A/72/182/Add.1, in which he informs the 
Assembly that the national group of Zambia has decided 
to withdraw its nomination of Mr. Chaloka Beyani as 
a candidate. His name is therefore not included on the 
ballot papers. The names of the following six candidates 
will therefore appear on the ballot papers: Mr. Ronny 
Abraham  (France),  Mr.  Dalveer  Bhandari  (India), 
Mr.  Antônio  Augusto  Cançado  Trindade  (Brazil), 
Mr.  Christopher  Greenwood  (United  Kingdom  of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Mr. Nawaf Salam 
(Lebanon) and Mr. Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf (Somalia).
I should like to confirm that at this time, the General 
Assembly  and  the  Security  Council  will  proceed, 
independently  of  one  another,  to  elect  five  members 
of  the  Court  to  fill  the  vacancies  in  accordance  with 
Article  8  of  the  Statute  of  the  International  Court  of 
Justice. This election in the Assembly will be held in 
accordance with the Statute of the Court, in particular 
Articles 2 to 4 and 7 to 12, and with rules 150 and 151 
of  the  rules  of  procedure  of  the  General  Assembly. 
This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches 
delivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. 
They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member 
of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 
(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official 
Document System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).

According to Article 2 of the Statute, members of the 
Court are to be elected, regardless of their nationality, 
from  among  persons  of  high  moral  character  who 
possess  the  qualifications  required  in  their  respective 
countries  for  appointment  to  the  highest  judicial 
offices, or are jurisconsults of recognized competence 
in international law. Article 9 requires electors to bear 
in mind not only that the person to be elected should 
individually  possess  the  qualifications  required,  but 
also that in the body as a whole, the representation of 
the main forms of civilization and of the principal legal 
systems of the world should be assured.
In accordance with Article 10, paragraph 1, of the 
Statute  of  the  Court,  those  candidates  who  obtain  an 
absolute majority of votes both in the General Assembly 
and  in  the  Security  Council  shall  be  considered  as 
elected. The consistent practice of the United Nations 
has been to interpret the words “absolute majority” as 
meaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they 
vote or are allowed to vote. The electors in the General 
Assembly will be all 193 Member States. Accordingly, 
for  the  purposes  of  the  present  election,  97  votes 
constitute an absolute majority in the General Assembly.
Only those candidates whose names appear on the 
ballot  papers  are  eligible  for  election.  The  electors  in 
the General Assembly will indicate the candidates for 
whom they wish to vote by placing crosses against their 
names on the ballot papers. Each elector may vote for 
not  more  than  five  candidates  on  the  first  ballot  and, 
on subsequent ballots, if any, for five candidates, less 
the  number  of  candidates  who  have  already  obtained 
absolute majorities.
At  the  915th  plenary  meeting  of  the  General 
Assembly,  held  on  16  November  1960,  a  procedural 
discussion  was  held  as  to  whether  rule  94  —  then 
rule  96  —  of  the  rules  of  procedure  of  the  Assembly 
should  be  applied  in  elections  to  the  International 
Court  of  Justice.  That  rule  lays  down  a  procedure 
for  restricted  ballots  in  the  event  that,  after  the  first 
ballot,  the  requisite  number  of  candidates  have  not 
obtained the required majority. By 47 votes to 27, with 
25 abstentions, the Assembly decided that the rule did 
not  apply  to  elections  to  the  Court  and  proceeded  to 
elect the requisite number of candidates by a series of 
unrestricted  ballots.  That  decision  has  subsequently 
been followed consistently.
Accordingly,  pursuant  to  rule  151  of  the  rules  of 
procedure of the Assembly, if in the first ballot in the 
General Assembly, the number of candidates obtaining 
an absolute majority is less than five, a second ballot will 
be held on the remaining candidates and balloting will 
continue at the same meeting until five candidates have 
obtained the required majority. Balloting will continue 
in the same meeting until five of the candidates have 
obtained the required majority of votes. However, if in 
the first or subsequent ballots more than five candidates 
obtain an absolute majority, the General Assembly shall 
follow  the  established  practice  and  proceed  to  a  new 
vote on all the candidates. Balloting will continue in the 
same manner until five of the candidates have obtained 
the required majority. Only when five candidates, not 
more or fewer, have obtained the required majority in 
the Assembly will the President of the Assembly notify 
the President of the Security Council of the names of 
the five candidates.
In  accordance  with  Article  11  of  the  Statute,  if 
upon  comparison  of  the  respective  lists  of  candidates 
who have obtained an absolute majority in the General 
Assembly  and  in  the  Security  Council,  fewer  than 
five  candidates  have  been  thus  elected,  the  Assembly 
and  the  Council  will  proceed,  again  independently  of 
one another, at a second meeting — and, if necessary, 
a  third  —  to  elect  candidates  by  further  ballots  for 
the  seats  remaining  vacant,  the  results  again  being 
compared after the required number of candidates have 
obtained an absolute majority in each organ.
If,  however,  after  the  third  meeting,  one  or  more 
seats still remain unfilled, the General Assembly and 
the  Security  Council  may  at  any  time,  at  the  request 
of  either  organ,  form  a  joint  conference  consisting  of 
six members, three appointed by each organ. That joint 
conference may, by an absolute majority, agree on one 
name for each seat still vacant and submit the name or 
names  for  the  respective  acceptance  of  the  Assembly 
and the Council. If the joint conference is unanimously 
agreed, it may submit the name of a person not included 
in the list of nominations, provided that candidate fulfils 
the required conditions, in accordance with Article 12, 
paragraph 2, of the Statute.
If the joint conference is satisfied that it will not be 
successful in procuring an election, those members of 
the Court who have already been elected shall, within 
a period to be fixed by the Security Council, proceed 
to fill the vacant seat or seats by selection from among 
those  candidates  who  have  obtained  votes  either  in 
the  General  Assembly  or  in  the  Security  Council.  In 
accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 12 of the 
2/5 
17-37231
09/11/2017 
A/72/PV.44
Statute, in the event of an equality of votes among the 
judges, the eldest shall have a casting vote.
May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to 
these procedures at this election?
It was so decided.
The President: I should like to remind representatives 
that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure,
“After 
the  President  has  announced 
the 
beginning  of  voting,  no  representative  shall 
interrupt  the  voting  except  on  a  point  of  order  in 
connection with the actual conduct of the voting”.
Any  announcements,  including  those  concerning 
withdrawals of candidatures, should therefore be made 
prior to the commencement of the voting process, that 
is to say, before the announcement of the beginning of 
the voting process.
The  meeting  was  suspended  at  10.30  a.m.  and 
resumed at 11.10 a.m.
The President: The result of the voting is as follows:
Number of ballot papers:  
Number of invalid ballots:  
Number of valid ballots:

I  should  like  to  seek  the  usual  cooperation  of 
representatives  during  the  time  of  the  conduct  of  the 
election. Members are reminded that during the voting 
process,  all  campaigning  should  cease  in  the  General 
Assembly Hall. That means in particular that once the 
election  has  begun,  no  more  campaign  material  can 
be  distributed  inside  the  Hall.  All  representatives  are 
also requested to remain at their seats so that the voting 
process  can  proceed  in  an  orderly  manner.  I  thank 
members for their cooperation.
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Ballot 
papers will now be distributed.
to 
Ballot  papers  will  be  given  only 
the 
representatives  seated  directly  behind  the  country’s 
nameplate.  Representatives  are  requested  to  use  only 
the  ballot  papers  that  are  being  distributed.  Only 
those  candidates  whose  names  appear  on  the  ballot 
papers  are  eligible.  Representatives  will  indicate  the 
five candidates for whom they wish to vote by placing 
crosses to the left of their names on the ballot papers. 
Ballot  papers  on  which  more  than  five  names  are 
marked will be considered invalid. Votes may be cast 
only for those whose names appear on the ballot papers.
At  the  invitation  of  the  President,  Mr.  Aldoseri 
(Bahrain), Ms. Sánchez Rodríguez (Cuba), Mrs. Le 
Diffard (Hungary), Ms. Rheindrayani (Indonesia), 
Mr.  Zamporlini  (Italy)  and  Mr.  Waweru  (Kenya) 
acted as tellers.
A vote was taken by secret ballot.
In  the  ballot  just  completed,  more  than  five 
candidates have obtained an absolute majority. Pursuant 
to  the  decision  taken  by  the  General  Assembly  at  the 
45th  plenary  meeting  of  its  fifty-fourth  session,  on 
3 November 1999, and in accordance with the decision 
taken at the beginning of this meeting, a new ballot will 
be held until only the required number of candidates, 
and  no  more,  obtain  an  absolute  majority.  We  shall 
therefore proceed to another unrestricted ballot to fill 
the remaining five vacancies.
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Ballot 
papers will now be distributed.
Ballot  papers  will  be  given  only 
seated  directly  behind

are  eligible.  I  would  like  to  remind  delegations  that 
the  names  of  no  more  than  five  candidates  should  be 
marked with a cross. Any ballot paper on which more 
than five names are marked will be considered invalid. 
Votes may be cast only for those whose names appear 
on the ballot papers.

absolute majority in the General Assembly: Mr. Ronny 
Abraham, Mr. Dalveer Bhandari, Mr. Antônio Augusto 
Cançado Trindade, Mr. Nawaf Salam and Mr. Abdulqawi 
Ahmed Yusuf.
I have communicated the results of the voting to the 
President of the Security Council.
I have also received a letter from the President of 
the Security Council, which reads:
“I  have  the  honour  to  inform  you  that  at  the 
8092nd  meeting  of  the  Security  Council,  held  on 
9 November 2017, for the purpose of electing five 
members  of  the  International  Court  of  Justice  for 
a  term  of  office  beginning  on  6  February  2018, 
Mr. Ronny Abraham (France), Mr. Antônio Augusto 
Cançado  Trindade 
(Brazil),  Mr.  Christopher 
Greenwood (United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland), Mr. Nawaf Salam (Lebanon) and 
Mr.  Abdulqawi  Ahmed  Yusuf  (Somalia)  obtained 
an absolute majority of votes.”
As a result of the independent voting in the General 
Assembly  and  in  the  Security  Council,  the  following 
four  candidates  have  obtained  an  absolute  majority 
in  both  bodies:  Mr.  Ronny  Abraham,  Mr.  Antônio 
Augusto  Cançado  Trindade,  Mr.  Nawaf  Salam  and 
Mr.  Abdulqawi  Ahmed  Yusuf.  They  are  therefore 
duly  elected  members  of  the  International  Court  of 
Justice  to  serve  for  a  nine-year  term  commencing  on 
6 February 2018. I would like to take this opportunity 
to extend to them the congratulations of the Assembly 
on their election.
In accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of 
the  Statute  of  the  Court,  it  will  be  necessary  to  hold 
another meeting to fill the remaining vacancy.
I propose that the present meeting be adjourned and 
that  the  45th  meeting  be  held  immediately  to  vote  on 
the remaining vacancy.
It was so decided.
The meeting rose at 6.10 p.m.
