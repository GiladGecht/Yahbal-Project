The  Acting  President:  As  members  are  aware, 
there is still one vacancy on the Court to be filled. The 
Assembly  will  now  proceed  to  vote  in  respect  of  the 
remaining vacancy.
We  shall  now  begin  the  voting  process.  Ballot 
papers  will  now  be  distributed.  Ballot  papers  will  be 
given only to the representative seated directly behind 
the country’s nameplate. Representatives are requested 
to use only the ballot papers that are being distributed.
The  two  candidates  whose  names  appear  on  the 
ballot paper are eligible.
May  I  remind  delegations  that  only  the  box  next 
to the name of one candidate should be marked with a 
cross. Any ballot paper on which more than one name 
is checked will be considered invalid. Votes may be cast 
only for those whose names appear on the ballot papers.

Ms.  Sánchez  Rodríguez  (Cuba),  Mrs.  Le  Diffard 
(Hungary), Ms. Rheindrayani (Indonesia), Mr. McSwiney 
(Ireland) and Mr. Waweru (Kenya) acted as tellers.

“I  have  the  honour  to  inform  you  that  at  the 
8095th  meeting  of  the  Security  Council,  held  on 
13  November  2017,  for  the  purpose  of  electing 
one  member  of  the  International  Court  of  Justice 
for a term of office beginning on 6 February 2018, 
Mr.  Christopher  Greenwood  (United  Kingdom  of 
Great  Britain  and  Northern  Ireland)  obtained  an 
absolute majority of votes.”
The  same  candidate  was  not  successful  in  both 
the  General  Assembly  and  the  Security  Council.  In 
accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Article  11  of  the 
Statute of the Court, it will be necessary to hold another 
meeting  to  fill  the  remaining  vacancy.  I  propose  that 
this meeting be adjourned and that the 51st meeting be 
held immediately to vote on the remaining vacancy. 
It was so decided.
The meeting rose at 4.30 p.m.
