Reports of the First Committee
The  President  (spoke  in  Spanish):  The  General 
Assembly  will  now  take  up  the  reports  of  the  First 
Committee on agenda items 93 to 108, 123 and 137.
I  request  the  Rapporteur  of  the  First  Committee, 
Ms.  Muna  Zawani  Mohammad  Idris  of  Brunei 
Darussalam,  to  introduce  the  reports  of  the  First 
Committee in one intervention.
Ms.  Mohammad  Idris  (Brunei  Darussalam), 
Rapporteur of the First Committee: I have the honour 
to introduce to the General Assembly the reports of the 
Disarmament  and  International  Security  Committee, 
the First Committee, on agenda items 93 to 108, 123 and 
137, as contained in documents A/73/502 to A/73/519. 
For the convenience of delegations, a checklist prepared 
by the Secretariat of action taken in the First Committee 
is contained in document A/C.1/73/INF/3.
During 
this  main  part  of 
the  seventy-third 
session,  the  Disarmament  and  International  Security 
Committee  held  a  total  of  31  formal  meetings  to 
consider the 19 agenda items that were allocated to it. 
During  this  session,  135  delegations  made  statements 
during  the  general  debate  segment,  as  compared  with 
131  delegations  in  2017.  Also,  an  impressive  354 
interventions were made during the thematic discussion 
segment, as compared with 312 interventions made in 
2017. That shows an upward trend in participation in the 
work of the Committee.
During  the  action  phase,  the  Committee  adopted 
68  draft  resolutions  and  decisions  —  one  was 
withdrawn  —  39  of  which  were  adopted  as  a  whole 
by  a  recorded  vote,  with  50  separate  votes  requested. 
Twenty-nine  draft  proposals  were  adopted  as  a  whole 
without  a  vote,  of  which  23  were  not  on  voted  on  at 
all,  either  on  separate  paragraphs  or  as  a  whole.  Of 
the  68  draft  resolutions  and  decisions  adopted  by 
the  Committee,  25  were  under  the  cluster  “Nuclear 
weapons”.  Under  the  cluster  “Other  weapons  of  mass 
destruction”,  five  draft  resolutions  are  recommended. 
In  addition,  four  drafts  are  recommended  under  the 
cluster “Outer space (disarmament aspects)”, nine under 
“Conventional  weapons”,  12  on  “Other  disarmament 
measures and international security”, five on “Regional 
disarmament and security” and, finally, eight under the 
cluster “Disarmament machinery”.
The  Secretariat  made  oral  statements  on  the 
financial  implications  of  12  draft  resolutions  adopted 
by the Committee under agenda items 96, 101, 102, 103, 
105 and 108. Documents were issued on the programme 
budget  implications  for  the  draft  resolution  entitled 
“Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace 
in  the  context  of  international  security”  and  the  draft 
decision  entitled  “Convening  a  conference  on  the 
establishment  of  a  Middle  East  zone  free  of  nuclear 
weapons  and  other  weapons  of  mass  destruction”, 
submitted  under  agenda  items  97,  104  and  136, 
respectively.  With  respect  to  the  draft  resolution 
entitled “Developments in the field of information and 
telecommunications  in  the  context  of  international 
security”, the Secretariat informed the Committee that

the  oral  statement  read  out  superseded  the  statement 
of  programme  budget  implications  that  was  initially 
issued as document A/C.1/73/L.71.
With regard to item 123, “Revitalization of the work 
of the General Assembly”, the draft decision containing 
the  provisional  programme  of  work  and  timetable  of 
the First Committee for 2019 is contained in document 
A/73/518.
I have the honour to submit to the General Assembly 
for its consideration and adoption the draft resolutions 
and draft decisions recommended by the Disarmament 
and  International  Security  Committee  in  its  reports 
contained in documents A/73/502 to A/73/519.
With  respect  to  the  report  on  agenda  item  101, 
issued  as  document  A/73/510,  I  would  like  to  inform 
the Assembly for the record that the delegation of Cuba 
intended to abstain in the voting on operative paragraph 
2  of  draft  resolution  A/C.1/73/L.54,  entitled  “United 
action  with  renewed  determination  towards  the  total 
elimination of nuclear weapons”, and vote in favour of 
operative paragraph 5 of the same draft resolution.
Before concluding, I would like to recall the high 
level of cooperation prevailing in the First Committee. 
The Committee was able to fulfil the mandate entrusted 
to  it  by  the  General  Assembly  and  complete  its  work 
within the time allotted by the Assembly. On behalf of 
the Bureau of the Committee, I would like to express 
our  sincere  appreciation  to  all  delegations  for  their 
constructive  participation  during  the  session.  In  that 
regard, I would note in particular the positive manner 
in  which  the  First  Committee  delegations  continue  to 
embrace the e-Delegate portal.
I should also like to express my deep appreciation 
to  the  Chair  of  the  First  Committee,  His  Excellency 
Ambassador  Ion  Jinga  of  Romania,  whose  knowledge 
and  experience  in  multilateral  forums  enabled  the 
Committee to successfully consider all the agenda items 
allocated  to  it  in  a  timely  and  efficient  manner.  The 
other members of the Bureau — Ms. Marissa Edwards 
of  Guyana,  Mr.  José  Ataíde  Amaral  of  Portugal  and 
Mr. Noël Diarra of Mali, with whom I had the pleasure 
of working — also contributed greatly to the successful 
conclusion of the work of the Committee.
Finally,  I  would  like  to  recognize  the  dedicated 
support of Ms. Izumi Nakamitsu, High Representative 
for  Disarmament  Affairs,  and  the  staff  of  the  United 
Nations  Office  for  Disarmament  Affairs,  as  well  as 
the Secretary of the Committee and her team from the 
Department  for  General  Assembly  and  Conference 
Management, conference officers, interpreters, record 
keepers,  press  officers,  document  officers,  sound 
technicians and information technology staff.
The  President  (spoke  in  Spanish):  I  thank  the 
The  positions  of  delegations 
Rapporteur of the First Committee for her report.
regarding 
the 
recommendations  of  the  First  Committee  have  been 
made  clear  in  the  Committee  and  are  reflected  in 
the  relevant  official  records.  Therefore,  if  there  is  no 
proposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall 
take it that the General Assembly decides not to discuss 
the reports of the First Committee that are before the 
Assembly today.
It was so decided.
The President (spoke in Spanish): Statements will 
therefore be limited to explanations of vote or position.
Mr.  Yelchenko  (Ukraine),  Vice-President,  took 
the Chair.
The  Acting  President:  May  I  remind  members 
that,  in  accordance  with  General  Assembly  decision 
34/401, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain 
its vote only once, that is, either in the Committee or in 
plenary meeting, unless that delegation’s vote in plenary 
meeting  is  different  from  its  vote  in  the  Committee. 
In  addition,  I  remind  members  that  explanations  are 
limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations 
from their seats.
to 
take  action  on 
Before  we  begin 
the 
recommendations contained in the reports of the First 
Committee,  I  should  like  to  advise  representatives 
that  we  are  going  to  proceed  to  take  decisions  in  the 
same  manner  as  was  done  in  the  Committee,  unless 
the  Secretariat  was  notified  otherwise  in  advance. 
That  means  that,  where  separate  or  recorded  votes 
were  taken,  we  will  do  the  same.  I  should  also  hope 
that  we  may  proceed  to  adopt  without  a  vote  those 
recommendations that were adopted without a vote in 
the  First  Committee.  The  results  of  the  votes  will  be 
uploaded on the PaperSmart portal.
I  would  like  to  draw  the  attention  of  members 
to  a  note  by  the  Secretariat,  in  English  only,  entitled 
“Situation  reports  of  the  First  Committee  on  agenda 
items  93  to  108,  123  and  137”,  which  has  been 
circulated  as  document  A/C.1/73/INF/3.  The  note  has 
2/61 
18-41374
15/12/2018 
A/73/PV.45
been distributed desk to desk in the General Assembly 
Hall as a reference guide for action on draft resolutions 
and decisions recommended by the First Committee in 
its reports.
Members  will  find  in  column  2  of  the  note  the 
symbols  of  the  draft  resolutions  and  decisions  of  the 
First Committee, with the corresponding symbols of the 
reports for action in the plenary in column 4 of the same 
note. For reports containing multiple recommendations, 
the draft resolution or decision number is contained in 
column 5 of the note.
Members  are  reminded  that  additional  sponsors 
are no longer accepted now that draft resolutions and 
decisions  have  been  adopted  by  the  Committee.  Any 
clarification  about  co-sponsorship  in  the  Committee 
reports  should  be  addressed  to  the  Secretary  of 
the Committee.
Furthermore,  members  are  reminded  that  any 
corrections to the voting intentions of delegations after 
the voting on a proposal is concluded should be made 
directly to the Secretariat after the meeting. I ask for 
members’ cooperation in avoiding any interruptions in 
our proceedings in that regard.
