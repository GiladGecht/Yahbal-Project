introduce  to  the  General  Assembly  the  reports  of 
the  Special  Political  and  Decolonization  Committee 
(Fourth Committee) submitted under agenda items 51 to 
63, 123 and 137. Those reports, contained in documents 
A/73/470 to A/73/476, A/73/521, A/73/523 to A/73/526 
and  A/73/532  to  A/73/534,  include  the  texts  of  draft 
resolutions and decisions recommended to the Assembly 
for  adoption.  For  the  convenience  of  delegations,  a 
checklist has been prepared by the Secretariat showing 
actions taken in the Special Political and Decolonization 
Committee, which is contained in A/C.4/73/INF/3.
During the main part of the seventy-third session, 
the  Special  Political  and  Decolonization  Committee 
held  a  total  of  28  formal  meetings,  during  the  course 
of which it adopted 36 draft resolutions and four draft 
decisions,  including  its  programmes  of  work  for  the 
seventy-third and seventy-fourth sessions.
The  first  report,  submitted  under  agenda  item 
51,  entitled  “University  for  Peace”,  is  contained  in

of  maintaining  outer  space  for  peaceful  purposes 
and  to  report  thereon  to  the  Assembly  at  its  seventy-

Granting  of  Independence 
to  Colonial  Countries 
and  Peoples  —  agenda  items  59  to  63  —  the  Fourth

Polynesia,  the  President  of  the  Government  of  New 
Caledonia and the Deputy Chief Minister of Gibraltar.
Under those items, the General Assembly has before 
it the following five reports: the report submitted under 
agenda  item  59,  entitled  “Information  from  Non-Self-
Governing  Territories  transmitted  under  Article  73 
e  of  the  Charter  of  the  United  Nations”,  contained  in 
document A/73/473; the report submitted under agenda

of the General Assembly”, the draft decision containing 
the proposed programme of work and timetable for the 
Fourth  Committee  for  the  Assembly’s  seventy-fourth 
session is contained in document A/73/533. The Fourth 
Committee  recommends  the  draft  decision  to  the 
General Assembly for adoption.
The need did not arise for the Committee to take 
up  item  137,  “Programme  planning”,  at  this  stage,  as 
indicated in the report of the Committee contained in 
document A/73/534.
I have the honour to submit to the General Assembly 
for its consideration and adoption the draft resolutions 
and  draft  decisions  recommended  by  the  Special 
Political  and  Decolonization  Committee 
(Fourth 
Committee)  in  its  reports  contained  in  documents

and A/73/532 to A/73/534.
Before concluding, I would like to recall the high 
level of cooperation that prevails in the Special Political 
and  Decolonization  Committee  (Fourth  Committee). 
The  Committee  was  able 
the  mandate 
entrusted  to  it  by  the  Assembly  and  to  effectively 
and  constructively  complete  its  work  within  the  time 
allotted by the Assembly. I should like to express, on 
behalf  of  the  Bureau  of  the  Committee,  our  sincere 
appreciation  to  all  delegations  for  their  constructive 
participation during this session.
to  fulfil 
I should like to pay particular tribute to the Chair of 
the Fourth Committee, His Excellency Mr. Dee-Maxwell 
Saah Kemayah, Sr., of Liberia, whose knowledge and 
experience,  enhanced  by  his  consummate  diplomatic 
skills, enabled the Committee to consider in depth all 
the  agenda  items  allocated  to  it.  The  other  members 
of  the  Bureau,  my  personal  friends  Mr.  Faisal  Nasser 
Alhakbani  of  Saudi  Arabia,  Mr.  Daniel  Goldea  of 
Hungary  and  Mr.  Michael  O’Toole  of  Ireland,  with 
whom I had the pleasure of working, also contributed 
greatly  to  the  successful  conclusion  of  the  work  of 
the Committee.
I should also like to place on record our appreciation 
for  the  able  and  effective  assistance  provided  by  the 
Department  of  Political  Affairs  and  the  Disarmament 
and Peace Affairs Branch of the Department for General 
Assembly and Conference Management, which  served 
as the secretariat of the Committee.
The  President  (spoke  in  Spanish):  I  thank  the 
Rapporteur of the Special Political and Decolonization 
Committee (Fourth Committee).
regarding 
The  positions  of  delegations 
the 
recommendations  of  the  Committee  have  been  made 
clear in the Committee and are reflected in the relevant 
official records. Therefore, if there is no proposal under 
rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the 
General  Assembly  decides  not  to  discuss  the  reports 
of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee 
(Fourth Committee) that are before the Assembly today.
It was so decided.
The  President 
(spoke 
in  Spanish):  Before 
proceeding,  I  wish  to  consult  delegations  on  how 
I  intend  to  proceed  to  refer  to  the  reports  of  the 
Committee. In order to save time, I will use only the 
term  “the  Committee”,  on  the  understanding  that  the 
formal  name  of  the  Committee,  the  Special  Political 
and  Decolonization  Committee  (Fourth  Committee), 
will be reflected in the official records.
If I hear no objection, we shall proceed accordingly.
May  I  remind  delegations  that,  in  accordance 
with  paragraph  7  of  decision  34/401,  the  General 
Assembly  agreed  that  when  the  same  draft  resolution 
is  considered  in  a  Main  Committee  and  in  plenary 
meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain 
its vote only once, that is, either in the Committee or in 
plenary meeting, unless that delegation’s vote in plenary 
meeting is different from its vote in the Committee.
May  I  further  remind  delegations  that,  also  in 
accordance  with  General  Assembly  decision  34/401, 
explanations  of  vote  are  limited  to  10  minutes  and 
should be made by delegations from their seats.
Before  we  begin 
the 
recommendations  contained  in  the  reports  of  the 
Committee,  I  should  like  to  advise  delegations  that 
we are going to take decisions in the same manner as 
take  action  on 
to

was  done  in  the  Committee,  unless  the  Secretariat  is 
notified  to  the  contrary  in  advance.  That  means  that, 
where recorded votes were taken, we will do the same. 
I also hope that we will proceed to adopt without a vote 
those  recommendations  that  were  adopted  without  a 
vote in the Committee. The results of the votes will be 
uploaded on the PaperSmart portal.
Before  proceeding  further,  I  would  like  to  draw 
the attention of delegations to a note by the Secretariat 
entitled  “Checklist  of  reports  of  the  Special  Political 
and  Decolonization  Committee  (Fourth  Committee) 
to  the  General  Assembly  on  agenda  items  51  to  63, 
123  and  137”,  which  has  been  circulated,  in  English 
only, as document A/C.4/73/INF/3. The note has been 
distributed desk to desk in the General Assembly Hall 
as a reference guide for action on the draft resolutions 
and  decisions  recommended  by  the  Committee  in 
its reports.
In that connection, delegations will find in column 
4  of  the  note  the  numbers  of  the  draft  resolutions  or 
decisions  of  the  Committee,  with  the  corresponding 
symbols  of  the  reports  for  action  in  the  plenary  in 
column  2  of  the  same  note.  For  reports  containing 
multiple  recommendations,  the  number  of  the  draft 
resolution  or  decision  is  contained  in  column  3  of 
the note.
Delegations are reminded that additional sponsors 
are  no  longer  accepted  once  draft  resolutions  and 
decisions  have  been  adopted  by  the  Committee.  Any 
clarification  about  sponsorship  should  be  addressed 
to the secretariat of the Committee. I would also like 
to  remind  delegations  that  any  corrections  to  their 
voting intentions after the voting has concluded should 
be  made  directly  to  the  Secretariat.  I  would  seek  the 
cooperation of delegations in avoiding any interruptions 
to the proceedings in that regard.

The  Acting  President:  I  now  give  the  floor  to 
the  representative  of  Cuba,  who  wishes  to  speak  in 
explanation of position on resolution 73/113.
(Cuba) 
(spoke 
Ms.  Rodríguez  Abascal 
in 
Spanish):  With  regard  to  resolution  73/113,  entitled 
“Question of Guam”, the delegation of Cuba joined the 
consensus because the resolution summarizes the work 
of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee 
(Fourth  Committee)  —  of  which  it  is  a  member  and 
Vice-Chair  —  on  the  non-autonomous  territory  of 
Guam,  which  still  does  not  have  the  right  of  self-
determination to decide whether it wishes to continue 
to  be  subordinated  to  the  administering  Power,  the 
United  States,  or  whether  it  prefers  to  break  with  its 
colonial ties and be an independent, sovereign country.
Nevertheless, we wish to place on record the fact 
that the delegation of Cuba dissociates itself from the 
contents of the eighteenth and twenty-seventh preambular 
paragraphs. As adopted, the resolution — which reflects 
18-41777
17/18
A/73/PV.48 
07/12/2018
the amendments incorporated at the time of its adoption 
by the Fourth Committee — does not take into account 
the  serious  concerns  expressed  in  United  Nations 
decolonization forums by the representatives of Guam 
with  regard  to  the  ruling  by  a  United  States  federal 
court  on  the  non-acceptance  by  that  country’s  legal 
bodies of regulations recognizing the exclusivity of the 
native inhabitants of Guam and any American citizens 
living there with respect to their equal right to vote in 
a referendum. The ruling put a stop to the plebiscite.
Similarly,  the  amendment  made  to  the  other 
paragraph  completely  removed  the  clear  reference 
to  the  fact  that  the  Chamorro  Land  Trust  programme
was put in place to facilitate the transfer of land to the 
original owners.
Using  the  forum  of  the  General  Assembly  while 
totally  circumventing  the  decolonization  forums  and 
consequently  disregarding  the  lack  of  a  negotiating 
process  between  the  two  parties  —  representatives 
of  the  territory  of  Guam  and  the  administering 
Power — is a regrettable attempt to flout the principle 
of  multilateralism,  which  all  the  Members  of  the 
Organization must adhere to and defend.
For  those  reasons,  we  reiterate  that  the  Cuban 
delegation  dissociates  itself  from  the  eighteenth  and 
twenty-seventh preambular paragraphs.
The  Acting  President:  May  I  take  it  that  it  is 
the  wish  of  the  General  Assembly  to  conclude  its 
consideration of agenda item 63?
It was so decided.
