Mr. Cabactulan (Philippines): Allow me at the outset to congratulate Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his election and to offer the Philippines full support for his leadership in this sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly.

That is the rules-based framework that underpins everything we want to build
