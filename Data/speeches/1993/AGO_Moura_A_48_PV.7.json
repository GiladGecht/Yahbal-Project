{"speech":{"0":" Mr INSANALLY (Guyana) __________ The meeting was called to order at 3.30 p.m. May I also take this opportunity to say a special word of congratulations to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, on his outstanding stewardship of the United Nations during these critical times, when the world body is increasingly being called upon to respond promptly and effectively to complex situations all over the world. ADDRESS PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF ZIMBABWE BY MR. ROBERT G. MUGABE, The PRESIDENT: The Assembly will first hear an address by the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe. Mr. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall. As the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization approaches, there is great merit in our taking stock of what the United Nations has achieved in the maintenance of peace and security and in fostering international cooperation for development. It is also our duty at this session to explore ways and means of further strengthening this body so that it is better equipped to fulfil its purposes and principles as enshrined in the Charter. On behalf of The PRESIDENT: the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, His Excellency Mr. Robert Mugabe, and to invite him to address the Assembly. President MUGABE: Allow me to begin by congratulating you, Your Excellency Ambassador Samuel Insanally of the Republic of Guyana, upon your election to the presidency of the General Assembly for this forty-eighth session. Your well-known diplomatic skills and your countrys long-established positions of principle augur well for the successful conduct of the work of this session. I also wish to pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria for the able manner in which he steered the work of the Assembly during a particularly challenging forty-seventh session. The admission of new States to the community of nations upholds the principle of universality that we so much cherish. In this connection, it is important for us to take note of and applaud the historic agreement that has been signed by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which heralds a period of peace after more than four decades of bitter and destructive fighting. It is our hope that one day the State of Palestine will earn its deserved place as a Member of this Organization. We would, at the same time, like to pay tribute to those countries and organizations that were instrumental in bringing the negotiations to a fruitful conclusion. The fact that the membership of this Organization has increased dramatically to 184 surely suggests an urgent need to restructure it so that it serves the world community better in the vastly changed circumstances. The end of the cold- war era has finally placed the United Nations at centre stage of international affairs for the maintenance of peace and This record is subject to correction. Corrections should be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned within one week of the date of publication to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Section, Room C-178, and incorporated in a copy of the record. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum. (E) Distr. GENERAL 8 October 1993 ENGLISH 2 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session security and the strengthening of international cooperation in social and economic development. However, the arrangements made for the maintenance of international peace and security need a thorough review. At a time when great emphasis is being placed on the principle of democracy at the national level, there is no valid reason for not extending the same principle to the sphere of international relations. subject, of course, to membership that is democratically elected and fully accountable to the total membership of the Organization on whose behalf the Security Council acts. It will take time to negotiate and put the changes in place. However, in the intervening period there is nothing to prevent the Organization from implementing interim measures which may go some distance towards redressing the present discrepancies. It The principle of sovereign equality among States is an important provision of the Charter. The General Assembly and its style of work represent the embodiment of this important principle. is the only organ that enjoys universality of membership; therefore, its relationship with other organs of the Organization should reflect this pre- eminent status. Consequently, in the revitalization and restructuring process, be a reinvigorated General Assembly capable of asserting itself in its relationship with other organs of the United Nations. the end product should The Security Council is assigned by the Charter the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. The recent proliferation of situations of conflict, instability and tension around the globe calls for greater participation and involvement of the general membership in the workings of the Council. There is therefore need to adjust its membership, structure and methods of work to reflect the changes which have occurred in international relations since 1945. The first obvious change in our Organization is the dramatic increase in its membership. Consequently, the ratio between the General Assembly and the Security Council has progressively declined from 5 to 1 in 1945, through 8 to 1 in 1965, to 12 to 1 in 1993. Clearly, the Security Council has become less representative and needs to be enlarged. The second change relates to the configuration of power in political, economic and military terms which created the notion of permanent membership and the veto in the Council. Present realities dictate that the privileges enjoyed by the permanent members of the Security Council be modified and that the composition of the Council be altered, but with due regard to the provisions of Article 23, paragraph, 1 of the Charter, which accords due importance to \"the contribution of Members of the United Nations to the maintenance of international peace and security and to the other purposes of the Organization\", The mere expansion of the membership of the Security Council will not amount to much for Africa, Latin America and Asia unless the question of equitable geographic distribution is adequately addressed. At present, these three regions are grossly underrepresented, in terms of both non- permanent and permanent members. Africa and Latin America do not even wield a single veto, whereas the Group of Western European and Other States, and Eastern Europe, now wield four of the five vetoes in the Council. Moreover, the Group of Western European and Other States, and Eastern Europe, are allocated 7 of the 15 seats, leaving Africa, Asia and Latin America to share the remaining 8, an arrangement totally inequitable and therefore unacceptable. that is It is clear that the Security Council, through a liberal interpretation of the concept of international peace and security, has encroached on the jurisdiction of other organs in the system. We are concerned by the apparent impression often created by the Council that majority votes in the Council constitute international the provisions of the Charter and other relevant international statutes. regardless of law, The Security Council acts on behalf of the entire United Nations membership. Therefore, any tendencies or practices that may be interpreted as contradicting the norms and principles of transparency, accountability and democracy should be avoided. To this end, we should evolve a system that would ensure more participation by interested Member States that are not members of the Security Council. This will make it possible for such Members to have a meaningful the Security Council. It is also desirable that the Council keep the general membership well informed regarding the stage and nature of discussions and negotiations undertaken. input during the informal meetings of If we have addressed ourselves at some length to the issue of the Security Council it is because the responsibilities it shoulders have manifestly increased in number and complexity. It is our view that only through a process of internal institutional reform, which we believe is long overdue, can the moral authority and effectiveness of the Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 3 Security Council in discharging its mandate be enhanced and acknowledged. It is our hope that the current negotiations on this matter will be successfully concluded to coincide with the celebrations marking the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations in 1995. I now turn to the vital role of the Assembly as the central and universal forum for deliberation. Africa fully supports the efforts under way to revitalize and rationalize the work of the General Assembly. We believe that the exercise must be comprehensive, taking into account the expanded membership of the world body as well as the principle of sovereign equality of all States. The reform process must also fully address the need for the other principal organs of the United Nations system to report to the General Assembly, as provided in the Charter. As I have already noted, the tasks facing the United Nations today have increased with the unprecedented mushrooming of peace-keeping operations all over the world. Bitter armed conflicts continue to ravage lives and destroy property, stretching the much-needed administrative and financial resources of the Organization to the limit. Let us therefore redouble our efforts in support of the increased commitment and responsibilities of our Organization. is in this context in resolving conflicts, The recent successes of the United Nations in bringing peace to Cambodia, El Salvador and Haiti and in facilitating the referendum in Eritrea are testimony to what can be achieved by our Organization acting in a concerted manner. It that we particularly welcome the Secretary-Generals proposals in his report \"An Agenda for Peace\", relating to cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations in peacemaking as well as peace building. We in Africa have taken a positive step in this direction. At the thirtieth summit meeting of the Organization of Africa Unity (OAU), held at Cairo in June this year, we adopted a mechanism whose primary objective is the anticipation and prevention of conflicts. Its mandate will be guided by the principles of the OAU Charter, in particular the sovereign equality of States. Where conflicts have already occurred, the function of this mechanism will be peacemaking and peace building. Even with our meagre resources, we are proud to say that Africa has already established a Special Fund to support OAU activities in conflict prevention and settlement. In southern Africa we continue to be bedeviled by conflicts in Angola, Mozambique and South Africa. In Mozambique, however, we welcome the recent talks between President Chissano and RENAMO leader Afondo Dhlakama, which have cleared some of the major obstacles to the peace process. We therefore urge the United Nations to continue its efforts to put the peace process back on schedule to enable elections to be held in October 1994. In Angola we are gravely concerned at the continued escalation of fighting between UNITA and the legitimate MPLA Government. This has caused untold loss of life and property. We believe that the efforts of the United Nations and the OAU should be aimed at achieving a cease-fire between the two warring parties and creating favourable circumstances for the deployment of United Nations peace- keeping operations while negotiations for peace take place. UNITA should accept the results of the September 1992 democratic elections, which were declared free and fair by international observers, including the United Nations. On South Africa, we applaud and support the current negotiations to bring about democratic change in that country, particularly the recent agreement regarding the future, and indeed ongoing, establishment of the Transitional Executive Council. We are, however, dismayed to note the intensification of violence and the withdrawal of the Inkatha Freedom Party and the white conservatives from the negotiations. These actions threaten the smooth progress towards the goal of democratic elections currently set for April 1994. We therefore urge the two parties to return to the negotiating table, as this is the only way forward. The United Nations should also seriously consider a more active role in the prevention of violence. The President of the African National Congress (ANC) has appealed to the United Nations for the ending of sanctions against South Africa, and we are glad that there has been response from a number of countries to that appeal. Zimbabwe fully supports the appeal, and we are glad that a stage has now been reached when we can judge the process to be more or less irreversible. In Somalia we commend the efforts of the United Nations in the difficult mission to restore normalcy to that tortured country. In Liberia and Rwanda, while peace has remained elusive, we are glad that current OAU and United Nations efforts to resolve the crises have begun to bear fruit. It is our hope that recent positive developments on the long- standing question of Western Sahara will result in a just and equitable settlement. The untiring efforts of the Secretary- General and the United Nations in seeking lasting solutions to these and elsewhere, particularly those emanating from the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia and Soviet Union, deserve our unqualified support. conflicts on our continent 4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session As equal members of this family of nations, we believe that peace-keeping, peace-building and peacemaking must not be the preserve of a few economically or politically powerful countries. We stand ready to cooperate with the international community in seeking solutions to the many problems facing the world today, by participating in peace- keeping operations or mediation efforts, or by providing any facilities or expertise at our disposal. However, unless all Member States commit themselves to timely payments of their assessed contributions for these efforts, some countries will find continued participation difficult. We are fully aware that issues involving violent disputes or armed conflicts are not the only concerns of the international community. Other issues, such as trade and economic growth, as well as international cooperation for development, are matters of primary concern. We note with concern from the World Economic Survey, 1993 that for the third year in succession the rate of growth of world output in 1993 will be below that of world population. It is also evident from the Survey that the end of the East-West ideological divide has not brought with it a commensurate narrowing of the economic disparities between North and South. these disparities have become more pronounced than ever before. Instead, The problems confronting the developing countries today are manifold. Terms of trade continue to deteriorate, as high prices of imported manufactured goods and rising protectionism in developed countries become the order of the day. The socio-economic crisis in the developing countries has been further exacerbated by the crippling burden of debt. The flows of official development assistance, upon which they are dependent, has declined in recent years, while direct investment has constituted only a marginal percentage of all inflows to these countries, particularly those in Africa. In Africa, the least developed and most marginalized of all the majority of countries are the worlds regions, undertaking economic reform measures. They have made great sacrifices and encountered untold difficulties in implementing these reforms. In southern and eastern Africa in particular, the capacity to implement and keep these economic reforms on course was further undermined by the devastating drought which swept the region in 1991-1992. Yet these countries have continued to demonstrate their commitment to the reforms aimed at improving the standard of living of their people. Our sacrifices alone are not enough to ensure the success of our economic reform programmes. In this regard, we must once again reiterate the imperative need for an open and equitable international trading system and the provision of adequate financial resources. We therefore call for an early conclusion of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). We also call again on the developed countries to achieve without further delay the target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance that was set over 24 years ago by this very Assembly. Africas economic and social progress in general, and in the context of the implementation of the New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s in particular, will remain severely hampered as long as the continents debt burden continues to be as acute as it is today. Standing at close to $290 billion at the end of 1992, the continents debt is equivalent to 100.1 per cent of its gross national product, while it is an alarming 108 per cent for sub-Saharan Africa. With Africa continuing to be a net exporter of financial resources, that many of our human development needs and social services have gone unmet? is it any wonder We believe that there is a clear and compelling need to find a lasting solution to Africas indebtedness. While we welcome some of the positive steps taken by some creditor countries towards debt relief, as well as the important initiatives of the Bretton Woods institutions in this regard, we believe that an unacceptable gap still remains between rhetoric and action, and that more decisive measures can be taken to address this crisis. is primarily our Africa believes that the commitment it made together with the international community, when the New Agenda was adopted in 1991, must be renewed and translated into concrete action. Fully cognizant of the fact that Africas responsibility, we have development proceeded courageously to implement our side of the commitment, particularly in the promotion of regional and sub-regional economic cooperation and integration and the for creation of an enabling environment foreign and domestic therefore call upon the international community to buttress our efforts by addressing in a concerted manner the major constraints which I have highlighted. investment. We Africa does not seek charity. Mindful of the need to promote sustainable and self-sustaining development on the basis of self-reliance and the interdependence of Member States, the countries of Southern Africa signed in August 1992 a regional treaty establishing the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC). Foremost among our regional objectives achievement - through are the Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 5 the integration - of development and economic growth, alleviation of poverty, the enhancement of the standard and quality of life and the support of the socially disadvantaged. Through the various regional economic organizations such as the Eastern and Southern African Preferential Trade Area (PTA), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and the Arab Maghreb Union, African countries are trying to further their aim of achieving self- sustaining development. These efforts will eventually culminate in the formation of an African Economic Community, whose foundations have already been laid. Furthermore, it is our objective to evolve common political values, systems and institutions, and to promote and defend peace and security in the region. It is our earnest hope that the international community as well as organs of the United Nations system and the multilateral financial institutions will continue to render their invaluable and generous assistance in order to ensure the success of our regional integration efforts. Zimbabwe is fully committed to achieving the sustainable utilization of our natural resources and the protection of our environment in order to attain sustainable development. In this context, we note with appreciation the progress made so far in establishing the institutional mechanism for the follow-up of the decisions taken during the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June last year. In particular, we commend the Commission on Sustainable Development for the constructive and positive manner in which it conducted its work during its first substantive session in June. of the areas We welcome the stress that the Commission has placed on some successful implementation of Agenda 21, including the urgent need to support national efforts to achieve sustainable consumption and production patterns and lifestyles and the need for a supportive international economic environment. critical to the Issues such as the alleviation and reduction of poverty, the creation of remunerative and productive employment and social integration are at the core of the endeavours of all countries, but more urgently of developing countries. It is appropriate that these constitute the basis of our deliberations when we convene in Copenhagen, Denmark, in March 1995 for the World Summit for Social Development. severally. The theme of social integration, for example, was addressed in a special way when two years ago we held a summit meeting on children here in New York. We adopted principles and guidelines which should govern the treatment and development of children in all our countries. We should, in translating these principles into practice, work to remove the status and stigma of societys marginal people from our children. The children are our future. We have a duty to the future for them by the positive and practical measures we take today for their protection, education and development. Of great importance to us also are issues of population In this context we and the advancement of women. the World welcome convening of Conference on Population and Development in 1994 in Cairo, Egypt, and of the World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, in 1995. and support the In this regard let me underscore the conclusion of the World Economic Survey 1993 that the social concerns of developing countries, and the major issues of development in other areas of the world, cannot be resolved in the absence of world economic growth. It is our fervent hope that just as the United Nations has considerably strengthened its role in the political and humanitarian fields, its role in the economic, likewise be strengthened in order adequately to meet the emerging new realities and their impact on the developing countries. social and related fields will Let me conclude by calling upon all Member States to remember that just as the new international situation dictates the need to strengthen, democratize and streamline the operations of the United Nations and its constituent bodies, so also is it incumbent upon us to make an exceptional contribution in pursuit of the noble goals of justice, peace and development. This we believe can be achieved only if all Members live up to their obligations under the Charter. The PRESIDENT: the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe for the statement he has just made. On behalf of Mr. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall. Mrs. Fritsche (Liechtenstein), Vice-President, took the Chair. These themes are all equally vital. It is gratifying that the international community has pronounced itself on them on many occasions as indeed have States individually and ADDRESS BY MR. FRANJO TUDJMAN, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA 6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session The PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an address by the President of the Republic of Croatia. Mr. Franjo Tudjman, President of the Republic of Croatia, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall. On behalf of The PRESIDENT: the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic of Croatia, His Excellency Mr. Franjo Tudjman, and to invite him to address the Assembly. President TUDJMAN (spoke in Croatian; English text furnished by the delegation): Throughout the half century of its history the United Nations has never rallied a greater number of Member States and has never played a more prominent role in global and regional international relations, than it does today, and it has never borne the brunt of such problems as it bears today. This, the forty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly, is being held in an atmosphere of great hope and of even greater commitments facing the Organization which, in this post-cold-war time, following the historical collapse of communism and multinational State communities in Europe, is becoming the cardinal guardian of global peace and security. are required and possible The fall of Soviet and other European Communist and totalitarian systems has reinforced hope and provided the prerequisites for the comprehensive democratization of the world while simultaneously raising the question of what kind of multilateralism is in the contemporary world. Of no lesser importance is the question of the new role of the United Nations at a time when many new States coming into being and when the strengthening of global peace is becoming the fundamental ideology of mankind. The United Nations must shoulder the responsibility for a more equitable global order to take hold in every corner of the world. But, in order to achieve this goal, one must thoroughly review multilateral mechanisms as well as the activity of international organizations under conditions of the emergence of many new States, the end of bipolarity and the strengthening of the polycentric foundation of the world. The process of disintegration of the Soviet communist system, which began with the fall of the Berlin Wall, led towards a fundamental shift in relations, not only within Europe, but also on a global scale. It has redirected and drafted new American-Russian and American-European relations. The competitive wars of the great Powers bent on gaining influence and predominance in the Third World have almost died away, but the focus of regional crises has now the former Soviet Union, because of moved to Eastern and South-Eastern Europe and to the area of the profound political, national, social and economic changes sweeping those areas. International factors, primarily West European and North American countries, were taken unawares by the depth and speed of these historical changes. Their initial disorientation turned, subsequently, into a renewal of dormant traditional competition for spheres of influence in changing circumstances. On the international scene, the ultimate result has been disunity and the inefficiency of the most responsible international factors in dealing with volatile regional crises, but such developments have also jeopardized the European integration processes already under way. The fundamental values and goals of European regional organizations now face a serious test and a radical review of their mission. The new system of European collective security is yet to take hold, and the same holds true for the system of general, global security. This is a matter of the greatest importance because the security of small countries has become the key to the stability of each region and of the overall international system. international The world has been slow to accept, and slower to understand, the changes involving the national and State emancipation of old and new European and Asian nations, and it has recognized their identity with reluctance. The world has found it hard to grasp the at-first untenable contradiction implied in the fact that we have entered a period, in the development of human society and international national individualization comprehensive civilizational integration. Even worse, the world has not been ready to face the difficulties and the temporarily destabilizing consequences of such changes, which will ultimately lead to the full democratization of international relations. relations, based of on broadest the a most The view that the collapse of communist systems and of Soviet domination over nations in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe had resolved the problem of regional and international stability was wrong. There was a similar lack of understanding of the fact that the process of internal and international democratization cannot stop at the mere democratization of political systems, and that it also inevitably leads to the disintegration of multinational State formations. This was the logical sequence of political democratization and national emancipation. There can no longer be any doubt today about the fact that the ever-increasing functional integration of the world was the very prerequisite of national independence and internal sociopolitical and international democratization. Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 7 This has only seemingly been a contradictory process. Specifically, because of their endangered position, small nations and their States are anxious to preserve their own State, cultural and economic identity, and this sustains not only the variety but also the very development of the world. It should be remembered that positive nationalism, that is, the national-democratic movement of oppressed nations in Eastern Europe and of oppressed stateless nations in other parts of the world, deserves the greatest credit for the collapse of the communist systems. Having achieved their national sovereignty and the independence of their State, small nations, in their own interest, became supporters of \"civilizational\" integration and democratization. This is the reason why one of the most important goals of the international community today should be the successful resolution of problems affecting complete regional and international integration of States having emerged after the disintegration of communist systems in former multinational States such as the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. The new world order which is being created so laboriously, but also of necessity, can no longer be based only on the ascendancy of the anti-fascist coalition or of the nuclear Power club. Half a century after the historic victory over fascism, new economic and political realities have come into being, and the countries against which the anti-fascist alliance was directed cannot bear the liability of the past indefinitely. Germany, Japan, Italy and the countries within their international political spheres during the Second World War are today democratic countries with huge developmental power, which is also obviously beneficial to the world. Similarly, the fundamental political and other eventful changes taking place in Russia are transforming that country, currently in the throes of dramatic upheaval, from a former Stalinist threat to international peace and order into, we hope, a constructive component of global order built on new foundations of equality and partnership of nations and States for the sake of mutual benefit and the stability of peace. The balance of military blocs, weapons and ideologies established during the cold war was only seemingly a stable system, because it was actually founded on repression or dependency, first of all at the expense of small States or stateless nations. Today, to quote Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the democracy of international Times, 20 August 1993, p. A29, \"Dont Make the U.N.s Hard Job Harder\") \"Multilateralism is (The New York society.\" Multilateralism, certainly! But of what kind? We must tend towards a multilateralism that will help us - after a gory history of strife, first between dynasties, then between States and, finally, between imperialist or ideological-military blocs - to avoid war between incompatible civilizations. A brutal entanglement of these civilizational contrasts is taking place precisely in the area of the former Yugoslavia, threatening to polarize greater areas along the lines of separation and conflict between civilizational-religious blocs. We should tend, instead, to internal, regional and global relations in which these civilizational spheres will blend productively and reinforce their identity through peaceful competition, instead of wasting their precious potential on mutual confrontation and annihilation. A new multilateralism capable of coping with the epoch-making changes of our time also calls for a thorough reform of the United Nations. This implies, primarily, the strengthening of international law, but also the development of mechanisms which will help the United Nations and its agencies to function more effectively and to be depoliticized, less costly and more receptive to ideas, influences and supervision. In particular, the role and responsibility of the Security Council in dealing with questions concerning international peace and stability should be given greater emphasis. Over past years there has been considerable progress in the operation of the Security Council, and the use of the veto has almost become obsolete. Nevertheless, certain Security Council decisions are still excessively influenced by the national interests of its members, the permanent ones in particular. Accordingly, we need a climate of cooperation in the Security Council that will prevent its being used as an extended instrument of the foreign policy of individual Security Council members. of the Croatia supports extension permanent membership of the Security Council, which will reflect the economic and political realities of the present-day world and assure a balanced regional representation in the Council. Croatia also endorses the limitation of the right and practice of veto. The major crises of our time, such as the one in the area of the former Yugoslavia, should be used as precious lessons for more effective and concerted action by the Security Council. We also believe that a high degree of responsibility and authority in decisions concerning the major directions of global economic and social development should also be vested in the Economic and Social Council, so that its 8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session decisions, in specific areas of decision-making, would have executive force similar to that of Security Council decisions. Although it would be difficult to envisage the General Assembly assuming the role of a global parliament to the detriment of the sovereignty of Member States, a clearer delimitation of authority among the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council would nevertheless be required. A more articulated link with United Nations agencies, which ought to improve their efficiency and prevent the political blocking of certain processes, is also necessary. However, the enhanced role of the Security Council, which we are advocating, should not affect the authority of the General Assembly, which is a forum for the manifestation of the views of the vast majority of small countries Members of the United Nations. As a form of present-day democracy, multilateralism should provide the foundation for the stability of the new and, in every respect, democratic world order. However, while striving to turn our global Organization into a most consonant orchestra which will provide for the full expression of the voices of all differences and contrasts, natural-permanent and secondary-provisional ones alike, we sight of uncontroverted historical must never experience - namely, the responsibility, of the small and the greatest components and lines of force in international life are not and cannot be identical throughout all events, times and circumstances. Because of this we should continue to build global organization on the efficient activity of the Security Council and, within it, on the role and responsibility of its permanent members. hence, and, lose role that the The central point with reference to the efficient role of the Security Council, and of the entire United Nations, is the need to develop a new foundation for peace mediation. Established in cold-war times, the mechanism was adjusted to the need to prevent the outbreak and spread of conflict between the blocs, or between their dependants in the third world, with long-term freezing of conflict as the goal. Today peace mediation requires a much more active and flexible approach, first of all because of the need and possibility of preventive action, but also because of a selective use of force in the implementation of peace agreements and Security Council decisions. The example of my country, the Republic of Croatia, and that of the neighbouring Republic and Herzegovina pinpointed most exactly the two fundamental weaknesses of the existing peace-keeping-force model and mandate. First, the classic mandate, the freezing of the conflict by sustaining a cease-fire, does not resolve the conflict but, rather, creates further complications. Second, as has become manifest, of Bosnia forces engaged in the certain countries whose implementation of the multilateral peace mandate are trying, through the members of their peace-keeping units and negotiation mediators, to pursue their national policies and not the policy of the Security Council. are The reform of the overall peace-operation mechanism requires, first and foremost, a more efficient use of coordinated instruments of diplomatic, economic, political and military pressure and consistency in the implementation of the peace-keeping-force mandate. Such an approach, which also implies the selective use of force, not only could have prevented the escalation of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia but also reduced peace-keeping-forces casualties to fewer than have actually been the case with the present static mandate, which does not offer adequate protection even to the peace-keeping force itself. has been and in the conduct acquired prepared operations in Croatia, Bosnia In recent years extensive positive, but also negative, of experience peace-keeping and Herzegovina, Somalia and Cambodia. It has been found that peace-keeping forces should be more qualified and better trained and equipped for special missions in each peace- keeping operation. The United Nations should also have greater authority in the sensitive conduct of peace-keeping operations. This suggests the need for the establishment of already well-trained national military contingents to be available, with all their facilities, to the global community. Under the current system, in the best of cases several months are required for unit selection and the provision of necessary facilities for the deployment of peace-keeping forces in specific areas, which results in delayed action and substantially affects the conditions of peace-keeping-mandate implementation. It has also become evident regional military alliances and systems in particular, can in the majority of cases be the main and most efficient mechanism to implement Peace-keeping operations are being used at an ever-increasing rate to prevent disastrous humanitarian situations or to alleviate their consequences, but they will still have a role to play in political mediation and organization of the basic State institutions, as well as in supervising political and economic reconstruction in the initial period. Such United Nations operations of an increasingly more comprehensive scope call for the cooperation of the entire international community in the implementation of regularly highly complex missions. The international community must act through the Security Council whenever there is obvious aggression against a Member State, as well as in cases where international security is seriously threatened. Selective interventionism regional organizations, peace-keeping operations. that Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 9 mainly has an adverse effect on the reputation and credibility of the United Nations. of and pressure international Economic sanctions are becoming, at an ever-increasing rate, an instrument of international pressure in the absence of political will to use stronger means to implement Security Council resolutions or to protect basic interests of Member States and promote international law standards. In our view, sanctions can have an effect only if combined with other instruments isolation. However, what is also required is a more efficient system of compensating those countries which subsequently have to bear, with no guilt on their part, the burden of sanctions against specific regimes. A more effective system is also needed to supervise the implementation of sanctions through the enforcement of \"sanctions imposed for violations of sanctions\". In the opposite case, the sanctions, to be sure, will have a long-term effect, but before the ultimate objective is achieved the highest price will be paid by the innocent population of the affected country, by people who cannot deal by themselves with the internationally censured regime. the punishment of law and the protection of The democratization of international relations and a new multilateralism also imply a greater commitment of the international community to the safeguarding and respect of the violators of human rights, humanitarian and war the ecological balance of the planet. Although we uphold the view that the defence of cardinal rights and international law standards cannot take precedence over the sovereignty of United Nations Member States, regimes and individuals that violate such rights and standards may not be allowed to hide behind the principle of \"non-interference with internal matters of countries\". in reconciling the two approaches, and the ways in which, and conditions under which, international mechanisms can be set in motion ought to be codified in the safeguarding of universal human rights and interests in order to preserve peace and the international order. Balance should be sought territory - Because of its own experience - the orchestrated military revolt of part of the Serbian population organized from Belgrade, resulting in the occupation of one quarter of Croatias the Republic of Croatia supports cooperation with the international community in the identification and incorporation of the highest standards of protection of the Serbian minority into Croatian legislation. We accept international supervision of their implementation in reconciliation, confidence-building and the future stability of the country and the greater area. inter-ethnic interest the of Of course, the responsibility which the United Nations should assume at an ever-increasing rate in crisis areas, relief operations, protection of the environment and assurance of balanced development, as well as in other issues of general interest, requires vast financial resources. It is not surprising, therefore, that the regular budget and the financing of peace-keeping operations have assumed such key importance among the matters to be discussed at this, the forty-eighth, session of the General Assembly. Part of these outlays can be reduced by a more economical use of existing resources and by improving the efficiency of the United Nations system itself. We should prevent United Nations actions from becoming an end in themselves, and avenues greater programming coordination with other organizations and initiatives within the international system. Greater care ought to be exercised in preventing all instances of abuse and corruption within the United Nations system, because they not only increase the cost but also undermine the reputation of the global Organization. explored towards should also be the international order The global community is saddled with many adversities and crises, but is nevertheless becoming more and more settled. We are encouraged by the fact that, after half a century of Israeli-Arab conflict, the way has finally been paved towards more stable peace in the Middle East. This example can also be instructive with regard to the solution of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. It demonstrates the practical use and advantage of carefully worded agreements which are possible especially when their resolution actively involves the leading world power as well. Such cases call on both sides for statesmanship and courage in making concessions for the sake of peace and require realism in the assessment of national interests with regard to objective international circumstances and the particular historical moment. The statesmen involved, and the responsible officers of the global Organization, are expected to be reasonable and principled, determined but also moderate, in a way allowing for no narrow-minded radicalism, but tending rather to seek the most favourable solution for the protection of peace and the international order. We are also encouraged to see that conditions are being established for the withdrawal of the peace-keeping forces from Cambodia early next year. This gives us hope that a similar process will also be completed in the Republic of Croatia in the immediate future, and in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the nearest possible future. We welcome the evident progress attained in the transfer of power to the black majority in the South African 10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session Republic. We hope that the sporadic cases of racial and political violence in that country are only aftershocks following the major political shifts towards racial tolerance and democratization of political life in that country. We are convinced that the international community will also find the means to succeed in the already initiated and then halted process of political stabilization in Angola and Mozambique. We also believe that resoluteness of the United Nations is also required in the area of the former Yugoslavia, just as it has been in Somalia, in terms of selective use of force, protection of the peace force and assurance of relief. But in Somalia as well, the international community must also assume broader responsibilities in the restoration of the basic functions of the State and in the establishment of law and order in that country. It is obvious that differences in the approach to the solution of problems which frustrate the efficiency of from operative but from political reasons. the peace-keeping forces stem not The Republic of Croatia welcomes the efforts of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the European Community and the United Nations to mediate peace in the conflicts between or within the former Soviet republics, and we express our readiness to take part in these peace efforts. Fortified by its own experience, Croatia will be ready, especially after the end of the war in the Republic, to contribute even more to the new mission of peace-keeping operations throughout the world. As a country of outstanding natural attractions, but also of a very vulnerable environmental system, the Republic of Croatia will consistently implement the commitments of the Action Plan - Agenda 21 - the conclusions of the Conference on the Environment and Development and the Rio declarations. Croatia believes that support of the programme of is the proper way towards the sustainable development gradual bridging of the growing developmental gap between the North and the South, which is a permanent source of political and social instability and ecological imbalance in specific areas and in the world as a whole. The crisis in the area of the former Yugoslavia is the most difficult crisis in the world today, and it cannot be resolved without a more determined role on the part of the international community. Past mediation efforts have been shown to be insufficient because they were limited by a mandate lacking firmness, but also rendered more difficult by the diverse political interests of individual external forces. It has not been sufficient to try to freeze the conflict, send thus in humanitarian aid and engage in empty threats, allowing the crisis to deteriorate to the point where \"everybody would get tired of waging war\" and then agree to a political settlement. The initial aggression of the Yugoslav communist army, Serbia and Montenegro, for the conquest of Croat and Muslim territories was not countered by determined steps, and the consequences of such a policy have been disastrous. They have included first and foremost the terrible destruction and \"ethnic cleansing\" in areas conquered by the Serbs, and then the extension of the conflict to the Muslim and Croat sides as well, the struggle for the remaining territory, the incessant growth of the death toll, and the ever swelling tide of refugees, which has now exceeded the figure of one million agonized men, women and children. the expense of In the Republic of Croatia the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) mandate achieved certain initial results in putting a stop to fighting and providing for the withdrawal of the Yugoslav army. However, the mandate has been misused by the Serbian extremist insurgents and their promoters, the Belgrade expansionists, to freeze territorial gains, continue \"ethnic cleansing,\" and consolidate occupation which has assumed forms of terrorism even at the local Serbian population. The international community has allowed the Serbian side to completely ignore all Security Council resolutions and other agreements, in spite of the fact that the modalities of resolving the conflict have been clearly and well defined: complete cease-fire and the disarmament of Serbian paramilitary units; the return of all refugees and displaced persons to their homes; the normalization of traffic and supply; the guarantee of extensive ethnic rights to the Serbian minority within the scope of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia; the gradual reinstatement of Croatian authorities and of law and order in the occupied areas; confidence-building measures; scheduling of elections for local self-government authorities; and general amnesty for all persons not found guilty of war crimes. Owing to the lack of determination on the part of the international community in the implementation of the UNPROFOR mandate, the Republic of Croatia has found itself, through no fault of its own, in a position where pressure is being brought to bear on it, including even threats of sanctions, because it is trying to deal with its vital communications problems, or prevent Croatian towns from being shelled from areas under the peace-keeping forces. Thus, Croatia is being taken to task for reinstating civilian traffic across the Maslenica Strait, on which a million people in southern Croatia and parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina depend. Croatia is first urged to the protection of Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 11 negotiate and normalize relations with Belgrade, and then accused of doing so. Meanwhile, nothing efficient is being done to disarm Serbian paramilitary units and to prevent Serbian extremism and terrorism in the United Nations protected areas. the most comprehensive rights One of the basic concepts of our policy has been the guarantee of for all minorities - including of course the Serbian minority as a whole, and particularly in the areas of Croatia in which the Serbs constituted a majority before the war - in the interest of the future permanent stability of the Croatian State and of its role within the international order. However, at the same time the Serbian insurgents must provide for the return of hundreds of thousands of displaced Croats and other non-Serbian citizens to their homes in the areas under the protection of the peace-keeping forces. Belgrade must finally recognize the Republic of Croatia and its borders, as the whole world has already done. Croatia cannot tolerate a situation in which the Serbian minority abuses its rights in order to break up the Croatian State or to create the legal framework for local self-government and their annexation to the \"federation of Serbian lands\". This would mean the realization of the Greater Serbia idea, which was precisely the underlying motive of the present war against Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro must remain in force until peace is achieved in Croatia, too, and not only in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as is also provided for by the respective Security Council resolutions. Croatia resolutely urges the consistent and effective implementation of all Security Council resolutions - no more, but no less either. the secession of territories under Croatia has shown extreme patience within the scope of endeavours for a peaceful settlement of the conflict with the Serbian minority, orchestrated during the time the former socialist Yugoslavia was disintegrating and the democratic State of Croatia was being established. However, Croatia cannot tolerate indefinitely the occupation of its territories, the pressure of the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons from Croatian areas, and a situation in which the State is split. Croatia can no longer be forced to accept the fourth extension of the UNPROFOR mandate if the mission of the peace-keeping forces is not specified in more resolute terms, and if the Serbs are not given an ultimatum to implement the Vance Plan and all relevant Security Council resolutions. The means used to bring about Serbian withdrawal from Igman and Bjelasnica - military strikes - must also be applied in Croatia. the relevant The Republic of Croatia is not pleased with the latest report of the United Nations Secretary-General, which suggests the extension of the UNPROFOR mandate in Croatia by six months, with no essential changes in respect of the present mandate. If the UNPROFOR mandate is not amended within the next 48 hours to ensure energetic implementation of resolutions and other documents of the Security Council, the Republic of Croatia will be forced to renounce the United Nations peace-keeping operation on its territory and to request units to abandon Croatia not later than 30 November 1993. Maintenance of the status quo, which is nothing but the occupation of part of Croatian territory, and the inefficiency of UNPROFOR are detrimental to the sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia and to the normalization of its economic and overall life. Croatia is prepared to resolve the key problem of its existence by all necessary means and at any cost - by negotiated agreement and settlement if necessary, by resort to legitimate means of restoring law and order, with full observance of laws governing war and humanitarian affairs, in areas currently suffering the anarchy of Serbian terrorist and paramilitary troops. if possible, but, Croatia is grateful circumstances. in the area of With its involvement the former Yugoslavia, UNPROFOR has borne a great burden and has suffered considerable casualties, operating in extremely difficult to all UNPROFOR members who have performed their duty bravely and honourably, risking their personal safety and their lives, and helping thousands of suffering people. Croatia does not oppose UNPROFOR, but it can no longer tolerate the consequences of the Forces inefficiency and its persistent circumventing of relevant Security Council resolutions. The implementation of these provisions will affect not only the existence of the Republic of Croatia but also the basic credibility of the United Nations. By renouncing the UNPROFOR mandate, Croatia does not close its doors to any humanitarian action or to the possibility of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) operation in the former Yugoslavia. On the contrary, Croatia welcomes the readiness of NATO to assume the role of principal guarantor of peace and stability in this part of Europe, in the implementation of the peace settlement. We also look forward to seeing NATO involved in the implementation of the Vance plan. At the same time, Croatias door is being opened wide to all relief and human rights organizations, European Community monitors and UNPROFOR civilian logistic personnel engaged in the provision of relief to the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. actively support and will its units 12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session I refer factors - International to the European Community and the United Nations - have brought the negotiations on resolutions of the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina to the settlement currently proposed. It should be remembered that the Republic of Croatia and the Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina were the first to support all serious peace plans put forward by the international community. However, the indecision and inconsistency of the international community have allowed both the Serbian and the Muslim representatives to reject or to flout these plans. Even the proclamation of independence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina would have been impossible without the agreement of the Croats, expressed through the 1992 referendum. Without the resistance put up by the Croats, no part of Bosnia and Herzegovina would have been defended, from Serbian aggression. We were the first to recognize the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the first to send an ambassador to Sarajevo. The Republic of Croatia has contributed more to the defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to the care of Bosnian refugees, than have all other countries combined, and that situation continues despite the aggression waged by the Muslim army against Croatian populated areas in central Bosnia and against territory envisaged for the Croatian Republic within the Union of Republics of Bosnia and Herzegovina. in the beginning, In view of past developments, there are no longer any completely equitable and clear-cut solutions to the complex Bosnian crisis. If peace is to be achieved, all the parties must accept political and territorial compromise. The Croats in Bosnia have made major concessions for the sake of peace. They have lost the most, especially in Posavina and Central Bosnia, where the majority of the Croatian population used to live. They have agreed to accept 18 per cent of territory although the previous Vance-Owen plan envisaged a share of about 27 per cent. Indeed, for strategic, political and psychological reasons, the Croatian side cannot agree to any further concessions. It should be remembered that in 1948 the Croats accounted for 23.9 per cent of the Bosnian population. That proportion declined as a result of the pressure of the hegemonistic policies of the Serbs and then of the Muslims. In the search for a solution, the same principles must be applied throughout. One might ask, for instance, why Mostar, along with Sarajevo, is being singled out for European Community supervision. Why not Banja Luka and Zenica or Vare, where the Croatian population is struggling for survival? the Croats who lived there for centuries? What about the fact that, as a result of Serbian and then Muslim aggression, two thirds of Catholic parishes in Bosnia and Herzegovina have been occupied or completely cleansed of The international community must face facts and problems in their entirety. It must identify ways of halting Serbian aggression, but also means of protecting the Croatian people from the attempts of extremists to set up a Bosnian Islamic state, mostly at the expense of the Croats. Nevertheless, I am pleased to report, here and now, that hostilities between the Croat and Serbian sides in Bosnia and Herzegovina have stopped and, in particular, that, on my initiative and with the good offices of Turkey, political agreement has been reached between the Croats and the Muslims concerning the cessation of hostilities and the provision of the prerequisites for permanent peace and cooperation. We believe that the purpose of peace would be served by NATOs energetic assumption of the chief role in implementing the peace plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina and in solving the problem of the United Nations protected areas in Croatia, with the United Nations assuming responsibility for implementation of the peace settlement. token, the Republic of Croatia For geopolitical, historical and economic reasons, as well as for the sake of transport links, the Republic of Croatia is interested in the closest future cooperation with the Union of Republics of Bosnia and Herzegovina. By the same the normalization of relations with all States that emerged following the disintegration of Communist Yugoslavia, on the basis of mutual recognition. This is not only in the interests of is also a prerequisite for the establishment of peace and for the creation of a stable international order in this part of the world. the peoples of these States; supports it The PRESIDENT: the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic of Croatia for the statement he has just made.

ALGIRDAS MYKOLAS BRAZAUSKAS, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA The PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an address by the President of the Republic of Lithuania. Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 13 Mr. Algirdas Mykolas Brazauskas, President of the Republic of Lithuania, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall. On behalf of The PRESIDENT: the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic of Lithuania, His Excellency Mr. Algirdas Mykolas Brazauskas, and to invite him to address the Assembly. ADDRESS BY MR. ALGIRDAS MYKOLAS BRAZAUSKAS, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA The PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an address by the President of the Republic of Lithuania. Mr. Algirdas Mykolas Brazauskas, President of the Republic of Lithuania, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall. On behalf of The PRESIDENT: the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic of Lithuania, His Excellency Mr. Algirdas Mykolas Brazauskas, and to invite him to address the Assembly. President BRAZAUSKAS (spoke in Lithuanian; English text furnished by the delegation): Allow me to congratulate Mr. Insanally on his election as President of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly and to wish him much success in heading this august body. It is a great honour to speak in this historic Hall, in which, as nowhere else, all the victories and concerns of the world, all its problems and opportunities, are concentrated. The voice of Lithuania, which had been muffled for half a century, can now be heard loud and clear throughout the world. Lithuania, with a long tradition of statehood dating back to the thirteenth century, regained its independence through the determination of our people, certain fundamental changes in the world and international support. Our State is consolidating democracy. It respects human and minority rights, and strives to ensure social progress and an improved standard of living founded on free market principles. By participating in the activities of the United Nations and other international organizations, we hope to contribute to a better world. felt and other international organizations. We have an opportunity to voice our concerns and to obtain support not only at the United Nations, but also at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the North Atlantic Cooperation the Council of Europe, Council In establishing friendly relations with other countries, Lithuania has the supportive and increasing influence of international organizations in the process of democratization and in the creation of a free market economy. We trust that the following international Conferences sponsored by the United Nations - the International Conference on Population and Development, for Social Development and the Fourth World Conference on Women - will help us find lasting solutions to these concerns. the World Summit Since parliamentary elections held last autumn the Government in Lithuania has changed. Our chosen course in foreign policy, however, in the tradition of democratic States, has not altered. Our foreign policy priorities remain close cooperation with the other Baltic States of Latvia and Estonia, as well as with the countries of northern Europe, and full integration into Europes political, economic, security and cultural sphere. Lithuania is seeking in particular friendly and mutually beneficial relations with neighbouring Russia, Poland and Belarus. Lithuania supports President Boris Yeltsins efforts to stabilize the political situation in his country and to maintain the course of reform. We are essentially in full agreement with the position of other democratic States regarding recent events in Russia. Like its other neighbours, Lithuania is seeking its place on the new map of Europe, and we hope for closer cooperation between the countries of the Baltic Sea region. An important aspect of such cooperation, and of Lithuanias relations with Russia, relationship with the Kaliningrad region. The gradual demilitarization of that region, the development of a free trade zone there and the increased organizations, especially the European Community, have on its future are in Lithuanias best interest and, we believe, in the interests of other States in the area. international influence is our that In the long term, the shores of the Baltic Sea should be free of armaments. Measures should be taken now to increase trust and security. Our chosen path - a gradual coming together of the nations and States of the Baltic region and good relations between neighbours - should lead us to the European Community and contribute to the consolidation of security on the old continent. 14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session The shortest road from Paris, Berlin and Warsaw to Moscow and St. Petersburg leads through Lithuania. For many centuries, however, the vehicles of war of attacking or retreating armies rolled across these crossroads, bringing with them many misfortunes and tragedies. Today, however, we hope that convoys of goods will roll across our territory. We believe, and are working to ensure, that our complex geopolitical situation in a new Europe - a Europe no longer torn apart by antagonistic ideologies - should become a source of new opportunities, benefits and prosperity. We are inspired by the example of countries such as Denmark, Switzerland, Austria and others, which have successfully taken advantage of similar situations and the opportunities offered by a more unified Europe. Having restored its independence, Lithuania has once again become a participant in the processes of a more unified Europe. Lithuania is receptive to cooperation with the West and the East, and sees future opportunities in such cooperation. Despite the great distances that separate us, relations with the United States have been, and will continue to be, especially significant for Lithuania. We are grateful to the United States for resolutely adhering to the policy of non-recognition of the illegal incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union. A sizeable emigre community, which found refuge in the new world, links our two countries. We value close United States cooperation with Europe, including that with the structures of the CSCE and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and we sincerely wish every success for efforts to stabilize the situation in a changing world and to encourage the progress of post-Communist countries toward democracy and a free market. We turn to the United Nations, asking it to safeguard the interests of small States. The future of a more integrated world lies in democracy and in the individuality of free nations. The international community should be prepared to defend, with force if necessary, the sovereignty of small - even the smallest - nations. During his recent visit to Lithuania, Pope John Paul II stressed that \"the interests of large States should never force small States to become satellites of a foreign Power\". In spite of the conflicts that now plague the world, it is fortunate that some good news also reaches this house in New York. We welcome the peace processes in the Middle East and the positive trends in South Africa, Cambodia, Haiti and El Salvador. On 31 August, in compliance with General Assembly resolution of 1992, the last remaining units of the Russian army were withdrawn from Lithuania. I should like to take this opportunity to thank representatives from all the countries, large and small, that supported our legitimate goal. I should also like to sincerely thank the United Nations and Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who monitored the fulfilment of the obligation to withdraw that army, and who, during the most envoy, Ambassador Tommy Koh, to Vilnius, and Mr. Stoyan Ganev, President of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly, who visited Lithuania and the other Baltic States in July to discuss the armys withdrawal. We were glad when, having made it just in time for the ceremony marking the departure of the last Russian troops, Ambassador Koh said: critical moments, sent his \"My work in Lithuania is done, although some work is waiting for me in the other Baltic States.\" When a large State withdraws its army from a small one without issuing any ultimatums or setting conditions, this signals a new era for the world in which, thanks to international efforts in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, even the most sensitive problems can be solved peacefully. Despite several disagreements that arose at the last minute, calm and balanced diplomacy allowed Lithuania and Russia to reach agreement on this fundamental question. On more than one occasion I had the pleasure of speaking openly and sincerely with President Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation. A fresh page is being turned in the relations between our two countries. Of course, the issue of compensation for damage inflicted during the years of occupation is still on the agenda for negotiations between Lithuania and Russia. The Russian army still remains in Estonia and Latvia. We believe that with the help of the United Nations this international problem will be resolved successfully and, at the same time, the stability of the region will be bolstered. Until people become fully aware of the possibilities that democracy and freedom provide these ideas will remain just that - ideas. After an initial wave of euphoria, disillusion may follow. One can already notice this in some post- communist countries. This causes me, as President of Lithuania, great concern. I do not think that the world community can afford to remain indifferent to this problem. Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 15 religious and political beliefs, A democratic and civic State, based on the rule of law, in which people are not segregated according to their nationality or is being established in Lithuania. There is no tension in our country between Lithuanians and ethnic minorities. We are reforming and stabilizing the Lithuanian economy; we are searching for ways to provide at least minimal social welfare guarantees; as much as possible we are trying to clear the way for private initiative. We cannot, however, change our economy overnight. The Lithuanian people are patient and industrious, working hard for their well-being and future. However, disillusion with democracy and the free market would be disastrous. for Therefore I wish to speak very frankly to this body: even though we feel the concern and support of the world It appears that even the community, that is not enough. most authoritative international organizations lack the coordinated action and initiative truly effective assistance. We occasionally feel isolationist tendencies on the part of the most industrialized nations; having attained a high standard of living, they attempt to dissociate themselves from the countries of Eastern and Central Europe. This greatly complicates the future of these countries as they attempt to solve by themselves the difficult economic, political, psychological, cultural and historical problems that they have inherited from the recent past. In most post-communist countries there still prevails a nostalgia for the past, when authoritarian government guaranteed people their minimum needs, albeit at the expense of their freedom. Without this nostalgia for a pseudo-socialistic past could cause the development of certain countries to follow a course that would be unacceptable to all of us. timely and joint efforts, For several years now, both in Europe and North America, the idea of a new \"Marshall Plan\" has been in the air, but it has in no way materialized. Yet investments in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe - and I have in mind not only financial investments - would really be investments in all of our futures. Greater and more effective assistance for the democratic forces in post-communist States would help decisively to rid the world of the remnants of totalitarianism and dictatorship that have so tormented mankind in the twentieth century. With the dissolution of two hostile blocs, the world has become a safer place. However, that does not solve all the security problems that mankind now faces. Indeed, the number of such problems has increased. There is now a greater possibility of localized conflicts: they have flared up in precisely those places where dictatorships that suppressed nations have fallen. Such horrendous practices as \"ethnic cleansing\" must be severely condemned. The model of an absolutely closed nation-State is no longer a viable one for the solution of separate national problems. The Lithuanian people respect the struggle of nations for their freedom, but they condemn atrocities which occur under the guise of a noble cause. The tragedy of what was formerly Yugoslavia is truly horrible. We approve of the means that the United Nations uses to uphold peace and security, but too often resolution of the structure of a State and border issues are left to warring countries to decide by force of arms. In the future the United Nations should pursue even more actively preventive diplomacy to stop conflicts before they erupt. Every illegal and violent act requires a response, not appeasement. The Secretary-Generals \"An Agenda for Peace\" is a welcome plan that provides a solid foundation. What should the new role of the United Nations be in an ever-changing world? As I see it, in future the Organization must not only be a guarantor of security, but also an instigator of economic development and a global defender of human and ethnic minority rights. At the Vienna Conference on Human Rights, we spoke out in favour of establishing the post of high commissioner for human rights. At this time, ideas about the sovereignty of States, the self-determination of nations, national and enforcement of peace are changing rapidly. The individual problems of individual States are becoming global in scope, especially in the areas of environmental protection, refugees, narcotics and organized crime. For precisely that reason, cooperation among neighbouring States is growing in importance. security and the maintenance regional Regional structures and arrangements interaction is broadening and the role of international organizations is being extended. We approve of that help to guarantee peace and stability in their respective regions. However, their activities should be linked with United Nations supervision, so that large and powerful nations do not transform such regional structures into instruments of domination. I am referring to failed States. They need international assistance that would not force upon them the protectorate of another State or provide conditions for assimilating them into some sort of sphere of influence, but would and independence. Small countries have a right to rely on a firm guarantee of security. The United Nations could and should become that guarantee. In the long-term future, as democracy and cooperation become firmly established sovereignty respect and protect their 16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session throughout our planet, the United Nations would perhaps assume certain functions of a world government. I reiterate my support for Lithuanias proposal, which was outlined here at the United Nations exactly one year ago, that new permanent members could be added to the Security Council. For the United Nations to achieve its objective, it is important to continue and even expand the system reforms that are now being put into effect to increase cost-efficiency. We welcome the initiatives by several countries, among them the United States, to establish more dependable internal and external inspection machinery. The suggested creation of an office of inspector-general could help to assure Member States that the mandates that we have provided for various programmes are put to the most effective use possible. its obligations I should like to state clearly that the current financial crisis of the United Nations is of great concern to Lithuania. We are not indifferent to it. Lithuania is firmly resolved to fulfil to the Organization and it has demonstrated its readiness to do so. Lithuania could support the activities of the Organization even more strongly if for three years now we had not been forced repeatedly to discuss the difficult problem of assessments with regard to the United Nations budget. Our delegation, along with other countries that have found themselves in a similar situation, has on more than one occasion suggested ways in which this problem could be solved. I wish to emphasize that the position of Lithuania remains unchanged. The scale of assessments must be determined on the basis of statistical data provided by each State, in accordance with its capacity to pay and, most important, abiding by the principle that the same methodology for calculating assessments must be applied to all States equally. In seeking to ensure these principles and finally to resolve this problem, we are prepared to exchange ideas with, and we hope for the cooperation of, all delegations. I reiterate my support for Lithuanias proposal, made here at the United Nations exactly a year ago, that new permanent members could be added to the Security Council. Lithuania not only supports peace-keeping efforts, but would like eventually to become a contributor to military and civilian operations. When Lithuania became a member of the Council of Europe I suggested a meeting of all the Heads of State of post-communist countries. This would not be an attempt to create some sort of new bloc or to console each other about our economic hardships. Such a conference, under the auspices of the Council of Europe or perhaps some other organization, could provide an opportunity to discuss in a down-to-earth way how to recover more quickly from the maladies of national egoism and ethnocentricity that may be unavoidable in young States and fragile democracies. All of us in post-communist countries should, as quickly as possible, learn how to cooperate among ourselves and with the rest of the world and strive to be better full-fledged members of our planets democratic community. Other countries have learned the art of cooperation over decades. We have not had that much time. It is very important that we succeed through a joint effort in making this period as brief as possible. We welcome the initiative by some Members of the United Nations to establish a forum for new and restored democracies. It is our sincere hope that this movement, begun in the Philippines, will help bring developing countries and countries in transition closer together, so that they may reach common approaches down the path to democracy and a free market. The spirit of the approaching twenty-first century already fills this Hall. At the turn of the third millennium mankind is faced with critical global problems that threaten its very existence: ecological, social and spiritual problems and the nuclear threat, which has not yet been abolished. National and regional problems seem to pale in comparison, but I do not think that that is really the case. Every step towards progress, even if taken in a small country or with regard to improved relations between two States, diminishes the possibility of global conflict, and vice versa. I should therefore like to believe that the withdrawal of the Russian military from Lithuania was an achievement for more than just two countries. The entire world became somewhat better, somewhat more just, and the threat that hung over it was abated. I think that there will be more and more such successes. The United Nations system contributes, and will continue to contribute, significantly to their attainment. "}}
