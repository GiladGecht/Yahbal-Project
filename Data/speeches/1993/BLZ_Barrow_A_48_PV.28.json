{"speech":{"0":" The delegation of Belize takes immense pride, Sir, in your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. This is the first the Organization that a Commonwealth Caribbean national has been chosen to superintend the deliberations of the General Assembly. Your election is, thus, not only the highest tribute that could have been paid you, but is also the accomplishment of your country, Guyana, the wider Commonwealth Caribbean. As a part of the latter, Belize may be forgiven for any note of self-congratulation that creeps into the encomiums we heap upon you today. and of In that regard - and we say this only slightly with tongue in cheek - we note that almost your first act of wisdom upon assuming office was the selection of a very excellent Belizean as presidential spokesperson. Let me at this time also record my delegations appreciation of the most able manner in which the outgoing President, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, conducted the work of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. 14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session In addition, may I take the opportunity to welcome formally to the United Nations family the six countries - the Czech Republic, Eritrea, Monaco, the Slovak Republic, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Andorra - which have joined the Organization this year. Allow me also to offer, on behalf of the people and the Government of Belize, our deep sympathy to the people and the Government of India for the heavy death toll and considerable material loss caused by the devastating earthquake on 30 September. through peaceful elections, Over the five years since I last appeared in this Hall, many things have changed in the world. In Belize we, too, have experienced change. On 30 June 1993 the people of Belize voted, for a new government. Once more we have demonstrated the stability of our democratic institutions and the maturity of our polity. In an age when the so-called global trend towards democratization seems at times to be a process that moves one step forward and two steps back, we in Belize are justly proud of our record. In these five years, some of the changes occurring in the global prospect have been favourable, and many of these are attributable to this Organization, which, under its distinguished Secretary-General, has been striving to fulfil the mandate of its Charter and find ways and means to cope with problems not necessarily envisaged by the framers of that Charter. In the brief tour dhorizon of the international scene which I shall undertake today, the first matter I wish to address is peace and security. We are very gratified by the positive developments that have occurred in several places. Uppermost in our minds is our own subregion of Central America. There we have been heartened by the movement of several of our neighbours towards reconciliation and social justice. In particular, we note with satisfaction that the brief hiccup of the events in the Republic of Guatemala in May and June does not appear to have seriously flawed that countrys efforts at permanent redemocratization. We are happy that the new government there has publicly confirmed Guatemalas recognition of sovereign and independent Belize. Diplomatic relations between our two countries can once again proceed apace; and we shall continue the work for the preservation of bilateral and regional security and the search for a lasting solution to the issues that still bedevil us. In accordance with the principles enunciated by this Organization, such a solution must be on the basis of mutual for peace, the rights of both countries to respect self-determination and for the integrity of each others land and sea territory. for In the Caribbean we have hopes that the long-suffering people of Haiti will be rewarded by the return of its legitimate government. Recent developments in South Africa are clearly very encouraging, and we are confident of the success of the transition to majority rule, which will be heralded by the non-racial elections scheduled for April 1994. Then, in the midst of continued strife in the Middle East, we believe we see positive signs of the way forward with the dramatic opening between the people of Palestine and the State of Israel. At long last there seems a real possibility of to self- determination coexisting with the State of Israels right to safe and secure borders. the Palestinian peoples right We welcome the finalization of the demarcation of the boundary between Kuwait and Iraq, which was accomplished by the Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission on 20 May 1993. We also welcome the adoption by the Security Council of resolution 833 (1993), in which it guaranteed the inviolability of the boundary between the two States. Encouraging, too, has been the consolidation of the broad consultative mechanisms for confidence-building, security, human rights and cooperation originally established for Europe in the Helsinki Conference and now substantially expanded. Such structures have considerable value, and we understand that our colleagues in the countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) are in the process of developing a similar mechanism with a distinct ASEAN character. Above all, we commend the Secretary-General for his vision in \"An Agenda for Peace\". Despite all these promising developments, however, the overall outlook for world security remains bleak. In far too many places the peace is disrupted by fratricidal struggle. Everywhere the crushing burden of armaments - to employ a famous expression used by President Roosevelt and Winston Churchill in 1941 - bids to drive our planet off its established course. The Second World War was partly fought, and this great Organization was largely established, to eradicate programmes of ethnic genocide. Now, nearly 50 years after the birth of the United Nations, we are experiencing several such programmes on a massive scale. Forty-eighth session - 13 October l993 15 I urge that during this session we take the first major step to right these imbalances, which affect global peace and security. Just as the Helsinki model is one way forward, we hope that another is the International Tribunal on war crimes, the judges of which this Assembly recently elected. Among other steps which might be taken are the following: Governments must forswear profiteering from the sale or sponsorship of the sale of armaments. There must be an expansion of regional and subregional systems of cooperation and coordination in the cognate areas of security, narcotics interdiction and counter-terrorism. This body must make firm recommendations for the development and rigid enforcement of domestic neutrality laws everywhere. Likewise, law relating to neutrality must be thoroughly modernized to proscribe and severely punish trafficking in arms. This must be not only in situations of belligerency, but also in cases of insurgency, rebellion and other armed conflict, both internal and international. The recent salutary reinvigoration of this Organizations peace-keeping mechanisms must be furthered. the international This is a time when the United Nations is increasingly being called upon to act as a peacemaker in troubled and turbulent regions of the world. It is to the Organizations credit it has risen to the occasion by undertaking complex and challenqinq assignments around the globe. that There was a time when United Nations peace-keeping forces could successfully be composed of contingents from the so-called third world countries. But recent experience has now shown that large and difficult operations of the Bosnia and Somalia type stand little chance of success without the active participation of major Powers. In this context, we welcome President Clintons speech in this session of the Assembly, offering to commit United States troops to the United Nations Bosnia operation under certain conditions. the Charter, which calls Yet there is still a role for small States. And we in Belize would be prepared to offer training facilities to the Organization as a contribution to increasing the efficiency of peace-keeping forces. This would be in accordance with Article 43 of for member Governments to make available to the Security Council \"assistance and facilities ... necessary for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security\". Needless to say, we would be happy to make our contribution in concert with other countries in our area. Either pre-existing regional security mechanisms anor new bilateral and multilateral arrangements might serve as the vehicle for small country efforts at cooperation. As a backdrop to all this, the provisions of the Charter relative to peacemaking must be strengthened. In particular, a standing United Nations force under unified United Nations command should be considered and the Military Staff Committee must be made fully operational. In keeping with the Secretary-Generals quest to improve efficiencies, strict military discipline of United Nations forces must be established and there must be improved coordination at Headquarters and in the field. The most important of the steps which my Government believes should be taken is reform of the Security Council. It is self-evident that in these times of turmoil and increased United Nations activity the agenda item of equitable representation on, and increase in membership of, the Council looms large. Belize has recently submitted a paper to the Secretary-General, detailing our ideas on this all-important topic. I wish to turn next to international cooperation. I believe that there exists an international legal obligation to cooperate in good faith. It is anticipated in the Articles on principles and purposes and other provisions of the United Nations Charter, and is reiterated in such Declarations as the friendly relations Declaration of 1970 and the 1974 Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. I will address the question of economic cooperation at a later stage in my remarks. At this point, I wish to train the spotlight on cooperation in the area of ecospheric concerns. ratification of As regards the ecosphere, Belize considers that the the United Nations early and universal Convention on the Law of the Sea is of paramount importance. It will be recalled that the Convention imposes myriad duties of cooperation. In that way, the weak, and not only the strong and mighty, will inherit the Earth and its waters. In that intensive We have seen two recent examples of successful efforts at cooperation in the ecosphere. The first involves the ozone cooperation by layer. Governments and by private industry, pursuant to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, as amended, has led to a significant decline in the rate of expansion of the hole in the ozone layer. connection, My other example is the cooperation of foreign and domestic agencies with the Governments of my country, Belize and Costa Rica, which has contributed to substantial 16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session success in our conservation efforts. Cognizant of these successes, we appeal for intensive cooperation in all aspects of the ecosphere, including the termination of ocean and terrestrial dumping, the halt of desertification and the reduction of the causes of global warming. We also hope for a concrete programme of action at next Aprils Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States to be held in Barbados. One area in which we must redouble our efforts at cooperation is the moral environment. In numerous Member countries the people have clamoured for cessation of corrupt practices in government and business, both national and international. Now, we are extremely happy to observe that the Secretary-General has established the new post of Assistant and Investigations. In so doing, he has made it clear that the moral environment of our organization must be sanitized. We must support him in this endeavour. At the same time, we lend our voice to those who call for the accountability of all inter-governmental organizations to independent auditors and inspectors. Secretary-General Inspections for My Government attaches the greatest importance to integrity and decency in public life. We applaud such international efforts as the forthcoming anti-corruption conference to be held in Mexico later this year to plan national strategies for fighting corruption. And we in Belize have recently taken our own action to strengthen the legal infrastructure necessary to banish the scourge of political corruption. In just three months since taking office, we have introduced four major pieces of legislation in our Parliament. They are the Prevention of Corruption in Public Life Bill, the Ombudsman Bill, the Contractor General Bill and the Freedom of Information Bill. This last, as far as we can determine, its kind in the entire Commonwealth Carribean. These measures bear testimony to my Governments determination to wage a total war on corruption and to make Belize the model of a just, honest and democratic society. is the only one of I to issues turn next relating to international development and economic relations. For over 30 years, the Organization has painstakingly sought to spell out that the right to development and the duty of the privileged to assist the underprivileged are firmly based in international law and public policies. This right and duty were part of the \"freedom from want\" principle, one of the founding principles of the 1942 wartime coalition that was the first to be called the \"United Nations\". Freedom from want had nothing to do with ideology and great-Power rivalry. ideological, Nevertheless, there have been dramatic geopolitical and economic changes during the late 1980s. As these changes have occurred, needs have increased but resources have not. Yet we have heard rumours that various initiatives to bring economic justice to this planet are no longer necessary. I respectfully suggest that nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, such controversial movements as the one to establish a new international economic order were merely, as we have intimated, the reiteration of an established principle. That is, those initiatives were the renewal of an order, not a new order. Furthermore, in the original Somalia intervention, we see strong confirmation of the continuing vitality of the principle of \"freedom from want\" - for all of us will remember that the avowed objective of the current exercises in that beleaguered country was to bring food, comfort and succour to its suffering people. Thus, I believe, we are seeing the reaffirmation of freedom from want as a human right. At the same time, I would urge the Assembly to take firm steps to ensure that food no longer be used as a weapon by parties to civil and international conflicts. In all this we are acutely aware of the shift in world trading patterns brought on by the formation of new trading blocs. The most recent and prominent of these are of course the North American Free Trade Agreement among Mexico, the United States of America and Canada, and the Single European Market. And so, in some areas at least, the march towards wider trade liberalization and true market economy moves inexorably forward. But we in the South also see that our economies and life as we know them are threatened by these developments; our preferential access to markets steadily erodes and our terms of trade consistently worsen. What we are in fact concerned about here is the pressure to open up our borders prematurely to the free flow of agricultural and other products from the more developed countries. It is a bitter pill to swallow, even as we watch the protectionist squabbling among developed countries that has prevented the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Of course, it would also result in massive economic dislocation followed inevitably by social and political unrest in our countries. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that we must in the long run identify alternative commodities that we can produce efficiently and with comparative advantage. I must stress, however, that we are hard pressed to find the resources required for comprehensive research, development and Forty-eighth session - 13 October l993 17 promotion programmes for new products. We must be afforded an adequate transition period to adjust our economic and production activities. I would wish, therefore, to take this opportunity to call on the countries members of the Organization and Development to identify and dedicate significant financial and technical in developing alternative products. Of course, current trends in official and private financial flows to the developing world suggest that this is a cry that will fall largely on deaf ears. Economic Cooperation small countries to assist resources for On a more positive note, permit me at this juncture to applaud the apparent resolve of the United Nations organs for development assistance to improve their efforts at coordination. In this connection, I single out for special mention the Secretary- Generals ongoing formulation of an agenda for development and the determined spirit of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to strengthen its mission and revamp its machinery. This, however, is but a beginning of what must be a crusade for development. The last set of issues I shall address are social, political, cultural and humanitarian. First, we must do much more to ensure that women are accorded their proper rights in the domestic and international orders. No longer should we merely echo the litany that womens development is indispensable for economic development. We must ensure rights in all spheres. that women are accorded equal Furthermore, equal representation in our political, social, cultural and other institutions. Again, I take note of the recent efforts of this Organization to improve the position of women in the upper echelons of the United Nations Secretariat. they must urgently given be As regards refugees, it would be disingenuous to call for their enhanced protection without acknowledging the severe problems which host countries increasingly face. For instance, we in Belize do the best we can, but overcrowding a slender raft - even in a relative haven of calm - can bring dire consequences to all its occupants. Nevertheless, I am happy to report to this Assembly that Belizes record of human rights is good and worthy of emulation. Our Constitution is founded on the principles of justice and respect for the fundamental freedoms of all our people, and our laws and practices fully conform to the mandate of our Constitution. The international scourge of narcotics continues unabated. Again, we add our voices to those who urge that at least the same degree of attention be given to curbing demand and improving public health, as to addressing supply. Narcotics, terrorism and urban violence are all gross manifestations of an awful cancer seeking to engulf our planet. One clear contributor to this is the mass and universal culture, or what passes for culture, purveyed by the moguls of television. While we welcome the utility of the new global news channels, we lament the other, baneful, influences to which our people are subjected by some aspects of worldwide programming. It is high time that this Organization tackle this problem. Finally, as regards human riqhts and humanitarian law, even over the brief period of five years since I last addressed this body, we have witnessed significant expansion in the activities of the Commission on Human Rights and the bodies established under the various United Nations instruments for the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. We have seen this Organization, on invitation, participate in monitoring and conducting elections and, in the unprecedented case of Cambodia, actually administer a country prior to the holding of democratic elections. Yet the basic rights of human beings in numerous places are still seriously impaired. Many of those who should protect, in fact violate. And conferences, tribunals and conventions bring scarce relief. In the realm of humanitarian law, we are hopeful that the International Tribunal on war crimes will set a healthy precedent. Nevertheless, we view with increasing concern the flouting of the Geneva regime, especially the 1977 Protocols applicable to various forms of civil strife. That regime is the other side of the coin of human rights. Whichever side comes up when that coin is tossed, it comes up tarnished. Clearly, despite a somewhat mixed record, the United Nations is no moribund organization. Nevertheless, as it nears its golden jubilee, it does require additional impetus, a more focused consensus for reform and revitalization. Let all of us, then, as we go about the business of this forty- eighth session, bear well in mind the words of the Preamble to the Charter and accordingly pledge our rededication to the task of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war, reaffirming faith in fundamental human rights and equality, and creating the moral climate in which justice and international law will finally prevail. Mr. ALLAGANY (Saudi Arabia) (interpretation from Arabic): It is with pleasure that I convey to Your Excellency at the outset of my statement, our sincerest congratulations on your election to the Presidency of the forty-eighth session of the 18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session General Assembly of the United Nations. Your election reflects appreciation for you personally, as well as for the positive role played by your country in the international arena. I wish you every success in the pursuit of your mission. On this occasion, I also wish to congratulate your predecessor for his effective guidance of the affairs of the General Assembly at its previous session. I also wish to acknowledge the sincere efforts constantly exerted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to enhance the prospects for peace and reduce the elements of tension which prevail in many parts of the world. I am also pleased to welcome, on behalf of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, all the States that have joined our Organization to participate, along with all other Member States, in realizing the noble objectives towards which we all strive. This session of the General Assembly takes place amidst important developments in the international arena that require us to strive to conclude our work with successful resolutions on the problems and crises we face. These resolutions must be within the context of our efforts to benefit from the opportunities provided by the emergence of what has come to be known as the new international order. We have all contributed, through the United Nations to establishing the new international order, the foundations of which are based on the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and inherent in international law. This new order respects the sovereignty and independence of States and guarantees the inviolability of their international borders. It guarantees the territorial integrity of States and rejects interference in their domestic affairs. It is based on equity among nations, small and large, rich and poor, and its goal is to replace war and destruction with cooperation between nations and peoples. The new international order strives for the peaceful resolution of conflict and rejects the use of force or coercion. It operates to preserve the dignity of man and to spread security, stability, prosperity and development to all corners of our world. The emergence of this new order has been a source of hope and optimism for the international community, particularly when serious and constructive international cooperation succeeded in confronting the Iraqi aggression against the State of Kuwait. Today, however, we are saddened and pained by the inability of this order to confront a State Member of our the aggression committed against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, international Organization. This crisis, if not resolved in a manner compatible with the principles of the new world order, will cause this new order to lose its credibility and effectiveness. We therefore call for enhancing the role of the United Nations and maintenance of peace to one of active and effective peacemaking. from one of mere crisis management A general overview of the current international situation reveals that there remain pockets of tension which threaten security and stability in many regions of the world. With the persistence of such challenges, the role of the United Nations is becoming increasingly important, not only for the maintenance of peace, but as an effective means for creating conditions conducive to peace and stability throughout the world. Without a doubt, the creation of such conditions will be made much easier if the opportunities for cooperation between nations are increased and support for the United Nations is strengthened so that the Organization may function in a manner that would guarantee that no country commits aggression against another or threatens its security, sovereignty or territorial integrity. The honourable role played by the United Nations more than three years ago when it stood firmly in the face of Iraqs aggression against its neighbour Kuwait, and the resolutions it adopted led in the end to repelling aggression and restoring legality to Kuwait the peace-loving nation. This positive role portrays our expectations of this international body in the present circumstances. We hope that it will continue to be played and ask that it be enhanced by efforts to ensure the complete implementation of all Security Council resolutions regarding the Iraqi regime, which continues to flout international legality. Two years after the liberation of Kuwait, the Baghdad regime continues to resort to threats and false allegations against Kuwait. It continues to delay efforts to implement United Nations resolutions and rejects all international obligations. We point in particular to the Iraqi regimes objections to the recommendations of Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission and its rejection of Security Council resolution 833 (1993), as well as its continued detention of Kuwaiti hostages and prisoners of war. This regime has arrogated the right, on the basis of sovereignty, to starve and abuse its people and subject Iraq to dangers which threaten its unity and security. It falsely blames the international community for the dangers and tragedies to which Iraq and its people have become subject. The surest way of facing up to the threats this regime poses the United Nations Forty-eighth session - 13 October l993 19 to the region as a whole, and to the Iraqi people is to fully and completely implement Security Council resolutions. The Declaration of Principles between the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Israeli Government, signed in Washington, D.C. on 13 September 1993, has raised expectations and hopes that a just and permanent settlement can be found to the Arab-Israeli conflict, which has persisted for far too long. This development, though representing only an agreement on autonomy in the occupied Palestinian territories, beginning with Gaza and Jericho, nevertheless represents a step towards the establishment of a just, comprehensive and permanent peace between the Arab States and Israel. A solution to the Palestinian question will obviously contribute to a just and comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict as it is the core issue of that conflict. the Arabs The warm welcome with which the Palestinian-Israeli agreement was received within Palestinian, Arab and international circles genuinely and clearly reflects the desire of and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. It also indicates the seriousness with which the Arab side has pursued the current peace process, which was launched in Madrid in October 1991 under the sponsorship of the United States of America and the Russian Federation. to establish a permanent, just As we witness today the optimism generated by the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, we cannot but feel that it is incumbent upon the international community to lend support to the progress that has been achieved in this area by providing the necessary economic and developmental assistance required to build the administrative structures needed to make the agreement on self-rule succeed. At the same time, it is also incumbent upon us to work diligently to exploit the momentum generated by this agreement in furthering the cause of peace. The consolidation of this step requires the achievement of tangible and positive results in the areas of negotiation between Palestinians and Israelis; at the forefront of those are the issue of Al-Quds, which is an integral part of the occupied Arab territories, the return of Palestinian refugees, and the settlements built by Israel in the occupied Arab territories contrary to international law and the Geneva Conventions. At the same time, genuine progress along all the other bilateral negotiating tracks is needed. the issue of The issue of the occupied Arab Syrian Golan Heights it is governed by the principle of respect for is clear: international borders. The maintenance of security is not feasible, as the realities of contemporary history teach us, through the occupation of territory by force, but rather through the establishment of peace. Thus, peace on this front will be achieved only by a complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights. Likewise, the Lebanese-Israeli negotiating track is governed by United Nations Security Council resolution 425 (1978), which clearly calls immediate, unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Lebanese territory. the for I wish to express the appreciation of the Government of the Custodian of the two holy mosques to President Clinton for his prudent initiative in calling for, and hosting, an international donors conference to solicit political and financial support for the Palestinians as they prepare to assume the responsibilities of self-rule in the occupied I also wish to take this opportunity to express territories. our pleasure at that conference. the positive results achieved at The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has given, and continues to give, its full support in all possible forms to the Middle East peace process since it began in Madrid. It has participated effectively in the multilateral talks, and genuinely hopes that lead to a just, permanent and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian question and the Arab conflict with Israel on the basis of United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). the process will Despite the financial burdens the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia bears in building an advanced economy in which the expectations of its citizens for a better future are fulfilled, and despite its current international obligations at a time of difficulty in the international economic system, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia participated in the international donors conference in Washington. recently concluded its meetings that to providing substantial The Custodian of the two holy mosques has bestowed upon me the honour of announcing the Kingdoms commitment developmental assistance to improve the infrastructures in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in coordination and cooperation with the World Banks special five-year programme for the occupied territories. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will participate, through the Saudi development to the tune of $100 million for the year 1994. We believe that this improve the living conditions of our assistance will fund, 20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session Palestinian brethren in the occupied Arab territories and contribute positively to the peace process. their aggression, and to continue their abhorrent policy of \"ethnic cleansing\" without fear of retribution. The Lebanese Government has made great strides in its efforts to implement the Taif Accords, and has taken the necessary political and constitutional measures to achieve this aim. We must continue our support for the efforts of the legitimate Lebanese authorities and contribute to the process of reconstruction in Lebanon. In this regard, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia appeals to the international community to help Lebanon by all available means in order to enable its Government to continue moving forward with the process of reconstruction and allow Lebanon to regain its material and cultural position. It is important to reiterate the need, if this goal is to be achieved, for an Israeli commitment to implement, fully and unconditionally, United Nations Security Council resolution 425 (1978), which requires Israel to withdraw from Lebanese territory to enable the Lebanese Government to extend its legal authority over all Lebanon. We should like to emphasize our desire for the Middle East region to obtain its legitimate share of security, peace and stability so that it is able to direct all its energies towards development and devote all its resources towards prosperity for its people. is a important One of the most tasks facing us in this respect is to strive towards the elimination of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia signatory to the Convention on the non-proliferation of chemical weapons and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We continue to believe that the goal of making the Middle East a region free of all kinds of weapons of mass destruction, whether nuclear, chemical or biological, will be realized only when all States in the region, including Israel, refrain from the production, stockpiling, or possession of any kind of weapon of mass destruction. The situation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is being aggravated by the continuation of a genocidal war waged by Serb forces, with the support of Serbia and Montenegro, against that young Republic. The continuing tragedy of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has resulted in the death of thousands of innocent civilians and the displacement of a large portion of its citizens, would not have occurred were it not for the apparent indifference of the international community. This attitude allowed the forces of aggression to benefit from This feeble stand on the part the international community, particularly the European countries, was reflected in the inability to implement comprehensively the resolutions of the London Conference, upon which we had rested great hopes. It is also reflected in the failure of the Vance-Owen plan and the collapse of the subsequent Geneva talks on refugees. The international communitys dereliction of its responsibilities vis-a-vis the Serb aggression has emboldened the Croats to embark upon a similar course of making gains by means of force and coercion. resolutions calling for Against such a backdrop, it was strange indeed that when Croatia was targeted by Serbian aggression, the international community, and especially the European nations, were quick to stand by Croatia and provide military assistance that contributed to the success of international efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement, whereas the international communitys feeble stance in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its failure to implement the international the imposition of economic sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro, have deprived that young Republic of the means of exercising its legitimate right to self-defence. Those resolutions and the sanctions they call for remained dead letter and were not seriously implemented until it was too late, after the Serbs had rejected the Vance-Owen Plan, which the Bosnians and Croats had accepted. What really shocks and amazes us is that this war of aggression is being waged on the European soil whereas history teaches us that such wars on that soil have never been limited wars but have always overspilled beyond the borders. However, no one seems to be paying any attention to those object-lessons. While we hope that the history of Europes wars will not repeat itself, we hope that the solutions that are being proposed do not turn out to be the seeds of future conflicts and disputes. We hope that the international community will give serious consideration to the demands of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina so that it may be saved from any repetition of the policies of aggression and \"ethnic cleansing\". The geographical demands of that young nation should be satisfied by granting it access to the sea as well as providing it with the means of legitimate self-defence, in consonance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. Forty-eighth session - 13 October l993 21 The principled stand by the people and Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in support of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina emanates from their strong and total adherence for international law and not from any religious fanaticism or ethnic affinity. It is the same principled stand that was taken by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in support of Kuwait when it fell victim to the Iraqi regimes aggression. legality and respect to international Somalia continues to be in the grip of instability and political chaos, with all the attendant acts of violence and bloodshed, despite all the efforts deployed to help that nation out of its plight. International efforts, during the Conference for National Reconciliation held at Addis Ababa, focused on the preservation of the Somali State and the maintenance of its independence and territorial integrity. Unfortunately, the required steps have not been taken for the serious implementation of that Agreement. The role of the United Nations has been limited to the distribution of humanitarian assistance to those in need at a time when the role it is expected to play within the new world order is to contribute to peacemaking and to the stabilization of the Somali State. should help to establish a Somali Such measures Government that can extend its authority throughout Somalia. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made a number of attempts to contain the conflict in Somalia and has tried to bring about national reconciliation among the various It will continue to deploy efforts to stop the factions. bloodshed and to provide humanitarian assistance and relief. We support the Secretary-Generals recommendations in his report to the Security Council, on the means of helping re- establish Somalias constitutional institutions and on the efforts needed to reach national reconciliation and to rebuild Somalia. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stood by the fraternal people of Afghanistan throughout their jihad and celebrated with them their victory over the forces of brutal occupation in the struggle for restoring their national identity. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia spared no effort in working for reconciliation when the infighting started between the various mujahidin factions. Those efforts were crowned with the signing of the Mecca Agreement and the initiation of A National Government that combined all factions of the Afghan mujahidin was established. We take this opportunity to urge our brethren in Afghanistan to comply with the terms of the agreement so that Afghanistan may begin to move towards reconstruction and development and regain its place and role in the international community. implementation. towards steps its It must be noted that that part of the world continues to suffer as a result of the problem of Jammu and Kashmir, which continues to be an element of instability in the region. The Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques follows with great concern the ongoing violence there. We are keen on finding a solution on the basis of United Nations resolutions has overshadowed the relations of the two neighbours, India and Pakistan. problem that long-standing this to Among the other conflicts in Asia I would refer to the tragic developments resulting from the worsening conflict between two United Nations Member States, the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia. That conflict has recently resulted in the occupation by Armenia of parts of Azerbaijan. We consider that occupation to be a breach of the principle of the peaceful resolution of conflicts, and emphasize the importance of withdrawal by Armenias forces from Azerbaijans territory in order to transfer that issue to the negotiating table with the aim of reaching a peaceful and just settlement that would ensure the legitimate rights of the people of Azerbaijan. Our joint and serious efforts towards consolidating the underpinnings of the new world order aim at making it possible to address the issues of development and the creation of an international economic environment in which financial resources would be diverted from arms races to economic and social development. Those efforts are in keeping with our ambitions and the aspirations of our peoples for a better world of peace, prosperity and security. Such an enterprise requires the cooperation of the developed industrial nations by opening their markets to the products of the developing nations, the elimination of protectionist measures, ensuring an early successful outcome to the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks and finding an urgent, rapid solution to the debt problem. On the other hand, cooperation between the developing countries themselves is a paramount issue and represents a fundamental tool for consolidating international economic growth. economic My Government attaches great importance to issues relating to the world economic system. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia represents a State open to the world, interacting with all the trends and developments that affect it. Thus, we are keen on preserving the health and strength of the world economy, and we are concerned by the disruptions and development. It is on that basis that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is participating positively in the ongoing discussions on energy and environment. We have shouldered our and turmoil course affect that its 22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session confidence, and it is a society undergoing evolution and significant reform.
