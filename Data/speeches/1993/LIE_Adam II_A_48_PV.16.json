{"speech":{"0":" Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly and to express our conviction that your experience and diplomatic skills will make a valuable contribution to the work of this august body. My delegation will spare no effort to support you in the fulfilment of your tasks. I should also like to avail myself of this opportunity to thank your predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for the way he conducted the work of the General Assembly during a difficult period. Over the last eight months, this Organization has been able to welcome six new Member States: Slovakia, the Czech Republic, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Monaco, Eritrea and Andorra, thus enhancing the universality of the United Nations. Since the last session of the General Assembly we have been witness to historic gains in regional disputes. The signing of the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization is a unique breakthrough and will, it is hoped, lead to a just and lasting peace for the region. When the President of the African National Congress, Mr. Nelson Mandela, spoke in this Hall on 24 September, he outlined the historic advances made towards democracy in South Africa. We are very hopeful that a new South Africa will play a vital role in the development of the African continent. My country was admitted to the United Nations on 18 September 1990 and has tried over the last three years to maintain as active a presence and participation as possible. While Liechtenstein was the 160th Member in 1990, the Organization today has 184 members. This considerable increase in the Organizations membership makes it clear that the ongoing discussion of equitable representation on and expansion of the Security Councils membership is timely and necessary. It In our view, the priorities in reforming the Security Council are cohesion and effectiveness. is of great importance, however, that the discussion of reforms also include the question of the Security Councils work, since broad support for its actions is an indispensable condition of its legitimacy, which can only be guaranteed by enhanced transparency and cooperation with other Member States. Article 23 of the Charter establishes that the contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security is the first criterion for membership in the Council; it is obvious that the second criterion - equitable geographical distribution - has so far not been given due attention. In view of the obvious importance of the Security Councils composition, we favour taking the necessary time to make adjustments beneficial to the credibility of the Organization as a whole. The new effectiveness of the Security Council is manifested, among other ways, by the recent considerable increase of peace-keeping and peacemaking missions. These operations are closely observed by the public and are often taken as a yardstick for the activities of the United Nations as a whole. While we think it important to give more attention to other fields, such as that of social development, we are aware of the impact that the failure or success of peace-keeping activities can have on the credibility of the Organization. In our view, the United Nations should not engage in an ever-increasing number of peace-keeping Forty-eighth session - 5 October l993 9 missions all over the world. A more important role should be given to preventive diplomacy, which can be carried out by regional organizations or arrangements such as the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). The participating States consider the CSCE a regional arrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter, and as such it provides an important link between European and global security. Liechtenstein, as a participating State, believes the cooperation with the CSCE is crucial; my country favours the idea of granting observer status to that organization and has supported the request for the inclusion of an additional item to this effect in the agenda of the forty-eighth session. that enhancement of Preventive diplomacy cannot, however, replace peace- keeping, and the United Nations must remain as active in that field as is necessary. It must be pointed out that the existing infrastructure in New York is not sufficient to cope with the wide range of tasks, and urgently needs to be improved. Deplorable events in the recent past have made it clear that there is not sufficient protection of civil and military personnel involved in peace-keeping missions. We therefore wholeheartedly welcome the inclusion of a new agenda item proposed by the delegation of New Zealand regarding the question of responsibility for attacks on United Nations and associated personnel and measures to ensure that those responsible for such attacks are brought to justice. the Organizations With the growing involvement of the United Nations in complex conflicts, role has been transformed into a more active and comprehensive one. As a result, relief workers expose their lives to great risk in their efforts to alleviate human suffering. My delegation believes that it simply cannot be tolerated that relief workers, who themselves want to save lives, should become targets. The United Nations should make it very clear that these acts of violence will not go unpunished. The emblems of the United Nations, the Red Cross and the Red Crescent must be respected. Humanitarian assistance today faces the challenge of many complex emergency situations. These challenges must be met on the basis of the principles of neutrality, impartiality and humanity; humanitarian aid must not be politicized. When we are called upon to give proof of our solidarity, we must provide the necessary financial means. We are, however, also called upon to address the root causes of many disasters, such as poverty, population increase and civil and ethnic strife. Imbalances feed misery; they not only are unfair but are dangerous. Forty-five years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a great deal remains to be done in this field, to which we attach particular importance. The World Conference on Human Rights in June 1993 was a very important event, and we all know how difficult it was to adopt the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. This text can constitute a milestone in the history of the United Nations only if it is followed by determined action by the General Assembly in the spirit of the Vienna Declaration. In our view, it is of the utmost importance that the the Centre for Human Rights be given the resources necessary to enable it to carry out its tasks even more efficiently. In addition, the creation of the post of high commissioner for human rights is a laudable initiative, and the General Assembly should provide him or her with a strong mandate within the already existing structures. It is a well-known fact that the financial situation of the United Nations is disastrous. In his speech of 26 August, the Secretary-General accordingly outlined initial steps to cope with this crisis. The measures taken by the Secretary- General seem to be unavoidable, and we hope they will not have a negative impact on the work of the General Assembly. In our view, urgent action by the General Assembly is needed to prevent further deterioration, which could have serious consequences. Punctual and full payment of the assessed contributions must be made by all States and arrears must be paid in full and promptly. Proposals aimed at ensuring proper utilization of resources and establishing adequate accountability within the United Nations should be discussed thoroughly and expeditiously. Finally, an overall reform of the financial sector seems to be necessary. All suggestions which might contribute to this aim, especially those contained in the so-called Volcker-Ogata report, should be studied with due attention. Much has been said about the changes that have taken place since the ending of the cold war. Unfortunately we cannot say that all these changes have been positive. To the infinite regret and dismay of the whole international community, we have continued to witness the outbreak of a great number of ethnic and national conflicts, accompanied by the untold suffering of innocent people. There must be a better way for the world to manage its affairs. While tensions within and between communities may be an inevitable part of the human condition, it is, in our view, of the utmost importance that ways be found to defuse them peacefully and without bloodshed. In this context, I should like to refer briefly again to an idea which might take us a step in the right direction and which I introduced when I had the great honour to address 10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session the General Assembly for the first time at its forty-sixth session, very soon after Liechtenstein became a Member of the United Nations. On that occasion, I ventured to suggest that a basis for some solutions could be found within the principle of self-determination. The value of this great principle has been fully demonstrated in the traditional context of decolonization. But it need not be limited to that context. Applied also to communities within States, and allowing for them to have different levels of autonomy according to the particular circumstances of different communities, it could perhaps defuse many of the tensions which are such a potent source of conflict. Such principles, placed within a suitable framework, would give an effective and practical dimension to the principle of self-determination which it has sometimes seemed to lack. Eventually such provisions could perhaps come to be elaborated in a convention to be of general application. Since first putting those thoughts before this Assembly, we in Liechtenstein have been encouraged by the degree of interest which has been shown in them. Our ideas are flexible, although our objective - which is to find practical and effective ways of avoiding, or at least reducing, tensions between communities - remains firm. We have refined our initial thoughts on the subject in the light of comments made by others, and we developed our ideas further at the last session of the General Assembly, both during debates in the Third Committee and when the Head of Government addressed the Assembly in the course of the general debate. represented in the Assembly, On that occasion, the Head of Government announced that the Government of Liechtenstein would be inviting each Government including Observers, to nominate an independent expert to attend an informal meeting of experts in Liechtenstein to discuss these matters further. That meeting took place from 16 to 18 March this year, attended by participants nominated by 46 States and international and non-governmental organizations. I attended it myself throughout, and can say personally how valuable we found the contributions participants made to the development of our thinking. Perhaps I might be allowed to take this opportunity to thank them all for their participation in what we see as an important and valuable project. Over the past two years we have, in these various ways, carried forward our belief that, in the ideas first put forward to Assembly in 1991, the international community may find some way forward in its search for ways of avoiding the kind of internal conflicts which cause ever-increasing human suffering and which are increasingly dangerous for the peace and safety of our world. To make further progress we decided this year to seek to inscribe an item on the Assemblys agenda which would enable our ideas to be fully discussed by the full membership of the United Nations. We are grateful that our proposal was accepted and now appears on the agenda for this session as item 108 (b), entitled \"Right of peoples to self-determination: Effective realization of the right of self-determination through autonomy\". We look forward to the debate which will follow, and I hope to be able to participate myself in at least part of it. We hope that in the light of what may be said in the debate, the Assembly will agree that there is, in the ideas which we have put forward, something valuable which merits further consideration and elaboration. We do not underestimate the difficulties ahead. We are aware of the sensitivities of this whole subject, especially in these times. Great though those difficulties and sensitivities may be for some States, we are convinced that the needs of the international community are even more pressing. The dangers, horrors and suffering to which tensions between communities within States can give rise, and of which we sadly have daily reminders, make it essential the international community to make every effort to open up new thinking in this field in order to find practical and effective means for further promoting the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. for We consider it a great privilege to have an Organization such as the United Nations, founded upon a Charter which encompasses the highest ideals of humankind. I wish to take this opportunity to reaffirm my countrys commitment to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The PRESIDENT: the General I wish to thank the Head of State of the Assembly, Principality of Liechtenstein for the statement he has just made. On behalf of His Serene Highness Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein, Head of State of the Principality of Liechtenstein, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall. AGENDA ITEM 9 (continued) GENERAL DEBATE Mr. DEMBRI (Algeria) (interpretation from Arabic): Your unanimous election, Sir, to the presidency of the forty- eighth session of the General Assembly represents a just recognition of your great diplomatic experience, your human qualities and your constant commitment to the promotion of Forty-eighth session - 5 October l993 11 dialogue and multilateral cooperation in the service of peace, security and development. I should like to congratulate you most warmly on the well-deserved tribute from the international community both to you personally and to your country. I am particularly pleased that the prestigious responsibility of guiding the work of the General Assembly has been given this year to an eminent son of Guyana, a country which, side-by-side with Algeria, has always been resolutely in the forefront of the defence of the cause of peace, justice, progress and understanding among nations. Your predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, firmly and tactfully conducted a busy and productive forty-seventh session. We wish to express our deep gratitude to him for a mission and dedication. accomplished with open-mindedness I also wish to pay special tribute to the Secretary- General of our Organization, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has spared no effort in making the United Nations rise to the many and complex challenges of a crucial period in the development of international relations. His foresight, courage and initiative have won him the esteem of all. His persevering activity bears for the United Nations the promise of the renewal after which our peoples fervently aspire. Algeria extends a warm welcome to the new Member States which have joined our Organization, and is gratified that their accession to the membership of the United Nations will contribute to the achievement of its objectives in the areas of peace and development. In recent years, the history of the world has accelerated its pace considerably. Rapid and profound changes have put paid to an international order that had long been frozen in place by the cold war. However, far from moving steadily toward the achievement of a well-ordered international society, those changes have generated the makings of a disquieting explosion. While the world changes under our very eyes, we are unable to grasp and take cognizance of the laws that govern such change. This dynamic, and the major upheavals it causes, have shaped a new geopolitical configuration in many parts of the world that has affected the lives of many of its peoples. Given this type of change, wherein inter-State relations are jostled by a proliferation of protagonists, of ambitions and gambles, and of the methods of international action there is a need for a collective effort to revitalize both our means of knowing and our methods of action. In short, we need to rethink the world order. We must, as a community of nations, succeed in controlling the changes which are taking place and the unwieldy trends that are now emerging. In this maelstrom of historical change, this period of transition with all its hesitations and emerging global dangers, the thing that attracts ones attention more than any other is the hope, the promise of a new world order that must be fashioned side by side with the daily suffering that goes on in the world and which we cannot ignore. the world order that Indeed, in spite of the glowing promises of peace and international cooperation, is taking shape now not only contains too many old hotbeds of tension, but also gives rise to new mushrooming conflicts. Tensions between ethnic and religious groups are increasing and are being exacerbated while whole regions, and even entire continents, are being marginalized in a most atrocious manner. The right of peoples to self-determination is being violated and obstructed here and there. Hunger and poverty are expanding. Imbalances in the world economy are deepening and worsening. All of these situations pose challenges to the international community that call for urgent and concerted action. It is therefore up to us - and this is the challenge faced by all nations that are bound by an ever-growing interdependence - to see to it that the ideals of justice and peace prevail, that new possibilities for the settlement of certain regional conflicts and for general and complete disarmament lead to comprehensive action eliminating the root causes of conflicts while, at the same time, promoting economic and social development, a prerequisite for international peace and security. This is why it is appropriate to underscore here the fact that the Agenda for Peace (), whose importance is recognized everywhere, will achieve its objectives only if it is accompanied by an agenda for development; for peace and development are closely interrelated, and conflicts too often take root in the soil of injustice and poverty. It is obvious that the future of the system of collective security which we wish to build will depend to a great extent on our ability to forge a consensus on the different aspects contained in the Agenda for Peace. This means that it is necessary for us to continue, collectively and without bias, to consider those aspects of the Secretary-Generals report about which differences persist or which require further elaboration and consideration. The encouraging progress achieved in strengthening the capability of the United Nations in the areas of active preventive diplomacy, as well as in peace-keeping and peacemaking operations, should be welcomed, but a great deal remains to be done in this field if we are to make better 12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session use of all the experience gained in those areas by the United Nations. We should see to it that our action remains strictly faithful to the goals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Algeria, which is honoured to participate actively and concretely in peace-keeping operations, will continue to do its share in this collective endeavour in the service of peace. The restructuring, revitalization and rationalization of the structures of the organs of the United Nations and their working methods have made considerable progress. However, this process, which is not an end in itself, will produce its full effects only if the Member States, and particularly the developed countries, reaffirm and strengthen their commitment to the United Nations and renew their political and financial support for its activities, particularly in the economic and social spheres. it In our view, It is this exacting and responsible approach that my country consistently promotes in all the areas of cooperation in which it takes part. In so doing, Algeria conducts its own action within the context of the efforts by the Non-Aligned Movement toward greater democratization of the United Nations and better balance between the spheres of competence of its organs. is time we reflected collectively on how to reform the Security Council, with a view to broadening its composition, improving its working methods and making it more accountable for its action to the entire international community in whose name it adopts its resolutions. A more representative, more transparent Security Council that would be more cognizant of the views and concerns of all; a General Assembly that would fully play its role in activating, guiding and supervising; and a United Nations system that would be more coherent and better coordinated in carrying out its development tasks: these are the three pivotal approaches that may give to the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization significant political scope and operational content and generate the makings of a new beginning. The credibility of the United Nations and the effectiveness of its action depend on this, as do international peace, security and cooperation. All the initiatives by my country at the national and regional levels are inspired by the ideals of peace, justice and cooperation. The national-renewal plan upon which Algeria has embarked in the interests of political stability, the consolidation of the democratic process, the revitalization of economic growth and the upholding of the rule of law is a plan that translates into action our resolve to guarantee, for all Algerians, the rights to security and well-being in a just, modern and democratic society. Given this determination, our efforts in combating terrorism and our efforts aimed at providing the conditions for real growth stem from the same overriding priority, that of meeting the expectations of our people be fulfilled by restoring the authority of the State and creating the conditions for an orderly transition that would make possible stable and coherent progress towards a market economy through viable and orderly reforms. Such a vast enterprise must find its expression and derive its support from an active foreign policy based on the principles and ideals of non-alignment and geared towards the promotion of peace, stability and cooperation at the regional and international levels. In this spirit, Algeria works steadily and resolutely for success in the process of building a united Maghreb. The important achievements that have been made so far, which will help us to benefit from the complementary nature of the countries of the union of the Arab Maghreb, confirm that the dynamics of this unifying process have enabled us to mobilize our energies, despite certain persistent problems that affect regional stability. Our countrys central position in the region, its resolve to reinforce and promote the building of the Maghreb and its commitment to international legality have prompted it to encourage the kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front to turn to direct, sincere, constructive dialogue that can facilitate the implementation of the peace plan prepared jointly by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity, with the full agreement of the two parties concerned. It is important, now more than ever before, that the dialogue which was initiated at El-Ayoun between Morocco and the Polisario Front should resume and continue at an authoritative level. Algeria, for its part, hopes that the two parties will choose the path of reason and that will do all in their power to resolve outstanding questions in a serious manner and without delay, thus promoting the holding of a free and orderly referendum on self-determination for the people of Western Sahara. Algeria is convinced that a just a lasting solution to the question of Western Sahara can promote stability and peace in the region. We therefore hope that the international community, as well as the United Nations and its Secretary-General, will redouble efforts to ensure, in the best conditions of credibility and impartiality, implementation of the United Nations settlement plan, with the complete cooperation of the two parties. Forty-eighth session - 5 October l993 13 The same applies to the Mediterranean region. In fact, Algeria has always worked to make that region, with the participation of all the States concerned, one of peace, stability and mutually advantageous cooperation. It is to this end that we continue to work for the consolidation and deepening of political agreement in our region and for the establishment of new types of cooperation. Algeria is therefore making constant efforts to have the forum of \"5 + 5\" activated, as is a promising framework for cooperation between North and South in the Mediterranean. this It is in the field of disarmament that the end of the cold war has produced tangible results most rapidly. However, considerable work remains to be done, especially by the nuclear Powers. The final cessation of nuclear testing in all environments and the renunciation of the development of new weapon systems are objectives the attainment of which is now within the reach of the international community - provided, of course, that the nuclear Powers go beyond current agreements and summon up the necessary political will for this purpose. In this context, Algeria notes with interest and with hope the proposals made from this rostrum on 27 September by the President of the United States of America. The complete elimination of all weapons of mass destruction is, in fact, part of the logic of history. The conclusion of the Convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons has shown that this objective is no longer Utopian. Any approach to the question of disarmament and international security and, in the final analysis, to the question of peace should be universal in scope. This is a conviction that is being reiterated time after time by Algeria and by the Non-Aligned Movement. Disarmament, if it is to be lasting, must take account of all aspects of the situation, and not of the military dimension alone. It is now clear that, in an increasingly interdependent world, peace and security cannot be dissociated from their natural corollaries - socio-economic development and the promotion of all human rights. The protection and promotion of human rights - all human rights - is a high priority for Algeria. Therefore, we are pleased at the positive results of the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna, which expressed support for an integrated and global approach to human rights, whose civil, political, economic and social aspects reinforce and complement each other. Algeria, which subscribes completely to this view and endorses this approach, is now at a juncture that makes it an obligation of the State to give priority to human rights, to protection of the fundamental right to life and to personal security. In this context, the restoration of public order and the struggle against terrorism are manifestations of Algerias determination to give a firm guarantee of the development of human rights and the building of a lasting democracy based on the rule of law, the changeover of political power between parties and republican principles. to oppose, firmly This declared struggle against terrorism has an internal aspect, but it has international dimensions as well. Here we should like to make it abundantly clear that Algeria will continue utmost determination, every outside attempt at destabilization and that it will tolerate no interference in its internal affairs. It is Algerias belief that the international community must assert itself and mobilize its energy to defeat the modern barbarity of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. and with the It is therefore important for the deliberations at this session of the General Assembly vigorously to lead to the formulation of an international convention on the prevention and repression of terrorism. While a number of regional conflicts are on the way to pacification and lasting settlement, others, however, there is no peaceful, just solution in sight. In the Middle East, which has been buffeted for decades by waves of suffering and confrontation, new prospects are emerging. Algeria welcomed the recent agreement between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel and expressed the hope that it would be the first step towards an overall settlement of the Middle East conflict in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Now as in the past, Algeria which stands firmly behind the independence of decision-making by the Palestinian leaders calls upon the Palestinians to close ranks and reaffirms its support for the PLO. At this crucial stage for the future of the region, Algeria believes that the international community continues to be responsible for building peace. For that peace to be genuine and lasting, it must be comprehensive and must meet the national aspirations of the Palestinian people and restore all the territories occupied by Israel, including Al-Quds Al- Sharif. As an Arab country, Algeria, naturally, is intimately involved in the future of the Arab world. Overcoming the aftermath of the Gulf war ought to open the way to the inter-Arab reconciliation for which our peoples fervently hope. the obligations stemming from Security Council resolutions and Since Iraq has undertaken to meet fully all 14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session since international law has established the geographical basis for peaceful neigbourliness between Iraq and Kuwait, we hope that the outstanding humanitarian questions will soon be resolved so that the collective conscience of the Arab peoples may be able finally to heal itself of the scars of the Gulf war. My country reaffirms its support for the Government of the United Arab Emirates in its legitimate efforts to regain sovereignty over the three islands under illegal foreign occupation. Algeria welcomes with hope the positive developments in South Africa, despite the continuing violence and other factors that endanger peace. The agreement to set up the Transitional Executive Council holds promise for the speedy achievement of a united, democratic, non-racial South Africa. Chairman Nelson Mandelas call from this rostrum for the lifting of economic sanctions against South Africa is further testimony to his lofty sense of responsibility and an illustration of the progress that has been achieved in the peaceful dismantling of apartheid. This development deserves the full attention of the international community, which should spare no effort in contributing to putting an end to the inter-ethnic violence and to provide the means by which the democratic forces can participate effectively in the long-awaited elections. Algeria also follows attentively developments in several fraternal African countries. We encourage the peace efforts of the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the relevant subregional organizations. We note with satisfaction the progress achieved in Mozambique, Rwanda and Liberia, and express the hope that those countries will overcome their problems with the help of the international community and devote all their energy to reconstruction and development. We hope that peace and harmony will be restored in Angola in accordance with the agreements reached between the two parties and with the resolutions of the Security Council, which have clearly determined where the responsibilities lie. We are gravely concerned about the ongoing violence in Somalia, particularly in Mogadishu. It reminds us that humanitarian assistance and promoting political solutions must go hand in hand. The tragedy of Somalia is the most telling symbol to date of Africas marginalization in international relations, and it attests to the tragic effects of the international communitys inadequate response to Africas clear needs with respect to economic and social development. by the community, international The tragedy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a challenge to the worlds conscience. In spite of the Security Councils the acquisition of territory by force, many resolutions, \"ethnic cleansing\" and trampling of all the norms of international law continue to prevail there. In the absence of firm action the dismemberment of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a State Member of the United Nations, continues unabated, and puts at risk the peace and stability of that country and of the region as a whole. Algeria expresses its solidarity with the Bosnian people, and most particularly with its Muslims, who have been the victim of untold hardships. We appeal to the international community to reject the fait accompli imposed by aggression and help protect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The international situation is not disturbing at the political and security levels alone but is also causing concern because of the deteriorating economic situation of the developing countries, and the grave instability brought about by profound changes in international economic relations. the persistence of world recession, At a time when our interdependent world is in the midst of a complex and perilous historic transition, the communication gap between North and South must come to an end. The universal imperative of peace, security and development makes us consider the developing situation in the countries of the South. Most of them are facing the challenges of globalization with economies made uniquely vulnerable by the crushing weight of foreign indebtedness, their precarious internal balance and a highly unfavourable international economic environment. The efforts of developing countries to promote economic growth and make the structural changes necessary for development are made far more difficult and risky by the erosion of multilateral cooperation, the conflicting interests of the dominant economic players and the constraints imposed by economic decisions that are too often selfish and exclusionary. It is therefore essential to respond in a concerted fashion to the need for an orderly restructuring of international economic relations by establishing coordinated mechanisms to regulate the functioning of the world economy. In this context, it is important that the questions of debt, the scarcity of capital and technology inflows, to the countries of the South, the continued decline in commodity prices, the deterioration of the terms of trade and the difficulty of access to markets should become the focus of Forty-eighth session - 5 October l993 15 the international communitys attention in order for us to find lasting solutions to such problems. Such a collective concerted type of action that would be consonant with the requirements of adjustment by the developing countries themselves, is a must if we are to relaunch the international economy on a fair and well- balanced basis and make it possible for the developing countries to reap the expected benefits from the economic reforms they have undertaken. This would make meaningful the sacrifices being made by the developing countries in undertaking the necessary restructuring changes aimed at relaunching their economies and integrating them into the world economy. It would also make it possible for the international community to learn from the experiences acquired in debt management and structural adjustment programmes. Lastly, it would promote the creation of a true market environment in the developing countries. inconceivable without The Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro demonstrated that environmental protection is the promotion of sustainable development and sustained growth in the developing countries. We must therefore work determinedly towards achieving this objective and place sustainable development on the agenda of the new world order. The holding of a world summit on social development scheduled for 1995 to deal with problems of human security affords us an opportunity to engage in an international dialogue on the implications and results of transition in the world. The United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions must grasp these new problems and contribute to developing a new framework for reflection and guidance to direct better the evolution of the international system. This endeavour may seem difficult, but it is essential for a better understanding of this new order, which we wish to be balanced, fair and consensual. It would also tend to support the Secretary-Generals efforts to draw up an agenda for development. the reform, At a time when our Organization faces various challenges, restructuring and revitalization process now under way in the United Nations acquires special importance. Restructuring the Secretariat and the economic and social sectors, revitalizing the Economic and Social Council, relaunching the operational development activities of the United Nations system and assuring the stable and predictable growth of its resources are all tasks that should be combined to give multilateral action the utmost credibility and effectiveness. it This undertaking is part of the vast effort to equip the United Nations for and adapt to present and future challenges, and it requires participation by all of us. This endeavour is the vessel for feeding the faith of the peoples of the United Nations in an indivisible humankind. It is bound to succeed so long as our more democratic and more effective Organization is the active centre and catalyst for the promotion of fair and equitably shared development and the foundation of a peace built by mankind as a whole. Mr. SULEIMENOV (Kazakhstan) (interpretation from Russian): Allow me first of all, Sir, to associate myself with the congratulations already extended to you on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session and to wish you every success in your endeavours. On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, I should like to convey deep sympathy to the Government and the people of the friendly country of India for the heavy death toll and considerable material loss caused by the devastating earthquake on 30 September. The international realities that form the background of the current session are a direct reflection of the development of extremely contradictory tendencies within the world community. On the one hand, during the year gone by since the beginning of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly we have witnessed a dynamic development of international relations along with increased United Nations activity in the resolution of global economic, social and environmental issues and in the promotion of peace and security. The achievement of agreement on the Middle East problem should undoubtedly be counted as a breakthrough in multilateral diplomacy, but, on the other hand, we must state with regret that no agreement has been reached so far on the cessation of hostilities in the former Yugoslavia, that the tension in Somalia has increased and that hotbeds of conflicts still smoulder in a number of republics of the former Soviet Union. We have made a careful study of the Secretary- Generals report () on the work of the Organization and share its principal conclusion that in order to produce enduring results there must at all costs be a new level of political will and realism. The President of the United States, Mr. Clinton, pointed out in his statement on 27 September that the United Nations simply cannot be engaged in each and every one of the conflicts in the world. This goes without saying. But it is equally self-evident that the United Nations is today, and 16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session will remain in the foreseeable future, a body to which humanity - the worlds nations and individuals - will link their aspirations for peace, development and human rights. In these circumstances, in our opinion, a package of concrete measures aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the United Nations is called for. We believe that, along with a further definition of the functions of the United Nations main organs, the elimination of duplication in their activities and the adequate financing of United Nations peace-keeping is high time to consider the question of operations, expanding the permanent membership of the Security Council. We are confident that this measure will enable the United Nations to respond more rapidly and objectively to the new, dangerous challenges of the times and eruptions of violence, regardless of where this might happen. it The harsh realities of the post-confrontation era have highlighted the urgency of redirecting the efforts of the world community towards eliminating the potential for disputes within a State or between States to escalate into military conflicts. Should we fail to resolve disputes at an early stage, we will simply reap fruits similar to those reaped in the former Yugoslavia, Nagorny-Karabakh and Tajikistan. This reaffirms once again the appropriateness of the idea of preventive by Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in his report \"An Agenda for Peace\". Only by taking a series of preventive measures based on global and regional cooperation between nations can peace be ensured and maintained. formulated diplomacy This is at the heart of the idea of creating a system of collective security in Asia within the framework of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia (CICMA). As is known, this initiative was formulated comprehensively by Mr. Nazarbaev, President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, precisely one year ago, at the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. To promote the realization of the initiative, Kazakhstan hosted two rounds of expert-level meetings within the framework of preparations for CICMA, which took place this year in Almaty and yielded promising results. At present, 25 Asian States are involved in the CICMA process. I take this opportunity to invite other States interested in strengthening confidence-building measures in Asia to join our efforts. I believe that today we should actively broaden our efforts to define the problems related to this initiative. I have in mind particularly the preparations for the conference of Foreign Ministers of Asian States which, in the view of experts, could be convened in 1994. been endorsed by has in Asia We note with satisfaction that the idea of regional cooperation the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and has found a broad response within the United Nations, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the League of Arab States. This positive reaction to our initiative fills us with confidence in its viability and its significance for the cause of peace in Asia. the members of Indeed, the States of the Asian region have an equally strong interest in the prevention and peaceful settlement of conflicts as well as in the prevention of the emergence of new hotbeds of regional and global tension. As an example I would mention the formation of the Defence Coalition Forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which acted as a restraining factor in the Tajik conflict. Joint military units of Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan managed to reduce considerably the scale of military confrontation, saved the lives of thousands of civilians and provided relief for hundreds of thousands of refugees. In this context, the Republic other Commonwealth States, is asking for support for our joint appeal to recognize the Defence Coalition Forces of the CIS as the United Nations peacemaking force in that region. of Kazakhstan, along with the is the coordination of Another important aspect of close cooperation between Asian States their efforts on environmental issues. The severe environmental problems of Kazakhstan are well known. The first among them is the problem of the Aral Sea. The critical situation in the Aral region has frequently been discussed at various international conferences and meetings of Heads of States. As a result, we now have a sizeable package of documents defining short-term and strategic solutions to the problem. We point in particular to the signing of the Agreement on Joint Activities in Preserving the Aral Sea and the Environmental Rehabilitation of the International Fund for Preserving the Aral Sea. However, we are convinced that this environmental tragedy has effects far beyond the confines of the region. Today, only the collective efforts of the world community can bring about a solution to this problem. We therefore support the proposal put forward by the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Mr. Karimov, to set up a special United Nations forum, perhaps a United Nations commission on the Aral Sea. the Region and the Statute of Another priority in the foreign policy of our Republic is the strengthening of intergovernmental relations within the CIS. We are confident that at present no member State of the Commonwealth is able effectively to pursue its internal Forty-eighth session - 5 October l993 17 and foreign policy in isolation from the policies of the other members of the CIS. In this context, the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Mr. Nazarbaev, has repeatedly proposed concrete measures to consolidate the common economic space and ensure social and political stability on a collective basis. At the recent meeting of the Heads of State of the CIS in Moscow, an economic union of the Commonwealth was set up for the purpose of coordinating the policies of member States in various fields. This serves the interests of all members of the CIS. Kazakhstan will remain active in promoting the integration of the members of the CIS. We strongly believe that all emerging political problems and conflict situations should be resolved in constructive and civilized ways. This idea is the essence of two recent statements by President Nazarbaev on the current critical situation in the Russian Federation. Our State has a diversified foreign policy, and the expansion of cooperation in all fields with all countries is of utmost strategic importance to us. After signing the Lisbon Protocol of 23 May 1992, the Republic of Kazakhstan, along with other States successors to the USSR, was recognized as a party to the START I Treaty and undertook to accede to the non-proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear State. At present, negotiations are under way with a number of States on cooperation in assisting Kazakhstan to meet its commitments to eliminate strategic offensive weapons. In this context, I share the opinion of my Ukrainian colleague, Mr. Zlenko, about the extreme complexity of this In our opinion, Kazakhstan would need problem. considerable funds for this purpose: approximately $2 billion - not an easy sum to find in our national budget. These funds are needed not only to cover the dismantling of nuclear weapons, but also to eliminate the consequences of nuclear tests at the Semipalatinsk Testing Ground and to solve the Aral sea crisis as well. One of the active areas of Kazakhstans foreign policy is cooperation with the CSCE and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. The possibilities of Kazakhstans more regular and active participation in CSCE activities were discussed in particular with the CSCE Chairman, Margaretha af Ugglas, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden, during a visit of the CSCE delegation to Almaty last June. life, a fact Broadly speaking, our foreign policy can now be described as dynamic and active. Kazakhstans membership of the United Nations has allowed it to become actively involved in international reflected in our membership now of 20 international organizations, including the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and others. The Republics membership in the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) and other international organizations is under consideration. the Economic Kazakhstans internal reforms are being carried out in accordance with the international treaties to which it has acceded. In spite of major economic problems, which are common in varying degrees to the States of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, a strong legal basis for economic reforms has been laid down in our Republic. The laws passed by the Kazakhstan Parliament are designed to develop medium- and small-scale business, attract and protect foreign investments and liberalize foreign trade. Providing a legal basis for foreign economic activity envisages a gradual decrease of export and import duties and the removal of free trade barriers which had to be imposed during the transition period because of the particular features of that time. Of course, such transformations will take more than one or two years, but Kazakhstan intends to carry them out as soon as possible. at the of tests nuclear Referring to the problem of the elimination of the consequences now-closed Semipalatinsk Testing Ground, I should like to draw the Assemblys attention to the enormous damage to the health of the people of a vast region wrought by 466 nuclear tests in all environments. In varying degrees, almost half a million Kazakh citizens have suffered the deadly effects of nuclear tests. It is quite understandable, therefore, that Kazakhstan wholeheartedly supports a comprehensive and complete ban on nuclear tests. Kazakhstan has now begun to attract international business. Following deals with Chevron and other major foreign companies, which have demonstrated to the world business community that Kazakhstan is anxious to attract foreign investment on a mutually beneficial basis and ensure a favourable environment foreign investment into the Republics economy has been growing steadily, and this is raising our hopes for the ultimate success of our reforms. the flow of for it, 18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session participated in the promotion of international relations, contributed to the strengthening of processes of integration, and has offered its own ideas on how to improve the United Nations. readiness to make We reaffirm our an active contribution to the work of the Organization and to support all endeavours aimed at enhancing international cooperation and achieving peace and international accord. At the same time I should like particularly to point out that the United Nations today is an international forum of 184 Member States, including those which, like Kazakhstan, only recently gained their independence. Considerable expansion of the membership over the past few years has, in our view, broadened the range and diversity of opinion within the Organization as well as pluralism in approaches to the analysis of international political events. To achieve consensus today we need a collective search for new principles of coexistence of States in the United Nations, as well as the improvement The Constitution of We understand clearly that now, at a time when our Republic is reaching out to the world community and is declaring its willingness to join it as an equal and respected member, it is of particular importance for us to affirm our compliance with internationally recognized standards of the Republic of human rights. Kazakhstan adopted in January 1993 recognizes, in accordance with international standards, the primacy of rights and freedoms of the individual and places the primacy of the interests of the individual above the interests of the State and society, proclaims the ideas of civil peace and ethnic accord, and the equality of all nations and ethnic groups living in the Republic. I wish to draw attention to the fact that Kazakhstan is the only one of the newly formed States of the former USSR where national radio and TV programmes are broadcast languages, newspapers and magazines are published in seven languages and instruction in schools is given in 18 languages. in six different Kazakhstans commitment to equal rights for all ethnic groups in economic and social development was clearly stated at the World Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna last June. The documents adopted at that Conference will undoubtedly serve as an important guarantee of the observance of human rights both at the international and at the national levels. However, the practical realization of human rights and freedoms is a long and gradual process which depends on many factors such as the level of economic and political development of the society, the ideological priorities, the national mentality, and so on. It is therefore unjustifiable for some people to assume the responsibility for setting human rights standards and to use their own interpretation of the concept as an instrument of pressure on certain countries in questions related to bilateral or multilateral relations. In this context, Kazakhstan, while supporting efforts to affirm the universal nature of human rights, believes that it is necessary to take into account the specific national conditions of each member of the world community. The problem of human rights is not only pressing but also delicate, and hence it requires an extremely careful and balanced approach. It is this understanding which drives the internal ethnic policy of our country, a State the very stability of which depends upon the peaceful and mutually respectful coexistence of ethnic groups. The forty-eighth session of the General Assembly is the second one in which Kazakhstan has participated as a full Member of the United Nations. Despite such recent membership in the Organization, Kazakhstan has actively Forty-eighth session - 5 October l993 19 and adaptation of the Organization to the rapidly changing realities of modern life. It is for this reason that we call upon all States Members of the United Nations to consider our proposal to convene a special session of the General Assembly devoted to the problems of strengthening international peace and security, expanding the scope and potential of preventive diplomacy, promoting human rights, and enhancing the role of the United Nations in an interdependent and integrated world. We believe that on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations it would be extremely useful to discuss new goals and the challenges facing the Organization"}}
