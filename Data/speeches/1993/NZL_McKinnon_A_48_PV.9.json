{"speech":{"0":" The United Nations is our Organization; we are its custodians, and we have to adjust to change. We have a huge responsibility to pass it on in better shape than we found it. Historians in future years will acknowledge this period of radical change. But what are the objectives of this Organization of ours in 1993? Well, they are not very difficult to enumerate, because they are set out for us and by us in the Preamble to the Charter, and they remain as valid today as they were when they were agreed in 1945. The first, of course, is peace, because without peace and security no human society can flourish; then human dignity, because if we do not treat each other with respect as individuals, we will not do so as nations; justice, because unless relations between nations are grounded in law, the powerful will always be able to triumph over the weak; social and economic progress, because without the sustained and sustainable development of our economies, all our other achievements will be as nothing. I believe that to this list we must now add the maintenance of a clean and attractive environment. We are learning, painfully, that our planet also has rights. We ignore them only at our peril. These are the foundations for the vision of what the world should be. In New Zealand, we would say that they give opportunities to all. When the United Nations came into existence almost 50 years ago, the vision was sharper than the reality, but the founders of the United Nations were certainly not deterred. They were at the watershed in the affairs of the world. They had just experienced the awful reality of a global conflict in which millions had died, and they were determined to do everything in their power to make sure that such a conflict could never occur again. They did build well. They embodied their vision not only in this Organization but also in a whole series of economic, financial, social and humanitarian institutions, and they gave it the only strength that counted: their sheer determination, as men and women from very different countries, to make it happen. Only the utmost patience and perseverance has kept that dream and that determination alive through most of the 50 years since 1945. Progress has been slow and it has been halting. Some great things were done, but too often the Members of the United Nations could agree only at the lowest common denominator, a reflection of the political gaps and strains within the United Nations membership. There are, however, four reasons why I believe that that long, grey era has closed. The first is that the cold war, that shadow and threat of a global conflict, is now over. Freed of that constraint, the United Nations can operate, as it was intended that it should, as the ultimate guardian of the security of all its Members, the ultimate arbiter of world peace. Secondly, democracy, one of the most effective guarantors of peace between nations, is spreading. We welcome the establishment of democratic institutions and processes in countries that have for too long been without them. The third point is that in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, the world has a major opportunity to turn its back on protectionism and lock in the prospects for economic growth through trade and other forms of economic integration. Freedom and free trade go hand in hand. Fourthly, and last, the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and Agenda 21 contain a global consensus, a universal determination to act to preserve our environment. This combination of developments marks a new watershed; if we are to keep faith with the founders of this Organization, we must do what they did in 1945 at their watershed, and build well, not just for ourselves, but of course for those who follow. On the issue of security and peacemaking, the first point that I raised was that the elimination of confrontation between the super-Powers has opened up new possibilities for the practice of collective security and peacemaking. The unfortunate consequence of 50 years of super-Power confrontation is, paradoxically, that we are not yet very good at working together: like a novice sports team, we are really rather uncoordinated, sadly lacking in strategy, sadly lacking in team skills or knowledge of the new rules, and sadly lacking in collective determination. We cannot correct these deficiencies overnight, but we must keep on trying to improve. Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 39 The other paradox is that peace has not broken out simply because the former Soviet Union and the United States have stopped squaring off against each other. There have been unexpected consequences: some would liken the result to taking the lid off a pressure-cooker. Conflicts, internal and between neighbours, seem to have burst out everywhere. These consequences, in human terms, are horrific. So here we are, in the United Nations, underresourced, undertrained and facing an enormous peacemaking, peace- building and peace-keeping challenge. We really have no alternative to learning as we go, and I believe that we are doing so. During the past year, I have spoken to soldiers and relief workers in the field in United Nations missions as widely spread as Somalia and Croatia, and I pay my highest tribute to their dedication under some of the most adverse circumstances. United Nations people are trying there, as elsewhere, to create conditions where their work will ultimately no longer be required. They are actually trying to do themselves out of a job. The Secretary-Generals document \"An Agenda for Peace\" is now in a consolidation phase. The problems are clear: rising expectations; machinery due for reform; lack of funds; and the lack of ready, well-trained and well-equipped forces. Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has already made some thoughtful proposals, including sending teams to Member States to help identify in advance resources available for the United Nations operations. New Zealand is willing to respond positively to this approach. Mr. HAN (Republic of Korea), Vice-President, took the Chair. The Secretary-General has also made organizational changes in the Headquarters departments that support peace- keeping. The revamping of the Department of Peace- Keeping Operations is a very good start, providing we recognize that we need more than just a shifting of the resources. The new philosophy of peace-building and peacemaking must work in tandem with the well-tried and successful peace-keeping philosophy of the past. On the issue of safety and security of United Nations personnel, recent peace-keeping operations have highlighted the risks to United Nations personnel working in dangerous and unstable situations. That does not help the recruitment of peace-keepers, and it does not help the recruitment of contributing countries. The United Nations must have the means to hold personally responsible and accountable those who attack or commit other acts of violence against the United Nations and associated personnel. Earlier this year the New Zealand Government took the initial step of calling for all possible measures to ensure the safety of United Nations personnel. We asked the Secretary- General to report on the adequacy of existing arrangements. His report makes a number of positive recommendations. He has highlighted the need for the General Assembly to elaborate a new multilateral instrument on the role the Security Council might play in setting the appropriate conditions designed to improve the safety of personnel. I was very pleased just this afternoon to participate in a Security Council meeting that adopted a resolution welcoming the Secretary-Generals report and spelling out the conditions the Council will impose in the future for the protection of United Nations personnel. I was also delighted that the General Assembly last week agreed to New Zealands proposal to include a new item on the safety of personnel the Sixth Committee will establish a working group to consider the issue and make urgent progress. I hope the subject will also be very fully discussed in all other relevant United Nations bodies. in this years agenda. I hope that Of course, any mechanisms for protecting peace-keepers must also require that parties to any conflict respect the integrity of those personnel that have been deployed on their behalf. Such an undertaking should, in principle, form part of the mandate for any peace-keeping operation. The recent the Security Council of establishing clear practice of mandates for peace-keeping operations at the outset of deployment is especially welcome, but there remains an onus on a host State both to explain carefully to its people the reason for the United Nations presence and also to take active steps to ensure the safety of United Nations personnel. But the purpose of peace-keeping or peacemaking and peace-building is not solely to deal with conflicts that have already arisen, urgent though that task is. We must improve our capacity to prevent conflicts before they break out, and I should like to acknowledge here the importance and timeliness of recent improvements in conflict-resolution mechanisms and the ongoing work on preventive diplomacy. I welcome very warmly the contribution made by my Australian colleague, Senator Gareth Evans, to the debate on this subject. He has given us much food for thought and some helpful suggestions for concrete steps we can take to improve our performance in this area. 40 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session Disarmament measures remain a key element in conflict prevention. This year, as the international community moves towards the extension - I hope for an indefinite period - of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Assembly will have non-proliferation as one of its major themes. In this regard, North Koreas continued evasion of its responsibilities under that Treaty demands a firm international response. the launching of negotiations We welcome very strongly the restraint being shown by the nuclear-weapon States on testing and their positive attitude towards for a comprehensive test-ban treaty. It is not before time. New Zealand has sponsored a draft resolution on comprehensive test-bans for many years. Its purpose now is on the brink of fulfillment. The subject needs to be taken up in the Conference on Disarmament. Given the importance of the tasks now on the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament, membership of the Conference must be open to all who have the will to participate constructively. In respect of conventional weaponry, we applaud the enhancement of controls through the commencement of the Register of conventional-arms transfers. We now have a chemical weapons Convention in place alongside the biological weapons Convention. both regions will give a new cast deliberations. to the Assemblys We can also take heart from progress on another front of long-standing concern to the Assembly. The United Nations is now three years into the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. The good news is that we are already seeing evidence that the goals and objectives of the United Nations in this area are almost completely realized. The number of Self-Governing Territories on the United Nations list is now very small, and many of these are exploring innovative ways to complete the decolonization process. The recent United Nations Seminar on Colonialism, held in Papua-New Guinea in June, confirmed this trend. It also revealed that in some cases some very small Non-Self- Governing Territories do not want fundamental constitutional change thrust upon them. New Zealand has always been a strong advocate of the principle that in all cases decisions on self-determination are, of course, for the local people to make. We are comfortable with the notion that certain Territories, such as the Tokelaus, may finally choose to develop concepts of self-government and free association that further develop models that have already been successfully employed for other very small former Territories. It is timely to consider what similar work can be done in respect of conventional weapons. As disarmament moves from the realms of Utopia into the achievable, we must lend every effort, here in the United Nations and outside it, to ensure disarmaments more rapid progress. No sensible proposal should be discarded simply for outdated ideological reasons. In that connection, and consistent with New Zealands principled approach to all matters of decolonization, I am pleased to confirm that the New Zealand Government and the people of the Tokelaus have extended an invitation to the United Nations to send a further visiting mission to the Tokelaus early in 1994 to meet local leaders and, of course, discuss recent developments. I believe, one of The spread of democratic institutions to every corner of the globe is, the most encouraging phenomena of recent years, and the pace is astonishing. In the space of just 24 hours last week, the Parliament of Israel approved a Declaration of Principles on Palestinian self- government; the Parliament of South Africa enacted legislation establishing the Transitional Executive Council to take charge of that country until a democratically elected Government is in office; and a constitutional Government took office in Cambodia. We welcome these historic events and the promise they hold for a more just and prosperous existence for the peoples of those nations. As delegations will remember, the Middle East and South Africa dominated the political agenda of the Assembly for many years. These positive developments in It Democracy is a sure foundation for peace between nations. is the political expression of that universal respect for human rights to which we are all committed. The Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action arising out of this years World Conference on Human Rights gives some direction to steps the Organization can take to strengthen the observance of human rights. I believe we should move quickly to approve a high commissioner for human rights. The United Nations needs an officer with a mandate to play a constructive role in preventing, monitoring and alleviating human rights abuses throughout the world. The Centre for Human Rights should be given the resources to match the immense task it will have before it. There is a clear need for an enhanced programme of advisory services and technical assistance to Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 41 help countries build up their national human rights infrastructure. Human rights is also about recognizing the rights of In this, the International Year for peoples to self-identity. the Worlds Indigenous People, I would like to support a proposal the United Nations declare a decade for indigenous peoples. We need to build on what has been achieved, first at Rio de Janeiro and subsequently during the International Year world wide. This is a long-term task. It will require a sustained and very coordinated effort. that just task is not Unhappily, our to enhance the observance of human rights. In this last decade of the twentieth century, we seem at times to be actually moving backwards, witnessing the abuse and deprivation of human rights on a scale that we really believed we had put a long way behind us. The suffering of millions of refugees displaced by conflict is beyond our comprehension but cannot and should not be beyond our compassion. This dimension is starkly evident in nearly every issue now before the Security Council. Last June, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees put the figure at 19 million people - 19 million displaced people around the world - and it continues to rise. from Bosnia, Somalia It is appropriate to pay a special tribute to Mrs. Ogata and her staff for the way in which they are meeting, often in dangerous and trying circumstances, the challenges which this problem brings. New Zealand has responded to these increased demands by making a special provision for refugees by establishing special programmes for particularly vulnerable groups, such as women at risk, and by providing aid. We now have one of the highest per capita resettlement ratios in the world. But this is, of course, addressing the symptoms, not the cause. The ultimate objective must be to create or recreate conditions that allow refugees to return in safety and dignity to their own homes and homelands. and Cambodia Nor can we neglect the need to bring to justice those who have brought about such suffering. The establishment of a war crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is certainly a central pillar in the international response to this particular conflict. The full achievement of the Tribunals mandate is of the highest priority. At the same time, and in a broader context, New Zealand also welcomes the consideration being given to the creation of an international criminal court. We would like to see further progress on this issue made during this session of the Assembly. Sustainable economic growth for all countries is essential for stability and peace in the world. A principal determinant for that is an open, healthy and international trading system, a system that encourages closer economic relations and strengthened North-South exchanges. There is no greater assistance developed countries can give to the developing countries than to open their markets. A satisfactory conclusion to the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations would be of immense benefit to us all and has been mentioned, I believe, by just about every speaker on this rostrum during this debate. Progress to that end in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, of course, has been slow, as we know. Many deadlines have come and many deadlines have gone without resolution. We should not be under any illusion. Come this December, after seven years of negotiations on the Uruguay Round, either we will have the liberalization of multilateral trade with a benefit to all or the prospects of avoiding global economic warfare will have suffered the most serious setback. The New Zealand Government sees the purpose of these negotiations being to lock in place today the politically attainable, and to build on what might be possible tomorrow. In preparing for that, we also have to focus our attention on what is needed to ensure that all countries are placed where they can reap the benefits of the future. We still have much to follow up from the Rio Conference on Environment and Development. But time is not on our side. Environmental degradation continues to pose a serious threat to the planet and its resources, and no country - no country - is immune from its impact. The levels of responsibility for environmental damage may differ from country to country, but we must face up to their consequences together. We must meet the objectives of Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration. All countries should move to ratify the climate and biodiversity Conventions, a step that New Zealand took just recently. New Zealand will contribute to the global environmental facility that is to fund both of those Conventions. We have begun work to reduce carbon a comprehensive strategy for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions. We are also making excellent progress on phasing out consumption of ozone-depleting chemicals. New Zealand is ready to share its expertise on biological diversity with other countries to assist them in meeting obligations under the Conventions. developing emissions dioxide and are I suppose that one of the most useful exercises that we can conclude here is to draw some lessons from the experiences and views that I have set out. The most obvious 42 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session economic well-being and a good, one to me is that, however important it is to deal with the particularities of human aspirations for peace, respect for the individual, clean environment, one should never lose sight of the connections between them all. The Secretary-General has pointed out how peace, development and democracy form a mutually reinforcing circle, and we agree. Getting the linkages right can be as important for success as the elements of each. Peace and security are not likely to be soundly based if people are hungry. Economic growth cannot last if the natural resources used to create it are not conserved. People are not likely to make the effort required by economic restructuring if the important choices are made for them. Economic growth cannot be sustained if countries keep coming up with new pretexts, such as environmental protection, to justify excluding outside competition from their own markets. Human aspirations and human security must be seen in the round. That is one of the major challenges facing the membership of this Organization. The work done by the United Nations in post-peace-keeping situations, I believe, deserves renewed attention. For those countries where there is still a need to foster economic, political and social development, we should look at establishing a partnership arrangement between the United Nations and the sovereign Government. A coordinating body comprising the Governments and a group of friends of the Secretariat could help to ensure that the gains of peace-keeping are taken through to reconstruction. I believe that we need a new institutional framework to graduate problems out of the security area and into a forum more able to cope with the needs of redevelopment and reconstruction. The second lesson is that we need to keep looking at how well the United Nations is fitted to meet the challenges it is facing and be prepared to change it where necessary. Membership of the United Nations has continued to grow and I warmly welcome the newest Member States. Many speakers have referred to Security Council reform. The Security Council is in need of early reform. We support a modest increase in membership and a fresh look at the institution as a whole. The possibility of some members representing regional groupings for, say, a 10-year period is worth considering. New Zealand will continue to oppose any extension of veto rights. Another imperative is for the Councils work methods to be improved. Wider consultation with the broader membership of the United Nations is essential. United Nations agencies are also ripe for restructuring. The General Assembly has made a good start on itself. We have streamlined the Committees, but we also must streamline the overall workload. It is unmanageable at present. For several years now, we have been looking hard at ways to fund new demands on the Organization by making compensating savings elsewhere. We still need to ask hard questions about whether all that has been done traditionally still needs to be done. I welcome the fact that the Secretary- Generals budget proposals already envisage some major steps in this area. He has also identified better contracting as a source of further savings. At the end of the day, however, all that can be done to increase efficiency and cut costs will come to naught if the financial commitment by Member States is lacking. New Zealand pays its dues on time; most others do not. I urge them to do so. Let us certainly go on talking about financial reform, but let us also secure the financial basis of the Organization while we are doing so. But what is the real dream that all of us have? I would urge all members to keep making, from year to year, real progress towards satisfying those basic human aspirations I mentioned at the outset and to do so with a strong, well- equipped and well-focused United Nations. Specifically, I want to see a reshaped Security Council, a more tightly focused General Assembly, better peace-keeping practice, a Secretariat equipped to handle peace-building and partnership arrangements, and financial arrangements built on efficiency and punctuality. Would that not give a point to the fiftieth anniversary celebrations that lie ahead in 1995, and would it not make the United Nations of the next 50 years a more effective, more dynamic and exciting place to do the worlds business in than the conditions of the last 50 years have allowed? The deprived of this world expect no less. The well-off know the world is too small for the huge gap that now exists amongst all people to remain. Mr. DOSSOU (Benin) (interpretation from French): On behalf of the delegation of Benin and on behalf of the Government and the people of Benin, I should like to extend my warm congratulations to Ambassador Insanally on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. His unanimous election as leader of our deliberations testifies to his abilities; is also represents an honour for his country and draws attention to the role played by Caribbean countries in the international arena. it I take this opportunity to extend my sincere congratulations to his predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, who Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 43 ably presided over the work of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. It is also a great pleasure and a privilege for me to pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United Nations, who effectively and successfully heads this global Organization and who is working intensively to restore peace and security to the various hotbeds of tension throughout the world. The delegation of Benin solemnly welcomes the new States that have joined the world community to make their contribution to respect for the common basic values of the new society which together, we, the people of the world, are endeavouring to build. I welcome the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Eritrea, the Principality of Monaco and the Principality of Andorra, whose admission enhances the universality of this Organization. We are meeting here, as we do each year under similar to consider together ways and means of circumstances, promoting peace and prosperity for all our peoples. Since the last session of the General Assembly, we have witnessed many important events that have given the international community as a whole new prospects and new challenges in its quest for peace. We welcome the fact that the confrontation between the two blocs, which for so long had created political tension, has today been replaced by the universal values of democracy and equality in international relations. These values are interdependent with economic and social development and with the security of all States. It is also encouraging to see that renewed confidence in the effectiveness of the United Nations in settling conflicts has strengthened the credibility and the capacity to act of the Organization, opening up new areas in which it is able to encourage the settlement of a vast range of problems that afflict humankind. In just five years, the tasks of the Organization in the area of maintaining peace have increased and widened considerably. Despite positive developments, changes currently under way that were designed to provide for greater freedom and encourage the establishment of more just and more dynamic societies have unfortunately also become the source of new challenges and even greater uncertainty in international relations. Each day, in one place or another on our planet, civil wars, territorial partition, ethnic confrontations and tribal or religious struggles demand the urgent intervention of the United Nations. We can see, therefore, how difficult is the task of the Organization, which is obliged to respect a fragile balance between the sovereignty of States and the duty to intervene. the political has picture In Europe, changed dramatically in just a few years. The hopes born of the disappearance of the Berlin Wall have been virtually dashed by another, anachronistic war in the former Yugoslavia and by the situation in some of the States that emerged from the disintegration of the Soviet Union, thus threatening stability and security on the old continent. In Africa, major civil wars continue to rage. These wars are responsible for the untold suffering and destruction which are hampering efforts at socio-economic development and recovery in our continent. Africa needs peace and security. Without them the the courageous and far-reaching reforms undertaken at political and economic levels cannot be successful. The twenty-ninth summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) held in Cairo in June of this year provided us with an opportunity to adopt a mechanism for the prevention, management and settlement of conflicts. That mechanism is an important step forward in the acceptance of the to development. Indeed, conflict management remains a major concern for our countries, as the massive movements of refugees that result from conflicts distract us, to our sorrow, from the paramount task of development. imperative of peace, which is so essential West Africa, which until now has been a peaceful land of asylum, welcoming refugees from the rest of the continent and even beyond, is now living through a particularly difficult time, with an unprecedented increase in emergency situations and in the number of refugees, which in less than four years has risen from 20,000 to 1.2 million. Here, I would pay a tribute to the humanitarian activities and the considerable efforts of the United Nations to settle conflicts in Africa and elsewhere in the world. Because of the support of the United Nations, the Liberian conflict today offers encouraging prospects for a peaceful and lasting settlement. The major protagonists in 44 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session They met representatives of the Liberian tragedy now seem disposed towards dialogue in Geneva from 10 to and agreement. 17 July 1993, with the help of the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity and the Executive Secretariat of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and of the Acting President of that Community, to seek ways and means of silencing the weapons of war and restoring peace to their country. Those present at the Geneva meeting successfully prepared a comprehensive agreement that takes account of all aspects of the Liberian tragedy. In Cotonou on 25 July 1993, representatives of the various factions and of the interim Government of Liberia signed that peace agreement, thanks to the mediation of Mr. Nicephore Soglo, President of the Republic of Benin, and Acting President of ECOWAS. Benin is pleased by the willingness of our Liberian brothers to enter into this agreement and by their spirit of constructive and fraternal dialogue, without which nothing positive could have been achieved. Benin continues to believe that dialogue is the only way of restoring peace to this war-torn country. We welcome the positive results thus far achieved in the implementation of the agreement, most notably the observation of the cease-fire by all the warring factions and the cessation of hostilities. In particular, the delegation of Benin welcomes the unanimous adoption by the Security Council of resolution 856 (1993), which supports the efforts of ECOWAS and approves the deployment in Liberia of an advance team of 30 military observers to participate in the work of the Joint Cease-fire Monitoring Committee. We also welcome resolution 866 (1993), which establishes the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL). This Mission can be made possible only by a mobilization of the international community to support the efforts of ECOWAS by, inter alia, contributing to the special trust fund, which would facilitate the dispatch of reinforcements to ECOMOG by the African States and help provide for the upkeep of the contingents made available to ECOMOG by the participating States, as well as by helping in carrying out the work of removing mines, providing humanitarian and developmental assistance and promoting the healthy evolution of the electoral process. The three signatories of the 25 July 1993 peace agreement met in Cotonou from 15 to 18 August 1993 to set up the Council of State, the transitional executive body. The 25 July peace agreement promises finally to put an end to the very long, devastating war in Liberia. From this rostrum, I would like to make an appeal to all the parties who signed that agreement, urging them to continue to abide by the commitments entered into during the Cotonou talks and to work with ECOWAS and the United Nations for the proper and swift implementation of those commitments, in order to put an end to the suffering the national of reconciliation process will proceed to its successful completion. the Liberian people and ensure that Along the lines of the solution under way in Liberia, we should work to ensure that peace returns to Somalia, Angola, the Sudan and Mozambique. In Angola, for example, despite the great hopes and expectations aroused by the agreements reached in Estoril, Portugal, we are seriously disturbed and deeply saddened by the resumption of hostilities following the refusal of UNITA to recognize the results of the free elections of 29 and 30 September 1992. Benin welcomes the change in the position taken by the United States Government, which has now granted diplomatic recognition to the legal Government of Angola. This action by the Clinton Administration strengthens the position of the international community in support of the verdict of the ballot box rather than the compulsion of the gun. In South Africa, developments are encouraging. The multipartite talks made it possible to reach an agreement on, the establishment of a transitional executive inter alia, council and the holding of the first democratic and non-racial elections in the history of South Africa, scheduled for 27 April 1994. The Government of Benin supports the courageous and responsible appeal by the Chairman of the African National Congress, Mr. Nelson Mandela, before the Special Committee against Apartheid in this prestigious Hall of the General Assembly on 24 September 1993. He invited the international community to lift all economic sanctions against South Africa, except for the arms embargo. Given the positive development that will lead this country, which is undergoing a process of the principle of \"one man, one vote\", the time has come for all Members of our universal Organization to support the peaceful transformation of South Africa. to implement reform, Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 45 Benin wishes to see the African continent free itself of all fratricidal and internal wars, of all conflicts that impede its development. It is my firm hope that the logic of war will now progressively yield to the logic of peace and development in Africa. Benin, which is dedicated to peace and economic and social progress, urges the international community to refrain from any military use of science so that science can be devoted to development, and international peace and security. Turning to the Middle East, 26 years after Israels occupation of the Arab territories, Benin cannot but greet with joy the historic agreement between the Israeli Government and the Palestine Liberation Organization granting autonomy to Gaza and Jericho. That agreement marks the beginning of a just and lasting peace that will allow every State in the region, including Palestine and Israel, to live within secure and internationally recognized borders guaranteed by the international community. Our duty is thus to encourage the two essential parties, as well as all parties involved, to undertake or to continue the dialogue necessary for a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. In the Persian Gulf region the full restoration of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait helped to reaffirm the fundamental principles governing inter-State relations. In this connection we sincerely hope that Security Council resolution 833 (1993), on the demarcation of the international border between Iraq and Kuwait, will be respected by all States. Pending issues such as that of the Kuwaiti prisoners of war must be settled so as to open the way to fraternity, cooperation and solidarity in that subregion. The atmosphere of relaxation of tension which began with the end of the cold war and which has made possible a new spirit of consensus, inter alia in the Security Council, is still rather uncertain for much remains to be done to consolidate peace. We must recognize today that the idea of peace can no longer be based on a build-up of weapons; it must be based, rather, on concerted efforts on their reduction and complete elimination. The balance of terror is now yielding to a meeting of the minds, the hearts and the actions of man. That is why the signing of the United Nations the Development, Convention on the Prohibition of Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, in Paris on 13-15 January 1993, not only helps to strengthen international peace and security but also offers prospects for international cooperation in the area of using the chemicals industry for peaceful purposes. The decision by Russia, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and France to extend their moratorium on nuclear testing until September 1994 proves that the Governments of those nuclear Powers are increasingly interested in measures that will make it possible to use scientific and technical developments exclusively for peaceful purposes. the rest of My country joins the international community in congratulating the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea on the reversal of its decision to withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), for that withdrawal from the Treaty would only have weakened it, given that its strength lies in its universality. The determination shown by Member States to move towards the solution of regional conflicts and the new sense of urgency over new threats to the well-being of the planet create a historic opportunity for us to tackle the economic problems facing all of our countries. this Indeed, forty-eighth session of the General Assembly is taking place against a background of general economic crisis. In the new economic order which is characterized by increased trade between three dominant groups - Western Europe, North America and the Pacific- Asia zone - Africa is virtually left out. The developed North seems to have less and less need of Africas products and Africa for its part no longer has the means to buy the goods and services of the North. What is more, the international community does not seem very anxious to find a better way of dealing with the African countries debt burden. This situation cannot but lead to a slowing down in trade on the world market and directly affect African economies which are already suffering. In these circumstances our survival necessarily requires sustained regional integration so that we can be in a better position to deal with the vicissitudes of the international economic environment and take up the challenge of how to develop our own continent. 46 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session In his \"An Agenda for Peace\" the Secretary-General emphasized the role of regional organizations in establishing peace and preventive diplomacy. This role naturally extends to development too. We cannot overemphasize the importance of integration for development. In the case of Africa such integration is a means of encouraging trade, investment, and research and development cooperation among African countries. That is why the Heads of State or Government of the members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), meeting in Cotonou from 22 to 24 July 1993, adopted and signed a revised Treaty of the Economic Community of West African States and reaffirmed their determination to bring a new dynamism to the process of regional integration. If the development of Africa is primarily the responsibility of the Africans themselves, is no less important for the international community to recognize the principle of shared responsibility and full partnership with Africa. it In this note should connection we the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s is not living up to all the hopes that the African countries placed in it. It is necessary further to strengthen national capacities and to create a climate that is favourable to development. that While Benin welcomes the study on the need and the feasibility of the establishment of a fund to diversify African commodities, we strongly hope that bolder action will be taken with a view to implementing the new programme and ensuring the input of the major financial contributions which are necessary for the establishment of the fund in 1994. Hence we must increase the quality and the quantity of assistance to Africa. In this spirit Benin will in a few days be participating in the Tokyo International Conference on African Development. This Conference, the backdrop of the new world economic and political order of the post-cold-war era, will provide the international community with a new framework for discussing how to reaffirm the question of Africas economic development as one of the major concerns of the world today. to be held against Our hope, widely shared by African countries, is that the Conference, apart from adopting a declaration, will actually lead to specific actions and commitments in support of Africa. The African countries also hope that the Tokyo Declaration of 9 July 1993 of the Group of Seven industrialized countries - which was designed to replace the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Structural Adjustment Programme with another mechanism that would be better adapted to the conditions and realities of developing countries - will soon take effect. If this new mechanism is to have some hope of it will have to be drawn up following succeeding, consultations with actually experiencing the harsh social consequences of the Structural Adjustment Programme. countries that the are If we are to win this wager for development, to which Africa aspires, we have to involve women and children, who represent the majority of the populations of our countries, and so, above all, we have to educate and train young people and adults. In this connection, the Government of the Republic of Benin is actively preparing for the International Year of the Family in 1994. We shall also be participating with great interest in the International Conference on Population and be Development, from 5 to to In addition, we wish to make a real 13 September 1994. contribution to the preparatory work for the World Conference on Women, which will be held in Beijing in 1995. in Cairo held The fact that these various conferences are to be held shows that matters relating to social development are eliciting unprecedented interest in the world. This can also be seen from the decision to convene a World Summit for Social Development in 1995. This renewal of interest is motivated by the profound changes in the social and political situation in the world, and the shifting of priorities at the State level. Democracy cannot become stronger unless there is at least a minimum level of prosperity for peoples. One obstacle to this strengthening of democracy and thus the full development of human rights is poverty, the poverty in which the majority of our populations live. The right to development has been ignored for too long. It must now be regarded as a priority right, a sacred right. Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 47 This right to development is the right to dignity, to personal development, and is not compatible with the subhuman status afflicting millions of human beings, particularly in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. The right to development the gradual elimination of is a human right and a national right, and that is why we welcome the conclusions of the World Conference on Human Rights, which was held in Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993. That Conference certainly marked the beginning of a new era which, we trust, will witness the current in which two thirds of international economic order, mankind cannot meet their basic needs and in which 600 million human beings are living in almost absolute poverty. The elimination of such poverty is one of the basic objectives of Agenda 21. The establishment of an International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, the first of which will be celebrated on 17 October next, is one step in this direction. We can never say often enough that the major ecological problems facing our countries today have a planetary dimension that requires a world-wide approach. This is why the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in Rio in June 1992, made sustainable development one of the major concerns of the international community. That Conference marked a turning-point in the way that we look at our future. It must now be approached in an integrated manner as we work on our development policies. Agenda 21, the basic document that emerged from that Conference, is an enormous programme of action for the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. requires It Governments focused on strategies sustainable development, in close cooperation with the private and public sectors. to adopt national of on Benin welcomes the Commission Here I am happy to draw attention to the major importance my country attaches to follow-up of the decisions and recommendations of Rio. the establishment Sustainable Development, which held its first session here in New York from 14 to 25 June 1993, and we welcome the work of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for the elaboration of an international convention to combat desertification in those anor desertification, particularly in Africa. That Committee has already met, from 24 May to 3 June 1993 in Nairobi and from 13 to 24 September 1993 in Geneva. experiencing serious drought countries Pursuant to the Rio recommendations, on 9 to 13 August 1993 Benin held a national seminar on follow-up strategies to implement the results of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, including consideration of chapter 12 of Agenda 21, on how to combat desertification and the impact of drought. The seminar was held at a time when the international community and the development partners of the third world countries were fully involved in thinking about what strategies should be used to make this concept of sustainable development operational. This seminar was proof of the Government of Benin to abide by the commitments we entered into at Rio. the political will of The Cotonou seminar recommended, the establishment of a national commission on sustainable development. A drafting committee for a national Agenda 21, the major guidelines for which were decided on by the seminar, has been set up. It should finish its work by the end of this year. inter alia, In two years, we shall be celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. The years that have passed since 1945 have been marked by ongoing, fundamental change and by a considerable increase in the membership of the Organization as well as by a significant widening of the Organizations area of activity. It is thus obvious that the Organization needs to be restructured to meet our worlds current requirements. This is why Benin supports the efforts under way to restructure and revitalize the United Nations in its economic and social sectors and related areas. In the view of the delegation of Benin, the reform should be designed to ensure better coordination of the activities of the United Nations and wiser utilization of its human and financial resources. Benin, while still open to dialogue in negotiations, endorses the view of the Group of 77, particularly on the question of how to allocate seats on the governing bodies of bodies such as the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Fund for Population Activities and the United Nations Childrens Fund. In the political area, my country is willing to consider all proposals that take account of the concerns and interests of all the various actors, large and small, in the international political arena at the end of this second millennium. 48 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session Reform of the Security Council is a matter of particular importance to all Member States. Benin will follow closely any proposal strengthen the effectiveness of the Council and avoid transforming it into a forum for sterile debate or logjams or into an instrument that benefits only a privileged few. reform that might for Before I conclude my statement, I should like to recall if we wish to approach the next millennium in that tranquillity, if we wish to draw satisfaction from the efforts made so far along the tortuous and difficult path towards development, we must do everything possible to give more sustained attention to the principle of world-wide partnership and the duty to show solidarity which is necessarily implied by the new international order that now governs the international community. It is Benins wish that mankind, when it draws up its first balance sheet of this new era, should see a drop in the number of ills that continue to undermine the twentieth century, namely poverty, famine, endemic diseases such as malaria, the AIDS pandemic and its devastating human, social and economic consequences, illiteracy, environmental degradation, underdevelopment, and all those other ills that beset us. In an increasingly interdependent world, and faced with this challenge, nations must agree to yield part - only part - of their national sovereignty to our universal human values, and to show greater determination to coexist despite cultural, political, social and economic differences. Only in that way can the world of the twenty-first century be a more hospitable one for people, wherever they may live and whoever they may be. The PRESIDENT: We have heard the last speaker in the general debate for this meeting. I shall now call on those representatives who wish to speak in exercise of the right of reply. I remind members that statements in the exercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and five minutes for the second intervention, and should be made by delegations from their seats. Mr. ANSARI (India): I wish, under rule 73 of the rules of procedure, to refer to the statement made earlier today by the representative of Pakistan. All the water in the East River cannot wash off the stains of falsehood, prejudice and perversion with which the Foreign Minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan defaced this lofty forum. His eloquence is matched only by his sophistry, and the two together constitute an impressive exercise in high-pitched salesmanship of a product whose shelf-life is ending, if it has not ended. The representative of Pakistan sought to assume an air of injured innocence. He would have us believe that he has been forced into combat without even a sword in his hand. The truth, however, is that he does not stand in need of a sword. He is instead making use of every weapon available in the arsenal of modern-day terrorism. His Governments role in recruiting, training, funding and arming terrorists and abetting their infiltration into the Indian states of Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir is well known to Governments, the international media and human rights organizations. Very recently a report by Asia Watch gave ample facts and figures to substantiate what it called \"the Pakistan conduit\" being used by these terrorists. The \"conduit\" is not for moral support, as is claimed so innocently by Pakistan. It is instead a well established channel for injecting deadly hardware into the territory of India. Clinching evidence of this was provided by the United States Department of State report on global terrorism for the year 1991, and by a Department of State spokesman on 8 January 1993. Matters have deteriorated to such an extent that the United States Government considered in all seriousness declaring Pakistan a State sponsor of terrorism. This is evident from an extract from a letter dated 2 August 1993 which the State Department wrote to the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the United States House of Representatives, which reads as follows: \"If there is any subsequent resurgence of official support for those who commit terrorist acts against India, either directly or through private groups, the Secretary of State will not hesitate to name Pakistan a State sponsor of terrorism. \"... \"In any case, the Secretary of State will review this issue again not later than December this year\". Pakistans commitment this terrorism is \"sustainable\". to the cause of promoting terrorism does not stop at this. It has gone further, to ensure that It has done so by establishing a deep nexus between terrorism and the trade in narcotic drugs. The present caretaker Government of Pakistan published only the other day a list of some of their more prominent narcotics barons. It reads like a \"Whos Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 49 If further evidence is needed of Who\" of that noble land. the Pakistani hand, it is readily available in countries such as Egypt, Tunisia and Algeria, where Pakistani-trained terrorists of the Peshawar school have been wreaking havoc. It would thus seem that the crocodile tears the Foreign Minister of Pakistan has shed before this Assembly are really in support of his extraordinary plea that world opinion should accept Pakistans actions as the principal promoter of narco-terrorism in the world. From this unacceptable premise the Government of Pakistan wishes to argue that it should not only be allowed a free hand to violate with impunity the basic human rights of ordinary citizens, of men, women and children, but should also be proclaimed the protector of the human rights of the very terrorists who are violating every norm of civilized existence. The verdict of the jury on this strange plea is clear and unambiguous. It is incorporated into paragraph 17 of the Vienna Declaration adopted after the World Conference on Human Rights in June this year. The words of that paragraph are worth recalling: \"The acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations as well as linkage in some countries to drug trafficking are activities aimed at the destruction of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy, threatening territorial integrity, security of States constituted Governments. The international community should take the necessary steps to enhance cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism.\" (CONF.1, para. 17) destabilizing legitimately and they cloak a nefarious design aimed at The Foreign Minister of Pakistan also sought to regale us today by replaying an old, worn-out gramophone record on the question of self-determination. It would be charitable In reality, to characterize his remarks as half-truths. however, the territorial integrity of India. He conveniently ignores the fact that the debate on the concept of self-determination was settled in the United Nations long ago. The concept itself relates to people under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation. It specifically does not permit action which would dismember or impair, totally or in part, the territorial integrity or political unity of States. This is spelled out conclusively and unambiguously in paragraph 2 of the Vienna Declaration I cited earlier. The state of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India. The validity of its accession to India, both legally and through the popular will, is uncontestable. Rather, it is Pakistan that is the aggressor and is to this day in unlawful occupation of a part of Jammu and Kashmir. The only issue that remains to be resolved, therefore, is the vacation by Pakistan of that aggression. It is a matter of history that in the past 46 years Pakistan has committed aggression against India on three different occasions. After each setback it committed itself to solemn agreements, multilaterally or bilaterally. The commitments undertaken therein were forsaken soon thereafter. The excuse in each case was a yearning for something not legally Pakistans, the justification always pegged to a nebulous principle that it never practised in regard to its own people in any part of its own territory. spoke of The Foreign Minister the sanctity of international agreements; he chose not to mention the Simla Agreement signed between our two countries in 1972, which has provided the framework for the conduct of bilateral relations. In that agreement, both countries undertook not to interfere in each others internal affairs, to prevent hostile propaganda, and also to prevent the organization, assistance or encouragement of any acts detrimental to the maintenance of peace and harmonious relations. Both countries further undertook to resolve their differences by peaceful means, through bilateral negotiations. Instead of these provisions, implementing the Government of Pakistan decided, around the year 1984, to conduct a proxy war against my country through the organization of large-scale terrorism in the border states of Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. A report published on 1 February 1993 by the Republican Research Committee of the United States House of Representatives traces in graphic detail in which the Pakistan Government agencies have involved themselves in the training of terrorists and their infiltration into India. the manner India is thus the principal victim of these criminals; however, it is not the only one. A report in The New York Times on 11 August 1993 by its correspondent in Peshawar attributes to the concerned officials of the United States the view that \"some of the men, and much of the inspiration, for the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York in February and for a second bombing conspiracy ... in New York in June\" (\"Where Arab Militants Train and Wait\", The New York Times, 11 August 1993, p. A8) came from Peshawar. The global dimensions of the matter are thus evident. 50 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session This, then, is the record. It speaks for itself. The conclusion is inescapable that such an approach to relations with a neighbouring country is contrary to norms of civilized behaviour, self-defeating and certainly not conducive to common well-being. take into account India, on its part, wishes well to Pakistan and its people. Our two peoples are linked by ties of blood, history and culture and must the economic imperatives of a common region. The people and the Government of India extend once again the hand of friendship to the people and Government of Pakistan, in the expectation that they will see fit to make a new beginning and give shape to the vision of a great Indian poet, Mohammad Iqbal, whom Pakistan regards as its national poet. I translate the couplet, \"Come, let us lift the veil of otherness, bring together estranged ones, Erase the signs of strangeness\". Mr. AKRAM (Pakistan): Let me respond to this spewing of hatred which we have just heard from the distinguished representative of India. Not only has he robbed the people of Kashmir of their land, now he also wishes to rob Pakistan of its national poet. Jammu and Kashmir is not an integral part of India. Security Council resolution 47 (1948), notes the desire of India and Pakistan that \"the question of the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India or Pakistan should be decided through the democratic method of a free and impartial plebiscite\" (fourth preambular paragraph). This call for a plebiscite was reiterated in Security Council resolutions 91 (1951) and 122 (1957), among others, and resolutions of the United Nations Commission on India and Pakistan, specifically its resolutions of 13 August 1948 and 5 January 1949. India has refused to implement these resolutions. The United Nations maps - the official documents of the United Nations - all indicate that Jammu and Kashmir is disputed territory. Kashmir is on the agenda of the Security Council. The Secretary-Generals latest report mentions Jammu and Kashmir as a question that has to be resolved between India and Pakistan. The oldest United Nations peace-keeping operation, the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), has been stationed on the line of control in Jammu and Kashmir since 1949. So much for Kashmir being an integral part of India. The Simla Agreement did not change the status of Kashmir. The Simla Agreement called for a final settlement of Jammu and Kashmir through bilateral negotiations or any other means agreed between the parties. Pakistan has sought to pursue bilateral negotiations with India. We wrote to the Prime Minister of India in 1992 at the level of our Prime Minister. The response was to shut the door in our face. India has in bilateral negotiations. refused to discuss Kashmir Territorial The distinguished representative of India has said that the self-determination in Kashmir would erode the territorial integrity of India. integrity applies only to territory that is part of States, not to territories which are disputed, territories whose status has not been determined. India has been in colonial occupation of Kashmir since 1947. It deserves to be treated as a colonial Power. A people struggling against colonial occupation for their right to self- determination is entitled to struggle by all means possible. India has attempted to tarnish the Kashmiri struggle by depicting it as terrorism. Pakistan condemns terrorism. Terrorism implies senseless violence against innocent people. But when a people is subjected to foreign occupation, when its homes are invaded, its sons are shot and its women are raped, does it not have the right to take up arms in self-defence? As one Kashmiri businessman is quoted by The Los Angeles Times of 29 August, \"Now it is a question of survival. Now they go into our homes and shoot our children. I am a grandfather, and sometimes I feel I must pick up a gun.\" ... If the Kashmiris are terrorists, then so were all those brave sons and daughters who struggled against colonialism by all means at their disposal and won freedom for the vast majority of the States represented in this Hall tonight. If the Kashmiris are terrorists, then most of the States represented here are the products of terrorism. The recent human-rights Conference in Vienna took special note of the particular situation of peoples under colonial and other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation, and recognized their right to take any legitimate action, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, to realize their to self-determination. Indias campaign in Kashmir constitutes State terrorism. The Non-Aligned Summit in Jakarta described the inalienable right Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 51 suppression of a peoples struggle for self-determination as the worst form of terrorism, and what it means to the Kashmiris is torture. I quote a report of the International Federation of Lawyers for Human Rights: stop the widespread practice of rape by Indian security forces. Arson has been a weapon in Indias counter- insurgency strategy in Kashmir since 1990. \"People, mainly young men, are tortured in Kashmir every day. ... there is exhaustive evidence gathered by the local human-rights workers, lawyers and doctors to support this assertion ... The methods employed are barbaric, inhuman and unimaginably vicious. Detainees are beaten with rods or lathis; they are whipped with flexible cable; they are subjected to electric shock treatment ...\". I shall not go any further; it is too beastly to be recounted in this forum. Amnesty International: \"Torture is practised systematically in Jammu and Kashmir.\" Rape: this afternoon we referred to Kunan Poshpora. On 10 October 1992 the village of Chak Saidapara was the site of another mass rape by the Indian army. The Asia Watch report says that as the conflict in Kashmir enters its fourth year, central and state authorities have done little to Massacre: Batekote, 1 October 1992. Nasrullahpora, 13 July 1992. The list is endless. Sopura, 6 January 1993. The representative of India has chosen to speak of Pakistan in terms that have been borrowed from a lexicon that one should not use against ones neighbour. Let me remind him that in Pakistan we have a functioning democracy. No part of Pakistan is under emergency rule, like Kashmir. Unlike India, we do not have pogroms in Pakistan. One hundred thousand Muslims have perished in acts of religious frenzy and communal violence in India since 1947. In Pakistan we not only profess democracy, we also practice it. We do not, like India, pretend to be perfect. But we are certainly better than India, a country which is fast emerging as the sick man of Asia, riven by internal dissensions, divided into castes, classes and nationalities, surging with irrational and murderous forces of Hindu fundamentalism, ruled by indecision and ambiguity, prone to bullying its neighbours and with a proclivity to the use of force; a country which has engaged in 17 different wars since its independence, the highest number for any State represented in this Hall. The PRESIDENT: May I remind members that statements in exercise of the right of reply are limited to five minutes for the second intervention. I now call on the representative of India. Mr. ANSARI (India): We are constrained to speak a second time. The representative of Pakistan has added nothing either to the knowledge or to the perception of this Assembly. His remarks call to mind another couplet of the poet Iqbal, who, incidentally, was born an Indian and died an Indian: \"He participates not in serious quest, but opts eagerly for blind emulation\". My delegation considers it unnecessary to add to this very apt description"}}
