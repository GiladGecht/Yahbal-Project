{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of the delegation of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, I should like, first of all, to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly for the current session. It is our hope that your efforts will crown the session with success. to build a new, The common task facing the international community today is independent, peaceful and prosperous world. Our planets people have an identical aspiration: to build a new and independent world, free from all forms of domination and subjugation, aggression and war. All countries and nations should have unrestricted freedom to choose and develop their own political, economic and social systems on the basis of their sovereign rights, including the right to self-determination. Independence is the life and soul of each country and nation, and the common right of mankind. A steadfast commitment to independence enables each country to safeguard its national dignity and rights, to maintain and consolidate international relationships on a sound basis, to bring about genuine democratization of international society and, furthermore, to help to accelerate the creation of an independent world. The absence of independence will lead to failure to safeguard national sovereignty and dignity or to secure a countrys prosperity and well-being. It is an ineluctable fact that where independence is violated, there will be domination, subordination, subjugation 12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session National reunification is a cause to realize the independence of our nation, while the principle of national independence is the inalienable fundamental principle of reunification. Great national unity is part and parcel of the process of the independent and peaceful reunification of the country. Great national unity is a fundamental prerequisite to, and an essential factor in, the countrys independent and peaceful reunification. Therefore the Government of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea has consistently subordinated everything to the goal of national reunification through great national unity incorporating the principle of national independence. The whole history of the efforts for national reunification and in particular the prevailing situation teach us that the Korean people should move towards greater national unity of the whole nation based on the principle of independence in order to attain the countrys reunification. Of course, there still exist differences in ideologies, ideals and political systems within the nation, but these differences could be overcome without much difficulty, since our nation has its own intrinsic common identity that has been shaped and consolidated through the time-honoured history of 5,000 years. Our nation remains closely knit together by kinship as a homogeneous people, a unique entity in the world, and the whole nation, whether in the north, in the south, or abroad, is united by the common desire for national reunification. Members of the Korean nation should not be viewed differently based on whether they live in the north, south or abroad, nor should distance be put between Korean nationals just in order to curry favour with foreign forces. We can no longer engage in antagonism and confrontation at the sacrifice of our great cause. that the Agreement The inter-Korean dialogue has made such epoch-making progress on Reconciliation, Non-Aggression, and Cooperation and Exchanges and the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula were adopted and effectuated in our country. This is intended to serve our nations effort to end the antagonism and confrontation and promote reconciliation and unity and break down the wall of division to pave the way for reunification. Our nation is unanimous in its desire and aspiration to achieve unity, transcending all differences, and to make a tangible contribution to the countrys reunification and the prosperity of the reunified country. authored and The respected leader Comrade Kim Il Sung, President the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, has of \"Ten-Point personally Programme of Great Unity of the Whole Nation for Reunification of the Country\" reflecting the desire and will of our nation to terminate the history of division and confrontation and reunify the country. published the This historic programme provides clarification on how to establish a confederal State through the application of the three principles of independence, peace and great national unity, without any bias against either the north or south, on the basis of coexistence and the equal representation of the two regional governments. The confederal State would be independent, peaceful, non-aligned and neutral, maintaining a balanced posture towards the major Powers. It also envisions the protection of private or corporate capital and assets, and joint stock interests with foreign capital before and after reunification. The Ten-Point Programme of Great Unity of the Whole Nation for Reunification of the Country, which aims to bring about the countrys reunification on the principle of the spirit of national independence, is a charter of national unity and reunification which reflects most comprehensively the will and the aspirations of the Korean nation and takes into full consideration the current international situation. It calls not only on the supporters of reunification but also on those who have feared or remained onlookers to reunification to take a stand for the cause of national unity and reunification. The programme also opens up positive prospects for achieving the historical cause of the countrys reunification within the 1990s. Although obstacles and difficulties still stand in the way of reunification, the entire Korean people will definitely achieve national reunification in great unity, by displaying patriotism and the spirit of national independence. At present, the relaxation of tension and establishment of peace on the Korean peninsula presents itself as an urgent issue, the solution of which allows for no further delay. With a view to easing tension and achieving a durable the Korean Armistice peace on the Korean peninsula, Agreement should, inter alia, be replaced with a peace agreement. In reality, the Korean Armistice Agreement has already become outdated and the armistice mechanism remains in fact paralysed. The continuance in place of the out-of-date armistice arrangements is primarily responsible for a series of complicated and sensitive issues, including the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula - issues still remaining to be resolved. Forty-eighth session - 5 October l993 13 The fact that the state of cease-fire and the armistice arrangements of the 1950s remain unchanged even after 40 years is in itself abnormal. It is thanks to the peace-loving policy and the will of the Government of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea that peace and security have been maintained so far on the Korean peninsula. Only the replacement of the Korean Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement will lead to a full and satisfactory resolution of all the issues, including the nuclear issue, will remove hostility in inter-Korean relations and will work in favour of peace in Korea and its peaceful reunification. Such being the case, if the United Nations continues losing sight of the fundamental issues related to peace on the Korean peninsula and instead preoccupies itself with non- essential issues, it will only throw obstacles in the way of a solution of the Korean question. The United Nations should direct its primary attention to the replacement of the Korean Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement, and play its due role in terminating the armistice system and establishing a new peace arrangement. New York last June the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea and the United States of America issued a joint statement containing their policy commitments related to a fundamental resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The joint statement clarifies, in unambiguous terms, principles of assurances against the threat and use of force including nuclear weapons; peace and security in a nuclear-free Korean impartial application of full-scope safeguards, mutual respect for each others sovereignty, and non-interference in each others internal affairs; and support for the peaceful reunification of Korea. peninsula, including At the second round of talks in Geneva, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea delegation put forward a proposal on replacing its existing graphite-moderated reactors and associated nuclear facilities with light-water moderated reactors, thus demonstrating with more clarity the transparency and integrity of its non-nuclear policy. We believe this is the right time for the United Nations to make an innovative decision to dissolve the United Nations Forces Command in south Korea and to replace the Korean Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement in accordance with resolution 3390 (XXX) B adopted by the thirtieth session of the United Nations General Assembly. In this connection we maintain that negotiations among the parties concerned should begin at the earliest possible time to work out a new peace arrangement that will replace the present armistice system. The denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is another essential factor in building a durable peace and security there. If all the commitments the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea and the United States of America have agreed upon are translated into practice - including assurances against the threat and use of force, including nuclear weapons, and the peaceful use of nuclear energy through light-water moderated reactors, plus the negative security assurances - then the prospects will open up for a fundamental and final resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and the basis for the improvement of Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea - United States of America relations will be laid down. Furthermore, epoch-making progress will be made in reducing tensions on the Korean peninsula and in ensuring peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world. The Government of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea remains committed to its consistent position of turning the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free, peace zone. As we have made clear more than once, we have no nuclear weapons; we have neither the intention nor the need to develop these weapons, nor the financial resources to support their production. We would not object to inspection of our nuclear facilities, but only when impartiality is fully guaranteed. As shown by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea-United States of America talks, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is a political issue to be resolved between the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea and the United States of America. It is to be recalled that here in Initial and meaningful progress in the efforts to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is the outcome of the negotiations by the responsible parties. This vividly proves that the only way to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula lies in dialogue and negotiations. However, we regret to note that a certain amount of pressure has been renewed by those forces that still remain obsessed with an outdated way of thinking at the time when the talks between the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea and the United States of America aimed at resolving the nuclear issue are under way and consultations between our country and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have been conducted. 14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session the thirty-seventh session of The so-called resolution on our \"nuclear issue\" was adopted at the General Conference of the IAEA, which was held some time ago. This act cannot but be viewed as the product of political conspiracy to impede, by all means, the solution of nuclear issues through negotiations and to stifle our Republic. The peace-loving position of the Government of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea to turn the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free peace zone remains unchanged, and we shall continue our sincere efforts in the future, too, to remove the nuclear threat fundamentally and resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. We regard the adoption of the \"resolution\" itself at the General Conference of the IAEA as a wanton violation of our Republics sovereignty and part of sinister political offensive aimed at forcing international pressure upon us. The whole process of the General Conference of the IAEA held recently has eloquently shown that the measures taken in the past by the secretariat and Board of Governors were unjustifiable, and, accordingly, the agency has lost face and integrity in the process of solving the \"nuclear issue\". its political character or The \"nuclear issue\" of the Korean peninsula can be resolved only through talks between the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea and the United States of America, either in the light of its origin. Accordingly, two rounds of such talks have been held so far, which is well known to the world. This notwithstanding, it is absurd that the Japanese Prime Minister and the South Korean Foreign Minister picked a quarrel with us in this august Assembly a few days ago, clamouring about \"implementing the safeguards agreement\" and \"international concern about development of nuclear weapons\". Japan should not mention the fictitious \"development of nuclear weapons\", but should give up its attempt to become a military Power and to realize its aim of nuclear armament, which it is accelerating under this pretext. The south Korean authorities should discontinue nuclear-war exercises with foreign forces against fellow countrymen and should not pursue so-called international mutual assistance systems either. Our country, as a member of international society, will implement its commitment to the just and early solution of the nuclear issue. I hope that all the States Members of the United Nations will lend encouragement to the Democratic Peoples Republic of Koreas position in favour of a negotiated resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and fully cooperate in taking practical measures to help implement the points agreed upon at the talks between the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea and the United States of America. Today the world situation and international relations call for an early liquidation of the legacies of the cold-war era that have been negated by history and the prevention of all sorts of attempts to reverse the forward movement of history. Universal disarmament and the abolition world wide of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction are most urgent in eliminating the residue of the cold-war era and attaining peace and security in the world. Everything that threatens the survival of mankind and the devastation of societys treasures should be abolished. The recent moratorium on nuclear testing introduced by certain nuclear-weapon States can be called a step forward, in the light of the fact that nuclear testing itself is the most dangerous nuclear arms race among the nuclear Powers and a major source of nuclear proliferation. It is our view that, along with the permanent ban on nuclear testing, epoch-- making steps should be taken to destroy a colossal number of the nuclear weapons accumulated on the globe and all sorts of nuclear weapons deployed in other countries. In particular, nuclear weapons deployed on the Korean peninsula and its surrounding regions should be dismantled. Without this solution, any talk about international nuclear non-proliferation and world-wide nuclear disarmament is senseless. the cold war has collapsed, The existence of military blocs and the presence of foreign military bases and troops in other countries are the products of cold-war policy and are permanent factors threatening world peace and security. Now that the old structure of there is no justification whatsoever for the existence of the military blocs and their means for waging wars of aggression. The military blocs established under the pretext of the so-called balance of forces during the cold-war era should be dissolved. Furthermore, the presence of foreign military bases and troops in other countries is a violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of those nations. This runs counter to the trend towards independence of the present era. We demand the closing of all foreign military bases in various parts of the world and the unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops therefrom. Forty-eighth session - 5 October l993 15 The peaceful settlement of disputes between countries and nations is one of the important issues in safeguarding world peace and security at present. In different parts of the world we are now witnessing the trampling underfoot of national sovereignty and the escalation of regional, religious and ethnic disputes into full-fledged wars. This has been disturbing peace and security in some regions, and some countries are suffering from severe disasters. Disputes between countries should be resolved through negotiations between the parties concerned in order to meet their mutual interests and serve the cause of world peace. it remains the same, As long as the structure of the existing inequitable international economic order is impossible to eliminate the ever-widening gap between rich and poor, between the developed and the developing countries and save the developing nations from poverty, disease and disasters. The developed countries must accept responsibility for this and refrain from any actions detrimental to the economic development of the developing countries. This was specifically highlighted in the resolution and recommendations adopted by the Tenth Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Countries. Constructive measures should be taken to resume dialogue between the developed and developing countries, reform the inequitable international economic order and establish a new, equitable international economic order. Along with this, the developing countries should adopt practical measures to realize South-South cooperation, starting from such priority fields as food, agriculture, public health and so on, in an effort to overcome their economic poverty and establish a South-South economic order. The historic tasks and responsibilities the United Nations has assumed before mankind are growing heavier with each passing day, and the world watches the role of the United Nations and its activities. The United Nations should be democratized to meet the requirements of the present situation and the aspirations of its Member States, according to the principles of independence, equality and impartiality. The important point here is that all Member States should be left to fully exercise their sovereignty, regardless of differences in size of population or territory, whether strong or weak, rich or poor. All countries and nations are equal members in international society and are entitled to equal rights. Mr. El-Araby (Egypt), Vice-President, took the chair. In the world there are big and small countries, but there cannot be senior or junior countries; there are developed and less developed nations, but there cannot be dominating nations and nations destined to be dominated by others. We stand against any privileges being given to any particular nation in international relations. We call for universal adherence to the principles of mutual respect and non-interference in the internal affairs of others, for equality and mutual benefits, and for friendship and cooperation among all the countries to be based on these principles. In the international arena today, some forces are resorting to anachronistic actions; in violation of impartiality and international justice, these forces connive at actions on the part of certain countries that violate international norms on a number of issues, including the nuclear issue, the human rights situation and terrorism, while pretending to be ignorant of them. At the same time, they accuse those countries that disobey them of a \"nuclear threat\", of \"human rights violations\" and of \"State-sponsored terrorism\", imposing unacceptable pressure on them. Unjustifiable and unreasonable actions by a few countries that resort to strong-arm tactics and high-handed behaviour while interfering in the internal affairs of others and applying a double standard to the practice of international relations must no longer be tolerated. The United Nations should undergo restructuring and improvement. Such important measures are needed to meet more effectively the changed reality and new challenges. Primary attention should be paid to reviewing and readjusting the composition of the permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council. As the non-aligned and other developing countries form a majority of the United Nations membership, they should exercise their voice on an equivalent basis and should not be denied the opportunity to take part in the process of resolving major international issues. We hold that the third world countries should, as a matter of course, be included in the permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council, in proportion to the numbers of their members in the Organization. At present, Japan is launching a public relations campaign to gain a seat as a permanent member of the Security Council. But Japan is not assuming its due responsibility for the acts of aggression and war crimes committed during the Second World War and has so far failed to make a clean slate of its past. Therefore, it is not 16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session reasonable to talk about membership. its qualification for permanent Only when the United Nations measures up to its own responsibilities and role on an unprejudiced basis can it take its rightful place as the international Organization that serves international justice and champions world peace; only then will it be able to meet the expectations of its Member States. The destiny of each country and nation is closely interlinked with the common destiny of mankind. The worlds people advocating independence should work together in unity to consolidate their respective national independence, independent development, and to contribute actively to a stronger world peace and security. their countries to further We fully support the Cambodian people in their efforts to promote national reconciliation, unity and rehabilitation, as we do the peoples of the Association of South-East Asian Nations in their endeavours to establish a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia, and we support other Asian people in their struggle to build a new, independent, peaceful and prosperous Asia. the member States of including the Palestinian question; We would like to express our firm solidarity with the Palestinian and all the other Arab peoples who are engaged in efforts towards a fair and lasting solution of the Middle East question, to the entire African people in their struggle to overcome socio-economic difficulties and achieve the independent development of their countries; to the Cuban people in their struggle to defend the countrys sovereignty and dignity and the gains of socialism; and to the Latin American peoples in their efforts towards peace and prosperity. The Government of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea and the Korean people will offer active support and firm solidarity to the people of all countries throughout the world who are struggling to oppose all sorts of domination and subjugation, to build a new society and to promote the common cause of mankind. The Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea is guided by its consistent independence, peace and friendship in international relations, and these ideals coincide with the ideals of international society. ideals of The Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea will continue to hold fast to independence, to further strengthen contacts and cooperation with United Nations Member States, and to remain faithful to the common cause of mankind for global independence. The delegation of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea wishes, in conclusion, to express its hope that at its current session the General Assembly will have a successful discussion of all the agenda items placed before it at this session the representatives of the various countries, thus contributing to building a new, free and peaceful world. concerted through efforts the of all (interpretation Mr. PAREDES (Ecuador) from Spanish): I am pleased to convey my congratulations to Ambassador Samuel Insanally, the Permanent Representative of Guyana and a distinguished member of our Latin American and Caribbean Group, on his well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly. A short while ago, we were hailing the end of the cold war. There seemed to be a fresh possibility of building a new international order based on sound moral principles, namely the principles of freedom and democracy. justice, law, The Gulf crisis, caused by Iraqs invasion of Kuwait, offered the international community an opportunity to react resolutely to restore the rights thus violated. The principles of condemnation of the use or the threat of the use of force as a means of settling disputes were underscored. The inadmissibility and illegitimacy of the acquisition of territories through force were reaffirmed. The principles of the peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States were strengthened. Ecuador was gratified to see the resultant reinforcement of the fundamental and age-old pillars of its international policy. The world today aspires more firmly and decisively to live in freedom and democracy and in an atmosphere of full respect for human rights. This fundamental change has allowed the spread, not only of positive forces, but also of underlying conflicts which, within various regions, have set off apparently uncontainable escalation. The United Nations, whose prestige had reached new heights, was facing increasingly numerous, pressing and complex problems. Extreme nationalism had flared up in the Forty-eighth session - 5 October l993 17 Balkans and elsewhere, while the breakdown of authority had given rise to tragic humanitarian situations in Somalia and in other regions. In Cambodia, the Organization had to contribute to rebuilding the State. The problems have not disappeared; on the contrary, they proliferate in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and in the former Soviet Union. The large numbers of refugees created by war serve as a pretext for extremist, nationalist and xenophobic ideologies to arise in the very heart of Europe. The world, which applauded United Nations action on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, is examining with a critical eye the Organizations inaction and ineffectiveness in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Bonn, the graffiti read, \"Europe is dying in Sarajevo\". In the Iraq-Kuwait conflict, the use of force and the acquisition of territory by force was condemned, but it seems that in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina the use of force is being allowed to yield results and to expand the territory of the aggressor. Here is a clear illustration that international morality is opposed to double standards of action. In that context, Ecuador views as vital the work under way to restructure and strengthen the world Organization. The General Assembly must shoulder with greater authority its responsibilities as the most representative democratic organ of the United Nations. The Security Council needs to be restructured to reflect the striking changes in the membership of the United Nations and to ensure that it is more representative and, hence, more legitimate. We commend all the steps being taken to that end, and we support others that still need to be taken to ensure that the is characterized by vision and work of its membership should be transparency. We think that its work will be expanded, within limits ensuring that effective the Organization. Democratizing participation in the Councils work requires the presence of States of special significance on the international scene, such as Germany and Japan, and of representatives of other geographical areas not now properly represented. the democratization of and aimed at the Council General Assembly has requested of the Secretary-General, on an agenda for development. Ecuador was pleased by the results of the recent World Conference on Human Rights. We believe that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action constitute an important step forward towards recognizing the universal nature of human rights. is universal and inalienable. Ecuador appeals to all States to make an effort to implement the goals and purposes of the Vienna Programme of Action. to development The right is deeply by Ecuador gratified positive developments in South Africa. We hope that the elections scheduled for 1994 will mark the conclusive establishment of a democratic, non-racial, pluralistic society truly free and open to progress. the For that reason, Ecuador The most important element of progress may well be social development. firmly supported the initiative to convene the World Summit for Social Development. We reiterate our backing for the international communitys decision, which will add meaning to the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. The world economy is at a difficult stage. Even the developed economies are in deep crisis. We must adopt a new monetary and fiscal policy aimed at promoting short- term recovery and at eliminating structural imbalances in the medium term. It is vital to coordinate the macro-economic policies of the strongest countries in order to promote world economic growth. It is necessary also to take account of the legitimate interests of all countries, especially developing countries. It will be impossible to maintain and bolster our democracies without at the same time engaging in economic and social programmes aimed at improved living standards for all. In addressing these issues we should not rely solely on old economic statistical systems, but should turn to systems that evaluate the quality of life, such as that proposed by the United Nations Development Programme. The work of the United Nations in the economic and fields should be strengthened and made more social effective. We must not forget that peace is threatened not only by military aggression but also, and even more, by situations of injustice or crisis that ought to be settled in a spirit of international solidarity. For that reason, Ecuador looks forward to seeing as soon as possible the report the I would recall that a countrys domestic policies play a dominant part in its development process. Ecuador has decided to carry out serious and thorough structural reforms that will permit greater scope for private enterprise and individual reduce Government intervention wherever it has proved to be ineffective and inappropriate. initiative and that will 18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session Economic development is meaningful when it addresses human reality. To achieve this, we must be firmly committed to modernizing the State and, by our example, ensuring that morality prevails the Government. in the work of But national efforts to modernize the State and open the economy to the universal trend towards freedom require timely, adequate financial support. This should be obtained, basically, by establishing a trading system making possible fair prices for commodities and other exports of developing countries. Ironically, while they make splendid speeches in favour of free trade, the powerful countries continue to impose measures that contradict their fine words. One example is the import barriers on Latin American bananas imposed by the European Economic Community. We are concerned about what results will issue from the Uruguay Round of negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). We need transparent machinery to fight protectionism; this must result from true international negotiations. For many countries, certainly including Ecuador, the external debt continues to be one of the most serious problems and one that has the heaviest negative impact, not only in the economic but also in the social and even political fields. We must review the financial policies of the international credit agencies and complement their resources with direct private investment, so that the flow of capital from the developing world to the developed countries does not, as has happened to date, exceed the amount of aid or investment channelled to the developing countries. Prudent and appropriate regulation of the environment and development is a task that concerns and interests us all. We must promote sustainable development that will meet humanitys needs today without jeopardizing the rights of future generations. The Rio Conference is of far-reaching importance and the fulfilment of the decisions and commitments undertaken there is crucial. Agenda 21 is a historic document requiring political resolve on the part of all the establishment and consolidation of financial sources is essential. In that regard, into effect. if it is to be put In the context of international security it is vitally important that all international agreements concluded within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency be strictly complied with, and that the inspection systems be strengthened to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In this respect, we support all efforts to create new nuclear-weapon-free zones and we voice our concern at any failure to comply with the resolutions relating to the Korean peninsula. We urge the Government of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea to heed the just demands of the international community. Today, I have heard with great concern of a possible breach of the moratorium on nuclear testing by the Peoples Republic of China. If that information is confirmed, it will represent a grave step backwards in the process of establishing moratoriums on nuclear testing. We hope that it will not trigger a rush to new testing on the part of other nuclear Powers. In Latin America, democracy and freedom have been strengthened. It is our hope that, by means of the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination, Latin American will soon be free of the remaining exceptions. The case of Haiti is particularly disquieting. Respect for democracy and human values is a basic pillar of civilized coexistence. Ecuador believes that the joint action of the international community must encourage a new phase that will provide the Haitian people with certain basic guarantees. Throughout its history, Ecuador has demonstrated its peaceful spirit in true and unquestionable terms. In that spirit, it participated in the United Nations Observer Group in Central America and the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador. It continues to support the latter and has offered its forces for other peace-keeping operations. The proliferation of peace-keeping operations has highlighted the need to carry out a careful review of the conditions in which these operations are created and carried out and the limits of their respective mandates. This Organization should set the example of austerity in fund management in order to enhance its moral authority and its effectiveness. In the light of its special links with Latin America, Ecuador attaches particular importance to its relations with neighbouring countries. Our Government has strengthened and expanded its traditional relations with Colombia, and they have recently been evolving with great promise. A similar process is under way between the Governments of Ecuador and Peru. The Presidents of Ecuador and Peru have given repeated and eloquent proof of their political resolve to make progress in the process of dialogue that has opened between the two countries. This Forty-eighth session - 5 October l993 19 process will enable us to ensure a climate of friendship, trust and understanding and to narrow the differences in our positions on the territorial issue. Together we can make significant steps towards promoting the well-being of our peoples, and as we move towards understanding we will be able to overcome the differences which have long been an obstacle in the way of a new era of fruitful coexistence. The Government of Ecuador was pleased and very grateful to note the demonstrations of support from many countries, particularly American ones, for our dialogue with Peru. We also appreciated the message that His Holiness Pope John Paul II addressed to President Sixto Duran Ballen and President Alberto Fujimori on the occasion of their meeting in Bahia de Caraques in December 1992. Ecuador, by tradition and inclination, has been a peace- loving nation and believes that the only valid way to overcome the territorial differences persisting between it and Peru lies in the peaceful settlement of disputes. One option in that regard is the arbitration of His Holiness the Pope, who, with his lofty moral authority and his enduring devotion to understanding and harmony among peoples, is extremely well qualified. That is why the Constitutional President of Ecuador, Sixto Duran Ballen, speaking from this very rostrum at the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly, reiterated the initiative which former Ecuadorian President Rodrigo Borja set forth at the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly concerning the arbitration of the Holy See. In response to this initiative and in keeping with the spirit of dialogue that has been maintained and cultivated between the two countries, the President of Peru proposed the participation of the Holy See through the mediation of an expert adviser who would offer his opinion from the point of view of that neighbouring and friendly country with respect to the \"frontier disputes\" with Ecuador. We now have two proposals that are distinct in scope and content: on the one hand, arbitration, and on the other the assistance of an expert adviser. But they coincide in their recognition of the great help to be had from the Pontiff, who in the course of history has traditionally worked for rapprochement and understanding among peoples. These very differences and varied proposals highlight the need to preserve and strengthen the process of dialogue between the two countries. Ecuador is faithfully committed to that process with a view not only to finding the fairest, most realistic and honourable solution to the problem, but also in order to respond appropriately to all the possibilities for complementary action, cooperation and joint endeavour that these two countries could and should pursue with a view to securing the development, integration and well-being for their peoples. Thus, we shall no longer be divided by borders and borders will become points of union and of promising cooperation, with tremendous scope and possibilities. This has been the case with regard to the maritime area that we share; this is the hope of the two peoples, especially the peoples of southern Ecuador and northern Peru; this must be the case with regard to the Amazon River meeting for a historic reconciliation of our two nations that adequately meets the major interests of the two countries in the Amazon region and identifies them in plans that take account of their individual and collective rights, enhance their potential and create conditions reflecting the importance of a major river system and a region that all the countries of the basin must preserve and promote for the sake of current development as well as the future well-being of our peoples. In this spirit of frank and constructive dialogue, President Sixto Duran Ballen accepted the kind invitation of President Alberto Fujimori to visit Peru. Ecuadors Foreign Ministry is busy making preparations with the authorities of that friendly country for this mission so that the greatest possible success may be achieved. A few days ago the world enthusiastically welcomed the handshake between two courageous men who had opted for peace and understanding. I should like, on behalf of Ecuador, to pay tribute to Prime Minister Itzhak Rabin and President Yasser Arafat. I am confident that this gesture, this historic event, will be not only the beginning of a tough but promising relationship aimed at securing understanding and cooperation between the two peoples but also a signal, a sign of the times, for many other peoples who have to pursue the arduous path of peace and understanding. For this reason, President Clinton was absolutely right when, on that historic morning, he said: \"We know that a difficult path lies before us. Every peace has its own enemies - those who always prefer the easy attitudes of hatred to the hard task of reconciliation.\" Ecuador believes in peace and trusts in peace and understanding. Hence, I wish to associate myself with the noble words of Cardinal Antonio Samore, the delegate of the Holy Father in the Papal mediation between the fraternal countries of Argentina and Chile, in his speech at the time 20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session of the signing, in Montevideo, of the commitment between the two countries: \"I say to all of you - Christians, believers and men of good will: do not be afraid to opt for peace, to educate for peace. The aspiration to peace will never be disappointed. The endeavour to achieve peace inspired by charity that never fails will yield its fruits. Peace will be the last word in history.\" Against this background, and with a view to ensuring that these efforts are made in an appropriate climate of genuine understanding and harmony and will be effective, I formally take the opportunity, at this rostrum, to propose to the Government of Peru that, reaffirming the commitment that both countries have made in accordance with many existing international instruments - principally, the United Nations Charter - we give our word of honour that, in our mutual relations, we shall not resort to force or to the threat of the use of force. Such a solemn commitment would underscore an essential legal obligation and amount to an eloquent additional means of promoting mutual trust; and it would be an appropriate framework for continued dialogue on the path of peace and understanding, with a view to achieving, as soon as possible, a fair, honourable and lasting settlement between the two countries. Mr. MUSYOKA (Kenya): May I, at the outset, take this opportunity to extend our most sincere condolences and deepest sympathy to the delegation, Government and people of India following the earthquake disaster, which has left thousands of people dead and many villages destroyed. We share the grief of the people of India at this sorrowful and tragic time. I should like to join those representatives who have already congratulated Mr. Insanally of Guyana on his unanimous election as President of the General Assembly of the United Nations at its forty-eighth session. His election to this high office is a demonstration of the confidence that the Member States have in him and of their respect for his country, Guyana. We are confident that, under his wise guidance, our deliberations in this session will achieve the desired results. I also wish to pay tribute to Mr. Insanallys predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, for steering the forty-seventh session to a successful conclusion. W e t h e c o m m e n d S e c r e t a r y - G e n e r a l , Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, too for the skilful and competent manner in which he is directing the Organization. Allow me to take this opportunity to congratulate the Members that were admitted to the Organization during the past year. Their admission strengthens the ideal of the universality of the United Nations. We assure them of our willingness to work closely with them in our common efforts to create a better world. The end of the cold war created an unprecedented opportunity to increase international cooperation with a view to achieving international peace and security and promoting the socio-economic progress envisaged in the United Nations Charter. However, the new challenges emerging on the global scene demand that the international community summon up the will and imagination to overcome them. The disappearance of the great ideological rivalry between East and West has resulted in a sense of soberness and improvement in relations between States. It has also led to a reduction in tensions and to significant progress in the area of disarmament, thereby creating opportunities for the conversion of massive resources to peaceful uses. Peace and security, however, is not merely the absence of war or the threat of war; it is the absence of conditions that threaten the enjoyment of life and social harmony. The United Nations now has an opportunity to put fully into effect the system of security envisaged in its Charter. This system is based on the principles of the peaceful settlement of disputes and collective action in pursuit of international peace and the maintenance of global security. Equally important, the world has an opportunity to build pillars of peace by tackling sources of instability in the economic, social, humanitarian and ecological fields. The brutal war in Bosnia, the destruction of Somalia and the protracted civil wars in Angola and elsewhere confirm the futility of the use of force as a means of solving disputes. The ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I) by the Governments of the United States of America and the Russian Federation and their signing of the START II Agreements in January 1993 are significant developments in disarmament. The primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament rests with those States that possess the nuclear arsenals. Kenya, however, strongly believes that the international community as a whole must be involved and should contribute to measures intended to achieve nuclear disarmament and the non-proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction. Forty-eighth session - 5 October l993 21 Contrary to expectations, the collapse of the bipolar world order has not given way to a new order of peace and democracy and improved socio-economic situations. The emerging order has raised new challenges and new approaches to solutions. As Members of the United Nations family, we need to redouble our efforts with vision and determination to balance both short- and long-term interests as we struggle to shape the new order. In many parts of the world, we are confronted with assertions of nationalism coupled with territorial claims. As the Secretary-General puts it in his Agenda for Peace, \"... the cohesion of States is threatened by brutal ethnic, religious, strife\". (, para. 11) and linguistic cultural social, Kenya subscribes to the thrust of the Agenda for Peace as elaborated during the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly, on the basis of which a draft resolution will be adopted during this session. The elaboration of the Agenda for Peace should take into account the principles of sovereignty, and non-interference in the internal affairs of nation-States. independence, territorial integrity The new approach will widen and deepen the scope of the United Nations in the promotion of the peaceful settlement of disputes and the maintenance of peace and security. In this regard, Kenya urges the full exploitation of the potential of the International Court of Justice in the adjudication of disputes between States as a potential transparent and cost-effective means of conflict resolution. The case of Somalia is particularly distressing. We strongly believe that keeping United Nations peace-keeping personnel in Somalia is critical to the pursuit of peace and security in that country. We note with appreciation the Secretary-Generals report that, despite several incidences of there are improvements in the violence in Mogadishu, overall starvation, establishment of a large number of district councils, opening of schools and resumption of normal life in most areas of the country. including eradication of situation, We also welcome Security Council resolution 865 (1993) of 22 September, by which the Council, inter alia, invites the Secretary-General to consult the countries of the region and regional organizations concerned on means of further reinvigorating the reconciliation process. We believe that the regional peace initiatives can effectively complement the United Nations efforts in facilitating reconciliation between all the factions in Somalia. The highest priority is to assist the people of Somalia in furthering the national reconciliation process and to promote and advance the re-establishment of regional and national institutions and civil administration in the entire country, as set out in Security Council resolution 814 (1993). This requires improvement of the dialogue between the United Nations personnel in Somalia and the general Somali public as an essential element in confidence-building to facilitate reconciliation between the various factions. Kenya shares an 800-kilometre-long border with Somalia. In many ways, we are extremely exposed to the Somalia problem. Somalia is a sister country with which we share family relations as well as ethnic and cultural affinities. The very heavy influx of Somali refugees into Kenya has had a devastating effect on the most ecologically fragile parts of the country. The border region has suffered serious environmental destruction as a result of excessive cutting of trees for building materials and firewood. The physical and social infrastructures have been overstretched by excessive usage and overloading. Most seriously, our people and security personnel have been subjected to numerous acts of banditry by armed gangs crossing into Kenya from Somalia, causing general insecurity in the border region. We have continued to lose both civilians and security personnel at an unacceptably high rate as a result of attacks by bandits. Huge numbers of livestock and huge quantities of other property have also been lost to them. As peace is being restored in Somalia, we are cooperating with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to accelerate the voluntary repatriation of the same time, we are requesting the United Nations and the donor community to urgently assist Kenya with programmes for the rehabilitation of the physical and social infrastructures as well as for the restoration of the ecosystem in the region. refugees. At We are also requesting the Secretary-General to the United Nations Operation in Somalia reinforce (UNOSOM) patrols along the Somali side of the border so as to complement the Kenyan security personnel on our side. We believe that the joint security efforts will significantly scale down the flow of armed gangs and individuals into Kenya. the efforts of Sudan is another neighbouring country that has for a long time now been suffering devastating civil strife. The problem has been of great concern not only to the neighbouring countries but also to the Organization of 22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations. There is an urgent need for the United Nations to support the ongoing regional efforts spearheaded by Presidents Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Afwerki of Eritrea and Zenawi of Ethiopia under the chairmanship of President Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya. We appeal to be to all parties involved in the conflict flexible in the search for a just and lasting solution. The experience of Somalia and other regional conflicts convinces us that there is an urgent need for the United Nations to re-evaluate the existing international control systems for conventional-weapon production and trade. The widespread availability of deadly conventional weapons constitutes the most important factor in the prolongation of regional and civil conflicts. Elsewhere in our continent, efforts to find solutions to ethnic and other conflicts have shown encouraging trends. We are confident that the people of Mozambique, Rwanda and Liberia will realize their dreams of peace through the process of dialogue. Greater involvement by the United Nations in the Rwandese peace process is pertinent at this It is essential that the peace accords signed in these stage. countries be honoured by all the parties, with effective support from the United Nations, the OAU and regional bodies, and with generous assistance from friendly countries. The situation in Angola is very disturbing. The ongoing bloodshed could easily have been avoided if the UNITA leadership had accepted the verdict of the people in the elections. We appeal to UNITA to agree to a dialogue for a peaceful political solution, with the mediation and increased support of the United Nations, OAU and the sponsors of the Peace Accords. the creation of We are also greatly encouraged by the developments that have taken place in South Africa. The agreement reached for the Transitional Executive Council and the setting of a date for the first democratic elections pave the way for the establishment of a truly non-racial, democratic South Africa. We support the recent call by Mr. Nelson Mandela, the President of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC), for all diplomatic and economic sanctions against South Africa to be lifted. The recently concluded, momentous agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) marks a turning point in the process of finding a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian and, indeed, the Middle East problem. We are encouraged by the assurances that this is the first tangible step towards the establishment of a Palestinian State alongside Israel. We wish the Palestinian and Israeli people happy and peaceful coexistence. Further afield, we welcome the successful holding of the elections under United Nations auspices in Cambodia, the conclusion of the Governors Island Agreement on the restoration of a democratically elected Government of Haiti, and the progress towards the establishment of lasting peace in El Salvador. With its increased responsibilities and challenges, the United Nations needs to be restructured and revitalized so that it can effectively discharge its responsibilities. It must also be provided with adequate resources. The tasks ahead demand that the energy and attention of all components of the United Nations be engaged fully and appropriately. The General Assembly must be enabled to play its full role in decisions affecting international peace and security. There is a need to establish a balanced relationship between the Assembly and the other principal organs of the United Nations, and to ensure logical accountability of the principal organs, in particular the Security Council. The Security Council must also be reformed so that it is more and more democratic in its decision-making process, while at the same time its effectiveness is ensured. transparent, more representative recommendations The ongoing restructuring and revitalization of the Economic and Social Council and the United Nations in the economic, social and related fields should strengthen the Council and enable it to play a central role in providing policy the General Assembly. Similarly, the ongoing efforts to restructure the Secretariat must be balanced and accord appropriate priority to development concerns. the Organization must be provided with adequate resources on a sustainable basis to enable it effectively to promote socio-economic progress in accordance with its Charter. Operational activities of to Peace-keeping operations have increasingly become among the most utilized and widely acceptable instruments of the Organization, especially in discharging its primary responsibility in the maintenance of international peace and security. The operations have also increasingly taken on new and broader assignments and responsibilities. Kenya is happy to be closely associated with peace-keeping operations. We have contributed military and police personnel to many peace-keeping operations world wide. The and scope of peace-keeping operations requires that the ability of the to manage such large-scale operations be Secretariat in the number enormous rise Forty-eighth session - 5 October l993 23 strengthened and also that Member States be ready to finance the operations. the Members of In this connection, the serious concerns expressed by the Secretary-General and his urgent appeals to Member States to pay arrears of contributions must receive a concrete and speedy response from all this Organization. The formula for apportioning contributions should reflect the special responsibility of the permanent members of the Security Council and of other developed countries and take into account the relatively limited capacities of developing countries. A dramatic change in the formula of contributions could, I submit, complicate further the problem of arrears. the peace-keeping reserve fund would go a long way towards making peace-keeping operations more efficient. In this regard, a timely and effective response by the United Nations will largely depend on the availability of adequate resources, at least in the initial stages, to cater for the critical time lost in negotiations for the financing of peace-keeping operations. It is also important that a formula be developed to establish a more predictable financial basis for the peace-keeping operations. The establishment of increased protectionism, The uncertainty prevailing in the world economy today is a cause for serious concern. Insufficient growth in the developed countries has contributed to the unfavourable external conditions that threaten the political, economic and social stability of many developing countries. These include renewed pressures for falling commodity prices and the decline in financial flows, among other conditions. Despite the far-reaching economic and political reforms which have been put in place by most African countries in the last the situation continues to be grim, since the region continues to experience economic growth of less than 2 per cent. The current trends, if not reversed, threaten to marginalize further the participation of African countries in the global economy. three years, The liberalization of the African economies and the hard work of the African people are not in themselves sufficient to transform the socio-economic situation in Africa. is not playing the international The continent economic game with other continents on a level ground. We wish, therefore, to underscore the need for the international community to seize the opportunity created by the positive changes taking place on the continent and give Africa real support so that the gains made for economic and democratic reform will be sustainable. At the same time, African countries should continue to integration efforts within the regional strengthen their regional bodies already established, such as the Preferential Trade Area for the Eastern and Southern African Countries (PTA), the Inter-Governmental Authority for Drought and Development (IGADD) in the Horn of Africa, and the ongoing efforts to revive East African cooperation. Our experience in Kenya in implementing structural adjustment programmes is that the reforms have inherent negative short-term effects, particularly on the poor and the other vulnerable members of society. These include the fall in their purchasing power owing to the liberalization of prices, job losses through a reduction of manpower in the public sector, and the reduction of government expenditure on such essential social services as health, education and other The donor community needs, to balance the aid conditionalities with the therefore, socio-economic countries implementing structural adjustment programmes, particularly by addressing the social dimensions of such programmes in concrete and human terms. infrastructures. obtaining realities in the The United Nations new agenda for the development of Africa in the 1990s, adopted by the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session, commits the international community to implement concrete and effective measures to support Africas own efforts in the process of economic reforms and development. The success of the implementation of the programme will depend, first, on the efforts of the African countries themselves and, secondly, on the back-up resources from multilateral and bilateral donors. We are concerned that these resources are shrinking owing to diversion and what appears to be a subtle disengagement from Africa. The acute external debt of African countries and the heavy and unbearable burden of servicing that debt are among the matters on which concrete action is needed. The burden of debt-servicing drains the continent of over $10 billion annually, thus diverting resources badly needed for investment and alleviation of poverty. On trade, it is gratifying to note that, after six months of stalemate, multilateral negotiations of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) have resumed. We emphasize, however, that the outcome of the negotiations should be balanced to take account of the particular needs of the poor developing countries. The World Conference on Human Rights, which was held in Vienna, Austria, in June this year, marked a significant watershed for the international community on the important question of human rights. That Conference emphasized that human rights are interdependent and 24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session It recognized development as a basic human indivisible. right. Democracy, development and human rights go hand in hand, as experience has shown that it is difficult to guarantee some basic rights, especially economic and social rights, in situations of abject poverty. As I emphasized in my statement at that Conference, the existing international institutions for human rights need strengthening. At the same time, developing countries require support and assistance to strengthen their domestic institutions and build strong foundations for the rule of law and the administration of justice. the of ensuring effectiveness Since the Rio Conference on Environment and Development, Governments and international agencies have focused their attention on the implementation of Agenda 21. The first substantive meeting of the Commission on Sustainable Development, held in June this year, made tangible progress in adopting crucial decisions on its work programme. Kenya welcomes the progress being made towards the Global Environmental Facility as an important for funding incremental costs related to the implementation of Agenda 21. However, we are concerned that adequate financial resources for the implementation of the programme have fallen short of expectations. On institutional arrangements, while Kenya supports the mandate given to the Commission on Sustainable Development in regard to monitoring progress in the implementation of Agenda 21, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) must continue to play a central role owing to the experience and expertise it has accumulated over the years in the area of the environment. The need to strengthen UNEP to enable it to participate effectively in the implementation of Agenda 21 can therefore not be overemphasized. instrument the facilities conference Accordingly, at UNEP Headquarters in Nairobi must be put to full use. It is neither economically sound nor in keeping with the objective of strengthening UNEP to have many meetings initiated by the Organization held outside its Headquarters. As a host country, Kenya shall continue to provide all the necessary assistance to UNEP to enable it to play its central and, indeed, its rightful role. As the Secretariat of the United Nations undergoes restructuring, we should be mindful of the mandates of various agencies and bodies in order to avoid the possibility of losing the original objective. Kenya is concerned that the role of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat), whose Headquarters are in Nairobi, is being eroded by the undue delay in filling the post of Executive Director, despite the concerns expressed by the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. The filling of the post will give the required impetus to the Habitat secretariat. Mr. Pursoo (Grenada), Vice-President, took the Chair. As to the social issues, I wish to assure members of our cooperation with the international community in the preparatory work for the forthcoming Conference on Population and Development, the Fourth World Conference on Women, also to be held in 1994; and the World Summit for Social Development, set for 1995. We need to put all our energies into the preparatory work of these Conferences to ensure that they achieve their intended objectives. to be held next year; In conclusion, the international community, through this Assembly, must make every effort to face these challenges and many more which are yet to come. We owe it to posterity and to future generations to leave this world a better place to live in. We have neither excuses nor reasons to fail. And if we do fail, history will judge us harshly. In this endeavour, our differences should strengthen rather than weaken us, for in unity lies our strength. In the words of our beloved President, His Excellency Daniel Teroitich Arap Moi, love, peace and unity are the pillars for development and progress. Mr. SHIHMURADOV (Turkmenistan) (interpretation from Russian): First of all, I should like to congratulate the President on his assumption of his important post at the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I should also like to express my gratitude for making it possible for me to comply with the instructions of the President of Turkmenistan, Mr. Niyazov, and the entire Turkmen population in speaking to the world community. A unique situation prevails in the world today. There are no longer two inimical camps, and we virtually have eliminated the most pressing problem of global nuclear conflict. Furthermore, ridding ourselves of the ideological yoke has freed us from internal conflicts and contradictions. As political scientists said after the end of the standoff between the two blocs, we now have on the world agenda urgent problems - new and bloody regional and internal conflicts, which are no less dangerous to the world than a global confrontation. What are the reasons for this seemingly unfathomable outbreak of aggressiveness and conflict? In our view, the answer to this question can be found in the lack of political pragmatism and in a failure to understand realities. One of Forty-eighth session - 5 October l993 25 the major reasons is the lack of a deep-seated political culture and of restraint, and the desire to do everything at once. But there are no miracles. We need political courage, which has been demonstrated by the President of Turkmenistan, in order to avoid the pitfalls of unrealistic decisions, something which might, to put it mildly, lead to social disappointment. From the very first days of our independent existence, Turkmenistan found itself faced with a whole series of difficult and unique problems, which were determined by the special characteristics of its attaining statehood. Proclaiming its sovereignty and independence is only the starting-point for a lengthy process which is to lead to the establishment of an efficient political system, a strong national economy and a workable social structure. this, we need essentially not just reforms but a full reorientation of the political system and of the economy. I should like to emphasize especially this aspect, since at the same time very difficult reforms will be needed in other areas as well. For The natural economic and social development of our people was interrupted for seven long decades. As a result, people lost the notion of private property, and their ways of thinking and social morals became out of touch. This is an important aspect, and we should bear this mind in establishing new States on a new legal basis. At the present time, the most important possessions of all the citizens of Turkmenistan are independence and the opportunity to solve their problems independently. Perhaps this would seem to be axiomatic, but as we see it, of the entire system of priorities formulated by the Government of our country, this is the most desirable in the current circumstances prevailing in Turkmenistan and in the area. In order to achieve large-scale reforms of the political and economic system in Turkmenistan, a programme of \"10 years of stability\" has been adopted. What are the tasks of that programme? First and foremost, to wean the economy away from the notion of State property, in particular from a foodstuff-dominated economy and production towards the production of prepared products. The second is the formation of the political, economic, social, spiritual and cultural life of the State, without the infamous system - inherited from the past - of roles played out in advance. Thirdly is the formation and development of democratic institutions, including a multi-party system. Against the background of these processes, we see social psychology transformed, away from political apathy and the lack of responsibility. In this regard, we are trying to pursue our policy in such a way that we would strengthen our ability to avoid social upheaval, breakdowns in all sectors of society and the lack of social harmony. This is not easy. The people of Turkmenistan need unity and solidarity. This gives us hope for the future, however. Pragmatism will be a determinant in overcoming our difficulties in establishing the major criteria for Turkmenistans current foreign policy. In solving these economic problems, we are offering to our foreign partners businesslike cooperation without any ideological or political passions, and we have found understanding everywhere. The logical outcome of this development has led us to the formulation of a foreign-policy concept of positive neutrality, which is in keeping with the national interests of our State and in the interest of maintaining peace and stability in the region. In solving military problems, we have been guided by our neutral status, which stems from the principle of non- interference in the internal affairs of States and the recognition of territorial integrity and the inviolability of their borders. It is well known that sometimes the concept of non-interference can be questionable or even rejected. But in our view, a new independent State in Europe and Asia also needs conditions for the peaceful resolution of its internal problems in order to achieve civil calm and in order to find the necessary compromises. Obviously, based on military force, we cannot achieve development and progress in the broad sense of the word. And we need to move away from internationalizing the internal problems of various States through military force. At the same time, we support the peace-keeping actions of the United Nations and other international organizations. These are the factors that determine our view of events in Tajikistan. I can state that our position has found support and understanding among other countries. We have reached agreement with the leadership of Iran on a new agreement, one of the most important conditions of which is the transformation of the 1,500-kilometre border between Iran and Turkmenistan into a border of peace and cooperation. We are actively engaged in political dialogue with the central Government of Afghanistan and also with the authorities of the northern and north-western provinces. Such a policy has brought positive results. Recently we signed a three-party memorandum on the construction of a railroad from Turkmenistan to Pakistan through Afghanistan. In addition, Afghanistan will see the first major railroad in its history. We will make it possible, therefore, to have an outlet to the ports of the Indian Ocean through the States of Central Asia and Europe. 26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session Speaking of relations with our neighbours, we must especially emphasize the role of Russia in the creation of an independent Turkmenistan. We well understand that this process began in Russia and was initiated by its leadership. A high degree of understanding at the level of leadership and the traditional mutual respect of our peoples has established a lasting basis for the development of mutually advantageous bilateral cooperation on new and equitable bases. In speaking of this, I should like from this rostrum to state that Turkmenistan supports the efforts of the leadership of Russia to establish order and to establish conditions for the active continuation of political reforms and the full dismantling of the totalitarian system and its replacement with a system chosen by the people. Turkmenistan is actively developing relations with Turkey, Austria, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Pakistan, Malaysia, Germany, France, Argentina and Italy, and constructive dialogue with the United States is under way. President Niyazovs recent visit to Belgium laid the groundwork for new cooperation between Turkmenistan and the countries of the European Community and between Turkmenistan and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We are also opening a number of Turkmenistan Embassies abroad. In short, our country is actively involved in international relations. We support those agreements that will lead to an end of confrontation and make possible peaceful and constructive dialogue. Among those agreements, we note with satisfaction the recent changes in the relationship between Israel and the PLO. Turkmenistans geopolitical situation - our country is a member of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and is at the same time connected by deep historical and cultural roots to the Middle and Far East - enables us, in view of our countrys stability, to play a constructive role in bridging the gap between two major regions of the world. I should like to say a few words on Turkmenistans position vis-a-vis the Commonwealth of Independent States. Turkmenistan is in favour of the Commonwealth, in favour of the development of integrationist processes and, while it opposed the establishment of any kind of rigid centralized system in the past it is in favour of coordinating structures. In our view, the coming forth today of super-national formations has held back the process of independence and has now led back to the former system of decision by force. In States that have arisen since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, we now see respect for national interests alone, and we see only the bare beginnings of a process of inter-State relations on new, qualitatively different bases. The statehood of these countries is a difficult matter, and this process must respect national specificities and social and economic factors. If all these factors are borne in mind, any kind of rigid coordinating structure is impossible. Attempts artificially to impose positions and a unified model for development on new independent States cannot but work against sovereignty and national In the final analysis, such an approach would lead to the establishment of a new centre. interests. From the very outset, Turkmenistan actively attempted to develop relations with the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States on the basis of bilateral relations and various types of agreements, in view of the fact that the Commonwealth is primarily a consultative mechanism that gives us the opportunity to exchange ideas and experience and to lay down programmes of action. We feel that such an approach is more flexible and therefore more effective. Experience has shown that at this current stage - and I emphasize, at this current stage - bilateral agreements are a more reliable basis for solving problems as they arise. We often see the example of the European Community, and, supposedly, the same thing could happen in our region. To my mind, anyone who tries to achieve what the European Community has done over 40 years is not taking into the high-level starting-point account some essential factors: of the unification of Europe, the very different market basis of its economies and what might be called the European psychology. We have none of these factors. future relations, It is important to establish the fact that if we cannot count on our the Commonwealth of Independent of States has no prospects. We in Turkmenistan believe, and have always believed, that a solution should be found within the framework of the Commonwealth, should be adopted by consensus and should be very broad and based primarily on economic feasibility and attractiveness. This will be only the first step, and it needs to be followed by others on a higher level of integration. But for this, the Commonwealth of Independent States and the countries of which it is composed need a period of transition in order to work out acceptable approaches and adequately evaluate the existing realities. Over two years of independent development, we have done a great deal of work in establishing a legal basis for the market. We have already established the basis and guarantees that opened up the Turkmen market to foreign investors and enterprises. In Forty-eighth session - 5 October l993 27 the such as international events, The stronger our economy, the more reliable the fabric of political and social life in our State. At the same time, we believe that economic development is inconceivable without our countrys steady development of a society in which the individual and his interests are regarded as the most important end. For Turkmenistan, which for 70 years had a totalitarian system with backward social development, development of the economy remains the keystone of our In this context, along with other forthcoming State policy. major the International Conference on Population and Development, the Fourth World Conference on Women, with the three objectives, equality, development and peace, and the International Conference on Population and Development, which will deal with problems of human beings and their need for shelter, we welcome the preparations for the World Summit for Social Development, to be held in Copenhagen in 1995, which will deal, we think, in detail with social consequences of economic reform and restructuring as applied to countries in transition. In the context of social problems, I should like to point out that in 1990 we had the World Summit for Children, which established a new basis for improving living conditions for children the world over. The Government of Turkmenistan gives priority attention to these endeavours. Turkmenistan joined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and intends very soon to sign the Declaration that was adopted at that World Summit. We also have serious work under way for national programmes of action in order to achieve the goals outlined in the Declaration. We welcome attention the United Nations specialized agencies have paid us with regard to our problems. Despite our difficulties and the problems yet to be solved, the Republic has achieved considerable success. Over the first six months of 1993, Turkmenistans national income increased by 112 per cent. Such growth would not have been achieved by many States in a similar situation. Over that same period industrial output increased by 116.9 per and agricultural production increased by 124 per cent. cent, introduced private property, Turkmenistan we have including land, and we have established zones of free economic development. Today we have a stable political situation and social agreement. It is important that society be psychologically prepared for new economic relations. On 1 November this year, Turkmenistan will introduce its own national monetary unit, the manat. We are in an extremely unstable monetary zone, which would mean certain limitations for Turkmenistan if we gave up our sovereignty and formed our own policy regarding prices, taxation, budgeting, credit and monetary policy. Hence, our country has sometimes absorbed some losses because of continuing inflation and the economic crisis. from the time we introduce it, All of this was conditioned by the need to introduce our own currency. We believe that our own currency policy will be closely linked to that of the United States dollar, and we intend to ensure, its convertibility. According to prognoses of international experts and our own evaluations, we have a real opportunity of doing this. The manat will be a reliable currency for the State reserves. The introduction of a national currency policy will hasten structural changes in the economy and bring us closer to the market. With the International Monetary Fund we have worked up a programme of structural economic changes, including a step-by-step process. From 1 October we have begun a broad liberalization of prices, including plans to enter the world price system and this also includes energy prices. With the introduction of the manat as our currency we are beginning active privatization, which involves, first and foremost, the sphere of services in the area of medium-sized and large enterprises. This is to be done by selling enterprises at auction and distributing shares among workers. We hope to conclude the privatization process by the end of 1995. that I should like to point out the privatization programme has been carried out in close cooperation with the World Bank. In addition, measures to free prices have been undertaken by the Government in order to free up trade. Licensing of exports will take place with a view to observing norms ensured through national security and the protection of our cultural and artistic heritage. We shall also undertake other steps designed to promote maximum stimulation of international trade and eliminate administrative barriers and to increase access to the market. In a time of transition to a market economy, we intend to make the States role more streamlined and open and significantly reduce its interference in economic activities. 28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session We share the view of the international community that we must rebuild the Earths ecology. We support international cooperation in United Nations efforts in this timely endeavour. In our view, it is sustainable development and balanced attention to the interests of all countries that will ensure the successful solution of global, regional and subregional problems; should accord with the conclusions of the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and of the Convention on climate change. this I announce before the Assembly that Turkmenistan intends to eliminate all its nuclear weapons and will continue its support for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons the chemical weapons Convention, and for the bacteriological (biological) weapons Convention. (NPT), for I convey the gratitude of the President of Turkmenistan, of our Government and of our people to the United Nations for its support and its understanding. I should also like to pay a tribute to the Secretary- General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his tireless and innovative work. Turkmenistan wishes to state without reserve that it will honestly and openly cooperate with all States that share its attachment to the principles of the Organization. Our policies will be based on common sense and on protecting our peoples in creating a democratic, secular State, is open to peaceful cooperation and ready to engage in broadly-based, mutually beneficial cooperation.
