{"speech":{"0":" It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Ambassador Insanally on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. His election to this important post is, beyond a doubt, a testimony to his personal credentials and the important role being played by his country in international affairs. I should also like to commend the work of his of Bulgaria, who of and predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev demonstrated skills dedication. outstanding diplomacy, It is also my pleasant duty to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his untiring efforts in promoting international peace and security. I should also like to extend a warm welcome to the six new States, Andorra, the Czech Republic, Eritrea, Monaco, the Slovak Republic and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia that have joined us during the past year. I am confident that their participation and contribution will further enrich the work of the Organization. Along with the end of the cold war came promises: promises of a better future, without the threat of nuclear holocaust, where scarce resources would not be spent on building up military might, where millions of starving would be fed and provided with their basic health care needs, safe drinking water and a basic level of education, where a safe and clean environment would be provided along with the right to sustainable development, and where the dignity of the human being would be respected. This is the vision that gave rise to this Organization in 1945. We have rededicated ourselves to this vision with renewed vigour following the demise of the cold war. The 30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session moral authority of the United Nations has been reasserted over military might. A number of protracted conflicts have shown signs of movement towards resolution. International cooperation in addressing global issues such as environment, disarmament, international peace and security and human rights have reached new heights. As a consequence, the United Nations has gained new respect and been entrusted with new responsibilities. In order to live up to the heightened expectations, the Organization must continue to receive the unwavering commitment of its Member States. The Republic of Maldives would like to take this opportunity to renew its commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. These changes in the work of the United Nations reflect corresponding changes in the political, economic, and security landscape that underpins efforts in international cooperation today. In view of this reality, the Security Council of the United Nations needs to be reformed and restructured. We should be careful not to take a piecemeal approach to this: any expansion of the Council, and the status of the members, should be based on the principles of equitable and balanced representation. We should formulate principled criteria that reflect the political, economic and demographic realities of the world today. The events in Bosnia and Herzegovina have shamed us all. A State Member of the United Nations has been subjected to naked aggression. The entire population of a small country is being progressively exterminated. It is deliberate genocide. We need to examine why the international community has failed to stop the carnage that is taking place in that country. Regional, international and direct diplomacy have been applied, but to no avail. At a time when the world community has rededicated itself to the sanctity of human rights, it is a tragic shame that systematic violation of these rights has gone unpunished owing to lack of will on the part of the international community. We condemn the continued violence and genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina and call upon the international community to take more decisive steps the responsibilities entrusted to us under the Charter of this Organization may be discharged fully. We fully recognize the inherent right to self-defence, as prescribed in the Charter. We believe that the right to self-defence comprises the most fundamental right - the right to life. so that A permanent solution to the situation in Bosnia should be found by peaceful means and within the parameters of the Charter of the United Nations, one of which is the principle of territorial integrity. The continued violations of basic human rights that are taking place in Angola and Somalia are a matter of serious concern to us. The events in Somalia - especially the attacks on the United Nations peace-keeping personnel - are grave developments that threaten the working of this Organization. United Nations involvement in Somalia now raises several questions, including those concerning the sincerity of the warring parties with regard to their acceptance of help from the international community to overcome the extreme poverty that has ravaged the entire country. Today, the United Nations is learning a lesson that is very expensive, in terms of both human life and financial resources, as it provides humanitarian assistance and seeks to protect the people of these countries. It is indeed ironic and tragic that peace- keepers have themselves become targets of violence. My Government condemns such violence in the strongest possible terms and believes that those responsible for such acts should be brought to justice. These experiences demonstrate that the parties involved are not sincere in the efforts to find a peaceful solution and to avoid violence, the United Nations, acting on its own, will be unable to perform miracles. if Developments taking place in South Africa have been encouraging. The very active and high-level role currently being played by the United Nations in facilitating the cessation of political violence and the promotion of negotiations to establish a democratic and non-racial State in South Africa is commendable. My Government also commends the African National Congress (ANC) and the Government of South Africa for their positive attitude towards working out the details of the multi-party elections. In this connection, to set up a multi-party Transitional Executive Council is a welcome development. We feel that the end of the era of apartheid, which is an affront to human dignity, is imminent. In this context, we urge all parties concerned to refrain from violence and actions that would subvert the peace process. the recent agreement It is our hope that when we meet here in New York next year we shall have amongst us the true representatives of the South African people and that this Organization will be able to benefit from their experience and knowledge. Forty-eighth session - 4 October l993 31 The Arab-Israeli peace talks that began in 1991 have made remarkable progress. The signing of the declarations of principles by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel in Washington last month was an historic event. In this context, I should like to express to the PLO and the people of Palestine our admiration for their courage and their determination to find a comprehensive and peaceful solution to the question of Palestine. The Maldives pays tribute also to the Government of the United States of America and other Governments involved for the important role they are playing in the Middle East peace talks. It is our earnest hope that this agreement will lead to the restoration of the inalienable right of the Palestine people to self-determination, sovereign independence and the establishment of a national homeland on their own soil. The tragic consequences of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait are still a matter of serious concern to the international community. All outstanding issues, such as the border dispute and the release of Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners still being held in Iraqi jails, should be settled immediately. The resolution of these issues, in conformity with international law and practice, will contribute to the elimination of tension and to the restoration of security and stability in the region. In this regard, the Government of Maldives welcomes the completion of the work of the Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission and the endorsement of the report of this Commission by the Security Council. We also feel that Kuwaits acceptance of the Commissions report is a very positive step indicative of that countrys eagerness and sincerity in its attitude towards a comprehensive solution. The Government of Maldives urges Iraq to adopt an equally positive attitude in the interests of peace, security and stability. In June this year the international community came together at the second World Conference on Human Rights to review and assess progress and setbacks in the area of human rights since the adoption of the Universal Declaration in 1948. I am happy that we were able to make considerable progress in several key areas. We believe that some of the achievements of this Conference will give new impetus to the promotion of human rights throughout the world. However, we all need to be very realistic in addressing this very important issue. The international community should not let the promotion of human rights be used by a few as an excuse for imposing uniformity in human behaviour and thinking, at the expense of diversity. it should emphasize the significance of the Rather, universality of human rights. We know only too well the fate of societies that try to impose uniform thinking and behaviour on their peoples. Differences between individuals and societies should be valued. Such diversity enriches our family of nations. It is our firm belief that The Government of Maldives has always attached great importance to disarmament and international peace and security. the production and stockpiling of armaments will only worsen the security of the entire world. In this regard, Maldives calls upon the international community not to lose the current momentum towards disarmament. We therefore urge the parties involved to continue to build upon past achievements, particularly in the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, the control of proliferation, the achievement of greater transparency in armaments and the negotiation of other confidence-building measures. Early this year, Maldives acceded to the Convention on the Development, Production and the Prohibition of Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction, and, today, on behalf of the Government of Maldives, I have signed the Convention. Maldives is not involved in the production and stockpiling of such weapons. My Governments accession and signature therefore demonstrate our commitment to supporting all international efforts to eradicate such weaponry. independence in 1965. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was one of the first international Treaties to which my country became a party after gaining its Our commitment to this Treaty is unwavering because we fully realize the consequences of the proliferation of such weapons of mass destruction. My Government supports the indefinite extension of the Treaty beyond 1995. We believe that, within its framework, progress could be made in the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace, for which my Government reiterates its full support. We feel that the establishment of such zones will further contribute to the promotion of international peace and security. I also wish to express my Governments unqualified support for the total eradication of all weapons of mass destruction, be it chemical, biological or nuclear, and to reiterate our call for the conclusion of effective agreements on a comprehensive ban on nuclear In this the Government of Maldives commends the connection, United States for its unilateral decision to extend its moratorium on nuclear testing until the end of 1994. testing. 32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session The Charter of the United Nations recognizes the inherent rights of all States to self-defence. However, only a privileged few possess the ability to provide for their own security unilaterally. Small States which lack adequate financial resources for the acquisition of military equipment and face severe constraints in manpower are never in a position to provide suitably for their own security. Any attempt by small States to build their military capabilities up to a level of even near self-reliance would be a mere waste of resources. The United Nations remains the only guarantor of security for the small States. In the economic sphere, the world economy once again failed to meet the expected rate of growth. It continues to be characterized by deteriorating terms of trade for the developing countries and rising protectionism in developed countries. For decades the developing countries have sought a new world economic order that would eliminate the imbalances existing in the present system. However, little has been accomplished towards the attainment of this goal. The scientific and technological gap between the developing and the developed countries is becoming ever wider. The flow of official development assistance has declined as a result of the slow growth in the economies of the donor countries. The global arrangements and institutions established to manage economic relations between States have not been able to lift the world from its present depression. This failure has serious implications for the developing countries. In order to avoid disastrous consequences, we call for an early conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that will set the tone for a future based on an open- trading system. The North-South dialogue must be reactivated on a new basis comprising common interests and benefits and shared responsibilities. Similarly, South-South cooperation must be intensified, allowing States to pool their resources and pursue concrete development efforts within the framework of collective self-reliance and continued support for open trading systems. The world cannot rise out of its economic disarray and be assured of stability until the North and the South can together work out a system that encourages closer economic the North-South exchange. and strengthens relations One particular concept that needs emphasis is the inseparability of development from the equitable sharing of its fruits and its responsibilities. This twofold aspect of development must be pursued at one and the same time and In this with equal intensity if development is to succeed. regard, let me reiterate my Governments firm belief that sustainable development is the only way to guarantee continued life on this planet Earth. We need to accelerate our efforts to meet the commitments we made in Rio last year. We call on all States urgently to ratify the climate Convention and the bio-diversity Convention. My Government is proud to announce that it was one of the first to ratify both these Conventions. The establishment of the Commission on Sustainable Development is a welcome development. We commend the Commission for the very productive work accomplished at its first substantive session and hope that its future work will be of the same high standard. The preparatory work for the Global Conference for Small Island States on Sustainable Development and its Implications began during this year. My country, as a small island State, regards this Conference as a very important step in addressing and finding practical solutions to the unique problems facing us in our developmental efforts. We hope that the international community will continue to participate constructively in the preparatory process and will participate in the Conference itself. The responsibility that has been thrust upon us today is tremendous. The realization of the dreams of our peoples are in our hands. We cannot afford to be blind to the desires of our peoples to be better fed, to have safer drinking water, to have access to education and health-care needs and to be free from the prospect of nuclear holocaust and the dangers of environmental degradation. We cannot afford to be embroiled in the build-up of stockpiles of armaments and weapons of mass destruction while our economies are the main victims of these acquisitions for death and destruction. We should rise above all this and become more human in all our endeavours. I have no doubt that together we can actually achieve the better future that has been promised to us. Mr. MESFIN (Ethiopia): It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Ambassador Insanally of Guyana on his election to the high office of the presidency of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I am also delighted to welcome the new Members of the Organization. In this regard allow me to welcome especially the State of Eritrea as a Member of the United Nations. At the end of a cruel war the people of Eritrea exercised their right to self-determination and opted for Forty-eighth session - 4 October l993 33 sovereign statehood in a referendum which won praise from the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity and other international organizations as being free and fair. Addis Ababa and Asmara took steps immediately to forge a new era of close relationship and cooperation. The healing of the wounds of war has progressed dramatically. Building for shared prosperity is progressing in earnest. Ethiopia believes that the spirit in which the Eritrean problem was resolved, as well as the developments taking place to forge a basis for permanent peace and all- round cooperation, is a unique manifestation of the era of change from conflict to concord. Peace has provided us with the opportunity to concentrate on reconstruction and lay the groundwork for sustainable development in Ethiopia and in Eritrea. integration on a new plane. The vision of the Ethiopian and Eritrean leaderships and peoples is for economic, social and cultural integration leading to political The leaderships of the two countries have a vision for expanding such integration to include the countries of the subregion. The establishment of peace and stability is therefore a priority agenda in the coordinated efforts of our two Governments and we are determined to pursue our objectives, be. Nevertheless, we recognize that the Ethiopian and Eritrean situation does not cover all the hopes and expectations for the changes that have taken place in the last few years. hurdles may however difficult the As there are encouraging developments in some parts of the world, we are also witnessing painful situations in others. The crisis in Somalia is a case in point. Since this crisis is at the heart of my Governments concerns, I would like to beg the indulgence of this Assembly to take a few moments to make a brief comment on the disturbing developments there. It is to be recalled that the Security Councils decision to restore order and to open the channels for the delivery of humanitarian aid was put into effect in December 1992 and thereafter. Immediate action was then taken to bring together the warring factions as well as representatives of various sectors of Somali society. The aim was to secure their agreement on a plan of action for the restoration of peace and the establishment of the structures of civil administration. In particular, the reconciliation input of the high-level Horn of Africa Standing Committee on Somalia was brought to bear at the Conference held in Addis Ababa in March of this year. An agreement was hammered out on a series of measures leading to peace and political stability The main elements of the agreement in the country. included a cease-fire; a programme of disarmament; regional reconciliation; measures on finding a political solution to be achieved through the establishment of elected district and regional councils, to culminate in the establishment of a transitional national council as the highest organ of state; and the principles for the settlement of conflicts relating to property claims. Concurrently, the Addis Ababa agreement of March 1993 provides for modalities of continuing humanitarian relief and the initiation of rehabilitation as well as reconstruction programmes. The United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) was to manage peace-keeping and the maintenance of an appropriate environment for the execution of rehabilitation and reconstruction programmes. It was then hoped that implementation of the political aspects of the Addis Ababa agreement would proceed as planned. However, the Somali situation took a tragic turn, particularly when, on 5 June this year, United Nations peace-keepers from Pakistan and many Somalis were killed. That was a deplorable incident indeed, and we continue to be seriously disturbed by the tragic events which have resulted since then in further loss of life with no apparent end to the crisis. Indeed, there is a deadlock and a dilemma as to how to overcome the impasse in Mogadishu. In the view of my delegation, a thorough review of all aspects of the Somali situation by the United Nations is imperative. Such a review should be aimed at restoring the situation that existed before 5 June and at proceeding from there with the implementation of the Addis Ababa In this respect, it is clear that involving the agreement. factions as well as representatives of the various sectors of Somali society in the processes is vital. UNOSOM is the last chance Somalia has. Therefore, it must not be allowed to fail. Its preoccupation with the 5 June incident should not be allowed to divert its attention reconciliation and from its ultimate goal of political economic and social rehabilitation. It must be recognized that, for the objectives of UNOSOM to be achieved, the battle for the hearts and minds of all Somalis must be won. My delegation believes that all UNOSOM troops should be materially and spiritually equipped to fight and win such a war, and that whenever there are shortcomings in that regard UNOSOM should be prepared to act promptly to redress them. Ethiopia is ready to contribute its share to such a scenario. the Organization of African Unity at its summit meeting in Cairo in June of this year gave a mandate to President Meles It will be recalled, in this regard, that 34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session Zenawi of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia to follow up and assist in the resolution of the Somali crisis. This mandate was endorsed by the fourth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD). I would like to quote from the Declaration adopted by the fourth summit of IGADD, held in Addis Ababa on 6 and 7 September 1993. \"We applaud the positive achievements of the United Nations in Somalia in preventing the death of thousands of Somalis through starvation and conflict; \"We reinforce the conviction that caution is required in handling the current very complicated political situation in Somalia; \"We further call for a meaningful consultation between UNOSOM and the countries of the subregion and reiterate the need for a more active role on the part of the countries of the subregion; \"We fully endorse the mandate given to President Meles Zenawi to follow developments in Somalia on behalf of the OAU by also mandating him to follow up the developments in that member State on behalf of the countries of the subregion.\" While the implementation of the Addis Ababa agreement is, in our considered view, the only viable avenue towards a political solution to the Somali crisis, we also regard UNOSOM as a guarantor against a slide into anarchy in Somalia. We urge UNOSOM to continue with its task until the objectives of the Addis Ababa agreement are fully achieved. The problem of refugees and persons displaced by a host of calamities continues to haunt the Horn of Africa subregion. In this regard, Ethiopia continues to face immense difficulties, the solutions of which are beyond what its meagre resources and capacities allow. On top of this, Ethiopia has to cope with the requirements of settling close to 1 million returnees. It is to be recalled that agreement on principles for the delivery of humanitarian assistance was reached with the donors at the Horn of Africa Conference held in Addis Ababa in April 1992. Those principles should be observed to ensure that relief assistance reaches the needy. Human life is precious. Denying people the right to survival, therefore, is a crime. Those who hamper the delivery of relief aid to the needy are criminals. Likewise, those who hold human survival hostage to their political agendas cannot and must not be regarded as anything but criminals. The President returned to the Chair. It may be possible to put pressure on the recipients with a view to adjusting their positions in ways that would facilitate the delivery of relief aid. But the thought of applying pressure on the donors is, to say the least, nightmarish. I would like to stress that humanitarian work should be absolutely depoliticized. With respect to other I would like to refer issues of concern to the international community, to the promising developments in South Africa. My delegation welcomes the decision on the establishment of a Transitional Executive Council responsible for supervising the process of transition towards a non-racial, democratic South Africa. We commend and support all the political leaders for their bold actions in paving the way for a peaceful transition to democracy in South Africa. Regrettably, however, there are areas of grave concern where peace has yet to materialize. In this regard, the resumption of hostilities in Angola is a blow to the stupendous efforts made by the international community and by Angolans themselves to restore peace in that country. We appeal to the parties concerned to resolve their differences at the negotiating table, taking into account the elections, which have been declared free and fair by international observers, as a reference for a political settlement of the Angolan conflict. On other areas of conflict in Africa, Ethiopia appeals to its brothers in Rwanda, Mozambique and Liberia to continue the momentum towards the establishment of peace in their respective countries. Likewise, it is Ethiopias fervent hope that our brothers in the Sudan will soon discover the happy medium that brings peace and tranquility. On the Middle East, Ethiopia welcomes the first step towards a settlement embodied in the historic agreement signed in Washington by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). We warmly congratulate the leaders of both sides on their courageous move, and hope that the momentum towards a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East conflict will pick up speed as a result. Forty-eighth session - 4 October l993 35 However, it appears that our hopes in some areas of the world are destined to be tempered by virtual despair in others. I am referring here to the tragic situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the senseless killing that seems to have no end. I call it senseless not with the intent of passing judgement on the legitimacy of the respective positions of the parties to the conflict, but rather to underline the universal belief that the dividends of peace are so much greater than the gains of an enormously destructive war. In full recognition of the fact that an end to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina is in the hands of the combatants themselves, we to them to cooperate with international mediation efforts. appeal Humanity wants peace. Thus, humanity is looking to the United Nations and hopes that this Organizations resources and fortitude will make the desired impact through preventive diplomacy, conflict management and conflict resolution. At the Organization of African Unity, at its twenty-ninth summit, held in Cairo last June, decided to establish a mechanism for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts. Ethiopia is committed effective implementation and for its success. the regional vigorously to work level, for its Our world still from encouraging. Although we are far from being satisfied, the newly emerging international situation indicates some encouraging prospects in the area of political relationships. In the field of international economic relations, however, the situation is faces far the uncomfortable reality of its division into two blocs: the affluent and the poor, the North and the South. Poverty still represents the greatest threat to democratic governance and world peace and security. Political instability, corruption, hunger, illicit drug trafficking and a litany of other evils trace their roots to mass poverty. And the international community is not unaware of the factors that have conspired to frustrate the hopes and aspirations of poor countries. Promises of special programmes for the least developed countries, 10-year action programmes and so forth agreed upon by the international community have so far made little difference by way of alleviating poverty. In Africa, overall economic growth continues to lag behind population growth. And the continent remains the poorest of all. Since there can be no stability or better prospects for the world without reducing the disparities in levels of global development, both developed and developing countries should conduct a constructive dialogue on practical measures for stimulating development. Environment and development are the two major concerns to which the international community has turned its attention. In particular, Ethiopia appreciates the international communitys support for the effort to combat desertification and drought, which are causing extensive environmental degradation in Africa. We appeal to all Member States to support fully the efforts of the intergovernmental negotiating committee for the elaboration of an international convention to combat desertification. Environmental degradation is a major development bottleneck which must be addressed as a matter of urgency. the the since establishment of This occasion provides me an opportunity to share with this Assembly a few thoughts on the situation prevailing in Ethiopia transitional Government two years ago. The process of democratization and self-rule has been consolidated through local and regional elections. The policy on equitable power-sharing among the various regions and nationalities has succeeded in ensuring peace and stability throughout the country. These, coupled with the implementation of liberalized economic reforms, reconstruction programmes and improved weather conditions, have brought about encouraging improvements in the economy. The supportive role of international financial institutions and the donor community have had a useful impact on the positive outcome of Ethiopias reconstruction and recovery efforts. Therefore, in a brief period of two years, Ethiopia has emerged from a state of despair to one of recovery. We are now looking to the future with considerable confidence. With respect to political programmes, Ethiopia has launched the final phase of the transition period with work on drafting a constitution. When the constitution is approved, multi-party elections are planned, on the basis of which permanent State structures will be put in place. Already, an independent judiciary is functioning, and legality is assuming a prominent role in guaranteeing the human rights of the people. Peaceful political activity, a free press and freedom of expression and of conscience are established features of Ethiopian life today. Our democratic attitude is working. It is working in consolidating peace and stability and in generating investor and business confidence. It has worked in restoring the confidence of the people in their own future. Ethiopia is committed to the observance of all aspects of the protection of human rights. Protection of the dignity of man also means freedom from poverty. \"Prisoner of conscience\" and \"prisoner of poverty\" are one and the same. The right to freedom of expression and the right to education 36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session are indivisible. Concern for human rights is virtually meaningless without corresponding action on the alleviation of poverty, ignorance and other causes of deprivation. Ethiopia therefore appeals to the international community to cooperate in addressing the issue of human rights in the context of these general principles. Our democratic outlook with respect to our relations with neighbouring countries and peoples has borne fruit. Ethiopia has never enjoyed such harmony, both internally and in its relations with its neighbours. Ethiopia has attained the requisite self-confidence that makes it a true partner in the community of nations. I wish therefore to reiterate the continued faith of my country in the collective wisdom of our global Organization and to pledge anew our unreserved support for the laudable efforts of the United Nations system. We believe that as the guarantor of international peace and stability, the United Nations should expand its efforts by stepping up its activities in the field of preventive diplomacy. It should develop new, more effective machinery to coordinate actions aimed at enhancing respect for the norms of international law and ensuring the security and interests of all States. role to be effective, Alongside the maintenance of international peace and security, we welcome United Nations efforts in assisting the developing countries in their endeavour to achieve a greater degree of economic development and self-reliance. The role of the United Nations in world affairs is all-inclusive. For this the Organizations methods of operation be characterized by accountability and transparency. Ethiopia subscribes to the calls for democratizing the decision-making processes of the United Nations system and for streamlining its bureaucracy. I am hopeful that at this session the General Assembly will review and assess these priority issues with a view to revitalizing the Organization so that the imperatives of the time. it can meet important it is that The PRESIDENT: A number of representatives have requested to speak in exercise of the right of reply, and I shall call upon them now. May I remind members that, in accordance with General Assembly decision , statements in exercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to five minutes for the second, and should be made by delegations from their seats. Mr. MCLEAN (United States of America): The United States notes with sadness the tone of the remarks delivered earlier today by the Foreign Minister of Cuba, particularly the disparaging approach to the efforts, hopes and accomplishments of this institution. Cuba is indeed a troubled land whose people continue to pay a heavy price for their Governments failed economic management and ideological rigidity. To shirk blame, the Cuban Government seeks refuge in misstatements, such as the totally false assertion that the United States prevents Cuba from purchasing medicine. But these and other ludicrous claims do nothing to mitigate the suffering the Cuban Government has inflicted on its people. Rather, they call the worlds attention to the increasing desperation of those who swim frenetically against economic opportunity and human rights. currents of political freedom, the Mr. NAIMI ARFA (Islamic Republic of Iran): This morning the Assembly heard a statement by the Foreign Minister of the United Arab Emirates. I regret that I have to reply, and I do so only to set the record straight. My country has endeavoured in earnest over the past several years to work out arrangements, in consultation and cooperation with the countries of the Persian Gulf region, to foster and consolidate security and solidity. We have affirmed, officially and on numerous occasions, the need to establish regional security and cooperation arrangements in the Persian Gulf based on the commitment of every State to the following principles: for sovereignty and territorial integrity; the unacceptability of claims on the territories of others; the inviolability of international borders; non-resort to force in the settlement of disputes; non- interference in the internal affairs of other States; respect for and and understandings; and dialogue and mutual understanding. compliance with agreements existing respect Members are fully aware that this morning my Minister in his statement before the expounded on this matter Assembly. In fact, he had presented a detailed plan to that effect to the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session, three years ago. Ever since, we have been very keen to contribute to the implementation of that plan. The second aspect I would like to address, although very briefly, concerns the crux of the matter: the differences between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Facts simply fail to corroborate the scenario presented by the Foreign Minister of the United Arab Emirates. It may not be that difficult to portray a nice, albeit self-serving, picture but it would be very difficult indeed to make a consistent case. The sequence of events as Forty-eighth session - 4 October l993 37 they really happened, and as things were, is quite different from the version of the United Arab Emirates. Since late in the summer of 1992, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has endeavoured in earnest and with sincerity to resolve the misunderstandings between the two countries that had arisen as regards Abu Musa island. Towards that end, and on the basis of the overall effort to which I have just referred, we entered into negotiations with the other party. The international community is well aware of the Iranian initiative late in September 1992 of sending a high-level delegation to Abu Dhabi for negotiations. In all honesty, the other party would reciprocate this approach and attitude. Much to our surprise, the United Arab Emirates party raised certain preconditions for the negotiations, which were totally unacceptable. This forced the bilateral talks to come to a halt at that stage. it was our hope that Moreover, ever since the end of the first round of negotiations in Abu Dhabi, the other party, which had anticipated the resumption of talks in Tehran, failed to do so. Instead, in pursuit of objectives inconsistent with the peaceful settlement of disputes, they resorted to other ways and means, such as the issuance in many places of repeated carbon-copy statements. The approach and behaviour of the United Arab Emirates over the past year, which seems to have been cheered on by a not-so-congruent consort of well-wishes from within and outside the region, make it crystal clear that they have not committed themselves to honest negotiations with the objective of resolving problems. Rather, they have tried by every means possible to keep the pending difficulty in a state of permanent limbo, pushing the situation periodically to centre stage in the Persian Gulf by rubber-stamp statements coming out of various Arab gatherings. It is indeed a matter of deep regret that the United Arab Emirates the misunderstanding between the two countries alive and simmering, a misjudgement which seems to have been prompted by expressions of support from other countries - which, in any case, are transient in nature. chose party to keep All through this process the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has publicly, as well as through diplomatic channels, expressed its readiness on numerous occasions to engage any preconditions, on all issues pending between the two countries. The official visit by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran to Abu Dhabi in May 1993 best In the joint illustrates the Iranian attitude. in and resume bilateral talks, without statement that was issued at the end of the two-day visit, the United Arab Emirates and Iran expressed their desire and readiness to engage in further talks to remove obstacles hindering discussions on issues pending between the two countries. The statement continued: \"This has to be implemented to achieve the hoped-for improvement in bilateral relations which will contribute positively to the security and stability of the region.\" After that latest Iranian initiative, in September 1993 of the United Arab Emirates Minister was supposed to reciprocate the visit, the details of which were to be discussed and finalized through normal diplomatic channels. The announcement in Abu Dhabi the forthcoming visit to Tehran was indeed a matter of surprise. Just two days prior to that announcement the Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates in Tehran had delivered a positive message from his Government to the Iranian Foreign Minister in which the date of the visit had been set. the cancellation of We were and continue to be fully prepared in Tehran to engage in frank and in-depth discussions with the United Arab Emirates delegation of all issues pending between the two sides. Of course - and let me be very clear - we were prepared to enter into negotiations without any preconditions. From the very beginning we have found unacceptable the setting by the United Arab Emirates of preconditions for negotiations, and it continues to be so. It is simply illogical and contrary to normal practice in inter-State relations for one party to an issue to make resumption of bilateral talks contingent upon acceptance by the other side of its conditions. I would like to say a word about the substance of the claim put forward by the United Arab Emirates. Without entering into any lengthy discussion of the true history of the islands in question, which is well known, I need only reiterate the legitimacy of the Iranian position with regard to its unassailable and indisputable sovereignty over the islands. Ample and solid historical evidence from antiquity to the present time corroborates our position. The fact that Iranian sovereignty over the islands in question was interrupted between 1904 and 1971 as a result of colonial ploys does not by any means change the status of those islands. What transpired in 1971 was no more than the reassertion of Irans sovereignty over the islands. While reiterating my Governments full commitment to the 1971 Memorandum of Understanding between Iran and Sharjah on the Abu-Musa island, I would take this opportunity to underline our full-fledged adherence to the 38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session for respect the sovereignty and territorial principle of integrity of other countries in the Persian Gulf. However, I would like to stress at the same time that it is incumbent upon all States to respect this principle. Moreover, allusion to subjective, self-serving and baseless historical claims over the territory of other States is, as the recent Persian Gulf crisis best illustrates, nothing but a dangerous political minefield with catastrophic consequences, a true Pandoras box that the international community would rather have not opened. Having said that, on behalf of my delegation I would like to reaffirm once again my Governments principled approach to our relations with the United Arab Emirates within the general framework of our policy towards the strategic Persian Gulf region, and to reconfirm our willingness and readiness to continue bilateral negotiations for the mutually beneficial resolution of issues pending between the two countries. For us in Iran, the imperative of the maintenance of security and tranquillity in the area is of paramount importance. We hope that our brothers in Abu Dhabi will reciprocate this spirit of good-neighbourly and brotherly relations, thus denying any opportunity to extraneous elements from within and outside the region to fan the flames on behalf of interests that are not those of the United Arab Emirates, Iran and the Persian Gulf. Mr. SAMHAN (United Arab Emirates) (interpretation from Arabic): The Iranian delegate has referred in his statement to the existing dispute between the United Arab Emirates and Iran over the three islands which belong to my country, namely Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa. On behalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates and in reply to the statement just made by the representative of Iran, I should like to emphasize the fact that my country rejects Irans military occupation of the three islands that it has done so since the beginning of 1971, and has condemned the measures taken by Iran which have resulted in the killing of many of the inhabitants of those islands who were nationals of the United Arab Emirates and who had remained on the Islands. We have already declared this position in the General Assembly, in the Security Council and in other United Nations bodies, as well as in other regional organs. We still consider the Iranian presence on the three islands merely as a military, unlawful occupation that contravenes the Charter of the United Nations, the rules of international law and the norms of good-neighbourliness. We have tried to settle the dispute by peaceful means through contacts between the two countries, but the Iranian side has persisted in its stance which rejects our claims. In particular it has refused any form of consideration of its military occupation of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa and has insisted on dealing with secondary questions that have nothing to do with the substance of the matter. Over the past two years, it has escalated the conflict by resorting to a number of unlawful measures and practices including the use of military force, against the nationals of the United Arab Emirates on the island of Abu Musa, in violation of the Memorandum of Understanding of 1971. Despite all that, my country wishes to declare once again its complete willingness to settle this dispute by any peaceful means stipulated by the Charter, so as to regain its sovereignty over the three islands, which are an integral part of our territory. This stance by the United Arab Emirates stems from its conviction that stability and security in the Gulf region necessitate cooperation and mutual respect for sovereignty by the countries of the region, non-interference in the internal affairs of others and the need to settle disputes by peaceful means, especially in the light of the new international and regional circumstances. Therefore, we appeal once again to the Islamic Republic of Iran to give a favourable reply to our call. Mr. IBANEZ FAJARDO (Cuba) (interpretation from It cannot be claimed that any atmosphere of Spanish): cordiality exists when criminal policies continue to be carried out in an attempt to starve my small country to death, solely because we have a dream of independence to which we hold fast and a plan for social justice that fits our own conditions. The powerful State to the North cannot dictate formulas to the Cuban people. Our history has taught us the lack of respect for our ideals shown by this gigantic neighbour, with its colonial yearnings and its tendentious manipulation of the media. Cuba is doing nothing more than demonstrating its willingness to have peaceful coexistence and international cooperation, and we only ask for respect for our struggles and for our dignity and patriotism"}}
