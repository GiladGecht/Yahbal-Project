{"speech":{"0":" I wish, on behalf of the Uganda delegation, to join those representatives who have already congratulated Mr. Insanally of Guyana on his well- deserved election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. His election to this high office is a tribute to his personal qualities and also an honour to Guyana, with which Uganda enjoys warm and friendly relations. Given his wide experience, and especially his intimate knowledge of I am confident that he will successfully guide its deliberations during the session. In this effort, he can count on Ugandas cooperation and support. the United Nations, I wish also to express the appreciation of my delegation to Mr. Insanallys predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, who presided with distinction at the forty-seventh session. Our appreciation goes, equally, to the distinguished Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has provided dynamic and courageous leadership to our Organization. He has come to grips with one of the biggest Forty-eighth session - 7 October l993 29 to the international community - conflict challenges resolution - and his incisive reports are an inspiration to us all. It is with happiness that, on behalf of the people and Government of Uganda, I express a warm welcome to the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Eritrea, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Monaco and Andorra as new Members of the United Nations. We look forward to working closely with them in our common efforts to fulfil the objectives and achieve the goals of the Organization. Allow me to convey to the people and Government of India Ugandas profound sympathy and solidarity following the tragic earthquake that struck that country last week, causing enormous destruction and massive loss of life. The ideological The dramatic end of the cold war created a wave of optimism. rivalry and the attendant confrontation between the major Powers yielded to understanding and cooperation, and the nightmare of the nuclear annihilation of the world receded - even if, in our minds, it was not totally eliminated. We believe that we are witnessing the dawn of a new era that promises the beginning of a new order based on peace, justice and equity - as envisaged in the United Nations Charter - both within and between nations. Whether we can succeed in attaining that lofty goal is one of the challenges of our time. Mr. Khan (Pakistan), Vice-President, took the Chair. the last However, the events of few years have tempered this sense of optimism. We see contradictory developments - some positive and others negative. On the one hand, there are positive developments in disarmament, the resolution of conflicts, and the emergence of democratic governance in many countries. But, on the other hand, we have witnessed the dangers of ethnic and religious intolerance, which have generated centrifugal forces in many parts of the world, often with debilitating tolls in human life, suffering and the destruction of property. I wish to caution against the danger of making purely ethnic and religious considerations the basis for forging a modern State. The challenge is to find democratic solutions for peaceful and equitable coexistence in a heterogeneous society. The divide between North and South, reflecting affluence on the one hand and widespread poverty and deprivation on the other, is widening. The same division between the haves and the have-nots is reflected within the deterioration of economic many nations. conditions if not adequately in developing countries, Clearly, The and security. such developments will pose a danger In the addressed, can only lead to despair and frustration. to long run, international peace international community should keep at the top of its agenda the urgent task of ensuring that the positive changes ushered in by the demise of the cold war equitably benefit all mankind. It is incumbent upon us to encourage and promote the positive trends while endeavouring to eliminate or minimize the negative aspects. Marginalization of developing countries cannot be in the interest of a better world. We should muster the will to face the political, economic, ecological and social challenges that stand in the way of the emancipation of the developing countries. At the last session of the General Assembly the Secretary-General showed the way forward in his \"An Agenda for Peace\", when he outlined his views on how the United Nations should carry out its task of maintaining international peace and security. He underscored the need for an early warning system for crisis situations and the need for timely preventive action, and he suggested peace-building measures that need to be taken. Uganda supported, and continues to support, the Secretary-Generals endeavour in this area. In our view, a critical pillar of conflict resolution, both at the international and the regional level, is the political will of the parties to the conflict and a commitment on their part to translate that will into practical actions. Where that will and commitment exist, solutions have been forthcoming, even to what were perceived as intractable problems. Another critical element in this regard is the capacity to enforce solutions where agreements exist. When a groups major consideration is military victory, contrary to the agreements reached, this may call for legitimate international intervention. I have in mind, for example, a number of agreements brokered between the parties by regional organizations or the United Nations which have then been deliberately scuttled for no legitimate reason. The situations in Yugoslavia, Somalia, Liberia and Angola are vivid reminders of the need for such a capacity. It is untenable that the international community should fail to act while senseless loss of life is perpetuated or chaos obtains in a country, as was the case in Somalia and Liberia. As many speakers have stated, sovereignty should not be used to hold a population hostage. A capacity to intervene in such situations should be in place. This is the question that we should ponder in the course of our deliberations, with a view to establishing parameters for such eventualities. 30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session In our continent, Africa, the contradictory positive and negative trends have also manifested themselves, both in the political arena and the economic sphere. In southern Africa, we are on the verge of achieving the goal the international community has always sought, namely, dismantling apartheid and putting in place a democratic and non-racial Government in South Africa. Here we have an example of political will and determination, and the capacity to translate that will into reality. Uganda welcomes the progress made in South Africa and the decision to establish the Transitional Executive Council (TEC), the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) and the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA). These are vital steps that should pave the way for free and fair elections next April, which should lead to the establishment of a transitional Government based on universal adult suffrage. We salute Mr. Nelson Mandela and other leaders of the liberation movements and President de Klerk for their vision and statesmanship, which have made this progress possible. the Organization of African Unity (OAU), With regard to the call to lift sanctions against South Africa in response to this progress, Ugandas approach has always been guided by the position of the people of South Africa, the Commonwealth and the United Nations. We are therefore supportive of the statement adopted on 29 September in New York by the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa, which recommends the lifting of all economic sanctions, with the exception of those relating to the arms embargo and nuclear matters, as recognition of the progress made thus far. We also agree with the Ad Hoc Committees call for vigilance until is established and for the establishment of full diplomatic relations following the installation of an elected interim Government of national unity. the Transitional Executive Council As regards Mozambique, Uganda welcomed the signing of a peace accord between the Government of Mozambique and RENAMO on 4 October 1992. We had hoped that by now all obstacles to the implementation of the accord would have been settled. Addressing the Assembly on 27 September, President Chissano, outlined the progress made in the revival of the countrys economic and social activity as a consequence of a cease-fire being effectively honoured. The deployment of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) provides an atmosphere conducive to implementing the provisions of the General Peace Agreement. We commend the Government of Mozambique for the flexibility and statesmanship they have demonstrated. We call on RENAMO to reciprocate equally and to comply with Security Council resolution 863 (1993), so that the people of Mozambique can embark on the important task of national reconstruction in an atmosphere of peace and stability. Uganda deeply regrets the resumption of hostilities in Angola, which clearly has negative consequences for the whole region. Remarkable progress had been made, culminating in the United Nations-supervised elections last year. Unfortunately, the hopes and aspirations of the people were dashed by the resumption of hostilities which interrupted the electoral process. The only way forward lies in national reconciliation and the acceptance of the rules of democratic governance. Uganda supports Security Council resolution 864 (1993), the implementation of which would pave way for a lasting solution. It is incumbent upon UNITA to abide by this resolution. installation of In our own region Uganda welcomes the agreement between the two parties, the Rwandese Government and the Rwandese Patriotic Front, on a process of national reconciliation and the a broad-based transitional government. Uganda, like other countries in the region, is ready and willing to support the Rwandese people in their endeavour to find a lasting settlement of their problems. This would also help foster stability and cooperation in our subregion. I wish to pay a tribute to President Ali Hassan Mwinyi and the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania, to the Organization of African Unity, and to all those who have been helping the parties to reach this accord. The United Nations has a critical role to play in the implementation of the Rwanda agreements. Both parties to the conflict requested the United Nations to provide a neutral force. We are happy to see that this request has received positive consideration by the Security Council. The Council has accepted the Secretary-Generals recommendation for the establishment of a neutral force known as the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). In the meantime, Uganda has agreed to the deployment on the Rwanda-Uganda border of the United Nations Observer Mission Uganda-Rwanda (UNOMUR) - as part and parcel of confidence-building measures - and stands ready to give additional support as and when requested. The conflict in southern Sudan continues to be of great concern to, and a source of anguish for, us in Uganda. The civil war has escalated rather than abated, resulting in loss of life, increased refugee flows, and the displacement of the population to neighbouring countries, Uganda included. We urge the parties to the conflict to cooperate in support of Forty-eighth session - 7 October l993 31 I wish regional efforts designed to find a lasting solution. also to appeal to the international community to continue providing humanitarian assistance and to be supportive of negotiations for a peaceful settlement. the Security Council The situation in Somalia is a vivid example of both natural and man-made disasters. Uganda welcomed the decision of in 1992 to provide humanitarian assistance to the Somali people and to restore order in Somalia. The United Nations operations helped to end massive starvation and brought hope to the people of Somalia. Uganda is also supportive of the second United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II), whose mandate is to provide an appropriate atmosphere for continued humanitarian assistance and for reconstruction and rehabilitation, and to facilitate an overall political settlement. from, let alone abdicate, We were encouraged by the Addis Ababa agreement of March this year whereby various Somali political forces agreed upon a programme of disarmament and reconciliation. It is sad that the situation in Somalia took a dramatic turn for the worse with the killing of members of the United Nations peace-keeping force. We regret the loss of life and attacks on the peace-keeping force. I wish to express our sincere condolences to the bereaved families and their respective Governments. It remains our conviction that these incidents, reprehensible as they are, should not lead the United Nations to divert its responsibilities towards the Somali people. Much has been achieved. Normalcy has been restored to much of the country, although chaos and armed resistance continue in a number of areas, especially in and around Mogadishu, where they imperil international efforts. We call on Somali political leaders to cooperate with the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD), the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United peace Nations and reconciliation transitional arrangements, including the establishment of a broad-based government. I wish to take this opportunity to commend United Nations personnel, the countries which have provided material and financial support, and the volunteers who have risked their lives in this worthy cause. achieving in motion aimed setting efforts and in at entrusted with the supervision and implementation of the Cotonou Agreement. We look forward to the full implementation of this accord. All this provides an example of the matching of the political will of the parties to the conflict to the capacity in the region to implement the agreed settlement. Equally, the Security Council decision to make it easier for the United Nations to supplement regional efforts in the search for agreements and in their implementation is most welcome. Apart from enhancing the regional capacity for peace-keeping, the Security Council decision helps to engender confidence. At the OAU Summit held in Cairo in July this year, African States agreed to set up, within the OAU, a mechanism for positive developments in Liberia and Rwanda, where the OAU and the pertinent leaders in the subregion have effectively discharged this role, are indicative of the potentialities of the regional mechanism. resolution. conflict The In the Middle East, the mutual recognition between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel, together with the agreements signed between them, constitute a breakthrough of historic proportions. This is yet another illustration of the dictum that where there is a will, vision and statesmanship, a way forward will be found. This development holds the promise for concord and cooperation in the Middle East region as a whole. We welcome the Declaration of Principles on Palestinian interim self-rule in the occupied territories. These arrangements, which envisage a five-year transition period, are an important step towards in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We commend Chairman Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin for the courage and statesmanship they have displayed. We encourage all of them to persevere in the task ahead and on the journey they have begun. I wish also to express Ugandas appreciation to Norway, the United States, those who were instrumental in the reaching of this historic accord. the Russian Federation, and all and lasting settlement comprehensive a As regards the situation in Liberia, Uganda supports the initiative of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for the settlement of the crisis. We welcomed the Cotonou Agreement signed on 25 July 1993, which provides for a cease-fire and for the transitional arrangement leading to elections early next year. The ECOWAS Miliary Observer Group (ECOMOG) has clearly been a stabilizing force in Liberia. That is why it has been It Three years have elapsed since the outbreak of the Gulf crisis. We are glad that the sovereignty of Kuwait was restored. remains our hope that, with positive developments elsewhere in the region, it will be possible for the people in the Gulf to be reconciled and to solve the outstanding problems so that harmony and cooperation can things, be re-established. This requires, among other 32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session compliance with Security Council resolutions relating to the Gulf War settlement. Uganda supports the efforts by the Secretary-General to ensure an overall settlement of the Cyprus problem. Any settlement, while taking into account the legitimate interests of the parties, should safeguard the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Cyprus. As regards the Korean peninsula, Uganda supports the aspiration of the Korean people to peaceful reunification. We encourage them to continue their dialogue towards this objective. (UNTAC) in Cambodia In Cambodia we have just witnessed the fruitful completion of the peace process in accordance with the Paris Agreements. Under the auspices of the United Nations Transitional Authority the Cambodian people have been able to exercise their right to vote and to decide on their own Government in the general elections for a constituent assembly. We are happy to see that a new democratic Constitution, with a constitutional monarchy has been peacefully promulgated. I wish to express the gratitude of the Uganda delegation to the Secretary-General and the UNTAC personnel who, under the able leadership of Mr. Yasushi Akashi, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, have contributed towards a comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian question. Our appreciation goes equally to Viet Nam, France, Australia, China, the United States of America and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which, at different stages, contributed to the peace process. It is to us a matter of deep regret that in the former Yugoslavia, instability, strife and war based on ethnic and religious differences continue unabated. In pursuit of the reprehensible notion of \"ethnic cleansing\", atrocities are being committed. In spite of the grave situation, it has not been possible for the Security Council and the international community to act decisively to put an end to the agony and suffering there. The injunctions of the Security Council continue to be flouted with impunity. We reject and condemn the notion of \"ethnic cleansing\". I wish, however, to commend the United Nations Protection Force for the efforts it has made under the most difficult of conditions. On disarmament, Uganda is encouraged by the progress achieved in the wake of the demise of the cold war. The United States and the Russian Federation under START II have significantly reduced their nuclear arsenals. We were encouraged by the decision of the United States to extend the moratorium on nuclear tests until 1994, by the declaration of Russia not to resume testing even if others did, and by Frances commitment not to be the first to resume. In spite of the recent set-backs, we hope that this moratorium will hold. Uganda, however, believes that a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty is the ultimate solution. As a State party to the non-proliferation Treaty, we shall continue to participate actively in the preparatory process leading to the 1995 Review Conference. We support the extension of the Treaty, subject to periodic reviews. We shall also seek to remove the imbalances in the present Treaty and to secure increased assistance for developing countries in the area of the peaceful application of nuclear energy. We maintain that there exists an intrinsic relationship between the disarmament process and development. Developing countries paid a heavy price during the height of the cold war as world attention was focused on acquiring additional armaments under the doctrines of deterrence. Many of them were trapped in civil conflict arising from ideological wars. As the resources devoted to building armaments are released in the disarmament process, these should be applied for development both within and between nations. Unfortunately, at the international level, we have yet to see the peace dividend being channelled towards assistance to developing countries. At the national level, Uganda, after the restoration of peace in the country, has now embarked on a process of scaling down its army to a level which the economy can sustain and which at the same time meets our legitimate defence needs. This is a bold decision by the Government, in the long run, should release resources for which, development purposes. I wish here to express our appreciation to those countries and organizations which have agreed to assist us in the resettlement and integration of demobilized soldiers within the civilian community. in Vienna. That Conference This session is taking place in the aftermath of the momentous World Conference on Human Rights that took place reaffirmed the commitment of the international community to try to secure the full and universal enjoyment of human rights. We hope that as a result there will be increased awareness in the world of the importance of human rights and a determination to build the requisite capacity at the national and local levels to ensure their enforcement. Linked with the human rights issue is the question of democratic governance and the rule of law. Democratic governance promotes human rights. In Uganda, as part of the restoration of democratic civilian rule, the Constitutional Forty-eighth session - 7 October l993 33 Commission has already produced a draft constitution. The election of a Constituent Assembly, which is to deliberate and agree on the Constitution, will be held in December this year or early next year. Whether or anywhere else, it in Africa the democratization process may be difficult, but is an essential ingredient for peace, stability, the rule of law, and the full respect and enjoyment of human rights. This is particularly urgent in developing countries, in Africa in particular. They are essential aspects and conditions of the development process. We must therefore bring our full energies to bear so that the democratization process may gain momentum. One of the major objectives of the United Nations, enshrined in the Charter, is the promotion of economic and social progress. In our quest for peace, it is imperative to address the economic and social challenges, which, too often, are the fundamental causes of conflicts in many regions. The present world economic situation is very grim. There has been a prolonged recession in the developed countries which, in turn, has had a negative effect on the world economic situation. This has been devastating for the developing countries, which have had to labour in a harsh international environment. The crippling external debt is one of the major obstacles for developing countries. In Uganda, for example, it is estimated that we shall spend about 60 per cent of our projected export receipts on debt servicing. The debt problem has been exacerbated by the unfavourable terms of trade, especially the collapse of the prices of commodities, which are the mainstay of our economies. Coupled with the reduction of resource flows, this has hampered our development. Yet, while still experiencing these conditions, our countries have undertaken structural adjustment reforms which call for heavy sacrifices on the part of the population, especially the very vulnerable people. For these programmes to achieve the desired objectives of sustained growth, it is imperative that further measures on debt relief, including debt cancellation, be put in place, more so in respect of sub-Saharan African countries. There is also an urgent need to increase significantly the volume of resource flows in support of development efforts in these countries. We look forward to the urgent and balanced conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. We are hopeful that a successful conclusion of these negotiations would increase world trade and increase the access of our products to world markets. This should help to increase our export earnings. Regrettably, for Africa the critical economic situation and the trend of marginalization continue. It is crucial to arrest and reverse this trend if Africa is to succeed or even survive in the geopolitical and economic system of the twenty-first century. We need to enlarge our economic space. integration is an imperative if Africa is to end its underdevelopment and to be integrated into the global economy. Forging regional African integration will create economies of scale, which are essential for the diversification of the African economies, making full use of Africas natural resources, increasing self-sufficiency and strengthening the continents position within the global economy. It is precisely for this reason that the Organization of African Unity adopted the Abuja Treaty creating an African Economic Community. the strengthening of The Treaty stipulates, inter alia, subregional economic groupings. In this regard, the countries of the Eastern and Southern Africa Preferential Trade Area have resolved to establish a subregional common market. A treaty to this effect will be signed in Kampala, Uganda, on 4 November this year. We appeal to the regional international community to be supportive of integration by providing assistance to put in place the necessary infrastructures. The Rio Earth summit was an important milestone on the road to forging a global consensus on sustainable development. Uganda welcomes the adoption of Agenda 21, which spelled out measures to be adopted by the international community. As a follow-up, Uganda has drawn up a National Environment Action Plan to address our environmental problems. We welcome the establishment of the Commission on Sustainable Development and of the Negotiating Committee for an international convention on drought and desertification, in line with the wishes of African countries. In spite of the progress made, we notice a reluctance on the part of the donor community as regards fulfilling the commitments agreed upon in Rio. This is especially true with regard to providing new and additional resources. I wish to stress that for us in Uganda the cause of environmental degradation is poverty. Forests, for example, are being depleted daily because the people use their trees as a source of energy. To reverse this trend we need capital to exploit hydro-electric power or solar energy, both of which we have aplenty. We urge the international community to appreciate this problem. As regards reform of the United Nations, we maintain our position that we shall support those measures which 34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session improve efficiency and which do not distort the priorities that have been agreed on, and which reflect the interests of all Member States. We are also supportive of the proposals for the enlargement of the Security Council to reflect present-day realities. We reaffirm that an important criterion to take into account is that a country, big or small, seeking membership of the Security Council must fully embrace, and be seen to act in accordance with, the underlying values of the United Nations mandate for peace, respect for human rights, democratization and other accepted international norms. It is also important that the composition of all United Nations organs accord with the principles of the Charter, notably the principle of sovereign equality of nations and the principle of democracy. It is with this in mind that we shall examine all proposals for restructuring that are before us. We stand at a historic watershed on account of contradictory trends which characterize the current transition to a new world order yet to be shaped and defined. We have, one hopes, a unique opportunity to construct a firm foundation for the edifice of a future in which the interests of all of us can be adequately catered for. Mr. ABU SALIH (Sudan): Allow me at the outset to express to Ambassador Insanally my special congratulations on his election to preside over the General Assembly at this important session. He represents Guyana, an active member of the Non-Aligned Movement, of which Sudan is proud to be a founding member. May I also extend our thanks and appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev for the skilful and efficient manner in which he conducted the work of the previous session. that those attained especially The United Nations represents hope for all nations and nascent States, their independence through long struggle. It is a great honour and pleasure for me to welcome our sister country, Eritrea, which has joined the membership of the United Nations. Our two peoples continue to enjoy mutual respect and esteem, and our Governments are endeavouring to foster fraternal relations with a view to achieving prosperity for the brotherly peoples of the two countries, and for the whole region. Allow me also to salute the Czech Republic, Slovakia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Monaco and Andorra, which joined the United Nations as part of a new momentum contributing to human endeavours to achieve stability, prosperity and peace for the world. I a l s o s a l u t e S e c r e t a r y - G e n e r a l , Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who is leading the Secretariat of the United Nations at a crucial stage as it faces many challenges and pressures. t h e The Sudan learned with grief and sadness of the tragic loss of life in the earthquake which struck parts of India. I extend the deepest sympathy of the Sudan to friendly India along with heartfelt condolences to the families of those who lost their lives. Since the previous session, important events have emerged in the international arena. We are now witnessing accelerated political and social change unprecedented in history. New international situations and changes occur every day; we are all trying to keep up with them. Today, we are experiencing a phase of travail and transition, which results every day in new, divergent patterns. The most striking of those patterns is the widening of the gap between the rich North and the less privileged South. The trend in todays world is towards the machinery of regional groupings. This reflects the fact that the world has already started to be more inclined to think in a more collective manner. We hope that this new pattern will be positive and constructive, giving due respect to the charters and covenants that are binding on all. We seriously assert that developing countries are no longer principal partners in most of the resolutions that are adopted, particularly within the framework of the Security Council and other United Nations organs. Had developing countries been allowed equitable participation, their contribution could have been more effective in the course of many of these important events, specially in the field of regional and international peace and security. Four years ago we started reviewing the functions of the United Nations and its various organs. We must place on record, from this rostrum, our conviction that this Organization has a basic role to play in the maintenance of international peace and security and the achievement of prosperity for mankind. For the United Nations fully to perform such a vital role, its governing Charter must be fully respected. The Charter must also be adhered to by all, and must be updated to keep pace with the developments that have occurred since its adoption. The General Assembly too should be enabled fully to perform its functions for the maintenance of peace and security. The General Assembly should be given its due importance, equal and parallel to that of the Security Council. Forty-eighth session - 7 October l993 35 Selectivity in implementing the provisions of the Charter must be abandoned. In this regard, we firmly stress that the activities of the Security Council must be transparent and that the Council should adopt a democratic approach in its decisions. It is thus inevitable that the question of the Councils permanent membership, and the right of veto, which enables a few States to invalidate the opinion of the majority, be reviewed, especially at a time when the United Nations is advocating the values of democracy, participation, justice and equality. for The United Nations and one of its organs, the Security Council, are currently engaged in serious and active attempts to settle disputes based on new prospects the establishment of regional and international peace and security. Let us pause here for a moment. We all aspire to save the world from the calamities of war and the destructive consequences of the prevailing social and economic situation. Yet, at the same time, we reject double standards in the resolutions of the Security Council, especially in relation to international peace and security. We are anxious lest the United Nations lose its proper vision in the heat of events. The nature of the responsibilities and duties of the Organization requires strict neutrality. International peace and security is a principle that must apply to all. But to see the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina suffer to the brink of elimination because of the shaky and defective resolutions of the Security Council is a situation that should not be allowed to pass unnoticed. Similarly, the Somali people cannot be allowed to remain victims of irregularities committed by the international forces there because of the departure from their binding original mandate. This is a matter that requires both change and a strict and immediate investigation. We are still witnessing the deterioration of the security situation in Somalia owing to the continuing fighting between the international forces and some of the Somali factions, as well as with individuals. This has resulted in many killings and has caused the international forces to stray from their original mandate. We have previously expressed our reservations with regard to the hasty use of international forces in Somalia without consulting the States of the region or exhausting the efforts and endeavours being exerted by those States to find a solution to the Somali crisis. We are concerned that the continuation of fighting between the international forces and some of the Somali factions will shed more blood, complicate the problem and render it insoluble by the United Nations. Therefore, we request the United Nations and the forces that are supposed to operate under its banner to refrain from continuing the type of actions that would provoke the Somali people and the countrys factions or affect the structure of their political future, values and cultural and religious heritage. We also deem it fitting that the Permanent Committee on Somalia of the States of The Horn of Africa be given the necessary time to perform its pioneering function of finding a solution to the Somali crisis. These States are better acquainted with the nature and dimension of the problem by virtue of their special relations with Somalia and its people. independence or We will support new international arrangements that will ensure the enhancement of the performance of the Organization and establish justice and tranquillity among all. The arrangements we are hoping for shall not infringe upon the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States or meddle with their right of decision-making. Preventive diplomacy, associated with peacemaking and peace-keeping, should be motivated by a basic goal, namely, the elimination of regional and international tension. This could be achieved by defining the causes of political and social conflicts in order to eliminate them so that different societies might enjoy stability, well-being, and peace. Preventive diplomacy and the subsequent use of political and military force cannot be applied solely against less privileged countries and vulnerable peoples. In brief, we are hoping for a new formula within the framework of current international arrangements to guarantee the rights of all and to save the world from the hegemony of the stronger over the less privileged. We also aspire to a greater role for the regional organizations of the developing countries and to their representation in the important forum of the Security Council, which is entrusted with the task of maintaining peace and security all over the world. Along with this understanding of the new role of the United Nations in protecting and preserving the rights of States, we call for the lifting of the economic embargo imposed on Iraq. The Iraqi people have suffered for an extended period of time from the unfair embargo that is still imposed on them, despite the exhaustion of the reasons that invoked it. Another example of the misuse of this international Organization is the embargo imposed on Libya without any legal and justified cause to permit the actions taken against that country. Libya has already responded to Security Council resolution 731 (1992) and shown sufficient flexibility to settle its differences with the Western States, a matter that would justify the lifting of the embargo imposed on it. 36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session The agenda items before this session include important issues reflecting the accelerated pace of events I mentioned at the beginning of my statement. However, I prefer to be direct in touching upon issues of immediate concern to us in the Sudan because of the misunderstanding that has accompanied them. adamantly reject policies that reflect a double standard in dealing with human rights, because the Sudan has been victimized by such policies. We also hope that universality of human rights will not be construed to justify denial of the cultural, religious and indigenous specifics of various States and peoples. During the forty-eighth session of the Human Rights Commission, held at Geneva in March 1992, and upon a motion by the United States representative, the Commission adopted a resolution appointing an independent expert assigned to investigate the human-rights situation in the Sudan and to submit a report to the forty-ninth session of the Commission in March-April 1993. The States sponsoring that resolution did not wish to wait for the report of the independent expert but pushed the matter to the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly, where a resolution on the alleged human-rights violations in the Sudan was adopted. The sponsoring States used all the influence, pressure and the mechanical majority they possessed to see that that politically motivated resolution was adopted. Those who pose as defenders of human rights in the ignore the terrorist practices of the outlaws in Sudan southern Sudan lead by John Garang. They have opted to keep silent with respect to the atrocities he has committed, atrocities such as the abduction and recruitment of children for military operations, the regular killing of civilian populations, the downing of civilian aircraft and the kidnapping and killing of United Nations staff working in relief operations. They have also kept silent with regard to his continued obstruction of all serious peacemaking endeavours initiated inside or outside the Sudan. Not only that, they have received him as a top official dignitary and extended to him every moral support, despite his gross violation of human rights. expert praised cooperation In his report in the Sudan or to the forty-ninth session of in March 1993, of the the Commission on Human Rights independent the the Government of the Sudan and explained that he had had neither the time nor the opportunity to judge the situation of human rights to study the matter comprehensively. He indicated that the Commission might wish to extend his mission in order to allow him to complete his mandate. While we do not conceive of any justifiable reasons behind his appointment, the Government of the Sudan nevertheless extended every possible cooperation to the Special Rapporteur, who visited the Sudan last week and will submit his report. Respect for and maintenance of human rights represent one of the sacred principles that are enshrined in all divine religions as well as in man-made laws. The Sudan, inspired by its cultural and civilized heritage, pays due attention to the issues of human rights. The Sudanese Government and society respect and observe the human-rights values based on their religious belief and traditions. Accordingly, we reject any politicization or manipulation of such a sacred doctrine as a pretext for meddling in the internal affairs of States or for imposing a specific cultural trend or option of civilization on any State. For the same reason, we are of the view that developmental assistance should not be tied to a distorted human-rights record. The right to development itself represents an inalienable human right. We also opt for equality and fairness in assessing or monitoring the performance of States in the field of human rights. We In this connection we view General Assembly resolution as a biased resolution that has contributed to the intransigence of the Garang movement and motivated it to reject all Government endeavours to achieve a peaceful settlement through negotiations. We are also convinced that that resolution lacks any substantive justification, and we stand ready to provide all the factual information on the human-rights situation in the Sudan to all who are interested. Those who accuse the Government of the Sudan of violating the human rights of its own citizens have also ignored the giant achievements of the Government, such as adopting the conferences system along the lines of Shura and organizing the national conferences to determine the structure of the political system in order to lay down the basic foundations of national unity and to look for ways and means to achieve a real peace guaranteeing fundamental political, social, cultural and religious rights for all citizens. As a result, a National Transitional Assembly was established as the supreme legislative organ of the country, pending completion of the political structures at both the federal and the state level and the conduct of the presidential elections to be held in the country at a subsequent stage. Many must have learned of the recent decision of the United States Government to add the Sudan to its own classification of countries allegedly sponsoring terrorism. While the United States Government is free to take whatever decision it deems appropriate, we have the right to question the facts and findings on which the United States Forty-eighth session - 7 October l993 37 it has enabled the United Nations However, Sudan has a bright and outstanding record in this area. Operation Lifeline Sudan is an unprecedented initiative; and non-governmental organizations to provide relief supplies to affected populations, whoever and wherever they are. Since the forty-seventh session, continuous efforts have been made to strengthen the efficiency of Operation Lifeline and its relief programme, such as the signing of an agreement between the Government of the Sudan, the United Nations and the rebel factions in December 1992 to secure the flow of relief to all areas in need. In January 1993, another agreement was signed between the Government of the Sudan, the United Nations and the non-governmental organizations to facilitate and enhance the role of the non- governmental organizations in relief and rehabilitation. In March 1993, the Sudan signed a memorandum of understanding with the International Committee of the Red Cross to streamline the cooperation between the Government and the Committee and to strengthen the effectiveness of its operations in southern Sudan. The allocation of 153,000 metric tons of grain by the Government to the World Food Programme to be distributed to the population in need represents a cornerstone of our contribution to relief efforts. the Government of Government has based its decision. While the United States has the right to enact domestic decisions, the utilization of such decisions as a prelude to further actions beyond its territories contradicts international law and the United Nations Charter. We cannot understand how a super-Power which enjoys permanent membership in the Security Council can enact domestic legislation to justify the pursuit of its private interests in the territories of other countries. Such instances are numerous, the most recent of which was the search in the port of Djibouti of a vessel freighting sugar en route to sisterly Somalia. It is our conviction that the motive behind the media campaign against the Sudan is the alienation of Sudan from its African and Arab affiliations and the smearing of its image by erroneously labelling its civilization as terrorist. This media campaign constitutes a prelude to a siege on Sudan similar to what has happened to some other countries. We are known to all as a peaceful nation; we denounce terrorism in all its forms. Accordingly, the decision lacks the necessary legal support, contravenes justice and good conscience and clearly exceeds the role of the United Nations. As proof of our assertion, it could not generate any support. Former President Jimmy Carter and a number of credible institutions and newspapers have expressed their scepticism and criticism regarding its ethical value. Likewise, the Sudanese peoples have demonstrated their rejection and denunciation of that decision. Real terrorism is when a single super-Power uses it as a pretext and utilizes its might to terrorize small developing countries for no reason except that they opted for a path of independent decision-making and rejected blind proselytism, or merely for their different views. Mixing politics with humanitarian assistance is rather risky, especially in relief work, which is a sensitive matter, as it directly affects human survival through supplying basic needs such as food and medicine. This necessitates the absolute neutrality of the relief donors. Recent years have witnessed an increasing involvement of politics in humanitarian work, which fact led Mr. Cornelio Sommaruga, President of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to explicitly warn against the danger of mixing politics with humanitarian work. Sudan has suffered tremendously from these attempts to tarnish its image by intentionally distorting its achievements in relief delivery so that they are seen as failures, its initiatives depicted as obstructions and its cooperation as impediment of the inflow of relief supplies. The reality is that we feel we are unjustly treated by some States and some media that tend to undermine our efforts in relief operation and blemish our reputation. The mission of Mr. Vieri Traxler, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs for the Sudan, and its positive outcome, stand as another example of the cooperation of the Government of the Sudan with the international community. A number of modalities were agreed upon during that mission to guarantee the full implementation of all previously signed agreements. It is my pleasure to convey to this Assembly that during Mr. Traxlers mission to the Sudan a number of steps were taken to implement what was agreed upon. On the initiative of the Government of the Sudan, an agreement was reached to send joint assessment missions, constituted by the United Nations and the non-governmental organizations working in relief operations, to about 30 safe locations in the three Southern States, the Nuba mountains and Kordofan. It was also agreed that the town of Malakal and its environs would be considered a model of relief integrated programmes to be implemented in other areas after proving successful. This is in addition to other steps oriented towards strengthening the efficiency of operations and ensuring relief for those in need wherever they may be. Allow me to acquaint this Assembly with the achievements of the Government of Sudan in political, economic and social fields. The priority item on my Governments agenda is to attain a just and lasting peace in southern Sudan and to put an end to the war that horrified 38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session programme for the implementation of far-reaching reforms in the structure of the Sudanese economy by engaging in a free-market policy, diminishing the role of the Government in trade and economic activities, and giving the private sector its due catalytic role in these activities. innocent civilians and devastated their lives, the war that exposed them to the scourges of death, famine, disease and displacement. This war, which was the by-product of the colonial conspiracy, has turned the citizens into recipients of relief and made them dependent on others. It constitutes a perpetual squandering of vast resources that could have been utilized in economic and social development and for the welfare of the Sudanese peoples in the south and the north. rebels without preconditions. Faithful to its earnest endeavours to bring about a peaceful settlement of the discord in the south, the Sudanese Government has emphasized since 1989 its readiness to talk peace with the The Government put forward a comprehensive framework for peace emanating from the recommendations of a national conference. This approach is based on remedying the lingering causes of the conflict in the areas of power- and wealth-sharing, relations between religion and State, adoption of the federal system of government to meet the aspirations of different regions for a genuine sharing of power, the exemption of the south from the application of Sharia laws and the redistribution and reallocation of resources for social and economic development on equitable grounds. In this positive spirit the Government held several rounds of negotiations with the rebel movement. The last meeting took place in Abuja with the mediation of sisterly Nigeria. The Government, out of its keen desire to bring the peace talks to a successful conclusion, showed great flexibility, but it realized, unfortunately, that, owing to the pressures of foreign interests, Garangs faction was not the master of its decision. That was why we could not reach an agreement in order to alleviate the suffering of our citizens in the south. The failure of the second Abuja peace talks did not, however, weaken the determination of the Government to continue searching for peace through negotiations. To this end, the Government started a new round of negotiations, this time in Sudanese territory, with the other united rebel factions. The Government also accepted a quadrilateral peace initiative put forward by four Heads of State members of the Intergovernmental Authority for Drought and Development (IGADD): Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea. We believe that neighbouring countries are able and keen to help in resolving this stalemate. Furthermore, the Government accepted the initiative of former President Jimmy Carter in mediating between the Government and the rebel factions. In the area of economic development, the Government of the Sudan adopted an ambitious three-year economic Forty-eighth session - 7 October l993 39 Economic and monetary regulations were enacted to encourage investment, especially in agriculture and animal products. This economic programme reaped its fruits, and we have registered an increase of over 10 per cent in the rate of growth of the gross national product, as well as self- sufficiency in grain and sugar. This programme energized the economy and led to the inflow of foreign investment, owing to the free-market policy, the infrastructure and the building up of the capacity of human resources. the reform of All these developments could have achieved positive results, not for the benefit of the Sudanese people alone, but also for the African and Arab regions, had they not been forestalled by political machinations in areas of international trade and economic cooperation, as well as interference in the work of the international monetary institutions. An unjust and undeclared economic embargo deprived the Sudan of development resources from bilateral and multilateral institutions. This unjust behaviour deprived the people of the Sudan of their right to development, a right enshrined in all international conventions. In the social field, the Government is very attentive to the needs of the impoverished sector of the population. Financial support is increasingly extended to them through Zakat funds and social-welfare institutions. A number of commercial subsidies were introduced to alleviate the economic burden of a broad sector of the population. Salaries in the public and private sectors were increased and subjected to continuous revision. All this was done in full compliance with and respect for human dignity, and to eliminate poverty. Moreover, in the area of legislation, the Government excluded the States with non-Muslim majorities from being subjected to Sharia laws. In the area of human rights, a Supreme Council for Human Rights was established, under the chairmanship of the second-highest ranking official in the State. Security prevails throughout the country, the rule of law has replaced chaos, and there have been other great accomplishments in the fields of education, literacy, health, environment, and the improvement of the living conditions relocation to ensure a of displaced persons and their dignified life while they await the elimination of the conditions that forced them to become displaced persons. The position of Sudan has remained clear ever since the commencement of the Arab-Israeli peace talks: we believe its 100th meeting in Cairo, that they should lead to the exercise of Arab and Palestinian rights based on the provisions of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978). Since the signing of the Declaration of Principles of self-autonomy between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel, the Middle East and the Palestinians cause have The Arab League Council of entered a new phase. Ministers, after issued a communique on this agreement based on Security Council resolutions. The communique emphasized the necessity of an Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon so as to open a new page in the history of the Middle East and enable the people of the region to work for development and prosperity. The Arab League Council considered the agreement a step forward towards the establishment of a comprehensive peace in the region, provided that other steps to complement it were guaranteed such as a complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, the West Bank, including Jerusalem, and the territory in southern Lebanon. to consolidate The Arab world has articulated its judgement on this historic agreement and proved its sincerity about desiring a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement in the region. At this critical point in time, we appeal to our Palestinian brothers their unity and unify their determinant objectives. They should close the doors against any attempts to divide them. The United Nations is called upon to supervise this peace plan by insisting on the implementation of all its resolutions based on international legitimacy. The custodians of this peace plan are also called upon to ensure an expeditious Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories, in full compliance with the relevant United Nations resolutions. The positive developments taking place in South Africa as a result of the struggle of our brothers and sisters there in their quest for emancipation, equality and the rule of the majority stand as proof of the important role the United Nations can play in accordance with the principles of the Charter whenever a Member State shows the necessary political will. My delegation associates itself with the leader Nelson Mandela international Organization to secure the transitional arrangements leading to the emergence of a democratic, unified and non-racial South Africa. call upon the in his As an African country, we believe that Africa has demonstrated throughout history its unique ability to resolve African disputes through African mediation. In this regard, the I salute the Organization of African Unity (OAU), 40 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Desertification (IGADD), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and all other African subregional organizations, as well as various African States that have played leading roles in the peaceful settlement of several disputes in such countries as Rwanda and Liberia, thus contributing to peace and stability in Africa. We hope that peace will soon prevail in Angola, Mozambique and Somalia so that Africa can enjoy the stability that will enable it to meet the challenges of construction and development and move towards prosperity for the African people and people of the whole world"}}
