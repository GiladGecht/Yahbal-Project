{"speech":{"0":" I would be disloyal to the feelings of the delegation of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea if I did not from the outset join with the preceding speakers in expressing my best wishes to you and congratulating you on your well-deserved election to the Presidency of this General Assembly. I wish you every success and assure you of the complete cooperation of my delegation. Please convey my congratulations also to the other members of the General Committee, whose work is not always given due recognition. We also commend the work accomplished by Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana, who presided over the last session of the General Assembly. And I wish to express appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our distinguished Secretary- General, for his deep commitment to the search for viable solutions to the problems and difficulties confronting mankind today. special 14 It is illogical and inconceivable to the peoples of our world that after the fall of the ideological borders that shaped the bipolar world, we should again be confronted with new burdens and contradictions. My country is deeply concerned at the negative effect of the wave of violence in many parts of the world today. In record time, we have seen evidence of many sources of tension and conflicts that wipe out many years of United Nations efforts. Everywhere panic and uncertainty prevail, owing to the intolerance and arbitrariness that are real threats to world peace. None the less, it would seem that we all want to close our eyes and act as though we did not know For the Republic of the causes of this instability. interdependent: Equatorial Guinea, poverty, inequality nations, unemployment, ignorance, and political and religious intolerance. the causes are all relations among in This forty-ninth session of our General Assembly must therefore reflect deeply in order to find a global solution to these common denominators of all our countries. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea wishes to reaffirm here, from this rostrum, the confidence that it has placed in the United Nations and our conviction that this Organization is the ideal framework for resolving the difficult, delicate and complex problems confronting the international community. In this grim international panorama, my country, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, is endeavouring to preserve internal peace and political stability, and to maintain a strict policy of good-neighbourliness and cooperation with the other countries of central Africa. In this framework, we have been strengthening the internal socio-political that make it possible to coordinate an integral, democratic system that guarantees the individual and collective freedoms of our citizens. Indeed in 1991, the Government began a transition on the basis of established constitutional provisions and has been establishing the political environment conducive to political pluralism and a multiparty system. A number of structures General Assembly Forty-ninth session legal regulations now govern the exercise of pluralist democracy in my country. May I mention, among them: the law of political parties, freedom of association and expression, our trade union law, the law of freedom of the press and printed matter, the law of freedom of religion, the law of complaints and petitions, and all the other laws that govern the electoral process. the law of Therefore, the fact is that Equatorial Guinea today is a free, democratic and independent country where peace and stability prevail. With only 400,000 inhabitants, we have 14 political organizations that operate freely and democratically and constitute the pluralist expression of our peoples. None the less, as everyone knows, there are some who, because of their concealed interests, have attempted, and continue to attempt, to thwart the will of some of our political leaders in our democratic process. This is the root cause of the disinformation campaign that is being waged against my country. the President of Allow me to dwell a moment on this point. Because my country is being subjected to a systematic international campaign of disinformation through certain very well- localized media. Hence a negative image is being projected of my country, in total disregard of the efforts that have been made since 1979 by His Excellency Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, to restore the respectability and honour of my country after 11 long, bloody years of the dictatorship of Macias Nguema, who was overthrown without anyone helping us. Regarding this campaign of disinformation, there is a saying that I would like to reiterate here: “The truth is one, but untruth is manifold”. Everything depends on the colour of the lens through which one looks. There are some who, because of their own unconfessed interests prefer to continue to look at us through a dark lens; but we ask the international community to assess our actions in a neutral and objective way, without allowing itself to be influenced by third parties. We ask that you view us through a clear lens that will allow you to see the reality. Please do not misunderstand me. We are not against the contribution of the international community to the efforts of the people and Government of Equatorial Guinea for democracy and the promotion of human rights and freedoms, but we do believe that these objectives cannot be achieved by promoting and instigating ungovernability, anarchy and civil disobedience in the developing countries. We see some countries now using the international communitys demand for respect for human rights and 25th meeting 10 October 1994 are that aimed at democracy to mask activities subjugating developing countries such as Equatorial Guinea. None the less, we would like to point out that in the course of this year, certain donors, such as France and Spain and the United Nations Development Programme, have made a positive contribution to our democratic process by giving moral, technical and economic support to our efforts to consolidate democracy. They have done excellent work. in a We believe that the escalation of domestic tensions in many African countries today has a common cause: political intolerance, fuelled and promoted by foreign intervention jurisdiction. However, as the saying goes, “The masters eye makes the horse fat” — in other words, however they may be assessed or distorted from outside, the realities in each of the countries in those regions exist independently of the interpretations placed on them. country's domestic We in Equatorial Guinea believe that development and democracy can be promoted only in an atmosphere of peace. We therefore feel that the United Nations should put emphasis on its efforts at preventive action rather than those designed to restore peace or serve as a buffer. Measures such as the dispatch of evaluation or inquiry missions to individual countries can be more effective in avoiding conflicts like those currently taking place in such fraternal and friendly countries as Angola, Rwanda, Liberia, Somalia, the former Yugoslavia and so on. Interventions after the fact have been shown to have limited effectiveness. Some peace-keeping missions and operations in certain conflict areas have also undergone a qualitative change. It is therefore urgent to redirect the mechanisms through which the Organization functions and adapt them to the changes in today's world. We believe that in an increasingly complicated world, and with limited resources, international relations In this sphere the role of the must be complementary. United Nations has become even more decisive. It is hardly useful for some to attempt to monopolize the solution to the world's problems if we do not all feel sincerely involved. As an earlier speaker in the general debate noted, there can be neither peace nor justice if discrimination exists in international relations. My country hopes that the new world scene will witness the implementation of procedures for sincere international cooperation on behalf of those countries that 15 General Assembly Forty-ninth session 25th meeting 10 October 1994 need it most, those countries that are struggling not just to maintain the quality of life but often for their very survival. The poverty and misery in all the countries on Earth calls for action by others to remedy their plight. receiving from international agencies, we shall spare no effort to control it effectively. From this rostrum we are appealing to the international community to join us in our efforts to speed and support work in these sectors. efforts United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security contrast with the limited progress achieved in economic and social development. The global chasm separating rich and poor is steadily widening. We need the solidarity of the industrialized countries, on mutually agreed terms, if we developing countries are to find a definitive solution to our external- debt problem, the burden of which is another obstacle to progress and greater social development. It would be most promising if agreement could be reached on the mechanisms to solve this economic, financial such mechanism might be a re-examination of the idea of converting external debt into investment and into projects with proven social impact. and socio-economic problem. One The preservation of the environment and the fight against drug trafficking are questions that demand consideration. The 1972 Stockholm Declaration established the foundations for some universal principles for the protection of the global environment and efforts to control pollution and combat desertification and deforestation. Reality, however, called for new initiatives, which culminated in the Rio Conference on Environment and Development. We hope that the results of that Conference will be of benefit to all and help ensure mankind's the sustainable development and future well-being. I should, however, like to emphasize the obligation of the developed and industrialized countries — which bear the greatest responsibility for the deterioration of the global ecosystem — to those countries that today are being asked to make the sacrifice of limiting their legitimate right to the use of the riches nature has bestowed on them. Fitting compensation must be forthcoming, particularly through the funding of technological cooperation. alternative projects and its national Within its modest financial means, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea has been and remains ready to take action to improve its contribution to the task of preserving nature throughout the world. The Government of Equatorial Guinea is also giving its constant attention to the struggle against the AIDS pandemic, and, thanks to the deep awareness of the people of Equatorial Guinea and the assistance we are environment as 16 For all those reasons, we hope that the United Nations will continue to enjoy the full support of all of us in working to achieve a better world in the coming 50 years. Mr. Tshering (Bhutan): I have the honour to convey to you, Mr. President, and, through you, to all the delegations here present the warm greetings and good wishes of His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, King of Bhutan, for the success of the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I should first like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your unanimous election, which is a testimony to the high regard that the international community has for your country and the confidence of this Assembly in your personal leadership. Given your long association and intimate knowledge of the United Nations, we are sure you will provide the necessary direction on the many important issues that we are about to take up during this session. I should also like to take this opportunity to place on record our deep appreciation and gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally for the excellent manner in which he conducted the proceedings of our last session. His innovative and vigorous pursuit of discussions on the reform of the United Nations, the restructuring of the Security Council and the hearings on development have set the stage for the current discussions. We should like to pay a tribute to our Secretary- General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his distinguished leadership. We appreciate his tireless efforts to steer the United Nations in bold and new directions. We had the opportunity to welcome President Mandela and to hear his historic and enlightened address in this Hall. We welcome the end of apartheid and South Africa's return to the family of nations. In the Middle East, the transition of the Gaza Strip and Jericho to Palestinian self-government, the return of President Yasser Arafat the Washington Declaration between Jordan and Israel clearly demonstrate the increasing desire for peace in the region. We applaud the parties for the brave decision to embark signing of and the General Assembly Forty-ninth session 25th meeting 10 October 1994 on the difficult path to peace. It is our hope that all parties will join the process towards peace and reconciliation, based on the relevant Security Council resolutions. It is our hope that the international community will support the Palestinian people in bringing about economic development in the self-rule areas. the smaller Member States — the United particular, Nations guarantees independence and sovereignty and provides an opportunity to participate in international dialogue. The United Nations also provides both the intellectual and the material input required for social and economic development in many developing countries. The situation in the Gulf warrants our close attention. The international community must reject any threat against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait. We urge all parties to abide by and fully implement the relevant Security Council resolutions. Prince Sisowath Sirirath (Cambodia), Vice-President, took the Chair. The problems in Rwanda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Haiti and many other parts of the world still demand the careful and urgent attention of the United Nations. These conflicts the international community's capacity and resolve to deal with humanitarian needs and conflict resolution. severely test We welcome the continued reduction of nuclear weapons and the turning-away of such weapons from their previous targets. We support the extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons beyond 1995 and the proposal for the negotiation of a comprehensive test ban. We urge the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to continue negotiations in earnest and to comply with the International Atomic safeguards agreement; thereby avoiding suspicion and doubt. Energy Agency's My delegation supports the proposal for both the reduction and the clearance of anti-personnel mines. The manufacture of, trade in and deployment of such weapons, which cause indiscriminate and mindless death and maiming, are unconscionable. We urge all parties to participate in the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms. The scope of the exercise should be expanded to include not only trade but also manufacture and stockpiling. The arms trade should cease to provide an opportunity for profiteering on the part of any State. For several years now we have been talking about restructuring the United Nations. The discussions continue, but, so far, little, if any, substantive reform has taken place. In our humble view, reform of the United Nations must reflect the perceptions and expectations of all Members. For many of the larger Member States, the United Nations is a forum in which to project and promote national policies. But in the case of the developing countries — in It is clear that the General Assembly — the only forum in which all Members of the United Nations are represented — must be the main focus of our attention. The relationship between the General Assembly and other United Nations organs must be reviewed and put in proper perspective. The General Assembly itself must be able to appreciate and understand the work of the specialized and other agencies of the United Nations and to provide direction. It must also organize itself in such a way that it can deal more effectively with its business. Routine and symbolic resolutions must be dealt with efficiently, allowing the Assembly to focus on new and more important challenges. The relationship between the General Assembly and the Security Council is particularly intriguing. It is a common mistake to think that these two bodies function like the legislature and the executive of a government. This myth has been perpetuated by decades of Security Council paralysis and by the artificial prominence achieved by the General Assembly through the passing of ineffective but symbolically important resolutions. The reality is that there is only one body of authority in the United Nations — the Security Council. The Council's decisions are binding on all Members. They carry the sanction of international law. The Assembly is explicitly forbidden to interfere in the work of the Council unless requested to do so. The case for reform of the Security Council is overwhelming. The Council must be expanded to reflect the new realities of international relations and to make it a more representative body. It is also important that the deeper structural flaw be redressed and the Council be made more accountable. in expenditure The financial position of the United Nations continues to be a matter of concern. The sudden and quantum jump peace-keeping operations — now more than three times greater than expenditure on development — is becoming difficult to sustain. There are large-scale arrears in contributions. We do not object to peace-keeping operations, but it is clear that the finances of the United Nations must be put on a sound footing. Financial expenditures reflect the on 17 General Assembly Forty-ninth session direction and priorities of the United Nations, as well as the commitment of its Members. The Secretary-General, in his report entitled “An Agenda for Development”, states: “Development is a fundamental human right. Development is the most secure basis for peace.” (, para. 3) is alarming today is that These statements provide, in brief form, the best rationale for recommitment to development in the post-cold-war era. Like peace, development is not a new issue before the United Nations; the United Nations and its agencies have been engaged in international development for decades. What the gap between the standards of living of developed and of developing countries — the rich and the poor — is growing. The concern arises not because the well-to-do are doing better but because the poor are doing worse. It is no longer just poverty but the destitution of one fifth of the world's population that must be addressed. Poverty saps the human spirit. the mind, making it difficult It replaces hope with despair, creativity with dullness, admiration with envy, and compassion with indifference. Poverty weakens the body, making it susceptible to sickness and disease. Poverty clouds for people to understand the circumstances of their deprivation, and generating bitterness against those they perceive as the cause of their misery. What is unfortunate is that in this day and age, given the advances that mankind has made in science and technology, commerce and industry and civil and social thought, poverty need not exist. Considerable efforts have been made to put into proper perspective the major development issues of our time. The World Summit for Children, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the Eighth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VIII), the World Conference on Human Rights and the recently concluded International Conference on Population and Development not only generated a remarkable convergence of views but also resulted in commitments to redress global concerns in the participants' respective areas. We have no doubt that the international community will approach the World Summit for Social Development and the Fourth World Conference on Women, to be held in 1995, with the same resolve and determination. We have all committed ourselves to accepting the conclusions of the major conferences, including the various 18 25th meeting 10 October 1994 programmes of action and the prescribed targets. All countries are working hard to translate the commitments into action, but the resources available are insufficient for effective and lasting intervention. It is a matter of great concern that, in fact, the resources made available for development are declining. The future of global development clearly hinges on the provision of additional resources — additional resources in the shape of increased official development assistance for both multilateral and bilateral programmes; additional financial institutions; additional resources through direct foreign investment and trade; and additional resources generated internally through the creation of financial markets and the expansion of the revenue base. from international resources little for most least-developed While there seem to be many avenues for increasing the transfer of resources, the reality is that they have yielded countries. International banking and investments are highly selective and, by their nature, will not be attracted to the least- developed countries, many of which have a small economy and a poor infrastructure. The creation of internal financial markets and the expansion of revenue are hampered by the low level of savings and the limited cash flow in the economy. The capacity of the least- developed countries to compete in international trade is also limited. increased official development assistance many least-developed countries will fall further behind — and their situation is already precarious. Clearly, without It is ironic for that resources international development should decline when the United Nations agencies are embarking on a major thrust for poverty alleviation and sustainable human development. We urge the donor community to continue supporting the United Nations funding agencies. Although the trend towards bilateral the donor community should draw on the advantages of working through the United Nations agencies, given their long experience and commendable performance in many areas. These agencies must regain the confidence of the donor community and better coordination. cooperation is understandable, through greater efficiency Credit is an essential form of input in any major development effort. The crushing debt burden of many developing countries and the manner in which future credit requirements will have to be met must be clearly Our dealt with in our dialogue on development. General Assembly Forty-ninth session discussions must include the role of the Bretton Woods institutions, which must be made to work in harmony with the efforts of United Nations agencies. among others, generous assistance Bhutan long ago accepted that development must be participatory and environmentally sustainable. To this end Bhutan has committed itself to maintaining 60 per cent of its land mass under forest cover, including 20 per cent as national parks. All development activities have been built around this approach. We have been fortunate to receive the India, of, Switzerland, Japan, Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria, Norway, Kuwait, Germany, Australia and the United Kingdom. Considerable support has also been made available from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations Volunteers (UNV), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank and the Asian Bank. We have never taken the involvement of any of our development partners for granted, and we take this opportunity to express the sincere gratitude of the people and the Government of Bhutan to all of them. The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is a time for celebration. There is much that the United Nations has achieved for which we should all be proud. Yet it is also a time for reflection and self-assessment. The success of the next 50 years of the United Nations will depend largely on our ability to meet the challenges of global human development.
