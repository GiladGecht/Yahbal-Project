{"speech":{"0":" Allow me at the outset to extend to Mr. Amara Essy the warmest congratulations of the Greek Government on his election to the presidency of the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We are particularly pleased that his presence this year will provide the African States, with which Greece maintains excellent relations, with a further opportunity to make an essential contribution to the successful outcome of our work. I would also like to thank Ambassador Insanally for the constructive and efficient manner in which he performed his duties as President of the General Assembly during its forty-eighth session. I wish to take this opportunity to address sincere congratulations to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who is striving with courage, energy, political will, vision and perspicacity for a new world, a world in which law and ethics will prevail, and for the restructuring of the Organization to enable it to meet the challenges of our time. He has our full support in his efforts to fulfil his mission. The Foreign Minister of Germany, in his capacity as President of the Council of the European Union, delivered a statement yesterday on behalf of the European Union and its member States. My Government subscribes to its content. However, I should like to address some issues of particular interest to Greece which, apart from the statement of my German colleague, Klaus Kinkel, are further elaborated in the European Unions memorandum. The United Nations is facing the challenges and preoccupations of our times. And now, more than ever, it must become the forum to which all those who are suffering injustice will naturally resort, knowing that justice will be done. To this end, it is the duty of all to abide by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which they have accepted of their own free will, and to observe the rules, to the development and establishment of which In this context, all must respect they have contributed. United Nations resolutions, particularly those of the the body on which the international Security Council, community has conferred primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. This is the only way in which we can strengthen the moral stature of the United Nations and contribute to the attainment of its goals. 8th meeting 28 September 1994 Bearing this in mind, we welcome and strongly support the efforts of the Secretary-General in the area of preventive diplomacy and the maintenance and promotion of international peace and security, within a broader framework which, in addition to the political and military aspects, also has an economic and social dimension, particularly with respect to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Respect for human rights constitutes one of the most important factors for the maintenance of international peace and security and must be regarded as a prerequisite for development in all areas and for democratic existence. The Vienna World Conference on Human Rights was an important milestone, as was the establishment of the post of High Commissioner for Human Rights, whose mandate we fully support, and the mission of the Centre for Human Rights. the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, as well as other international acts and instruments, should guide the actions of all Member States on a daily basis. The principles of The international community is called upon to confront many problems among the Members of the Organization. Fortunately, considerable progress has been achieved during the past year with regard to some of them. I should like first to refer to the case of the Middle East. Greece, a neighbouring country and a traditional friend of the peoples in the region, is particularly pleased by the continuous and promising steps taken recently to strengthen peace and security and to arrive at satisfactory arrangements for the Palestinian people, steps which will open up prospects for a final, generally acceptable, settlement of the long-lasting Middle East crisis. The other case I should like to mention is that of the restoration of democracy in South Africa. Who would not agree that the peaceful change achieved in that country by leaders such as President Mandela and Vice-President De Klerk, is an example to follow? This change was made possible, however, only because both men had the will to abolish the system of apartheid and to establish a democracy based on tolerance and respect for human rights. In both cases Greece did its utmost to contribute to the successful outcome of the efforts pursued to achieve these results. 23 General Assembly Forty-ninth session of life and human tremendous However, during the same period of time, mankind has had to endure crises which have caused incalculable loss suffering. Unfortunately, there are many such examples that could be mentioned in Africa, Asia, Central America and Europe. Rwanda, whose tragedy borders on genocide, is one of the most telling cases. Greece, as a member of the European troika, took part in a mission of the European Union to Rwanda and its neighbouring countries, in order to assist in the task of finding solutions to this tragic political conflict and to the problem of the refugees. As a representative of a Balkan country that has a primary interest in stability in the Balkans, and contributes decisively to its consolidation, I will now refer specifically to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, which continues to be a source of serious concern to the international community, and to European countries in particular. In spite of the major efforts of the international community, war is raging in the region for the fourth consecutive year. The victims on all sides are countless and the number of refugees is increasing dramatically. Greece international peace-making efforts. During the first part of this year when Greece held the presidency of the European Union, my country undertook a series of initiatives, aimed at arriving at a political solution of the conflict through negotiations. participates actively all in The proposals of the contact group constitute a realistic basis for a settlement and must be accepted by the Bosnian Serb side as well. President Milosevics decisive stance vis-a-vis this approach, and we hope that it will lead the Bosnian Serbs to accept the peace plan. In this context, we welcome Security Council resolutions 942 (1994) and 943 (1994). the Bosnian Serbs strengthens The concentration of efforts aimed at ending the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina does not mean that less attention should be paid to a solution of the problem of the Krajinas, nor that its importance should be underestimated. Greece the rapprochement of the parties involved, so that a mutually acceptable settlement might be achieved. is willing contribute actively to to We have, however, inherited yet another problem since the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia, that of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It lies in the fact that the new State insists on calling itself \"Macedonia\". The Greek people and the Greek Government cannot accept this together with provisions of the denomination because, 24 8th meeting 28 September 1994 Constitution of Skopje, of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the propaganda against our country, as well as the appropriation of Greek national and historical emblems on their flag, indicates irredentist claims against Greece. We hope that the good offices of Mr. Vance, on the basis of Security Council resolution 817 (1993), and the ensuing negotiating process within which Greece has demonstrated its good will and constructive approach, will soon bear fruit. it Another serious international and European problem, which is of considerable interest to the United Nations, the European Union and Greece in particular and which, unfortunately, remains unsolved, is that of Cyprus. More than 20 years after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and 20 years after this body, in this very Hall, demanded the immediate withdrawal of all foreign occupation troops, a considerable part of Cyprus is still under occupation. Basic human rights are still being violated, and the tragedy of the refugees and of the missing and enclaved persons persists. Furthermore, in spite of the relevant United Nations resolutions, the mass establishment of Turkish settlers continues unabated, thus distorting the demographic composition of the island. The Secretary-General, in his latest report to the Security Council, unequivocally acknowledged that it is the lack of political will of the Turkish Cypriot side that, over a number of years, has impeded any progress in the peace process. In spite of the many face-saving efforts being made, the Secretary-Generals conclusion cannot be questioned. But even if some would wish to deliberately hide from the truth, the recent decision of the Turkish Cypriots, which rejects the very basis for a settlement - namely the Federation - that had been agreed and sought from the start, the unequivocal and unconditional support that this decision received from Ankara, revealed the true Turkish sentiments and objectives: contempt for the United Nations resolutions and the preservation of illegally acquired territories following the invasion and the occupation. as well as There can be no doubt that this Turkish attitude of provocation is supported by the Turkish military presence on the island, which has gone unpunished for so many years. That is the reason why we believe that the efforts of the international community should focus, as a matter of priority, on the withdrawal of the Turkish occupying troops. In this context, President Clerides fair and balanced proposal for the demilitarization of Cyprus should be duly taken into consideration. General Assembly Forty-ninth session The Secretary-Generals recent efforts are in progress, and we are awaiting their results. However, mere verbal support by the international community for the Secretary-- Generals initiative will not suffice. The time has come to assist the Secretary-General with concrete actions aimed at Ankara, which is, of for developments in Cyprus. If, however, those efforts are not successful, as has happened in other cases, the international community will have to consider new, alternative methods and measures that will ensure the implementation of United Nations resolutions calling for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of the Republic of Cyprus, together with respect for the rights and freedoms of all its citizens. the restoration of the key factor course, The strengthening of good-neighbourly relations on the basis of respect for international law, national sovereignty, human rights and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States is the cornerstone of Greek foreign policy. The implementation of those principles bears particular importance with regard to the relations between Greece and its neighbours. In this context, it is the sincere wish of the Greek Government that relations between Greece and Turkey be normalized. It goes without saying that such a normalization of Greek-Turkish relations presupposes a just and lasting solution to the Cyprus problem and the restoration of the rule of international law with regard to Cyprus. Moreover, respect in conformity with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris, is the only possible basis and consolidation of a climate of mutual trust between Greece and Turkey. law and human rights, establishment international the for for Greece abides by the same principles in its foreign policy towards Albania. We aspire, through a dialogue which we have repeatedly sought, to the development of good-neighbourly relations and cooperation in all areas, within a framework of mutual territorial integrity and national sovereignty and of the unconditional implementation of international instruments that safeguard respect for human rights. respect for Ample evidence of this policy is provided by the extensive and multifaceted economic and humanitarian assistance that my country has extended to Albania in recent years, in support of that countrys reconstruction following a long period of totalitarian rule and in support of its economy by various means, including, inter alia, the from illegal Albanian massive flow of remittances 8th meeting 28 September 1994 immigrants, hundreds of thousands of whom live and work illegally in Greece. On the other hand, the large Greek minority in Albania had been deprived by the previous regime of all its fundamental rights and had hoped that a change in Government would lead to a change in their conditions. Unfortunately, however, the new Albanian Government has pursued the same policies of its predecessors. Members of the minority are persecuted, and many internationally recognized fundamental human and minority rights are being violated in practice and not admitted to, in spite of the verbal assurances to the contrary of the Albanian Government. This is the case, for instance, in the field of education, with which the High Commissioner the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Mr. Van Der Stoel, with whom the Greek Government is harmoniously cooperating, has been especially concerned. for National Minorities of The oppressive policy of the Albanian Government has culminated in the harsh sentences delivered against five leading members of the Greek minority, after a parody of investigation and judicial procedure, as witnessed by unprejudiced observers from international organizations. All the above justifies the impression that the Albanian leadership is promoting a climate of harassment against the Greek minority, so as to force its members to abandon their ancestral homes. that, as Greece reaffirms it has assured the Secretary-General, it sincerely favours the development of good-neighbourly relations and constructive cooperation with Albania, and calls on the Albanian Government, in conformity with its international commitments, to respect the human rights and the individual freedoms of the Greek minority, so as to create the conditions necessary to ensure the development of such relations. There are many other problems on which I would like to express the views of my country. However, time is limited and I will constrain myself to addressing those we deem particularly important. In spite of Significant and daring steps have been taken in the area of disarmament. the confrontation between East and West, however, arms control and disarmament remain issues of primary importance due to the appearance of new sources of tension which jeopardize our the non-proliferation of arms. the end of towards efforts 25 General Assembly Forty-ninth session 8th meeting 28 September 1994 The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) has played an important role to this day, and we believe that its unconditional and unlimited extension at the coming Conference of 1995 will further strengthen the overall legal status of non-proliferation. in March 1995, and the Fourth World Copenhagen, Conference on Women, in Beijing, in September 1995, as well as all the other meetings that took place last year on economic and social issues, are paving the way in the right direction. Moreover, I feel terrorism. scourge of it necessary to underline the importance that Greece attaches to the struggle against the international My country unequivocally condemns all terrorist acts and actively contributes - working within the framework of close cooperation with competent international organizations - to all actions and efforts aimed at their elimination. However, I want to stress that economic and social development, safeguarding the rule of law and respect for human rights and individual freedoms are the most efficient and radical means to do away, once and for all, with this international scourge. countries third and In concluding, I would like to express my countrys interest in the future development of the institutional aspects of the Organization, in particular with regard to the Security Council, and to stress that Greece is willing to contribute actively to the consultations currently under way on these issues so as to achieve the best possible result for all Members of the United Nations. In the same spirit, I would like to reaffirm Greeces full and unwavering commitment to the purposes and principles of the Organization within the context of international cooperation and solidarity. We undertake to contribute with all our means to the struggles and efforts to create lasting conditions that will ensure, at the dawn of the next millennium, that all peoples fully enjoy the benefits of freedom and development within a peaceful, democratic and creative environment"}}
