{"speech":{"0":" May I congratulate Foreign Minister Essy of Cote dIvoire on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. I am confident that he will steer our work to a successful conclusion, and I pledge him the full support of my delegation. I wish also to take this opportunity to express my Governments satisfaction that South Africa, which now takes its place as a full and respected member of the community of nations, has been reinstated in the General Assembly. It is a much-vaunted truth that the end of the cold war has released the United Nations from the bondage of a world obsessed with military security. But there is another change at work - perhaps less abrupt but equally epoch-making - in the international system which has far- reaching implications for our world Organization. I refer to the progressive intertwining of the destinies of the 18 24th meeting 10 October 1994 different peoples of the world, the globalization of the world economy, the communications revolution and the increasingly transnational nature of the issues of human survival, be they environmental problems, poverty, refugees or population pressures, and the eroding capacity of the nation-State to address them single-handedly. Global interdependence is causing greater demands to be made on the United Nations than at any previous time. The will to cooperate is gradually replacing the spirit of confrontation throughout the world. At the same time, it is not clear that we have created an organization equal to the task of meeting the host of new demands. Though adept at analysing their sources, we are still inclined to deal with conflicts only after they arise instead of preventing them. The dangers we face may be novel, but the structures we draw on to cope with them derive from a world that has largely vanished from view. Last but not least, we saddle the United Nations with new responsibilities without providing adequate resources to tackle them. In this way, a discrepancy has come about between our expectations of the United Nations and the ability to deliver on them. While our main challenge should be to seek to transform the United Nations into a more effective instrument for dealing with issues that truly are beyond the compass of the nation-State, we should also bear in mind that the United Nations was not designed to be a substitute for national Governments. Wherever possible the United Nations should work with its Member States in areas where they are competent and draw to the maximum extent possible on regional organizations. In so doing, we reduce the burden on the United Nations and facilitate the setting of priorities. Looked at in this perspective, a number of developments over the past 12 months give the United Nations reason for encouragement. Democracy and the principles of the free market are making new inroads, and the protection of human rights is gaining momentum in many parts of the world. In Eastern Europe the process of democratic change is now irreversible. The negotiated withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic States has removed from the European continent one of the last vestiges of the cold war. In Northern Ireland there is for the first time since early this century a realistic chance of lasting peace and stability. the breakthrough achieved last year has been consolidated with the Gaza-Jericho Agreement and a peace accord between Israel and Jordan, hopefully paving the way for a comprehensive peace settlement in the entire region. In the Middle East General Assembly Forty-ninth session In South Africa, the spirit of dialogue has finally triumphed over the forces of hatred and racism, offering a model of tolerance for other countries on the troubled African continent. In Western Sahara, there are brightening prospects, provided that all the relevant parties do their part in creating the necessary climate of confidence to enable the people of Western Sahara to decide their own destiny in a democratic election. But there have also been setbacks. Gross violations of human rights have continued in places as far apart as Haiti and East Timor. The tragic injustice in the former Yugoslavia, the chaos in Somalia, as well as the terrible carnage inflicted on the people of Rwanda by their own compatriots, demonstrate the intractable nature of many of the conflicts that our Organization is being called upon to deal with. inter-State conflicts which traditionally have preoccupied the United Nations, these are conflicts taking place within the confines of the nation- State, where legitimate authority has either collapsed or been emaciated by civil strife. As the Organization adapts itself to the new demands of the post-cold-war era, ways must be found to address such internal crises in full conformity with the United Nations Charter. Unlike the To heed this call, greater attention must now be concentrated on the preventive dimension. Much effort has in recent years been devoted to peace-keeping, which now extends to non-military operations, including electoral assistance, the provision of humanitarian relief and human rights monitoring. This is as it should be, and countries contributing substantially to such peace-keeping operations certainly deserve both our gratitude and respect. At the same time, we must make sure that the necessary resources are also allocated to development. One of the lessons we have learned in recent years is that we must focus more intently on the link between peace and development. Increasingly, we have come to understand that peace and security require solutions to social and economic problems, that without development there can be no peace. In this connection, I wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros special Boutros-Ghali, whose agenda for development, submitted two years after his pathbreaking Agenda for Peace, has sharpened our awareness of the need for creating an infrastructure of peace. For there to be a stable and lasting infrastructure of peace, a number of elements must be in place: a commitment to democracy and respect for human rights, a 24th meeting 10 October 1994 sound social fabric, a growing economy and a sustainable natural environment. the celebrates fosters the greatest As a representative of one of the worlds oldest democracies — one which fiftieth anniversary of its second republic this year — I cannot be accused of underrating the redeeming virtues of democracy, which, as was pointed out earlier in this force behind social and debate, economic progress: individual creativity. Democracies, as a rule, also tend to honour human rights. By promoting tolerance and respect for the dignity of the individual, we contribute to preventing cultural, ethnic and territorial conflicts. For good reason, human rights are therefore increasingly being considered as an integral part of the notion of extended security. It is thus to be regretted that the efforts of the United Nations in this important field continue to be strained due to lack of financial resources. standards, not least with respect The effective implementation and monitoring of to human rights vulnerable groups, should be a matter of priority for the United Nations. The plight of children in some parts of the world gives cause for grave concern. Four years ago, the largest gathering of world political leaders assembled here in this Hall of the General Assembly and endorsed the principle that children should have the first call on the resources of society essential to their survival, protection and development. Next year we will assess how far we have come in honouring the commitments undertaken by the Summit for Children. At the same time we will be celebrating the half-centenary of the United Nations. In the view of my Government, this milestone event should be used to give new impetus to efforts to ensure that children are given the best social conditions the world community can offer. As it happens, the fiftieth anniversary celebrations will coincide with the Beijing Conference on the status of women. The timing is significant as the goals of achieving equality, empowerment and security for women are key to the social agenda of the United Nations as it makes second half-century. Improving the status of women is of paramount importance for the well-being of the family, and has positive multiplier effects on overall levels of education, health and population growth in society as a whole. the transition into its Conversely, where society has broken down or social safety-nets are inadequate, women assume the largest burden. There is therefore a direct link between the 19 General Assembly Forty-ninth session the recent Fourth World Conference on Women, International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo and the World Summit for Social Development, to be held in Copenhagen next spring. The Copenhagen summit will afford us a much needed opportunity to focus attention on the social ills that compromise the ability of nations to develop their full potential, be they poverty or disease, homelessness or hunger, joblessness or social exclusion, crime or violence. Fifty years after the United Nations avowed in its Charter to promote social progress and better standards of living in the time has come to put sustainable greater freedom, human development at the Organizations agenda. the top of In relieving the plight of the most underprivileged segments of the worlds population, the role of economic growth can hardly be overstated. The abolition of trade barriers is the single most important factor for world economic growth. Just as a rising tide lifts the boats, so an increase in world trade will create new jobs and raise incomes around the world. My Government therefore strongly welcomes the establishment of the World Trade Organization and urges other signatory States to ratify the Uruguay-Round Agreement without undue delay. Focusing on economic progress must not, however, blind us to the need to keep an eye on other areas, which, if neglected, might strip us of the harvest of increased prosperity. One such area is the environment. Over the past few years the United Nations has made significant headway in its efforts to promote sustainable development worldwide. the Rio Conference on Environment and development provide a sound basis for further work. As we now assume the momentous task of development, measures must also be taken to protect the environment from detrimental patterns of production and consumption. The results of It is a hopeful sign that shown increasing awareness of While recognizing the need to take a balanced view of the ecosystem as a whole, Iceland remains particularly concerned over the deteriorating condition of the worlds oceans. the international community has the importance of the sustainable utilization of the living resources of the sea. It has been estimated that the poorest two-thirds of the worlds population get about 40 percent of their protein from fish, and that food production must more than double just to keep pace with the growth in demand in the decades ahead. it will be necessary to rely not only on agriculture but also - and to this growth, To meet 20 24th meeting 10 October 1994 an increasing extent - on the sustainable utilization of the living resources of the sea. Such considerations notwithstanding, the ecosystem of the sea is now in greater danger than ever before from pollution and overfishing. Protecting the oceans against the repercussions of economic and industrial expansion will pose a major challenge to the international community in the years ahead. Although much has been accomplished, existing conventions aimed at containing the pollution of the marine environment cover only a part of the problem, as no global scheme addressing pollution from land-based activities is in place. For this reason, Iceland attaches great importance to the Conference on the Protection of from Land-based Activities, to be convened in Washington next year under the United Nations Environment Programme. We urge all States and relevant international agencies to participate actively in the preparatory process, commencing officially in Reykjavik in March next year. the Marine Environment auspices of the fisheries resources The responsible use of The universal acceptance of is, however, no less important than combatting the threat of marine pollution. the sovereignty of the coastal State over its adjacent waters was a necessary precondition of the effective management by the world community of the living resources of the sea. The application of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which extended the rule of law to over two thirds of the Earths surface, has contributed more than any single undertaking to the furtherance of that goal. Against this background, Iceland particularly this Convention, a crowning welcomes the fact achievement progressive of international the United Nations, will come into force in only a few weeks time. in law under the auspices of development that the My country remains strongly committed to the establishment of an international regime governing all aspects of the utilization of living marine resources, including the high seas. For this reason, Iceland has actively supported the drafting of a legally binding and comprehensive instrument that would ensure the effective management and conservation of fisheries outside the economic zone of the coastal State. In Icelands view, this goal could best be achieved by establishing regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements open to States with legitimate interests in the relevant fisheries. Such provisions should not, however, be understood as implying approval of existing forms of cooperation based, in some instances, on unilateral decisions by a few States General Assembly Forty-ninth session at other excluding neighbouring States, aimed notwithstanding the latters overwhelming dependence on and proximity to the fisheries in question. Indeed, unjustified discrimination would defeat the very aim of establishing a new high seas fisheries regime for the benefit of all nations. The global challenge of development calls for bold new thinking, backed by the solid commitment of the international community to the goals enshrined in the United Nations Charter. It also demands that we try to establish consensus on the restructuring and reform of our Organization in the near future. Efforts must be made to improve the representational capacity and efficiency of the Security Council and at the same time preserve the constitutional balance between the various organs of the Organization, not least between the Council and the General Assembly. We find ourselves on the threshold of a new era. Yet, we are far from having rid ourselves completely of the legacy of the cold war, which includes immense quantities of armaments and the technology for producing them. It would certainly be disastrous if the recent transformation of the to be undermined by the growing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. security environment were international indefinite importance that In this connection, my Government deems it of the utmost the Convention on chemical weapons enter into force next year and that the Convention on Biological Weapons be further reinforced.

And in what better way could we make a clean break with the cold war era? Mr. Acharya (Nepal): It is a special pleasure for me to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, Foreign Minister of Cote dIvoire, on his unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. We are confident that under his able leadership the deliberations of this session will come to a fruitful conclusion. My delegation extends its full support to him in carrying out his important duties. 24th meeting 10 October 1994 I should also like to express my delegations appreciation to His Excellency Ambassador Samuel R. Insanally, the Permanent Representative of the Republic of Guyana to the United Nations, for successfully presiding over the General Assembly during its forty- eighth session. I also take this opportunity to express my admiration to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the dedication, commitment and insight with which he has been serving the United Nations. As a Vice-Chairman of Since the end of the cold war the world community has faced many developments, both encouraging and disturbing. the Special Committee against Apartheid — now dissolved — Nepal feels particularly happy about the end of the apartheid regime in South Africa. As President Mandela said in his speech earlier in this session, it was one of the ironies of our age that it was only so late in the twentieth century that such a regime came to an end. The United Nations role in the establishment of a united democratic and non-racist South Africa has been gratifying to all of us. The end of apartheid represents progress on the part of mankind in its history of civilization. The statesmanship of President Mandela can be a source of inspiration for those who are in search of freedom, peace and justice elsewhere in the world. Nepal also welcomes the progress in the Middle East peace process and looks forward to the establishment of comprehensive peace in the region. We hope that such achievements will inspire peoples in conflict with each other elsewhere to end their hostilities, and to start similar peace processes. There are also disturbing areas of conflict. The Nepalese people are grieved at the enormous loss of life and the extensive material devastation in Rwanda. It is our hope that with the active support of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in conflict resolution, the United Nations peace-keeping efforts will facilitate the process of restoring normalcy and a peaceful civil society in Rwanda. Nepal also appreciates the role played by the OAU in Burundi in terms of conflict prevention, management and resolution. We hope that the OAU mechanism will be applied effectively to other troubled parts of the region such as Somalia, Angola and Liberia, in order to restore normalcy. Nepal is also deeply distressed by the tragedy which, despite the Security Councils resolutions, continues 21 General Assembly Forty-ninth session unabated in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We would like to urge all the parties concerned to seek peace through dialogue and negotiation rather than through violence. Nepal also looks forward to an early restoration of the democratically elected Government in Haiti, which alone can ensure full respect for human rights in that country. We are meeting on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, which will be a time for us to reflect on the past five decades and plan for the next 50 years. Born as a result of the Second World War, the United Nations has over the past five decades ceaselessly deployed efforts to prevent a third world war. Disarmament, especially nuclear disarmament, has therefore been one of its major concerns. The United Nations also made constant efforts to bring peace to the Middle East and to put an end to apartheid in South Africa, and it remained engaged in many other areas of conflict. However, the last five decades, characterized by the cold war, almost paralysed the United Nations. in the ultimate analysis, The East-West divide seriously hampered the United Nations efforts in most conflict situations. A number of important agreements were reached and many peace negotiations were held outside the United Nations. Nevertheless, those achievements were in conformity with the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations, and the United Nations provided an important global forum for discussion, which helped defuse major global catastrophes. Thus, the United Nations has undoubtedly made significant contributions to international relations. Moreover, the United Nations and its specialized agencies and other related bodies, such as the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Childrens Fund, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Population Fund, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and many others, have been engaged in improving social and economic conditions around the world. Since the cold war, whose enormous cost adversely affected the lives of billions of people, is now over, we at the United Nations, standing — as it were — at the crossroads of history, can now define the Organizations role and work for the next 50 years. With such rapid changes taking place in international relations, particularly in recent years, the United Nations needs to be restructured and revitalized. The restructuring of the Security Council has assumed a particular urgency. Nepal strongly supports an increase in the membership of the Council to reflect, not only the increase in the general 22 24th meeting 10 October 1994 membership of the United Nations, but also the reality of the present world. A review of the Councils membership has also to take into account the contributions of Member States to the maintenance of international peace and security. We attach a high priority to greater transparency and openness in the Councils work, and also attach great importance to the principle of equitable representation, which would give all United Nations Members — large or small, rich or poor, powerful or weak — a reasonable opportunity to contribute to the work of the Council. We hope that the work of the Open-ended Working Group on the Security Council and related issues will be fruitful in due time. Our delegation considers that the reform and expansion of the Security Council should also include measures geared to reforming its working methods and procedures. In addition, there is a need to enhance the relationship between the Security Council and the General Assembly, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. Rather, In this context, I wish to recall The changed context of international relations and the United Nations preoccupation with peace-keeping operations should not be allowed to deflect attention from efforts to achieve general and complete disarmament under effective international control. the propitious climate now prevailing calls for strengthening the role of the United Nations in arms control and disarmament. the unanimous political support expressed by the General its last session for the decision of the Assembly at Conference on Disarmament to give to its Ad Hoc Committee on a Nuclear Test Ban a mandate to negotiate such a ban. To this end, the Non-Aligned Movement, of which Nepal is a founding member, has called for a special session of the United Nations General Assembly on disarmament in order to undertake a comprehensive assessment of progress towards global disarmament. Like the rest of the international community, Nepal looks forward to the early conclusion of a comprehensive treaty prohibiting nuclear tests in all atmospheres. A non- discriminatory and effectively verifiable test-ban treaty would have a positive impact on the success of the Conference on the review and extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which is due to be held in 1995. In addition confidence-building measures, the United Nations role in arms control and disarmament needs to be effectively strengthened. In this pursuing to General Assembly Forty-ninth session context, the United Nations Regional Centres for Peace and Disarmament can play an important role, as they provide much-needed forums for the exchange of views. The United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific has already held several meetings to promote such a process of dialogue and interaction. Nepal is firm in its conviction that peace-keeping operations, though extremely important, especially in this post-cold-war period, are no substitute for the peaceful resolution of conflicts through political dialogue and mediation. Application of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations in the restoration and maintenance of international peace and security should be invoked by the Security Council only as a last resort, fully respecting the principles of impartiality and non-selectivity. Nepal has supported fully the Secretary-Generals in expanding preventive diplomacy and conflict resolution. We have consistently committed our troops to the peace- keeping operations undertaken by the United Nations through the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and the United Nations Protection Force. initiative Besides serving in Cambodia during the critical stage of democratic elections there, Nepal has also sent civilian police monitors for electoral assistance in Mozambique. Nepal has also sent troops to Somalia, despite the heavy loss of life and casualties suffered by our young men. We would like to pay tribute to those Nepalese soldiers and to the others who gave their lives in the relentless pursuit of international peace Prime Minister Giri ja Prasad Koirala, to the roundtable on United Nations peace-keeping operations in Kathmandu, stated: and security. in a recent statement “While the Government (of Nepal) has raised its voice at the United Nations and in appropriate international forums for more effective mechanisms for the safety and protection of our personnel, the Government reaffirms its commitment to continue to participate in such operations with a sense of responsibility and solemn obligation.” Since peace-keeping operations have become more complicated and more expensive in recent years, there is greater urgency to make those operations cost-effective and efficient. Peace-keeping contributions must be paid in full and on time so that the troop — contributing countries may be in a better position to maintain the most critical element in peace-keeping operations — the troops. My Government holds the death and disability compensation to all troops should he based on equity. We the firm view that 24th meeting 10 October 1994 hope to review the current guidelines on this matter in order to arrive at a standard compensation package applicable to all. that Every peace-keeping operation should be devised with a clear mandate, a realistic time frame and a correct assessment of the situation. Furthermore, we would like to reiterate timely consultations with troop- contributing countries are essential elements for the enhancement of the United Nations. Nepal welcomes the Secretary-Generals initiative on stand-by arrangements for peace-keeping. We are studying the proposal seriously, especially in view of current events the establishment of such an arrangement. the peace-keeping capability of that highlight the need for for ensuring inter alia, to security lies, Since the threat of Agenda the planet The Commission in non-military sources such as the lack of economic and social development, Nepal stresses the need for timely implementation the 21 for present and future sustainability of generations.

The Commission should build a bridge between the North and the South to enable the developing countries to follow the path of sustainable development. By providing transferring additional environmentally developing countries, the international community can surely reach the goals set in Agenda 21. In our view, the level of consumption and wastage in most industrialized countries also needs to be moderated if we are to achieve the goals of sustainable development. technology and to resources financial sound on the The success of population and socio-economic hinges full development programmes empowerment of women. The focus given to the empowerment of women in decision-making, especially in planning the size of a family, at the recent International Conference on Population and Development is a mater of satisfaction to my delegation. However, the success of the Plan of Action as adopted requires increased financial resources. The developing countries, despite their severe resource constraints, have been committing significant amounts in population activities at the cost of other important areas that are required for economic growth and development. That important conference will be followed by the World Summit for Social Development, the fourth World Conference on Women and the 1996 United Nations 23 General Assembly Forty-ninth session on the small natural disaster reduction, Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II). This year alone, we have participated in many important conferences: on sustainable development of island States, on combating desertification and drought, and on population and development. A question remains outstanding: that of the availability of the critical resources for the successful implementation these conferences. The developing countries find themselves in an exasperating situation, trying to cope with their responsibilities, as outlined in previous agreements and resolutions, without from the industrialized countries. the necessary actions recommendations the of of Nepal fully shares the Secretary-Generals view that an alternative to the United Nations in the field of development simply does not exist, especially in the light of the new vision of development as inextricably linked with peace and security. We reiterate our view that there must be close cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions. The main objectives of the proposed agenda for development should successful implementation of existing programmes for the alleviation of poverty. The agenda should be an instrument that looks after the most vulnerable and the weakest nations of the world. ensuring directed towards he The conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the signing of the agreements at Marrakesh undoubtedly constitute a historic breakthrough in the international trade regime. The window of opportunity is now open for many developing countries to enhance their trade and development. Once again, the least developed countries will be left out, in spite of this tremendous opportunity now available to many. The lack of basic physical infrastructure and the absence of a manufacturing base will prevent the least developed countries from taking advantage of this new opportunity. The least developed countries, including my own country, have suffered for decades. These handicaps, however, have not deterred us from our determination to cooperate fully with the international community by instituting structural adjustment programmes liberalization policies, including privatization. and economic lacking Structural adjustment programmes due consideration for social safety nets have pushed a large sector of the worlds population towards more misery and discontent. Economic liberalization programmes without adequate institutional and organizational set-ups have not yielded the desired results in many countries. The major purpose of the privatization programmes undertaken by 24 24th meeting 10 October 1994 it may be appreciated that many developing countries — the efficient and productive use of resources — has yet to be fulfilled. At the same time, these inadequate measures, resulting in higher inflation, a distorted market system and increasing unemployment, may result in greater social tension. We are happy to note that in the context of the follow-up to the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action, an open-ended Working Group of the Third Committee has been established; we hope it will review the mandates of existing human rights machinery, taking into account the balanced emphasis between civil, political, cultural, economic and social rights, as well as improving human rights on the basis of the principles of impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity. consequences outside Violation or suppression of human rights within a nations boundary have its boundaries as well. People unable to live in conditions where human rights are suppressed are forced to flee their own homelands and take refuge elsewhere. United Nations agencies such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the World Food Programme, and international and non-governmental humanitarian organizations, are well aware of this. My delegation would like to commend the work of these United Nations agencies. We also feel that the agencies must be mandated to serve all the people in such difficult situations. The Constitution of Nepal enshrines the principle of universal human rights. We believe that the right to development is an integral part of human rights. Nepal is now party to 14 international human rights instruments, including all the major Conventions and Covenants. A national action plan on human rights is being prepared in line with the final document of the Vienna Conference on Human Rights. is also Nepal consolidating the multi-party democratic system that was restored by the people through a popular movement in 1990. Nepal participated actively in the Second International Conference of New or Restored Democracies, at Managua, Nicaragua, in July this year. The Conference provided us with an opportunity to share each others experience of nascent democracy. In November this year the people of Nepal are participating in our second general elections on the basis of adult franchise. We are confident this exercise in democracy will give an impetus to the long- term economic development of our country. that General Assembly Forty-ninth session The Charter of the United Nations captures the highest ideals of mankind. However, much remains to be done to put those ideals into practice. We look forward to 24th meeting 10 October 1994 the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations as the occasion to work for instituting dynamism and efficiency in the United Nations. My delegation is fully confident that our vision of the United Nations as a symbol of peace, security, human rights and development will be realized if Member States demonstrate the political will and provide the necessary financial and material support to the Organization"}}
