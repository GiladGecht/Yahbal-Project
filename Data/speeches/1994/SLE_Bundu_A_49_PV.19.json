{"speech":{"0":" It is with great pleasure that I congratulate Mr. Amara Essy on his election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. His remarkable talent and consummate experience assure us that we can feel proud and confident as he discharges his new functions admirably and with distinction. His leadership of the Assembly confers dignity on Africa, on West Africa and on his country, Cote dIvoire, with which Sierra Leone happily enjoys excellent bilateral relations and shares a common West African identity. We extend to him an abiding wish for his success. To Ambassador Insanally of Guyana, his immediate predecessor, I convey my delegations gratitude and appreciation for the commendable manner in which he performed his duties as President of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly. The approach adopted by the Secretary-General of our Organization since he assumed office has been exemplary in many ways. He deserves high tribute for his untiring efforts over the past two years, especially in the realms of the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of development. The world is still in transition. Although the outcome of the process of transformation is not easy to predict with 20 19th meeting 5 October 1994 any degree of certainty, it is nevertheless clear that the world will continue to be preoccupied in the next half- century with problems carried over from the last - problems concerning the promotion of development, especially the maintenance of peace and security; and the consolidation and strengthening of the process of cooperation and integration between nations. These are among the major challenges of our time. developed countries; least the of Developmental and political issues now occupy a larger part of our global, regional and national agendas, and the past 12 months have been no exception. In some cases, these developments have been a source of joy and satisfaction; in others, the stigma of shame and disgrace has loomed larger. On the economic front, the slow, uncertain and unbalanced growth of the economies of developing countries generally has been a source of grave concern. This is evidenced by the alarming increase in the number of peoples living in absolute poverty, stagnating resource flows, dwindling direct foreign investment, reduction in rising export unemployment, and environmental degradation. especially among excruciating earnings, youth, the debt crises, threats The persistence of these problems could easily undermine the stability of the world economy and pose serious to international peace and security. Immeasurable work has been done to redress the economic stranglehold in which most of our countries find themselves. A lot more, however, needs to be done by the developed countries and the international financial institutions to prevent many of the worlds poor countries from being completely submerged by the heavy burdens imposed by the present international economic system. More specifically, new, additional resources, at both the multilateral and the bilateral levels, need to be provided by our development partners if any improvement in the lives of the teeming millions in the third world is to be assured. transition programme — all The situation is even more acute for my country, which is in the throes of a rebel war and implementing a substantial economic reform programme as well as a political three activities taking place simultaneously. Hardly any other State member of the Assembly shares this unique experience. Given the increasing interdependence and globalization of the world economy, the massively deteriorating economic situation of the developing countries and, in particular, the General Assembly Forty-ninth session uniqueness of the plight of Sierra Leone deserve the full and urgent attention of all the members of the international community. Poverty and the decreasing living standards of the majority of our people are at the heart of our problems. To alleviate these problems, my Government has embarked on courageous, wide-ranging and far-reaching socio-economic reforms, including the deregulation of prices and exchange and interest rates, and the reduction of fiscal deficit. The pace and scope of these reforms, however, contrast sharply with the very modest results achieved so far. Despite considerable success in securing short-term macroeconomic stabilization, the reforms appear to have neither removed the structural constraints facing the economy nor improved supply capacity. We are now resolved to ensure that future adjustment programmes are designed and implemented in a manner that takes due cognizance of the special needs of the vulnerable groups of our society as well as the social requirements of development. Those are just some of the difficult tasks ahead. They are made no less formidable by the new challenges posed by the Uruguay Round agreements signed at Marrakesh last April. My Government welcomes the new agreements, but would stress the need for continued evaluation of their implementation to ensure expansion of world trade for all countries, improved market access and adequate protection the least developed countries in of particular. to impose new conditionalities, encompassing environmental and labour conditionalities in this context, must be strongly resisted. the interests of Any attempt, therefore, In the meantime, the observation is inescapable that the Marrakesh agreements pose a real danger to trade preferences previously assured developing countries; this can lead to a loss in export market share and export earnings. Moreover, countries that are net importers of food face the prospect of higher food-import bills arising from the liberalization of trade in the agricultural sector. There is therefore a need to address without delay the question of how the adverse consequences of the Marrakesh agreements can be mitigated through enhanced trade preferences, assistance and compensation. The external indebtedness of developing countries poses the biggest impediment to their development. A permanent and comprehensive solution must therefore be found without further delay. That is why we commend the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, His Excellency President Soeharto of Indonesia, for taking the initiative to convene in Jakarta last August a ministerial meeting of 19th meeting 5 October 1994 non-aligned countries on debt and development, with the theme “sharing of experiences”. That high-level meeting on the debt crisis of developing countries, which I attended together with Ministers from twenty-five heavily debt-distressed, least-developed countries, endorsed a number of general principles for debt reduction, which represent a significant step in the search for a lasting solution to the debt problem. We therefore urge the United Nations and the international community to adopt the principles contained in the report of the Jakarta meeting, submitted to the Assembly by Indonesia. The African leadership must Calling upon the international community to pay special attention to the problems of developing countries is not a proclamation of abdication of responsibility. In Africa, for example, we have accepted that the key to is in the hands of Africans sustainable development themselves. therefore demonstrate a determination to stay the course of in appropriate economic reforms and improvement governance. We do emphasize, however, that the international community must play a crucial supportive role in the creation of the environment necessary to guarantee sustainable growth and development of developing countries in ways that include the provision of adequate levels of concessional, financial and technical support for infrastructure and national capacity-building on a continuous, predictable and assured basis. for Social Development The issues I have raised will no doubt be on the agendas of certain conferences slated for the coming year. The World Summit in Copenhagen, March 1995, will provide an opportunity for all of us to focus on such matters as socio-economic developmental challenges, the adoption of a global strategy for poverty eradication, the generation of productive employment and the enhancement of social integration — in all of which the needs of people will occupy centre stage. The situation of women and the need to integrate them better in the development process as agents and beneficiaries of development will also receive attention at the Fourth World Conference on Women, to be convened at Beijing in September next year. is convening a high-level intergovernmental meeting to conduct a mid-term global review of progress in the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries in the 1990s. Naturally, my delegation holds high and conclusions of these meetings will make substantial contributions towards creating the climate necessary for recommendations This Assembly, for its part, expectations that the 21 General Assembly Forty-ninth session 19th meeting 5 October 1994 enhancing the socio-economic conditions of developing countries. There are at least three lessons to be learnt from the South African experience: the Secretary-General In the same vein, my delegation commends the timely initiative of in submitting “An Agenda for Development” pursuant to the resolutions of this Assembly. It provides us with another historic opportunity to address the root causes of poverty and underdevelopment of the developing countries in a holistic and comprehensive manner. We urge the Secretary action-oriented -General recommendations the socio-economic conditions of these countries and to suggest practical measures for their implementation. to make for concrete, the enhancement of Turning now to the environment, my delegation is concerned at the general response to the recommendations, decisions and commitments of the Rio de Janeiro Conference on Environment and Development, held over two years ago. True, some progress has been recorded since that Conference. What is missing, however, is a clear commitment on the part of the developed countries to provide financial and other relevant resources for the implementation of Agenda 21. We in the developing world are committed to implementing Agenda 21, but this commitment will remain illusory unless it is complemented by adequate human, financial and technical resources. the holding of On the world political scene too, the picture that we see concurrently inspires hope and engenders desperation. Without a doubt, the first pluralistic, non-racial, democratic elections in South Africa, in April this year, and the subsequent installation of a Government of national unity, marked a major achievement not only for the people of South Africa but also for this Organization. The patient and dedicated struggle of all peace-loving South Africans to resolve peacefully the abominable policy of apartheid, aided by the committed solidarity of the world at large, has been amply rewarded. In taking this opportunity, on behalf of the Government and the people of Sierra Leone, formally to welcome South Africa back into this world Assembly, I wish to reiterate our commitment to work together with the new Government to make our continent a better place for all of us. Theirs has been a long and arduous journey through dark and difficult times that tested both courage and faith. The presence of the South African delegation here today is a confirmation of mans ability to rise above those conditions that threaten his survival and to resolve them peacefully, though they may have originally appeared insurmountable. 22 First, with South Africas freedom, the non-white peoples of that country, and indeed everywhere, are enabled to regain their lost humanity. While apartheid existed, its stigma touched many, even beyond that countrys borders. Yet, with that policys banishment from the South African landscape, this Organization should now rekindle its sense of purpose to continue the struggle against racial discrimination and segregation wherever they exist. Secondly, the attainment by South Africa of democratic values under a non-racial Government of national unity should demonstrate to all countries, especially in Africa, that excuses for denying a similar transformation to our own societies are now untenable. Thirdly, the fact that such a man as Mr. Nelson Mandela could emerge from 27 years of imprisonment on Robben Island and, setting aside any bitterness, preach and national reconciliation should in itself encourage our brothers and sisters in divided societies to forswear retribution and strive instead for tolerance and harmony. accommodation demonstrate and These lessons have not been lost on us in Sierra Leone. We have come to understand and appreciate from this exemplary South African political experience that, where democratic principles are applied in full in the governance of any nation, there is every likelihood that solutions will be found to the political problems of that nation, however intractable they may appear. Conscious of this fact, the Government of the National Provisional Ruling Council of Sierra Leone, headed by His Excellency Captain Valentine Strasser, has unveiled a political the installation of a democratically elected government in our country by January 1996. reform programme that will ensure by Mr. James Jonah, With that in view, an Interim National Electoral Commission of eminent citizens has now been constituted, headed former Under- Secretary-General of this Organization. Furthermore, as a result of extensive debates on an initial Working Document put together by a National Advisory Council, the draft constitution has now been finalized and will soon be presented to the people for final approval. Meanwhile, a National Commission on Democracy, which will undertake a programme of mass education to let the people appreciate the values of democracy and their rights General Assembly Forty-ninth session and duties as citizens, will soon be appointed. All these steps are designed to underscore the commitment of my Government towards the full restoration of democracy in Sierra Leone by the end of 1995. Let me assure this Assembly that the Government of the National Provisional Ruling Council remains fully committed to the transition programme, which continues to be on course. We look forward to the the international community in enabling us to realize the programmes objectives. cooperation and assistance of Allow me at this point to recall the adoption by the General Assembly last year of resolution , entitled “International assistance to Sierra Leone”, and our continued expectation for the full implementation of its provisions. We are appreciative of the assistance extended to Sierra Leone so far by the international community, especially in the humanitarian field, and look forward to its continuation and increase in the future. Yet, as promising as the nations prospects are, it should not be forgotten that we are engaged in a rebel war whose origins are inextricably linked to the Liberian conflict, and whose consequences are still visible in the large number of refugees and internally displaced Sierra Leoneans, who now total an estimated 300,000 and 400,000 respectively. the countrys economically productive areas continues to undermine an already fragile economy. the untold devastation of Further, be greatly success will My Government realizes that even though our meagre resources are now committed to bringing this rebel war to an end, we must necessarily look forward to the reconstruction of our country and its economy, a task whose through collaboration with the United Nations system, especially in working out a programme for the rehabilitation of the devastated areas and the resettlement of our refugees and displaced citizens. To this end, we have already laid the foundations for the expeditious rehabilitation of these areas upon the conclusion of the war, by setting up a National Rehabilitation Committee that will oversee our efforts in this matter. enhanced While, as a Government, we continue with reluctance to pursue the military option in prosecuting this war — and we wish to record here our appreciation to all friendly Governments, particularly Nigeria, Guinea and the Peoples Republic of China, for their assistance in that effort — let me say here and now that no option is foreclosed. We remain amenable to any option, military or non-military, that will secure a speedy conclusion to this untenable 19th meeting 5 October 1994 situation, thus ensuring the creation of an environment conducive to the holding of the elections anticipated in our transition programme. The success of these undertakings and of others in my Governments transition programme depends largely on the progress that is made in restoring peace to Liberia, hence our deep concern about developments taking place across our border. It is in this connection that we renew our commitment to the Cotonou accords and reiterate that they contain the essential elements for the resolution of the Liberian conflict, namely the disarmament of the warring factions, leading to the holding of elections. Drawing from the experience in Angola, it is clear that without such disarmament, peace in Liberia will be tenuous at best. We therefore call on the United Nations and the international community to support the Economic Community (ECOWAS) to financially, reinvigorate and that disarmament gains renewed momentum. of West African States logistically and otherwise in order the process ensure peace Given our own refugee situation, we are gravely concerned about the increasing flows in the world refugee population, about half of whom are children, whose needs should be met through appropriate measures of protection and assistance. This International Year of the Family therefore provides an excellent opportunity to focus attention on the essential needs of refugee children. In contemplating concrete measures to be taken by the international community in addressing this phenomenon, it is essential that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child be fully implemented. As crucial as these measures are for mitigating the global refugee problem, we remain convinced that, unless and until the international community overcomes the scourge of poverty and political strife, this problem will remain constantly with us. is our fervent hope, therefore, that a renewed impetus will once again be found to prevent and eradicate this condition of boundless human misery. It Looking beyond the borders of our region, Sierra Leone acknowledges the signing of the Washington Declaration by Israel and Jordan, ending the state of war between the two countries. We see this as a continuation of the peace process that started three years ago and that led to the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self- Government Arrangements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. It is a positive development, coming after the assumption of Palestinian self-government earlier this 23 General Assembly Forty-ninth session 19th meeting 5 October 1994 and anticipates of year, comprehensive peace among all concerned parties in the Middle East. attainment the eventual In this connection, my Government would like to commend the role of the United States and Egypt for their relentless efforts in bringing together Israel and its Arab neighbours. We urge Israel on the one hand, and Lebanon and Syria on the other to intensify their efforts and display the spirit of accommodation that had underpinned successes in other areas, so as to make the important objective of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East realizable within the shortest possible time — in the interest not only of the people of the region, but of the world at large. With regard to the dispute between Kuwait and Iraq, we call upon Iraq fully to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait in accordance with the terms of the resolutions of the Security Council. We would also hope that in other areas, such as Somalia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, there will be progress in bringing to an end the present unacceptable stalemate. While the absence of progress may be frustrating, we nevertheless believe that it would be a tragic mistake even to contemplate disengagement from peace- keeping operations in Africa at this crucial stage. By far the most appalling situation that the international community has had to confront recently is that in Rwanda. We will not readily forget those graphic images of death, abject misery and destruction, or soon overcome the torment and challenges that our collective conscience has had to face. It is hard to explain and harder still to understand how those dark days from April to July could have taken place in this century in full view of the world. That such a tragedy occurred at all points to the failure of existing international mechanisms for responding to such devastating situations. Drawing from the Rwandan experience, the time has come for all of us, but more so for us in Africa, to come to terms with the diverse nature of our societies and realize that the denial by any group of the right of another group or section to participate in the life of a nation is indefensible and ultimately self-destructive. Peaceful coexistence of heterogeneous communities and power- sharing within a nation are great values we must all uphold. Further, we believe that painful admissions must be made. A few years ago, when the Monitoring Group of the 24 of West African that country back from the brink. States Economic Community (ECOMOG) was deployed in Liberia, much criticism was levelled against it. We were accused of harbouring ulterior motives against that country and of encouraging intervention. Yet, looking back, none will deny today that by its deployment ECOMOG averted a similar tragedy in Liberia. Concerted action by West Africans brought Today, ECOMOG represents Africas flagship in preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping, peace-building and peace enforcement. We call on States in Rwandas region to reassert their lead role in the search for a peaceful solution to the crisis in Rwanda. We believe that in the realm of maintaining regional peace and security, regional arrangements have an important role to play, as envisaged in Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. This has been recognized by the exemplary collaboration between the United Nations and ECOWAS on the Liberian situation. In this context also, the OAU mechanism for conflict prevention, management and resolution deserves the fullest support of the United Nations system and the international community. We are therefore deeply encouraged by the positive resonance of some members of the Security Council in that connection. We must at this point applaud the action of the French Government in Rwanda at a time when this Organization seemed completely paralysed. We believe that the French action, which undoubtedly brought a glimmer of hope to a situation that was palpably so catastrophic and which prevented a second Goma, is worthy of special mention by all peace-loving nations. We also commend the efforts of the Organization of African Unity. What is now required to stabilize the situation even further is the provision of full support for the African and other troops that have been or are about to be deployed in Rwanda. We also call upon the present Rwandan Government to continue to take all measures necessary to restore peace and reconciliation to their country. Though we must all learn the painful lessons of the Rwandan experience, it is essential that those who played a part — any part at all — in visiting such horror on the people of Rwanda be held fully accountable for their crimes. In this connection, my delegation fully supports the establishment of a special tribunal to bring to justice those responsible for what can only be described as genocide. We expect that the Commission of Experts General Assembly Forty-ninth session 19th meeting 5 October 1994 will continue to collect all available evidence to make for a speedy conclusion of this shameful episode. blessing as Mozambique embarks on the path to durable peace and reconciliation. In a similar vein, we expect that the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 will soon begin the process of examining the available evidence in order to bring the perpetrators to justice. The international community has an obligation to ensure that such callous indifference to human life and the deliberate commission of acts of atrocity, wherever they occur, do not go unpunished. The time has come for a strong message to be sent to all who may presume that no consequences will follow from such despicable behaviour simply because it takes place behind national borders. I wish to declare here and now that my Government recognizes that no true governance can endure if people are separated from and denied the full enjoyment of their freedoms and liberties. Stemming from this recognition, therefore, my Government has embarked on the major task of ratifying, as soon as possible, the remaining-human rights instruments to which Sierra Leone is not yet a party, thus guaranteeing within our domestic law their application to all Sierra Leoneans. As conflicts go, none on our continent appears more intractable than that in Angola, where more than two decades of devastation have fostered a culture of violence and war. The continuation of this conflict, which has cost the lives of countless thousands of peaceful Angolans, remains a source of pain and anguish to my Government. Although not much optimism has been evinced, there seems to be some progress in the Lusaka peace talks. With the acceptance by both the Angolan Government and UNITA of the comprehensive package put forward by the Secretary-Generals representative, there is now renewed hope that the talks will soon yield the desired result of a durable this development and would like to encourage both parties to the conflict in Angola to allow the will of the Angolan people to prevail over the barrel of the gun. delegation welcomes solution. My On the positive side, in a year that has been as volatile as this one, the knowledge that general elections will soon take place in Mozambique is cause for satisfaction. We call upon the people of Mozambique to seize this opportunity to firmly demonstrate faith in their own ability to resolve finally the many years of conflict they have endured. Africans everywhere, I am sure, will give their Among the many ills that afflict our world today, few are more inimical to the common good than the alarming resurgence of racism and xenophobia. Our concern is heightened even further when we recall that it the world is scarcely more than 50 years ago that witnessed of racial discrimination. Back then, passions were inflamed by those who argued falsely that the presence of so-called foreigners was injurious to the economic well-being of the State. the worst manifestations Today, this nefarious argument is once again gaining ground among bigots who see immigrants, asylum-seekers and refugees from other countries as targets for violence. Surely civilization has come too far this situation. It is for this reason, if for no other, that we believe that the world community should intensify the promotion of the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination and to ensure the success of its objectives. to accept To many of us it seems that the socio-economic well-being of our world is under siege from conflicts in many lands, far and near. In the Organization, our approach has been the traditional reliance on peace- keeping operations. Yet, recent experience has shown that this is not always the best option. My delegation maintains the view that the Organization would be better served by committing the greater part of its scarce resources to socio-economic development activities and preventive diplomacy. Many questions will continue to be asked about the direction that the United Nations must pursue as its fiftieth anniversary dawns. Of vital importance is still the need to encourage and provide for the full participation of all Member States in the work of the Organization. In many ways, we are convinced that the growing incidence of political instability worldwide is a strong advocate of a more efficient, transparent and democratic Security Council — a Council cultivating a culture that frowns upon a few seeking always to wield dominion over the rest. There is now a compelling case for the pursuit of the democratic ethic nationally. But it does not and should not end there: it is equally relevant to the international arena. My delegation hopes that the deliberations of the Open-ended Working Group, seized of the question of 25 General Assembly Forty-ninth session institutional reforms, will gather momentum and will bring these concerns to fruition as soon as possible. I have adverted at length to our problems, our concerns, our fears and our aspirations, which we believe we all share in this global village that is home to all of us. Over the years, we have striven together to find solutions to a wide range of problems whose impact can no longer be localized. If our journey through the decades has taught us anything, it is that blinding ourselves to the realities of our time, turning away from them, avoiding involvement or seeking solace in inaction provides only momentary consolation or comfort. The quantum leap in transport and communications makes us all our brothers keepers. No longer is poverty merely the affliction of a distant cousin in a far-off land, nor can we successfully shield ourselves from the trials and tribulations of those who may be less fortunate than we are. The lesson to be learnt from all this is that, as human beings, we have a fate inextricably interwoven, whether we like it or not. Thus, our common endeavour to improve our world should be impelled by a much bolder vision — one that brooks no compromise in combating injustice, be it political, social or economic, and one that seeks to strengthen the pillars of international cooperation, eradicate poverty and address the causes of instability. These, then, are the challenges before us that a new and revitalized United Nations must pursue with vigour and commitment. “An Agenda for Peace” and “An Agenda for Development” not only show that peace and development are inseparable twins but contain the essential ingredients of a new vision of our one world. Let us now give that vision the focus and direction of a better tomorrow. Mr. Seniloli (Fiji): On behalf of the Government and the people of Fiji, I warmly congratulate His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy of Cote dIvoire on his election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. Given his vast experience and his knowledge of the United Nations system, I have every confidence that the current session of its work successfully. the Assembly will complete I also wish to pay a special tribute to the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Samuel Insanally, for the excellent and efficient manner in which he conducted the business of the Assembly at its forty-eighth session. Most of the problems afflicting the world community that have been discussed in this Assembly in previous years 26 19th meeting 5 October 1994 continue unchanged. A survey of the world scene readily discloses that no region of the world is free from tension; that the economic divide between the rich and the poor continues to widen; that political and social upheavals in many parts of the world are getting extremely difficult and expensive to contain; and that poverty and despair remain the lot of a substantial part of the worlds population. There is an urgent need to address these problems in a comprehensive and timely manner. The piecemeal approach that we have adopted so far only tends to plug the hole and does not eliminate the causes. Moreover, our efforts are invariably made after an event has occurred, and often when our conscience cannot bear to see the misery on our television screens. We must devise ways for a more preventive approach to the problems. Political problems are often a consequence of economic and social problems. The General Assemblys decision at its forty-seventh session to convene a World Summit for Social Development at Copenhagen early in 1995 was very timely. While we have seen some significant advances in human rights and democracy in many parts of the world, and positive developments towards reducing the potential for regional conflicts in other areas, the fact remains that in both developed and developing countries new challenges to international peace and security are manifesting themselves under a broad plethora of social development problems. We can no longer turn a blind eye to the increasing growth of poverty attendant marginalization of peoples. unemployment and and the Annually, between 13 to 18 million people die from starvation, disease and famine. It has been estimated that world wide one out of every five people live below the in many cases, poverty line. While Governments, equivocate on how to solve this problem, the poor increasingly look to the United Nations to find effective, immediate and practical solutions. To ignore this reality is to deny that it constitutes a real source of political instability. Indeed, the Security council has expressed the view that “peace and prosperity are indivisible and that lasting peace and stability require effective international cooperation for the eradication of poverty and the promotion of a better life for all in larger freedom.” (0, p. 5) General Assembly Forty-ninth session These views are buttressed by the prophetic words of the Nobel laureate Ralph Bunche who, as long ago as 1950, said: “Peace is no mere matter of men fighting or not fighting. Peace, to have meaning for many who have known only suffering in both peace and war, must be translated into bread or rice, shelter, health and education, as well as freedom and human dignity — a steadily better life. If peace is to be secure, long- suffering and long-starved peoples of the world, the underprivileged and the undernourished, must begin to realize without delay the promise of a new day and a new life.” While these words were uttered in a different context, I would suggest that they encapsulate the whole reason for the social Summit. My Government will actively support and work in cooperation with other countries to achieve the objectives of the World Summit for Social Development. My Government looks forward to playing an active role in the forthcoming World Conference on Women, to be held in Beijing next September. Fiji has always recognized the important contribution of women to society and to the development process in general. In 1987, the Fiji Government established a Ministry of Women. A Department on Women and Culture, which operates under the purview of this Ministry, carries the responsibility of monitoring improvements in the status of women. It seeks to encourage the private and public sectors to address the needs of women in their policies and programmes. It is also the Governments policy to assign 50 per cent of representation in training, appointments and promotions at all levels of the civil service to women, on The Government the basis of preference and merit. encourages the same in the private sector. I might also mention that all three women members of the House of Representatives in Fiji are Ministers in the Cabinet. My Government will continue to enhance and uplift It is in the process of ratifying the the status of women. United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Fiji will also explore membership of the Commission on the Status of Women, in keeping with its policy of strengthening the role of women in the countrys national development plans. On the issue of gender equity, it is my belief that in order that the principles enshrined in the first Article of the Charter of the United Nations to be achieved, the equal participation of women in the Secretariat of this Organization, on an 19th meeting 5 October 1994 equitable regional basis, must continue to be implemented and be given urgent priority. My country was pleased to have participated in the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States in Barbados earlier this year. In short, the Conference was convened because of a universal recognition of the problems faced by small island developing States in achieving sustainable development goals. While the Barbados Conference was important in re-emphasizing the special environmental and economic circumstances of small island States, my delegation wishes to reiterate that the Conference was only the beginning of a process. We must now act to implement the Barbados Programme of Action and Declaration. and particularly those In this connection, we would urge the international community, countries with developed and industrialized economies, to respond to the invitation to enhance and promote human resource development programmes in small island developing countries. Increased technical assistance will enhance the institutional and administrative capacity of small island countries to implement the Programme of Action. One of the ways in which this can be brought about is by the provision of new and additional financial resources in accordance with Chapter 33 of Agenda 21. Unless creative and supportive international responses to the special challenges faced by small island developing countries in planning for sustainable development are urgently stimulated, continuing vulnerability to both physical and socio-economic forces will increase. In this context it is opportune to remind the global community to fulfil the commitments it made at Rio some two years ago. their that I fear We are on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations. My country strongly supports the principles contained in the Charter and I would like to reaffirm our support for the Organization. Over the past 50 years, the Organization has seen many changes. Its membership has increased from 51 to the present 184. With the end of the cold war, it has assumed a more central role in world affairs. There is an ever-increasing demand on the limited resources of the Organization and, in particular, on its Secretariat. We support the Secretariat and commend the adjustments it is making in order to respond to the changing needs of the international community. We urge the Secretariat to continue efficiency and In this regard, my Government cost-effectiveness. the goals of to pursue 27 General Assembly Forty-ninth session welcomes the creation of the Office of Internal Oversight Services. We believe this to be an important innovation that will contribute to greater efficiency within the United Nations system. We fully support the continuing efforts to bring about greater transparency and accountability on the part of the United Nations management and institutional structures. In the same vein, Mr. President, my Government supports the view that it is now time that the current structure and the membership of the Security Council were reviewed. With the very large increase in the membership of the United Nations since it was founded, with the changes that have occurred on the global political scene in recent years, and with the nature of problems that must be resolved by the United Nations, including the diverse facets of and peace-keeping and peace-monitoring issues, we agree that there is now a need to consider an enlarged Security Council with more equitable representation of membership to look at these issues more comprehensively. environmental economic, In this () regard, we welcome the report of the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council in response to General Assembly resolution of 3 December 1993, and the recommendation that the Open-Ended Working Group should continue its work. In the event that membership of the Security Council is expanded, Fiji fully supports the membership of Japan, recognizing its important role not only as a valued neighbour in the Asia-Pacific region, but also as a key player in the global economy. My Government has followed with close and keen interest, meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Elaboration of an International Convention dealing with the Safety and Security of United Nations and Associated Personnel. We consider the United Nations staff and associated personnel who participate in various missions sponsored by the United Nations as an integral and essential part of those missions. We have seen their courage in Cambodia, Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia and other places around the world. If the United Nations is to continue to rely on individual men and women to assist in carrying out the mandates of its various organs, it is only fair and fitting that we should provide them with an adequate level of safety and security. At the Ad Hoc Committee worked very constructively and made significant progress. However, is important for the Ad Hoc Committee to conclude its work as soon as possible and we urge that this be done. We have a very real interest in the its last session, it 28 19th meeting 5 October 1994 conclusion of this convention since in as much as Fiji has lost some of its nationals in various peace-keeping operations, and many others have been injured. For us, therefore, peace-keeping has come at a high price. It involves the sacrifices, not only of individuals, but also of the families left behind. But my Government remains unshaken in its belief that the price we have paid and are continuing to pay for our involvement in United Nations peace-keeping operations would have been worthwhile if we have contributed towards making the world a safer place. We owe this to our children and to our childrens children. At the present time, there are at least l,000 troops from Fiji serving in various peace-keeping operations - in Lebanon, Sinai, Iraq, Kuwait and Rwanda. Only recently we agreed to participate in the regional peace-keeping force in Bougainville in Papua New Guinea. This was in direct response to a request we received from the Government of Papua New Guinea, with the support of the relevant parties in Bougainville. Our participation in the South Pacific regional peace-keeping force for Bougainville is in concert with our other neighbours in the South Pacific, namely Tonga, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Australia and New Zealand. Our participation is also for a specific purpose, and that the Government of Papua New Guinea and the relevant parties secure environment in which they will be able to hold a peace conference and, through dialogue, achieve a consensus on the future of Bougainville. Let me say that our commitment to peace-keeping is a continuing affirmation of our belief that the purposes and principles set forth in the United Nations Charter must be given practical expression. the international community, will continue to play its role in the enhancement of global peace and security. Fiji, as a responsible member of on Bougainville is to assist facilitating in a On the subject of peace-keeping, I want at this time the to express my Governments the Department of Peace-keeping strengthening of Operations. I believe that continued innovations in the institutional structure of this Department will be necessary if it is to play a meaningful and effective role in support of United Nations peace-keeping activities. satisfaction at This year marks an important milestone in the development of the international law of the sea. Fiji was the first State to ratify the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We are therefore pleased that, 12 years after its adoption, the Convention The will enter into force on 16 November 1994. General Assembly Forty-ninth session the of been provisions implementing Convention represents a historic achievement by the international community. It will establish the rule of law over more than two-thirds of the Earths surface, and promote its peaceful use. Like many other States, Fiji has already the Convention, through its Marine Spaces Act. Entry into force of the Convention would thus consolidate our claims the territorial sea and the to the archipelagic waters, exclusive economic zone. Fiji has always supported universal participation in the Convention. We therefore welcome the conclusion of the Agreement to resolve the outstanding issues relating to the deep seabed mining part of the Convention, part XI. As at the Conference on the Law of together with other delegations, was pleased to play an active and constructive role in bringing about that important agreement. We have signed the agreement and will become a party to it. We urge all States that have not done so to become parties to the Convention and to the new Agreement in order to achieve the goal of universal participation. the Sea, our delegation, Associated with the law of the sea is the important Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. Fish is an invaluable gift of nature to man. However, mans unregulated and indiscriminate exploitation of this vital resource is rapidly depleting or destroying it. Fish is an important national and regional resource and it is a staple in our diet. In addition to other species, some 40 per cent of the worlds tuna is to be found in the south- west Pacific region. We are therefore concerned at the long-term impact on these resources and on the marine eco- system as a whole, if the current practice of uncontrolled fishing, especially on the high seas, continues. The Conference has been organized to address the urgent problems facing us with regard to the conservation and management of fisheries around the world. These problems must be addressed from the perspective of both present and future generations. therefore strongly supports an effective outcome from the Conference, an outcome that would ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of the fish resources of the seas and oceans. Our delegation, in cooperation with other delegations to the Conference, will spare no effort in working towards this goal. We are grateful for the confidence shown in our country by our election as Chairman of the Conference. Fiji the Since forty-eighth session of the General Assembly, we have witnessed positive and constructive developments in the Middle East peace process. It is almost a year now since the Declaration of Principles was signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). This was followed by the agreement 19th meeting 5 October 1994 on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area signed at Cairo in May this year. The recent peace accord between Israel and Jordan, which was signed at Washington last July, was another very positive development. My Government lends its support to the Middle East peace process. In particular, we express the hope that the ongoing bilateral negotiations between Israel and Jordan and between Israel and the Palestinians will continue. We are also hopeful that the present dialogue between Syria, Lebanon and Israel will eventually lead to further agreements. the South Pacific. I would now like to mention a number of issues in my own region, One is New Caledonia. While some positive developments have been taking place in New Caledonia in relation to the continued implementation of the Matignon Accords, I believe that there is still a need to accelerate the process of redressing social and economic imbalances in the territory. In this connection, my Government will continue to observe developments in New Caledonia with keen interest in the build-up to the referendum to be held in 1998. Nuclear issues and transboundary movements of hazardous and radioactive wastes are also of considerable concern to us in the South Pacific region. Fiji has long been a consistent opponent of nuclear testing anywhere and in any environment. Our opposition to such testing is by no means based only on environmental concerns. For hundreds of years, the livelihood of our people has depended on their limited land and on the resources in the marine environment. Fundamentally, our abhorrence of nuclear arms and nuclear testing is based on the belief that there is simply no place for nuclear weapons in our region, or indeed in any other part of the world. In this connection, we have been pleased to note the temporary cessation of nuclear testing in the Pacific region by France, and would urge the French Government to agree to a permanent moratorium on testing in the South Pacific. Fiji is a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation the Treaty of Nuclear Weapons. We believe that represents a unique achievement in the promotion of global peace and security and in the reduction of the threat of nuclear warfare. The Pacific region has long recognized and embraced the principles enshrined in the Treaty, and these principles are now reflected in the Treaty of Rarotonga, which establishes the South Pacific as a nuclear-free zone. We would, in this regard, encourage the United States, the United Kingdom and France to accede to the Protocols to the Treaty of 29 General Assembly Forty-ninth session to Rarotonga as a demonstration of their commitment nuclear non-proliferation and to a ban on testing in the South Pacific. in particular, about We are equally concerned about the transboundary movements — and, the sea transit through the region — of consignments of plutonium from Europe to Japan. For obvious reasons, we object very strongly to this development and earnestly hope that there will be no more such shipments through the region. The countries of the South Pacific region are also currently in the process of negotiating a regional convention to ban the importation into the island States of the South Pacific Forum of hazardous wastes and to control their transboundary movement and management within the South Pacific region. My country fully supports this initiative and is actively engaged in the negotiation process. The convention is expected to be adopted in mid-1995. This will further strengthen our resolve to keep the South Pacific region free of radioactive and hazardous wastes. At the national level, the Government of Fiji has commenced work on the review of the countrys 1990 Constitution. The members of the Parliamentary Select Committee on the Review of the Constitution have already been announced. They have been drawn from both sides of the House of Representatives and from the Senate, and the racial groups in our population. As represent all Chairman of that Committee, the Minister for Foreign Affairs with Special Responsibilities on Constitutional Review, Senator Filipe N. Bole, had a fruitful meeting of the Committee only a few days ago. Last November, the Cabinet agreed to the timetable for the review of the Constitution, following the approval, by Parliament, of the terms of reference of the Constitution Review Commission. Because of the general elections that were held in Fiji in February of this year, the review process has been slightly delayed, but it is expected that the substantive work of the Commission will begin soon after the Commission has been appointed, which will be done shortly. isolate itself from the vagaries of Fiji has a very small, export-oriented economy that cannot the global economy. We are less able to absorb adverse trends in external economic conditions than are larger and more diversified economies; equally, an improvement in the global economy is slow to be reflected in our own small economy. Like many small developing countries, we are still recovery following a prolonged downturn that afflicted the world as a whole. Like many countries, we have had to adjust our economic in the process of gradual 30 19th meeting 5 October 1994 This has policies in such a way as to give them a more market-oriented approach. involved the following fundamentals: less interference with the market; recognition that the Government cannot do everything and that the private sector is the engine for development, which the Government must complement rather than compete with; and the encouragement of, and reward for, entrepreneurship, skills, abilities and hard work. In this manner we are proceeding with the deregulation of the economy to bring domestic prices more closely into line with world prices; restraining the growth of Government expenditure to ensure availability of resources for growth in the private sector; reforming the system of direct and indirect taxation to minimize market distortions and improve effort; implementing wage policies that recognize the paramount importance of maintaining international competitiveness; and mobilizing all sectors of the community in support of economic expansion. These constitute a package of mutually self-reinforcing policies. risk-taking incentives for and In a world that is economically interlinked and in which we are all economically interdependent, no country, however well-intentioned its national efforts might be, can sustain itself without support and interaction from outside. This is true of large, diversified economies, and it is certainly true for small, isolated economies such as ours. Our internal efforts to create a better economic climate, if not supported by external investments, will not succeed. Nor will they succeed if we are denied or prevented from getting access to markets of more developed countries. Our efforts, therefore, depend considerably on investment from outside and on access for our products to traditional and new markets. In this regard, we express our gratitude to our developed neighbouring countries the consideration they have given to some of our exports. We believe, however, in the spirit of regional cooperation and better balance in trade the present arrangements must be further improved. that for In our efforts to develop our economy, we also count on the support and understanding of our good friends and partners in our neighbouring region of Asia. We value our increasing contacts and economic relations, particularly with the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, Malaysia, the Peoples Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan, and we are confident that these relations will continue to be strengthened in the future. Our Prime Minister, the Honourable Major-General Sitiveni Rabuka, greatly appreciated the warm welcome General Assembly Forty-ninth session that he received during his recent visit to the Peoples Republic of China and Taiwan. Fiji remains committed to its official relations with the Peoples Republic of China but also greatly values its trade and economic cooperation with Taiwan. It is our sincere hope that the Peoples Republic of China and Taiwan, talks and negotiations, will be able to reach agreement on a practicable basis on which to strengthen and expand cooperation between them, including cooperation in the international arena. in continued direct The establishment of the South Pacific Forum in 1971 was an early initiative taken by Fiji following its independence, together with Australia, the Cook Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Tonga and Western Samoa. The Forum now has 15 members, and it meets at the level of Heads of Government. The Forum originated from the desire of our leaders to develop collective responses on a wide range of regional issues, including trade, economic development, civil aviation, maritime, telecommunications, energy, environmental, and political and security matters. One significant recent development is the post-Forum dialogue: immediately after a Forum meeting, the Forum island countries meet separately with their more developed trade and economic partners to discuss development priorities and constraints in the region. The post-Forum dialogue partners include Canada, the Peoples Republic of China, France, Japan, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States. From our perspective as small island nations whose economies, to remain viable, depend to a very large extent on economic ties with these larger and more vigorous economies, we value these discussions and are confident that they will continue. In a wider context, we of the South Pacific Forum believe that it is important and indeed mutually beneficial for the Forum Secretariat to be more closely associated with the United Nations. the Forum members have decided to seek Observer status in this Organization for the South Pacific Forum Secretariat. We urge the General Assembly to give favourable consideration to this request. For this reason, Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to express, from this rostrum, the appreciation and profound thanks of my Government and people to the Secretary- General, the staff of the United Nations and its various organizations and agencies for their continued support for, and technical assistance to, our national development, and indeed, for the numerous development projects in our region as a whole. In these times, when valuable resources 19th meeting 5 October 1994 for development purposes are becoming more and more scarce and difficult to come by, I wish to assure the donors and agencies that my Government will manage and utilize carefully and effectively. resources these scarce "}}
