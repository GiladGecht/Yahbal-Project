My delegation very much appreciates his untiring and effective leadership and his dedication to the work of Under his presidency, the General Assembly had an eventful year, and its role was enhanced in ways which were beneficial to the Organization. this body. the the rest of Thailand joins international community in congratulating the Government and people of South Africa on having established a united, democratic and non-racial country. They have shown us that compromise is possible and that even the most long-standing and bitter of conflicts can be resolved is due entirely to the peacefully. This achievement exceptional vision, courage and pragmatism of the countrys in particular, President Nelson Mandela and Executive Deputy President F.W. de Klerk. Tribute must also be paid to the United Nations, and in particular to the Special Committee against Apartheid, for its contributions to the positive changes in South Africa. leaders - There is another bright spot giving all of us hope for a more peaceful world. Since the Thai Government has the long supported the Middle East peace process, General Assembly Forty-ninth session termination of the state of war between Jordan and Israel, announced in Washington in July this year, following last years historic agreement between Israel and the PLO, gives all of us reason to rejoice. We hope that it will lead to further agreements on \"other tracks\" acceptable to all parties concerned, so that a durable peace in the Middle East may finally be achieved. We the positive also welcome developments concerning the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and hope that dialogue and negotiation between the parties concerned will eventually result in that part of the world enjoying lasting peace and stability. However, in spite of the promising outlook for international peace and security, there remain political and military conflicts of both global and regional magnitude. It is therefore imperative that countries continue unfailing international efforts to secure a stable and peaceful environment. the international community could support and cooperate in towards efforts total revitalization of to enable the Organization to meet the new challenges of todays world and to assist Members efficiently in their peaceful endeavours. comprehensive the United Nations As a first step in this direction, reform and Thailand pledges its continued support the Secretary-Generals proposals in \"An Agenda for Peace\". These constitute an innovative and practical framework for the maintenance of international peace and security and deserve serious consideration by all Member States. for international environment, and peaceful In South-East Asia, realizing the need to ensure a secure the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) took the lead in promoting political and security dialogues and consultations in the Asia-Pacific region by initiating the establishment of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF). Designed to be a high-level consultative forum on political and security matters, the ARF held its first meeting in Bangkok on 25 July 1994, after the twenty-seventh ASEAN ministerial meeting. Nineteen ministers from countries in the Asia-Pacific region and from the European Union attended this historic meeting to discuss political and security cooperation issues, such as the latest developments on regional situations, and decided to carry out some practical confidence-building measures applicable to the Asia-Pacific region. As Chairman of the first ARF meeting, Thailand is the meeting and its results of pleased with the 23rd meeting 7 October 1994 In particular, Thailand is grateful for the achievements. kind cooperation it received from all countries concerned. Since the success of this first meeting, the ARF has become a viable forum for the promotion of trust as well as political and security cooperation within the Asia-Pacific region. The ARF has also demonstrated its potential to make substantive contributions towards the United Nations efforts at preventive diplomacy and at maintaining international peace and security. In other words, the ARF got off to a good start. Thailand is fully aware that the first meeting of the ARF in Bangkok was only the beginning. For this reason, Thailand views the inter-sessional activities at various levels among officials from ARF countries as necessary for the ARFs continued success. These activities could help the ARF find its future direction and enable it to become more efficient and productive. Political and military security are but one aspect of the bigger picture facing us. As we search for a new international order based on a common set of principles and values, we need to change our way of thinking. We also need a new culture of development cooperation and new definitions of security and development. the notions of Last year (in Vienna), The winds of change have begun to sweep across the globe. We are now witnessing the creation of major landmarks of international consensus-building. In 1992, the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit set a new stage for global partnership on the environment and sustainable development. the World Conference on Human Rights was held, producing a world programme of action. Last month in Cairo we witnessed the International Conference on Population and Development. Next year in Copenhagen, the World Summit for Social Development will be held. This Summit will serve as a bridge between this years Conference on Population and Development in Cairo and next years Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing. It also presents a unique opportunity for the international community to respond, on a global level, to urgent human and social concerns that place people at the centre of the development process. The Thai Government accords special importance to social development. In light of this, we have established a social cabinet dedicated to formulating policies and finding solutions to a number of pressing social problems. We have also organized a joint committee comprising members of the private sector and of Government and 19 General Assembly Forty-ninth session Its mandate is to oversee chaired by the Prime Minister. efforts to alleviate the social problems that beset a growing economy, such as those being experienced by my country and others in the region. Thailand has participated and will continue to participate actively in all global deliberations. These conferences create new paradigms of international conduct which give rise to the various comprehensive global plans of action. They have also started the new process of redefining the notions of security and development. Security in this final decade of the twentieth century goes well beyond the familiar concepts of old. It must involve people - how they live and how they exercise their choices. It should be security with a human face, because it must deal directly with political, economic, environmental and social aspects of our lives in a comprehensive manner. Development, as pointed out by the Secretary-General, must be seen in its five interlinked dimensions: with peace as the foundation; the economy as the engine of progress; the environment as a basis for sustainability; justice as a pillar of society; and democracy as good governance. My country shares these perceptions and supports their premises as envisioned by the Secretary-General. that development It is with this awareness that Thailand approaches its work on the international agenda for development. Such an agenda should reflect and indeed promote self-reliance as well as interdependence among Member States. There is no doubt is primarily a national responsibility. Yet, it is also a shared responsibility of the international community. It is our firm belief that the development effort of any State in todays world must be supported by a conducive international environment, based on free and fair trading practices. The completion of the Uruguay Round and the creation of the World Trade Organization now hold out the prospect of providing significant benefits to the world economy. A United Nations agenda for development should not be given any less importance than the agenda for peace. These two intertwined issues must be the core of any effort to strengthen the role and activities of the United Nations as we approach the next century. Together with the \"An Agenda for Peace\", \"An agenda for development\" should serve as an instrument for the coordination of activities within the United Nations, as well as between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods It institutions, and other non-governmental organizations. 20 23rd meeting 7 October 1994 should be an instrument to create unity of purpose, at both the policy and operational levels, within the Organization. The United Nations cannot be a strong force for peace unless it is also a strong force for development. The United Nations remains humanitys best hope for creating a more desirable world - a world with a conscience, a world which recognizes that humans everywhere, young or old, strong or weak, are at the centre of our communal and individual efforts. To this end, I should like to reaffirm Thailands commitment to this vision, which cannot be fulfilled without the active participation of Member States. Thailand will do its part in contributing to this end. We hope that other countries will also chip in with their fair share of contributions. A world united by this vision and this unity of purpose will surely be a better place for us all and, more important, for our children and grandchildren. "}}
