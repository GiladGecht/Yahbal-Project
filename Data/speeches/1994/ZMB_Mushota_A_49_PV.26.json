{"speech":{"0":" join the representatives who in congratulating you, Sir, on your unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. You represent a country, Cote dIvoire, which has played and continues to play an active role in the framework of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and in the United Nations. You bring to the presidency vast experience in the area of international relations as well as diplomatic skill and acumen, which puts you in 13 General Assembly Forty-ninth session the General good stead to steer Assembly to a successful conclusion. You can count on my delegations unqualified support and cooperation. the deliberations of to I also wish to express my delegations sincere appreciation predecessor, His Excellency Ambassador Samuel Insanally of Guyana, who presided over the work of the forty-eighth session with great distinction and rare personal attributes. your Mr. Blandino Canto (Dominican Republic), Vice- President, took the Chair. Our distinguished Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has continued to provide outstanding Zambia is leadership in the discharge of his duties. particularly grateful for his untiring efforts in pursuit of world peace and security, development and international cooperation. to the Secretary-General In the view of Zambia, The past year has been one of mixed blessings on the international scene, a year of notable achievements and failures. the most positive development of the year was the achievement of majority rule in the Republic of South Africa. My delegation is really delighted to see in our midst the delegation of a democratic and non-racial South Africa, led by President Nelson Mandela. President Mandela was the symbol of the liberation struggle in South Africa and it is therefore befitting that he, an icon of the liberation struggle, should become the first President of a new South Africa. to the is without a doubt due The return of South Africa to the family of the United Nations tenacity, uncompromising commitment and dedication of our brothers and sisters in South Africa who bore the brunt of the evil system of apartheid. At the same time, it cannot be denied that South Africas victory over apartheid and its rejoining the United Nations is a concrete manifestation of the seminal role played by this Organization. In order to consolidate the democracy achieved in South Africa and address the negative social and economic legacy of apartheid, substantial international assistance is imperative. In this regard, Zambia endorses the appeal made by President Nelson Mandela for international support to South Africa to enable the effective implementation of its reconstruction and development programme. A democratic, peaceful and prosperous South Africa will no doubt have a positive impact on southern Africa and Indeed, South Africas the African continent as a whole. 14 26th meeting 11 October 1994 It has, the Southern African contribution as a member of Development Community has already begun to be felt and appreciated. together with Botswana and Zimbabwe, also played a highly commendable role in the peaceful the constitutional problem in Lesotho. We have every confidence, therefore, that South Africa will contribute positively to the work of the United Nations. resolution of Africa has had a few other bright spots. We are delighted with the peaceful resolution of the territorial dispute between Chad and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. The positive developments in Burundi towards a peaceful resolution of the long-standing conflict are commendable. However, There is therefore a need to sustain international engagement. the situation remains volatile. With regard to Angola, it is indeed gratifying that the talks between the Government of Angola and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), which have been taking place in Lusaka, Zambia, for the past eleven months under the chairmanship of the United Nations Secretary-Generals Special Representative, Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, have made tremendous progress. We therefore look forward to a successful conclusion of the talks by the end of October, culminating in the signing of a peace agreement, by the middle of November 1994, on the basis of the Bicesse Accords, and the pertinent resolutions of the Security Council. In this regard, we take this opportunity to commend both the Angolan Government and the UNITA delegation for their seriousness and commitment to the task of finding a peaceful solution to their countrys fratricidal war. We also thank the observers to these talks, namely the United States, the Russian Federation and Portugal. Sustained international assistance to Angola will be necessary in the post-agreement era and Zambia will continue to assist the people of Angola during this period. In Mozambique, we look forward to the holding of the first multiparty elections, scheduled to take place on 27 and 28 October. We commend the Mozambican Government and RENAMO for committing themselves to the United Nations peace initiative and to the Rome Agreement. We applaud the role that the United Nations has played through its peace-keeping efforts and in helping to prepare the people of Mozambique for the forthcoming elections. As a gesture of solidarity with the people of Mozambique, Zambia has made a modest contribution to the United Nations peace-keeping operation. General Assembly Forty-ninth session In Malawi, we welcome the recent peaceful and democratic transition to a multiparty system of government. We endorse the appeal made by President Bakili Muluzi for international assistance to consolidate democracy and to assist in the reconstruction of the country. My Government also commends the technical and advisory services provided by the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat of the United Nations. the trend positive Zambia welcomes towards democratization on the African continent. Why should Africa democratize? Africa should democratize because it is our firm belief that democratic systems of government promote good governance, transparency and accountability in the administration of public affairs, independence of the judiciary, and respect for human rights and the rule of law. These qualities lay a firm basis for peace and stability and are thus conducive to sustainable development. We would therefore urge all of our development partners to take account of all in the formulation of their development policies towards Africa. They should also endeavour to explain to their taxpayers the significance of these democratic changes and their correlation to sustainable development. The electorates of the North must be made to appreciate that it is in their enlightened self-interest to support developing countries. There is now much hope in Africa. Indeed, Africa, in the long run, holds the promise of a positive and prosperous future. these positive developments In the Middle East, we welcome the positive developments in Palestine following the agreements and declarations between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel, as well as between Jordan and Israel. It is our sincere hope that progress can also be achieved in the negotiations with the Syrian Arab Republic and Lebanon. International assistance is urgently required for the reconstruction, rehabilitation and other essential needs of the Palestinians. their Israel, We commend the efforts deployed by the leadership of the PLO and of tenacity and their determination to work for peace. We also commend the crucial catalytic roles played by the United States of America and the Russian Federation as co-sponsors of the talks. The Kingdom of Norway also deserves our gratitude for its contribution to the peace talks. The sustained support and commitment of the Arab League to the peace process also merit special mention. On the other hand, negative developments abound in Africa and elsewhere on the international scene. These 26th meeting 11 October 1994 conflict situations continue to defy durable solutions through dialogue, reconciliation and negotiation, in stark contrast with the exemplary cases I have just cited. Thus, in our region, the civil wars in Liberia, Rwanda, Somalia and the Sudan torment us all because of our aversion to fratricidal and ethnic violence and the serious humanitarian crises they have engendered. In this connection, Zambia also strongly condemns ethnic violence wherever it occurs, including in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We deplore the further deterioration of the situation in Liberia. We regret the lack of progress towards disarmament, demobilization and general elections. We appeal to all the parties to commit themselves to the Cotonou and Akosombo Peace Agreements. We also wish to stress the need to maintain the Military Observer Group of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOMOG) in Liberia and to provide it with the requisite logistical support. As for Rwanda, we and the entire world community have been deeply shocked by the genocide and the most dehumanizing spectre of violence in that country, resulting in one of the worst humanitarian and refugee crises in the history of mankind. Zambia has expressed its strong condemnation of the genocide and mindless violence in Rwanda. We strongly feel those responsible for the massacres must be brought to trial through an international tribunal. Conditions of peace, security, stability and confidence should be created in Rwanda in order to facilitate the repatriation of refugees from overburdened neighbouring countries. We hope that the new Government will commit itself to carrying out its declared intention to work for reconciliation, rehabilitation and reconstruction in Rwanda. Substantial assistance for humanitarian, rehabilitation and reconstruction purposes is thus crucial. The neighbouring asylum countries also need assistance. that The role and efforts of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) in creating conditions of stability and security in the country are crucial. We therefore deeply regret the delay in the deployment of UNAMIR troops to the level of 5,500 in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions. In this regard, African countries have been ready and willing to send sufficient troops. However, the major constraint has been inadequate logistical support. 15 General Assembly Forty-ninth session As a token measure, Zambia has contributed a peace-keeping contingent of civilian and military personnel to the UNAMIR operation, thanks to the generous logistical support, in materiel, from the Netherlands. Furthermore, the Zambian Peace Corps, a non-governmental organization, has organized activities to purchase medicines, food and other humanitarian requirements for the displaced people in Rwanda. to raise funds We remain concerned by the continuing crisis in Somalia and by the lack of progress. We note, however, the genuine efforts being deployed to resolve the crisis. Notwithstanding the difficulties, we strongly believe that the continued presence of the United Nations in Somalia is critical. In Sudan, the continuing civil war and factional fighting in the south and the deteriorating human rights situation nationwide are a cause of serious concern to us in Zambia. We urge the parties to reach a negotiated settlement. As to Haiti, Zambia reaffirms its support for the efforts of the Organization of American States and the United Nations to restore democracy and respect for human rights there, in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions. With regard to Cuba, we reaffirm our belief that the time has come for the economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba to be lifted. We hope that our two friends the United States and Cuba will resolve their differences peacefully. In this regard, we are encouraged by the recent dialogue between the two countries. Zambia attaches great importance to the role of regional organizations in addressing conflict situations. In this respect we note with satisfaction the increasingly active role played by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), including at regional and subregional levels, to address the root causes of conflicts and to prevent, manage and resolve them. In particular, in June of last year the OAU established a mechanism for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts in order for Africa to deal effectively with conflict situations on its own. For too long and too often, Africa has relied on external assistance to resolve its conflicts. The time has come for Africa to handle these situations resolutely. Conflicts continue to sap Africas energies, to waste its scarce resources and to retard its development. They must be eliminated in order to create 16 26th meeting 11 October 1994 an environment conducive to economic and social development. Zambia therefore appeals to the international community to contribute generously to the OAU Fund established to sustain the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution. International support is critical to the effective implementation of this important initiative. It is warranted by the fact that the United Nations, through the Security Council, exercises primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. It is now evident that peace and development not only are interrelated but are indivisible. This has been brought into prominence by the comprehensive reports of the Secretary-General entitled \"Agenda for Peace\" and \"Agenda for Development\". Indeed, in a number of conflict situations poverty and deprivation have been the underlying causes. There is, therefore, a compelling case to bring development and related issues to the centre stage of the United Nations, in order to promote the cause of peace in its most comprehensive perspective. We therefore welcome the Secretary-Generals preliminary report on the \"Agenda for Development\". My delegation fully supports the views of the Group of 77 on this subject, as reflected in its Ministerial Declaration of 30 September 1994. In particular, an Agenda for Development must be action-oriented and focus on the economic growth and development of the developing countries, especially the least developed amongst them. The Agenda for Development must strengthen the role of the United Nations in the area of international economic policy-making and coordination. flows, investment Africa is in economic crisis. It continues to face grave economic difficulties. Africa therefore needs a favourable international economic environment for the promotion of increased official development assistance, technological transfer, improved trade opportunities and better terms of trade. Africa further needs a viable and comprehensive solution for its huge debt burden. Such a debt strategy should include debt cancellation. In this regard, we fully support the positions of the Group of 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement. Zambia welcomes the conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the Agreement to establish the World Trade Organization (WTO) with effect from January of next the World Trade year. is our expectation that It General Assembly Forty-ninth session Organization will promote a non-discriminatory and predictable trading system and protect the rights and interests of the developing countries. In view of the increasing economic disparity between the developed and the developing countries, the WTO will not start on a level playing field. In this connection, it is the strong view of my delegation that the implementation of the Uruguay Round must be monitored constantly to ensure that the interests of developing countries are adequately protected. Compensation should be provided to those developing countries that are facing difficulties, particularly the least developed. Let me now address Zambias economic and political situation. On the economic front, we have followed, resolutely, a credible macro-economic reform programme whose main objective is to promote growth with stability based on an equitable allocation of resources. The main policy thrusts of the programme include strict control of the money supply and credit, with the aim of keeping inflation to minimal liberalization of the economy with greater reliance on market forces; and implementation of the privatization programme, through which previously State-owned enterprises are to be turned into private concerns in order to reduce direct Government participation in the economy. levels; Although these measures are expected to yield positive results in the long run, they have had some short-term negative effects, such as a drastic reduction in employment levels in the formal sector, a decline in income level, and a marked increase in both the level and the intensity of poverty, especially in the rural areas and among the vulnerable segments of the population. To cushion the poor from these adverse effects of economic adjustment, a social safety net has been created to assist those who lose their jobs or who are unable to meet their basic needs or obtain social services. It is going to be a long haul, but the Zambian Government is determined to rise above these challenges. I should be remiss if I did not express gratitude to all our development partners for the economic, financial and technical support rendered to our country. The support provided Zambia by our development partners will serve to underpin our structural adjustment programme, to which our Government remains committed. More importantly, such assistance will help to consolidate our democratization process, which we initiated in 1991 with the reintroduction of plural politics. In this regard, my delegation is pleased 26th meeting 11 October 1994 to assure the international community that Zambias democratization process remains firmly on course. There is a strong connection between the plan of action adopted at the Cairo Conference on Population, the World Summit for Social Development, to be held in Copenhagen early next year, and the World Conference on Women, to be held in Beijing, next September. The World Summit on Social Development will be an opportunity for the international community to renew its commitment and political will to effectively address a number of social and economic problems. The contribution made by women to development efforts is very clear, although it is often underestimated. We therefore look forward to Beijings programme of action, which we trust will ensure the full and equal participation of women at all levels of human activity. With regard to the environment, the international community is faced with the major challenge of giving practical effect to the concept of sustainable development To do this, effective as reflected in Agenda 21. international cooperation is vital. In particular, practical steps must be taken to provide access to appropriate technologies and to mobilize new and additional financial resources for the countries in need: the developing countries. My delegation therefore calls on the developed countries to fulfil the solemn commitments undertaken at the Rio Earth Summit. At the same time, the task at hand is global and must thus be shared globally. It involves individuals, non-governmental organizations, Governments and financial institutions. In the language of the Earth Summit, \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" (CONF.1 (Vol. I) Principle 7) is now imperative. community groups, integrating Zambia attaches high priority to environmental issues. As a reflection of our commitment, we have formulated a National Environmental Action Plan aimed at our socio-economic development plans. We have taken deliberate measures to increase the level of public awareness of environmental issues, particularly through the active involvement of non-governmental organizations and community groups. environmental concerns into is of rights and My Government firmly committed to the promotion and fundamental freedoms. We believe that it is the duty and responsibility of all Governments to do so, regardless of their political, economic or cultural systems. protection human 17 General Assembly Forty-ninth session In the aftermath of the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights, we should work to implement its important recommendations. Accordingly, my delegation will support genuine efforts in this direction during the current session. My delegation welcomes the establishment of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the appointment of Mr. Jose Ayala Lasso to this high office. Mr. Lasso has already proven his suitability for the appointment, and we commend his important initiatives concerning human rights situations in Africa and elsewhere. My delegation also supports the strengthening of the United Nations Centre for Human Rights in Geneva. in Zambia, My Government has also established a Human Rights Commission, which is responsible for investigating alleged human rights violations including those committed prior to the reintroduction of plural politics in 1991. In the spirit of our policy of transparency, the Government will publish the Commissions findings in a report to be made available to the general public. Zambia is thus firmly committed to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to other relevant international covenants and instruments. In the area of disarmament and arms control, my delegation strongly supports efforts to accelerate the elimination of nuclear weapons and to conclude a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We also fully support the review and extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which is scheduled to take place next year. However, we share the view that any extension of the NPT should be linked to progress on nuclear disarmament and to the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Zambia welcomes the significant progress achieved in the Geneva negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We further the case for a convention on conventional weapons and welcome the introduction of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms with a view to promoting transparency and confidence-building. support Zambia welcomes the successful conclusion during the the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly, of agreement relating to the implementation of part XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which opened the way for the Convention and its provisions. the universal acceptance of Let me now turn to the United Nations itself. As we meet in this session on the threshold of the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, we have to recognize that the fundamental meaning of the United 18 26th meeting 11 October 1994 that Nations Charter has remained unchanged; that the United Nations has undergone periods of both triumph and disillusionment; the United Nations is still an international organization for the people as well as of the people and it is therefore supposed to be a democratic institution. It is now time to reflect on a United Nations that will serve mankind for another 50 years after 1995. It will have to be a new United Nations, one which will suit the exigencies of the twenty-first century. It will be necessary to sharpen the mechanisms that were established to give effect to the declared principles and purposes of the Charter. It is only by going through this metamorphosis that our Organization will be able to adapt to a changed and changing environment, to new demands, new opportunities and new challenges. In this connection, my delegation is of the considered view that expansion of the membership of the Security Council is extremely important. Regions of the world, such as Africa, that are not represented at the level of permanent membership should be so represented. It will, therefore, be incumbent upon those regions to agree on which country or countries should represent them as permanent members. Apart from dealing with the Security Council, we must fashion the United Nations in such a way as to accord a central role to issues of the development of the developing countries. The Economic and Social Council should therefore be attuned to meeting this challenge. We would like to see a stronger Economic and Social Council with a mandate adequate to coordinate the policies of all development programmes and activities, as well as the activities of including the Bretton Woods institutions, for the promotion of sustained economic growth and development. the specialized agencies, to economic, environmental We now live in a world in which there has been a major recasting of international relations ranging from political to humanitarian issues. In this new atmosphere, the United Nations is the linchpin of our collective security, the repository of our hope for progress and prosperity. In this atmosphere, the United Nations has no greater contribution to make in the service of its ideals than to help the world find its way from the era of fear from which we are emerging into a time of hope and progress for all mankind. We wish this great creation more success for the betterment of the entire world. General Assembly Forty-ninth session "}}
