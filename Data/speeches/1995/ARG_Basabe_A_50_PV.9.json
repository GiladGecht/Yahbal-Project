{"speech":{"0":" In exercise of the right of reply, having heard the comments of the delegation of the United Kingdom the Argentine Republic wishes to confirm the views expressed by our Foreign Minister, Mr. Di Tella, this morning in the general debate. in his statement Mr. Kamal (Pakistan): We have heard the statement of the representative of India and his utterly fallacious and baseless allegations against Pakistan. Let us examine the points he made, beginning with the reference to Kashmir as an integral part of India. The incontrovertible fact is that Jammu and Kashmir is not a part of India. Kashmir is a disputed territory, and has been recognized as such by the United Nations for the last 47 years. This is substantiated in Security Council resolutions, United Nations maps and official documents of the United Nations all substantiate this. Security Council resolutions clearly determine that the final disposition of the State of Jammu and Kashmir will be made in accordance 9th plenary meeting 27 September 1995 the people expressed through the with the will of democratic method of a free and impartial plebiscite conducted under the auspices of the United Nations. Kashmir remains on the agenda of the Security Council. The Secretary-Generals annual report on the work of the Organization affirms that the dispute of Jammu and Kashmir has to be resolved. The oldest United Nations peace-keeping operation, the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), has been stationed along the Line of Control since 1949. Indian leadership itself is on record as accepting the disputed nature of Jammu and Kashmir. The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, stated that India had left the question of the final solution to the people of Kashmir and that it was determined to abide by that decision. The allegation that Pakistan was somehow responsible for the non-implementation of resolutions of the Security Council and of the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP) is false and unsubstantiated. The question of demilitarization applied to the Jammu and Kashmir territory as a whole, and not to that of liberated Jammu and Kashmir alone. When the time came for the withdrawal of Indian troops, India wriggled out of its commitment by offering many excuses. Sir Owen Dixon, the United Nations mediator, was constrained to report insisting on conditions which made the holding of a fair and free plebiscite impossible. India also frustrated the efforts of Dr. Graham, Sir Owen Dixons successor. India was not interested in any plebiscite and was determined to hold on to Kashmir. India was that Then, towards the end of 1950, in contravention of Security Council resolutions, India took steps for the total integration of Kashmir by convening the so-called Constituent Assembly. Thus, right from the beginning, it was India which stalled the implementation of Security Council resolutions. Then India blames Pakistan for territorial ambitions in Kashmir. Pakistan has no territorial ambitions in Kashmir. It is India that has demonstrated the worst example of territorial ambition in Kashmir by illegally occupying the territory and brutalizing its people for 47 years. 51 9th plenary meeting 27 September 1995 of the border with the sole purpose of committing terrorism and sabotage in Pakistan. It has also been implied that Jammu and Kashmir is somehow a bilateral dimension. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Simla Agreement of 1972 neither altered the status of Jammu and Kashmir as a disputed territory nor changed the international character of the issue. Nor does it prevent Pakistan from taking up the issue at international forums, particularly the United Nations. India has always repulsed Pakistans efforts to start serious negotiations on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with Security Council resolutions and even the Simla Agreement. India starts each round of bilateral negotiations with the condition that Pakistan should accept its illegal occupation in Jammu and Kashmir as a fait accompli. The so-called elections touted by India are the most blatant subterfuge used to legitimize its illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir. How can the people of Jammu and Kashmir express their will with Indian military and paramilitary forces brutalizing the people of Kashmir and the entire State machinery manipulating a stage-managed farce of elections? starts India always talking about elections in Kashmir under international pressure. The entire Kashmiri leadership have rejected any elections. They have declared that such elections would not be a substitute for the plebiscite promised to them by the United Nations. Reference has been made to events in Karachi. Pakistan is strongly committed to the promotion and protection of human rights. The Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mohtarama Benazir Bhutto, has spearheaded the campaign for universal human rights as a basis for democratic institutions, national unity and socio-economic development. Pakistan, however, has never emulated Indias supercilious posture in claiming that the human rights situation in our country is perfect. Pakistan has never General Assembly Fiftieth session In August 1994, From time to time Indian leaders and generals have threatened to cross the Line of Control and occupy Azad, Kashmir. the Indian Prime Minister threatened to complete the unfinished task of regaining Azad, Kashmir. After burning down the Charar-e-Sharif shrine and mosque complex in Kashmir in May 1995, Indian Cabinet Ministers and leaders vowed to teach Pakistan a lesson. This is territorial ambition in its quintessential form not Pakistans moral, political and diplomatic support for the oppressed people of Kashmir under Indian subjugation. The Indian representative also tried to denigrate the freedom struggle of Kashmir as a terrorist movement. This is an age-old ploy of the colonial masters to justify their stranglehold over forcibly occupied territories. If we were to accept then most into the category of freedom movements would fall terrorism. That is why the United Nations clearly differentiates between acts of terrorism and the legitimate struggle of people under alien domination and foreign occupation for their national liberation. the perspective of the oppressor, Indian allegations of Pakistans abetment of terrorism from across the border are patently absurd. Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Since 1990 Pakistan has time and again proposed the stationing of impartial international observers along the Line of Control. Last year the Foreign Minister of Pakistan proposed to the President of the Security Council the expansion of UNMOGIP on both sides of the Line of Control. India rejected all these constructive proposals. This speaks eloquently of its allegations. the propagandist nature of Unless India agrees to a stronger international mechanism for monitoring the Line of Control, all its claims about cross-border terrorism will need to be treated with the contempt that they deserve. In fact, India today is itself probably the largest terrorist State in the world. Over 600,000 Indian troops in Kashmir are involved in the most abhorrent manifestation of State-sponsored terrorism in the world. So much for the reference to peacetime locations of Indian troops! Its State machinery has been unleashed not only in Kashmir, but its neighbouring States. Pakistan, too, has been a favourite target of its intelligence agencies. in all In the recent past, Indian terrorists have killed thousands of people in Pakistan. No city is safe from their terror. Fifty terrorist camps are operating on the Indian side 52 General Assembly Fiftieth session claimed to be a paragon of perfection. Human rights violations in Pakistan are committed by individuals and not by the State. In Kashmir, on the other hand, what we are witnessing is a pattern of massive, systematic and consistent violations of human rights committed in pursuance of a well-planned State policy. Tens of thousands of people have been killed by Indian security forces. 9th plenary meeting 27 September 1995 Finally, I come to the reference to unfortunate hostages in Kashmir. Pakistan condemns all acts of hostage- taking wherever they occur. Pakistan forthrightly condemns the inhumane kidnapping of Western tourists by an unknown group, the Al-Faran. All evidence clearly points to the fact that this barbaric act of hostage-taking is a crude and cynical ploy by Indian intelligence agencies to discredit the legitimate struggle of the people of Kashmir. The All Parties Hurriyet conference, an association of 34 Kashmiri political parties and groups, has condemned this act and demanded the release of hostages. The kidnapping of the individuals and three successive actions from an area with an enormous Indian troop concentration, the hostage-takers constant contact with the outside world and the Indian authorities through telephone and radio communications â€” all these facts raise strong suspicions about Indian complicity in masterminding this incident of hostage-taking. The international media have also reported intriguing evidence that Indian authorities are controlling the hostage-takers. immediate In conclusion, let me reiterate that no amount of obfuscation by India in Jammu and Kashmir, a territory recognized as disputed by this body, can bail it out of its present quagmire. India has reneged on Security Council resolutions on Kashmir to which it was a party. Over 600,000 Indian troops are now brutalizing the peaceful people of Jammu and Kashmir, but they cannot crush their resolve to win freedom from Indian subjugation"}}
