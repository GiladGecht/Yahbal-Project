{"speech":{"0":" Allow me to congratulate Mr. Freitas do Amaral on his election as the President of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly. My Government the wealth of his experience and abilities will prove vital at this crucial crossroads as we search for new and innovative mechanisms and structures to enhance the effectiveness of our Organization to meet the challenges of the coming century. is convinced that Allow me also to pay tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cote dIvoire, for the ability and commitment that he showed in presiding over the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We further wish profound appreciation of the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and to commend him for his untiring efforts to ensure the effectiveness of our Organization. express our to The multifaceted challenges that our global community will continue to face in the period ahead, and the opportunities that exist — more than at any time in the past — to promote equity and justice in a more harmonious world will require a thorough review of General Assembly Fiftieth session paradigms, methods and institutions that have functioned for the past 50 years. Indeed, different realities from those now prevailing inspired the founding of the United Nations in 1945 and shaped its operational mechanisms in the subsequent decades. The situation now is very much changed, if not altogether new. 28th plenary meeting 11 October 1995 Cairo, Copenhagen and Beijing, aimed at environmental preservation, the reduction and elimination of poverty, and the empowerment of women, cannot be realized enhanced without these institutions. The new drive towards their increased integration is therefore both appropriate and timely. concerted efforts of the The membership of the Organization itself has undergone phenomenal change to increase almost fourfold. Moreover, while the threat of a major international confrontation has receded with the end of the cold war, a host of other problems, including an upsurge in inter-State conflicts, terrorism, growing poverty and marginalization of vast segments of humanity in the developing countries as well as within affluent societies, are coming to the fore. It is apparent that these problems and realities will require novel theoretical and institutional approaches. international None of these ideals can come to fruition without the essential prerequisite of peace. Representing a nation and people that have suffered the agonies of war and conflict for almost the entire lifetime of this Organization, my Government cannot underrate the efforts and priorities that the United Nations must accord to the prevention and resolution of conflicts. Past failures and inadequacies can only reinforce the collective resolve of our global community and destabilization and not to let down wronged parties. aggression of to check forces It is in this context that my Government welcomes the debates that have been provoked by the recommendations of the independent working committee and other interested parties on the future of the United Nations. Let me further underline that, as one of the new Member countries of the United Nations, we are gratified to rejoin the world community of States and impart our views on its future, especially as we have had the added advantage of gauging its operations from without for most of the past 50 years. We share the view of many Member States on the imperative of restructuring the decision-making bodies of the United Nations — particularly the Security Council, in a manner that ensures adequate representation of its diverse components and interests. The process of restructuring should not, moreover, consist of mere enlargement through the inclusion of a number of potential candidates as permanent members through some selection criteria of financial and economic clout, population size and other similar factors. As we all agree, the issue is more profound and transcends a simple numbers game. We hold that serious thought must be given to devising a suitable arrangement that guarantees the proper representation of our global community in its rich diversity and that is amenable to periodic adjustments to accommodate inevitable changes in a dynamic world. In the same vein, we welcome the emerging consensus over rationalizing the development agencies and institutions of the United Nations by eliminating overlapping functions and mandates, and integrating these institutions into more powerful and authoritative bodies. The numerous platforms unanimously adopted at the international Summits in Rio, And yet we cannot hide our disappointment at the indecision and wavering we see over sending clear signals to defuse potential time-bombs and conflicts that are brewing. The age-old folly of arming belligerent and aggressor States in pursuit of narrow commercial and other mundane continues unabated. This anomalous left-over of the cold-war years must surely be rectified, as it is the first step that we must take in our quest for global peace and as we devise elaborate mechanisms for conflict prevention, management and resolution. interests If I have dwelt somewhat at length on what we aspire to see in the invigorated Organization in the decades to come, this is due to my sincere belief that the tone we set here collectively will have far greater influence in shaping the future of our planet than the isolated measures and endeavours we undertake in our individual countries. Allow me now, to briefly touch on issues of direct importance to my country and our subregion. After three decades of agonizing war, my Government is today fully engaged in healing the wounds of war, rehabilitating a devastated country and institutionalizing the rule of law. The constitution-drafting process, hinged on popular participation in all is progressing at a satisfactory pace and according to the schedule envisaged. its phases, We are also doing our utmost to contribute, together with our sisterly partners, to the creation of a climate conducive to subregional cooperation and collective security on our part of the continent, which has seen much turmoil and commotion in the past. The precarious 17 General Assembly Fiftieth session situation in Somalia and the problems posed by the destabilizing policies pursued by the National Islamic Front (NIF) regime in the Sudan only indicate the enormity of the tasks, which need persistent and concerted efforts by all regional and international actors concerned. 28th plenary meeting 11 October 1995 the second phase of The recent document signed in regard to the implementation of the peace agreement between the Palestinian and Israeli parties can only inspire confidence in all of us that this long-drawn- out conflict is heading towards a satisfactory resolution at long last. We trust that these measures will contribute towards a comprehensive settlement of the conflict in the Middle East. In conclusion, I wish to restate our firm belief and hopes that our Organization will find the insight and inner strength to reinvigorate itself to meet the challenges of the next century. I can only reiterate my Governments firm commitment to play its small and modest part to advance the ideals that bind us together"}}
