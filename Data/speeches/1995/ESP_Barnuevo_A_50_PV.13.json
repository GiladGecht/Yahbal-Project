{"speech":{"0":" The Spanish delegation feels duty-bound to exercise its right of reply. for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of My delegation would like to refer to the mentions of the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla contained in the statement made here today by the Prime Minister and Minister the Kingdom of Morocco. Such references are not in keeping with reality, since those are Spanish territories, whose citizens are represented in the Spanish Parliament with the same rights and under the same conditions as their compatriots, and it is not possible to establish any parallels with other situations which are quite different in nature. Such references are not appropriate, since they are not relationship which exists in keeping with the overall between the Kingdoms of Spain and of Morocco, bilaterally as well as in the region as a whole, to which we both, as neighbours, belong. Mr. Kamal (Pakistan): I am speaking in exercise of the right of reply because the Foreign Minister of India made a reference in his statement this morning to Jammu and Kashmir as a State in India. Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed territory and Pakistan is a party to this dispute. To describe the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir as a State in India is totally fallacious and a distortion of the facts as they are known to the United Nations. The relevant Security Council resolutions clearly determine that the final disposition of the State of Jammu and Kashmir will be made in accordance with the will of the people, expressed through the democratic method of a free and impartial plebiscite conducted under the auspices of the United Nations. The Indian claim that Kashmir is an integral part of India is therefore untenable and incorrect. Only a week ago, the spokesperson of the Indian External Affairs Ministry, while commenting on the United 13th plenary meeting 29 September 1995 Nations Secretary-Generals offer of mediation on Kashmir, said that India remained fully committed to the resolution of the Kashmir issue peacefully, in accordance with the Simla Agreement. If Jammu and Kashmir was a part of the Indian Union, why would India appeal to the Government of Pakistan “to demonstrate sincerity in finding a peaceful solution to the Jammu and Kashmir problem”? Why would the Secretary-General want to offer his good offices on an Indian province? Or why would it be raised in international forums? The fact of the matter is that Jammu and Kashmir is an internationally recognized disputed territory. The Indian Foreign Minister also described terrorism as the “black plague” of our times, and we fully agree. But he went on to say that it is specious logic to say that one mans freedom-fighter is another mans terrorist. The fact is that the United Nations has consistently underlined the distinction between terrorism, on the one hand, and the legitimate struggle of peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation for the realization of their right to self-determination and national liberation, on the other hand. The latter is exactly the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, where for the past 47 years an oppressed population has been struggling to seek liberation from the Indian yoke. Its struggle is not a movement for secession; is not a violation of the territorial integrity of a country: it is the realization of a promise that was made to the people of Jammu and Kashmir by the United Nations and agreed to by India and Pakistan. No amount of distortion of history or attempts to cloud the issue by sidetracking it can change the irrefutable validity of Security Council resolutions freely accepted but subsequently reneged on by India. it Terrorism, in any case, should be condemned and opposed in all its forms and manifestations, including State-sponsored terrorism targeting people living under alien domination and foreign occupation. The United Nations should not appease the States that are involved in organized terrorism against the people of occupied territories. With 600,000 armed troops in Jammu and Kashmir terrorizing an innocent people, we are witnessing State-sponsored terrorism at its worst. Reference was also made by the Foreign Minister of India to the unfortunate incident of hostage-taking in Kashmir. We have already had occasion to point out in this forum the mounting evidence of Indian complicity in this gruesome act. This time again, as in past instances, foreign tourists have been taken hostage by a group unknown to all, including to the 34-member All-Parties 37 General Assembly Fiftieth session Hurriyet Conference. Al-Faran, a group which manages to operate with immunity in one of the most heavily soldiered regions of the world, a group which manages to stay in regular communication and contact with the Indian authorities, without their being able to trace it — all this is only part of the circumstantial evidence of a plot masterminded by Indian intelligence agencies to denigrate the Kashmiri struggle for freedom. No one here is gullible enough to accept Indian professions of piety. the Finally, Indian Foreign Minister said that democracy alone is not a guarantee against colonial rule or wars. We agree. In fact, here is the so-called largest democracy in the world responsible for the largest operation of State-sponsored terrorism and the most gruesome human rights violations seen over the past 50 years. Mr. Gaussot (France) (interpretation from French): Some opinions expressed today on nuclear tests, in the framework of the general debate, make it necessary for my delegation to set forth certain facts once again. First of all, our underground nuclear tests are in no way detrimental to the environment; eminent scientists have demonstrated this on many occasions. Secondly, the final tests, eight at the most, that France finds it necessary to carry out are not contrary to its commitment to exercise the utmost restraint. Restraint is not the same thing as prohibition. Furthermore — and this point is fundamental — far from being contrary to the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty, the last programme of tests now under way serves the achievement of that goal. Indeed, because of this final programme of tests, to be concluded before the end of May 1996, France will be in a position to commit to such an international agreement without any reservations. itself Furthermore, the completion of our tests will make it possible for my country to argue resolutely for what is known as the zero-option — that is, for a treaty prohibiting any nuclear-weapons testing or any other nuclear explosion, at any level. France, as the Assembly knows, was the first nuclear Power to commit itself to this essential option, and my delegation is pleased to see that several States have welcomed that commitment. The most recent French tests thus come within the context of, and must be seen from the point of view of, the impending conclusion of a truly significant treaty, namely a treaty that does not envisage any exception or allow for any circumvention. 38 13th plenary meeting 29 September 1995 Ms. Murugesan (India): The representative of Pakistan does not tire of wasting the valuable time of this Assembly. The unfounded and baseless allegations he has just made are only a reflection of the frustration that is axiomatic when truth is pushed under the carpet and an attempt is made to build an edifice on falsehood. Or is this latest outburst reflective of a guilty conscience? It is no doubt a mixture of the two. I am intrigued that the representative of Pakistan has chosen to exercise his right of reply in response to the statement made earlier today in the Assembly by the leader of my delegation. I do not recall, nor I am sure can anyone else in this Assembly recall, any reference to Pakistan in our statement today. We can therefore draw the only possible logical conclusion: that Pakistan is actively engaged in interfering in the internal affairs of India. Blaming India is so juvenile a reaction to Pakistans own culpability in sponsoring, supporting and sustaining terrorism in its most brutal form in India that it deserves no response. Such an allegation from a State that has turned its armed might against its own people is ironic, to say the least. The only impediment to dialogue between India and Pakistan is Pakistans continued export of terrorism in its most brutal form into India. Pakistans greed for Indian territory has fuelled three wars which, by the acknowledgement of Pakistans own generals, were started by Pakistan; and since 1989, that greed has fuelled Pakistans proxy war in Jammu and Kashmir through terrorism. This is the distinction in Jammu and Kashmir between Self- determination here is predetermination by Pakistan. self-determination. terrorism and Pakistan should be condemned by the international community as a sponsor of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations — cross-border, State-sponsored terrorism in India and Afghanistan, ongoing State terrorism against ethnic minorities in Sind, clear linkages to international terrorism such as the World Trade Center bombing, and several other incidents in the Middle East. The terrorist camps and schools run by Pakistan should be shut down. Our official spokesman stated on 21 September that in spite of the numerous provocations by Pakistan, the Indian security forces have exercised enormous restraint. There is no threat to peace and security in the region from the Indian side of the Line of Control or the international border. The Government of India hopes that General Assembly Fiftieth session the Government of Pakistan would demonstrate sincerity in finding a peaceful solution by eschewing sponsorship of terrorism across the Line of Control and returning to the negotiating table for a meaningful dialogue. Mr. Kamal (Pakistan): Once again we have heard one of Indias representatives trying to hide their own guilt behind non-relevant arguments. We dismiss their allegations with the contempt that they deserve. The central and only point that has to be addressed is that of the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir. Can the Indian representative deny that the United Nations, of which this Assembly is a constituent part, duly recognizes Jammu and Kashmir as a disputed territory? Can she deny that the Security Council resolutions clearly state that the future of Jammu and Kashmir is to be determined by a plebiscite, to be held under the auspices of the United Nations? Can she deny that the Security Council resolutions remain fully implemented? Can she deny that the concentration of Indian troops in Kashmir is the largest such concentration since the Second World War, with a ratio of one Indian soldier to every three adult male Kashmiris? Can she deny the systematic killing, torture and rape of civilians by Indian troops or their homes, villages and townships, as documented by so many human rights the torching of operative valid and until they are 13th plenary meeting 29 September 1995 organizations? Can she deny the excellent means of communication that exist between Indian security and intelligence forces and the Al-Faran outfit, which has taken innocent Western tourists hostage and beheaded one of them? Can she deny that it is India that has opposed the proposal by Pakistan for an increased strengthening of the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) along the Line of Control, so that these facile allegations of theirs can be monitored by the United Nations itself? Can she deny, finally, that despite repeated proposals by Pakistan, is India that has rejected the offer for an independent, neutral international fact-finding mission to visit both sides of the Line of Control, to establish once and for all what is the true state of affairs in this disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir? it These are the relevant questions, to which we, and this Assembly, want clear answers from the Indian delegation. They are entitled to a reply to a statement in right of reply. We challenge them to come on record to answer these questions in front of the Assembly. Mr. Surie (India): I have no intention of further dignifying the representative of Pakistan by wasting the time of this Assembly. However, I would only urge Pakistan to look deep within itself and cleanse itself of the devil that lurks within. Jammu and Kashmir is, and shall remain, an integral part of India. This is an immutable fact"}}
