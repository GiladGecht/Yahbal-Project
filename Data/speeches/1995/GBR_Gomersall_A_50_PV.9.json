{"speech":{"0":" My delegation would like to respond briefly to the remarks made by the Foreign Minister of Argentina concerning the Falkland Islands. My delegation welcomes the Foreign Ministers accent on the increasing cooperation between the United Kingdom and Argentina which characterizes our bilateral relationship. On the question of the Falkland Islands, as our Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, stated in the Assembly last year, we have no doubt about Britains sovereignty over the Falkland Islands and other British dependencies in the South Atlantic, sovereignty which rests upon the firm historical foundations and upon the inalienable right of the Falkland Islanders to self-determination, which they have exercised on repeated occasions in democratic elections. We must heed the wishes of the people concerned. The elected representatives of the Islanders, who visited the United Nations for the debate in the Committee of 24 last July, clearly expressed their view that the Argentine claim to the Falklands was unjustified and should be dropped. The Minister refers to respect for the Islanders. We should respect their right to determine their own future. Argentina and Britain are however succeeding in cooperating on the basis of the agreements which they reached in Madrid on 15 February 1990. Today we have signed an important agreement on cooperation over offshore activities in the South West Atlantic. This clearly states that it will not affect the positions of either side on the sovereignty issue. My Government sincerely hopes that the progress which has been achieved will be built on and developed for the benefit of the South Atlantic region as a whole. This represents, in my Governments view, the most appropriate means of securing a bright and peaceful future for all the populations concerned. Mr. Surie (India): An extraordinary statement was made against my country earlier today, couched in abusive language and consisting entirely of falsehoods. Normally we would not have considered it necessary to dignify it with a response. However, the statement was made by the Foreign Minister of Pakistan, and therefore it is necessary for us to set the record straight. 9th plenary meeting 27 September 1995 In his long tirade against India, the Foreign Minister of Pakistan inadvertently included one sentence that was absolutely true: it was indeed India that brought Kashmir to the Security Council. We asked the Council to take a stand against aggression on Indian territory. The Councils resolutions made it absolutely clear that before any further steps could be taken Pakistani forces had to withdraw from the territory they had forcibly occupied in Jammu and Kashmir. To this very day, that has not happened. The occupying forces in Jammu and Kashmir, in the terms of Security Council resolutions, are those of Pakistan. In Jammu and Kashmir, the people exercised their right of self-determination in 1947 and, as in any democracy, they have chosen their own Governments in successive elections, together with the rest of the Indian electorate. As in any democracy, those who represent the people are the only ones who can negotiate on their behalf. Therefore, it is our view that the first step in Jammu and Kashmir is to hold fresh elections in which anyone who is eligible under the terms of the Indian Constitution can participate. Those elections will establish just who truly represents the Kashmiri people and their wishes. At the moment, those who claim to speak for the people of Jammu and Kashmir are self-appointed, and their authority flows not from the freely expressed wishes of all the people but from the barrels of guns supplied to them by Pakistan. Quite understandably, therefore, Pakistan is not prepared to have the bluff of its proteges called, and has therefore done everything possible to thwart the democratic processes in Jammu and Kashmir. the Government of Instead, Pakistani-sponsored terrorism, which it unleashed in Jammu and Kashmir six years ago, has been taken to new extremes. The shrine at Charar-e-Sharif was burnt down by the mercenary Mast Gul, who claimed credit for this outrage, returned to Pakistan and was feted in the Pakistan media and by Pakistani Government television for his crimes. The Foreign Minister of Pakistan disingenuously claims today that the concentration of the forces at the border makes it impossible for the militants to slip in from Pakistan. Mast Guls return to Pakistan, after burning the Charar-e-Sharif shrine, shows how easily Pakistan has managed to slip in arms and terrorists to continue the violence in Jammu and Kashmir. The Government of Pakistan claims it only offers moral support to the Kashmiris. Pakistans moral support 49 General Assembly Fiftieth session has already killed 20,000 Kashmiris. The armaments our security forces have recovered from Jammu and Kashmir are only a small percentage of what has been sent by Pakistan, but could equip four infantry divisions. If this is moral support, we shudder to think what Pakistans immoral support would have done. Despite these provocations, India certainly does not have the slightest interest in hostilities with Pakistan. The Pakistan Foreign Minister talks of threats of war emanating from New Delhi. This is a figment of his imagination. The Government of India have repeatedly, at the highest level and in bilateral discussions, emphasized that India desires nothing but peaceful relations with Pakistan. The Government respond. Nevertheless, though we are disappointed that Pakistan does not wish to normalize relations or have bilateral talks, we have noted that their military leaders, who continue to be the most leadership, have repeatedly said they anticipate no conflict. influential section of refused their of Pakistan has to There is no threat of war in our region, certainly not from India. Our troops are in peacetime locations. They are deployed in Jammu and Kashmir to defend the innocent civilian population of the State against the depredations of the terrorists. The Pakistani Foreign Minister made an astonishing claim linking India to the Al-Faran group, which has taken several Western tourists hostage and brutally killed one of them. It is recognized by all Governments which have been drawn into this latest unsavoury episode that Al-Faran is a front for the Harkat-ul-Ansar, a terrorist organization based in Pakistan, financed by it and operating on its behalf. Al-Farans direct link to Pakistan is established by the fact that they are asking for the release of three Pakistani terrorists in Indian custody. Pakistan weeps about an arms race. This is ironic coming from a country that in the 1980s diverted arms given to the Afghan Mujahideen and in the 1990s, when that source ran dry, turned to the world for more arms. Through a recent amendment by the Congress of the United States, Pakistan will have several hundred million dollars worth of weaponry added to its inventory. It acquired missiles several years ago, which it claims it has kept nailed down in their boxes — like its own people. Indias concentration is on the economic and social development of its people. We recognize that this must be our highest priority. We believe that if the Government of Pakistan also believes in this objective it should be possible 50 9th plenary meeting 27 September 1995 for us to work jointly for peace in the region. If we agree on these objectives, there is no need for any third party to persuade us to be good neighbours. The Foreign Minister of Pakistan talks about Security Council resolutions on Kashmir as sacrosanct. In the same statement, speaking on Bosnia and Herzegovina, he describes the arms embargo on Bosnia, imposed in accordance with a resolution of the Security Council, as illegal. The Security Council cannot be deemed sacrosanct only when it suits Pakistan. The difficulties we have had with Pakistan are not unique. The Government of Afghanistan formally complained to the Secretary- General in a letter dated 14 September 1995 about armed Pakistani interventions in their country, in collusion with mercenary groups, which Pakistan has organized, financed and trained, but which the Government of Pakistan, with its usual attachment to falsehood, claims to disown. Taliban in Afghanistan and Al-Faran in Jammu and Kashmir are both creatures of the Government of Pakistan. Having perfected the art of State-sponsored terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, and in Afghanistan, Pakistan has now unleashed terror on its own people. Karachi is in flames because the Government of Pakistan is practising a brutality on its own people with which the victims of Pakistani terror in Kashmir are all too familiar. This, of course, is in a way a long-standing Pakistani tradition. In 1971, State terror unleashed by Pakistani forces in what was then part of their country led to 3 million deaths, a scale of extermination and genocide that compares easily with anything unleashed under fascism. I want to make one point absolutely clear. Nothing Pakistan can say or do, no violence, no outrage, no falsehood repeated a thousand times over, will change the fact that Jammu and Kashmir is, and will continue to be, an inalienable part of India. The Government of India will do everything necessary to defend the rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir to live in the peace and security which other Indian citizens enjoy. The Government of India hopes that the Government of Pakistan will demonstrate sincerity to find a peaceful solution by eschewing sponsorship of terrorism across the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir and returning to the negotiating table for a meaningful dialogue, as urged by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization. General Assembly Fiftieth session As I began by saying, this statement in exercise of the right of reply has been forced upon us. It is a foregone conclusion that, Pakistans flow of invective and falsehood being inexhaustible, a further outpouring will follow. We do not intend to waste the time of the Assembly by responding to any further provocations. Mr. Ladsous (France) (interpretation from French): Some delegations have again today mentioned the question of nuclear tests. Particularly critical terms were used by two of them, going so far as to condemn actions by France and China. France protests the judgements thus made, judgements not in keeping with an objective assessment based on the facts. In this regard, I should like to repeat the completion by France of the current programme should be considered for what it is, namely, the completion of a series of tests, limited to eight at most, that will be completed before the end of May 1996. Our goal remains to conclude as soon as next year a truly significant treaty that would ban any nuclear-weapon test or any other nuclear explosion. that I repeat, the completion of our test programme is not doing damage to the environment. It is in keeping with the law and with the commitments made by France. Extreme restraint does not in any way mean a ban. Finally, this programme will allow France to become an advocate of the most satisfactory, most stringent, version of the test-ban Treaty. Mr. Basabe (Argentina) (interpretation from Spanish): In exercise of the right of reply, having heard the comments of the delegation of the United Kingdom the Argentine Republic wishes to confirm the views expressed by our Foreign Minister, Mr. Di Tella, this morning in the general debate. in his statement Mr. Kamal (Pakistan): We have heard the statement of the representative of India and his utterly fallacious and baseless allegations against Pakistan. Let us examine the points he made, beginning with the reference to Kashmir as an integral part of India. The incontrovertible fact is that Jammu and Kashmir is not a part of India. Kashmir is a disputed territory, and has been recognized as such by the United Nations for the last 47 years. This is substantiated in Security Council resolutions, United Nations maps and official documents of the United Nations all substantiate this. Security Council resolutions clearly determine that the final disposition of the State of Jammu and Kashmir will be made in accordance 9th plenary meeting 27 September 1995 the people expressed through the with the will of democratic method of a free and impartial plebiscite conducted under the auspices of the United Nations. Kashmir remains on the agenda of the Security Council. The Secretary-Generals annual report on the work of the Organization affirms that the dispute of Jammu and Kashmir has to be resolved. The oldest United Nations peace-keeping operation, the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), has been stationed along the Line of Control since 1949. Indian leadership itself is on record as accepting the disputed nature of Jammu and Kashmir. The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, stated that India had left the question of the final solution to the people of Kashmir and that it was determined to abide by that decision. The allegation that Pakistan was somehow responsible for the non-implementation of resolutions of the Security Council and of the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP) is false and unsubstantiated. The question of demilitarization applied to the Jammu and Kashmir territory as a whole, and not to that of liberated Jammu and Kashmir alone. When the time came for the withdrawal of Indian troops, India wriggled out of its commitment by offering many excuses. Sir Owen Dixon, the United Nations mediator, was constrained to report insisting on conditions which made the holding of a fair and free plebiscite impossible. India also frustrated the efforts of Dr. Graham, Sir Owen Dixons successor. India was not interested in any plebiscite and was determined to hold on to Kashmir. India was that Then, towards the end of 1950, in contravention of Security Council resolutions, India took steps for the total integration of Kashmir by convening the so-called Constituent Assembly. Thus, right from the beginning, it was India which stalled the implementation of Security Council resolutions. Then India blames Pakistan for territorial ambitions in Kashmir. Pakistan has no territorial ambitions in Kashmir. It is India that has demonstrated the worst example of territorial ambition in Kashmir by illegally occupying the territory and brutalizing its people for 47 years. 51 9th plenary meeting 27 September 1995 of the border with the sole purpose of committing terrorism and sabotage in Pakistan. It has also been implied that Jammu and Kashmir is somehow a bilateral dimension. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Simla Agreement of 1972 neither altered the status of Jammu and Kashmir as a disputed territory nor changed the international character of the issue. Nor does it prevent Pakistan from taking up the issue at international forums, particularly the United Nations. India has always repulsed Pakistans efforts to start serious negotiations on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with Security Council resolutions and even the Simla Agreement. India starts each round of bilateral negotiations with the condition that Pakistan should accept its illegal occupation in Jammu and Kashmir as a fait accompli. The so-called elections touted by India are the most blatant subterfuge used to legitimize its illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir. How can the people of Jammu and Kashmir express their will with Indian military and paramilitary forces brutalizing the people of Kashmir and the entire State machinery manipulating a stage-managed farce of elections? starts India always talking about elections in Kashmir under international pressure. The entire Kashmiri leadership have rejected any elections. They have declared that such elections would not be a substitute for the plebiscite promised to them by the United Nations. Reference has been made to events in Karachi. Pakistan is strongly committed to the promotion and protection of human rights. The Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mohtarama Benazir Bhutto, has spearheaded the campaign for universal human rights as a basis for democratic institutions, national unity and socio-economic development. Pakistan, however, has never emulated Indias supercilious posture in claiming that the human rights situation in our country is perfect. Pakistan has never General Assembly Fiftieth session In August 1994, From time to time Indian leaders and generals have threatened to cross the Line of Control and occupy Azad, Kashmir. the Indian Prime Minister threatened to complete the unfinished task of regaining Azad, Kashmir. After burning down the Charar-e-Sharif shrine and mosque complex in Kashmir in May 1995, Indian Cabinet Ministers and leaders vowed to teach Pakistan a lesson. This is territorial ambition in its quintessential form not Pakistans moral, political and diplomatic support for the oppressed people of Kashmir under Indian subjugation. The Indian representative also tried to denigrate the freedom struggle of Kashmir as a terrorist movement. This is an age-old ploy of the colonial masters to justify their stranglehold over forcibly occupied territories. If we were to accept then most into the category of freedom movements would fall terrorism. That is why the United Nations clearly differentiates between acts of terrorism and the legitimate struggle of people under alien domination and foreign occupation for their national liberation. the perspective of the oppressor, Indian allegations of Pakistans abetment of terrorism from across the border are patently absurd. Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Since 1990 Pakistan has time and again proposed the stationing of impartial international observers along the Line of Control. Last year the Foreign Minister of Pakistan proposed to the President of the Security Council the expansion of UNMOGIP on both sides of the Line of Control. India rejected all these constructive proposals. This speaks eloquently of its allegations. the propagandist nature of Unless India agrees to a stronger international mechanism for monitoring the Line of Control, all its claims about cross-border terrorism will need to be treated with the contempt that they deserve. In fact, India today is itself probably the largest terrorist State in the world. Over 600,000 Indian troops in Kashmir are involved in the most abhorrent manifestation of State-sponsored terrorism in the world. So much for the reference to peacetime locations of Indian troops! Its State machinery has been unleashed not only in Kashmir, but its neighbouring States. Pakistan, too, has been a favourite target of its intelligence agencies. in all In the recent past, Indian terrorists have killed thousands of people in Pakistan. No city is safe from their terror. Fifty terrorist camps are operating on the Indian side 52 General Assembly Fiftieth session claimed to be a paragon of perfection. Human rights violations in Pakistan are committed by individuals and not by the State. In Kashmir, on the other hand, what we are witnessing is a pattern of massive, systematic and consistent violations of human rights committed in pursuance of a well-planned State policy. Tens of thousands of people have been killed by Indian security forces. 9th plenary meeting 27 September 1995 Finally, I come to the reference to unfortunate hostages in Kashmir. Pakistan condemns all acts of hostage- taking wherever they occur. Pakistan forthrightly condemns the inhumane kidnapping of Western tourists by an unknown group, the Al-Faran. All evidence clearly points to the fact that this barbaric act of hostage-taking is a crude and cynical ploy by Indian intelligence agencies to discredit the legitimate struggle of the people of Kashmir. The All Parties Hurriyet conference, an association of 34 Kashmiri political parties and groups, has condemned this act and demanded the release of hostages. The kidnapping of the individuals and three successive actions from an area with an enormous Indian troop concentration, the hostage-takers constant contact with the outside world and the Indian authorities through telephone and radio communications — all these facts raise strong suspicions about Indian complicity in masterminding this incident of hostage-taking. The international media have also reported intriguing evidence that Indian authorities are controlling the hostage-takers. immediate In conclusion, let me reiterate that no amount of obfuscation by India in Jammu and Kashmir, a territory recognized as disputed by this body, can bail it out of its present quagmire. India has reneged on Security Council resolutions on Kashmir to which it was a party. Over 600,000 Indian troops are now brutalizing the peaceful people of Jammu and Kashmir, but they cannot crush their resolve to win freedom from Indian subjugation"}}
