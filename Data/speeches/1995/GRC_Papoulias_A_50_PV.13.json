{"speech":{"0":" Allow me at the outset to extend to the President of the General Assembly the warmest congratulations of the Greek Government on his election to the presidency at this historic fiftieth session, which is a well-deserved tribute to his personal qualities and his distinguished international career. I would also like to thank His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy for the highly constructive and efficient manner in which he performed his duties as President of the General Assembly during its forty-ninth session. I wish to take this opportunity to address my sincere congratulations to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who is striving with courage, energy, political will and vision for a new world in which law and ethics will prevail, and for the restructuring of the Organization, so that it may meet the challenges of our time. He has our full support in his efforts to fulfil his mission. Let me also welcome Palau, the new Member that has been admitted to the United Nations this year. Its presence among us is a renewed expression of our Organizations desire to welcome in its midst all those States that undertake the commitment to adhere to the General Assembly Fiftieth session purposes and principles set out Charter. in the United Nations The Foreign Minister of Spain, in his capacity as President of the Council of the European Union, delivered a statement earlier this week on behalf of the Union and its member States. My Government fully subscribes to the content of that statement and of the memorandum of the Union. I would like, however, to elaborate further on some issues which are of particular interest to my country. This fiftieth session of the General Assembly provides us with an opportunity, not only for an annual exchange of views between the States Members of the United Nations on the state of international affairs, but also for the celebration of a milestone in the life of the Organization. This celebration should not, however, be just a token tribute to the great undertaking of 50 years ago. It is only natural that, on this occasion, Governments should endeavour to analyse the successes and failures of the United Nations over five decades, to ask themselves whether we have come closer to fulfilling, in the practice of international relations, the principles proclaimed in the Charter, and to look to the years ahead in order to try to chart our new priorities in a rapidly changing world. This Organization was brought into being by the vision, the hope and the determination of men and women first hand the lethal dangers of who experienced at nationalism, economic depression, freedom and devastating war — men and women who realized the need to create mechanisms that would allow States to embark upon a collective effort in dealing with a wide range of complex international issues. lost Looking back over the 50 years since the guns of the Second World War fell silent, one notes with satisfaction the valuable work performed by the United Nations as a forum for debate on matters of international concern, and as a centre for harmonizing the activities of States in the economic, social, cultural and humanitarian fields. The United Nations has played a vital role as a framework for the historical process of decolonization, by securing international recognition for the new countries and by helping them improve their economic and social conditions. It has defined human rights for the global It has defeated the shameful practice of community. apartheid. It has provided the basis for an intensive development of international law. It has monitored elections in countries where elections have seldom been held. It has assisted in the drafting of constitutions, and has trained 13th plenary meeting 29 September 1995 global indigenous police forces. It has moved forward consensus problems on the environment, the status of women, human rights, development and many other fundamental issues. disarmament, such as Furthermore, the specialized agencies of the United Nations system have achieved major successes in their different spheres of activity, and have provided invaluable humanitarian and other assistance in distressed areas of the world. Despite this creditable record, it is the shortcomings of the United Nations that receive the greatest attention. I will certainly not argue that the achievements of those past 50 years yield any ground whatsoever for complacency. However, while disappointment has been frequently expressed at the Organizations performance, no credible alternative is offered by those who criticize it. Moreover, little regard is given to the innumerable constraints under which it operates, as well as to the fact that it can be only as effective as Governments allow it to be. The United Nations has indeed structural deficiencies, which it urgently needs to overcome. But it is too often a useful scapegoat for the mistakes, the failings and the unfulfilled promises of Member States. The Secretary-General, in his highly acclaimed and very timely report entitled “Supplement to an Agenda for Peace'”, issued earlier this year, has underlined the great problems presented to the United Nations by the new generation of post-cold-war conflicts, for which the Organization was obviously unprepared. He has pointed out that, for instance, in the framework of its peace- keeping activities, the Organization has had, in some cases, to juggle efforts to combine mandates, including the use of force under Chapter VII of the Charter, with the basic principle of neutrality and impartiality of the United Nations and the lack of adequate resources to effectively implement that mandate. In the same context, shortcomings in the unity of command which we have witnessed in the case of some peace-keeping operations have also contributed to undermining the effectiveness of United Nations action. The financial crisis in general has also been particularly debilitating as regards the activities of the Organization in all areas. The Secretary-General has often questioned the credibility of those Member States that support the ends, by actively participating in the decision- making process, but not the means, by failing to pay their assessed contribution. Nobody denies the fact that considerable progress can still be achieved with regard to 21 General Assembly Fiftieth session the effective use of resources that are already available. But unless the necessary financial means are provided, it would from the Organization. be folly to expect miracles Eliminating waste better management and accountability, essential though it may be, will never be a substitute for ensuring adequate and regular funding. inefficiency, through and in his report, The increasing resort to, and use, of sanctions regimes has brought to light another series of difficulties which have also undermined the credibility of the United Nations. As the Secretary-General pointed out the objectives for which specific sanctions regimes were imposed and the criteria for their lifting have not been clearly defined, or have seemed to change over time, as has been the case for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and Iraq. This situation is all the more worrying because experience has proved that the in the infliction of imposition of tremendous suffering upon vulnerable groups of the targeted country, rather than in the modification of the behaviour of its Government. sanctions results to be appropriately acknowledged, Furthermore, the role of those countries that shoulder the main burden of the implementation of the sanctions regimes, despite the considerable collateral damage which they suffer in terms of economic and social costs, needs, at last, their contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security is, in some cases, no less important than that of troop-contributing countries. It should be clear that if, in the long run, the difficulties of those Member States that have the misfortune to be neighbours of the targeted countries are not dealt with in a satisfactory way, inter alia, through the appropriate implementation of Article 50 of the Charter, then general support for the use of sanctions as an effective instrument will not be easily maintained. for Regrettably, one would have to acknowledge that the primary purpose of the United Nations — that of establishing a pattern of world order and international security — has been achieved to a much lesser degree than had been expected, or is indeed required by the growing needs of the international community. The threat and the use of force are still a recurrent feature of international relations, contrary to the expectations raised in 1945. The territorial integrity or the sovereign rights of States are frequently threatened or compromised by the practice of power politics, the purposes and principles that govern our Organization. in contravention of 22 13th plenary meeting 29 September 1995 In this context, allow me to observe that a charter is of value in so far as each member that subscribes to it conducts itself in accordance with the commitments it has undertaken of its own free will, without guile or reservations. It is also of paramount importance that the United Nations should not be perceived as resorting to double standards when it comes to military aggression and other blatant violations of international law. always The guiding principle of Greek foreign policy is the establishment of good-neighbourly relations with all countries of the region, on the basis of respect for international law, national sovereignty and human rights, and on non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. This principle has constituted the cornerstone of our foreign policy and applies fully to our relations with neighbouring Turkey. It is the sincere wish of my Government that Greek-Turkish relations be normalized, on the basis of the principles of international law and the relevant treaties, and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, the Helsinki Document and the Charter of Paris for a New Europe. Greece has never raised any claims against Turkey. On the other hand, we have made it absolutely clear of sovereign rights, which we are compromising our determined to protect by all legitimate means. categorically international that we reject idea any Unfortunately, Turkey is following a different approach in its policies vis-a-vis our country. To cite just one example, I wish to refer to the resolution adopted on 8 June 1995 by the Turkish National Assembly, authorizing the Turkish Government to use military force in case Greece exercised its legal right to expand its territorial waters to 12 nautical miles, according to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The said resolution was obviously endorsed by the Turkish Government, since it was forwarded to the Secretary- General on 23 June 1995 in a letter addressed to him by the Permanent Representative of Turkey to the United Nations. Turkey is in fact attempting to intimidate Greece into forfeiting a right acknowledged to all signatory parties, by article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982, and already exercised by a large number of States. Furthermore, it is beyond any doubt that the above-mentioned resolution constitutes a direct violation of Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter of the United Nations, which stipulates that General Assembly Fiftieth session 13th plenary meeting 29 September 1995 refrain in their international “All Members shall relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State”, way for bilateral cooperation for their own benefit, as well as for the sake of peace, cooperation, stability and prosperity throughout the Balkans, which has been so affected by the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. as well as of many similar provisions of international treaties and conventions. It is self-evident that an essential improvement of Greek-Turkish relations presupposes a just and lasting solution of the Cyprus question and the re-establishment of international legality in Cyprus. Unfortunately, during the last 21 years, the Turkish forces, defying a series of United Nations resolutions, have occupied a large part of Cyprus, despite the assiduous efforts of the Secretary-General. Their continuing presence has resulted in the division of the island by force, the brutal violation of human rights and freedoms, and the systematic plundering of the islands cultural and religious heritage. The Greek Government strongly supports the efforts of the Secretary-General with a view to a just and viable solution of the Cyprus problem, on the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions, including the most recent one, resolution 939 (1994), which calls for a bi-communal and bi-zonal federal State of Cyprus with single sovereignty and international personality and single citizenship, with its integrity safeguarded. The independence and territorial Greek Government believes that the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, which was further promoted by concrete actions taken by the Union in the course of 1995, will create conditions that would make it possible to tackle the current deadlock and, thus, assist effectively the Secretary-Generals efforts for the reversal of the unacceptable status quo. the prospect of One should also bear in mind that no progress towards a settlement is possible as long as the Turkish occupation forces remain on the island. The Greek Government considers the proposal for the total demilitarization of the island, put forward by President Clerides, as most constructive. It also feels that it is imperative that countries which are in a position to back the efforts of the Secretary- General and wish to do so should exert the necessary pressure so that the side which is responsible for the impasse will be forced to abide by international law and United Nations resolutions. The signing of the Interim Accord, on 13 September 1995, in New York, constitutes an important step towards establishing a new era in relations between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It also paves the We do hope that this preliminary significant step in the relations between the two countries will lead to a definite settlement of the dispute over the name, which constitutes the main difference existing between them and which will be dealt with in the context of further negotiations, conventional commitment of the parties concerned and the relevant Security Council resolutions. in accordance with the Greece attaches great importance to its relations with Albania. For this reason, we constantly follow a policy of good- neighbourliness and cooperation with that country and continue to support, in many ways, its efforts to promote political and economic reforms and thus contribute to the establishment of a modern and democratic society. Greece has been offering substantial economic support to Albania, which has enabled it to face the many difficult problems that arose after the former regime was overthrown. Today, Greek investments in Albania continue to contribute substantially to the countrys economic development and to the strengthening of its social stability. to the positively contributing Furthermore, a large Greek minority lives in Albania, countrys development. Under the previous regime, this minority was subjected to persecution and harsh treatment. Greece is convinced that the Greek minority in Albania constitutes a bridge of friendship between the two countries and helps further their rapprochement and cooperation. For this reason, we believe that the human rights of the members of that minority should be fully respected, so that they are able to stay in their homeland and live there in a safe environment. Moreover, they should be proportionally represented in the administration, the State institutions and the armed forces, and be allowed to exercise their religious and educational rights freely and fully. Unfortunately, notwithstanding some improvements, considerable restrictions continue to apply to the free exercise of these rights, particularly in the field of education. We the Albanian Government, in conformity also with its international sincerely hope that 23 General Assembly Fiftieth session commitments, will secure full respect for the human rights of the Greek minority. During the current year, the tragedy of the former Yugoslavia has continued to unfold relentlessly, imposing tremendous suffering and hardships on the civilian population. Greece, as a country neighbouring the former Yugoslavia, has been directly subjected to the negative consequences of this bloody conflict, as regards both its economy and its security. My country has always advocated that, as has already been pointed out by the presidency of the European Union, a fair and viable solution to the conflict in Bosnia can be found only by political means, and not on the battlefields. This is why from the beginning of the crisis we have spared no effort to ensure that all the parties involved moved in the direction of trying to promote a peaceful settlement, in cooperation with our European partners and Russia, which has played, and is to play, a significant role in this issue. Furthermore, the Greek Government fully supports the current diplomatic initiative and the ongoing negotiating process based on the Contact Group plan. Recently, there have been encouraging developments things in the former regarding the future shape of Yugoslavia. The parties have begun to show signs of rapprochement and willingness to talk. Thus, we warmly welcome the Basic Principles, agreed in Geneva on 8 September 1995, and the Further Basic Principles, agreed three days ago in New York, which are very important steps on the long and difficult road to peace. Much remains to be done, but if the parties display the necessary political will and with the assistance of the international community a comprehensive and viable peaceful settlement should no longer be a fictitious objective, whose attainment would take a very long time. Greece, for its part, is ready to contribute to the fulfilment of this objective through the good relations that it has developed with all the parties involved in the conflict. Furthermore, my country, fully aware of the intricacies of the Balkans and having actively participated in the initiatives for regional economic cooperation, will do its utmost, both on a national basis and in the framework of the European Union, the reconstruction of the former Yugoslavia. to promote efforts aiming at Concerning the situation in the Middle East, Greece considers as a matter of utmost importance the early and unimpeded implementation of the recent Erez and Taba Agreements and the speedy conclusion of the talks on 24 13th plenary meeting 29 September 1995 redeployment and elections, together with the solution of the two outstanding problems, namely security for all, and social and economic development. We welcome the signature yesterday in Washington by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) of the interim agreement on the second stage of Palestinian autonomy, which constitutes additional proof of determination and political courage. We congratulate the Israeli Government and Chairman Arafat on their commitment to peace. Greece believes that the international community must exert consistent efforts, in which we are willing to actively participate, aiming at the creation of a solid basis for the political and economic survival of the Palestinian National Authority, thereby providing a source of hope for the Palestinian people. Greece is of the view that the peace process could be substantially promoted if the States of the region directly involved in it joined forces with those actively participating, and we welcome all recent indications to this effect. The peoples of the region should be guaranteed a secure life, within internationally recognized and safe boundaries. We urge the implementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978) on Lebanon. Greece, which has actively participated in the Middle East peace process since it began in Madrid, will continue to offer full support and assistance to the bilateral and multilateral negotiations towards a comprehensive, final and just peace. Greece believes that an increase in the number of members of the Security Council has become an imperative necessity. Such an increase, which should be moderate so as not to undermine the effectiveness of the the current number of Councils action, must reflect States that are Members of the United Nations, the the new international situation and an realities of equitable distribution among all existing regional groups. While recognizing that any formal definition of criteria for new permanent members could not be easily formulated, we consider this category should be selected from among States that exert a major influence in world affairs and are in a position to make an essential contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security. that new members of General Assembly Fiftieth session emphasize Greece welcomes the indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the commitment made by the States parties to its universalization and full implementation. We of strengthening the review process and adopting a set of principles non-proliferation and disarmament. We also stress the need to complete without delay comprehensive and verifiable treaties to ban nuclear- weapon tests and to cut off the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices. and objectives importance the for We are deeply concerned at the continued dangers posed by the excessive transfer of conventional arms, and we support putting the United Nations Register fully into effect. Furthermore, the continuing injuries to civilians caused by anti-personnel mines demonstrate the need to strengthen multilateral controls in this regard. Growing economic and social gaps breed violence. The need to bridge the differences between rich and poor, both between nations and within nations, is of the utmost importance for our efforts and opportunities to preserve peace. This fundamental truth was recognized and stressed by the founders of the United Nations and, subsequently, by all members of the Organization, who pledged to “employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples”. changing needs of In responding to the the increasingly interdependent world economy, we have to reinforce the coherence and effectiveness of the competent international institutions and to complete without delay our consideration of the “Agenda for Development”, thus setting out a new impetus to international cooperation in this field and defining the particular contribution expected of the United Nations system. In this There is an increasing realization worldwide that in major denials of human rights, which breed antagonisms and deep resentments, there lie the seeds of international discord as surely as in the clashes of economic rivalries and territorial ambitions. regard, Greece strongly condemns all forms of discrimination and intolerance, and reaffirms its full support for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and his coordinating role throughout the United Nations system, as well as for the strengthening of the Centre for Human Rights. The principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and also those of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, as well as of the other international acts and 13th plenary meeting 29 September 1995 instruments, should guide the actions of all Member States in this respect on a daily basis. Industrialization and the technological revolution, while bringing benefits to the human race, have also given rise to side effects, namely the problems of the devastation of the natural environment. In this context, the importance of meeting the commitments we made at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, and the need to review and cannot strengthen be institutions overstressed. and responsible supporting international organizations that focus on environmental issues, will be vital in maintaining and increasing the momentum for the protection and the improvement of the environment. environmental management, appropriate, national them, where Strengthening for important their most Troops and civilian personnel engaged in United Nations peace-keeping and humanitarian activities have been carrying out tasks under conditions of extraordinary personal risk, and very often at the expense of their own lives. I would like to condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the abhorrent and unacceptable harassment of and attacks against United Nations peace-keepers, to whose relentless courage and determination we pay tribute. I should also like to stress the need for measures which will ensure their security, including the early entry into force of the recently adopted Convention for the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel. These past 50 years of United Nations existence have been a time of unparalleled human advancement and of the fundamental enlargement of human expectations. As I see it, the Organization, which has done so much to give voice to those expectations, to take the lead in bringing them ever closer to realization. it will be the principal task of in the strengthening of Greece, as a small country, has always had a strong vested interest the common capacity to deal with threats to international peace and security and, in general, in the success of the United Nations.
