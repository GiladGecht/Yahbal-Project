{"speech":{"0":" With 15 October 1995 only a few days away — the first anniversary of the restoration of the democratic process in Haiti — I am pleased on behalf of the Government and people of Haiti to extend our greetings to the international community gathered here and our wishes for a long life to the United Nations, which is playing an ever more decisive role in the lives of our peoples. I should like to extend my warmest congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on his election to the presidency of this fiftieth session of the General Assembly and extend my best wishes for his success in the exercise of his important duties. I should like also to pay a well-deserved tribute to His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cote dIvoire, for the wisdom and ability he showed in conducting the work of the forty-ninth session. Allow me also to congratulate Mr. Boutros Boutros- Ghali on his effective management as Secretary-General of our Organization. His thorough knowledge of the issues and his proposals contained in the Agenda for Peace and the Agenda for Development have enabled him to make a significant contribution to the thinking on reforming the Organization with a view to making it more capable of facing the challenges of the twenty-first century. This session of the General Assembly coincides with our commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. More than any other, this session is destined to affect the history of our Organization because of the reflection this anniversary will certainly inspire with regard to its future. Fifty years have elapsed since 51 States, including my own, the Republic of Haiti, recognizing the absolute need to take collective action to work for peace, development and social progress, decided to found the United Nations. From its inception, the United Nations has been a focus of the aspirations and hopes of peoples world wide for a more peaceful future and a more promising tomorrow. Throughout the half century of its existence the Organization has exerted great efforts to achieve the goals set forth in the Charter. It has addressed a broad range of complex international problems and has, in many cases, been able to find a satisfactory solution to them.

Corrections should be submitted to original speeches only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and be sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned, within one month of the date of the meeting, to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, Room C-178. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum. General Assembly Fiftieth session Thus, the United Nations has distinguished itself in the decisive role it has played in the decolonization process, in the strengthening of international security and in the restoration of peace in many parts of the world. It has also contributed to the development of law. Through a series of global conferences, it has progressed towards an international consensus on such world problems as the environment, population, human rights, the status of women, the rights of the child, sustainable development and many other fundamental questions. international Quite recently, United Nations activities in support of peace have taken on added scope with the increase in peace-keeping operations, some of which have met with outstanding success — operations in Cambodia, in El Salvador or in my own country, Haiti, where the joint action of the United Nations and the Organization of American States brought about a return of constitutional order and thereby provided eloquent testimony to this success. In that connection allow me on behalf of the people and Government of Haiti to express to the international community our gratitude for its support and its contribution to the restoration of the democratic process in Haiti. Thanks to you, Haiti now has a valid peace; political stability is on the verge of becoming a reality; and the security of Haitian society is a virtual fact. You helped us to emerge from a period of turbulence and to create in our country conditions favourable to peace and development, replacing the repression under which we had lived for the three years of coup detat. Once again, I wish to express the deep gratitude of the Haitian people to the great family of the United Nations and to each of the nations that, in one way or another, provided support for the return of constitutional order. In this connection I should like to share with the Assembly the work our Government has accomplished since its restoration. One year after the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to Haiti, significant progress has been achieved in all spheres of national activity. The Government has made it a point of honour to draw the Assemblys attention to the that fact the rights of all Haitians are scrupulously respected, freedom of expression and association is guaranteed, our institutions have resumed their normal functioning, the scheduled legislative and municipal elections have been carried out, and insecurity in both towns and countryside has noticeably diminished. 2 25th plenary meeting 9 October 1995 the demobilization of In achieving that result the Government had to adopt measures that were vigorous but welcomed by the vast majority of the population. Among others, I would cite the dismantling of the corps of section heads and their auxiliaries, the armed forces pending approval by Parliament of their dissolution, the establishment of a new national police force in keeping with the wishes expressed in the 1987 Constitution, the creation of the National Magistrature School and the National Penitentiary Administration. All of those measures enjoyed the wholehearted assistance of the United Nations Mission in Haiti, which has been an invaluable partner in the restoration of democratic processes in Haiti. To strengthen the populations confidence in the process of national reconciliation the Government has set up a National Commission for Truth and Justice to shed light on the atrocities committed during the three years of coup detat, and that Commission has made great progress in its work. In addition, the Government has understood the need to go further in making reparations and combating the acceptance of impunity. In a Decree of 29 September 1995, the Government decided to allocate 20 per cent of the budget of the Ministry of Justice to victims of the coup detat and to provide them with legal aid in bringing cases criminals. Such measures demonstrate a determination to put an end to impunity and to render justice to those to whom justice is due. prosecuting and Thus, we are firmly and irreversibly committed to democracy. There are still some problems to be solved, but no one can question the enormous progress accomplished since 15 October 1994. The struggle for the establishment of a democratic State in Haiti continues with ever-greater determination. However, there can be no viable economic development. In Haiti, the link between democracy and development is fundamental, affecting as it does the very survival of our nation. democracy without sustained In this connection the Haitian Government has given pride of place to two major approaches that define the national development policy, namely, regeneration of the space some 8 million inhabitants will share before the end of the century, and universal education. Natural resources — restored, revived and protected from continuous and uncoordinated overexploitation — must be managed by citizens, families and communities, General Assembly Fiftieth session who shall learn to acquire know-how, to share knowledge, to spread information, and to tap both the vast, exciting stockpile of human knowledge and their own rich national culture. Through formal and non-formal education and by using all training and information technologies, we must meet from elementary education to command of the high technology appropriate to our development. the needs of our population, budgetary, fiscal, monetary, public-administration, It is easy to see that, because of their importance, those two fundamental decisions will involve redefining all sectoral and non-sectoral policies and programmes. It is along these lines that we shall define policies of direct State management, public- investment, public-enterprise management, credit and other policies, as well as policies that demand a degree of partnership with various sectors of the nation. When the conditions are met we will be able to engage in a process of restoring social balance through an improved sharing of national wealth. From there we shall move gradually to narrow the gap between the individual incomes of different groups. If the State uses the means and the tools at its disposal, especially fiscal and credit measures, it should be possible to hasten this movement. With the support of the international community our nation is working with high hopes to build a State based on law and to restore the fabric of our national economy. The example of Haiti, which I have just described, along with other successes achieved by the United Nations over the past 50 years, must not hide the reality of a world far from fully achieving the objectives of peace and social progress for all that were the dream of our forerunners. Despite the end of the cold war, which has lessened the probability of nuclear conflict, the Earth continues to be an arena of murderous conflicts that cause unspeakable suffering and vast humanitarian tragedies. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda, Burundi, Georgia and Liberia to name but a few, wars born for the most part of ethnic, religious or tribal antagonisms seem to resist any attempt at solution by the international community. It is true that there has been significant progress with respect to certain crises, such as those of the Middle East and Angola, and my Government joyfully welcomes this. But the persistence of such conflicts dampens our hopes for the establishment of a lasting peace. In that context, I want to recall the threat that mankind still faces from stockpiles of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. My delegation hopes that the nuclear-weapon States will keep the promises they made at 25th plenary meeting 9 October 1995 the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), with respect to ridding the planet of nuclear weapons. The conclusion of a nuclear-test-ban treaty, next year we hope, would be an important step towards that goal. One of the ideas developed by the Secretary-General in his “Agenda for Peace” is that peace cannot be viable without development. It is acknowledged that a basic cause of instability and conflict throughout the world is increasingly flagrant social and economic disparities and the destitution afflicting a large part of mankind. In many speeches, the Secretary-General has said that the globalization of problems requires global solutions, whether in the sphere of the environment, migrations, development or international security. It is also time to adopt a comprehensive approach to the collateral effects of inevitable structural adjustment. A timid step in that direction was taken at the Halifax summit of the seven most highly industrialized countries, but what is needed most is greater participation by the countries of the South in the international economic system with a view to defusing the fearsome “social bomb” described at the Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development. have caused to damage significant Let us remember how vulnerable our countries — especially small island States — are to natural disasters. This year, the Caribbean region has been the victim of an unprecedented number of hurricanes and tropical storms, which the infrastructure of a number of countries, which have seen years of effort shattered in a few hours or less. We extend our sympathy to our brother countries, and appeal to the international community to mobilize all the resources needed for their rehabilitation. Clearly, small island States are not equipped to deal with such situations. Perhaps we should consider a multilateral instrument that could limit their effects on the lives and property of affected populations. In that connection, we welcome the “White Berets” initiative inspired by Argentina, of which Haiti was the first beneficiary. In a world where the burden of globalization in all of its forms is increasingly being felt, the need for a new global contract is becoming more and more imperative, as a means to guarantee international peace and security. At the present time, many countries, including my own, are not able to satisfy the most elementary needs of the their population. With the increasing majority of 3 General Assembly Fiftieth session globalization of markets, and the political, economic, financial and cultural environment of the world, some countries are achieving a degree of success, while other countries continue to slip towards deterioration. The result is that millions of men, women and children are living in subhuman poverty, without access to health care or to adequate nutrition. that sustainable development This is a timely occasion for our Organization to play its role as an instrument of solidarity and international cooperation, in keeping with the mandate that was conferred on it 50 years ago. The implementation without delay of the Copenhagen decisions would be desirable. It should be of concern that, otherwise, these situations would spill over national borders and become a source of destabilization on a world-wide scale. In that regard, let us recall is the process that guarantees economic, social, political and cultural progress for the present population, and survival with happiness, dignity, peace, democracy and justice for future generations. To the Bretton Woods institutions, we would say that structural adjustment programmes are useful only to the extent that they lead to actual development programmes based on growth, full employment and equity, designed and carried out primarily for the most disadvantaged classes of society. the benefit of This awareness, which implies the will to put forward a new global contract, also prompts us, on behalf of the Haitian Government, to call upon the relevant forums, not only to define and articulate once and for all the areas of common interest the Organization, but also to seek out the ways and means to release the financial resources necessary to make the actions of our Organization more relevant. in the various activities of In the context of increased interdependence, which is characteristic of national policies — especially those of third world countries — the instruments used by international institutions and bilateral agreements determine any experience of a certain scope. For that reason, it is not just support that we are requesting from our partners: we are asking them to share with us the experience of addressing these challenges. Let them have a stake and involvement — which is possible and even probable — in the redefinition of their own instruments, which should change if to the challenges which, for decades, have faced the worlds efforts to improve the world order. those instruments are to be equal We can understand that changes in institutions of a certain size may give rise to much reluctance. And we ask: 4 25th plenary meeting 9 October 1995 What are the risks to the international community if it to engages in an experiment sufficiently limited not frighten us, yet the desirability of extending it to more determining situations and bringing about a significant institutional change? sufficiently important to test for the Organizations budget Our Organization is at a decisive crossroads in its history. As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of its founding, we are faced increasingly with the problem of the financing of the operation of the system. From the experts reports, we have already learned that the core resources of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have shrunk by 15 per cent, and we have noted, with some fear, that contributions to various United Nations trust funds have been undergoing some decline for at least four years. In the long term, this process of regression in the area of financial contributions will constitute a definite threat to the various operations conducted by the United Nations system, whether it be in the field of peace-keeping or in the area of development activities properly speaking. These considerations prompt us to ask the question that concerns all of us on this fiftieth anniversary, the question of the reform of the United Nations system. At the dawn of a twenty-first century that is so filled with promise — but also so disturbing in certain respects — our Organization will increasingly be called upon to face certain major challenges in the fields of ecology, population, economics, information and the fight against organized crime. Faced with those daunting challenges, some of which are as yet unknown or unimagined, it is important to restructure and to strengthen the basic framework of this universal Organization. The strengthening of the United Nations structure should, we believe, be built around a legal, administrative and institutional reform. In that respect, my Government would ardently wish to see a reform of the Security Council, with respect both to its mode of operation, which should be more democratic, and to its membership, which should better reflect the diversity that characterizes the great family of the United Nations. In this regard, we invite all States to look into the most effective ways and means to cooperate with non- governmental organizations. We must acknowledge the fact that, increasingly, these organizations are serving as forums for reflection and initiatives in civil society and are becoming essential partners in the quest for a new world of more human and integrated development. General Assembly Fiftieth session One area of great concern to the Government of Haiti is the precarious nature of the present situation of many refugees, especially women and unaccompanied children, who deserve special attention. Also, I take this opportunity to state our increasingly resolute opposition to any forced repatriation of refugees in violation of international legal instruments that govern this question, including the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol. Discriminatory policies, racism and xenophobia will only inflame an already tragic situation which has long troubled our conscience. It is time for barbarism to give way to civilization and for respect for human rights to be enjoyed by all, men and women, without distinction. The Government of the Republic of Haiti supports the plan to create an international criminal court to give effect to the principle of individual criminal responsibility in cases of serious and unacceptable violations of human rights. My Government is deeply alarmed at the scale of the illicit production of, trafficking in and abuse of narcotics around the world. In order to protect ourselves against this scourge, it calls on producer and consumer States, transit countries and those laundering drug money to give their full support to the fight against this evil. Since the end of the cold war, a war that actually was only cold on the territories of the great Powers, the limited conflicts that seemed to go along with the inherent situation there have multiplied constantly. We must recognize that only the pretexts have changed. The real reasons for those conflicts, we repeat, are the maintenance of an excessively profitable trade in conventional weapons. Today, the standing of a nation is not measured, and should no longer be measured, by its economic power or its military arsenal. Today, a great nation must apply itself to solving the problems of its people and those of mankind as a whole. In 1945, 51 States created the United Nations, whose intrinsic purpose was to maintain international peace and security and to promote the economic development of all its Members. Fifty years later, as we take stock, the changes that have taken place in the international arena only bear out the validity of these ideals of the founding fathers. The celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is an occasion for us to recognize the capacities of this Organization and the need to reform it in order to turn it into an increasingly effective instrument that 25th plenary meeting 9 October 1995 can face the challenges of the twenty-first century to build a better world.
