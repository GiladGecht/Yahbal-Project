{"speech":{"0":" My delegation would like to exercise its right of reply in response to unwarranted references to East Timor made by the Foreign Minister of Portugal in his statement to the General Assembly earlier today. The content of that statement has led us to question Portugals sincerity and commitment in the ongoing tripartite dialogue under the auspices of the Secretary- General. General Assembly Fiftieth session It is to be recalled that during the fifth round of talks, held in Geneva on 9 January 1995, the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and of Portugal concurred on the need for both parties to exercise continued restraint in the interest of maintaining an atmosphere favourable to further progress. It must be emphasized that Portugal cannot on the one hand laud itself for its efforts to engage in constructive dialogue with Indonesia under the auspices of the Secretary-General and on the other hand continue to use every opportunity to launch campaigns of slander against Indonesia, including misrepresentations of the decolonization process of the Territory and of conditions prevailing in the province. It is preposterous to speak of “the illegal occupation of East Timor” and “the denial of the exercise of the right of self-determination of the people of East Timor”, while the historical facts confirm that the problems in East Timors history can be attributed to actions of Portugal. In August 1975, Portuguese colonial authorities precipitously abandoned the territory to civil chaos, strife and bloodshed. In fact, they practically instigated the civil war by clandestinely turning over arms and ammunition to one minority group, the Frente Revolucionaria de Timor Leste (FRETILIN). It would have been timely and appropriate for Portugal to have responded to the rights and primary interests of the East Timorese people at that time in history, to have heard their voices and to have implemented their wishes. themselves In the face of this, the East Timorese people rightly to decolonize themselves, assumed their inherent right considering any longer no decolonization covenant with the erstwhile colonial Power. This they did by choosing independence through integration with Indonesia in accordance with General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV). bound to We welcome the intra-East-Timorese dialogue, which has served as a forum for the leaders of the East Timorese to meet and contact each other in an atmosphere of peace and fraternity, after having been separated for almost 20 7th plenary meeting 26 September 1995 years. However, it should be pointed out that according to the terms of reference for the all-inclusive intra-East- Timorese dialogue, this will not in any way constitute a parallel negotiating track or be a substitute for the ministerial talks held under the auspices of the Secretary- General. Finally, Indonesia remains fully committed to the people of East Timor, including in terms of the promotion and protection of human rights, and supports them in their efforts towards building a prosperous future for their children and for themselves. Mr. Catarino (Portugal): I would like to reiterate here that Portugal has no interest in the question of East Timor other than its desire to see a recognition of the fundamental right of the people of East Timor to self- determination. It is our moral and historical duty as the administering State to work towards the achievement of that objective. According to resolutions of the General Assembly and of the Security Council, the process of decolonization was interrupted by the illegal invasion and occupation of the Territory by Indonesia. I would like to restate here our trust in the Secretary-General and in his mission of good offices, and our hope that the ongoing talks will lead not only to an improvement of the human rights situation in East Timor but also to the creation of a better atmosphere for the talks and to the ultimate goal of self-determination for the Timorese people. Mr. Samodra (Indonesia): My delegation would simply like to reiterate that both parties to the dialogue under the auspices of the Secretary-General should abide by their concurrence on continued restraint in the interests of maintaining the favourable atmosphere very much needed if we are to make further progress. We believe that Portugals pattern of, on the one hand, claiming that it is committed to dialogue with Indonesia and, on the other hand, continuing to upset the atmosphere by waging a campaign against Indonesia is not helpful. Mr. Catarino (Portugal): I would just like to recall that the present talks were undertaken on the initiative of Portugal. We are committed to the success of these talks. I reiterate what I have just said. Again, I wanted to say that the Secretary-General has our trust, and that we hope we will achieve progress in these talks"}}
