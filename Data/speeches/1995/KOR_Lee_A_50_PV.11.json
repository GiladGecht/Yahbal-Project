{"speech":{"0":" It is with great reluctance that I have chosen to intervene, owing to 11th plenary meeting 28 September 1995 the distortions in the statement about the Republic of Korea and the allegations made against it. Although I can afford to dismiss the statement of the representative in question, I feel bound to make the following point for the benefit of the representatives gathered in this Hall. With regard to the nuclear question, my delegation would like to draw the attention of the representative to the fact that last Friday, 22 September, in Vienna, the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) adopted one more resolution, by a vote of 74 to none, on North Koreas non-compliance with the IAEA safeguards agreement. It is our sincere hope that North Korea will abide by its obligations under the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and under the safeguards agreement that it concluded with the IAEA. At the same time, my delegation urges North Korea once again to come forward to hold a dialogue with the South for the Joint Declaration on Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. implementation of the prompt The protection of human rights has been, and continues to be, a top priority on my Governments agenda. Since the inauguration of the civilian government in 1993, in particular, a number of reform measures have been taken to enhance human rights in my country. The record of the protection and improvement of human rights in the Republic of Korea is well documented in many authoritative reports and studies, including those by major human rights watchdog organizations around the globe, and is also reflected in our continued membership in the Commission on Human Rights. Therefore, North Koreas attempt to denigrate the good name of Korea in the realm of human rights can only be scoffed at by the international community. I believe that the North Korean delegation has chosen the wrong subject, at the wrong time, in the wrong place, because the United Nations is a forum in which lies and distortions of the facts can be detected easily. Many representatives have been to my country and have seen for themselves how fully-fledged democracy has blossomed there. My delegation wishes to take this opportunity to cite briefly the June 1994 report of Amnesty International on the status of political prisoners in North Korea. A particularly alarming fact in the report was the disclosure of the names of a large number of political prisoners who are kept in detention centres across the country. It is 27 General Assembly Fiftieth session 11th plenary meeting 28 September 1995 thousands of prisoners are detained in believed that numerous concentration camps across North Korea and that over 430 South Koreans have been taken against their will to the North since the end of the Korean war. carefully and deeply the agreed framework between the DPRK and the United States, because no resolution of the Korean nuclear issue can be justified if this agreed framework does not implement it. According to an annual report on human rights by an authoritative organization, “the North Korean regime subjects its citizens to rigid control and establishes security ratings for each individual, which determines access to employment, schools, medical facilities and certain stores, as well as admission to the Korean Working Party. The regime permits no independent press or associations, and little outside information reaches the public, except that approved and disseminated by the Government”. Another striking piece of evidence of the miserable human rights situation in North Korea is the fact that over the course of one year, the number of defectors to my country from the North Korean lumber camps in Siberia has reached almost 60. If the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea is truly, as it has claimed, a “State where human rights are respected and surely guaranteed”, my delegation urges it to open its society and allow the international community to see firsthand the current state of its human rights situation. Moreover, we ask that detainees and individuals who have been separated from their families be allowed at least to communicate with their families and loved ones. Lastly, I will dismiss all other statements by North Korea, because we all know that, the unreasonable arguments they advance or any further attempts to mislead the international community, the Republic of Korea is a success in terms of democratization and economic prosperity, in which all Korean people can take pride. regardless of "}}
