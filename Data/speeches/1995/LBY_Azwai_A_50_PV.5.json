{"speech":{"0":" In speaking this morning of terrorism and the threat it poses to the lives of people, the United States Secretary of State mentioned sanctions imposed by the Security Council against my country because two of our nationals have been suspected of being involved in the Lockerbie incident. Mr. Christopher made the irrevocable judgement that my country had a hand in this tragic incident. This linking of my country with terrorism and the Lockerbie incident by the leading diplomat of the United States of America has been repeated on several occasions. 5th plenary meeting 25 September 1995 The United States indicts and condemns even before any trial. Members of this Assembly should know that that is the main reason why my country does not agree to the extradition of the suspects to either the United States or the United Kingdom. Both these countries are adversaries, and have repeatedly condemned the suspects before trial. My country has repeatedly condemned terrorism in all its forms. We have also declared our readiness to participate in any international effort aimed at combating and eradicating terrorism. The fact is that my country is a prime victim of terrorism. The United States itself has practised various types of terrorism against us, from the imposition of embargoes to military provocations in our territorial waters and overt aggression against our peaceful cities under the cover of darkness - let alone its sheltering of ungodly extremists trained in the United States to carry out acts of sabotage inside Libya, with the assistance of United States authorities. My country strongly supports the Arab League initiative for trying both suspects by Scottish judges in accordance with Scottish law at the International Court in The Hague. We are committed to having the suspects stand trial at that Court. We are also committed to pay any compensatory damages if awarded. We also reserve the right to sue the United States, the United Kingdom and the United Nations, if the suspects are acquitted, for compensation for the damages caused. If the 33 General Assembly Fiftieth session United States Secretary of State is serious about combating terrorism, he must accept this initiative, ask the Security Council to lift and revoke the unjust sanctions imposed on my country, end the American boycott, and start negotiating to find solutions to the problems between the two countries and normalize relations in the interests of both the Libyan and the American peoples"}}
