{"speech":{"0":" Allow me to congratulate the President on his election to his high office at the fiftieth session of the General Assembly. The Government and the people of the Republic of Malawi hold him and his great country, Portugal, to preside over the deliberations of the Assembly during this important session, as the United Nations commemorates its fiftieth anniversary, is an indisputable reflection of the recognition of his eminence by the international community. My delegation is confident that he will guide the deliberations of the Assembly to a fruitful conclusion. in high esteem. His appointment 21st plenary meeting 5 October 1995 At the same time, allow me to pay tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy of Cote dIvoire, who, in spite of the complexity of the issues and the difficult constraints which confronted the United Nations during his tenure, guided the work of the forty-ninth session with admirable skill, dignity and vision. It is indeed very difficult to have to speak today after His Holiness the Pope, lest those words which this morning flew up to high rafters of this building be forgotten. We in Malawi feel that perhaps it was our fate to be scheduled to speak after him. The Assembly will recall that the Pope talked about the moral aspects of nationhood, politics and relations between nations. The Assembly will also remember how he gave the word freedom a new dimension and meaning, saying that man will insist on it, whether small or big. The Assembly will also remember the moral responsibility he put upon the human being, both as an individual and as a member of the community of what is really a small planet. One need only fly a few miles up in the air from this little planet, which we call Earth, to see that we all really look like little rabbits dashing from one foxhole to another. However, as human beings, we also resemble God, our creator. To me it seemed as if our call to speak after him, this afternoon, was an occasion to try to strengthen what His Holiness the Pope left with us this morning. I The twentieth century is soon coming to an end. Historians will remember and record it as the century of three great phenomena, think. The first was the establishment of a power structure, as demonstrated by the rise of the great experiments: in democracy built on capitalism and respect for individual rights and the experiment in socialism based on a social contract for a community with a common purpose. The conflict of these ideas would lead to the emergence of what would dominate the worlds political ways during the first 45 years of this Organizations existence: the cold war. the experiment The second great phenomenon that the Pope referred to was the fall of the empires built by the European Powers from Asia to Africa and the proud rise of colonized people to independence. The third — and perhaps the most heart-rending — phenomenon of this century was that of racism. We saw it first in South Africa and later began to see it rearing its ugly head in the twilight of this century. 15 General Assembly Fiftieth session The curtain of this act finally falls on the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. Let us remember the joy and ecstasy with which the former colonial countries emerged into independence as Members of this body. What genius woke up to think of and, to found this idealism sustained it? Yet a dark Organization? What shadow haunted it in its growth; and now, as the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary is upon us, we somehow realize that perhaps the cold war, that Iron Curtain, was used by the great Powers, in the name of democracy, human rights and justice for all, simply to keep a balance of power. later, Malawi does not wish to seem bitter in expressing some of these thoughts; but 50, even in a mere human life, is the age at which soul-searching is important. Along with many others, Malawi sowed the seeds of its own gorgon 30 years ago — what the Pope referred to as the totalitarian totem. The pattern of Presidents-for-life and one-party autocracies bred a series of dictatorships supported by the interests of the cold wars great Powers. When perestroika knocked on the door, man heaved a sigh of relief. The cold war had ended. We in Malawi were not left behind. A new dawn broke in the land once described by Africa Watch as a place where silence rules. Last year Malawi stood up in this Assembly to declare proudly that a people cannot be kept down for ever by mans inhumanity to man. Thanks to the action of the United Nations, Malawi for independence, but for democracy. A referendum in 1993 and a general election, supervised by this world body and other friends, on 17 May 1994, gave birth to a new country. This is what the Pope referred to as “hope”. time not fought, this Today, a year and five months later, the four estates of democracy are taking root in Malawi. We now have an elective executive and a pluralist parliament with one of the most active and articulate oppositions slowly learning the complex art of debate and the art of give-and-take. In addition, we also have an independent judiciary protecting the bastion of the rule of law from which all human rights are protected and nurtured and we have an independent and free press. These four estates are almost a novelty in Malawi after 30 years of autocracy and a dictatorship responsible for the most vicious abuse of human life. Above all, it is important to remember that pathological hero worship is the price people pay for losing their self-respect. There is therefore cause to celebrate the 50 years of the life of the 16 21st plenary meeting 5 October 1995 United Nations — especially for Malawi for, from the land of the dead, we have come back to the land of the living. We are astonished, however, that at this moment of rebirth Malawi — and possibly other countries — seem to have been abandoned. Could this be what the Pope was talking about — the small nations — those which have power, whether it be economic or military? Where are those great friends of yesteryear, the great friends of the days of the cold war? We are astonished that as we are rejoicing in our new democracy they are now standing aloof watching our skeletons of hitherto silenced and abused citizenry feeding the flickering fires of democracy against the howling winds of poverty, hunger and disease. In this wider breakthrough of understanding in the universe, let us be thankful that on this tiny planet there is on the East River in New York a piece of land where people meet to discuss problems — some no bigger than an ant-hill and some larger — thankful that somewhere there is a little hill called Everest near Kathmandu where lilliputian human ants can crawl up and become heroes! After 30 Years of educated leadership we are still one of the least developed countries in the world, highest in the rate of illiteracy and the most highly indebted, but the most beautiful in nature and the one best qualified, perhaps, for a Marshall Plan. Malawi is among those countries in the world that have a high incidence of the HIAIDS infection. This pandemic has seriously affected the young and active the hub of segment of the population, which is development activity in all sectors of the national economy. We commend the untiring efforts of the World Health Organization and other institutions which, together with my Government, are actively engaged in tackling this pandemic. least for us, the entire issue of But perhaps I might add that, above all, the Conference on Women held in Beijing brought to the fore, at trying to understand the whole question of mans responsibility towards man and the importance of the idea of hope and sustenance in recognizing the role of women, for in my country 70 per cent of the economy and 70 per cent of human love and care and 70 per cent of all that makes a nation admirable is in the hands of women. How can one understand those who caused so many bombs and mines to be planted in Mozambique and Angola? How do they think of the women and children General Assembly Fiftieth session who wake up with new hope and who go to fetch water or plant their plantations and who find themselves blown up by those who should have cared much more than to play with such weapons — such utterly senseless weapons of destruction? Until recently my country hosted a large number of from Mozambique when that country was refugees experiencing civil refugee community, which peaked at over a million, has now decreased as refugees are returning home since the conclusion of a peace accord between the then warring FRELIMO government and the forces of RENAMO. strife. The size of the However, despite the ongoing repatriation of the refugees back to Mozambique, a strong legacy of environmental degradation is left behind. Deforestation, overgrazing, and the destruction of roads used by relief supply vehicles are some of the problems which resulted from the presence of the refugees. In addition, Malawi is playing host to a number of refugee communities from around Africa — from Rwanda and Somalia — although their numbers have grown nowhere near those reached by our brothers and sisters from neighbouring Mozambique. The Government of Malawi would like at this juncture to express its most sincere gratitude and appreciation for the kind and invaluable assistance received from the United Nations system, particularly through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), as well as from donor Governments and agencies, and non-governmental organizations at a time when we most needed help. Since the region experienced severe drought in the 1992 and 1993 crop seasons, with a mild recovery in 1993 and 1994, rainfall has continued to be erratic in southern Africa. The economy of Malawi, which is almost entirely agro-based, has been hard-hit, resulting in chronic food shortages. This season has not been any better. Once again, the country faces severe food shortages, which the Government has to meet through importing grain, mainly maize. Is this a test of our democracy? Can a democracy, even a classical Grecian one, grow on an empty stomach? Against this background is the programme for the alleviation of poverty, which the new Government of Malawi has enunciated in order to tackle the chronic poverty which it inherited from the previous regime. The poverty-alleviation programme seeks to target the rural 21st plenary meeting 5 October 1995 poor, who are in the majority as the primary beneficiary. A poverty-alleviation fund has been set up, along with a Malawi social action fund, which is a component thereof. The programme is multisectoral in approach and aims at promoting the education and health sectors among others. The Government has, introduced free primary school education and has also tried to increase the number of schools. in this regard, My Government would therefore like to thank the United Nations system and the donor community and the many other institutions in the private sector — especially the missionary sector — which have extended assistance in our development endeavours, for if our courage and hope had not been evoked by the Catholic bishops of Malawi I would not be speaking here today. I am a product of the 30 years of exile which totalitarianism imposed on my country. The success of the poverty alleviation programme therefore becomes a major aspect of our hopes and expectations. The new culture of tolerance has created a highly conducive climate for investment. We have therefore opened the door to prospective investors to come, explore and take advantage of the opportunities which exist in other areas such as tourism, irrigation, mining and other sectors of the economy. Malawi has noted with interest the ongoing efforts to reform the United Nations system. We have observed in particular the various proposals that have been put forward on the reform of the Security Council. The Security Council is, truly, an important organ of the Organization. It is therefore proper and fitting that an organ of such high standing should operate in an accountable and transparent manner. In addition, Malawi supports measures aimed equitable the existing representation in an effort international political configuration as well as the composition of the United Nations. at to reflect enhancing As Malawi consolidates genuine freedom and democracy it is pleasing to note that the rest of the southern African region has unwaveringly embraced this new culture of political pluralism and tolerance. More important, those countries which have for long been devastated by civil strife have either resolved or are in the process of resolving their misunderstandings. Malawi welcomes encouraging moves towards the demobilization of combatants of both the Angolan Government Forces and the National Union for the Total 17 General Assembly Fiftieth session Independence of Angola (UNITA) under the third United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III). We fully commend the invaluable role which we, the United Nations, are playing in Angola. In South Africa, the post-apartheid Government of President Nelson Mandela is now firmly in place. Incidentally, I am glad I can pronounce it properly, for it is not “apartheid” but “apart hate” — put apart and hate. The demise of “apart hate” brightened prospects for peace and cooperation in southern Africa. Malawi therefore calls upon the international community to render unflinching support to the new and emerging democracies in the region so that they do not slide back to anarchy and authoritarianism. to extend its Mission for The Malawi Government is concerned about the slow pace at which the identification of eligible voters is proceeding in Western Sahara. We appreciate the efforts of the United Nations the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) as a show of genuine commitment to resolving this long-standing issue. It should, however, be noted that without the commitment of the principal players in the matter the current efforts will all be in vain. We therefore call upon the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco to allow the United Nations Mission a free hand in its operations so that the deadline of January 1996 for the holding of a referendum can be met. Malawi has noted with a good deal of concern the horrendous massacres of innocent people in the Central African country of Rwanda. However, despite the continued existence of ethnic tensions, the efforts of the United Nations to ensure that peace finally descends upon this troubled area have not faltered. To this end, my Government earnestly commends the role played by the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), to which we have made a modest contribution of military observers as a demonstration of Malawis commitment to the restoration of peace. The militarization of the refugee camps outside Rwanda is a source of great concern to Malawi. We therefore call upon the international community to do its utmost to reverse the reported inflow of weaponry into the refugee camps, and appeal to the people of Rwanda to exercise political maturity in order to avoid a degeneration of the situation into the tragedy of yesteryear, especially when the mandate of UNAMIR expires on 9 December 1995. My Government is encouraged by the progress being made in the Middle East peace process. We commend the 18 21st plenary meeting 5 October 1995 courage and determination of the Government of the State of Israel as well as the leadership of the Palestine National Authority to move ahead. The two players deserve the unflinching support and applause of the international community to ensure that elements which are opposed to the peace process do not succeed. On the other hand, we have observed with remorse the tragedy which has unfolded in the countries of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Innocent civilians have been the most hurt in the shifting fortunes of war in the Balkan region. Understandably, the United Nations and the rest of the international community can play only a limited role in the resolution of the conflict. My Government, therefore, calls upon the principal players in the region to cooperate with the international community in finding a lasting solution to the conflict. It is the hope of my Government that the Korean people on both sides of the thirty-eighth parallel will sustain and strengthen contact, with the aim of breaking the existing impasse in the reunification of the divided peninsula. In the same vein, my Government favours any efforts the United Nations may undertake with the aim of resolving the issue of the international status of the Republic of China on Taiwan in a manner which would be acceptable to both the Government of the Peoples Republic of China and the authorities in Taiwan. As the United Nations celebrates 50 years of existence, let us take full stock of the work of the Organization since its birth. Let us retrace our steps and weigh our achievements and failures so that we may approach the twenty-first century with renewed vigour and commitment. Let us not lose sight of the ideals which the Organization stands for as we continue to uphold the necessary flexibility for its adaptation to current trends. that lest we forget, Lastly, to those who love and cherish democracy let the word go out, the name “Nyasaland” at one time represented the biblical David and Goliath in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which, if it had been given birth, would have made the script for that region a different story. When the borders that defined our nationhood opened again and we became part of Mother Africa and the rest of the world, our State President, Bakili Muluzi, burst out of a suffocated Malawi, which had become a prison, and invited the world to come and rejoice with us. The silent Malawians who had crept out of Malawi, cautious not to speak to General Assembly Fiftieth session others about the pain of imprisonment and death in their prison country, now saw a new leadership, not only in President Muluzi, but the country themselves. If these 15 months of the new Malawi have not meant much to the World Bank, the fatigued donors and the sceptical theoreticians, let them remember the following great words of Pliny: in the people of “There is always something new out of Africa. Its presence on this continent, like the great seas that surround it, are legendary. Ignore Africa to your peril.” (Pliny the Elder, Natural History, VII, 77) In the same breath, we plead to you here again and again: listen to what was said at the United Nations social summit meeting, at the United Nations womens summit meeting and during the International Year of the Child. There is no hope for mankind in the twenty-first century and after without a United Nations based on those three great occasions. Malawi pleads to those great nations that have grown up with the ideals and ideas of human giants of the world not to jump off the ship that carries us all. No one can say, “Stop the world, I want to get off.” On behalf of the people of Malawi, I thank Members of the General Assembly for their attention. Mr. Oyono (Cameroon) (interpretation from French): The delegation of Cameroon congratulates Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fiftieth session. We wish him well as he guides the work of this historic session, which fiftieth coincides with the anniversary of I do Mr. Freitas do Amarals distinction as an educator and a statesman, I welcome his election. the Organization. Knowing as commemoration of the Moreover, the President represents a friendly country, Portugal, whose involvement in Africa is of long standing and which shares with Cameroon a part of our history: When he alit on the coast of the Gulf of Guinea in 1472, the Portuguese Fernando Po was much impressed with the abundance of shrimp in the waters off what is now the city of Douala and named the place “Rio dos Camaroes” — Shrimp River — from which Cameroon takes its name. We also convey our appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cote dIvoire, for the way in which he carried out his responsibilities as President of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. 21st plenary meeting 5 October 1995 Finally, we pledge to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our constant support in his tireless efforts to enable the Organization to attain its noble purposes. It is of enormous significance that the present session of the General Assembly should coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the Organization. The United Nations, which sums up and expresses the deep-felt aspiration of the peoples and nations of the world to peace, an indispensable conclave of nations. The Organizations universality makes it the ideal forum for governing the world order. freedom and progress, has become The celebration of the fiftieth anniversary should therefore be a source of satisfaction to the entire international community. It provides an opportunity to gauge how far we have come since the beginning and to consider our views on the future of the Organization. When they created the United Nations after the Second World War, the founders affirmed their determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. Fortunately, for more than half a century the North — once the epicentre of most of historys major conflicts — has been a place of peace and cooperation; and, despite the build-up of weapons of mass destruction, the rivalry between the two great ideological and military alliances did not drag international society into a third world war, which would have sealed the fate of mankind. Aware of the danger to the world posed by the arms race, the United Nations encouraged the conclusion of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its indefinite extension; it has promoted the creation of denuclearized zones, inter alia in Africa, and the conclusion of the Convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons; and it has given decisive impetus to multilateral negotiations on disarmament. We are glad that, in its ongoing quest for peace, the Organization has been able when necessary to adapt the Charter to the realities, including by devising the notion of peace-keeping operations, which have defused many conflicts and created favourable conditions for dialogue and negotiation. By awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to United Nations peace-keeping forces on 29 September 1988, the Nobel prize committee paid tribute to the devotion and courage of the more than half a million men and women 19 General Assembly Fiftieth session who since 1948 have served the cause of peace all over the world. Even if in recent years peace-keeping operations have had mixed results and have been accused of consuming the lions share of United Nations resources to the detriment of development, it must be recognized that while the path has not always been smooth, these operations have on the whole yielded positive results. The “Agenda for Peace”, then, remains relevant, and must continue to be the foundation of United Nations peace-keeping operations. strengthen its the timeframe for Cameroon supports the recommendations of the Working Group to strengthen these operations by defining in advance precise objectives, the intervention, and the resources needed for implementation. Similarly, and as we have always said, the United Nations must and subregional organizations by making available the means necessary to enable them to discharge their peace-keeping mandate. That is why we welcome cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity in the area of prevention, management and settlement of conflicts on a continent riddled with crises and conflicts of many forms and many dimensions. cooperation with regional This applies also on the subregional level: to the role in the area of peace-keeping of the Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa, which deserves support, as the Committee, which was created with the assistance of the Secretary-General, brings together 11 Central African countries which have decided to set up within their national armed forces units specializing in peace-keeping operations to be carried out under the auspices of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. Cameroon trusts that the United Nations will show greater interest in this available force of more than 10,000 soldiers, which could serve as reserve forces for peace missions. Another area where United Nations action has been particularly significant is decolonization. Thanks to that action and to their own peoples emancipation struggles, many colonial Territories have gained independence and sovereignty; today they make up more than half of the membership of the Organization. More than any other continent, Africa is proud to have unswervingly promoted the process of its own total liberation, which was recently completed with the end of apartheid in South Africa. Here we recall with gratitude that it was under United Nations auspices that Cameroon attained sovereignty after 20 21st plenary meeting 5 October 1995 having been first a German colony, then a Territory under League of Nations Mandate, then a United Nations Trust Territory. It is our hope that the few Territories remaining under foreign administration will freely exercise their inalienable right to self-determination, so that the United Nations objective of eradication of colonialism by the year 2000 may be realized. complete the Also to the credit of the Organization are the promotion of human rights, the ongoing development and codification of international law, and achievements in all the areas covered by the specialized agencies. the most vulnerable and those The promotion and protection of human rights in and general disadvantaged in particular are at the centre of our concerns and those of the United Nations. The creation of the Centre for Human Rights, the convening at Vienna of the World Conference on Human Rights and the appointment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights all enable the United Nations to follow progress in the area of human rights throughout the world and to assert certain principles by which States must abide. Cameroon welcomes to recognition of and respect for all human rights, including the right to development. and attaches great importance of this, As regards humanitarian assistance, our Organization has been active on all fronts where it has been needed, providing aid to victims of catastrophes and natural disasters and war. At this stage, I would like to mention and welcome action taken in the field by the United Nations through the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and other organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO). On another matter, we would like to welcome progress by the United Nations in the fight against the scourge of drugs. The United Nations International Drug Control Programme is a result of concerted efforts by the United Nations and Member States in the fight against the production, sale, demand for and traffic in, and the unlawful psychotropic substances. Cameroon pledges and invites other States to pledge unreservedly their support for the United Nations distribution drugs and of, General Assembly Fiftieth session Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in order to stop the scourge of drugs. in the community, We would like to emphasize the considerable efforts exerted by the United Nations to focus the attention of the context of world international conferences, on other questions of interest that require collective action, which should be taken by the entire community of nations. These concerns have been manifested through the World Summit for Children, the Rio Conference on Environment and Development, the World Conference on Human Rights at Vienna, the International Conference on Population and Development at Cairo, the World Summit for Social Development at Copenhagen, the Cairo Conference on the Prevention of Crime, and Fourth World Conference on Women at Beijing. On the question of women, it is highly desirable that all States immediately follow up on the decisions and recommendations of the Beijing Conference. But these successes of our Organization that I have just mentioned may not have met the expectations of all peoples. First, in the area of international peace and security, the Organization has not been able to prevent the spread of sources of tension and conflicts throughout the world. Until recently, it has been practically powerless in the face of the tragedies of the former Yugoslavia, Somalia and Rwanda. In the arena, economic and economic and social development the Organization, notwithstanding the declaration of four United Nations decades, has not succeeded in adopting declarations, programmes of actions and other strategies to bring about progress in developing countries. The proof is that conditions in these countries are still unfavourable, and, in order to experience growth once again, they must engage in policies of structural adjustment, the social burden of which has been a source of major concern to their Governments. This is true also of the high price they must pay to join the mainstream of world trade in order to avoid further marginalization. Development is primarily the responsibility of States and the peoples concerned. Cameroon nevertheless believes that the United Nations should, because of its universality and in the best interest of the international community as a whole, help to ensure global solidarity and interdependence with a view to promoting development for all. This means that we must stop inveighing against Africa in uniformly 21st plenary meeting 5 October 1995 pessimistic, not to say doomsday, tones. This style is all too familiar and suggests that our continent is, in the history of the world, nothing but a passive onlooker. But who, in all seriousness, can place at the sidelines of world events an entire continent, with 700 million inhabitants today — 800 million in the year 2,000 — and with immense natural, human, cultural and spiritual wealth? In this connection, the Holy Father, speaking of Africa, on the occasion of his recent second visit to Cameroon, appealed in his post-synod apostolic exhortation for avoidance of any blanket condemnations of an entire population, an entire nation or, still worse, an entire continent. In spite of the serious difficulties that its future. The sweeping changes which it it must overcome, Africa is determined to shoulder responsibility for is experiencing today are nothing but the forerunners of a nascent order whose purpose will be to integrate our continent into the world of the third millennium. This process of transformation is already yielding fruit in most of our countries. As regards Cameroon, I would like in this connection, to emphasize our irreversible pursuit of the process of democratization begun by Presidency Paul Biya at the very moment he assumed power in 1982. Between now and the end of this year, there will be significant progress in this process with the adoption of a new Constitution allowing for greater democratic participation by the citizens of Cameroon in the management of their own affairs, and a better balance among the various powers of Government. I would like to mention the impact our measures of recovery and economic liberalization have had on various sectors of activity. Cameroon is enjoying self-sufficiency in food, and is beginning to enjoy growth again. Inflation has been halted and macroeconomic balance in major areas has been re-established. In a word, there are signs of life in economic activity. Strengthened by the credibility confirmed — had that really been needed — by the recent the agreement with the International Monetary Fund, my country is widening its action for the acceleration of its economic recovery. signing of Our Organization is confronted with a sudden and unexpected acceleration of history. Never has there been such an acute sense of upheaval. The same questions keep cropping up everywhere: Will the world in the future be meaningless? What will the world order be like in the future? Will the Organization have a hand in this new 21 General Assembly Fiftieth session 21st plenary meeting 5 October 1995 order? And, finally, will it have the ability to be the melting pot for this? But, when all is said and done, the end of the cold war has brought fair weather. However, it is clear that, 50 years after its creation, the Organization needs to turn over a new leaf. That being so, might it not be highly desirable for it to re-think its role, its tasks, its functions, with a view not just to adapting to this new context, but to responding better to the ever- increasing and ever-more-insistent aspirations of the peoples to peace and well-being? In any case, this is the desire of Cameroon. This anniversary must also be taken as an opportunity for renewal, for highlighting and praising the wealth of universality in the diversity in our Organization. This is an opportunity to renew our pledge and commitment to the purposes and ideals of the Charter. This pledge and this commitment must be translated into a strengthening of our determination and our ability to act collectively so that, as was the wish of the founding fathers, we can save future generations from anguish, fear, poverty, suffering and all sorts of uncertainty, and so that we may finally move forward along the path of transforming the tools of war into the tools of peace. future for These are the responsibilities we would like the Organization to shoulder in order to ensure a better world and a better the next millennium. In this connection, the manner in which the United Nations discharges its responsibilities, or rather the success of United Nations missions, will depend on the real collective political will of its Member States. the generation of For its part, Cameroon feels that the current thinking on the restructuring of the Security Council augurs well for the revitalization of the Organization. The same is true of the successful outcome of peace-keeping efforts made possible by United Nations action and the concerted action of the international community in Cambodia, Central America, Angola, Haiti, Mozambique and Eritrea. On the same lines, the new diplomatic deals that are evolving in the former Yugoslavia and the Middle East are undeniably very encouraging developments. In the final analysis, then, there is no reason not to believe that in the near future the peoples of regions where conflicts are continuing will, like so many others, have their rendezvous with peace. In all of these cases, Cameroon has the feeling that a lasting solution will have to come through a meeting of the political wills of the chief protagonists and the collective will of the international community. In spite of the difficulties that have impeded action in the areas both of peace-keeping and of economic and social development, the balance sheet of the Organization — though certainly uneven — is not as negative as some would have us believe. The celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations gives the international community an ideal opportunity to consider the ways and means available to our Organization to carry out the collective work of ensuring peace, security and prosperity for all. 22 Cameroon, for its part, is prepared to contribute.
