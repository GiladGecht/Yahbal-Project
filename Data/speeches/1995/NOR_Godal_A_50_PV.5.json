{"speech":{"0":" Mr. Godal I wish first of all to congratulate the President of the General Assembly upon his election to his high office in the year of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. May I, at the same time, extend my sincere thanks to the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, for his excellent work. Fifty years ago, my countryman Trygve Lie became Secretary-General of an Organization with a very modest structure but with a “sacred mandate”, as he said in his acceptance speech, “to build a firm foundation for the peace of the world”. (Official Records of the General Assembly, First Session, Plenary Meetings, 22nd meeting, p. 326) Since then, even greater demands have been made on the United Nations in terms of leadership, ideas, manpower and finances. On the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary, we must empower the United Nations to work with renewed vigour and effectiveness in promoting peace, human rights, sustainable development, equality, justice and understanding among peoples. Rather than being poised to take on new challenges, however, the United Nations finds itself in a financial crisis of major proportions. The Secretary-General has recently pointed out that the Organization is, in a technical sense, insolvent — yes, bankrupt. Only prompt payment by a small number of Member States has enabled it to continue to operate. The situation is more serious than ever before because of the unprecedented amounts involved and the fact that one major contributors payment is being withheld and is expected to be unilaterally reduced in the years ahead. This situation financial desperate the inadequate priority given to the United Nations by many of its Members, which is in clear violation of their obligations. It may sound harsh, but, coming from a country which consistently pays $100 per capita to the United Nations reflects 10 5th plenary meeting 25 September 1995 system, I have difficulties in explaining to my own electorate that other rich countries are not even willing to provide one tenth of that level. At the same time, I realize that the United Nations assessment system should be reformed without delay. Moreover, experience has shown that the United Nations itself needs to be reformed, restructured and modernized. Norway wholeheartedly supports the reform process launched to strengthen the United Nations system and make it more representative and effective. This should include expansion of the membership of the Security Council and increased transparency of its methods of work. To meet the twin challenges of peace and sustainable development, the United Nations and its Member States should proceed along five parallel paths. First, we must help increase local and regional capacity to handle conflict situations. For instance, African countries have signalled via the Organization of African Unity (OAU) that they are prepared to take on a larger share of the responsibility for solving their own problems. In response, Norway will cooperate with partners in Southern Africa in building up standby reserves of qualified personnel for peace operations under United Nations or OAU auspices. Secondly, more nations must be willing to contribute to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. Traditional troop contributors do not have the capacity to provide all the personnel that will be needed in future peace-keeping missions aimed at solving disputes, protecting local populations and providing humanitarian assistance. Both the United Nations and the traditional troop-contributing countries must assist potential troop contributors with competence-building measures, the Nordic countries are now assisting the Baltic States. just as Thirdly, the rapid-reaction and standby capability of the United Nations must be improved. Norway is prepared to join in efforts to develop new, much-needed instruments to deal quickly and effectively with crisis situations. The rapid-reaction capability must also include humanitarian assistance. The United Nations should continue in coordinating humanitarian relief efforts. to play a central role Norway has given high priority to measures that enable us to respond expeditiously to requests for assistance. We have established an effective preparedness General Assembly Fiftieth session system for emergency assistance that covers both personnel and materiel. Emergency equipment can be airborne within 24 hours. Experienced personnel can be in the field within 72 hours. In Rwanda, a fully equipped field hospital, accompanied by the necessary personnel, was recently delivered at short notice to the United Nations, in accordance with these procedures. With a view to improving the United Nations to support requirements, Norway has offered to provide facilities for a United Nations medical depot where medical equipment and supplies for peace-keeping and humanitarian operations can be stored and maintained. response Fourthly, we must put even greater emphasis on conflict-prevention measures. The international community must be present in unstable areas and must provide economic incentives, mediation expertise and human rights monitors. Conflict prevention is the most effective way of using limited resources. Norway will continue to shoulder its share of the responsibility — for instance, in Guatemala, where we are actively involved in the peace process, together with the other members of the Group of Friends. Norway has established a special human-resource bank for human rights and democracy, which is able, at short notice, to offer experts to assist countries and peoples in their efforts to build democratic societies. The international community must be prepared to act decisively when atrocities are committed. Serious crimes should be prosecuted by an international criminal tribunal. The establishment of the ad hoc Tribunals in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda has provided momentum for the efforts to establish a permanent court. The tribunals role should be limited to cases where national jurisdiction is unavailable or ineffective. Fifthly, on the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary, we call on the United Nations to take a decisive lead in promoting sustainable development and eradicating poverty. Efforts to improve global security must address the issues of economic growth, development and poverty, while ensuring that the use of natural resources is kept within the carrying capacity of the Earth. The United Nations must become a driving force for sustainable development. the truly global problems The United Nations is the only forum with a mandate affecting the to tackle environment and the sustainable management of natural resources. Let me offer some brief examples. The Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks provided an invaluable contribution to the management of fishery resources. We are also pleased that, just a few days ago, the 5th plenary meeting 25 September 1995 United Nations Panel on Forests was able to take the first steps to protect, preserve and manage the worlds forests in a sustainable manner. I would like to stress the need for a concerted effort within the United Nations system to ensure that the results from the major conferences in Cairo, Copenhagen and Beijing social development and women actually become translated into law and realities, the international level. locally, nationally and at respectively, population, on, insult With a growing world population, we have witnessed the spread of the gravest to human dignity — poverty. Our inability to eradicate poverty haunts our common conscience. As long as the gap between rich and poor, whether between States or within States, continues to widen, we cannot claim to be on the right track. If we are to alleviate poverty, both donors and recipients must make more resources available for social welfare activities. At least 20 per cent of development assistance budgets and national budgets of recipient countries should be allocated to the social sector. The conflict in the former Yugoslavia is far from being solved, even though the prospects for a negotiated solution now appear much better than they did until recently. Norway welcomes the agreement on basic principles which resulted from the Geneva meeting on 8 September. The United States of America deserves praise for its persistent efforts in this regard. It is vitally that important international community, in particular the contact group countries, continue their common approach to the solution of the crisis. the United Nations and the European Union mediators a valuable contribution. the members of In this context, can make the The success of the mediation efforts depends entirely on the readiness of the parties to compromise. We strongly urge all the parties to show flexibility and restraint, and to refrain from attempting to obtain further advantages on the battlefield. Special attention must be given to displaced persons, who, whenever possible, must be allowed to repossess their homes. The time has come to start reflecting on the reconstruction of that war-devastated region. This will require a sustained international effort. The United Nations system together with the European Union and others must play a leadership role in coordinating economic programs various fields, in such as 11 General Assembly Fiftieth session reconstruction, humanitarian aid and assistance to refugees, democracy-building and human rights. Local leaders have a heavy responsibility to prevent a new arms race, human rights abuses and the renewal of tensions in the area. Norway will continue to support the process of building peace and prosperity in the former Yugoslavia. I call on the General Assembly to lend its full and undivided support to the peace process in the Middle East. The new interim agreement is a significant and necessary follow-up to the Oslo agreement. Today we salute once more the Israeli and the Palestinian leaders for their courage and determination. As Chairman of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee to coordinate donor activities, I strongly urge the donors to continue to support — for some donors, to increase their support of — the Middle East peace process by providing economic assistance to the Palestinian people. Our common interest in peace in the Middle East is the best argument for heavy economic support to the Palestinian areas. Nuclear testing is a threat to our search for common security and to the environment, and should be banned. We deeply deplore the Chinese and French tests, which we fear may complicate the ongoing negotiations in Geneva on a comprehensive test ban treaty. We would once again urge all nuclear-weapon States to refrain from further nuclear testing during the negotiations and until the treaty enters into force. Land-mines are among the most insidious weapons in common use. They cause indiscriminate and widespread suffering and continue to spread terror for years or even decades after hostilities have ended. We call for a total ban on the production, and use of anti-personnel land-mines. In the absence of such a ban, we urge all countries to adhere to the United Nations 1980 inhumane-weapons Convention. No strengthening of the land-mine Protocol will be effective unless adherence to it becomes universal. stockpiling, trade Finally, let us seize the opportunity offered by the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations to renew our support for the United Nations and its aims. Each and every one of us must help to ensure that the United Nations becomes what we need and what future generations have the right to expect: an effective tool to harness our strength and unite us in maintaining peace, promoting social progress and protecting human dignity. 5th plenary meeting 25 September 1995 Mr. De Moura (Angola) (spoke in Portuguese; English text furnished by the delegation): Permit me at the outset, Sir, on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Angola and of my entire delegation that is accompanying me, to express my satisfaction at your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. We are convinced that your excellent personal qualities and the diplomatic skill you have accumulated will guarantee the success of the conduct of the work of this significant session. Your election is also well-deserved recognition of the important contribution which your country has made to the promotion of peace and international security. I assure you, at this stage, of the cooperation of my delegation. We commit ourselves to doing everything to support this arduous but honourable task with humility and a sense of responsibility. I cannot let this opportunity pass without expressing my appreciation to the outgoing President, Mr. Amara Essy, for the dedication and interest with which he carried out the activities of the Assembly during his mandate. Similarly, I address my remarks to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has tenaciously done everything, the problems afflicting humanity, pledging to provide our Organization with the dynamism needed to face future challenges. to find the very best solutions for The fiftieth session of the General Assembly, which coincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, provides us with an opportunity to engage in profound reflection on the extent to which we have moved forward towards the realization of its main goals, inter alia, preservation of international peace and security, promotion and protection of human rights, and economic and social development, with a view to looking more optimistically and more boldly at the challenges which lie ahead on the eve of the twenty-first century. the cold war In fact, although the changes that took place in the wake of led to a certain easing in international relations and promoted, as never before, democratic values, the international situation nevertheless has continued to deteriorate in recent times in the political, economic, social and financial spheres. Conflicts of all sorts proliferate, affecting principally the countries of the so-called third world and creating a climate of uncertainty as to the future of humankind. "}}
