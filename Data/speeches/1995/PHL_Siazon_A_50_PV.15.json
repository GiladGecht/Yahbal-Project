{"speech":{"0":" It is with special fervour that I congratulate Mr. Freitas do Amaral, on behalf of the Philippine delegation, on his election as President of the United Nations General Assembly in this landmark session. Let me also express the gratitude of my delegation to Mr. Amara Essy, the Foreign Minister of Cote dIvoire, for the excellent leadership which he provided us at our forty-ninth session. Our tribute goes also to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali and to the men and women of the Secretariat, who, in the course of the past year, carried out their indispensable tasks under circumstances of great difficulty for them and for the Organization. In three weeks, most of the worlds Heads of State or Government will gather in this Hall to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the United Nations. They will no doubt recall how the founding fathers of our Organization convened in San Francisco, animated by their resolve to transform the world. It was a world devastated by a global war. Like most wars, it was ignited by the propensity and ability of nations to use force to acquire territory and resources, to avenge past wrongs, or to Sadly, however, these considerable achievements were offset, in a fundamental way, by the continued and the United Nations proclaimed repeated defiance of purposes by so many men and nations, in so many instances. Almost from the beginning of the existence of the United Nations, and despite the United Nations, man persisted in his ability, propensity and willingness to use force in order to achieve his national or ideological ends. If peace was kept on a global scale, it was only because the mutual threat of nuclear annihilation deterred the launching of full-scale war. In the international economy, countries sought to beggar their neighbours through the unabashed use of a full range of protectionist and mercantilist tools. Today, however, in the fiftieth year of the United Nations, we can say with a measure of plausibility, that the world has indeed been transformed; and we can hope, with a degree of realism, that the idealistic vision of the United Nations can be substantially attained. One of the central aims of the United Nations — the liberation of colonized nations — has been largely achieved. The worlds most mightily armed Powers have pulled back from the brink of nuclear annihilation. No longer do nuclear-armed ideological camps face each other in deadly confrontation, and mankinds survival no 16 General Assembly Fiftieth session longer hangs in the perilous balance of mutual nuclear threat. The Philippines is gratified by the decision earlier this year to extend indefinitely the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and calls for the conclusion early next year of a comprehensive test-ban treaty that would put an absolute end to all nuclear testing. The international community has reached agreement on the elimination of other devices of mass destruction and of inhumane weapons. In particular, the Philippines urges the ratification and the strengthening of the 1980 Convention on the Prohibition of Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects. We call for the early entry into force of the Convention on the Development, Production and the Prohibition of Stockpiling on Their Destruction, and the full implementation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) Weapons and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction. of Chemical Weapons and In place of the use and threat of force, more and more nations have resorted to dialogue and reconciliation in dealing with disputes among themselves or with their neighbours, even in the case of conflicts which the “realistic” had considered to be insoluble. Almost throughout its entire existence, the United Nations has been seized with the conflicts in the Middle East. But only four days ago, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, with the approbation of other States in the area, took another significant step on the difficult road to peace. In South Africa, where a minority regime long oppressed the majority with systematic cruelty, a multiracial Government now administers the country with success that has surpassed even the worlds most In Latin America, old territorial disputes are now the subject of dialogue and consultation. fervent expectations. in that In our own region, the political settlement of the conflict in Cambodia and the emergence of an elected government long-suffering country stand as crowning achievements of the United Nations, as well as of the countries of the region — a triumph of negotiation over the force of arms. We welcome the accord that was so painstakingly crafted a year ago to avert the development of nuclear arms in the Korean peninsula. We urge the resumption of serious talks between North and South Korea as a further contribution to peace and reconciliation in our region. The Government of Myanmar has agreed on a cease-fire and has undertaken negotiations with all but one of the minority nationalities in Myanmar, a remarkable 15th plenary meeting 2 October 1995 development in a country riven by inter-ethnic conflict for so long. Matching the spread of the spirit of dialogue and reconciliation, faith in the efficacy of market forces and economic liberalization as a condition and stimulant of development has been sweeping the world. Policies arising from this faith have unleashed the productive energies of many of the worlds people, a development largely responsible for the remarkable economic growth of countries in many parts of the world. Liberalization of international economic transactions and the resulting interdependence of the global economy have raised the stake of nations in one anothers prosperity and have thus considerably brightened the prospects of enduring stability and peace. Thus, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council, of which the Philippines is an active founding participant, is devoted solely to economic collaboration. its is But one of salutary by-products the strengthening of peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region, for now APEC participants have a growing stake in one anothers economic progress and political stability. We find in my country, the Philippines, a microcosm of the global trend of political reconciliation, economic liberalization, and regionalism. The peace talks that we are undertaking with rebel groups in the spirit of national reconciliation have brought a new stability to the country, providing the atmosphere of tranquillity so necessary for the resurgence of the economy. The military rebels have availed themselves of a programme of amnesty. Many of them now pursue their ambitions for the country through the legal political system, with one of them recently elected as a Senator of the Republic. The Government has been negotiating in Europe with the self-exiled leaders of the Communist Party, which is now legal in the Philippines and whose members are free to contest Philippine elections. the Islamic Conference, under With the assistance of the Committee of Six of the Organization of the chairmanship of Indonesia, negotiations are taking place with the Moro National Liberation Front. These negotiations have resulted in a cease-fire and agreement on more than 80 per cent of the points at issue. Peace in the an extraordinary surge in the economic growth of that region. We have opened wide the doors to the Philippine economy, welcoming foreign investment, letting in the bracing wind of foreign competition. We have lowered southern Philippines has made possible 17 General Assembly Fiftieth session to trade in fulfilment of our barriers commitments or through unilateral measures. international One of the results of these structural reforms is a growth rate that is respectable even by the standards of our fast-growing region. There are bright prospects for the continuation of this growth rate because it proceeds from solid policy foundations and is taking place within a system of pluralistic democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law. We have strengthened our bonds with our neighbours, through the Association of South-East Asian Nations above all. We have dealt with border questions and territorial disputes, including the conflicting claims in the South China Sea, through peaceful dialogue and consultation. The general improvement in global security, the rising tide of global prosperity, and the intensification of regional cooperation should give rise to hope, but it should not induce complacency, as new threats have arisen to confront us and old ones have swollen in magnitude and virulence. The dissolution of power blocs has unleashed latent tribalism that had been under authoritarian constraint. One of the most savage manifestations of this has been taking place in Bosnia and Herzegovina. International terrorism has become a global menace. The illicit trade in drugs undermines the fabric of society. Trafficking in women and children is a crime that cries out for international cooperative countermeasures. The recent resumption of nuclear testing by two of the to nuclear-weapon States poses an immediate threat peoples health, and the non-proliferation regime. We repeat our condemnation of these tests and ask that they stop — now and forever. environment, the natural Even as the notion of economic liberalization has been almost universally embraced as a condition and catalyst for development, many countries have resorted to inventive measures of disguised protectionism. Numerous developing countries continue to labour, like Sisyphus, under the crushing burden of foreign debt. labour Shortages of in resource-rich or rapidly industrializing economies have induced the large-scale migration of workers across national boundaries. Their presence in foreign lands has placed them in positions of vulnerability that require international cooperation for the protection of their rights and dignity as human beings. 18 15th plenary meeting 2 October 1995 The Philippines calls upon all States to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families. The Philippines is at one with the Group of 77 in calling for a United Nations-sponsored global conference on international migration. My delegation intends to pursue with great vigour General Assembly resolutions on violence against women migrant workers and on trafficking in women and girls. These are some of the more outstanding challenges that confront the United Nations as it enters its second half-century and approaches the next millennium. The United Nations, however, respond to the challenges of today and the next century with the organization and procedures of 50 years ago. The nature of the new threats to international peace and security requires a review of United Nations peace-keeping operations in order to streamline them and make them more effective. cannot At this stage, I must stress that, whatever measures are agreed upon, they must be financed adequately, in proportion to the capacity and degree of responsibility of Member States and not by sacrificing any development programmes. The United Nations is in a desperate financial situation. We cannot demand that it fulfil tasks that we are unwilling to finance. We cannot simply use the United Nations and then withhold from it the resources needed for its effective functioning. Year after year, we call for better management of the United Nations. The Philippines supports this call, and strongly articulated its position in this Hall last year. At the same time, we must point out that the United Nations cannot be managed efficiently if it is constantly uncertain of the resources available to it. We therefore appeal to all Member States, particularly the larger contributors, to make up their arrears, to pay their dues, and to pay on time. We have of late heard the proposition that in trying to achieve economy and efficiency in the United Nations we should look to the economic and social area, to those bodies whose mandate is to advance the interests of the developing countries — abolishing agencies here, gutting programmes there. We support the streamlining of multilateral development institutions and programmes. But we cannot accept moves to abolish the development General Assembly Fiftieth session agencies in the name of the \"division of labour\" or “comparative advantage”. What the international community needs to do with respect to these agencies — and the Bretton Woods institutions and the regional development banks — is to augment their resources, not to reduce them. We deplore the position of some Powers that refuse to raise their contributions to the international and regional financial institutions, but in their desire to maintain a dominant role in those bodies prevent others from increasing their own share. We have all come to this session ready to address the question of reform of the structure of the Security Council. The Councils structure is no longer adequate to meet the new and enlarged demands upon its mandate and no longer reflects the size and composition of the United Nations. The Philippines fully supports the enlargement of the Councils membership in order to ensure the equitable representation of all regions and of the developing countries. Any reform, however, must go beyond the question of membership. The question of the veto must be reviewed, as must the Councils working methods and procedures, in order to ensure the greatest transparency possible and the participation of as broad a range of countries as possible. The vital nature of its decisions requires no less. In this fiftieth year, as we recall At the same time, the growing importance of the role of the United Nations requires that its membership, as well as its functions, reflect the realities of today. Accordingly, we need to consider the proposition that, in the high interests of universality, no significant group of people should be left without representation in the United Nations. the founding principles and fundamental goals of our Organization, as we review its mandate and as we assess its strengths and weaknesses, its achievements and shortcomings, we must never lose sight of the fact that all our labours in the United Nations have as their centre and object the human person — his or her security, dignity and well-being — above ideology, above religion, above even the State itself. With the shrinking of this planet Earth, a process helped in no small measure by the United Nations itself, hundreds of millions more people are crying out for their own empowerment and for the universal respect of their rights and dignity. In this fiftieth year of our Organization, we in the United Nations must heed their cry if we are to keep faith with its mandate and mission. 15th plenary meeting 2 October 1995 "}}
