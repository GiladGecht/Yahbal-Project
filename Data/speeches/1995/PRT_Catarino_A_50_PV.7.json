{"speech":{"0":" I would like to reiterate here that Portugal has no interest in the question of East Timor other than its desire to see a recognition of the fundamental right of the people of East Timor to self- determination. It is our moral and historical duty as the administering State to work towards the achievement of that objective. According to resolutions of the General Assembly and of the Security Council, the process of decolonization was interrupted by the illegal invasion and occupation of the Territory by Indonesia. I would like to restate here our trust in the Secretary-General and in his mission of good offices, and our hope that the ongoing talks will lead not only to an improvement of the human rights situation in East Timor but also to the creation of a better atmosphere for the talks and to the ultimate goal of self-determination for the Timorese people. Mr. Samodra (Indonesia): My delegation would simply like to reiterate that both parties to the dialogue under the auspices of the Secretary-General should abide by their concurrence on continued restraint in the interests of maintaining the favourable atmosphere very much needed if we are to make further progress. We believe that Portugals pattern of, on the one hand, claiming that it is committed to dialogue with Indonesia and, on the other hand, continuing to upset the atmosphere by waging a campaign against Indonesia is not helpful. Mr. Catarino (Portugal): I would just like to recall that the present talks were undertaken on the initiative of Portugal. We are committed to the success of these talks. I reiterate what I have just said. Again, I wanted to say that the Secretary-General has our trust, and that we hope we will achieve progress in these talks"}}
