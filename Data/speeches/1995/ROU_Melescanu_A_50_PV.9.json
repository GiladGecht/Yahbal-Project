{"speech":{"0":" Allow me first, on behalf of the Romanian delegation, to congratulate Ambassador Freitas do Amaral of Portugal most sincerely, and all the members of the Bureau of the General Assembly, on their elections. Romania is fully committed to the ideals and goals of the United Nations Charter and, as an active Member, deeply appreciates the activity of the United Nations at this time of an anniversary celebration when it is in the process of redefining itself in order to meet the present international requirements and to anticipate what will happen in the third millennium. Allow me to convey to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our deep appreciation for his sustained efforts to adapt the United Nations to the ever- increasing requirements of a totally changing world. I did that already in Bucharest when he visited us last autumn. At that time we had a very useful exchange of views on problems concerning cooperation between Romania and the United Nations and concerning the availability and openness of the Romanian Government to support, and actively participate in, the global efforts of the United Nations. Romania is at present celebrating, not only the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, but also the fortieth anniversary of its admission to this world Organization. Despite its sacrifices and its important contribution to shortening the Second World War and the victory of the United Nations coalition, Romania was admitted to the United Nations 10 years after the Charter came into force. None the less, my country has proved its responsible commitment and its active role in the most important debate on international matters and in promoting the purposes and principles of the United Nations. In the six years since December 1989 the legislative and institutional framework for a democratic society has been constantly under development in Romania. The broad consensus of all political forces in my country eloquently proves that we as a nation have opted to become a law- 9th plenary meeting 27 September 1995 fundamental economy and for abiding State with respect for political pluralism, for a market and freedoms. The new institutions that have been established are now in operation and at the same time have been consolidated, thus contributing to the democratization of our society and the acceleration of the process of transformation, strategy for socio-economic reform which my Government has. in keeping with the rights The complex reform programme has been unfolding successfully. In 1995 the reality in Romania differs from that at the end of 1992. The success of macroeconomic stabilization, and the improvement in the macroeconomy in general are an important argument for the integration of Romania into the European Union as it is an argument for other countries of central Europe. That does not mean that reform in Romania is going along smoothly and without obstacles. As is the case with other central European countries, its implementation involves large social costs which require permanent social security measures. In this sense, I should like to emphasize the support and encouragement that the United Nations has given to Romania and to other countries in transition, which show the capacity of the world Organization to support the reform process. In this context, my delegation wishes to welcome the Secretary-Generals report entitled “Support by the United Nations system of the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies”. We feel that a substantial debate on this subject could define a new dimension for United Nations activity. Romania, which next year is to organize the Third International Conference of New or Restored Democracies has decided to make that meeting an important event the promotion of democratic values throughout the world. for Romanias political objectives are determined not by circumstances but rather by its decisive commitment to democracy, market economy, respect for human rights and the need to ensure the countrys peace and prosperity. We believe that Romanias integration into European and Euro-Atlantic security structures — the principal goal of our foreign policy — will stimulate our own efforts at democratization and reform. At the Governments willingness a noteworthy contribution to the achievement of the goals of those institutions and to the creation of favourable conditions this demonstrates the same time, economic, to make political and 37 General Assembly Fiftieth session for stability and security in Europe as well as peace and security in the world. By openly and unequivocally stating its basic interest in becoming part of the Euro-Atlantic economic, political and security structures, Romania is in no way neglecting its the furthering of relations with its neighbours. Indeed, relations with our neighbours, on a new footing, is a primary concern. In this connection I would mention the recent initiative taken by our President, His Excellency Mr. Ion Iliescu, who invited Hungary to join in consecrating the historical reconciliation, the Franco-German model — a remarkable example of success in the European spirit. on Romania has solemnly stated its willingness to undertake all diplomatic steps to move beyond the stage of purely political statements and to make the notion of reconciliation a fait accompli. The direct and unconditional invitation to Hungary to forge, with us, the future of our nations in a European spirit goes beyond a mere political- diplomatic step, envisaging as it does the establishment of a social and political framework based on greater confidence and more intensive cooperation. To put it another way, for Romania reconciliation means a consciously assumed and systematically pursued process. At the same time, it should constitute for our two countries the surest way to achieve integration into the main institutions of the new Europe, thereby contributing to the consolidation of stability and security in the region and thus in the rest of the continent. Romanias initiative in launching an appeal to Hungary to enter together into the historical reconciliation that is so greatly desired is the natural result of a policy of good-neighbourliness and understanding that Romania has been constantly pursuing with all its neighbours. Dialogue and pragmatic cooperation in various areas of activity with States from all regions of the world is, moreover, another important direction of our foreign policy. The disappearance of the iron curtain gave birth to a vast and complex process of international detente by creating a genuine framework for dialogue and cooperation between States. The renunciation of confrontational policies and the lessening of the nuclear threat created the conditions for the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We are convinced that that success 38 9th plenary meeting 27 September 1995 will assist the negotiations aimed at the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction and lead to greater transparency, both in the area of armaments and in the area of security guarantees, as well as to a complete ban on all nuclear tests. In recent years the United Nations has repeatedly put forward new concepts regarding international peace and security and economic and social development. and mechanisms In that context, I am grateful for this opportunity to recall the constant support Romania has given the Middle East peace process by encouraging the continuation of dialogue and contacts among the parties concerned. In recognition of its contribution to the positive results of that peace process Romania was invited to participate in the multilateral negotiations on the Middle East. It is prepared to participate in working groups on regional economic cooperation, water resources, the environment and refugees. Totally convinced that reason will prevail and that the irreversible Middle East peace process must be supported, in the future also Romania will encourage and support understanding and cooperation among all the peoples of the region. We sincerely hope that through the common efforts of all the parties involved, the United Nations and the international community, new progress will be achieved so that a comprehensive solution to the problems of that region can be found. The Yugoslav crisis continues to create deep concern in Romania, given its close proximity to the conflict zone. Romania has appealed many times to the parties involved in the conflict to refrain from any action that might lead to the deterioration of the situation and to halt military actions and resume negotiations. Faithful to its position of principle, Romania hails yesterdays adoption, at the United States Mission to the United Nations here in New York, of a joint statement of supplementary principles for a constitutional settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Romania will actively support any proposal and any realistic action that will accelerate the pacification process in the territory of including its peaceful reconstruction. former Yugoslavia, The political and military crisis in former Yugoslavia shows that attempts to achieve ethnic separatism and to gain territorial autonomy on the basis of ethnic criteria or to establish ethnic enclaves are not viable solutions. To the contrary, they may become sources of conflict and create enormous suffering for the population. General Assembly Fiftieth session 9th plenary meeting 27 September 1995 I should like to reaffirm from this rostrum the Romanian Governments decision to continue to strictly respect the sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), despite the immense economic losses to our country. We do hope, nonetheless, that the competent international institutions will take a more careful look at the effects of the sanctions on third States and that they will rigorously and realistically assess the role sanctions can play in the peace process. We hope that States that are in a position to do so, international financial institutions, and United Nations programmes and specialized agencies will all respond to the General Assemblys in resolution A concerning economic assistance to States affected by the implementation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). At the same time, we would be interested in seeing the Security Council take decisions, in line with the progress achieved in the political settlement of the crisis, with a view to lifting the sanctions. the sanctions against competent bodies appeal The situation in the eastern area of the Republic of Moldova is still a source of some tension. We are convinced that the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops, whatever their form or denomination, from the territory of that independent and sovereign State remains the key to the solution of the conflict in the eastern regions of the Republic of Moldova. Indeed, we note with satisfaction that the international community shares that view. We welcome the agreement reached between the Republic of Moldova and the Russian Federation on the withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of the former country. We view this as a positive step that can contribute to increased stability in the area, and we express the hope that this agreement will become operational. The United Nations has quite rightly been given a principal role in designing a new world order, one capable of responding to the hopes and aspirations of peoples. To achieve that goal, we believe, the United Nations must its structures to the requirements of economic adapt development and must pay increased attention to harmonizing commercial practices, technical cooperation and monetary policies of Member States and international financial institutions. Recent United Nations activity has been marked by an important series of summit conferences which have dealt with topics of major to all mankind. These conferences have emphasized the urgency, the seriousness and the complexity of the topics they have dealt with and international have expanded the sphere of action of interest to the environment, consensus regarding programmes throughout the world related social development, human rights and the status of women. We feel that the United Nations and Member States must focus their efforts on the ways and means necessary to implement the decisions adopted by those conferences. population, In this sense, I should like to mention the Plan of Action adopted by the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development. The usefulness of this document was reconfirmed at a regional seminar on its implementation in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe which was organized recently in Romania in cooperation with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). At the same time, I should like to express my Governments readiness to organize a similar meeting in Bucharest next year to consider the progress achieved at the regional level in implementing the provisions of the Platform for Action adopted by the World Conference on Women, held in Beijing. It is clear that the major global problems taken up by the United Nations cannot be resolved without adequate financial support. The unparalleled increase in the number of major problems brought to the attention of the United Nations has not been accompanied by an increase in necessary resources. The United Nations is today faced with a severe financial crisis. One possible approach to this crisis should be to consider the more effective use of the elimination of duplication in activities, more effective document control, productive use of human resources, strict financial monitoring and a permanent process of cost-benefit analysis. resources, available internal With regard to the use of resources, peace-keeping operations deserve special mention. The unprecedented increase in these operations indicates, among other things, a more active involvement on the part of the United Nations in the management of crises and in preventive diplomacy. This new trend has necessitated an increase in resources. If we take into account that the great majority of present conflicts involving United Nations peace- keeping operations are internal, we have to admit that the international community has very limited means for exerting pressure. Continuing ineffective operations does not serve to achieve the goals of the United Nations satisfactorily, and consequently the Romanian delegation supports the trend towards a closer and more rigorous examination of all decisions related to launching new peace-keeping operations or continuing existing ones. 39 General Assembly Fiftieth session Romania has made known its interest in limiting and preventing conflicts in different areas of the globe, not only by promoting and encouraging the discovery of political solutions, but also by participating in United Nations peace- keeping operations in Iraq and Kuwait, in Rwanda and in Angola. Romania is determined to make a substantial contribution to such operations and initiatives. To this end, a special programme has been adopted to increase our capacity to react adequately to any request from the United Nations or other bodies while strictly respecting the principles governing the activities of the United Nations. in Somalia, If we look back over the long road the United Nations has travelled during its half century existence and, in particular, if we look at the efforts it has made to adapt itself to the dynamics of international life in the last five years, we are convinced of the value and the historic destiny of the United Nations. I should like to assure the Assembly that Romania, with its dedication to peace, its desire to cooperate at all levels — bilateral, regional, multilateral — its firm commitment to protect international peace and security, its commitment to democratic values and respect for human rights, is determined to support the common heritage of values of the United Nations. Our presence among the Members of the United Nations for 40 years is based on the prestige and the moral authority which the United Nations enjoys in the eyes of the Romanian people. For this reason, we shall, with all our energy and our available resources, remain committed to the noble duty of serving the ideas and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. "}}
