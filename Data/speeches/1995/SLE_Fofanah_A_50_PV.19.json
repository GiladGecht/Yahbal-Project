{"speech":{"0":" Permit me, first of all, to congratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. Indeed, as we commemorate 50 years of the existence of our Organization, his unanimous election to preside over this Assembly is a fitting tribute to his country and an eloquent testimony to his personal experience and skills as a seasoned diplomat. I therefore want to assure him of my delegations fullest cooperation as he directs and guides our deliberations on this historic occasion, and to wish him every success in that endeavour. In a letter contained in that document, the Secretary- General informs me that since the issuance of his communications dated 19 and 22 September and 2 October 1995, Niger has made the necessary payments to reduce its arrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the Charter. To his immediate predecessor, and our esteemed Brother, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy of Cote dIvoire, I convey my delegations gratitude and appreciation for the exemplary manner in which he conducted the affairs of the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. May I take it that the General Assembly duly takes note of this information? It was so decided. Agenda item 9 (continued) General debate "}}
