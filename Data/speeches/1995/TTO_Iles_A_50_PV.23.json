{"speech":{"0":" It is a great honour to extend to you, Sir, warmest congratulations, on behalf of the delegation of Trinidad and Tobago, on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly. The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and the urgent need to respond to a number of major questions facing the Organization make this a singularly important year. We are confident that with your vision and leadership you will celebration of the We are also particularly pleased to welcome the small island State of Palau as the one hundred and eighty- fifth Member of the United Nations. Most States represented in this Hall were not present at the historic signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco 50 years ago, but on gaining independence they applied for membership in this Organization as an essential part of their quest for a secure and stable international environment and improved standards of living. Trinidad and Tobago, a small democratic State, which gained its independence in 1962, was no exception. Since 1962, when we became a Member of the United Nations, there have been profound changes in international relations and consequent increases in the responsibilities of this Organization. The most dramatic of these changes was the end of the cold war, which engendered a certain optimism that there would be an anticipated peace dividend which would provide impetus to development. Unfortunately this was not to be. The end of the cold war triggered an almost unprecedented surge of ethnic and nationalist conflict, which proceeded to consume much of the international community. international cooperation resources attention for and of the Our Organization has had to adapt quickly to meet these challenges. There was a sudden and meteoric rise in the volume and, indeed, the complexity of United Nations peace-keeping activities. The Organization has had its share of successes and disappointments. However, despite the failure to meet growing expectations, the United Nations can be justly proud of many of its achievements in the field of peace-keeping, in the restoration of democracy, and in its response to emergency situations. The successes in Central America, Cambodia, Namibia, Mozambique and South Africa bear ample testimony to the effective role the United Nations can play in the advancement of peace, justice and security. In our region, the cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of American States in the 9 General Assembly Fiftieth session restoration of the democratically elected President of Haiti shows what can be accomplished once the necessary political will exists in support of such actions. In this regard, we welcome the recently held legislative and local elections in Haiti, which, in spite of difficulties, saw thousands of Haitians assemble peacefully and safely to cast their ballots. We are confident that these developments will to consolidate democracy, and will assist in the process of national reconciliation. The international community must continue to assist the Government and people of Haiti in the post- emergency period and in their long-term efforts to achieve economic and social reconstruction. serve to enhance Haitis efforts In the Middle East, Trinidad and Tobago welcomes the interim agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on the expansion of Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank, which was signed in Washington, D.C. on 28 September 1995. It represents another significant advance in the process towards lasting peace in the region. As for the former Yugoslavia, we are encouraged by the efforts on the part of all sides in the conflict to come to the negotiating table, and we express the hope that this development will significantly advance the process towards peace and stability in that war-torn region. On the African continent, the spirit of reconciliation which has prevailed in some areas of conflict gives us hope that some of the seemingly more intractable problems can also be resolved. The international community must fulfil its responsibilities in assisting the process. Earlier this year the States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons decided to extend the Treaty indefinitely. The Conference also adopted a number of principles and objectives, one of which called for the completion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty no later than the third quarter of 1996. It was also the understanding of the international community that there would be no further nuclear tests, pending the entry into force of that treaty. Trinidad and Tobago has joined other parties to the Tlatelolco and Rarotonga Treaties in rejecting current nuclear testing by some nuclear-weapon States, and appeals to those States to heed the mounting requests to cease nuclear testing. Related to our environmental concerns over nuclear testing is the equally critical issue of the marine transport of fuel, plutonium and high-level radioactive wastes. These shipments continue to take place irradiated nuclear 10 23rd plenary meeting 6 October 1995 and fragile resources, and who possess neither despite the potentially catastrophic effects on small island developing States, whose vulnerable economies are overwhelmingly dependent on their marine and coastal the resources nor the capability to deal with possible accidents of this nature. My delegation would therefore like to reiterate the priority concern which we attach to this issue, and to urge the shipment countries to respect the wishes of the small island developing States and other en route States, which have called for an end to these shipments through their archipelagic and territorial waters as well as their exclusive economic zones. reflection and re-examination of The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations will be a time for the activities of the Organization, not only as they relate to conflict field of development as a necessary precondition for peace and as the best guarantee of long-term stability. situations but, equally, in the At for reforms legislative the national to a sector provide resilient level, Trinidad and Tobago has undertaken a programme of economic reform and restructuring of the economy, which is almost complete. Our development focus has been on the pursuit of a sound macroeconomic policy based on a number of measures, which include a disciplined fiscal stance and the consistent implementation of an orderly and broad- based divestment programme, the enactment of structural an designed and the growth of environment and internationally competitive private and one conducive to greater foreign investment, the liberalization of the trade and exchange-rate regimes aimed at enhancing our competitiveness and a comprehensive programme of reform of the domestic financial system. Emphasis has also been placed on the reform of the public sector and the provision of basic infrastructure in order to ensure the efficient delivery of reliable, high- quality services, the progressive restructuring of our educational system so as to put in place a sustainable human-resource development programme which would respond to the new challenges and needs of our development, and the employment of social policies aimed at protecting the most vulnerable in our society. In order to succeed, however, these measures must be complemented by a supportive regional and international environment. For small States, an imperative, cooperation systems are seen as providing the essential building blocks on which to construct hemispheric and wider integration is increasingly, regional regional and, General Assembly Fiftieth session 23rd plenary meeting 6 October 1995 international cooperation. At the last Conference of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Heads of Government, held at Georgetown from 4 to 7 July, Trinidad and Tobago was pleased to welcome Suriname as the fourteenth member of the Caribbean Community. tackling the questions of protectionism, capital flows, reform of the international economic decision-making processes and management of the global economy must be the focus of our efforts. The successful inaugural summit meeting of the Association of Caribbean States, which was held at Port of Spain from 17 to 18 August 1995, has also opened a new chapter in the history of cooperation among countries of the wider Caribbean. The adoption of the Declaration of Principles and Plan of Action on Tourism, Trade and Transportation provides a practical blueprint to foster development and enhance economic integration among all countries of the Caribbean. In this context, Trinidad and Tobago reiterates the importance we attach to the full reintegration of Cuba in the Western Hemisphere. I have already alluded to the need to achieve greater balance in United Nations activities in the fields of peace- keeping and development. The need for such a balance assumes even greater urgency when one recognizes that to an increasing extent the nature, scope and complexity of development challenges today are beyond the limits and control of the nation State. assistance, development To the traditionally elusive development problems of persistent poverty, debilitating debt, declining levels of official unemployment, demographic pressures and the worsening income gap and terms of trade between developed and developing countries, one must add the new and additional challenges of environmental degradation and globalization. Some of these will continue to require a national approach, but the great majority of them are beyond the limits of national action and thus require a common commitment, a common approach, and a call to global neighbourhood action. The notion of shared responsibilities and the recognition of the need for mechanisms for collective action are the raison detre of the United Nations system. A coordinated and integrated United Nations system that is focused and adequately funded thus remains the best hope for effectively dealing with these myriad and complex development challenges. I can think of no better way to refocus and recommit the United Nations to the goals of development and global security for formulation and implementation of a comprehensive action-oriented agenda for development. An agenda which continues to address traditional development problems while simultaneously than through the all At the recent Fourth World Conference on Women at Beijing, the international community recognized the crucial role that women play in the development process and acknowledged that effective international cooperation for development will remain an elusive goal unless women can participate fully in the political, economic and social life of their respective societies. The Beijing Conference, along with the other global conferences held at Rio, Barbados, Cairo and Copenhagen, have served to buttress the case for an integrated approach to sustainable development, which must be informed by environmental, and human- social, demographic, gender resource considerations. The agenda for development must therefore seek to implement and fulfil, in an integrated manner, the these Conferences. commitments arising out of Within the agenda for development particular consideration must also be given to assisting developing countries, especially those with small and vulnerable economies in advancing their economic transformation and in facilitating their greater participation in the world economy. and as a as well favourable Trinidad and Tobago is committed to free trade and to placing its economy on a development path compatible with the demands of the new global order. However, as the challenges of globalization have demonstrated, national policies are not enough. To achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development we need a international supportive economic environment fair, open and non- discriminatory trading system, one which recognizes that small and vulnerable economies like our own are at a particular disadvantage because of our size and the lack of economies of scale. No effort must therefore be spared to ensure that we are provided with the necessary market access so critical to our trade-expansion and development objectives. Indeed, to do anything less within the agenda that for development would be a denial of the fact globalization greater responsibility on the major developed countries to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are favourable to growth and development in the rest of the world. now placed even has an Trinidad and Tobago is also of the view that the agenda for development offers an opportunity to develop 11 General Assembly Fiftieth session and the the global partnership for sustainable development and to promote the implementation of the agreements reached at the Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro in 1992. In this process, the special situation and needs of small island developing States environmental vulnerability must receive priority attention. Trinidad and Tobago therefore wishes the particular importance we attach to the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. recognition of to reiterate their In the Caribbean, recent devastating hurricanes have once again dramatically demonstrated the fragility of the ecosystems and the vulnerability of the economies of small islands. We are grateful to those Member States which have joined CARICOM countries in providing emergency assistance, and we appeal to the international community to continue its support for reconstruction efforts in the affected countries. The General Assembly will be called upon at this session to make several critical decisions relating to the future of the United Nations system. Trinidad and Tobago is of the view that the elements of the reform exercise currently before the Assembly constitute a good basis for a more effective United Nations. Indeed, Member States must use the momentum provided by this fiftieth-anniversary session to reach an agreement to expand the Security Council so as to enhance its legitimacy and effectiveness, to resolve the critical financial situation of the United Nations, to complete an action-oriented for Development with adequate and predictable resources for its implementation, and to strike a reasonable balance between resources for peace-keeping and for development. comprehensive Agenda and Reform, however, cannot be an end in itself. It is but a means to an end, and it will only be meaningful if we are united in the view that a strengthened and revitalized United Nations is an imperative, given the inescapable reality of todays global village; that the world of the future will need more, not international collaborative mechanisms to confront common threats; and that the only available instrument for the necessary global effort required to tackle these challenges. the United Nations effective remains fewer, The critical financial situation of the United Nations must be a source of concern to all Member States. The Secretary-General has described with increasing urgency and frustration the difficulties he is facing in carrying out 12 23rd plenary meeting 6 October 1995 the tasks entrusted to him because of a lack of the necessary resources. The failure, in particular, of the largest contributor to pay its legally assessed contributions has placed the Organization on the brink of insolvency. There must therefore be a greater commitment on the part of all Member States to meet their obligations, as well as a greater manifestation of will to resolve the overall financial situation of the United Nations. Unless we demonstrate this commitment, the paeans of praise with which we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary will have a very hollow ring. At this fiftieth anniversary of the Organization, let us recall the opening words of the United Nations Charter: “We the peoples of the United Nations ... have resolved to combine our efforts to accomplish these aims.” In a spirit of global partnership, we must renew our resolve, in accordance with the principles and purposes of the Charter, to ensure the realization of the objectives for which the Organization was established: peace, equality, justice and development for all. Trinidad and Tobago pledges to work with others to confront the challenges that face our Organization as we move towards the twenty-first century. "}}
