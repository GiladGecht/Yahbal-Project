{"speech":{"0":" It is a privilege to speak to the General Assembly today on behalf of the United States. A half-century ago the General Assembly first met here in New York, across the river in a converted skating rink at Flushing Meadows. In those modest surroundings our predecessors began to put in place an ambitious framework that they hoped would keep the peace as successfully as they had prosecuted the war. In the years since, the United Nations has helped bring peace, prosperity and hope to countless people around the world. Technological change has brought nations closer together than the founders of the United 9 General Assembly Fiftieth session Nations could possibly have foreseen. The United Nations itself has been challenged in unforeseen ways. It has had to manage complex humanitarian emergencies, from civil wars to mass movements of refugees to health epidemics. This evolution has placed great strains on the Organization and has revealed the necessity for far-reaching changes in how it is run. The Clinton Administration has vigorously made the case to our Congress and our people for continued American leadership at the United Nations. The United States made a commitment to the United Nations Charter 50 years ago, and we are determined to keep our commitment, including our financial obligations. We will always remember that for millions of people around the world, the United Nations is far from a faceless institution. It is, as Harry Truman once said, “a case of food, a box of school books; it is a doctor who vaccinates children; it is an expert who shows people how to raise more rice and more wheat.” To millions more around the world, it is the difference between peace and war. Economic and social development, as well as the protection of human rights, remain central to the United Nations mission. But the United Nations must change to meet new needs more effectively. When money is wasted in New York, Geneva or Vienna, when time is lost in bureaucratic inertia, the people who pay the price are those most vulnerable to famine, disease and violence. It is time to recognize that the United Nations must direct its limited resources to the worlds highest priorities, focusing on the tasks that it performs the best. The United Nations bureaucracy should be smaller, with a clear organizational structure and sharp lines of responsibility. Each programme must be held to a single simple standard: it must make a tangible contribution to the freedom, security and well-being of real people in the real world. In the last year, under the leadership of Secretary- General Boutros-Ghali, the groundwork for substantial change has been laid. The United Nations has an office with the functions of an inspector general and a mandate to crack down on waste and fraud. Under-Secretary-General Joe Connor has embarked on an aggressive campaign to improve the United Nations management culture, and we fully support his good work. The United Nations Secretariat has moved in the right direction by submitting a budget that 10 4th plenary meeting 25 September 1995 begins to restrain spending, and now this momentum for reform must accelerate. Let me propose a brief, concrete agenda for reform. responsible for organizations First, we must end United Nations programmes that have achieved their purpose, and we must consolidate programmes that overlap, especially in the economic and social agencies. The United Nations has more than a dozen development, emergency response and statistical reporting. We should consider establishing a single agency for each of these functions. We should downsize the United Nations regional economic commissions. We should ensure that the functions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development do not duplicate those of the new World Trade Organization (WTO), and we should adopt a moratorium on big United Nations conferences once the present series is completed, concentrating instead on meeting the commitments of those conferences that we have already held. Secondly, we need to streamline the United Nations Secretariat to make it more efficient, accountable and transparent. Each part of the United Nations system should be subject to the scrutiny of an inspector general. The United Nations must not tolerate ethical or financial abuses, and its managers should be appointed and promoted on the basis of merit. Thirdly, we should rigorously scrutinize proposals for new and extended peace-keeping missions, and we should improve the United Nations ability to respond rapidly when new missions are approved. We must agree on an equitable scale of peace-keeping assessments that reflects fully todays economic realities. And we should have a unified budget for peace-keeping operations. Finally, we must maintain the effectiveness of the Security Council. Germany and Japan should become permanent members, and we should ensure that all the worlds regions are fairly represented, without making the Council too large and unwieldy. We welcome the formation of the high-level group on reform, initiated under the leadership of the outgoing President of the General Assembly, Mr. Essy. Our goal must be that of a practical blueprint for United Nations reform and to ensure that it is adopted before the General Assembly finishes the work of its fiftieth session next fall. The way forward is clear; we have already seen and General Assembly Fiftieth session studied countless studies and reports. Now the time has come to act on the best proposals. As the Assembly knows, in my country there have been serious efforts to curtail our support for the United Nations. The President and I, and our entire Administration, believe it would be reckless to turn away from an Organization that helps mobilize the support of other nations for goals that are consistent with American and global to sustain support for the United Nations among the American people and among the people of other nations, is not enough that we defend the institution. The best argument against retreat is further reform. Tangible progress in that direction will help us win the battle for United Nations support that we are waging in the United States. interests. But it The United Nations must emerge from the reform process better able to meet its fundamental goals, including the preservation of peace and security. From Korea to the Persian Gulf to Haiti, the United Nations has provided a mandate to its Members as their responsibilities. The United Nations own Blue Helmets have helped nations create the basic conditions of peace in some of the most difficult situations imaginable around the world, even though they have not always achieved their intended purpose. they carried out Recently, a young Haitian father was asked what the peace-keeping forces had achieved in his country. He answered, “We walk freely. We sleep quietly. There are no men who come for us in the night.” In Haiti, as, for example, in Cambodia, Mozambique and El Salvador, the United Nations has shown that peace-keeping, despite its limitations, has been an enormously useful instrument. to implement phase two of One region where United Nations forces and the international community have played a critical role is the Middle East. Another historic milestone will be marked this Thursday, in Washington, when Israel and the Palestinians sign their agreement the Declaration of Principles. That agreement will bring to life a goal first set many years ago in the Camp David accords: to protect security and to give Palestinians throughout the West Bank control over their daily lives. The international community and the United Nations must continue to support this process, both diplomatically and economically. Israels 4th plenary meeting 25 September 1995 There is no question that the United Nations has never undertaken a mission more difficult than the one in the former Yugoslavia. The limitations of that mission are all too well known, but we all must recognize that it has provided relief for hundreds of thousands of people and has saved literally thousands of lives. Today, diplomacy backed by force has given the United States and the international community an opportunity to move forward on a track that is producing genuinely hopeful results. The United Nations the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are working effectively together to try to bring peace to the region. On 8 September in Geneva, accepted the fundamental goal that the Security Council has often expressed: the continuation of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a single State within its internationally recognized borders. I will be meeting with the Foreign Ministers of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia later today, and at that time I will urge them — implore them — to maintain the momentum towards peace and to establish constitutional structures for Bosnia. to the conflict the parties and The framers of the Charter of the United Nations created this institution to meet threats to peace and security posed by aggression and armed conflict. Those threats are still, unfortunately, very much with us. But today, the world also faces a new set of security challenges, including proliferation, terrorism, international crime and narcotics, as well as the far-reaching consequences of damage to the environment. These have assumed a new and dangerous scope in a more interdependent world. As President Clinton said in San Francisco in June, the “new forces of integration carry within them the seeds of disintegration and destruction”. terrorists, drug dealers and other While, as I said earlier, new technologies have brought us closer together, they also have made it easier for international criminals to acquire weapons of mass destruction, to set up cocaine cartels and to hide their ill-gotten gains. The collapse of communism has shattered dictatorships, to be sure, but it has also left the political and legal institutions of newly liberated nations even more vulnerable to those who seek to subvert them. Although these threats are sometimes sponsored by States, they increasingly follow no flag. Each of us must vigorously fight these enemies on our own, but we will never be truly secure until we effectively fight them together. That is the new security challenge for the global 11 General Assembly Fiftieth session community, and it must be the new security mission for the United Nations. There is no single area in which the United Nations can make a more significant contribution than in that of non-proliferation. Fifty years ago, the United States was the only country capable of making a nuclear bomb. Today many countries have the technology that would enable them to turn a fist-sized chunk of plutonium into a bomb as small as a suitcase. That is one reason why more than 170 nations agreed, at a conference held here last May and effectively chaired by Ambassador Dhanapala, to extend for all time the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. That is an achievement we must rejoice in but also build on. I should like to outline some steps in the field of non-proliferation. First, we should have a comprehensive test-ban treaty ready for signature by the time we meet here next September. As President Clinton announced last month, the United States is committed to a true zero-yield test ban. We urge other nations to join us in that commitment. Secondly, we should immediately start negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty. Those who have been most vocal in calling for nuclear disarmament should recognize that to ban future production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. is essential it Thirdly, we should push forward with the historic reductions of the nuclear arsenals of the United States and countries of the former Soviet Union. I call on the United States Senate, as well as on the Russian Duma, to approve the treaty on further reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms (START II) so that we can lock in deep cuts in our strategic nuclear arsenals. In addition, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin are working together to ensure the safety, transparency and irreversibility of nuclear-arms reductions. As part of this process, President Yeltsin will host a nuclear safety and security summit in Moscow next spring. This summit should have a very ambitious agenda, including a declaration of principles on nuclear safety. We look to this summit to address the worldwide problems of nuclear-waste management, including those of ocean dumping. The summit should also promote a plan of action to safeguard nuclear materials, a plan that should include new measures to prevent criminals and terrorists from acquiring nuclear materials for use in weapons. 12 4th plenary meeting 25 September 1995 Finally, we should push for the earliest possible entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention. President Clinton has urged the United States Senate to act promptly on its ratification, and to stop holding the START II Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention hostage to unrelated issues. The world has witnessed the effects of poison gas too many times in this century — on European battlefields during the First World War, in Ethiopia and Manchuria during the 1930s, and against Iranian soldiers and innocent Kurdish civilians in the 1980s. The Chemical Weapons Convention will make every nation safer, and we need it now. focusing attention The United Nations is also playing an invaluable role regional in proliferation problems. In Iraq, the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and its Chairman, Rolf Ekeus, continue to uncover horrific details about Saddam Husseins weapons of mass destruction. on pressing Under Saddam Hussein, Iraq developed a deadly biological-weapons capacity hidden from view. It was conducting research to turn some of the most toxic substances known to man into weapons of war. We know that Saddam succeeded in putting anthrax and botulism in bombs and missile warheads. In December 1990, he deployed these weapons, with every intention of using them against the international coalition and innocent civilians. He was dissuaded from doing so only by the steadfast determination of the United States and the international community. In the light of what Ambassador Ekeus has uncovered in Iraq, we can conclude only that for the last four and a half years, Saddam Hussein has lied about the full scope of Iraqs weapons programmes. There should be no easing of the sanctions regime against Iraq until its Government complies with all the Security Council and clearly demonstrates that it has changed its ways. the demands of also should The United Nations promote responsibility and restraint in the transfer of conventional weapons. At last years session of the General Assembly, President Clinton proposed, and the Assembly approved, the eventual elimination of anti-personnel mines. On my recent trip to Cambodia, I saw the terrible damage these hidden killers can do. This year, we will again call on other countries to join us in putting an end to the export of land-mines. General Assembly Fiftieth session Two years ago, President Clinton called on the international community to devise a true international system governing the transfer of conventional weapons and sensitive dual-use technologies. I am pleased that the Russian Federation has joined with the United States and 26 other countries to agree on a common principle to control the build-up of dangerous conventional arms. We hope to activate this global regime, which is called the New Forum, by the end of this year. The proliferation of weapons worldwide has added a disturbing dimension to another threat we all face: the threat of international terrorism. Indeed, this years sarin gas attack in Tokyo is a grim warning of what can happen when terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction. More nations are joining the fight against those individuals and groups that attack civilians for political ends. The United Nations has supported this effort in important ways. The Security Council recognized the importance of countering State-sponsored terrorism by imposing sanctions against Libya for the bombing of Pan Am 103 and UTA 772. Terrorists must be treated as criminals and there must be no place where they can hide from the consequences of their acts. States that sponsor terrorists should feel the full weight of sanctions that can be imposed by the international community. Let us not deceive ourselves: every dollar that goes into the Government coffers of a State-sponsor of terrorism such as Iran helps pay for a terrorists bullets or bombs. Irans role as the foremost State-sponsor of terrorism makes its secret quest for weapons of mass destruction even more alarming. We must stand together to prevent Iran from acquiring such threatening capabilities. The United States has taken a leading role in meeting the international terrorist threat. We have intensified our sanctions against Iran. Last January President Clinton issued an Executive Order prohibiting financial transactions with terrorist groups and individuals that threaten the Middle East peace process. We are urging our Congress to tighten our immigration and criminal laws to keep terrorists on the run or put them behind bars. The United States strongly supports the counter- terrorism measures the G-7 and Russia announced at the Halifax Summit, and we expect the G-8 Ministerial Meeting on Terrorism in Ottawa to produce a concrete-action plan to implement the Halifax Summit. these measures that were adopted at 4th plenary meeting 25 September 1995 Other kinds of international crime also threaten the safety of our citizens and the fabric of our societies. And globalization brings new and frightening dimensions to crime. The threat of crime is a particular menace to young democracies. It weakens confidence in institutions, preys on the most vulnerable in our societies and undermines free-market reform. Of course, every country must take its own measures to combat these criminal threats. The Administration that I represent is now completing a review of our approach to transnational crime, a review that will lead to a stronger, more coordinated attack on this problem. To help other States deal with criminal threats, the United States and Hungary have created the International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest to train police officers and law-enforcement officials from Central Europe and the States of the former Soviet Union. We are providing similar help bilaterally, and through the United Nations International Drug Control Programme, to those countries whose laws are challenged by international drug cartels. A particularly insidious form of crime and corruption is money-laundering. All nations should work together to implement the recommendations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to attack this insidious money-laundering. The nations of this hemisphere should also advance anti-money- the laundering initiative introduced at last Decembers Summit of the Americas. Together, we must work to squeeze the dirty money out of the global financial system. Through the United Nations conventions on drugs and crime the international community has set strong standards that we must now act to enforce. We call on Member States which have not already joined the 1988 drug Convention to do so promptly, and we call on those countries which have approved the Convention to move quickly to implement its important provisions. We are also increasingly aware that damage to the environment and unsustainable population growth threaten the security of our nations and the well-being of our peoples. Their harmful effects are evident in famines, infant mortality rates, refugee crises, and ozone depletion. In places like Rwanda and Somalia, for example, they contribute to civil wars and emergencies that can be resolved international intervention. We must carry out the commitments we extremely costly only by 13 General Assembly Fiftieth session made last year at the Cairo Conference, as well as the important commitments made at the Rio Conference three years ago. It has never been more evident Never have our problems around the world been more complex. these problems affect all nations, developed and developing alike. Only by working together can we effectively deal with the new threats we all face that I have outlined here today. that the United Nations, That is why in this fiftieth anniversary year we must shape the United Nations agenda as if we were creating the institution anew. Just as the founders of the United Nations devised a new framework to deter aggression and armed conflict, in particular the Security Council, must now assign the same priority to combating the threat posed by proliferation, by terrorism, by international crime, by narcotics and by environmental pollution. We should dedicate our efforts in the United Nations and elsewhere to turning our global consensus against these threats into concrete and effective action. We must renew and reform the United Nations not for its sake, but for our own. "}}
