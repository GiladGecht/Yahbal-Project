{"speech":{"0":" I have to confess to my usual excitement and pleasure at addressing the General Assembly, exceptionally crowded and patient even at this late hour. Let me begin by congratulating Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his election as President of the General Assembly at its fiftieth session. Mr. Freito do Amaral represents a country with a long history of global achievements. With his personal qualities and experience, he is a very natural choice to guide the work of this Assembly at such a critical moment. Let me also pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. for his dedicated and distinguished the General Amara Essy, stewardship during the last session of Assembly. I want also to record the gratitude of my to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Government Boutros-Ghali, the leadership that he continues to provide in the direction and work of the Organization. the measure and quality of for General Assembly Fiftieth session Barely three weeks ago Hurricane Luis wrought devastation on several island countries in the Caribbean, causing major setbacks to economic and sustainable development, as well as the loss of lives. As we ourselves recently experienced two similar disasters, our thoughts and sympathy are with the people of the Caribbean nations devastated by Hurricane Luis, and we pray for their speedy recovery. The President of the General Assembly, in his opening remarks, reminded us of the scope of the membership and the universal character of this Organization. Samoa is proud to note that a sister nation of the Pacific, the Republic of Palau, is the newest Member of the United Nations, and I am delighted to extend to Palau the warmest of welcomes. Two weeks ago the Republic of Palau was acclaimed to membership — becoming the sixteenth member — of the South Pacific Forum. That too was a moment of great pride for all of us. We come together at a special moment for this Organization and in the history of international cooperation. Undeniably, this is a session of exceptional importance. We need to take stock of where we, the United Nations, are and to set new goals and priorities for the future. Samoa believes that any stocktaking must be rooted in the Charter, which proclaims the purposes and principles of the Organization. Regrettably, the Charter pledges that we have made to succeeding generations remain largely unfulfilled. It is right, and it is natural, therefore that at this fiftieth session, we, the peoples of the United Nations, should seek to renew our commitment to those pledges. But first, it must be remembered that they are pledges that carry the attendant duty — a most sacred duty — to make them realities. It is a duty imposed upon us all and accepted upon membership in our Organization. Far too often, this is forgotten, or seemingly ignored. This session will also be the natural occasion on which to reaffirm our support for, and our faith in, the United Nations. I speak positively and unhesitatingly about reaffirmation because, quite frankly, what else is there to take the place of the United Nations? What we have is certainly not perfect. And given its almost universal make-up, the range of issues before it and the increasing demands being made of the United Nations, it would be surprising if this were the case. Indeed, in recent years, all of us in this Assembly have been engaged 13th plenary meeting 29 September 1995 in various activities aimed at making the United Nations more relevant, more efficient and more cost-effective and at preparing the Organization for the twenty-first century. We welcome in particular resolution , which was recently adopted, on strengthening of the United Nations system, and we look forward to taking part in the discussions in the Open-ended High-level Working Group established. If and when we have devised changes and improvements in the United Nations system, I dare say that in years to come it will be necessary to persist in monitoring and putting into place further needed reforms to ensure the sustaining vigour of the Organization. That being the case, there is clearly room for criticism and fault-finding, from among ourselves as well as from those who look on. We do not however think the shortcomings of the United Nations warrant uninformed cynicism and unfair blame, nor is sometimes levelled at it. irrelevance that the charge of But clearly, the standing and the very role of the United Nations is at risk if the Members continue to deny the Organization the funds and resources it needs. The Secretary-General has spoken of this matter time and again, and once more in his report on the work of the Organization (). The Organization is in a most critical financial state, but it is also clear that the situation can be substantially improved with the early payment of arrears and by the full and timely payment of assessed contributions. We can only urge the most immediate action on the part of those who know they must act. Samoa is a small and least-developed country. We are deeply committed to the United Nations, and we will continue to meet our financial and other responsibilities, notwithstanding the budgetary problems we face. We share the view that the strongest measures must be taken to achieve sound financial viability for this Organization. It would be essential for this purpose that there be a fair, more equitable and realistic scale of assessments, one which would take full account of the principle of capacity to pay. This must also take into account the predicament of some countries, including my own, which are assessed at the floor rate of the scale, at levels far beyond their capacity to pay. We believe there is a just case for abolishing or reducing the current floor rate. This is a matter of importance to many small States and we would hope that the High-level Working Group on the Financial Situation of the United Nations would continue to give it due consideration. 29 General Assembly Fiftieth session There is a second aspect, which touches on the emphasis now being given to United Nations peace-keeping activities. While Samoa recognizes the necessary and traditional role of the United Nations in promoting global peace and security, it seems to us that ultimately no amount of force and no measure of peace-keeping can sustain peace and security without attention to the root causes. Our own view is that human misery brought about by poverty and the denial of human and democratic rights are often the real and fundamental problems. Unless these are removed or minimized, there can never be the substratum that we need for lasting world peace and security. Put simply, Samoa believes firmly that social and economic development must remain a major preoccupation the United Nations, as pledged in the Charter. of global Development priorities for conferences and social advancement of should be effectively implemented. They should not be ignored while in terms of the Organizations attention and its focus, human and financial is diverted elsewhere, largely on peace-keeping activities. sustained economic the the developing countries in recent spelt out resources, For Samoa and other small island States disadvantaged by their size and geographical location, the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development on Small Island Developing States must remain a centrepiece of our attention. We welcome steps taken by the various organs of the United Nations system to implement the Plan of Action. We appreciate, in particular, what is being done by the Department for Policy Co-ordination and Sustainable Development and the Unit the implementation of the Programme of Action. These steps will complement efforts undertaken by our regional countries in the South Pacific region to further advance the commitments made in Rio, Barbados and elsewhere. set up to monitor Samoas commitment to the pursuit of global peace and security is unwavering. We will continue to do what we can. Conflicts which continue to rage in many regions of the world today cannot be ignored. They affect us all, for they impact directly or indirectly on the ability of the United Nations and the international community to respond to the development needs of others. We welcome the latest bringing a peaceful end to the conflict settlement acceptable to all parties must be reached. initiatives with a view to in Bosnia. A 30 13th plenary meeting 29 September 1995 Another milestone in the Middle East peace process was reached in Washington yesterday. With the rest of the world, we celebrate and commend the enduring efforts and commitments made by the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to lasting peace and security for all in that region. is of vital Our environment importance, and of singular concern to my Government. Our actions in the region and at the international level are dictated by a deep commitment to preserving it. Together with other countries in our region, we have initiated and concluded a series of treaty regimes, including those designed to protect the natural resources and environment of the South Pacific region and to establish the South Pacific nuclear-free of environmental pollution by radioactive wastes and other radioactive matter. region keep free zone to our We will continue to supplement these efforts as the need arises. Indeed, leaders at the recent South Pacific Forum meeting in Papua New Guinea adopted the Treaty on the Control and Movement of Hazardous and Toxic Wastes in the South Pacific. Samoa did not hesitate to sign it. Consistently over the years Samoa, together with our regional partners, has called for a permanent end to nuclear testing, the dumping of chemical and toxic wastes and the transportation of these materials in our waters. From this account you will therefore understand our deep shock and distress when it was announced in June that France proposed to resume the testing of nuclear weapons in the Pacific. We sought, at the highest level, as many others did, to persuade the Government of France not to do so. We took action to register our concern and to protest and we sought to intervene in the proceedings brought by New Zealand against France in the International Court of Justice. Together with other Forum countries we moved to make direct representation to the Government of France — all to no avail. The explosion of a nuclear device at Mururoa atoll early this month brings to close to 200 the number of underground nuclear tests France has carried out in the Pacific since 1975. Of the whole United Nations membership, Samoa is the closest to the test site. The resumption of nuclear testing by France has been made in the face of strong and persistent protest from countries of the region, and equally strong and overwhelming condemnation from all parts of the world. General Assembly Fiftieth session The current tests are being conducted in the absence of any environmental impact assessments that we know of or have been advised of, and in the opinion of my Government in disregard of Frances existing regional treaty obligations. Like other members of the South Pacific Forum, Samoa is outraged at the resumption of French nuclear testing in the Pacific — and, as I say, in the vicinity of my country. In the strongest possible terms we condemn it. We do so because of the extreme danger it poses to our environment and health, now and in the long term; and because the tests are completely contrary to the undertaking at the recent Non-Proliferation Treaty review Conference that nuclear States exercise utmost restraint in nuclear testing pending the completion of negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty that would ban nuclear tests for all time. We do welcome Frances a comprehensive test-ban treaty, but that should not be used as an excuse for France to continue its nuclear testing in our region. For the sake of our environment and all who live there, we call on France to stop. commitment to We call also, and once more, on the three nuclear Powers which have not yet signed and ratified the Protocols to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty to do so. It is also out of deep concern for our environment that Samoa has taken every step possible to be engaged in the negotiations and in the implementation of the international conventions relating to climate change, biodiversity, marine pollution and the conservation of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks. Global warming and the threat of sea-level rise are matters of the gravest concern to my country and our region. Recently, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that the warming of the global atmosphere is unlikely to be entirely due to natural causes. In other words, human activity is a definite cause that cannot be discounted. While this is not entirely unexpected, the latest indication from the IPCC bears out the inadequacy of current Convention commitments for Annex I parties, and underlines the essential correctness, and the urgency, of the Berlin Mandate issued from the first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. For its part, Samoa will continue to work together with countries of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) towards the early acceptance of clear emission-reduction targets of the type advanced in the draft AOSIS Protocol. 13th plenary meeting 29 September 1995 In respect of fish stocks, let me take the opportunity to pay tribute to all the countries that worked so hard to produce the truly remarkable triumph in the form of the draft Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. In particular, we express our gratitude to Ambassador Satya Nandan of Fiji for his exceptional skill and chairmanship. This has been a landmark year on many counts; with the fiftieth anniversary commemoration we will celebrate next month the crowning event. The Fourth World Conference on Women, in Beijing, is one such landmark. Samoa warmly applauds the unanimous adoption of the Platform for Action, and the remarkable degree of international consultation and cooperation that was employed to produce it. What is needed now is the highest degree of commitment and action, in close consultation with women at all levels. There would be little point in having yet another fine document without any prospect of implementation, and without the effort and the will to make concrete changes and improvements. And let it be remembered that such changes and improvements are not for women alone, but for the full development of mankind. doubt, the of Without extension the Non- Proliferation Treaty was a major achievement for the world community this year. We congratulate Ambassador Dhanapala of Sri Lanka on his remarkable role and leadership in ensuring the successful outcome of the Review Conference. and a The decisions we took then are essential to international peace and security, and the attainment of the ultimate goals of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control. The successful conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty by 1996 is a specific goal for the attainment of which all Member States of this body should strive with the utmost effort. treaty on general We pray that at the end of the presidency of Ambassador Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, the world community will be able to celebrate the accomplishment of that objective. 31 General Assembly Fiftieth session President The Acting from French): I now call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Colombia, His Excellency Mr. Rodrigo Pardo Garcia-Pena. (interpretation Mr. Pardo Garcia-Pena (Colombia)(interpretation from Spanish): On behalf of my Government I congratulate Mr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fiftieth session, a crucial time in the history of the Organization. I should like at the outset to express our full readiness to make a major contribution to the success of the deliberations under his leadership. I should also like to express our appreciation and gratitude to Minister Amara Essy of Cote dIvoire for his excellent performance as President of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session. The peoples of the world believed that the end of the cold war would bring peace and prosperity — and they are still waiting. Indeed the changes that have taken place in international relations have not been accompanied by changes of a similar magnitude in the relations between the industrialized North and the impoverished South. On the contrary, the situation of developing countries, far from having improved, is deteriorating further. The international trade system does not meet the expectations that there would be access to markets and transparency in the rules of the game. Poverty has not been reduced, social development and technological development of the South continues to lag and the external debt problem is still a heavy burden on our economies. standstill, scientific the a is at It is our duty now to realize the dream of those who wrote the San Francisco Charter — something that has been postponed for 50 years by a cold war and dozens of regional conflicts and overshadowed by the grief of the victims of armed conflicts. of The period transition through which the international system is passing should not lead us to accept so-called unilateral solutions to problems that are global in the emergence of a new era of nature nor to permit intervention in matters lie within the domestic jurisdiction of States. There is an imperative need to concert policies to face international problems and to foster constructive links between North and South. and coordinate strategies that 32 13th plenary meeting 29 September 1995 The United Nations, which was a stage for the cold in war, must now cooperate in eradicating poverty, making sustainable human development viable, in guaranteeing equality of rights between men and women and in giving full effect to human rights — in other words, it must work on behalf of human beings — all human beings — without distinction of any kind whatsoever. The United Nations has the responsibility to strive to make the hopes and expectations that arose at the end of the cold war a reality and not the source of new frustrations. The current situation requires a modern United Nations attuned to the new times, a pluralistic and democratic Organization that will be an instrument for the promotion of a world order that can make the right to development a reality and achieve peace. The building of a new international system to replace the hegemonic, weapons-based and unilateral practices of the past is a goal towards which we must work from within this Organization. The international system we aspire to create is one compatible with interdependence and autonomy, with the strengthening of the international organization and with full respect for the sovereign equality of States, one compatible with economic development and devoted to the significant improvement of the living conditions of the poorest segments of the population. and social justice equity, It is indispensable to forge a new economic model that can satisfy the needs of our people, one characterized by and competitiveness. At the same time, we are convinced that genuine and representative democracy, free from foreign interference, must be the key element in preserving peace and observing the basic principles of respect for the fundamental rights of the human person and of economic and social development. efficiency For the preservation of peace, security and international stability it is indispensable that the nuclear- weapon States immediately discontinue nuclear testing. In this regard, we deplore the that have been carried out, recent nuclear notwithstanding the opposition of the international community to that practice. responsibly tests and act Next month the Eleventh Summit Meeting of the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries will take place in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. My country looks forward to the attendance of leaders of developing General Assembly Fiftieth session nations and is prepared to shoulder the creative challenge of presiding over the Movement for the next three years. In recent decades, under the leadership of His Excellency President Soeharto of Indonesia, the Non- Aligned Movement adopted a new course, one in tune with current reality, abandoning the confrontational context in favour of cooperation as the central focus of its action. We shall continue to pursue that task with enthusiasm. With the same determination with which it succeeded in its struggle against colonialism, the non-aligned countries must now face the challenge of eradicating poverty and closing the vast gap between rich and poor and between developed and developing countries. In the twenty-first century non-alignment will mean a commitment to peace and to the well-being and progress of our peoples, as well as action against poverty and marginalization. to cooperation in dealing with global problems and a struggle for participation and against unilateralism and imposition. It will also entail a commitment reform of actively in the In facing the next century, non-alignment must participate international institutions, including the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions. Non-alignment must also promote the needed changes in the structures of cooperation and the dynamic modalities by which developed countries and international the implementation of projects and programmes of South-South cooperation. institutions resources provide for One of the global problems that calls for an effective multilateral strategy headed by the United Nations is that of illegal drugs. This is not an issue that can be dealt with by a single country or small group of nations. This is a transnational crime of vast proportions, overwhelming dimensions and the greatest perils. It is a crime without nationality. We Colombians have suffered more than anyone from the devastating effects of this problem. We have suffered death and corruption as a consequence of the huge profits to be derived from this illegal activity. We find it surprising, international community is not fully aware of the real nature and dimensions of the problem of illicit drugs. therefore, to note that the We are dealing with an illegal economic activity with dimensions that have been compared with those of the oil industry. It is seven or eight times greater than the gross 13th plenary meeting 29 September 1995 national product of a nation like Colombia; it operates in dozens of countries and entails a number of linked activities, including money laundering and the deviation of chemical precursors. Such linked activities generally take place in developed countries and are as important as the growing of coca leaves or their transformation into cocaine. an in Many studies indicate increase the consumption of illegal drugs in industrialized countries as well as an increase in new markets throughout the world. World statistics demonstrate that deaths from drug abuse have trebled since 1988 and that an increase of 1000 per cent has been observed in medical emergencies due to cocaine overdose between 1978 and 1993. My country has battled, with more success than any other, against the producers of and traffickers in illegal drugs. Colombia eradicated marihuana crops in the 1970s, destroyed the Medellin Cartel in the 1980s and dismantled the Cali Cartel in the 1990s. Colombia is responsible for more than 50 per cent of the poppy crops eradicated worldwide and for the confiscation of more than a quarter of the total amount of cocaine and cocaine base seized globally. The eradication of illegal crops in Colombia must be the accompanied by similar efforts to bring about eradication of marihuana crops in other countries, including in some industrialized countries in the North. During the first year of President Ernesto Sampers Administration, the anti-drug cartel policy has produced results that no prior administration in Colombia, or in any other nation, has been able to achieve. Thanks to Colombias success, the world now has a historic opportunity to defeat drug trafficking once and for all. Yet this opportunity could be missed if adequate measures are not immediately adopted to combat money laundering, the deviation of precursor chemicals and permissive consumption. My country has proposed creating a special unit of the Economic and Social Council to oversee measures of international cooperation, the adoption of an inter- American convention against money laundering and the convening in 1997 of an international conference to evaluate the results of the Vienna Convention and to make the necessary adjustments to it. 33 General Assembly Fiftieth session There is still time for the international community to face up to its responsibility to bring about the final defeat of this international scourge.
