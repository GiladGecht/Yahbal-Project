{"speech":{"0":" It is with great pleasure convey to you, Mr. President, my congratulations on your election to guide the work of this session of the General Assembly. At the same time I extend congratulations to the country that you represent with such distinction. Your outstanding qualities guarantee a competent presidency, which will certainly contribute to the success of our work. I should also like to express my special appreciation for the enlightened and committed leadership of your predecessor, Mr. Freitas do Amaral, who, in the course of the historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly, made an undeniable contribution to the continued progress of the United Nations. pursuit of the noble objectives of our Organization. It is with pleasure that I reiterate here the support of my country for his re-election. Cape Verde, being a small developing country that is particularly affected by drought and desertification, and without any means of defence, has every reason to place a great deal of hope in the success of the United Nations, particularly with respect to the fulfilment of the principles and the goals of its Charter, such as the promotion of peace and security, social and economic development, the protection and defence of the environment, human rights and international law. But small countries are not the only ones looking to the United Nations with hope. In todays world, when interdependencies are increasing and globalization is spreading to a growing number of sectors of humankinds activity, the existence and the work of our Organization is becoming more and more indispensable to all nations of the globe. international Governments are, in fact, more clearly aware of the need for through accommodation, they can reach consensus and decide on global policies, strategies and actions that, increasingly, are in the interests of the whole planet. in which, forums I also take this opportunity to express the highest appreciation of my delegation for the vision, initiative and determination that have characterized the work of the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in his However, no institution apart from the United Nations has the vocation or the capacity to respond to those needs, since, to a large extent, it is the architect of the international stage on which we are players today.

General Assembly Fifty-first session Under the auspices of the United Nations many results have been achieved in the search for solutions to the problems that afflict humankind. Spectacular progress has allowed human beings to take giant steps in science and technology. Nevertheless, there are still huge challenges to overcome, so that the ideals of the founders of the United Nations may triumph all over the face of the Earth. eternal illiteracy — the In reality, for many people peace is still a dream, and promises of the distribution of the dividends from the end of the cold war have become an illusion. Malnutrition, disease, of underdevelopment — still overpower nations, preventing them from developing to their full potential to the benefit of their populations. Similarly, in many countries human rights are flagrantly violated, women are marginalized, and children fall victim to maltreatment and exploitation. In other countries, ethnic groups are subject to persecution and systematic “cleansing”. partners At the same time, situations of tension, such as arms and drug trafficking, the internationalization of organized crime and an upsurge are becoming generalized. in terrorism, it But is necessary to bear in mind that such phenomena, both because of their origin and impact, can be fought efficiently only if there is a firm, unequivocal to improve international commitment by all States cooperation and better utilize resources within the framework of the United Nations. Cape Verde, due to its proximity to the Sahara desert, is particularly affected by ecological problems, since, like other continuous environmental degradation, which threatens the very survival of its population. countries of the Sahel, faces it in Africa, It is therefore natural for us to welcome with joy the adoption and entry into force of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought anor Desertification, Particularly its Regional Implementation Annex for Africa. The particular attention paid to Africa is clearly justified. This continent is, without the shadow of a doubt, the most affected by drought and the most threatened by the advance of desertification. The ecological balance of the African continent, one fourth of the area of the planet, is crucial to stabilize the environment as a whole. particular in 2 24th plenary meeting 7 October 1996 For that reason, the efforts that need to be made to prevent the desert from spreading must be shared by the entire international community. Cape Verde is therefore committed, together with other countries, to establishing an international mechanism with the aim of facilitating the implementation and financing of the aforementioned Convention. We stress the praiseworthy action, at the subregional level, of the Permanent Inter- State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel in coordinating efforts to fight drought and desertification. the projects and programmes of I should also like to underline the significant efforts made in this area at the national level in Cape Verde. The reforestation programme launched in the first years of my countrys independence continues with the same vigour 20 years later, and the results achieved are encouraging. Since the programme was launched, the area covered has gone from 7,413 to nearly 181,275 acres. I must also highlight the major support given by Cape Verdes development partners, without which it would not be possible to maintain the reforestation programme at its current pace, which is satisfactory to all. In spite of the success of this programme and of the efforts made, my country is still affected by the devastating consequences of drought. In fact, due to the lack of rainfall in July and the insufficient rain last August and September, Cape Verde faces a year of crop failure, which, once again, has given rise to anxiety and distress among Cape Verdes farmers. to make an unexpected effort Therefore, my Government will be forced, once again, to address the consequences of such a situation, which, of course, will have a negative impact on the development process. We therefore urge international solidarity with the people and Government of Cape Verde to help our country overcome the current farming crisis and ensure employment in the rural areas. and and The world is developing the countries globalization seeing the gap widen between countries. industrialized Economic of information and communications technology highlight existing differences. Restrictive immigration policies, which are associated with the spread of racism and xenophobia, are gathering speed day by day, which is disturbing to us. development General Assembly Fifty-first session Meanwhile, developing countries and, in particular, the least developed, face the consequences of accelerated population growth, which has direct repercussions on unemployment. The pursuit of full employment should be the top priority of social and economic policies aimed at bringing about development in order to provide all — men and women — with the chance to ensure that their means of subsistence are secure and long-lasting. Unfortunately, the international community is still reluctant to assume its responsibilities in such matters. A heavy burden thus falls upon the developing countries — the task of recovering from the delays resulting from an economic order that has not been, and still is not, in their favour. This burden is even heavier in view of the inexorable trend towards the reduction of financial flows to the least developed countries, both in official development assistance and foreign direct investment. In this regard, the Agenda for Development, aimed at supporting those countries in their efforts for recovery, should make urgent demands with regard to international cooperation for development. It should, at the same time, reaffirm the right to development as a main concern of the international community. The Agenda for Development cannot be seen as a mere enunciation of principles, but should be taken as a true charter of social and economic goals, with the United Nations playing a key role in its promotion and materialization. In order to prepare the United Nations for the challenges facing humankind as we approach the end of the century, we are committed to improving of the Organization by promoting and undertaking reforms with the aim of strengthening it and empowering it so that it is better able to fulfil the objectives of its Charter. There have been long and complex negotiations on the reform and restructuring of the United Nations system. This exercise has been characterized by its particular intensity and richness, aimed at adapting the institutions of our Organization to the new challenges that face humankind as we approach the end of the century. But we are close to the time when decisions of the utmost importance to the future of the United Nations will have to be taken. They will have to correspond, with due balance, to the concerns of large and small countries. What will certainly not be acceptable is a situation in which 24th plenary meeting 7 October 1996 reforms end up maintaining the differences that already exist today. We support the idea that reforms should reflect the deep changes that have taken place in the 50 years since the creation of the United Nations. There must be fair representation for all regions of the world in the decision-making bodies of the United Nations, particularly in the Security Council. In this regard, we recognize the need for Africa to be duly represented, namely with African countries as permanent members of the Council. We have all witnessed the successes, however relative, of the difficult talks on nuclear disarmament, in particular the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and the very recent adoption by the General Assembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which I had the honour and pleasure to sign on behalf of my country on 2 October 1996. We believe that these two documents provide a historic opportunity and a powerful impetus for the creation of conditions that will allow us to look with hope to the possibility, one day, of a world free of all nuclear weapons and of the nightmare of their use. The process of nuclear disarmament should, from now on, gain greater attention and follow-up. The signature in Cairo, on 11 April, of the Pelindaba Treaty, which is the conclusion of joint efforts made by the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations, marked the solemn pledge of the Governments and peoples of Africa to assume their share of the task of ridding the continent and the planet of nuclear weapons, in the same way as did the Governments of Latin America and the Caribbean in 1967, and those of the South Pacific in 1985. Cape Verde, which has consistently supported all efforts aimed at banning weapons of mass destruction, cannot but congratulate itself on the strengthening of international stability and security. Expectations were therefore raised in respect of the planned fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. We note that its mandate will be defined in the course of this session. We hope the special session will become a landmark in the creation of an atmosphere of relief and trust that will help us to reach the goal of eliminating weapons of mass destruction and reducing conventional armaments. A combination of historical, political, economic and climatic factors, among others, have given Africa the lowest level of development of any continent over the 3 General Assembly Fifty-first session for past three decades. Social and economic indicators are still negative, as are Africas prospects the future. Approximately 50 per cent of the population of our continent lives in a state of absolute poverty and that percentage will surely increase if quick and efficient solutions are not found to resolve this crisis. At the same time, as cause and consequence of this appalling scenario, we have witnessed a succession of bloody conflicts, bringing even greater poverty, disease and the degradation or even destruction of the environment. For this reason, so many important resources and capabilities that are essential to assessing and resolving the complex issues of development are being wasted and, very often, forever lost on the battlefields. But it is not only the countries directly involved in such conflicts that suffer the consequences. The tension brought about by the presence of armed groups across the borders of other States, refugees and displaced persons seeking shelter in neighbouring countries and very often the the environment, the spread of disease, the degeneration of moral values, the horror of suffering and behaviours far removed from human values are all situations not confined to the territorial limits of the States where conflicts occur. consequent destruction of the tragedy of It is therefore with deep sorrow that we witness the never-ending armed conflicts on our continent, despite the efforts of both the African and the international communities to put an end to them. Even when the parties involved seem to have reached an agreement for the re- establishment of peace, there are unjustified reversals that jeopardize the entire process. An example of this is the conflict that still exists in Angola, a country with which Cape Verde has deep ties not only of history and culture, but also of solidarity. We support the efforts of the Angolan Government and the international community to undertake all tasks aimed at bringing about a lasting peace, social stability and the normal functioning of institutions at the national level, without which the Angolan people will be unable to enjoy the tranquillity they rightfully deserve and the wealth they could and should benefit from, given the huge potential of their country. The need for joint action to end the nightmare of war in several regions of the African continent is becoming more and more urgent. The creation of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution was a far-sighted decision giving our continent 4 24th plenary meeting 7 October 1996 the autonomous ability to help resolve situations of violence and tension. Nevertheless, it is important to stress that, in keeping with the principles that are at the foundation of that Mechanism, its main aim is anticipation and prevention of conflicts. Peacekeeping and security in the world remain the primary responsibility of the United Nations Security Council, though there may be a justification in some situations for the involvement of the OAU in specific peacekeeping and observer missions. Addressing the causes of the conflicts, however, remains the most important issue. These causes are to be found essentially in the conditions of underdevelopment that persist in most of our countries. Such conditions nurture the seeds of violence and intolerance, are at the root of armed conflicts and block the establishment of structures to ensure democratic participation and its resulting human rights benefits. Key elements for the attainment of peace in Africa are therefore the promotion of lasting development, investment in human resources and ensuring that current processes of democratization are successful and widespread. It is imperative that such processes be duly supported so that they can consolidate and improve the living conditions of the population and stand up to possible coups de force or other such threats. The promotion and use of dialogue must be employed to resolve situations of civil strife and armed conflict. In the light of the dimension and scale of the in Africa and questions of problem of development security, we agree with the argument that Africa is currently the major challenge facing the United Nations. Development, security and peace are major concerns in the minds of the leaders of the continent and of all others interested in the future of Africa. These goals are interrelated and cannot be achieved separately. Of all the factors limiting the achievement of such objectives, the reduction of poverty is undoubtedly the one that must first be overcome through a strategy of sustainable development. Without the remaining economic and social goals cannot be achieved. The persistence of poverty is a constant threat not only to economic development, but also to the political and social stability of States and to the preservation of the environment. this, Another fact to bear in mind is that solutions for the problems of development in Africa should be designed thus making and managed on our own continent, General Assembly Fifty-first session responsibility for Africa dependent on the development of the countries thereof. In this context, Africa is currently deeply committed to the search for internal and lasting solutions to its problems, which in no way suggests a rejection of the technological and financial resources and contributions that we believe the international community should continue to make available so that we can overcome the major difficulties we still face. African countries are fully aware that they must take their destiny into their own hands and have been trying to implement measures that reflect their seriousness and hence worthiness to receive support in order to produce the expected results. Several African countries have been undertaking institutional reforms with the aim of opening up their markets, reducing the role of the State in the economy and strengthening the private sector in order to make it credible and able to generate employment. Such reforms, combined with democracy and the development of civil society, tend to promote thereby marshalling internal resources and encouraging foreign investment. and economic stability, social In this context, we must stress the importance of initiatives to promote greater foreign private investment, a source of and added value which is fundamental to ensuring the continuous and stable growth of African economies. employment Another important initiative in which Africa is engaged is the African Economic Community, which received a decisive boost in May 1994 when the Abuja Treaty entered into force. As a step in its implementation, the African countries are engaged in strengthening the regional integration of their economies through regional economic communities. first and social of Africa. development Last year, the Organization of African Unity adopted the Cairo Plan of Action to give new impetus to the economic Its food security, objectives — responsible management, development of human resources, the proper and effective use of natural resources, cooperation and economic regional integration — are ambitious but feasible. They depend upon the political will of Governments and their ability to marshal the internal means and external support to achieve these objectives. Mention should be made in this regard to the principles set out in the important decisions adopted or being prepared by the United Nations: the United Nations 24th plenary meeting 7 October 1996 New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s and the Agenda for Development. The Cairo Plan of Action also recalls the need for the adoption of measures limiting the negative impact of the Uruguay Round agreements on the development of Africa in general and of the least developed countries in particular, and urges creditors to be prepared to assist in finding ways to reduce the debt burden, particularly as regards the current levels of debt servicing. The recent mid-term review of the United Nations New Agenda was an opportunity for the international community to renew its commitment to measures aimed at adding new impetus to implementation, particularly as regards external debt, the diversification of African economies, greater access to markets and the transfer of technology. Africa sincerely hopes that that commitment, freely entered into by its partners, will be promptly fulfilled. it Although the current situation tends to raise very serious concerns, is nonetheless possible to find encouraging signs pointing to positive developments in the situation on the African continent from the point of view of economic growth and the consolidation of democracy. And these are more than mere signs; some examples of clear successes already visible in Africa in recent years show that is not heading exclusively towards chaos and destruction. It is necessary to find appropriate policies to manage these positive signs, policies which we must be courageous enough to implement. We are certain such actions will achieve results. it Although the signs are positive, they still do not reflect an irreversible trend. The burden of dependency resulting from past policies is still too heavy for Africa to reverse the situation on its own. Now more than ever, the international community, specialized agencies and the industrialized countries that are friends of Africa are called upon to strengthen financial and technical assistance to the continent so that underdevelopment can be definitively overcome. In this regard, we congratulate certain countries on their willingness to maintain their levels of cooperation with Africa. Cape Verde is also pleased to note the efforts and generosity of certain partners, including some from the South, on behalf of the development of our country. 5 General Assembly Fifty-first session 24th plenary meeting 7 October 1996 Cape Verde does not expect to be solely a beneficiary of the actions and initiatives of the United Nations. Despite its limitations and the fragility of its economy, my country wishes to contribute to the search for solutions to problems demanding our attention and to participate in those actions in which our presence is necessary. millennium holds for all Governments and peoples of the world.
