{"speech":{"0":" Let me begin by congratulating Mr. Razali Ismail on his assumption of the office of President of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session. I am confident that his valuable guidance will lead to the successful outcome of this session. He has the assurance of our full support. As an introduction, let me recall that this September marks the fifth anniversary of Estonias return to the international scene. It was five years ago that the Estonian blue, black and white tricolour was hoisted in front of this forum. That moment was equal in historic and emotional significance to the one 70 years earlier, in September 1921 in Geneva, when Estonia was welcomed as a new member of the League of Nations â€” an international organization whose history has taught the world many lessons. for The cold war is over. Nevertheless, the international community continues to seek further guarantees of a more secure future for our children and grandchildren. In this respect, Estonia would like to express satisfaction at the recent overwhelming support the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty adopted by the General Assembly. The signing ceremony at the United Nations on 24 September was an important milestone, a result of continued negotiations and at the same time a sign of hope for the future. We firmly believe that the Treaty can make an important contribution to preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and promoting international security. The United Nations must now give a clear response to people who want to live in a world free of any threats of nuclear weapons and other means of mass destruction. Our world is facing new challenges. These new challenges require a renewed United Nations. At the last session, considerable efforts were made to reform the Organization. This work will continue during the current session. In fact, one of the principal goals of the session ahead of us will be to increase the effectiveness of the United Nations. Estonia welcomes the progress made in this area. There are still a number of ways by which the United Nations can further improve its performance. We attach particular importance to the review of the working methods of the functional commissions and expert groups and bodies of the Economic and Social Council, as well as to better coordination between the work of the Second and Third Committees. 15th plenary meeting 30 September 1996 reform of Estonia is looking forward to active participation in United Nations-reform working groups. We attach specific importance to the financial the Organization. Estonia is supportive of the view that the United Nations should be put on a sounder financial footing. Member States should make every effort to fulfil their obligation to pay their arrears without any conditions. At the same time, we share the understanding that the United Nations scale of assessments should be revised. The new scale of assessments must be fair and more transparent. the fundamental principle of capacity to pay. We hope that the High-level Open-ended Working Group on the Financial Situation of the United Nations will achieve a comprehensive and consensus solution to the current financial difficulties of the Organization. should also better reflect It The reform of the Organization will also include changes in the composition and working methods of the Security Council. We welcome the decision by the General Assembly mandating the relevant Open-ended Working Group to submit a report to the General Assembly at its fifty-first session. At the same time, we hope that, along the lines of the mandate of the Working Group, Member States can bring about a resolution to the long-standing Council enlargement. discussions Security on Peacekeeping continues to be one of the important activities of the Organization. Recent years have seen a changing role for United Nations peacekeeping missions. Today they have grown into manifold and diversified types of action. A new challenge for United Nations peacekeepers is dealing with internal conflicts throughout the world. In this respect, I would like to reiterate that regional peacekeeping efforts that are conducted under the auspices of remain under stringent United Nations control. the United Nations must autumn we will Estonia is continuing to take part in United Nations peacekeeping. This increase our contribution to the United Nations peacekeeping forces by offering a company to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). The company will be deployed in the Norwegian battalion. The deployment is part of a joint project to develop a Baltic peacekeeping battalion. That battalion will be the contribution of the Baltic States to the strengthening of United Nations peacekeeping capacities. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the Governments that have contributed to this common Baltic project. 23 15th plenary meeting 30 September 1996 functioning of this machinery should rely on impartial reporting and disregard politically motivated allegations. Failure to do so would seriously damage the credibility of the Organization. Owing to very recent memories, this issue is of special importance to Estonia. This is also one of the reasons why Estonia lists among its priorities issues regarding indigenous peoples and human rights. it is essential Estonia believes that to secure adequate financing for the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for Human Rights. At the same time, we would like to point out that various regional organizations that focus on human rights issue periodic reports regarding such matters. In order to avoid duplication and to make effective use of resources, the United Nations human rights machinery should rely on the extensive expertise of regional organizations, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe. Those two organizations foster the basic foundations of security and stability in Europe. The United Nations should further enhance its ties with them, especially with the Council of Europe, the established stronghold of human rights on the European continent and a symbol of cooperation between nations striving for an open and mutually beneficial dialogue. Estonia, the current Chairman of the Council of Europe, is pursuing policies of positive engagement in relations with all countries, including our eastern neighbour. In this respect, it is our sincere hope that the Russian Federation will reciprocate our efforts. together with all Member States, In conclusion, let me underline our commitment to contribute, to the establishment of a world community in which individuals and States may live in peace and understanding. Let me express our sincere hope for a better world. "}}
