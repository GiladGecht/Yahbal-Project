{"speech":{"0":" Mr. President, please text accept our heartfelt congratulations on the assumption of your high office. Your unanimous election is a tribute to your great country, with which we enjoy friendly and fraternal relations. It is also a testimony to your diplomatic skills and personal standing in this world forum, where, on so many occasions, you have articulated most persuasively the concerns of the international community, particularly those of the marginalized and vulnerable. You are assured of the unstinting support of my delegation in the discharge of your very heavy responsibilities. I should like to convey to your predecessor, the President of the General Assembly at its historic fiftieth session, His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, our appreciation for a job well done. I should also like to pay a special tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. In a very Our political party, the Awami League, has only recently been returned to office, through the process of general elections, after a gap of more than 20 years. As was stressed by our leader at the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly, our total commitment to peace is born of the realization that only in an environment of peace can our people concentrate their energies and resources in combating the scourges of poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy and unemployment that still beset a large proportion of humankind. We naturally place special importance and emphasis on the development of good- neighbourly relations with the countries of our region, on the basis of universally accepted principles of peaceful coexistence, mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in each others internal affairs. We identify wholeheartedly with the aspirations and hopes of developing countries in general, particularly those belonging to the Non-Aligned Movement, and share a special affinity with the fraternal member States of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). We share with our development partners the goal of improving the quality of life of our people, and our relations with them are of the greatest significance to us. 5 General Assembly Fifty-first session 26th plenary meeting 8 October 1996 The existence of friendly and good-neighbourly relations does not necessarily preclude the emergence of problems. What these can ensure, however, is that the best of political will, goodwill and good intentions are brought to bear in seeking solutions to any outstanding problems or any new ones that may arise. Such an approach would go a long way towards resolving any differences or disputes. international convention on freshwater resources along the lines of those that already exist on biodiversity, ozone depletion and climate change. In particular, the paper stresses that the United Nations should develop principles and ethics on sharing the joint planetary freshwater resources. These are ideas that, in our view, warrant serious consideration by the world community. Our outstanding problem with India over the sharing of the waters of the Ganges River is not unknown to this forum. Water resources play a predominant role in the socio-economic development of a country. For Bangladesh, the availability of fresh river water in adequate volumes is indispensable for purposes of agriculture, irrigation, fisheries, and environmental balance and preventing the intrusion of salinity. The importance that we attach to this issue cannot be overemphasized and we have resumed bilateral in an atmosphere of mutual discussions with India, confidence and trust, to resolve this vexed problem amicably and equitably so that our legitimate concerns can be met. traffic, maintaining river ecological On the subject of water resources, I should like to digress a little from the purely national and also bilateral context, because the shortage of fresh water resources is not, let me emphasize, unique or peculiar to Bangladesh or our region. Even from the international perspective, it is an issue of primal significance. According to a recent strategy paper of the Committee on Natural Resources of the Economic and Social Council, by the year 2025, 52 countries with a total population of more than 3 billion people will be water-stressed or face chronic water scarcity. The problem has as much to do with the availability of fresh water in the overall global context as with the fact that such resources, even when available in abundant quantities, may be found in the wrong places or are available at the wrong times. The problem, therefore, is intimately and intricately linked to efficient water management. The question of water is not new to the global agenda and, since the Mar del Plata Conference in March of 1977, there have been international programmes on water-related issues. It has not, however, in our view, received the priority that it deserves. An international code of conduct for water-sharing was provided for in the Mar del Plata Action Plan and, as the strategy paper of the Committee on Natural Resources suggests, an international code of water ethics is needed more urgently today than ever before as a guide to help countries in their efforts to reach bilateral and multilateral agreements. The paper also suggests an 6 Reverting to the subject of our Governments priorities, let me just add that, in the domestic sphere, like all other developing countries, we are striving for a human development paradigm that will prioritize people, especially the most vulnerable and disadvantaged sectors. We will pursue a programme of reforms with emphasis on our domestic considerations: poverty alleviation and economic growth with social justice. The social sectors will receive special attention. The 1990s has been a period of democratic renewal. Our Government firmly believes that it is as important, and perhaps more difficult, to live up to great principles and ideas as to fight for their realization. That is why we shall strive to strengthen our polity through institutions and laws. Through constitutional amendment, an important innovation for democratic institutions and practice was effected in Bangladesh, following overwhelming popular demand, prior to our general elections in June. Three months before general elections are to be held, the Government will demit office and hand over power to a non-partisan and neutral caretaker Government to be headed by the most recently retired Chief Justice of the country and comprised of eminent apolitical personalities appointed on his advice, keeping in mind the sensitivities of the major political parties. The principal mandate of the caretaker Government will be to ensure free and fair general elections to be conducted by an independent constitutional authority, the Election Commission. Foreign observers were welcome to observe the electoral process, completely unhindered, in 1996 and 1991. Reports submitted by international observers can be of help in identifying any shortcomings or gaps that may exist and also contain constructive suggestions for improvement. These steps are the national equivalents of confidence- building measures between and among States. Democracy, of course, goes well beyond the holding of periodic general elections. It is a continuous process and even a culture and ethos, which above all denote a certain approach and attitude to governance. We in Bangladesh see democracy as more than a laudable and General Assembly Fifty-first session desirable objective. In the long term, democratic and accountable government affords the most efficacious and stable medium to develop the economy of a State and to achieve prosperity for its people. The very apposite point has been made, however, that democracy cannot on its own be a panacea for the diverse problems that confront many countries. There must also be effective international cooperation economic environment if the major socio-economic problems are to be meaningfully addressed. supportive external and a The cold war is now truly behind us and the object now is to win the peace. Peace is not simply the absence of war, but should encompass every human condition, necessity and amenity that make for a civilized and dignified life. It is inseparable from security and is the flip side of development. Political, economic and social issues are today intimately and intricately intertwined. Political internationalism without economic internationalism can only be likened to a house built upon sand. Most emphatically in this day and age of interdependence, no nation can achieve its fullest development alone. This is an area where the United Nations and the United Nations system clearly have a constructive role to play. The main purposes of the United Nations, as outlined in Chapter I of the Charter, include the achievement of international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character and also to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends. The Bretton Woods institutions are, of course, major players in the field of development policy and research. There is also, in our view, a patent need and ample justification in the Charter provisions for the United Nations and the United Nations system to play a meaningful role in global macroeconomic policy and strategy formulation. The United Nations is the universal forum for dialogue and decisions on such issues. This is an area in which, in particular, a revitalized Economic and Social Council can play a constructive and fruitful role. While the United Nations focus on operational, welfare and humanitarian activities, there is certainly a need for greater harmony and coordination between the United Nations systems on the one hand and the Bretton Woods institutions on the other. role provides economic special On the subject of development, let me reaffirm that a is an indispensable supportive external environment to national efforts and policies. Poverty is supplement arguably the prime source of world disorder and needs to 26th plenary meeting 8 October 1996 be addressed, inter alia, through sustained and enhanced flows of resources from the North to the countries of the South. The gap between North and South is widening at an ominous rate. In 1890, the wealth of each European was twice that of a South Asian. Today, the gap is 70- fold. In 1960, the per capita gross national product of the richest 20 per cent of States was 30 times higher than that of the poorest 20 per cent. By 1989, the gap had widened to 60 times. By 1994, only four countries members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) had reached the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as official development assistance. The average figure for DAC countries actually fell from 0.31 per cent in 1993 to 0.30 per cent in 1994. The least developed countries share of world trade has plummeted in two decades from 0.8 per cent to a mere 0.4 per cent. initiatives of The problems of the 48 least developed countries continue to deserve special consideration on the global development agenda. The Mid-term Global Review of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s has pointed to the limited progress made in the implementation of commitments by our development partners. The development the least- developed countries are stunted by problems associated with formidable structural adjustment programmes, the decline of an already low level of development resources, and the extremely low level of exports compounded by limited market access. The debt-relief measures taken thus far have remained grossly inadequate. We urge our development partners to adopt specific and concrete measures to redress these problems. We welcome the statements of several delegations that asked the removal of barriers on the products of the least developed countries. We believe that, at the forthcoming Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade Organization in December, every participant will work to remove all obstacles to trade from this vulnerable group of countries. The problems of developing countries are also, at one remove, the problems of the whole world, because prosperity, like peace and stability, is in the final analysis indivisible. For developed countries, assistance to the countries of the South will surely constitute an investment in a more secure, stable and, I have no doubt, eventually prosperous third world. The marginalization of developing countries would be morally indefensible, politically self- defeating and economically counter-productive. The aspirations of the South and the prosperity of the North are emphatically not mutually exclusive. 7 General Assembly Fifty-first session As the first United Nations Secretary-General put it, the United Nations was as strong an Organization as the representatives in San Francisco could agree upon. Half a century later, the United Nations remains the indispensable linchpin of any international order, a role for which it is uniquely conditioned, equipped and mandated. I should like to stress here that an effective and credible United Nations is even more vital and relevant for the smaller and more vulnerable States than for the more powerful ones. In todays vastly altered world, the United Nations and its system offer even broader promise than what its founding fathers could have envisioned. However, like all organizations, the United Nations system is also subject to the Darwinian dictum of “adapt or perish”. Much thought, effort and work are therefore being devoted to the goal of making the United Nations more attuned and responsive to changing times and requirements, charting its future course and defining its new emphases and priorities. The United Nations areas of responsibility should clearly cover problems or issues between States, especially those that are pandemic in range and global in consequence. Environmental degradation, human rights, burgeoning populations, the situation and rights of women and children, the depletion of non-renewable natural resources, drugs, migration, terrorism and corruption in international business could very well — in addition to issues of international peace, security and development — be the topical objects of United Nations policies and actions. We would, of course, want a United Nations that is streamlined and focused, open and accountable, with professional management systems and structures. international On the subject of Security Council reform, a number of proposals have been mooted, including a wide-ranging one by Italy. There is a broad convergence, if not consensus, on the idea that the overall size of an expanded Council should not exceed a figure in the low or mid- twenties. An agreement as to whether expansion should cover only the non-permanent category or both categories of seats, or could even include a new semi-permanent category, still continues to elude us. It is our view that three aspects of the issue should be given priority. Firstly, the smaller and the more vulnerable States that by definition pose no threat to international security have the most vital stakes in the United Nations. Their interests and concerns may not be overlooked in any restructuring of the Council. Experience also shows that smaller countries with no vested interests have played a more constructive role as Council members in general. 8 26th plenary meeting 8 October 1996 Secondly, the objective of any reform and restructuring should be a more effective and dynamic Council. Nothing should be allowed to detract from this. Thirdly, the moral dimension in determining criteria for possible new categories of membership or for any should be given due addition to permanent ranks consideration. This would include countrys commitment to the principles and purposes of the Charter, to democratic government and the essential freedoms, human rights and, in general, respect for United Nations decisions. a The Secretary-General is the most visible symbol and personification of the United Nations and the United Nations system. We see him as something more than the chief administrative officer of the Organization, as stipulated in the Charter, because he also has important political responsibilities. A former Secretary-General was of the view that the Secretary-General should be of help in “filling any vacuum that may appear in the systems which the Charter and traditional diplomacy provide for the safeguarding of peace and security”. While efforts are being made to enhance the effectiveness of the General Assembly, the Security Council and the operational arms of the United Nations system, we could perhaps consider ways of strengthening the office of Secretary-General. One idea that we would commend for consideration is the establishment of a committee, along the lines of the General Committee of the General Assembly, that the Secretary-General could consult, informally, collectively or by individual member, on important administrative and political issues. Such a committee would serve useful purposes, particularly in ensuring the rightful role of the General Assembly. formally or First, it would ensure closer interaction and exchange between the Secretary-General and the General Assembly. Secondly, the benefit of dispassionate counsel and a feel the thinking of Member States on issues in an institutional manner. And, it would make for greater transparency in decision-making. it would provide the Secretary-General for thirdly, The objective of any reform and restructuring is exercise is a strengthened United Nations its mandate. institutionally better equipped to fulfil Reforms, however, can only supplement, not be a that General Assembly Fifty-first session substitute for the political will to do what is right and warranted by the purposes and principles and other provisions of the Charter. Over the years, when the United Nations has floundered or failed, the predominant reasons were more often, unfortunately, the lack of political will rather than insuperable local difficulties or institutional lacunas. I should like to touch very briefly upon the dismal financial situation of the United Nations, which has become very serious indeed. Member States have every right and even a duty to demand the best value for their money. The United Nations, however, must be provided the wherewithal to discharge its responsibilities. We welcome the United States commitment to meet its financial obligations to the United Nations and to pay its arrears over a five-year period. Some interesting suggestions on United Nations reform have emanated from the Group of Seven Summit in Lyon earlier this year. These envisage some savings from the removal of overlap, improvement in the effectiveness of some agencies and commissions, and consolidation and rationalization of certain programmes. I have no doubt that the Fifth Committee and perhaps the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions will look closely at these proposals. We, of course, welcome the suggestion that any savings from such reforms are planned to be reinvested in development programmes. in 1992, A more realistic perspective of the expenditures incurred by the United Nations is afforded by comparing the United Nations budget with expenses incurred in certain activities by national or even local Governments. For example, the United Nations regular assessed budget was about the size of the New York City Fire Department budget. In 1994, the cost of the entire United Nations system, including all emergency operations, was over $10 billion, or about $2 per capita of the planets population. The expenditure on arms in the same year was about $150 per capita. While every scope and avenue for greater cost- effectiveness should be explored, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the United Nations gives good value for money. Expenditures on peacekeeping and the United Nations system are in a real sense an investment in peace and security. 26th plenary meeting 8 October 1996 there is an priority. With the end of the cold war, increasing awareness of the need to address this issue in all earnestness. The indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) last year and the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty by an overwhelming majority in the General Assembly are welcome steps towards the ultimate goal of nuclear disarmament. The International Court of Justice, in its recent Advisory Opinion on the issue of nuclear weapons, stressed the obligation “to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control”. (, para. 182 (f)) Like chemical and biological weapons, nuclear weapons must be outlawed. In the post-cold-war world, they have became an anachronism. They do not enhance international security and can only imperil world peace. For Bangladesh, the pursuit of general and complete disarmament is a fundamental principle of State policy. As a new member of the Conference on Disarmament, we are fully prepared to play a constructive role towards this goal. Bangladesh, together with most members of the G-21, has submitted a proposal in the Conference on Disarmament on the elimination of nuclear weapons. This has been circulated as a Conference on Disarmament document. We accept that substantial reductions are being made under START I and START II in the nuclear two major nuclear Powers. The arsenals of uncomfortable fact remains, however, that even after START II is completed by the year 2003 at the latest, there will still be more nuclear warheads in existence than in 1970, when the NPT came into force. The need to move speedily towards a third START treaty and beyond is very obvious. the successes Peacekeeping continues to be a most significant area of United Nations activity. The United Nations has indeed achieved some notable in peacekeeping missions in recent times, examples of which include those in El Salvador, Cambodia, Haiti, Mozambique and Angola. Bangladesh is proud to play an active role in United Nations peacekeeping activities. Our peacekeepers have shed their blood and sacrificed their lives in the cause of peace throughout the world. Disarmament has always been accorded a very high priority in the United Nations. In particular, the question of nuclear disarmament has always received the highest There is room for cautious optimism on the issue of the Bosnia and Herzegovina. We sincerely hope that Dayton Agreement will be implemented in its entirety and 9 General Assembly Fifty-first session 26th plenary meeting 8 October 1996 that a genuine peace will return to that beleaguered region. Bangladesh will continue to support all efforts towards this objective through regional as well as multilateral forums. "}}
