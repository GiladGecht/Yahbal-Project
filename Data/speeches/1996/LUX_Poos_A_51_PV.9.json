{"speech":{"0":" Allow me first of all to congratulate the President most warmly on his election to serve as President of the fifty-first session of the General Assembly. I also wish to convey my thanks to the previous President, Mr. Freitas do Amaral, for the commitment, skill and poise with which he led our work at the last session of the Assembly. I would also like to convey my appreciation to our for his Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, The views of the Luxembourg Government on the major international issues are the same as those expressed by our European Union partners. They were presented to the Assembly yesterday morning by Mr. Dick Spring, President of the Council and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ireland. the signature Luxembourg learned with great satisfaction that our General Assembly, by an overwhelming majority, had adopted and opened for resolution containing the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Yesterday, on behalf of the Luxembourg Government, I signed that document, which marks substantial progress towards the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the creation of a safer and more humane world. I hope that the parties concerned will continue to work to create the right conditions for the rapid entry into force of this Treaty. Also in the area of disarmament, I support without reserve the United Nations work on the question of anti- personnel landmines, which day after day, long after the guns have fallen silent in a conflict, continue to claim countless victims. If there is any evil which must be eradicated, this is it. I rejoice in the significant progress which has been achieved, in less than a year, in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. I welcome the holding of elections on 14 September, which marks a decisive stage for the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnians, Serbs and Croats must now organize their cooperation by first setting up common institutions. I regard these elections as a first, important step in the framework of a process of democratization and stabilization that must be carried further. Its success will depend above all on the Bosnian parties. It will also depend on neighbouring countries, in particular Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Lastly, it will depend on the support of the international community. My is in favour of continued international Government civilian and military action in order to create the environment required to preserve peace and prevent a return to war. Luxembourg is concerned by the check to the peace process in the Middle East that has followed the change of Government in Israel. We take the view that there is 13 General Assembly Fifty-first session no alternative to this complex and fragile process: the fruit of arduous negotiations. We urge our friends in Israel to pursue this process, to comply with and execute the commitments undertaken pursuant to the Oslo agreements and to avoid creating fresh obstacles. We fear that any other policy may generate further tension and once again trigger a spiral of violence that would inflict suffering on all the peoples of the region. The alarming events that took place on the West Bank today threaten to destroy the results of several years of effort to achieve a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. The Luxembourg Government condemns the recent attacks launched by the Government of Saddam Hussein on the Kurdish population of northern Iraq. It was inevitable that measures would be taken to react to this fresh offensive. We call for a complete withdrawal of Iraqi forces and for full respect for the territorial integrity of Iraq. We hope that the “oil-for-food” resolution may take place without delay in order to relieve the hardships suffered by the civilian population of that country. the implementation of The situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa, in particular in Burundi, continues to give us the greatest cause for concern. I fully support the efforts of the United Nations, in close cooperation with the Organization of African Unity, to avert both the occurrence in Burundi of a tragedy such as occurred in Rwanda and a deterioration of the situation which could plunge the region into war. Mr. Salifou (Niger), Vice-President, took the Chair. Over the last year, the United Nations has substantially cut the number of its peace-keeping operations. This reduction in our activities and the set-backs that we have witnessed in the past should not, however, diminish our efforts to enhance the United Nations capacity to avert, prevent the spread of and halt conflicts, and to save human lives. It is utterly unfair to criticize the United Nations whenever a peace-keeping operation runs into difficulties. Many of the shortcomings attributed to the United Nations could be resolved if all Member States undertook to pay their contributions to our Organization and, especially, make available to it the resources that it needs. For this reason, Luxembourg supports the ongoing work and reflection aimed at equipping the Organization with a rapid- intervention force that would enable it to react to crises in a timely fashion. Where non-military means have failed, it should be possible to deploy well-trained and properly 14 9th plenary meeting 25 September 1996 equipped peace-keeping contingents in the field very promptly in order to give practical effect to the Security Councils decisions. Greater responsibility should henceforth be given to regional organizations. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is nowadays playing a leading role in conflict management in Europe and the Caucasus. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in the former Yugoslavia and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in the Great Lakes region are doing the and subregional organizations in Africa, Latin America and elsewhere are performing similar tasks with the support of the United Nations. same. Other regional International security begins with the security of the individual, with respect for his fundamental rights and his protection against any violation of those rights, including the actions of his own Government. Nothing, therefore, can justify violations of human rights, which by their very nature have universal value. Our Organization plays an important role in developing international machinery designed to provide effective protection for human rights. This role takes the form, among others, of the efforts to carry out systematic investigations and enquiries with a view to sanctioning those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law and human rights. Luxembourg an international criminal court, which would be a decisive step forward in ensuring respect for the principles of international law. supports creation the early of instrument an invaluable Among the most vulnerable human beings are our children, and they therefore deserve special protection. The adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child marks a major advance. Scrupulously applied, that Convention will be in safeguarding children against physical and psychological violence. In 1995 my Government proposed to the United Nations a similar, indeed, a complementary initiative, to eliminate the exploitation of child labour. I welcome this Assembly adoption of that proposal designed to come to the aid of the tens of millions of children forced to work from an early age. This effort should be strengthened and further pursued. Luxembourg also hails the results of the Stockholm World Congress on the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children. My Government is resolved to foster international cooperation in the prevention and suppression of sexual exploitation of children in order to and safeguard children at effectively protect the international level against such criminal practices. General Assembly Fifty-first session 9th plenary meeting 25 September 1996 The globalization of the world economy is bringing about profound changes in international relations. A veritable revolution in information and communication technologies reducing geographic distances to nothing has led to a speeding up of business transactions and financial flows, as well as increased integration of markets. Generally accepted ideas have been turned upside down, and serious questions have been raised even among industrialized countries, where unemployment has grown to alarming proportions. decided to increase year by year its contribution to cooperation for development. Our intention is to achieve the target of devoting 0.7 per cent of our gross national product to official development assistance before the end of this decade. A significant portion of these funds will be made available to the various funds and programmes of the United Nations system. This is not simply a question of solidarity and social justice on a world scale; it is, above all, a preventive policy designed to contribute, however modestly, to peace by encouraging development. on the remain sidelines countries At the same time, we note that a significant number of developing of development and remain in great poverty. At a time when our Organization proclaimed 1996 International Year for the Eradication of Poverty, more than 1.5 billion human beings continue to live in a state of absolute poverty. We cannot remain indifferent to this situation. What should particularly disturb us is the inequality gap, which is widening both within countries and between the countries of the North and the South. This is a dangerous source of new tensions and conflicts. The United Nations Development Programmes latest report on human development speaks of worldwide social fragmentation. It underscores the widening disparities between rich and poor States and increased imbalances in societies between inhabitants of the same country. The population explosion and uneven access to the fruits of technological progress further compound these distortions. This increasingly massive migrations within countries and from poor countries to richer ones. likely to trigger trend is In order to remedy this situation, I propose to develop a new strategy based on four main courses of action. First, we should provide follow-up to, and translate into operational activities, the results of the major conferences held since the beginning of this decade in Rio, Vienna, Cairo, Copenhagen, Beijing and, most recently, in Istanbul. The World Food Summit scheduled by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) for November session on sustainable development in the spring of 1997 are also opportunities to define an integrated programme of action to foster human development. and the special Secondly, we must halt the persistent decline of funds made available for development, a symptom of “donor fatigue”. In each of our countries we must launch a new movement of solidarity to benefit the poorest and least developed countries. The Government of Luxembourg has The third main course of action is to strengthen the United Nations capacity to act in the economic and social field. That strengthening requires courageous reforms of its structures. Above and beyond the proposals of the Summit of major industrialized countries at Lyon, which I welcome, I advocate a single rigorous coordination structure for all economic and social activities and, especially, a concerted restructuring of the bodies and mandates concerned. In this context, I note with interest, the proposal of the Socialist International, which took place recently in this very building, calling for the setting up of integrated economic institutions on the regional and international levels and for the setting up of a United Nations economic security council. the XX Congress of of those reinforces, in sense, organizations in a international Fourthly, we must develop cooperation with the representatives of organized civil society, which is to say, the non-governmental organizations.The participation of non-governmental international the political organizations legitimacy bodies. The representatives of civil society nowadays play a key role in the activities of the United Nations system, whether in in the promotion of human rights and democracy, humanitarian for development. They make an invaluable contribution not only to the Organizations operational activities but also to its thinking processes, as attested to by the significant participation of non-governmental organizations in the preparation, holding and follow-up of the major world conferences organized by the United Nations. cooperation assistance or in This new dimension of our work was also highlighted at the congress of the World Federation of United Nations Associations, whose fiftieth-anniversary meeting, I am proud to note, was held in Luxembourg a little over a month ago. The financial situation of our Organization continues to be a matter of grave concern. As of July, the United 15 General Assembly Fifty-first session Nations cash flow was exhausted, and this situation can only worsen between now and the end of the year. Any attempt at a radical reform of the system will be futile if we continue to neglect the fundamental need to put it on an adequate and reliable financial footing. The United Nations cannot discharge its important responsibilities effectively if it is reduced to constant worry about making ends meet. Admittedly, the Organization could do even more to control its expenditure and enhance its effectiveness. Greater attention should be given, inter alia, to the question of establishing each States assessed contribution, which should be based on objective criteria and reflect each countrys real ability to pay. However, the crisis will be overcome only if each Member State fulfils its obligations by making full, timely and unconditional payment of its financial contribution. I therefore unreservedly support the proposals made by the European Union in this regard. significance. Within our Organization, In the ongoing reform process, one aspect is of particular the Security Council bears unique responsibilities as the organ entrusted with preventing and resolving conflicts.One of the greatest lessons to be learnt from the experiences and setbacks of recent years is that Security Council members must, if they wish to preserve its credibility, demonstrate their determination to enforce their decisions, once taken. The credibility and effectiveness of the Council with regard to peace-keeping and international security will be reinforced by the establishment of more open, transparent and collegial decision-making processes while maintaining close consultation with the countries supplying materiel and contingents. The not-insignificant progress made in this respect in the recent past should be integrated into the system. its decisions, would also benefit to contribute in membership. The enlargement of In addition, the Councils legitimacy, and probably the from a quality of readjustment the Council should take into account the ability of member States to peace-keeping and to the achievement of the Organizations goals. A better balance must be struck between industrialized and developing countries. The passing of the bipolar world has freed our planet from the ideological, political and military fetters that impeded to an extraordinary degree our capacity to act. Relieved of the threat of global confrontation and nuclear 16 9th plenary meeting 25 September 1996 holocaust, we are now faced with a series of worldwide problems, old and new, that includes underdevelopment, environmental degradation, the proliferation of all kinds of weapons, terrorism, ethnic conflicts, drug trafficking, violence and crime in all its guises. Luxembourg is convinced that the solution to those problems lies not in isolationism, nor in nationalism, nor in fundamentalism of any description. We would also be deluding ourselves were we to put our trust solely in the market and private initiative to remedy all humanitys ills. Only through an approach based on cooperation, solidarity, tolerance and mutual esteem can we tackle those problems successfully at both the regional and the world levels. This has been the approach of the European Union and its member States, which have succeeded in attaining, in Europe, a level of stability and prosperity hitherto unknown. The approach is based on the concept of democracy and of a market economy that is not uncontrolled but socially responsible, one in which the State fully shoulders its responsibilities in the areas of health, education and social justice. The system requires constant adjustments, but its principles and bases are not subject to debate. Other parts of the world have also successfully entered into a process of cooperation and regional integration. On the world level, the United Nations is the only truly universal Organization. We must work at this level to make a contribution vital to the solution of global problems, one that will complement the efforts being made at the regional level. That is the new and important responsibility that became evident in the course of the events and meetings that occurred the world over in commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations last year. There was emphasis on the need to set up new structures and to reform the United Nations, to give it the requisite capacity for review, action and cooperation. It is our hope that, with a heightened awareness of the interests of all mankind we, the representatives of the States Members of the United Nations, will succeed in displaying the vision, courage and political resolve needed to make our Organization an effective instrument capable of facing the challenges of the third millennium. General Assembly Fifty-first session The Acting from French): I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of South Africa, His Excellency Mr. Alfred B. Nzo. (interpretation President Mr. Nzo (South Africa): I should like first to extend warm congratulations to Mr. Razali Ismail on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session. We have no doubt that the session will benefit from his known skills as he discharges his responsibilities. I should also like to commend Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral for the excellent work done during his term of office. I should also like to express to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our continued confidence in his guidance of the Organization. Allow me at the outset of this, my first opportunity to speak before the General Assembly, to express the deep gratitude and appreciation of the people and Government of South Africa for the decision taken by the Assembly at the fiftieth session to relieve the new democratic Government of South Africa of the burden of the contribution to the United Nations budget accumulated over the period of two decades when the apartheid regime was excluded from participating in the work of the General Assembly. We recognize that that action involved considerable sacrifice, both for the United Nations and for its Member States, and that it was also consistent with the historic commitment of support for our struggle for democracy. South Africa remains committed to achieving a world free of all weapons of mass destruction and to addressing the issue of the proliferation of conventional weapons. We therefore welcome the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which we signed yesterday. for Our support the CTBT as an instrument of disarmament and non-proliferation is based upon the view that this Treaty is an integral part of a process which will lead to the full implementation of the nuclear-disarmament obligations set out in article VI of the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. An important milestone along this road was the adoption of the Pelindaba Treaty creating the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. This Treaty will contribute greatly to measures aimed at achieving a world free from nuclear weapons. Further steps are needed in the process to the bring the world closer to the ultimate goal of 9th plenary meeting 25 September 1996 elimination of nuclear weapons. The next step is for African States to cooperate with parties to the other nuclear-weapon-free-zones in the Pacific and Latin American regions with a view to promoting a southern hemisphere-wide nuclear-weapon-free zone. We are heartened by the unprecedented step of four nuclear- weapon States signing the relevant Protocols of the Pelindaba Treaty simultaneously with African States in April 1996, while the fifth has indicated that it will sign shortly. South Africa, as stated previously in other forums, will also work for the commencement next year of negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. South Africa also supports and will work for the establishment of an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament in the Conference on Disarmament. This committee can identify and negotiate the necessary steps by which we can achieve the ultimate goal of the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons. We also look forward to the the Chemical Weapons Convention by those States that have not yet done so. early ratification of It is not just the threat posed by all weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery that is of serious concern to my Government, but also the build-up of conventional weapons beyond a level which can be considered legitimate for the purposes of self-defence. Conventional weapons are, in fact, the cause of most of the deaths and suffering of millions of people in conflicts around the world today. My Government would therefore like to encourage all States Members of the United Nations to support and participate in the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms, and lend active support to General Assembly resolution B on small arms and its panel of governmental experts mandated to assist the Secretary- General to prepare a report on small arms. We would also encourage Member States to support the worldwide efforts to secure the elimination of anti-personnel landmines. In order to alleviate the suffering caused by landmines, my Government is committed to reinforcing international cooperation. As a country with advanced demining technology, we are pleased to be making a modest contribution to international efforts to unearth landmines. South Africa will continue to cooperate in the the various non-proliferation of the technologies and equipment which international forums dedicated to 17 General Assembly Fifty-first session could be used in the development of weapons of mass destruction, and in discouraging any destabilizing build up of conventional weapons. Our harrowing experience under the tyranny of apartheid has imposed a duty on us to place a high premium on the promotion of human rights. In this regard, our Constitution contains an entrenched and fully justiciable Bill of Rights. In addition, plans are advanced for the establishment of an office on the status of women to provide a mechanism within the Government to act as a monitor to ensure that a gender perspective is integrated into all publicly-funded policies and programmes. The South African Government regards it as a priority to contribute to the efforts of the international community to combat the violation of human rights. In South Africa, and in the region as a whole, processes of democratization have released a host of productive human and political resources. This has, in many ways, contributed to the achievement of peace, security and stability in our region. Our vision for southern Africa is one of the highest possible degree of economic cooperation, mutual assistance and the joint planning of regional development initiatives, leading to full economic integration. Civil conflicts have ravaged many parts of Africa. We welcome the positive developments which have taken place in Rwanda and Sierra Leone. However, serious conflict persists in Liberia, Burundi and Somalia. The South African Government is committed to playing an active role in the ongoing efforts of the international community to assist the people of Burundi to bring about lasting peace and national reconciliation. President Mandela recently appointed a special representative for Burundi, who has been given the task of searching for a viable solution in close coordination with other special representatives and with countries in the region. These efforts need to be supplemented by close cooperation between the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations. tentative so far, towards peace At the same time, we are heartened by the progress, albeit in Angola. Representatives of Member countries assembled here will agree that the people of Angola deserve peace at last as an instrument for — or rather, as an important ingredient of — embarking economic development and social advancement. Our Government commends the efforts of the United Nations, and especially those of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General sustainable to on the road 18 9th plenary meeting 25 September 1996 for Angola, Maitre Alioune Blondin Beye, who has with tremendous patience and commitment guided the Angolan peace process to the stage where it is today. We owe it to the people of Angola to see this process through to its logical conclusion. Through the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution, member States of the OAU are collectively committed to restoring peace and security on our continent. In support of the OAU mechanism, we are pleased the Southern African Development Community has recently created an organ on politics, defence and security. These efforts reflect Africas primary concern with issues of preventive diplomacy and conflict resolution. that South Africa welcomed the spirit of dialogue and realism that had begun to characterize the relations between Israel and Palestine and was hopeful that this positive development would gradually replace the centuries of conflict in the Middle East. That hope was further reinforced by the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements reached in Oslo. My Government recent developments in the Middle East are likely to reverse and jeopardize the peace process. We therefore urge all the players in the Middle East to rise to the occasion and, in a spirit of reconciliation, to move steadfastly towards a lasting peace in the region. is concerned, however, that We are seriously concerned by the marginalization, particularly of African countries among the least- developed countries, from the process of globalization and liberalization. In this regard, closer attention should be given to the need to address the external debt burden of the least-developed countries, especially those in Africa. Problems associated with the debt burden and its servicing still persist and frustrate the rate at which the continent can extricate itself from the vicious cycle of poverty. We therefore welcome the Mid-term Review of the Implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s and recognize the importance of the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative on Africa, as well as the need to underpin its success through appropriate and adequate resources. In this context we also welcome the designation of 1996 as the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty. We hope that the international community will General Assembly Fifty-first session realize this objective in clear recognition of the challenges facing it. We welcome the World Food Summit, which is to convene in Rome in November 1996 and which will afford the international community the opportunity to demonstrate to ensuring that poverty eradication its commitment strategies are fully integrated into all initiatives of the United Nations system. My Government is encouraged by the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (HABITAT II). The results of the Conference represent the collaborative efforts of the international community to develop a consensus view on the fundamental need to provide access to adequate shelter and infrastructure for all people. Continued support for initiatives at the national and international level to realize and implement the necessary follow-up to HABITAT II should now receive priority attention. It was an honour for South Africa to host the ninth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in April 1996. My Government believes that the sound basis for cooperation established by UNCTAD IX and the call for partnership for growth and development outlined in the Midrand Declaration must be carried forward and implemented through the General Assembly and other forums. South Africa is particularly keen to ensure that the framework which we adopted at Midrand for the reform of UNCTAD is translated into an effective facility for the developing world. to underscore also wishes South Africa the fundamental importance of international cooperation in the environmental and development fields. Sustained political commitment through global partnership remains essential for our continuing international cooperation efforts. It is for this reason that we believe that the 1997 special session of the General Assembly will provide an excellent opportunity to reaffirm the principles and objectives of the Rio Declarations Agenda 21. South Africa, a country with a long coastline, has considerable interest in matters relating to the law of the sea. We are thus pleased that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and its implementing Agreement have the International Sea-Bed Authority and related structures, of which South Africa is proud to be a member, have been established. entered into force, and that 9th plenary meeting 25 September 1996 In my statement to the General Assembly during the fiftieth session, I expressed the sincere hope that significant progress would be made in bringing about the establishment of an international criminal court. It is therefore gratifying to see that the Preparatory Committee on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court, which was established during the fiftieth session, has made much progress in bringing this idea to fruition. What is now needed is to take this process forward by holding as soon as possible a diplomatic conference where the statute of the proposed court can be finalized. It is widely acknowledged that the favourable changes in the international climate are conducive to the reform and modernization of the United Nations in order to prepare the Organization to respond effectively to the challenges of the twenty-first century. I wish to recall that in his address on 23 October the Special Commemorative Meeting of the 1995 at General Assembly, President Mandela, said: “Indeed the United Nations has to reassess its role, redefine its profile and reshape its structures. It should truly reflect the diversity of our universe and ensure equity among the nations in the exercise of power within the system of international relations in general, and the Security Council in particular.” (Official Records of the General Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings, 37th meeting, p. 6) In this regard, my delegation wishes to register its disappointment at the slow pace of advancement, with no end in sight to the deliberations of the Working Group on the question of equitable representation and increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters relating to the Security Council. In this regard we support the recommendation in the report of the Working Group that the Group should continue with its work. We would also urge Member States to demonstrate flexibility and accommodation in their future deliberations and to display the necessary political will in order to reach a common understanding. In the declaration that the Heads of State and Government adopted on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations on 24 October 1995, it was noted that “In order to carry out its work effectively, the United Nations must have adequate resources. 19 General Assembly Fifty-first session Member States must meet, in full and on time, their obligation to bear the expenses of the Organization, as apportioned the General Assembly. That apportionment should be established on the basis of criteria agreed to and considered to be fair by Member States.” (, para. 15) by My delegation has taken note of the progress of the Working Group on the financial situation in highlighting the problems facing the Organization, and urges all Member States to pay what is legally due as soon as possible in order that we may direct our energies to the real problems facing the world at this time. As we approach the twenty- first century, let us together resolve to redefine the role and shape of the United Nations and render this institution better equipped to carry out the important task of advancing peace and development in the world.
