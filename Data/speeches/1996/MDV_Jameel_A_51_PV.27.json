{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, allow me, Sir, to say how gratified we are to see you presiding over this Assembly. Your election to that high office is a well- deserved recognition of your personal qualities and experience, and also of Malaysias important role in this Organization and in the international arena. I have no doubt that you will lead the work of this Assembly to a fruitful conclusion. It is also my privilege to pay tribute to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, for the exemplary manner in which he discharged his onerous responsibilities. to the I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his untiring efforts in the cause of peace and development. While we realize the difficulties and the complexity of the challenges that lie ahead in the years to come, we remain confident in his wisdom and competence in steering this universal Organization towards the fulfilment of its responsibilities in accordance with the principles of the Charter. My delegation sincerely wishes him every success in his endeavours. Last year, we proudly celebrated 50 years of achievements. As we slowly begin the countdown to the centenary celebration of the United Nations, on behalf of the generations to come, we see ourselves coincidentally on the threshold of a new century as well. My delegation feels that this is a unique opportunity for all of us to rededicate ourselves to the purposes and principles of the Charter with greater determination and commitment to strengthening the United Nations so that the menacing trends in human relations which caused so much misery and destruction in the past can be halted and reversed, and that existing inequalities among nations and peoples can be eliminated, creating a new atmosphere of tolerance and mutual shared responsibility for development and progress. respect, and a new sense of General Assembly Fifty-first session Over the past 50 years, the Organization has grown fourfold and has become the most representative — certainly the only universal — institution serving the purpose of maintaining international peace and security. This truly global Organization has an immense capability to mobilize international efforts to deal with global problems relating to economic, social and environmental issues. It also possesses the potency to promote universal standards of human rights despite differences in the historical, cultural and religious backgrounds of nations and communities. Admittedly, the Organization has experienced rough times and has suffered several setbacks during the course of its existence. However, with the demise of the cold war that haunted the Organization for nearly four decades, a more favourable environment has emerged, enabling us to respond collectively to the challenges of the future. Mr. Seydon (Niger), Vice-President, took the Chair. is extremely important My country is among the smallest and the least developed countries of this Organization. For us, the United Nations in safeguarding our sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. For us, it is the protector of freedom and justice, particularly for the weak and the vulnerable. It is also the beacon of hope for hundreds of millions of people in the developing world for a better future free from hunger and disease. Therefore, we feel the need to steadily strengthen, revitalize and reform the Organization in order to make it more effective, more democratic, and ready to react and respond without bias to situations that threaten international peace and security. It was with this in mind that we joined in the initiative, way back in 1979, to include on the agenda an item on the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council. My delegation welcomes the reform and adjustment process that is now under way and sincerely hopes that the process will the Charter, which not compromise the principles of emphasize multilateralism, mutual respect and shared interests, including the interests of small States. In this context, my delegation feels that the proposal made by Italy in the Working Group on the reform and restructuring of the Security Council deserves our attention and careful consideration. There the more representative the United Nations is, the more democratic it will be; and that the more accountable the United Nations is, the more effective it will be, thus benefitting us all, small or large, weak or powerful, rich or poor. doubt that no is 27th plenary meeting 8 October 1996 is Reforming the Organization alone will not serve the desired purposes unless the commitment of Member States to uphold and abide by the principles of the Charter and their obligations fulfilled. We are concerned that the Organization is undergoing the worst financial crisis in its history. We are reminded that the main cause of the financial predicament is the failure of Member States to meet their financial obligations on time and in full. While my delegation has every sympathy towards those countries which have genuine difficulties, we note that by far the greater number of cases in arrears are those which have the capability to pay. We note with disappointment this Organization is among those who fail or refuse to pay their dues. It is ironic that the effects of this severe financial crisis have to be borne most adversely by the smaller and the poorer States of the Organization, which in many cases are obligated under the current scale of assessments to pay more than their fair share. In spite of its economic difficulties it faces, I am pleased to say that my country continues to pay its share of contribution in full, as we are convinced that only resources and efforts can produce results. richest Member of limited resources and the frequent that the Meanwhile my delegation believes that the efforts of the international community to reform the administrative and budgetary functioning of the United Nations should aim at utilizing the scarce resources of the Organization more efficiently. the Secretary-General to achieve a more lean and effective Secretariat geared to take on the challenging tasks entrusted to it warrant recognition. We also welcome the recent measures redundancy, duplication and waste, for only a sound organization can ensure the success of its mission. In this regard, the efforts of eliminating towards The world has never offered a greater opportunity than today to address critical developmental problems and challenges. The international community has emphasized the importance of a revitalized and enhanced system of international cooperation for development. The sheer number of major international conferences held during the past few years and the collective resolve documented offer adequate testimony to this strong desire. The outcome of these conferences fostered a common concept of sustainable economic development for the betterment of mankind as a whole. However, despite all these positive developments on the international economic and social scene, my delegation is convinced that unless these ambitious programmes are backed by the necessary resources and political will, no change can be achieved. 7 General Assembly Fifty-first session We also feel that all activities of international economic and development cooperation, including those undertaken by the Bretton Woods the World Trade Organization, must be coordinated and closely linked with the development strategies and programmes of the United Nations system. After all, this Organization remains the most representative institution. institutions and unfortunately belongs — continued While the globalization and liberalization of the world economy gave some developing countries the opportunity to assume a more prominent status in the world economy, the least-developed countries — a category to which my country be marginalized. The standard of living in least-developed countries has in effect declined over the years, and the poverty level has intensified in many of these countries due to indolent economic growth, which in turn was subject to outside factors. The overall decline in official development assistance over the years has further aggravated the conditions of the least-developed countries at a time when aid is most needed. to This unfavourable situation, if allowed to drag on, could be calamitous for countries, such as the Maldives, with severe resource constraints and fragile infrastructures. For this reason, my delegation can only appeal for priority action on various international development commitments, such as the Paris Declaration and Programme of Action for Least Developed Countries for the 1990s. These have been endorsed at various recent global conferences. Admittedly, liberalization of trade. However, liberalization has also meant the loss of the only advantage that the least-developed countries had — their privileged status — and the consequent their markets. Liberalization has therefore, in effect, contributed to the marginalization of many developing countries. resulted in greater trade has loss of The inherent obstacles facing small States, particularly small island States, and their vulnerability, deserve special attention. Small island States like my own require favoured treatment to prevent them from slipping back from their well-earned achievements. In this context, I also wish to express the need for an incisive examination of the criteria for least-developed- country status and related issues, including the graduation process, in order to do justice to the poorest among the poor countries when the criteria come up for review next year. The per capita index used to classify countries for assistance purposes is no longer adequate, particularly in the case of small States. It fails to capture the special problems faced by these countries and their vulnerability to 8 27th plenary meeting 8 October 1996 external shocks. In this context, the development and use of a vulnerability index, along with other criteria, may be feasible in order to minimize these inadequacies. On the other hand, many of the poorest countries are still entangled in a web of external debt from which they are unlikely ever to be able to free themselves. My delegation believes that more steps should be taken to lift the debt burden from the poorest and most indebted relief measures of countries by increasing the debt bilateral involvement of multilateral agencies in this responsibility. The developed countries can also help in eliminating the situation by demolishing the barriers they still maintain against imports from the less developed countries, in particular those which are suffering from the burdens of external debt. and by greater creditors Poverty cannot be eliminated through charity, but only through cooperation. In this context, we welcome the the Organization for proposal of Economic Cooperation and Development the number of people living in absolute poverty by half in the next two decades. the countries of to cut to safeguard the community We are fully committed to the efforts of the international global environment, especially by building the capacity of the United Nations to promote sustainable development for all. We welcome the work carried out by the Commission on Sustainable Development in this regard, and are looking forward to the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Environment and Development review conference in 1997. My delegation is confident that this review process will give the international community the opportunity to rededicate itself once again to the preservation of the global environment. Only concerted efforts on all fronts can produce encouraging results in this the environment is an important issue. We are conscious of the fragility of our islands and we hope to be able to them from the potential dangers arising from protect global warming and sea-level rise. We are also determined to keep our country environment-friendly, clean and unpolluted. Though the land area we have is so limited, I am happy to mention that in the Maldives we initiated a programme in January this year for planting one million trees in three years; I presume that if all countries similar programmes at a rate of four trees per capita, the world would be greener and cleaner in 10 years. challenge. For the Maldives, here would represented daunting initiate General Assembly Fifty-first session and the concluded, agreements The importance of disarmament for the preservation and maintenance of world peace and security cannot be overemphasized. We believe that, with the treaties and bilateral ongoing negotiations among the nuclear-weapon States, and also with the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons last year, the international community is now reaffirming its commitment to global disarmament and renewing the hopes for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. My delegation is pleased about the positive approaches taken by the nuclear-weapon States towards the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, despite the lack of consensus. We are particularly happy that the Treaty has now been opened for signature. We also would like to praise the role played by the United Nations in demining and mine clearance, and to congratulate those involved in this dangerous activity for their bravery and dedication. Anti-personnel landmines have caused enormous human suffering and continue to maim and incapacitate countless innocent men, women and children. We look forward to a worldwide ban on this horrible and inhuman instrument of killing. My delegation is firmly committed to the concept of the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace and would like to take this opportunity to call upon all regions, especially the countries in the region of South Asia, to which we belong, to make every effort to bring about the proposed nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia without any further delay. Internal strife generated and fanned by ethnic, religious and other factors is a recent trend, which is causing large conflagrations in some parts of the world. While our Organization gropes for effective mechanisms to respond to such exigencies, we should not ignore the serious threats posed by drug traffickers, terrorists and mercenaries, particularly to small States. Terrorist incidents have increased alarmingly over the last few years. My delegation is the international community should intensify its efforts to combat terrorism. The early entry into force of the Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries will be a step forward in addressing these threats. We urge all States which have not yet done so to ratify the Convention as early as possible. Similarly, my delegation would like to call for the strongest possible international action against drug traffickers, who are not only poisoning the fabric of human life but also draining the potential for fully convinced that 27th plenary meeting 8 October 1996 productivity and prosperity of nations by exploiting the vulnerable elements in our societies. Though deeply concerned over the recent violence in Palestine and in the occupied lands, which resulted in the death or injury of hundreds of men, women and children, my delegation is happy to observe that despite the numerous difficulties that exist, the Middle East peace process is continuing to move forward. We fervently hope that the agreements reached so far will be implemented fully and without further delay. The important and critical role played by the proponents of the peace process, especially the United States, deserves the appreciation and praise of the international community and should not be forgotten. My delegation is convinced that their positive role will continue to be instrumental to the success of the peace process. At the same time, we also feel that the United Nations should continue to play its important role in providing means to the Palestinian people in their just struggle for the restoration of their inalienable rights, including the right to self-determination and to the establishment of a sovereign State which could coexist with its neighbours in peace and harmony. The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is encouraging, but we need to remain alert. The Dayton Agreement has finally paved the way to creating a lasting peace in Bosnia. The fulfilment of the commitments of the international community is, however, critical to the achievement and consolidation of full peace. We also believe that it is important and necessary to bring those responsible for the atrocities and the crimes of genocide to justice and to punish them. My delegation remains convinced that the United Nations is the most viable and dependable universal institution today. It is the responsibility of all of us to allow this universal Organization to play a more central and active role in shaping and harnessing international cooperation for economic growth and development. It is also our conviction that the dedication and collective endeavours of the international community, which have enabled the United Nations to survive the past 50 years, will to greater heights of unity and cooperation so as to preserve and maintain the principles of the Charter, promote its objectives, and strengthen the Organization, to better serve and enhance the well-being of the peoples of the world. thereby enabling it inspire us all 9 General Assembly Fifty-first session President The Acting from French): I now call on the Minister for Legal Affairs and Local Government of Grenada, His Excellency Mr. Raphael Fletcher. (interpretation it is a widely acknowledged truth that Mr. Fletcher (Grenada): Virtue constitutes the greatest form of human strength. Indeed, the very origin of the word “virtue” connotes manly strength — not merely physical strength, but moral strength. With respect to human interaction, the greatest form of power arises when virtue is furnished with means. That is the concept that gave birth to the United Nations, inspired its noble deeds, and generally continues to inform its operations. Accordingly, our celebration last year of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations was quintessentially a collective expression of rejoicing in the wisdom embodied in that powerful truth, as well as an explicit, joint recommitment on the part of Member nations to act in accordance with the principle of empowerment of virtue, through the supply of appropriate means. In this context it is, for me, a great honour to be afforded the opportunity to address this very distinguished gathering of the fifty-first session of the General Assembly. This event in the world calendar, as far as political deliberations are concerned. is easily the most important My delegation conveys to this Assembly the greetings of the Government and the people of Grenada, and congratulates His Excellency Mr. Razali Ismail of Malaysia on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session. We were particularly impressed with the way in which Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal conducted the affairs of the General Assembly at its fiftieth session, and take this opportunity to thank him for his handling of those proceedings. to the My delegation further expresses appreciation and thanks Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his vision and willingness to confront the many challenges that the Organization has recently been facing and, specifically for his dedication in seeking to solve world problems in the socio-economic and political spheres. This new session of the General Assembly is being the background of a continually changing held against global environment. That notwithstanding, there exists, on the one hand, a spirit of international cooperation and, on the other, a high degree of convergence of several ideals, such as the institution and strengthening of democracy, promoting and fostering economic integration and political 10 27th plenary meeting 8 October 1996 harmony, and the pursuit and practice of a new multilateralism. Yet it must be expressly stated that the noble goal of achieving global democracy, peace and prosperity can be realized only with significant inputs from the developed countries acting in collaboration with the disadvantaged ones. Currently, many of the small developing countries that are Members of this Organization are faced with severe economic problems. It cannot be overemphasized that measures aimed at stabilizing their economies and creating the sustained growth and development have very painful effects on the populace. Nonetheless, these effects can be made more bearable, and it behoves us to point specifically to the human dimension in this regard. conditions for Since June 1995, the new Administration in Grenada has focused on strengthening our democratic institutions and on rebuilding our economy. My Government has been developing strategies, mechanisms and procedures to increase transparency and accountability in the conduct of Government. Moreover, my Government has pledged itself to respect the fundamental rights of all citizens as well as to other elements of civil society, such as a free press, freedom of expression, a fair and open democratic process, the supremacy under God of our Constitution and the effective functioning of the parliamentary system, for which our Constitution specifically and explicitly provides. Economically, our domestic policies are aimed primarily at encouraging individuals and businesses to maximize the return on their enterprise and efforts. We have embraced the notion that promoting micro- enterprises is one of the ways to accomplish this goal. Only recently, we initiated a micro-enterprise programme, with the provision of a modest sum to help young entrepreneurs in particular to embark upon their several ventures. We hope that the programme will succeed, thereby contributing to our overall economic development, both materially and psycho-culturally. Such preferential treatment is being given to the young so as to better fashion a culture of confidence, thoughtful creativity and purposeful enterprise. We are actively seeking also to enhance opportunities to enable our working population to attain higher standards of living. My Government has specific goals including balanced and integrated sectoral growth, a relevant and adaptive education system, health for all, and strategic human resource planning and development. In itself set General Assembly Fifty-first session latter respect, priority is being placed on the this development of an adequately skilled and disciplined work force. While we are aware that the matter of economic and individual personal development is first and foremost a national responsibility, we are deeply conscious that our limited domestic resources constitute a severe constraint upon us in our quest to fulfil this obligation. Accordingly, we earnestly ask — indeed we urge — the many United Nations agencies involved in such activities, and also individual Governments, to continue to provide to us and to others in the same position the kind of help that is needed to meet satisfactorily growing demand for to our national development. the spectrum of expertise vital The grim realities of the very limited resources of very small countries are well known. Nonetheless, these realities have become more glaring in this era of trade liberalization and the globalization of production. Both of these phenomena, as conceived and elaborated by the developed countries, are startling reminders to us not only of our condition of institutionalized non-reciprocating dependence in a world that is becoming increasingly interdependent, but also of our vulnerability to economic marginalization. Thus, we are in no way, and to no degree, inhibited with regard to addressing inviting profound reflection on the issue of the special circumstances of small island developing States — particularly those in the Caribbean region, where prominent among the features characterizing our special circumstances is the ever-present vulnerability to natural disaster and the widespread devastation resulting therefrom. The need for official development assistance and the transfer of real resources from the North to the South has never been as pronounced as it is now. Indeed, such are the dimensions of that need in terms of both spread and intensity that the transfer of resources referred to here can be effected only on the basis of a concept of a new global order as was initially envisaged and expressed in principle by the President of Guyana, His Excellency Dr. Cheddi Jagan, and adopted by all the member States of the Caribbean Community. This, no doubt, has to be elaborated, and the countries of the North are especially requested to give disciplined and objective consideration to this matter. The conceptual requirements of a reconstructive change in interaction between North and the new global order include: 27th plenary meeting 8 October 1996 South; a new basis for interaction; a new ethic for relating one to the other; and a genuine partnership, a partnership which eschews exploitation of any one people by another and seeks instead to pursue mutual upliftment of the peoples involved. More specifically, it is explicitly posited here that the developed countries should assist the less developed countries in respect of the following: first, the alleviation of the debt burden by one means or another; secondly, assistance for the development of centres for investment, the training of human resources, and training in how to make the economy more efficient, responsive and transparent; and thirdly, technical assistance to the smaller economies to help them make the transition towards incorporation and effective participation in a global economy that is so markedly characterized by so-called free trade. Smaller countries must not be excluded from processes which they cannot direct in their favour or, indeed, effectively influence so as to avoid experiencing the deleterious effects of those processes. Those are but a few of the tenets upon which the proffered concept of the new global order is based. and particularly the It is common knowledge that bananas provide a livelihood for a significant percentage of the people of the the Caribbean, subregion of Organization of Eastern Caribbean States. Thus, the current challenge to our special arrangements for that fruit in Europe is, to say the least, uncaring, if not hostile. Grenada and several of the other States now being so affected have, on many issues, collaborated with and supported those very countries that are now quite unrelenting upon our preferential arrangement, which constitutes an assault on the well-being and the very livelihood of a significant proportion of our people. in their deliberate assault There should be no need whatsoever to remind the Assembly that there is a direct correlation between the premature destruction of our banana industry and the well-being and integrity of our democratic process and thus of our democracy itself. Substantial increases in crime and other social ills have been shown to induce commensurate increases in involvement in trading in, and the use of, illicit drugs. We certainly prefer to prevent the occurrence of such situations than to have to expend our energies and scarce resources on remedial action to contain and eradicate the now ever-present threat of an expanding narco-culture. 11 General Assembly Fifty-first session It cannot be denied that, there are other, and more important, objectives to be achieved besides protecting the market economy. And this applies to all countries, the developed as well as the less developed. The time is now right for serious thrusts to be made towards the alleviation of the poverty and deprivation which are so widespread across the world, although most prevalent in the developing countries. This process must be activated immediately to ensure that economic progress is buttressed by social equity. Freedom from want; good health; genuine education; a clean environment; elimination of the scourge of illicit drugs, as well as of unemployment and underemployment; and the better and wider enjoyment of basic human rights: these are the goals we should unswervingly and constantly be seeking to reach. In this context, my Government is cognizant of its duties and responsibilities. We are convinced that through prudent management of our very limited resources, a willingness on the part of our people to work hard and, on our part, clear political leadership and virtuously inspired guidance — all enhanced by the support of friendly Governments and donor agencies — we shall, in due course, place our country on a sound path towards genuine growth. My delegation is happy to state in this regard that some improvement has already been made and that our Government looks forward to achieving in the not too distant future most of the goals we have set ourselves in order more effectively to pursue those other goals, which would significantly enhance the quality of our peoples lives. In the context of collective international efforts towards the achievement of some kind of sustainable development in the less developed countries, it is instructive to refer to the recently held Group of Seven summit in Lyon, France, where most of the efforts focused on the new global order. The leaders of the worlds most powerful nations agreed that in the present global economic situation it is absolutely necessary to control negative consequences and fight against the risks of exclusion, both at the national and international entitled “Globalization for the Benefit of All”, does seem to signal the stirrings of a new order for humankind. communique, levels. Their Grenada welcomes the discussion held on aid for from the development — particularly with officials International Monetary Fund and the World Bank — and is 12 27th plenary meeting 8 October 1996 heartened by the fact that in those discussions modalities were defined for a new partnership for development based on the sharing of responsibilities between developed countries, and multilateral organizations. developing countries The pledge by the G-7 countries to ensure substantial flows of public aid for development to the countries most in need is very timely and most welcome. Dare we of the South perceive this pronouncement by the G-7 to be not simply a pledge of honour but, further, an expression of subscription to the new global order, as enunciated by a visionary of the South, underscored now by a soulful shinning forth of virtue on the part of the North? My delegation sincerely hopes so. It is several years since any substantial change was made to the structure of one of the most important organs of this Organization. I refer to the Security Council. Meanwhile, the international political and economic environments have undergone some drastic and far- reaching transformations. Grenada strongly believes that in order to reflect the new geopolitical and economic realities of our world today, there are changes that are now due, the Security Council. Accordingly, my delegation expresses its unwavering support for the reforms currently being undertaken, as well as those now being contemplated with respect to the United Nations system. particularly in In July of this year, the European Union, through its Parliament, adopted a resolution to support the call for participation in international organizations by the Republic of China. The Government and people of Grenada consider this action on the part of the European Union to have been a most significant development. We welcome this development, and we applaud the European Union for it. Indeed, we are encouraged by that action, for the persistent plea of Grenada, constantly repeated over several years in every appropriate forum, has now been amplified into a clarion call for moral justice, in contrast to the expediency of power politics, economic advantage and legislative manipulation of yesteryear. The Republic of China has for many years consistently displayed its commitment to the values and principles of this body. Indeed, in the face of threats and undisguised acts of aggression, the courageous people of the Republic of China boldly chose to embark upon a path of freedom, justice, and respect for human rights, and recently took part in their presidential election, which was open, free and fair. General Assembly Fifty-first session The economic achievements of this brave country of 21.3 million people are well and widely known. Thus, there can be no doubt as to the capability of the people of the Republic of China to make substantial contributions to the work of the United Nations. As to their willingness to make significant contributions, that also cannot be a matter of doubt. They have given testimony in this regard in several ways. They have established their good faith. They deserve the right to participate in the conferences and activities of the United Nations system. To continue to deny them this right would be to persist in denying them justice within the confraternity of nations. Superior power is found only where there is superior excellence of some kind, and the Republic of China has manifested a certain degree of superior power which derives from virtue rather than from physical strength. Thus, the Government and people of Grenada unequivocally exhort this Assembly to secure participation by the Republic of China in the agencies and activities of the United nations system. With every passing year, contemporary politics becomes more complex and, thus, commensurately complex are the related solutions. In this regard, my delegation especially applauds the efforts of the United Nations in attempting to maintain some degree of peace and security in various parts of the world. From Haiti to the war-torn Republics of the former Yugoslavia, to the famine-stricken cities of many an African State, the United Nations humanitarian activities and missions of peace are indeed worthy of special commendation. In this regard, I seize the opportunity now afforded me to express a fathers appreciation of and blessings upon my son Mark, who for some years has been and continues to be so engaged, and I ask your indulgence in this regard. Grenada is encouraged by the progress — albeit halting — made in the Middle East peace process and urges continued dialogue until the noble ideal of peaceful coexistence is achieved. But world peace and security will not be attained if those countries with nuclear capabilities continue to promulgate their use for military purposes. My delegation therefore welcomes efforts to institute a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. 27th plenary meeting 8 October 1996 the transactions. In the name of humanity, Government and the people of Grenada, without equivocation and without qualification, call this practice to be stopped, and stopped now. therefore, for It has been suggested by Max Ascoli that “civilization is a constant quest for non-violent means of solving conflicts — a common quest for peace.” Nonetheless, my Government perceives civilization as being more than simply a quest for peace, more than merely the shunning of visible violence. My Government sees civilization as the purposeful pursuit of peace through commitment to justice; the inherent equality of all men and women; and the inalienable rights which derive from simply being human. My Government subscribes to the principle of the overriding rule of moral law. In the context of violations of humanness, it behoves me to express, on behalf of my delegation, the deep concern of the Government and the people of Grenada in respect of the agonies which are currently being experienced by a significant number of persons in Cyprus. Grenada, like Cyprus, is an island nation, small, but sovereign. We therefore call for an end to the suffering to which so many of the families and individual persons of that beautiful country have been subjected. The smallness of a nation does not, to any degree whatever, negate the fundamental human rights of each of its citizens. The great Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran, in his Thoughts and Meditations, offered humanity the following insightful observation: “My soul preached to me and showed me that I am neither more than the pygmy, nor less than the giant. Ere my soul preached to me, I looked upon humanity as two men; one weak, whom I pitied, and the other strong, whom I followed or resisted in defiance. But now I have learned that I am as both are, and made from the same elements. My origin is their origin, my conscience is their conscience, my contention is their contention, and my pilgrimage is their pilgrimage.” Similarly, the practice of transporting hazardous radioactive materials, particularly through the Caribbean Sea, must very surreptitiousness with which this business is conducted and transportation effected is indeed a tacit admission of wrongdoing. Caribbean humanness is violated in such immediately. stopped The be is of My deeply delegation the unsurpassable wisdom which these words of Khalil Gibran represent. The sentiment conveyed constitutes the sine qua non for international brotherhood. This we do believe. the realization of convinced 13 General Assembly Fifty-first session Accordingly, my delegation earnestly urges that henceforth the quintessential sameness of all mankind and a genuine commitment to virtue should be adopted as the guiding principles of this Assembly. May God bless everyone participating in this fifty-first regular session of the Assembly, so that, so much the more effectively, the Assembly will be a transforming blessing to our world. "}}
