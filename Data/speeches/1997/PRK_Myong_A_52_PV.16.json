{"speech":{"0":" We have been surprised by the fact that the gentleman from South Korea this morning attempted to infuse antagonism and confrontation with distorted allegations against us at the time when prominent personalities of the world are engaging in constructive deliberations on the enhancement of the United Nations role in of reconciliation and cooperation. We strongly reject his allegations, which are characterized by falseness and political illiteracy aimed at misleading world opinion. twenty-first atmosphere the century in an As for chemical weapons, it was none other than the United States and South Korea that introduced and used chemical weapons in the Korean peninsula. Therefore, the South Korean authorities have no right whatsoever to talk about the Chemical Weapons Convention. My country was a direct victim of biochemical-weapon attacks by the United States and South Korea during the Korean War in the 1950s. The fact that South Korea, which is the offender, is slandering my country while maintaining a huge storage of chemical weapons is nothing but a deceptive plot to keep behind a screen its preparations for new biochemical- weapons warfare. It remains exclusively the sovereign right of each State whether or not to accede to the Convention on the ban of chemical weapons. South Koreas imitation of exactly what was said by the United States — which is the suzerain State of South Korea — in regard to anti-personnel landmines is arousing great disappointment on the part of the international community. As for the issue of human rights, South Korea is actually a human rights desert on the Korean peninsula which causes grave concern to the international community. The present social system in South Korea inevitably leads to a systematic and consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights. This is because the national security law, which completely denies all rights and freedoms — including the right to chose ideology and freedom of expression and opinion, which are stipulated in international human rights instruments — has been in existence as a legal apparatus to prop up such a social system for the past half century. The national security law has so far produced a large number of prisoners of conscience, including long-term political prisoners, and is still being used as a panacea to 16th plenary meeting 29 September 1997 suppress the non-violent political activities of dissidents and organizations, including “Manchongryon”, the South Korean student organization. According to initial statistics there are hundreds of prisoners of conscience, including long-term political prisoners such as Messrs. An Hak Sop and Han Jang Ho and many others who have been imprisoned for more than 40 years, twice as long as the term served by President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, who was once known in the world as the longest-serving prisoner. They have been languishing in prison cells 0.7 square metres in size, without seeing a single ray of the sun from the age of 20 years up to 60 or 70 years. Only after their deaths can they be released. Whether thousands or tens of thousands more such prisoners of conscience are yet to be known remains the only secret of the South Korean authorities. As long as such anti-human rights laws as the national security law linger like a nightmare, the situation of human rights violations in South Korea will remain unchanged. The international community has already stigmatized the national security law as a root cause of the human rights violations and called for its abolition accordingly. Even the United States, suzerain State of South Korea, could no longer protect South Korea and made it clear that the abolition of the national security law was its official position. It is imperative that the South Korean authorities keep in mind that regime cannot automatically become a civilian regime simply by being decorated with a civilian wrapper. their We take this opportunity to recommend to South Korea that it discontinue becoming the object of international denunciation by abolishing the national security law, democratizing its society and unconditionally releasing all prisoners of conscience. We have much more to say to South Korea with regard to the four-party talks. The United States and South Korean sides explained that the proposed four-party talks are intended to ensure durable peace on the Korean peninsula. In order to achieve this peace, the present armistice system should be replaced without delay with a durable peace agreement and the United States troops stationed in South Korea should be withdrawn. This is the common sense which is crystal clear to everyone. However, during the previous two rounds of preliminary talks, the South Korean side strongly opposed 29 General Assembly Fifty-second session these issues, contrary to the the deliberations of aforementioned purposes of the talks. Instead it insisted that the four-party talks should focus mainly on the issue concerning the relations between the North and the South of Korea. The Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea maintains its stance that it is undesirable to discuss the issue of North-South relations at talks because this is an internal issue of the nation. Therefore, the claim on the part of the South Korean side for the deliberation of the internal views of the nation at the multilateral talks is an expression devoid of any national independence and an anti-national act to induce foreign interferences. the multilateral South Korea cosmeticized itself as if it were an angel in providing humanitarian assistance. This is nothing but sheer hypocrisy. To be frank with you, Sir, South Korea is clamouring ostensibly about the humanitarian assistance to my country, and after turning its back it is resorting to sinister attempts to lay obstacles to the provision of humanitarian and international governmental organizations by saying that the assistance was diverted in full for the use of the military and that there would be good farming this year. assistance and non-governmental countries other by In 1984, when South Korea was afflicted by floods the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea generously provided a large quantity of cooperation in a noble humanitarian and compatriotic spirit. As long as South Korea attempts to use the issue of humanitarian cooperation for its unjust political purpose, we have no intention of receiving any cooperation as such. We urge the South Korean authorities to immediately discontinue abusing the issue of humanitarian cooperation to pursue their political purposes to stifle and isolate our Republic. As for the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, the South Korean authorities — who have introduced foreign nuclear weapons into the country to destroy our nation — have not any qualification whatsoever to comment on it. To repeat, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is a bilateral one to be settled only between the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea and the United States. The South Korean authorities should just sit down and enjoy watching the process rather than behaving ridiculously on the nuclear issue. We sincerely wish the South Korean authorities would behave with a spirit of national independence, cease to depend upon foreign forces at the earliest possible date, and discontinue abusing the sacred forum of the United Nations for North-South confrontation. 30 16th plenary meeting 29 September 1997 Mr. Gorelik (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): Speaking at this mornings plenary meeting, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Moldova, Mr. Nicolae Tabakaru, stated that there continued to be an illegitimate deployment of contingents of the Russian Federation on the territory of his country, and that this contradicted the principle of international law that foreign troops could not be deployed on the territory of a State without In this connection, our delegation is authorized to respond as follows. its agreement. That statement is in contradiction with the agreement of the Presidents of Russia and Moldova which was reached during recent meetings in September in Moscow, whose essence is that the number of Russian troops in Transdniester are constantly being reduced. However, the final withdrawal of these troops without a political settlement of the problem of Transdniester could lead to uncontrolled development of the situation, especially since there are major arsenals in that region. As is well known, the Russian Federation is taking an active part in promoting the earliest possible settlement in Transdniester. This role of our country was noted by the head of the Moldovan delegation in his statement today. It is our view that the problem should be settled on the basis of defining a special status for the Transdniester region while preserving the territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova. This principle was in fact reflected in the memorandum signed on 8 May this year in Moscow on the principles of normalizing relations between the Republic of Moldova and Transdniester. The process of restoring normal life and dialogue between the parties is not developing as simply as one would wish. A great deal of painstaking work is continuing, with the involvement of the Russian side, which and emotional features. These can be overcome only by means of determined and peaceful efforts. complications encountering certain is In the framework of the close bilateral relations between Kishinev and Moscow, the President and the Government of the Republic of Moldova show a clear understanding of this reality. However, in his statement the head of the delegation of the Republic of Moldova gave a different interpretation to the situation. This raises some questions, bearing in mind the fact that only a few the Russian days ago the deputy Chairman of General Assembly Fifty-second session Government, Mr. Serov, visited Moldova and talked with the leadership of the Republic of Moldova and the leaders of Transdniester. During those negotiations, the Russian side did not hear anything similar to what we heard today from this rostrum. In conclusion, I would like to say that we are convinced that the process of a settlement in Transdniester is possible, but to retain its constructive dynamics. From the Russian side, everything is being done so that this process can prevail. is important for this it Mr. Lim (Republic of Korea): It is regrettable, though not entirely surprising, that our North Korean colleague has presented another typically unproductive statement against the Republic of Korea. Although he referred to several issues, I wish to speak mainly about the human rights question for the sake of his own enlightenment and for the information of other delegations, as my Foreign Minister explained in full detail our position on the other issues this morning. First and foremost, I would like to ask my North Korean colleague if he truly believes North Korea is in any position to call into question human rights anywhere in the world. The concept of human rights is complex and multidimensional, and therefore any debate on this issue tends to be contentious and inconclusive. On the other hand, however, discussing North Koreas human rights situation is simple. Politically, it is a well known fact that North Korea has been sustained by a totalitarian system which has now taken the shape of the worlds first communist dynasty. Is this a system which encourages, or even allows, political participation by its citizens? I seriously doubt it. Economically, I am equally sceptical that the basic human needs of ordinary North Koreans are being met by their leadership — a leadership which claims it has created a workers paradise.I wonder how it reconciles this concept of paradise with North Koreas current economic situation? Socially, North Koreans in the grip of unimaginable the fundamental freedoms of movement, speech and assembly are totally alien to the people of North Korea. subjugation. Indeed, control live and On the international front, North Korea has shown how woefully out of step it is with the rest of the world by announcing its intention to withdraw from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in response to a 16th plenary meeting 29 September 1997 adopted resolution concerning the human rights situation in North Korea the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities. session years this at of If anything remains unclear about the human rights situation in North Korea it is always possible to refer to Amnesty Internationals reports, which contain vivid information about, among other things, the large-scale concentration camps for political prisoners throughout North Korea. All in all, I believe that the description of North Korea in a survey of The Freedom House as “the worst among the most repressive States” provides a quick summary of the human rights situation in North Korea. The North Korean representative also spoke at length about our national security law. What he failed to mention, however, was why that law was enacted. To put it bluntly, we needed such a law because North Korea continues to dispatch armed agents to the Republic of Korea, as evidenced by the North Korean submarine infiltration incident last September. In fact, North Koreas Communist Party Charter still stipulates the reunification of the two sides of Korea under communist rule as a primary objective. Against that backdrop, my delegation considers it nothing short of preposterous for the North Korean delegation to question the human rights situation of another State. If North Korea still insists on discussing human rights it should first of all open its own hermetically sealed society to the world, especially to human rights organizations, so that we can all see exactly what is going on inside its borders. In the absence of any objective information or corroborative evidence to the contrary, North Koreas baseless assertions will continue to ring as hollow as before. Mr. Choe Myong Nam (Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea): I do not feel there is any need to refute categorically the intervention of the South Korean representative, which was again characterized by political illiteracy and went against human nature. 31 General Assembly Fifty-second session As all delegations have just witnessed, the South Korean authorities are still inciting confrontation between the north and the south of Korea, even at this sacred forum of the United Nations. For the sake of increasing the understanding of the distinguished representatives, let me briefly refer to one stark reality. In recent years, the Governments of various countries, international organizations and other relevant organizations — irrespective of their differences in social systems, political views and religious beliefs — have been providing generous humanitarian assistance to my country, which has been suffering from a series of natural disasters. We are very grateful to all of these Governments and organizations for their sincere assistance. However, the South Korean authorities are attempting to destroy the international atmosphere for humanitarian assistance by bringing into the United States people who committed crimes in my country and defected to South Korea some years ago out of fear of prosecution. And the South Korean authorities have organized a press conference to take place during the current General Assembly session. They are even saying that this humanitarian assistance should not be provided to the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, and that the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea has stocks of extra food. Under such circumstances how can we communicate with the South Korean authorities, who are devoid of humanity, rather than sharing our nationality? These attempts are anti-national and anti-ethical and certainly deserve condemnation from the international community. This shows the reality of North and South Korean relations, which the South Korean authorities often clamour about. Mr. Lim (Republic of Korea): I am once again rather disappointed that the North Korean delegation has either failed to understand, or pretended to ignore, how they are actually perceived by the international community. This time, however, our response will be short, as we dont wish to involve other delegations in a discussion the outcome of which may be easily predicted by everyone in this Hall — except, probably, one delegation. Just for reference, I would just like to inform other delegations in this Hall that as the single largest donor, the Republic of Korea has provided North Korea with $280 million of food and financial aid since 1995. 32 16th plenary meeting 29 September 1997 "}}
