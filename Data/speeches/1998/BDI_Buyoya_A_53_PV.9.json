{"speech":{"0":" The fifty-third session of the General Assembly provides us once again with an opportunity to look at the overall situation in the world and to reflect together on the future of the peoples and the nations that we represent. But first of all, may I extend to Mr. Didier Opertti our warm and sincere congratulations on his well-deserved election, which is but recognition of his intellectual and personal qualities and which, I am certain, will ensure the success of the work of this session. We would like also to pay a warm tribute to his predecessor, who presided so brilliantly over the work of the previous session. My delegation is pleased to express appreciation for the courageous and ongoing work being carried out by Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, in support of peace in the world and particularly on the African continent. When on 25 July 1996 we had to carry out a very radical change of government in Burundi, the political situation was an explosive one. Every day Burundians were dying without really knowing why, and the threat of genocide and widespread chaos was a very real danger. I shall not go into the details of that situation, as the Security Council, his representative in Bujumbura have followed on a daily basis the evolution of the crisis which has in recent years disrupted my country. the Secretary-General and Since that change on 25 July 1996, we have stated clearly that restoration of security and the beginning of a peace process are our basic concerns. This fifty-third session provides me with an opportunity to tell you about the efforts made by the people of Burundi, its leaders and the international community to attain our goals of restoring a lasting peace in the country. Despite some acts of terrorism, I can say to this Assembly that security has now been fully restored in Burundi. The threat of genocide so feared by its people is gone today. Two years ago the peace process was initiated; it is now under way and proceeding in a manner satisfactory to all those concerned. I should like to focus my statement today on this peace project.

General Assembly Fifty-third session The idea of a peace-process project in Burundi is based on the realization that despite the ethnic turn taken by violence which brought such tragedy to my country over the last five years, the underlying cause of the Burundi crisis is essentially a political one. That is why we are focusing our efforts on seeking a political solution to the crisis. the internal Two years ago we set in motion a peace process which was divided into two aspects: the internal aspect and the external aspect. At the dynamic provided by the peace process led to a domestic agreement on political partnership. Two years ago, the Government which emerged from the change of 25 July 1996 and the National Assembly elected in 1993 began a dialogue geared towards a political rapprochement. This initiative led to an agreement on political partnership. level, Today, we have a provisional constitution which came out of that partnership and which governs the institutions of our Republic, primarily the Government and the National Assembly. In Burundi, the political partnership is a reality not only between Government and the National Assembly but also with the majority of the registered political parties and the representatives of civil society who have joined the partnership for peace. It is within this framework that a negotiated Government, bringing together the main political forces in the country, is now in place and has been functioning for three months. The National Assembly elected include representatives of other registered political parties and representatives of civil society. expanded 1993 in has been to I can say to this Assembly — and those who have visited Burundi recently have been able to note this themselves — that this partnership has transformed, and continues to transform, the political landscape in Burundi in a positive way. Today, the political class within our country is organizing a wide-ranging discussion on the partnership to enable the people of Burundi to absorb the idea of peace, the ultimate objective being stabilization of the country through the restoration of peace. for its part, The Government, is preparing its programme based on the political agreement which emerged from the partnership. The major issues, such as democracy, justice, security and development, are in the forefront of this programme which the Government will be submitting to the parliament at its next session in October. My Government is determined to continue consolidating the partnership within the country. We deeply believe that this approach can establish the bases for an overall agreement 2 9th plenary meeting 22 September 1998 associating our compatriots living abroad with our peace project. It was the existence of this political partnership at the domestic level which made possible the beginning of a process of global negotiations involving Burundians abroad in the peace process. The negotiations, bringing together people of Burundi living at home and abroad, began on 15 June 1998 in Arusha, in the United Republic of Tanzania. The second negotiating session took place on 20 July, and the third meeting is scheduled for 12 October. These negotiations are proceeding in a manner satisfactory to all the participants: the Burundians, the facilitator and the representatives of the international community. I should like to declare that the Government of Burundi is resolved to do its utmost to assure the success of these negotiations. We divided the peace process into two aspects, domestic and external, because it is simply a question of methodology. The peace process is one and indivisible. First of all, we wanted to get the people of Burundi involved in the peace process before the Arusha negotiations, so that we could take into consideration the recent experience of our subregion. Peace negotiations which do not involve the people often take a tragic turn. sanctions I should like to declare from this rostrum that the peace process is now under way to the satisfaction of the people of Burundi. We are determined to resolve through dialogue the dispute pitting Burundians one against the other. Unfortunately, there are obstacles along our path towards lasting peace, the main one being the economic sanctions imposed on Burundi on 31 July 1996. These economic the most vulnerable sectors of our society. They are destroying the economic and social fabric of the country and over the long term are jeopardizing stabilization over the long term in our country. In fact, the impact of the embargo on the people of Burundi is devastating. Let me give you a few figures: grade school attendance has dropped from 70 to 43 per cent; the vaccination rate has plummeted from 80 to 40 per cent and malnutrition among children under the age of 5 is now 43 per cent. in particular affect Moreover, the embargo imposed on Burundi is now enriching a few individuals in the country in a scandalous manner and is tragically impoverishing millions of people there. This embargo is eroding trust between the mediators and the parties to the conflict, particularly the Government of Burundi. Even though all the conditions imposed by those who initiated the embargo have now the economic sanctions are still being been met, General Assembly Fifty-third session maintained. Today there is absolutely no justification, moral or political, for continuing the embargo against Burundi. I would appeal to the countries of our subregion and to the mediator organizing the negotiations in Arusha to lift the embargo before it definitively torpedoes our peace project. Our appeal is also directed to the international community for support in our effort at peace-building in Burundi. We must act now to concert our peace efforts. Tomorrow will be too late. Those who have sinned by omission will bear an important responsibility. The other significant obstacle to peace in Burundi is the continuing violence perpetrated by armed factions based in the territories of certain neighbouring countries. I call on those countries to assume their share of the responsibility. One cannot both call for negotiations and tolerate terrorist actions by armed groups without jeopardizing the entire peace process. For negotiations to begin, there must be a cessation of hostilities. Burundi, a landlocked country under economic sanctions, needs international solidarity. Humanitarian assistance must be stepped up in order to help those afflicted by this crisis. We would wish to see international cooperation with our country resumed without further delay. Security conditions are no worse in Burundi than in the other countries of the Great Lakes region. Burundians simply ask to be treated fairly. Our commitment and resolve to achieve peace in Burundi through dialogue must no longer be called into question. The facts today speak for themselves. We are negotiating with all Burundians who have political demands. My countrys domestic concerns will not allow me to forget the other problems afflicting Africa and the world. Far from it. throughout At this time of globalization, a sustained effort must be made by the international community to promote balanced development the world. Africa deserves special attention. If one advocates development then one must also increase official through trade, development the growth of economies that remain fragile. Africa is being crushed by the weight of its debt. The burden must be eased and eliminated for the poorest countries. Globalization without solidarity with the poorest nations will not lead to a peaceful world. to stimulate assistance 9th plenary meeting 22 September 1998 In order to adapt to inevitable changes, the developing countries must organize themselves. Here, I envision the creation of regional areas of integration that will make our economies viable. We are in favour of regional integration, but one that respects the identity and sovereignty of each country. We are opposed to regional integration that includes the domination and hegemony of the most powerful. Regional economic integration can be achieved, however, only in secure regions. Our region of the Great Lakes remains subject to extreme instability. This cyclical insecurity has endured for decades and has unleashed floods of refugees. Entire defeated armies move through the an unprecedented genocide. region, which experienced already has We continue to follow very carefully the evolution of the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I wish to reaffirm that our country, Burundi, is in no way involved in that conflict. However, we remain concerned, on the one hand, by a certain tenor of statement that pits peoples against peoples on the basis of ethnic identity; and, on the other, by militias and certain rebels, whom we in the region remember only too well. I would urge all participants in this conflict not to allow themselves to be entrapped and led down that road, because it leads only to danger that could engulf the entire region in flames. Burundi will continue to ensure that its security is not destabilized. To that end, we shall take all appropriate measures. We continue to advocate peaceful means and dialogue to resolve this conflict. If the Government of Burundi is asked to contribute to a political solution, it will be very happy to do so. In Burundi, we believe that the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations should coordinate their efforts more effectively in seeking a solution to the crisis the Congo, particularly when we limitations of subregional organizations. in the Democratic Republic of consider the At the global level, every region of our planet faces varying degrees of environmental degradation, terrorism, endemic disease, drug abuse and hunger, to mention only the most widespread threats.
