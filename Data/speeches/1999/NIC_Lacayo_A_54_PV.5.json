{"speech":{"0":" Please accept our warmest congratulations, Sir, on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly. We wish you every success, which we are convinced will be forthcoming in your leadership and in the outcome of these proceedings. We also wish to convey heartfelt recognition to the Foreign Minister of Uruguay, Mr. Didier Opertti, who so brilliantly presided over the last session, a matter of legitimate pride for Latin America. I should also like to convey a message of warm support and tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the fruitful work that he has been pursuing with commendable energy and great vision, to reform, strengthen and invigorate the complex and sensitive United Nations system within a comprehensive context while looking towards a new century and a new millennium that will revisions, adjustments and adaptations. require all kinds of 5 General Assembly Fifty-fourth session We share and support the initiatives that, among their other objectives, are designed to make it easier for countries that are relatively underdeveloped and engaged in the tasks of economic and social development and combating poverty to achieve the very difficult and painful transition to a new globalized world with a market economy devoid of barriers, where rapidly developing patterns are being imposed with regard to competitiveness, advanced technology, models of culture computer communications, sophisticated systems of financing and a vast array of other this highlights with stark reality the great differences and imbalances that exist at the international level. tools and processes.

Such differences exist and are growing both in advanced countries and in developing countries, which are in the majority. We should anticipate, reverse, mitigate or, at least, temper with realism and sensitivity such negative effects, which owe their origins and characteristics to specific circumstances and considerations that were assumed to be temporary. A failure to take adequate measures could put at risk budding democracies, which are precariously building stability and the institutional structures of law and governance. In this primordial task, the participation of citizens and of civil society, in its various forms, is vital. We must make use of a constant, open and pluralist dialogue to facilitate changes of course, reform and consensus, which will contribute to the strengthening of democratic systems and make it possible for people to live together in peace. 6 5th plenary meeting 20 September 1999 In this context, this year the two main political forces in Nicaragua, which together won a little more than 90 per cent of the vote in the most recent elections, have produced an agenda that will be submitted to the National Assembly for consideration, so that it can be debated with complete transparency in the nation's principal forum. Furthermore, beginning in 1997, my country began a difficult reorganization and structural adjustment process, taking the decision to deal responsibly with the high political and social costs of laying down the stable foundations for dynamic national reconstruction and transformation. We must put behind us once and for all the painful period in our history, which lasted more than a decade and was characterized by destruction and violence in a cycle of fratricidal confrontation and which, fortunately, has now been overcome. That historical interval left us in a very weakened state that was reflected in the deterioration of all human development indicators, the general collapse of economic activities and a gigantic external debt whose unbearable and overwhelming weight was borne on the impoverished shoulders of the long- suffering people of Nicaragua. This situation of extreme fragility made it necessary, from the beginning of my Government, to formulate an economic policy that would gain the support and credibility of the international community and the multilateral organizations. This led to an agreement with for a new the International Monetary Fund (IMF) enhanced (ESAF) programme which, after its projected completion within a period of three years, would have made it possible for us to qualify for the concessionary plan of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. adjustment structural facility While we were occupied with the many sacrifices that we had to make during that tough process of healing, reorganization and reconstruction, a little less than a year ago we suffered the ill-timed and devastating effects of Hurricane Mitch, which severely affected our efforts, work and plans. However, generous international cooperation mitigated to some extent the suffering, the irreparable loss of thousands of lives of our compatriots and the widespread destruction of basic infrastructures, property, natural resources and the environment. The damage inflicted by the tragedy also created new challenges and opportunities, encouraging us to General Assembly Fifty-fourth session redouble our efforts and to seek the necessary unity, joining together without distinction, in efforts to move forward. In May this year, therefore, the Consultative Group for the Reconstruction and Transformation of Central America, convened initially by the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington in December 1998 as a result of Hurricane Mitch, met in Stockholm and offered Nicaragua phased global support amounting to $2.5 billion for a period of three to four years. This significant support will enable us to give urgent attention to social programmes and infrastructure projects, with priority being given to the sensitive areas of health, education and housing, as well as to plans for assistance to small producers and agricultural workers affected by Hurricane Mitch. the of of our The disciplined celebration implementation led last week to an event the ESAF programme and the new set of circumstances ushered in by the hurricane, that happily coincided with national independence â€” a resolution of the International Monetary Fund by which it associated itself with the resolution previously adopted by the World Bank, thereby opening the door to Nicaragua for its inclusion in the HIPC initiative. This extraordinary event, which will mean a substantial pardoning of our external debt, was a historical watershed, opening up a fresh chapter in our new independence, which will transform the economic and social reality of our people, making it possible for them to enter the new century relieved of an unbearable burden inherited from the past, with renewed vigour, great potential and realistic optimism for a substantially improved quality of life for Nicaraguans. community We should like to reiterate our eternal gratitude to the international the multilateral organizations that have smoothed our path, enabling us to march together, shoulder to shoulder, towards a promising future. and to and local development, Nicaragua appreciates the sustained efforts of the United Nations system. Those efforts have been expanded during this decade to incorporate the great challenges and main issues confronting the country, including issues concerning governance the the reduction of promotion of a healthy environment, disadvantaged extreme populations to public services, the modernization of democratic institutions, the promotion of population policies, the process of demobilization of ex-combatants and the search for solutions to property conflicts through dialogue. Likewise, we acknowledge the special efforts made by the United Nations with regard to strengthening poverty, greater access by 5th plenary meeting 20 September 1999 the administration of justice and the penal system, and to the creation of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. It is also appropriate to emphasize its support for the prevention of natural disasters through overcoming socio-economic and environmental vulnerabilities. Working together with the United Nations, we have gradually been fulfilling the commitments of the Earth Summit of 1992 during my term of office in order to create the National Council on Sustainable Development (CONADES). We have also been making strides concerning the Conventions on Biodiversity and Climate Change, as well as participating in the major projects of the Meso-American Biological Corridor the Biological Corridor of the Atlantic. and At the same time, we have been making a consistent effort in the demining of the border zone with Honduras, where the last war left more than one 100 thousand anti- personnel landmines in the ground. We thank the international community, and especially the Organization of American States and the United Nations, for the significant to undertake this delicate task. resources they placed at our disposal As signatory to the Treaty of Tlatelolco, we unreservedly support initiatives aimed at establishing an international mechanism for the total elimination of nuclear weapons. We are also conscious of the grave menace to the security of our nations and to peace posed by arms trafficking, including trafficking in small arms, which cause the greatest suffering and loss of human life. We join in the world crusade to combat poverty, whether that poverty is generalized, focused or in diverse strata of our societies. We are pleased that the last year of this century has been designated the International Year of Older Persons, who seem increasingly to suffer from poverty reaffirm our commitment to ensure social protection, along with the redoubling of efforts to make more effective both the personal security of citizens and the security of their property. neglect. We likewise and to end without I would not want inviting the Assembly to reflect on the hopes of the 22 million persons who, at the threshold of the twenty-first century, continue to lack representation at the United Nations â€” the Organization of universal vocation, where the most important decisions having to do with international policy are taken. The Republic of China â€” founded in 1912 and which has been an independent sovereign nation that 7 General Assembly Fifty-fourth session lamentably and unjustly, maintains official diplomatic relations with Nicaragua and republics of Central America and other the other countries â€” continues, to be unrepresented in the Organization. This prevents it from participating in the work of the Organization and from making its valuable contribution in the various areas of international cooperation, despite the fact it has complied fully with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, which was signed at San Francisco. that fraternal solidarity, firm and My Government has supported and will continue to support, with the unquestionable right of the Republic of China â€” whose exercise of full sovereignty over Taiwan for half a century is an unquestionable reality â€” to be incorporated as a full member of the United Nations. We therefore call anew on the international community not to deny that friendly, progressive and exemplary people the right to be recognized and allowed effective participation in this great forum, thereby affording it the well deserved opportunity of sharing with us its vocation for peace and its generous spirit of international cooperation.
