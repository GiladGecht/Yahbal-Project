{"speech":{"0":" I should be pleased if our neighbours and brothers in Iran would translate their words into action, beginning tomorrow. But it is regrettable that the appeal of Iran for dialogue among civilizations which was announced by President Khatami and which we considered a good omen has since more than one year not been translated into practice between Iran and the Emirates. from this morning The United Arab Emirates launched an appeal more than 10 years ago, asking that an agreement be reached between Iran and ourselves in a serious and creative action. Regrettably, however, as the General Assembly heard the Foreign Minister of the United Arab Emirates, Iran has so far not even responded to the appeal made by the tripartite committee formed by the Gulf Cooperation Council to establish the machinery for a dialogue between Iran and the Emirates. Iran has so far not allowed this committee to visit Iran. I should like the words of the representative of Iran to be translated into action. We will be happy to respond"}}
