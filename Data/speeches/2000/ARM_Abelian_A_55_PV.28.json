{"speech":{"0":" It was not and is not my intention to open a discussion in this General Assembly Hall on the issue of the Armenian genocide and its recognition or on relations between Armenia and Turkey. However, since reference to these issues was made by the representative of Turkey, I would like to make a few points. The twentieth century began for Armenians with the tragedy of genocide and mass deportations in the Ottoman Empire in 1915 and 1923. The first genocide of the twentieth century unfolded in full force and continued until it had consumed the lives of 1.5 million Armenians. That genocide witnessed rape, assault, plunder and the murder of an entire population. their job. The Armenian genocide Reference was made by the representative of Turkey to scholars. I have to say that the scholars have done is well documented in the relevant archives, including the Turkish, British, American and Russian archives. Let me just make a few references to those archives. I would like to repeat the question here asked by British Foreign Minister Lord Curzon at the Lausanne Conference of 1923, directed at Ismet Pasha, then the head of the Turkish delegation. He said: “There were 3 million Armenians in Asia Minor before the war. Now there are only 130,000. Where are the rest? Did they commit suicide or disappear voluntarily?” 31 I would also like to make another reference to a diplomat of that time. The Ambassador of Germany, representing a Government allied with Turkey, also quickly realized what was taking place in 1915. In July 1915, he wrote: “The Turks began deportations from areas not threatened with invasion. This fact, and the manner in which the relocation is being carried out, demonstrate that the Government is really pursuing the aim of destroying the Armenian race in Turkey.” By January 1917, he reported that “the policy of extermination has largely been achieved. The current leadership of Turkey fully subscribes to this policy.” All these archives are available and there is no need for scholars to open or to do new research. It has already been done. Based on those and other facts, even back in 1919, the Kemalist court tried and convicted a number of high-ranking Young Turk officials for their role in what the Turkish Government then called the “massacre and destruction” of the Armenians. The Armenian genocide showed that it could be done. The policy of genocide pursued by the Ottoman Empire went unchecked by other Powers and in time the possibility of such a policy encouraged new brutalities. The most striking evidence of this was the now well-known rhetorical flourish with which Hitler responded to the nervous questions of some of his advisors vis-a-vis the plans for the invasion of Poland in 1939: “Who, after all, speaks the annihilation of the Armenians?” today of Indeed, there is no national history in a vacuum and Turkeys continuing denial of the genocide of the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire has only intensified our aspirations to historical justice. Many nations have found that there is spiritual or moral resurrection in the search for validation through truth and in facing their own past squarely. As President Kocharian of Armenia said in this Hall two weeks ago, addressing the Millennium Summit: “Penitence is not humiliation; rather, it elevates individuals and nations.” () The Armenian genocide is an undeniable fact. When the term “genocide” was invented in 1944 to 32 describe the systematic destruction of an entire people, its author Raphael Lemkin illustrated the term by saying it was the “sort of thing that Hitler did to the Jews and the Turks did to the Armenians”. Many Parliaments of the world have recognized the Armenian genocide. A resolution of the European Parliament in 1987 referred to the fact that the recognition of the Armenian genocide would be viewed as a profoundly humane act of moral rehabilitation towards the Armenians which could only bring honour to the Turkish Government. Regretfully, denial, which has become an integral part of genocide, often reinforces the sense of insecurity, abandonment and betrayal. But denial is the continuation of genocide; some even note that it is the final act of genocide. I would like to again refer to the statement of His Excellency Mr. Vartan Oskanian made here this week as part of the Millennium Assembly general debate. I would like to refer in particular to what he said about how the South Caucasus region continues to remain adversely affected by the lack of formal relations between Armenia and our neighbour Turkey. We did indeed, from day one of our independence, opt for normalization of relations and the establishment of diplomatic ties. But Turkey insisted and continues to insist on certain conditions to Nagorny Karabakh and to the recognition of the Armenian genocide. The economic blockade imposed by Turkey on Armenia of course negatively affects the peaceful solution of the Nagorny Karabakh conflict and seriously hampers the implementation of the most important regional economic programmes. to the peaceful resolution of the Nagorny Karabakh conflict, and we will continue to work intensively with the co-chairs of the Minsk Group to seek peaceful solutions to the conflict. We are equally ready to maintain direct contact with Azerbaijan, in order to search for a compromise. Armenia remains committed related We are confident that constructive dialogue with Turkey, as was mentioned by the Foreign Minister of Armenia, will allow us to jointly pave a way towards cooperation and good-neighbourly relations between our two nations. Mr. Tekle representative of Ethiopia has raised two issues. The first issue, the question of aggression, was dealt with in previous (Eritrea): The meetings, but it does honour to Orwellianism to call the defence of territorial integrity aggression. We are not talking about the past, but rather the commitment to the future. And here it is ones deeds and not ones rhetoric that becomes important. that the peace negotiations — especially It is not unknown to those who have closely the followed facilitators — the Government of Ethiopia launched a systematic undertaking to subvert and render meaningless — indeed to replace outright — the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Framework Agreement with another agreement, which was not only totally alien to, but also contrary to the letter and spirit of the OAU Framework Agreement and the modalities of it had purportedly accepted without any reservations. This campaign started in Algiers on the same day, only three hours after the Algiers agreement was signed, and it was pursued during the Washington, D.C., meeting in early July. implementation — which Not many days after the signing of the Algiers agreement, the Government of Ethiopia resumed its harassment, detention, torture, extra-judicial killing and deportation of innocent Eritreans and Eritreans of Ethiopian origin. Eritrean civilians in sovereign Eritrean territory occupied by Ethiopian forces are being routinely subjected to systematic harassment and terror tactics, as well as torture, rape, confiscation and destruction of homes and property. Fifteen thousand Eritreans were only a few weeks ago expelled from their ancestral places of abode and farms in occupied Eritrean territory. Contrary to the letter and spirit of both the OAU Framework Agreement and the Algiers agreement, the Ethiopian Government has intensified its malicious ethnic hate campaign against Eritreans and their Government. the had undertaken, with These are not deeds of peace. These are deeds of war. Now it cannot to be denied that the Eritrean Government active collaboration of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the voluntary repatriation of two groups of Ethiopians that had been residing in Eritrea. The first group consisted of those Ethiopians who had peacefully and freely resided in Eritrea for a long time, until they, along with their Eritrean co-inhabitants, had been invasion and occupation of Eritrean towns and villages. These people were sharing temporary shelters with displaced internally displaced by the Eritreans — and sharing the meagre supplies that are provided in temporary shelters — and requested the assistance of both the Eritrean Government and the ICRC so that they could return to Ethiopia. The second group consisted of Ethiopians who did not possess valid residency or work permits. They too had requested assistance so that they could go home. These two groups were interviewed by the ICRC. The number of people in both groups was about 11,000. In addition, however, there were very few — a handful, really — who had been expelled because they had become undesirable aliens. In all instances the repatriation strictly adhered to the letter and spirit of the procedures and standards established by the ICRC and recognized by the international community. Now repatriation took place on the same road by which — only a few days earlier — Ethiopian authorities had deported Eritreans and Eritreans of Ethiopian origin. And this repatriation was initially approved by the Ethiopian Government. There is incontrovertible evidence that those who had departed Eritrea had arrived in Ethiopia safely, and thus any stories that may have emanated from Ethiopia about the danger on the road or the harm that befell these people cannot be taken seriously. to doors rights human The Ethiopian Government claims the that Eritrean Government was detaining Ethiopians in camps. This claim would be too farcical for comment if it were not a smear campaign. There are no such camps in Eritrea. Eritrea has throughout the conflict opened its non-governmental organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. In any case, since Eritrea signed the Geneva Conventions, the ICRC is also — in addition to its previous regular visits to Ethiopian civilians — conducting regular visits to Ethiopian prisoners of war. Even before Eritrea signed the Geneva Conventions its record during the liberation struggle and afterwards was recognized by these non- governmental organizations as being one of the best. Can Ethiopia, which signed the Geneva Conventions only three years ago — although it is a founding Member of the United Nations — claim to have such a record? Let the reports of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch serve as witnesses. Mr. Cengizer (Turkey): It is not my intention to dwell here on our disagreements with Armenia. However, after the remarks of the representative of 33 Armenia I am compelled to say a few brief words in response to just two points. The representative of Armenia referred to Lord Curzon inquiring about Armenians. Again, Lord Curzon was not an historian. He was a politician. As a matter of fact, Lord Curzon had every reason to be a partisan and partial politician with regard to Turkey. After all, he was negotiating with Turkey in the aftermath of the First World War and in the aftermath of the triumph of the Turkish struggle. representative of the parallel drawn by Especially — and as a last point — I strongly deplore the Armenian representative concerning Hitler. I would like to remind the there were no Kristallnachts in Turkey, as there were in Germany. And there were no Jewish armed gangs marauding the hills of Bavaria and the streets of Berlin, as we had with Armenians in Turkey. The historical context is vastly different, and I really and strongly deplore the drawing of this parallel to what Hitler did. this: just This concludes my remarks, but I should also say that it is our sincere wish, at this turning of the century, to come to an understanding regarding the tragic events. Of course the Armenian side should also refer to the more than 2 million Turks and Muslims who lost their lives under the same tragic conditions. Mr. Kouliev (Azerbaijan) (spoke in Russian): I am also compelled to respond to the statement by the representative of Armenia in which he referred to the problem of Nagorny Karabakh. The settlement of the problem of Nagorny Karabakh in Azerbaijan is being hampered primarily, as was already stated, by almost ten years of occupation of 20 per cent of the territory of Azerbaijan by Armenian armed formations, as a result of which one out of every eighth inhabitants of my country has become a refugee. Azerbaijan has many times stated to a peaceful settlement of this conflict, but the Armenian side is showing that it does not want to settle this conflict and is preventing the southern Caucasus of conditions favourable for the development of relations with neighbouring countries of the region. the establishment is committed that it in Mr. Hussein (Ethiopia): I very much regret that I have to speak again. We did not intend to use even the first right of reply, but we were forced to do so. I will be brief. We speak of the commitment to the future. Let us practise it. 34 For the record, Ethiopia signed the Geneva Convention fifty years ago — not three years ago — as can be seen from the record. There is a big difference between fifty and three. An ethnic hate campaign was mentioned once again. Just listen to the propaganda that Ethiopia hears day in and day out in the different languages of Ethiopia from the radio in Asmara and, unless ethnic hate campaign is to have a different meaning, we do not have that, as can be seen from the fact that we still have at least 400,000 Eritreans living in Ethiopia, many of them Ethiopian citizens, but half of them citizens of Eritrea. We have many senior Ethiopians of Eritrean origin the Ethiopian Government, including the Foreign Ministry, the Prime Ministers office, the defence forces and so on. That does not describe a country that is practising an ethnic hate campaign — it describes a country that has ethnically cleansed all Ethiopians, a campaign that started at a time when we supposedly had good relations way back it became independent, when thousands of Ethiopians were unceremoniously kicked out without their property and many of them remain interned up to this date. in 1999 before in Finally, only recently in July, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) testified and indicated its concern, not orally, but by issuing a press statement that can be seen by everybody, whereby they indicated their concern by the way the Ethiopians in Eritrea were being kicked out over swollen rivers, areas filled with mines — something I would not call repatriation in a very humane way. I do not wish to be personal but I find it ironic that these statements are being made by someone — when some of us on this side were fighting for the democratization of Ethiopia and also for the rights of the Eritrean people to self- determination — someone who had a very senior post in the Ethiopian Government and who was opposed to the independence of Eritrea. Mr. Abelian (Armenia): I apologize for taking the floor once again, but I would like to make a few additional the representative of Turkey. comments on remarks by the Once again, the end of the general debate in the Assembly is not the place to discuss the recognition of Armenian genocide, but I would like to remind the representative of Turkey that the Armenian genocide began with the Kristallnacht. That was the first day, 24 April 1915, the first day of genocide when more intellectuals were brutally than 300 Armenian murdered by the Turkish authorities, thus signalling the beginning of mass annihilation of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. I must also remind the representative of Turkey that the representative of Armenia did not make a comparison, the comparison was made by Rafael Lempkin, and I quoted him. It was Rafael Lempkin who the comparison of Rafael Lempkin I quote once again: “the sort of things Hitler did to the Jews and the Turks did to the Armenians”. The words quoted were not those of the representative of Armenia. the word “genocide”. And introduced The representative of Turkey also referred to the fact that two million Turks were killed, but Armenians were not involved in those killings, because Armenians had already been killed when those events took place. I wish also to refer to the question of Nagorny Karabakh. As I said in my previous intervention, I would like to repeat, once again, that during the last six years, the military phase of the conflict has ceased and Armenia remains committed to a lasting resolution that will provide for peace and security for Nagorny Karabakh and a continuous link with Armenia and we will work intensively with the chairs of the Minsk group for maintaining the ceasefire regime and I reaffirm we will maintain direct contact with Azerbaijan in order to search for compromise. think However, we that direct negotiations between Armenia and Nagorny Karabakh will be more productive, as it is the people of Nagorny Karabakh who will ultimately determine their own destiny. it could not do so because Mr. Tekle (Eritrea): Very briefly, on two issues of fact. The ICRC was involved in almost all of the voluntary repatriations that took place. When it was not, the Ethiopian Government refused those who benefited from voluntary repatriation could not benefit from ICRC assistance. The report by the ICRC resident in Ethiopia, which was mentioned by the representative of Ethiopia with regard to occurrences in Eritrea, has actually been repudiated by the Headquarters of the ICRC. to cooperate and Finally, I will not indulge myself by answering ad hominem arguments. Ad hominem arguments are the tactics of the weak defending the bankrupt policies of an immoral and illegitimate regime. "}}
