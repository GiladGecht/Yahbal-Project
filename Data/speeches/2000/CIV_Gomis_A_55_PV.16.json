{"speech":{"0":" Allow me at the outset, Sir, to express my delegations satisfaction at seeing you preside over the work of the General Assembly at this fifty-fifth session. You may count on my delegations support. to I also wish The Millennium Declaration also speaks of the need to protect our common environment. My Prime Minister announced during the Summit our intention to become party to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by mid-2002. recall a particular achievement over the past year in the holding of the inaugural session of the United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on Ocean Affairs and the law of the sea. This is a significant step forward in providing an appropriate forum for discussion of cross- cutting oceans issues. The success of this process should be judged by the extent to which there is enhanced global understanding of oceans issues and an increased willingness to cooperate and coordinate cross-sectorally to address them. Finally, the Millennium Declaration sets some key goals for development and poverty eradication and urges meeting the special needs of Africa. This year, New Zealand was able to increase its core funding of the United Nations Development Programme by more than a third and of the United Nations Childrens Fund by almost a half. We believe that the United Nations has a key role to play in the coordination of official development assistance delivery. The preparations for the event on financing for development are an excellent demonstration of leadership by the Organization and a significant step forward in furthering cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions. The crushing and seemingly never-ending debt burden, especially on the countries of Africa, must be urgently reduced. We must also address more scourge of HIAIDS. effectively the Leaders at last weeks Summit provided this Millennium Assembly with a clear direction and a strong mandate. Our countries have delegated us the responsibility to realize that vision of a better world and we must ensure through our efforts and determination that we do not fail them. "}}
