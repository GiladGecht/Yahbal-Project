{"speech":{"0":" I welcome the opportunity and the honour afforded me to speak on behalf of Gabon at this session of the Assembly which, although a regular one, is no less an exceptional one. Indeed, not only does this session prepare us to enter fully into the third millennium but also, and above all, it is being held at a time in the history of humankind to new encouraging prospects in the minds of men throughout the world for a better future. that gives rise This is why, Mr. President, we welcome your election to the presidency of the fifty-fifth session of the Assembly. We are in fact convinced that your qualities as a statesman and your wealth of personal experience are a guarantee for the success of our work. With this in view, Gabon, as a Vice-President, will give you its full cooperation so that this session might effectively meet our expectations. I am pleased to express my deep gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Namibia, for the efficient way in which he discharged his mandate. We, in our turn, would like to warmly welcome the State of Tuvalu, which has just joined the great family of the United Nations. I should like to pay a sincere tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his steadfast efforts to realize the ideals of our Organization. It has been 55 years since (cid:147)We the peoples of the United Nations(cid:148) decided to maintain international peace and security, to achieve international cooperation in solving international economic and social problems and in encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms without distinction as to race, language or religion. These are the primary missions set out in the United Nations Charter, which, in Article 55, recommends the creation of conditions of stability and well-being necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among (cid:151) and, I would add, within (cid:151) nations. increased prosperity for The San Francisco Charter clearly established a close correlation between peace and development. Indeed, without peace there can be no development, and without development there can be no just and lasting peace. We acknowledge that it is difficult to create conditions of the greatest number in an environment where chaos and disorder reign. In this regard, the case of Africa is particularly revealing. When, after the end of the cold war, the world seemed to be developing towards a promising situation because of the gradual reduction of inter-State conflicts, the African continent suddenly fell victim to armed confrontations of unprecedented violence. Dormant antagonisms have been reawakened, with the primary manifestation being the clash of arms and disdain for fundamental humanitarian norms. Several of our countries have come under the yoke of warlords and become chaotic, ungovernable entities that now require humanitarian assistance. Despite the 50 or so peacekeeping operations that it has undertaken since the creation of the United Nations, the Security Council has shown its limitations in the face of crises, especially in Africa. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, Sierra Leone and Somalia are all cases that, in recent memory, have put the solidarity of the United Nations to the test. In the area of development, the world has seen unprecedented economic progress in the past 55 years. Countries that were underdeveloped not very long ago have become dynamic centres of world economic activity. But there is another fact: the vast majority of our countries and peoples remain desperately poor. In his message to commemorate the World Day of Peace, His Holiness Pope John Paul II wrote, (cid:147)At the beginning of a new century, the one issue which most challenges our human and Christian consciences is the poverty of countless millions of men and women.(cid:148) According to the report () of the Secretary- the Organization dated the work of General on 19 30 August 2000, almost half of the world(cid:146)s population must content itself with living on less than $2 per person per day. So it is that 300 million Africans do not have even $1 a day on which to subsist. Furthermore, this poverty is being made worse, in particular by the rapid spread of AIDS, another scourge that has ravaged, brought suffering to, divided and decimated entire families in Africa and throughout the world. In some African countries, AIDS has even become the main cause of death. These are factors for destabilization. While they are all different, together they create disorder and make international relations uncertain. But I do not intend merely to provide a list of all the evils with which the Assembly is only too well acquainted and the United Nations is constantly dealing. Nor should we neglect the efforts undertaken and the progress achieved. Rather, I should like to stress (cid:151) here I am in agreement with the Assembly (cid:151) that the United Nations and the multilateral system do not have sufficient resources to face these major challenges. We have been working at this for a long time now. We cannot now give in to discouragement. We are duty- bound to give the necessary impetus to our action. How are we to do this? First, by moving from a culture of war to a genuine culture of peace. Gabon(cid:146)s dedication to the ideal of peace, which is a constant element of its foreign policy, draws its strength from the same roots as the Bantu civilization. We have a duty to give pride of place to the virtues of dialogue and tolerance among peoples and nations (cid:151) virtues that we practise in our homes and families, and that my country, through the personal intercession of President Omar Bongo, a tireless mediator, has made into a principle of political and diplomatic culture. We must therefore return to our roots. That is, we should go back to those traditional precepts that have greater force today than ever before, given that today, peace is most often threatened not from outside our territories but from within. We must adapt the United Nations Charter to these new situations, in particular by adjusting the mandate of the Security Council with regard to internal crises. It is in this context that we welcome the issuance of the report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations, presided over by Mr. Brahimi. We are convinced that this report will help to promote a new approach to peacekeeping operations. Although 20 peacekeeping operations are necessary as a means of responding, they are nevertheless insufficient. What is at stake in the third millennium is not simply the achievement of ceasefires among adversaries in open conflicts, but the ability to nip conflicts in the bud through action designed to eliminate the deep-rooted causes of violence. to An important step would be the creation or strengthening of regional security machinery to allow us and negotiation, thus enabling us to considerably reduce military expenditure and allocate the resources thereby released to other development needs. through dialogue resolve conflicts At the subregional level, therefore, Gabon is contributing, in cooperation with the other States of Central Africa, to the establishment of a climate of confidence after implementing preventive diplomacy. The heads of State of our subregion have, for example, set up the Council for Peace and Security in Central Africa (COPAX), a body for military and political cooperation between the member States of the Economic Community of Central African States, to promote measures to maintain and consolidate peace and security. COPAX has a multinational force for Central Africa and an early-warning mechanism for Central Africa. The Gabonese Government has taken practical and financial steps for the effective start of MARAC(cid:146)s activities, for which it is the headquarters. However, it goes without saying that it is with the support of the United Nations and other partners that this instrument will play its role fully. In a broader similar framework for joint action, cooperation, development, prevention, management and conflict resolution, the Gulf of Guinea commission, made up of neighbouring Nigeria and seven coastal central African States, was created on 19 November 1999 in Libreville. regional context, a Finally, it is important to strength the multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation machinery. Gabon, which ratified the Convention banning anti-personnel landmines, the Convention banning chemical weapons and the Treaty banning nuclear testing, will continue to actively support international disarmament efforts by encouraging the process that has been set in motion of combating the illicit trade in light arms and small weapons. The convening, in the summer of 2001, of an international conference on that trade is important, since it is quite clear that most conflicts in Africa and elsewhere in the world are fed by traffickers in arms, drugs and diamonds, and are supported by, among things, a number of major multinational other corporations ill-gotten gains, providing arms and drugs to the conflict zones and participating in money-laundering operations. that benefit from We also unreservedly support the creation of the International Criminal Court, and strongly advocate the rapid entry into force of the Rome Statute. With regard to strengthening the fight against poverty and the initiation of new cooperation in the service of development, the African continent accepts that it bears the primary responsibility for its economic recovery and that success in this task depends mainly on its own efforts. But, at a time when the world is happily entering twenty-first century, Africa, marginalized, is prey to destitution and poverty. The scope of the crisis it is experiencing and the importance of the resources to be made available require that the international community support its efforts through increased of commerce and trade and debt relief. concessional expansion resources, the Cooperation on this painful issue of poverty was discussed last January in Libreville by the heads of State and Government of sub-Saharan Africa and the Bretton Woods institutions, at a conference where a new approach to poverty eradication was proposed, with a target date of 2015. During that economic summit the heads of State and Government made recommendations on considering the continent(cid:146)s prospects at the dawn of the new millennium and on the challenges to be faced in speeding up economic growth and eradicating poverty. There is no doubt that poverty eradication requires much quicker economic growth, with its fruits benefiting the greatest number. In this regard, social justice is a useful guide if we wish development and economic growth to produce beneficial results that are more equitably shared. Our heads of State and Government committed themselves to redoubling their efforts to promote solid and sustainable growth in order to reduce poverty. Furthermore, they reiterated their determination to speed up the process of subregional and regional integration already begun with the creation of the African Union this year in LomØ. An open and interdependent world needs mechanisms to retain its balance and to help promote justice by preventing aggression against individuals and nature. It also needs participation in development for all countries and peoples and efficiency in economic transparency, predictability and stability in international relations. relations by encouraging the view of many experts (cid:151) One solution would be (cid:151) and on this point I agree with for international development cooperation to cover not only assistance, but also all activities necessary to guarantee sustainable development the world based on the individual. throughout We could then agree that development assistance first contributes to creating national conditions for development and is obviously popular participation and effectiveness. to combating poverty, which incompatible with justice, in order As necessary as the achievement of food self- sufficiency throughout the world may appear, the national capacity of the developing world should be the effective strengthened implementation on environmental liberalization, macroeconomic management and banking supervision, which are so essential to the proper functioning of a globalized economy. of protection, international agreements facilitate trade to Looking back at history, one can see that after the Second World War development cooperation was synonymous with solidarity and aid: assistance from the richest countries to the poorest. It is time for this cooperation to be transformed, made more dynamic and, above all, become part of the new fact of globalization. fulfil its mission more The recent ministerial meeting initiated by Mr. Mark Malloch Brown, the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), highlighted the need to strengthen the institution(cid:146)s capacity in order to effectively. This strengthening is particularly necessary, since today, more than ever before, it is not possible to conceive of development environmental requirements duly into account. UNDP could, for instance, intensify its assistance to countries that draw part of their resources from forest products to achieve sustainable and ecologically viable management of the forests. without taking 21 With regard to strengthening protection of the environment, the debate under way in the United Nations, which consists of blaming only the forest countries, is unjust, since we know that the greenhouse gas emissions produced by the industrialized countries are largely responsible for the harm done to our planet. Passing responsibility back and forth would not be constructive. To the contrary, we should rather search together, in the spirit of the 1992 Rio Conference, for ways and means to enable us all to preserve the balance of our natural ecosystem. I turn to the alleviation of the crushing external debt burden. On this crucial point, my country devotes nearly half its annual budget to repaying debt, thereby compromising its efforts and chances for development. The debt relief mechanisms advocated in recent years have been discriminatory with regard to our country by excluding us from their application. We say that the reasoning is unfair, being based on our high per capita gross domestic product, without taking into account seriously either disproportionate distribution of national income between capital, labour and taxation. ability pay our the or to A study carried out recently by a team of university specialists in Gabon shows that less than 40 per cent of our gross domestic product is likely to cause a multiplier effect locally. The peculiar situation of Gabon, the only country in the so-called intermediate-income category in sub- Saharan Africa, is due to the fact that its wealth is produced by, and for, external protagonists. is to the Thus is at stake the appeal made the strengthening of international community for a fairer treatment of my country(cid:146)s debt and that of others is not simply a form of begging. What the international trading system for the benefit of all, so that globalization, as the Secretary-General has quite rightly said, might become a positive force for all of humankind. The debt problem remains a major source of concern for African countries, not just my own. We believe some imagination rather than coming up with the same tired solutions. that our partners should show That is why, in considering the debt problem, account should be taken not only of socio-economic indicators but also of the efforts made by a State to combat poverty the the deterioration of and 22 environment. We will say it again: helping the South helps the North and helps everyone. of the The developing status countries, particularly those of Africa, requires broad-based action on the part of the international community in order to translate into reality our duties of solidarity towards peoples. Official development assistance continues to decline. Following up on the recommendations of the Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development, recently reaffirmed in Geneva, my country, in its fight against poverty, the initiative (cid:151) that is, 20 per cent of its national budget and 20 per cent of official development assistance are allocated to basic social services. We all know here that the initiative is an excellent way to combat poverty. implementing is now Regrettably, Gabon(cid:146)s efforts have been hampered the dizzying decline in official development by assistance and its exclusion from the benefits of external concessional financing. I turn now to the protection of vulnerable peoples and the fight against HIAIDS. Another aspect of political and social problems in Africa and throughout the world is the status of women and children in society. In my country, women have the same rights as men. Our educational system ensures free schooling for all school-age children, in the interests of the Gabonese nation as a whole. School enrolment has risen from 27 per cent in 1950 to more than 90 per cent today. Furthermore, my country is resolutely committed to promoting and protecting the rights of the child. Accordingly, we hosted in February 2000 in Libreville an international conference on trafficking in children and on child labour. for the We call implementation of the recommendations of that conference, which are a direct follow-up to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and its two additional Protocols, signed here by the head of State of Gabon. Regarding the campaign against HIAIDS, I am pleased to inform the Assembly that, at the initiative of President Bongo, the Gabonese Government has just created a national solidarity fund to combat this pandemic. Gabon believes that the creation of an international solidarity fund to combat AIDS would no doubt help the 35 million people stricken with this illness, the majority of whom are in developing countries, especially in Africa. I turn now to the reform and restructuring of the United Nations system. In his report entitled (cid:147)We the peoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty- first century(cid:148), the Secretary-General emphasized the need to renew the United Nations. This renewal requires that we identify the major assets of the United Nations, rebuild its infrastructure and information- technology capacities, and continue the peaceful revolution (cid:151) that is, the reforms begun in 1997. In this context, it is necessary to revise the scale of assessments. It is in the interest of us all that we readjust the scale of assessments, so that the burden of the Organization(cid:146)s expenditures, and its freedom of action, does not rest on the shoulders of only a few Member States. thereby The current millennium, a symbol of divine generosity and perfection to which we are bearing witness, has the potential to give rise to further progress in the building of a more just and peaceful world. Every nation represented here is a reflection of humankind, whose common values were recalled by the founders of the United Nations. Humanity is itself in the image of God, and we must therefore together bring to fruition the precious gifts bestowed by our Creator: love, peace and freedom. The United Nations must retain what has shown itself to be tried and true, adapt where necessary and devise new forms of regulation. "}}
