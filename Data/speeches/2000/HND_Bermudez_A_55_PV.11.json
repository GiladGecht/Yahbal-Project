{"speech":{"0":"154), Minister for Foreign Affairs of Latvia. Mr. Berzin(cid:154) (Latvia): Finding ourselves in a new century and in a new millennium, it is natural to review what we have done right and to meditate also on what we could have done better. The United Nations is the forum and the system that allows us to contemplate the status of the world(cid:146)s development from the widest possible perspective. Latvia is small, but the success of our democracy and the success of our efforts at European integration will have a strong positive effect on the destiny of the Baltic Sea region. The success of an Organization like the United Nations can be measured by how its work has affected the lives of individual people in all countries. In the age of globalization the challenge we collectively beneficiaries. face is to ensure that all can be the importance of As a result of the revolution in information technology, the world has grown smaller. Nations and people are closer to each other than ever before. This underlines the principle of universality. Today the decisions taken in one part of the globe affect people and nations all around the world. This calls for wider representation and, in the case of the United Nations, for the reform of the Security Council, which needs to be carried out to reflect the present political and economic realities. To respond to modern challenges, the United Nations needs both political will and courage. In this regard, I would like to express my appreciation to the Secretary-General for his efforts in strengthening and modernizing the Organization through its reforms. to prevent and manage The United Nations also needs to be better conflicts. equipped Unfortunately, the demand for peacekeeping is still high. The Member States, both individually and collectively, must do more to meet this demand. Latvia has done its best to make its practical contribution to peace and security. During the past year Latvia(cid:146)s peacekeepers have been present in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo as a part of North Atlantic Treaty Organization-led forces. In accordance with the United Nations decision to extend the mandate for the operation its participation and will allocate more resources for peacekeeping operations in next year(cid:146)s budget. in Kosovo, Latvia will continue As a future member of the European Union, Latvia attaches great importance to the development of a common European security and defence policy that will increase the European capabilities in conflict prevention and crisis management. We are willing to contribute our forces and to participate in European Union operations. reforms of implemented to reflect To provide the United Nations with proper tools the scale of for peacekeeping, the contributions must be the capabilities and responsibilities of every Member State. At the same time, the United Nations must ensure that the resources are spent wisely and operations managed properly. For its part, Latvia is considering a review of its contribution to the peacekeeping budget with a view to gradually increasing its share. Human rights must remain high on the agenda of the United Nations in the twenty-first century. As a member of the Commission on Human Rights and its Bureau, Latvia remains strongly committed to the strengthening of the United Nations human rights mechanisms. In particular, the role of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and its programmes, including the development of national capacities for the promotion and protection of human rights, should be strengthened. Latvia remains committed to the establishment of the International Criminal Court. We welcome the efforts of its Preparatory Commission in tackling the task of finalizing the texts of the rules of procedure and evidence, and the elements of crime, in a timely manner. Those who commit crimes against humanity must not go unpunished. Fifty years of foreign occupation left us with a heavy social, economic and psychological burden. From the time of our return to independence in 1991, Latvia has made every effort to overcome this legacy. To be successful in the new millennium, we need the consolidated input of all our people, regardless of their occupation, ethnicity or place of residence. That is why the Latvian Government has elaborated its programme of integration of society. This is an experiment and in many ways unique. The integration programme is our vision of how our society can function most effectively on the basis of democracy and respect for human rights. This programme complements the integration measures being implemented through education with the United Nations Development the help of Programme. The programme will increase public participation and it will reduce differences among the various regions of Latvia. It is a sign of Latvia(cid:146)s readiness to explore new ways of improving the living standards and the social climate. the people of Latvia and Latvia(cid:146)s international role has grown in the past decade of freedom. Each year we are able to do more for international community. With the beginning earlier this year of talks for European Union membership, Latvia entered a new phase in its international relations. This November Latvia will assume the presidency of the Council of Europe (cid:151) our first presidency in a pan-European organization. the 7 Latvia is determined to participate even more actively in the work of the United Nations. Therefore Latvia has put forward its candidacy to be a non- permanent member of the Security Council for the period of 2006 to 2007. I believe Latvia is ready to assume this high responsibility. It is an honour to present Latvia(cid:146)s perspective here today at the outset of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I wish all of us a very useful and productive session. "}}
