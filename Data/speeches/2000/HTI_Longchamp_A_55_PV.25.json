{"speech":{"0":" The Republic of Haiti wishes to add its voice to all those who have already congratulated Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this opportunity also to pay tribute to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab for the success with which he guided the work of the fifty-fourth session. its fifty-fifth session. We take I convey warm regards to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who has made a remarkable contribution to enhancing the confidence placed in the Organization. The Republic of Haiti welcomes the admission of Tuvalu to membership of the United Nations. There is no question but that this session should focus on how to implement the decisions taken by our heads of State or Government during the Millennium Summit with a view to forging a policy of effective global cooperation for the twenty-first century. Despite all the criticism one could legitimately level at the Organization after 55 years, the United Nations system remains the sole worldwide structure that can provide collective solutions to the problems facing us in the spheres of international security, the environment and economic and social development. The Organization is often found lacking in terms of solutions to problems. But we know very well that this lack of effectiveness is the result of several factors, including a lack of resources and poor management of those that are available, and overlap in the functions of United Nations institutions and agencies. We think it is important to continue to rationalize the functioning of the Organization in order to secure the best results from existing resources. We must remember that entrusting the United Nations with a mandate without providing it with the proper means for fulfilling it has the of undermining the Organizations credibility. consequence inevitable negative and is fact that Last June in Geneva, we took stock of the outcome of the Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development. The assessment was very mixed, not to say negative. The the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and Programme of Action were formulated in response to a world socio- historical situation marked both by a widening gap between North and South and by a distinct incongruity between the positive economic aspects and the negative social aspects of globalization. Social development therefore gains the process of globalization accelerates. in urgency as In spite of all the political and economic difficulties facing the Republic of Haiti, it has made constant efforts to attain the goals of the Copenhagen Summit, as witnessed by the seemingly minor but actually important fact that between 1997 and 2000 Haitis ranking in the United Nations Development Programme human development index rose from 156 to 150. But we know that we are far from reaching acceptable levels of social development. That is why the Haitian Government continues to devote special attention to implementing the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s. least developed countries. Unless The Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries will be held at Brussels in May 2001. It will, inter alia, assess what has been done to strengthen the human and institutional capacities of the these are strengthened, it will be extremely difficult for least developed countries fully the Copenhagen Programme of Action. its social aspects, the question of development will be decisive for the peaceful future of international relations. Statistics remind us daily that the countries of the North and the countries of the South are moving further apart as the changes brought about by globalization continue swiftly. This situation is politically, economically and ecologically dangerous to attain goals of Beyond 19 for the stability of the international system; this could lead in the long term to the spread of areas bereft of law, to sudden migratory flows and to the continued use of armed conflicts and violence as a way of conducting relations between and within nations. Haiti therefore welcomes the fact that a central theme of next years second high-level dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development the identification of ways to integrate developing countries into the world economy in the twenty-first century. partnership will through be The economy of the twenty-first century will increasingly be based on new information technologies and this will be an enormous challenge for the developing countries. Because of this, maximizing cultural resources and local genetic resources for development and for preserving traditional knowledge will become essential for sustainable development, since it offers an appropriate legal framework to enable countries of the South to preserve their intellectual property rights to their genetic resources. Scientific Educational, Implementation of a global policy for economic development will have no really significant effect on real development of the human being if the question of peace is neglected. Peace and development are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. The United Nations and Cultural Organizations constitution states explicitly that “since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed”. It is therefore essential that the concept and the practice of peace become a real culture so as to enable societies and individuals to develop and enrich themselves through the proclamation of 2001 as the “Year of Dialogue among Civilizations”. their cultural diversity. We welcome and Social development the worldwide dissemination of a culture of peace are definitely basic elements here. However, we think that it is important to welcome the idea of integrating them into a wider conceptual and operational dimension — the dimension of human security which places the human being at the very heart of international priorities. Far from harming the interests of the nation-State, human security fully meets its concerns. In fact, human security goes beyond, formally speaking, the natural sphere of action of nation-States to deal with transnational phenomena such as the degradation of the environment, natural 20 disasters and international crime in all of its many aspects which pose serious threats to the control over, and managing of, national affairs. The great challenge today is to work out and implement a programme for human security that establishes, as a yardstick for its success, its ability to release men and women in our world from the slavery of poverty. In our search for solutions to current problems, we need to envisage the reform of our Organization and, in particular, the reform of the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council. is time now for Questions of development are linked to questions of international security and therefore neither of these reforms should be neglected. After years of negotiation and debate, it the international community to the democratization of the Security Council to make it better adapted to the new international realities. It would also be an ideal time to give thought to a thorough reassessment of the veto, which is no longer in keeping with the current state of international relations. consensus reach on a The attainment of these goals will make it possible for our Organization to discharge its twofold mission: guaranteeing peace among nations and assisting the peoples of the earth to develop their potential. it for development. Accordingly, Likewise, the reform of the Economic and Social Council is essential if we want to give the United Nations the tools it needs to confront the challenges of the twenty-first century. This reform should seek to avoid or eliminate the functional overlapping of programmes of action of the agencies of the United system, while developing a policy of Nations partnership is essential to strengthen the functions of the Economic and Social Council that relate to the coordination of funds and programmes. The strengthening of the role of, and the functioning of, the Economic and Social Council this era of globalization. Only the definition and implementation at the multilateral level of coordinated plans of action will make it possible to help, in a meaningful way, the efforts of States to eradicate poverty and to establish a solid basis for comprehensive sustainable development. Our Organization is rightly called a universal Organization. This is why the Republic of Haiti welcomed enthusiastically our unanimous decision to is particularly crucial in admit Tuvalu as the 189th Member. It is only right that the 9,000 inhabitants of that country be properly represented in our world Organization. Therefore the situation of the 23 million Chinese of Taiwan is a matter of concern to us. We welcome the fact that the dialogue-based approach continues to prevail on both sides of the Straits of Taiwan. While we wait for the dialogue to produce satisfactory results for both sides, we the representation of these 23 million people deserves the attention of the United Nations. the question of think that Allow me to conclude by referring to a few figures. According to the latest report on development, produced by the World Bank, one fifth of the worlds population, no less than 1.2 billion people, are living on less than one dollar a day. One out of five children die before reaching the age of five. The World Bank tells us also that the 20 richest countries have an average income which is 37 times higher than that of the 20 poorest countries and this gap is twice what it was 40 years ago. to by development And yet, these last 40 years were all decades international devoted community. There is, therefore, a problem here that I would call the paradox of the twentieth century. Never has humanity attained such a capacity to produce all kinds of goods and riches, and yet never have there been so many people unjustifiably going hungry. the The essential challenge today is for the twenty- first century not to resemble the twentieth in this respect. To make this happen, the mind-boggling constant increase in scientific knowledge must be properly harnessed to the fight against poverty in all of its various manifestations. The United Nations cannot spend another 55 years talking about development: it is time now, it is high time to make development a reality. The entire credibility of the Organization hinges on this issue because, basically, development is another name for peace. Despite the many obstacles we face, Haiti hopes that the community of States will manage to build in this century and in this millennium a world where basic needs will be met, where nature will be protected, where the scourge of drugs and organized crime will be controlled, with opportunities for all, with hopes for a more promising future, in particular for young people and for the disadvantaged.
