{"speech":{"0":" This morning the Israeli delegation raised some baseless accusations against my country. joined the most basic Iran is among those Middle Eastern countries international which have instruments in effect in the disarmament field. My Government is a full party to the main pillars of international disarmament instruments such as the 1925 Geneva Protocol, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Biological Weapons Convention, the Chemical Weapons Convention and is a signatory State to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty. Israel refuses to to accede Despite numerous calls from the international community, those agreements, and is continuing with its clandestine programmes to develop and produce several kinds of weapons of mass destruction. Israel remains the only non-party to the NPT in the Middle East and, at the same time, its nuclear programme and unsafeguarded facilities continue to be an alarming fact that menace peace and stability in the Middle East. Mrs. Barghouti (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic): This morning, we heard the statement by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs of Israel. Needless to say, his statement was, from our point of view, full of historical and political fallacies, especially as regards Al-Quds, the peace process in the Middle East. However, my delegation will have the opportunity to reply and to clarify the facts in the statement that Palestine will make in the plenary meeting tomorrow morning"}}
