{"speech":{"0":" The statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kuwait this morning contained a distortion of facts that requires a reply. the General Assembly to First of all, concerning the issue of those missing in action, the Kuwaiti Minister attempted to politicize the matter and to confine it exclusively to missing Kuwaitis. He claimed the Iraqi Government refuses to participate in the meetings of the Tripartite Commission, whereas the facts of the matter are as follows. that First of all, the matter of the missing in action (cid:151) be they Kuwaitis, Iraqis or of other nationalities (cid:151) is a humanitarian issue that should not be exploited to cheap political ends, such as that of maintaining the embargo against the Iraqi people. While Kuwait has fewer than 600 persons missing in action, Iraq has more than 1,150, whose files are with the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Kuwaiti Government is expected to submit information concerning those missing persons. The Kuwaiti Government is called upon to put an end to the suffering of all the families that do not know the fate of their sons, regardless of their nationality, for human suffering knows no nationality. Secondly, the work of the Tripartite Commission concerning missing persons is hampered by the United States of America and the United Kingdom, which insist on participating in its meetings despite the fact that they are not concerned with its work nor do they have any missing nationals whose fate they would be interested in learning about. However, the United States does have one missing person, a pilot whose plane was shot down over Iraqi territories during the aggression against Iraq in 1991. The United States has not asked that the case of this missing pilot be dealt with within the Tripartite Commission, but rather requested to deal with it on a bilateral level under the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Once again we wish that Iraq endeavours to have the Tripartite Commission meet as soon as possible with the participation of the parties that do have persons missing in action (cid:151) Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq (cid:151) under the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross. to affirm that The Kuwaiti Minister claims the Iraqi Government has not yet complied with the resolutions of the Security Council, neglecting the fact that Iraq has indeed complied with those resolutions, whereas his own Government has been violating those resolutions on a daily basis. All relevant United Nations resolutions have called for respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Iraq. Yet ever since 1992 scores of American and British planes have been taking off daily from bases in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to bombard Iraqi civilian targets, in blatant violation United Nations resolutions, international law and humanitarian international law. We call upon Kuwait to end that aggressive attitude, which represents a serious threat to the security and stability of Iraq and the States of the region. Thirdly, the Kuwaiti Minister claimed that Iraq(cid:146)s intentions towards Kuwait are not peaceful. But the facts do indicate that Kuwait(cid:146)s intentions and actions towards Iraq are aggressive. Kuwait chooses to ignore the facts of history and geography and the collective opinion of the international community, including the Arab States. More than one speaker has affirmed such an opinion, when the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Arab States have asked in this very Assembly that the sanctions against Iraq be lifted in order to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people. Those who prevent the termination of the inhumane sanctions against the Iraqi people are, in fact, the masters of the Kuwaiti Government (cid:151) the Americans and the British, who are interested their own political programme without international legitimacy. in carrying out respect for Mr. Flores (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): My delegation wishes to refer to the mentions made this 41 morning to the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla and to other parts of Spanish territory in the speech that was made to the plenary by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom of Morocco, a country with which Spain maintains and wishes to continue maintaining excellent relations based on sincere friendship, good-neighbourliness, respect and a rich shared history of which we are proud. In underlining the excellency of our relations and the importance that my country attaches to them, I repeat that the cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the adjacent integral part of Spanish territory, whose citizens are represented in the Spanish Parliament with exactly the same status and under the same conditions as the rest of their compatriots. islands are an Mr. Al-Otaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): My delegation listened attentively to the response of the representative of Iraq to the statement of the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Kuwait, and I find it really difficult not to refute some of the contradictions in his response. I find it necessary to clarify the facts that are already known to most Member States and further to reiterate them. is chaired by the Committee(cid:146)s work. Regarding First, regarding the issue of the Kuwaiti prisoners and detainees, Iraq has boycotted the work of the Tripartite Commission, which the International Committee of the Red Cross, since December 1998. This is not the first time Iraq has boycotted the participation of the countries of the alliance (cid:151) the United Kingdom, the United States and France (cid:151) they have participated in the work of the Commission as a result of an agreement concluded by the parties concerned (cid:151) Iraq, Kuwait and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (cid:151) in Riyadh in 1999. The agreement spells out the composition of the Commission and its modus operandi. Iraq is regrettably trying to pull out of that agreement and to renouncing it. Iraq is required by Security Council resolutions 686 (1991), 687 (1991) and 1284 (1999) to resume its participation in the works of its subcommittee and to cooperate with the high-level international coordinator, who was appointed by the Secretary-General in order to facilitate the solution of this humanitarian problem. the Tripartite Commission and What Kuwait is asking for is implementation of the Security Council resolutions and serious and constructive cooperation to solve this problem on a purely humanitarian basis, not linked to any other political issues. What Iraq is doing is linking its participation in the Tripartite Commission to the non- participation of the countries of the Alliance. Secondly, regarding the missing Iraqi persons, despite our information that Iraq has pushed this issue in order to create confusion and divert attention from the main problem (cid:151) the issue of Kuwaiti and third countries(cid:146) prisoners or detainees (cid:151) Kuwait has agreed, for humanitarian reasons, to consider and study any files Iraq might submit. Kuwait has also cooperated seriously with the Tripartite Commission and has expressed receive any committee that might be established to visit prisons or any other places that this committee might deem suitable inside Kuwait. its readiness that to There is a specific mechanism for considering all the files, adopted and approved by all the parties. There is also a timetable that was agreed to during the meetings of the Tripartite Commission and its technical subcommittee. If Iraq were keen to know the fate of the missing Iraqi persons, why did it not attend the meetings of the Commission? The fact of the matter is that the issue of the Iraqi missing persons is not mentioned in any of the resolutions of the Security Council. This is in contrast to the issue of Kuwaiti prisoners and detainees, which is an integral part of the obligations of Iraq, obligations that Iraq is expected to fully meet. Thirdly, regarding Iraq(cid:146)s allegations vis-(cid:224)-vis Security Council resolutions, Kuwait is not the only country that says that Iraq has not fully implemented Security Council resolutions. The Gulf Cooperation Council, the Arab League, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Non-aligned Movement, and the Security Council (cid:151) all such regional and international organizations have called on Iraq to implement the resolutions of the Security Council. This can be seen in paragraph 54 of the Secretary-General(cid:146)s report on the work of the Organization, from which His Excellency the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kuwait quoted in his speech. 42 Kuwait is not responsible for the embargo and the sanctions regime. The Security Council is the sole and only body that has the authority to lift or maintain the sanctions. Kuwait is not a member of the Council. Kuwait is a small country and does not have such influence on all the Council members that it can force maintenance or extension of the sanctions"}}
