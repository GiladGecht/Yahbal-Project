{"speech":{"0":" At the outset I should like to congratulate the President most warmly on his election to preside over the General Assembly at the opportunity to assure him of my delegations full support as he carries out his difficult but uplifting task. I feel sure that with his experience and abilities as an able diplomat he will successfully guide our discussions. fifty-fifth session. I take I should also like to extend my sincere and warm congratulations to his predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for the ability and authority he demonstrated throughout the fifty-fourth session. I also take this opportunity of extending once again to Secretary-General Kofi Annan our full appreciation and support for his constant efforts and resolve to find a better world in spite of the many complex challenges the new millennium. His excellent report, “We the peoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century”, is evidence of this. in Mali welcomes Tuvalu to the Assembly. Its the to membership further strengthens admission universality of the Organization. More than ever before, our world aspires to peace and security and sustainable human development. In this respect, our fifty-fifth session is unprecedentedly important both historically and politically. The exceptional opportunity offered us in the Millennium Summit, which has renewed our hope in humankind, must not be lost. The Millennium Declaration demonstrates our maturity and our elevated sense of responsibility for the future of humanity. Now we must build this better world to which we all aspire. The peoples of the United Nations look to us. They are impatient. More than ever before they want to be actors determining their own future, particularly people who do not have very much, our people. They want to be actors and to benefit from globalization. That is how I see the historical and political meaning of this session, which must give effect to the dynamic now under way. Here, all together, we reaffirm the place and the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security and in cooperation for development, which require that the United Nations become more legitimate by being more democratic and stronger. What I say will be set against this backdrop. The maintenance of faced with violent, deadly international peace and security must remain our priority. The Organization is increasingly internal conflicts that have taken the lives of millions of civilians. It is therefore crucial to improve the system of prevention and strengthen our institutions capacity to organize and conduct operations effectively and successfully. Here I pay tribute to the report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations, led by Lakhdar Brahimi. It is indeed a milestone in the process of trying to make the United Nations “truly credible as a force for peace” (), so we must quickly ensure that it has positive results. As the report rightly emphasizes, United Nations intervention must be decided upon on the basis of uniform criteria, regardless of the region in which conflicts occur. The multidisciplinary nature of new United Nations peacekeeping missions demands clear and precise mandates. Mali welcomes efforts to strengthen cooperation with regional organizations in regard to maintaining peace, while respecting the competence of the Security Council. Recent events in Sierra Leone remind us of this and are a real challenge to us. Efforts by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and subregional organizations must be supported to establish regional capacity. This also applies to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which already has a peacekeeping force and will soon have an early warning system. Peacekeeping operations cannot be a permanent solution to conflicts or an answer to the underlying causes. The international community must move from a culture of reaction to a culture of prevention based on a multidimensional approach, helping to save many human lives and making additional resources available for development. We must also emphasize that the effectiveness of the United Nations in peacekeeping depends largely on its capacity for prevention, crisis management and peace-building. Here I appeal to the to provide a stable and international community healthy base for the Organizations peacekeeping activities. financial 13 I pay tribute to the second Security Council summit held on 7 September, which dealt with the need to give the Council an effective role in the maintenance of international peace and security, particularly in Africa. The resolution that emerged from that summit deserves the support of us all, for it will certainly strengthen our capacity for prevention and crisis management. We must also continue work to free the world from the fear of weapons of mass destruction and face up to the threat of light weapons. With regard to nuclear non-proliferation, the indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) regime, the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention, the signing and ratification of many other treaties on important aspects of disarmament, and the creation of nuclear-weapon- free zones, are all to confidence-building and nuclear disarmament. important contributions for support for moratoriums, Mali is fully committed to work to halt the plague of the proliferation of light weapons. I appeal for regional efforts, greater coordinated support including for embargoes on arms deliveries and the strengthening of controls. The United Nations conference in 2001 on this issue must give the international community an opportunity the excessive destabilizing accumulation of such weapons. The conference must look at all aspects and be fully transparent. take appropriate steps respect to end to I must mention here the troubling issue of children affected by conflict, child soldiers, for the link between the proliferation of light weapons and the intolerable fate of these children is only too obvious. We have a great responsibility for them, and we must put an end to the destruction of so many hopes. The International Conference on War-affected Children, held in Winnipeg, which ended just a few days ago, was an opportunity for us all to strengthen our commitment to guarantee all children better health, school for all, both boys and girls, free from war, violence and famine. by globalization, continuing poverty is our most difficult challenge. The problem of the debt of the developing countries must remain our focus, because it is a major obstacle to their development. Complete cancellation of the debt is needed in the overall framework of finding a new development strategy. This new development strategy involves direct investment, unhampered access to markets through special, differential treatment, fair prices for our goods, and transfers of new technology, all of which are major factors in development. This means that financing development must remain on our agenda. My delegation welcomes the convening in 2001 of a high- the level conference intergovernmental of development cannot be taken up unless there is a stable international financial system. My country advocates a reform of the international financial system that takes account of the social dimension of development and does not jeopardize nations capacity to pursue their national development objectives. to deal with The issue at challenges level. this Africa has understood full well that its role and place in the emerging world implies a renewed political approach of integration and unity of our continent. That is the backdrop to the creation of the African Union, which calls for a united Africa, strengthened by an integrated development of its full potential and a heightened awareness of its strategic advantages. Mali was the first country to ratify the Constitutive Act of the Union, which we are convinced is the springboard for the development of the continent, and for a responsible Africa, an Africa that counts. We must work together to eradicate poverty. We have a responsibility to guarantee all human beings a life of decency and dignity, with equal opportunities for all peoples. We can do this. It requires enhanced cooperation and through a multilateral approach guided by the United Nations. international solidarity We must promote global social development, for we believe that excessive unshared wealth is a poor kind of wealth, a wealth with no social value and therefore contrary to the essence of our life. At the beginning of the third millennium one of the most urgent tasks facing humanity is to end the growing inequality between rich and poor countries. We must tackle the underlying causes of conflict — primarily their economic and social dimensions. In an international environment that is increasingly marked The values that give meaning to the wealth of the world are those of democracy. Here I refer to the strong words of President Konare, who rightly told the community of democracies conference, held in Warsaw, that the development of democracy is the basis for a world of peace, solidarity and social justice, 14 and that only democracy can allow each of us to shoulder the burden, but also the honour, of being a human being and serving humankind. “What an honour it is to be a human being!” he said. The Ministerial Conference on Security, Stability, Development and Cooperation in Africa said rightly that democracy, good governance, respect for human rights, the rights of peoples, and the rule of law, are prerequisites to achieving security, stability and development in Africa. Nothing must prevent open discussion of ideas and the promotion of political pluralism. Despite inadequacies, difficulties and sometimes violent breakdowns, the democratic process is gaining ground in Africa. A democratic Africa is becoming increasingly real, but it is still a fragile reality that must be supported and helped. Mali welcomes the adoption last June by the [Community of Democracies] of the Warsaw Declaration, advocating the strengthening of cooperation among democratic countries with a view to sharing the best practices, protecting themselves against threats to democratic processes, and promoting the emergence of a partnership forum to help democracies in transition. We must be strong against unconstitutional change of political regimes so that we can strengthen democracy. We must condemn such changes as a matter of principle and there must be consequences. President Konare said that pressure must be credible and can only attain its goal if the international community adopts a firm consistent and constructive approach in the event of any putsch or attempted coup detat. It must avoid encouraging those who are tempted to violate republican and democratic rules by removing any ambiguity. In international community must be clearer and more rigorous in its approach and support the OAU which seeks to deter putsches by taking a clear position and by imposing political sanctions. Could this position not also be taken up in the United Nations? this respect, the Along the same lines the establishment of the International Criminal Court with the Rome Statues would be a permanent body to act against impunity. It would allow us to try those responsible for the most horrible crimes and it would also be a tool for deterrence that could contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. Mali has already ratified the Courts Statute, thus showing that it supports the struggle against the culture of impunity and to ensure respect for human dignity. In view of the progress in achieving some settlement in the Lockerbie matter, we would call for the definitive and immediate lifting of sanctions that are unjustly inflicting suffering on the brother people of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. We must be careful about sanctions because of the humanitarian cost involved. We must use more effective, targeted sanctions. On the Korean peninsula we welcome the recent inter-Korean summit and the exchange visits by peoples of both countries. We welcome and support these initiatives which begin a direct dialogue between the parties involved and promote peace and stability in the Korean peninsula. HIAIDS jeopardizes the future of millions of men, women and children in Africa and it is also a threat to international peace and security. A failure to deal with this would be culpable and suicidal indifference. In this connection we fully support the proposal to convene a special session of the General Assembly on AIDS. Adapting the United Nations to the requirements of the age is absolutely essential. The challenges facing us in the political, economic and social areas force us to demonstrate creativity and realism so that we can come up with innovative and constructive suggestions and translate them into action in the true interests of our peoples. My delegation believes in the need to democratize the United Nations further, to restructure all its principal organs. Reform of the Security Council will give effect to our desire to modernize this important organ that the Charter makes primarily responsible for threats to and breaches of international peace and security. A reformed Council must be more transparent in its working methods, more democratic, more its membership, and it must be more credible in the way it is perceived by other member States. Mali reaffirms Africas demand for equitable distribution of seats in the two categories, pursuant to the Harare Declaration adopted by the OAU Summit of Heads of State or Government. representative, more legitimate in More than ever before the human being must be the very heart of the new millennium. The peoples expect the United Nations to promote and ensure a world of progress for all, a world of peace, a world of sharing. In this respect Mali sees the Millennium 15 Declaration as the fabric we can use to build a better world. Now is the time for action. The Acting President from Arabic): I now give the floor to the next speaker, His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, Chairman of the delegation of Qatar. (interpretation (Qatar) (interpretation Mr. Al-Nasser from Arabic): I should like at the outset to extend my congratulations to Mr. Holkeri on his election to preside over the work of this important fifty-fifth session. It is indeed important because it is the first session in the new millennium. We are confident that his experience and diplomatic capability will be, God willing, great assets in our effort to achieve the desired success. I also extend my sincere thanks to the President of the fifty-fourth session, His Excellency Dr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, and friendly country, Namibia, noting that his outstanding efforts had a tremendous impact on solving numerous difficulties and achieving good results in many matters during the past session. I should further like to express my thanks and appreciation to His Excellency, Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who tried his utmost and has not compromised, in his effort to realize the goals aspired to by all peoples of the world. We also appreciate his endeavour in preparing the report before us. to his A few days ago the world witnessed a great event in time and place, hosted in this building. This very same hall was crowded with a unique assemblage of world leaders who came from every corner of the globe to attend the Millennium Summit. The attendance of so many leaders and their desire to participate signifies many things, most important of which is their firm recognition of the role of the United Nations, which represents the hope of the peoples of the world for the achievement of a peaceful coexistence that guarantees security, peace and well-being for all. The Summit Declaration has deeply impressed us all. We trust that the role of the United Nations will grow stronger when States, particularly the great Powers, look beyond their narrow, short-lived interests, work in the interests of this Organization, and firmly abide by its Charter for the settlement of disputes by peaceful means and by resorting to the international judicial system. That would be a civilized demonstration of the progress achieved by nations and an acknowledgement of the significance and fairness of the rule of law, which is an instrument of security and peace, whose decisions deserve respect and full obedience. 16 its international organizations We, in the State of Qatar, under the leadership of Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the dearly beloved Emir of the country, give the United Nations and all their due appreciation and respect as part of the philosophy of our system, which is based on truth and justice, both internally and externally. We consider democracy and human rights to be essential targets that we strive to attain according to our special cultural, religious and social characteristics. We thank God that we are aiming in the right direction. As the Assembly is well aware, we live in a region that has for two decades been plagued by disasters and crises. No sooner does one problem calm down than another erupts like an active volcano. But many good people from the Arab Gulf, and honourable people and lovers of peace from other parts of the world, are trying their best to establish security in a region of great importance to present civilization, as the region has embedded in it a sizeable portion of the sources of energy needed by all. No sooner had the Iraqi-Iranian war, which devastated the region and left it with bleeding wounds, come to an end and people had hopes of a period of rest during which the wounds could be healed, than another crisis occurred, greater in dimensions and more complex this time, namely, the second Gulf War, the invasion of Kuwait and its liberation and the economic boycott of Iraq, which has gone on for a decade so far, killing people, particularly children, the ill and the ageing. All of us now know that the sanctions have failed to achieve the goal for which they were established. Their course has changed so much that they have become like a plague afflicting people. Not only do we call for the lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq and putting an end to the suffering of its people, but also for a reconsideration of the issue of imposing sanctions, whether by individual States or through the United Nations, for recourse to sanctions has completely failed, leaving behind merely rancour and hatred. In referring to the humanitarian situation in Iraq and realizing that humanitarian matters are indivisible, we welcome the Secretary-Generals appointment of Yuli Vorontsov to be his representative regarding the fate of Kuwaiti prisoners and missing persons, so as to bring this phase of human suffering to an end. The State of Qatar sincerely hopes that through concerted bilateral and regional efforts a solution will be found to the problem of prisoners and missing persons, whether they be our Kuwaiti or Iraqi brothers. the “Lockerbie” question. We commend In this context I should like to note that last year my Government welcomed the positive development and the progress that had been made for the settlement of the cooperation and positive response by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and its fulfilment of its obligations. On the other hand, we and inevitability of lifting the sanctions imposed on Libya, which had been temporarily suspended, because the whole issue had been referred to a court following the extradition of the two Libyan suspects. Consequently, there legal the continuation of such sanctions. the necessity justification emphasize is no longer for to at referred judicial system The principle of dialogue or recourse to the international the beginning of my address, fully applies to the dispute between the Emirates and Iran over the occupied islands. The State of Qatar strives, within the tripartite committee established by the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes our sister States the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Sultanate of Oman, to reach a solution acceptable to both parties through bilateral dialogue or recourse to international arbitration. on based peace Similarly the Middle East question is foremost in our priority concerns. An endeavour to solve this question was launched but it faced obstacles and impediments that prevented the attainment of the much-sought-after legitimate international resolutions, particularly Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which were the foundations of the peace process. The Arabs consider peace their strategic option, yet a comprehensive peace is still beyond reach, owing to Israeli intransigence, inflexibility and disregard of the basic rights of the Arab nation. This intransigence was an impediment to peace on the Syrian-Lebanese track. Israels refusal to withdraw to the 4 June 1967 borders did not meet the minimum conditions placed by the Syrian Arab Republic, consistent with United Nations resolutions. Simply because of a few metres Israel wasted a rare chance for peace. The situation on the Palestinian track, which is the core and crux of the dispute in the region, is no better. At the Camp David summit the Government of Israel proved that it was captive to the extremist wing of its people and that it was not mature enough to take the brave decision of bringing to an end a conflict that has lasted for half a century. Moreover, Israels insistence on the occupation of East Jerusalem is provocative to the feelings of millions of Muslims and Christians throughout the world. Israel must abide by Security Council resolution 242 (1967), on the basis of which the peace process was launched and which calls for its withdrawal from all Arab lands to the borders of 4 June 1967. Furthermore, the conflict will not come to an end without solving the question of Palestinian refugees, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 194 (III). This leads to the question of Israeli settlements in occupied Arab territories. These settlements are time bombs standing in the way of any resolution to the conflict. Extremist Zionists planted these settlements to block any peaceful solution, in contradiction of numerous General Assembly and Security Council resolutions that explicitly declare them illegitimate. The State of Qatar, declaring its full support of the legitimate Arab demands on the Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian tracks, hopes that the voice of reason, love and peace will eventually prevail, that a just and lasting peace in the Middle East will be achieved, and that an independent Palestinian all Palestinian national territory with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, will be established. The United States of America, whose efforts in the peace process are appreciated, is called upon more than at any time in the past, to exert pressure on Israel to respond to the this historic challenges of peace and not miss opportunity as a short-lived ambitions; the alternative to the peace process is too dangerous for international peace and security, and could lead us all into a maze whose outcome would be known only to God. result of narrow, ruling state, over The State of Qatar supports attempts made at national reconciliation in our sisterly State, the Sudan, and endorses the efforts of the Sudanese Government in this respect, and hopes that goodwill and sincerity will lead to consensus so that peoples efforts will be directed towards development and reconstruction. At the same time it requests that foreign parties refrain from prolonging the crisis at the expense of the brotherly people of the Sudan, who pay the price with illness, hunger and blood. We also support the President and the Government of Djibouti to solve the elusive and chronic Somali problem, and thank God tireless efforts of the 17 the that those efforts have been fruitful. Here we extend to His Excellency, President our congratulations Abdikassim Salad Hassan, elected Somali President. We wish him and his Government every success. We assure him that he will find in the State of Qatar the necessary help and support in order to sail the boat of national reconciliation safely to land. We also hope that our Somali brothers will help treat each others wounds, put an end to the chaos and destruction that has befallen their country for a decade, and respond to the hopes and aspirations of their people, who dream of security, peace and a life of honour and freedom, like all peoples of the world. This leads us to the entire region of the Horn of Africa, where war, drought and famine have inflicted untold suffering on its people, with whom we have relations of kinship and neighbourhood. We wish them stability and every good, and we hope that their efforts will be directed towards action and construction. The State of Qatar looks closely and with concern at what is plotted against our sisterly State, Indonesia, the most populous Muslim State and one that has a prominent place in the minds of all Muslims. Intrigues are being secretly contrived to dissect this peaceful Muslim State under the pretext of human rights and other means of deception that fool nobody. We emphasize our strong and unreserved support for the sovereignty of Indonesia over all its territories, and for its territorial integrity and national unity. Events in Indonesia constitute a domestic affair, the like of which occurs in many States in the world. The Indonesian Government, God willing, is capable of putting an end to such problems among its citizens, regardless of their race, religion or orientation. We realize too that financial difficulties and poverty are among the main factors of these internal problems. It is hoped that this session, the first in the new millennium, will give us a strong impetus to reflect on our world today with all its disparities embodied in the daily life of hundreds of millions of people. A close scrutiny of the world will reveal a rich, developed North enjoying prosperity, democracy, economic stability and ample opportunities for creativity and innovation, and a poor South, many of whose States try hard to catch up with the march of civilization and the progress and utilize all their capabilities for development and the advancement of their people. However, other States of the South continue to suffer from war and conflict both infrastructures their of 18 between States and among citizens of the same country, thus causing their suffering to increase and their resources to be wasted on acquiring weapons instead of being used for education, health and the building of infrastructures. indebtedness and those crises are Since economic factors contribute enormously to the continuation of wars and disputes, it is incumbent upon us to solve the causes of these crises. That can only be achieved with the cooperation of all, particularly the rich States of the North. Foremost among the accumulation of interest that exhaust the income of many States of the South. We hope that the States of the North and their creditor institutions will respond to the numerous appeals to write off, either wholly or partially, the debts or interest of the poorest countries which strive to upgrade their fragile economies. We must also conduct a comprehensive review of the international an international conference in which all countries of the world participate, with the aim of establishing a wise, fair and just pilot policy for the world economy in the new millennium, taking into consideration the issue of development in third world countries and directing investment and capital towards the establishment of a genuine partnership that promotes such development. banking holding system by Globalization has impacted every region and transformed the world into a small village, no part of which can be separated from the other parts. Therefore, the transfer of technology, especially information and communications technology, must be accompanied by transparent selective globalization wherein third world countries are no more than markets for the products of developed countries and large corporations. globalization, rather than The process of reforming the United Nations attracts the attention of all States, and I have referred to it on other occasions at past sessions. The Secretary- Generals efforts are outstanding in this respect. For the realization of an active Organization responding harmoniously to contemporary requirements, its work has to be activated, the number of its employees who drain its resources has to be cut back, and the dynamics of its work, both at Headquarters and in its bodies, organs and offices elsewhere, have to be changed. Moreover, the process of reforming the Security Council requires the Working Group to proceed until it achieves the goal for which it was established. The Working Group has indeed gone a long way in that respect, particularly with regard to the second cluster relating to procedural matters in the work of the Council. As for expanding the Council and increasing its membership, the State of Qatar is committed to the position of the Arab Group and the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement that calls for a minimum increase of up to 26 members, taking into consideration equitable geographical distribution and the fact that the last increase in its membership took place in 1963. We also endorse the continuation of the Working Group, which, God willing, will reach a consensual solution. At the same time we emphasize the right of the Arab world to a permanent seat in any impending increase. interpretation or application. Intervention A few terms and ideas have recently gained currency, and though they sound good they imply a great threat to States and nations. Danger is not inherent in these terms but is rather a consequence of their in humanitarian cases is one of these ideas that can be exploited by the great Powers to justify interference in the internal affairs of States and the violation of their national sovereignty. Promotion of democracies in the world, the code of conduct and good governance are all relative, and if they were to be used according to their present interpretation, the world would run according to a single style of democracy and one culture would prevail. This is so serious that it would eliminate pluralism, which is an enriching factor in the work of the United Nations, since it indicates diversity and difference among peoples and nations. This very same diversity contributes positively interests, promotes humanitarian and cultural exchanges and enables each of us to accept other cultures and coexist with them. True democracy is one that is freely chosen by any people for its mode of governance without outside intervention. to world The year 2001, the United Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations, may offer us a good opportunity to demonstrate more tolerance and communication among nations for the benefit of humanity. I should like here to refer to the address by His Highness, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the beloved Emir of Qatar, on 5 September 2000 when the dialogue among civilizations initiative was launched, and to His Highnesss emphasis on the significance of dialogue and communication as an alternative to dispute and conflict. is linked to Members Peacekeeping forces play a very important role, establishing security and stability in many different regions suffering from conflict and war, and as time passes, the cost of operating these forces rise. At this session the Fifth Committee will discuss the issue of contributions to these forces. We maintain that the Fifth Committee is the best forum for this, but since this process assessed contributions to the regular budget, we believe that finalizing the scale of assessments first is a reasonable priority. Our delegation will actively take part in the work of that Committee with the aim of reaching a consensus, without which we cannot find a solution to the problem of committing any State to something it cannot meet in the future. We stress that all aspects of the economic situation of each State should be considered, particularly the emerging economies that rely on one source of income and that are subject to market volatility. My country is one of those States. Finally, the State of Qatar firmly believes in the importance of the role of the United Nations in establishing security, stability and peace throughout the world, and it also believes in the importance of respecting the United Nations Charter and its lofty goals, and the need to adhere to the Charter in international relations. We trust and hope that the future will be bright, when all peoples of the globe will realize their goals and aspirations and will positively contribute to the process of building, development and innovation. The Acting President from Arabic): I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Alhaji Sule Lamido, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nigeria. (interpretation Mr. Lamido (Nigeria): Please allow me to share with Mr. Holkeri the joy of his election to the presidency of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. He can rest assured of Nigerias support and cooperation. May I also express the same sentiment on behalf of the Group of 77. To his predecessor and my colleague, His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia, Nigeria and the Group of 77 wish to express our pride in and appreciation of the most distinguished manner in which he discharged his duties as the President of the fifty-fourth session. We are indeed very proud of him. May I also commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the manner in which he has piloted 19 and continues to manage the affairs of the United Nations. I would also like to thank him for his millennium report, which has identified some of the pressing problems and challenges facing mankind. the In the past few weeks here at the United Nations a lot of reflection and deep thinking have taken place among world leaders, all in an attempt to more coherently define future. The end of one millennium and the beginning of another warrant all these efforts to find such a purposeful definition. Fifty- five years ago the United Nations was formed as a global bulwark against armed conflict on a world scale, such as the Second World War. Over the years its mandate of preserving international security has broadened from strictly preventing such armed conflict to cover also fundamental issues of socio-economic security for humanity. For example, in many of the developing countries the United Nations manifests its potential more through the United Nations Childrens Fund, the World Health Organization, the United Nations and Cultural Organization and other agencies than in Security Council resolutions, comparatively speaking. It is also from the activities of these United Nations agencies that the underprivileged sectors of poor countries benefit directly, activities from which these same countries, including those in Africa, have come to imbibe the idealism regarding the United Nations ability to harmonize the totality of progress to the benefit of all human stakeholders. Educational, Scientific To a great extent this idealism has not been misplaced. In fact, at no other time has the possibility of a global family been more real than now. This prospect must, I am sure, have been very exciting to so many of us and must have been the basis for hailing the United Nations system for in and contribution these achievements. But as my President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, aptly observed here less than two weeks ago, its own role to “Although the world has generally become a safer place to live in, thanks to the contributions of the United Nations, we must all feel deeply worried that the message of hope which the Organization has been spreading is yet to reach the millions of humankind for whom is intended. For the vast majority of our peoples, grinding poverty has remained a fact of their everyday existence.” () it 20 This reality of grinding poverty has raised considerable apprehension in some United Nations Member States about their fate in the new millennium. There is a clear basis for this apprehension, given that the past millennium was, for most of these countries, characterized by extreme poverty, heavy indebtedness, wars of attrition and the resultant mass ordeal and anguish for both their immediate and distant victims, absolute vulnerability to epidemics such as cholera, malaria and the HIAIDS pandemic, the scourge of natural disasters, serious technological backwardness and a digital divide between the others, and by profound economic decline and infrastructural decay. In the last decade in particular, whatever hopes were raised by some initiatives aimed at mitigating African and third world underdevelopment have dwindled to nothing as the world emerged from the cold war into a more problematic concept called globalization. the rage of them and typhoid, The globe, which is the symbol or logo of the United Nations, depicts humanity. From the word “globe” has been derived a phenomenon called globalization, which explicitly connotes a world without national borders, with particular reference to commerce, in which humanity is one huge market. Apart from thus unfortunately associating the noble and emotive word “humanity” with the materialism of commerce and the market, globalization automatically raises other questions for three quarters of humanity outside the orbit of industrial competence. In a global economy all the actors in that economy should also be stakeholders. But what stake does Africa have in a global economy? Economically, it is heavily indebted, some of its countries committing up to 55 per cent of gross earnings to debt servicing and payment. What can the little that is left do for the domestic economy? What does an economy that produces virtually nothing in industrial terms have to offer, and, moreover, how can it compete in a global economy? What is the income level of the average African, relative to that of his or her counterparts in many countries of the West, vis-a-vis the capacity to patronize the goods and services which globalization offers? How does globalization facilitate democratic consolidation? How can the core values of liberal democracy, such as the rule of law, the preservation of human rights and good governance, be sustained by a Government that lacks the resources to competently provide a minimum of social service delivery and thus sustain legitimacy and regime credibility? In what ways would a typical regime in Africa be able to contribute its quota to democratic consolidation with the debt overhang, the exchange and interest rate practices in the international financial architecture, the prices offered for raw materials relative to the prices of industrial goods and services, the limited trade access and the conditionalities tied to loans and aid? As a responsible member of the international community and as the chair of the G-77, Nigeria is obliged to draw attention to the context of our present situation. What is clear to me now is that the dream of a global family cannot be attained if the present world architecture of power and the reward system continues. The dialogue of the Organization of African Unity, the Non-Aligned Movement and the G-77 with the G-8 countries has so far shown that a great deal can be achieved from that approach to the issues in question. As President Obasanjo again said in a separate speech, it is imperative for the world to seize this moment to begin to get the future right, since such a solemn moment in the history of mankind as the recent Millennium Summit, may not always present itself. We are talking of dialogue that takes the issues on board in a holistic manner, as opposed to the current practice of abstracting merely one or other manifestation of the system — for example, in the case of wars of attrition and the idea of international humanitarian intervention. The debate so far has brought to the fore the problem of the contradiction between sovereignty and intervention. Of course, nation States, even those on the verge of evaporation, would be sensitive to the word “intervention”. But, more than that, discussion of the issue has brought out the one-dimensional nature of the treatment of some issues or problems in terms of what we include in or exclude from the definition. In this particular case, the debate so far has concentrated on war situations or armed conflicts featuring massive loss of life. What of other situations where loss of life is also of a serious magnitude but not as a result of war or armed conflict? What of the silent genocide occasioned by the HIAIDS pandemic, epidemics and natural disasters such as famine, drought, flood, etc.? What about the situation that arises when sanctions lead to deaths on a serious scale? All these should find a place in a proper and systematic discussion of humanitarian intervention aimed at giving succour to those who may be trapped in tragedies other than wars. Similarly, is there no other way by which the world can arrest the proliferation of small arms and light weapons in Africa and other parts of the South? Certainly the world knows about the nature and types of weapons used in the prosecution of these wars, where they are manufactured and by whom, the processes by which they are traded and acquired and the key facilitators of including national governments and arms merchants. What if the search for solutions focused on these areas? these processes, These and many other weighty global issues were discussed at the first ever South Summit held in Havana last April. That Summit was a defining moment for the Group of 77 countries which pondered the challenges of the twenty-first century. In Havana the South resolved to forge a new and meaningful partnership with industrialized nations. We demanded equal partnership in decision-making that affects the whole of humanity. That was the message the leaders of the South took to the G8 Summit in Okinawa. The outcome of that consultation vividly demonstrates that meaningful partnership is a must for the new century. Certainly the interests of mankind compel a more inclusive participation of all segments of our global community. the The Acting President from Arabic): I now give the floor to Mr. Nasser Al-Kidwa, Chairman of the Observer delegation of Palestine. (interpretation to convey the outset allow me Mr. Al-Kidwa (Palestine) (interpretation from Arabic): At to Mr. Holkeri our congratulations on his election as President of this session of the General Assembly, expressing our full confidence in him and wishing him every possible success. This session has special importance for Palestine and we hope that during its proceedings and under his leadership historic steps will be taken in our favour. I should also like to thank His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, President of the fifty-fourth session, a fighter for freedom and a fighter for peace, for his excellent leadership during the course of the past year. I would be remiss if I failed to seize thanks the opportunity to express our special to Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his effective leadership and for his special interest in the situation in the Middle East and the peace process there. As we meet in the wake of the Millennium Summit, it is incumbent upon us to seek to build upon 21 implementing its outcome beginning with the Millennium Declaration and adopting it as a guide for our work in the next era. This should be the case not only with regard to globalization and future social and economic issues, but also with regard to one of the main tasks not fully achieved during the past era (cid:31) the achievement of self-determination by namely, peoples under colonial domination and foreign occupation. That task will not be fully achieved until Israeli occupation comes to an end and the Palestinian in accordance with State has been established international the step necessary to place ourselves side by side with other member States on the road to development, democracy and prosperity and so that we may be allowed to carry our the international community and its future tasks. legitimacy. For us responsibility share of this is small towards As President Yasser Arafat mentioned in his address to the Millennium Summit, the Palestine Central Council met to consider the situation as the agreed date between the Palestinian and Israeli sides for reaching a final status agreement, 13 September 2000, approached; that date was also the deadline of the agreed-upon extension of the five-year interim period that originally ended on 4 May 1999. The Palestine Central Council addressed this situation with a high level of responsibility towards our people and towards the peace process and took a difficult decision seeking a balance between the natural and historic rights of the Palestinian people to their State, based on the partition resolution 181 (II) and in accordance with the Declaration of Independence of 1988 and our right to establish this State at the end of the interim period, on the one hand, and preserving what some have called the last chance for the peace process and for reaching an agreement between the two sides through an additional extension and the decision to continue the negotiations for the next five or six weeks on the other. The Council thus decided to delay the establishment of the State and at the same time mandated the Executive Committee and the presidency of the Palestine National Council and the necessary steps in this regard, including completion of the constitutional declaration and laws for presidential and parliamentary elections, as well as the submission of an application for membership for the State of Palestine in the United Nations, followed by a report on these steps to the Central Council no later than 15 November 2000, the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. the Legislative Council take to 22 the agreement by the Palestinian side That decision means first and foremost our desire and commitment to reach an agreement with the Israeli side if that side is truly ready for that. Secondly, it also means to postpone the establishment of the State, not only until the end of the transitional period and its extension, but until the end of the realistic opportunity for achieving a possible final agreement at the present time. We believe that no one can expect us to go beyond that and accept the continuation of the present transitional situation that is impossible to endure. We further believe that all States, including those that have advised us to postpone, will understand this and will thus be ready to provide the necessary support for our steps, including support for the application of Palestine for membership in the United Nations. The assumption of power by the current Israeli Government was coupled with a chorus of positive voices that led to increased hope for rapid and honest implementation of the agreements signed by the two sides aimed at achieving a final agreement in the agreed time. We honestly wanted to believe this and dealt with that Government positively and with full commitment to the agreements. But the stubborn realities began to impose themselves on the ground, regardless of the wishes and the artificial positive voices. The current Government did not implement any of the provisions of these agreements except those provisions that the former Government had explicitly committed itself to in implementation of the Wye River Memorandum of October 1998. This Government has not carried out one centimetre of redeployment more than Mr. Netanyahu had committed himself to, and it has also failed to carry out the third redeployment. Illegal settlements, which are destructive to the peace process, have continued, even in Jabal Abu Ghneim, which was the reason the General Assembly convened its tenth emergency special session. A number of other illegal measures and practices have also continued, creating a negative and tense climate. Amidst all of that, final status negotiations started and we witnessed Israeli foot-dragging and procrastination that we could not understand and that has led to more doubts and tension. Then came the Camp David Summit, for which thorough preparation was needed before being convened, something that was not accepted by the Israeli the Summit represented a very important opportunity to move into side. Despite everything, a new, serious phase of negotiations through the personal involvement of President Bill Clinton and his Secretary of State and the rest of his team. We highly appreciate all the efforts made for the success of the Summit. For our part, we spared no effort in the same direction. However, we believe that Israels lack of readiness to comply with the terms of reference of the peace process prevented the success of such efforts. It is to absolve the to apply. Israeli side of incorrect because In the wake of the Summit a campaign was launched by some parties and some biased media organizations its responsibility and to place undue pressure on the Palestinian side. For example, some say that the Israeli side progressed from its original positions during the negotiations more than the Palestinian side. That is factually incorrect, in addition to being the wrong yardstick the Palestinian side has progressed from its original position more than the Israeli side, but that happened with the start of the peace process and the acceptance of the bases of such a process. The Palestinian side has accepted, despite the historic injustice, establishing its State in accordance with the partition plan, which gave us less than half of mandated Palestine, and has accepted as the basis for settlement Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which gives us less than a quarter of mandated Palestine. Is there a more momentous concession than this? Is it possible to forget that and only look at positions taken during the Camp David negotiations, regardless of the past? It is also the wrong yardstick to apply because the appropriate yardstick should be the closeness of the sides to the agreed basis of the peace process and their commitment to Security Council resolution 242 (1967), the implementation of which is the goal of the peace process, and not the extent of their movement from original positions, especially if such positions were illegal and irrational. Needless to say, the Palestinian side has fully adhered to this resolution and has never attempted to circumvent it, whereas the Israeli side has never that resolution and aiming to usurp more and more Palestinian land and rights. stopped pursuing positions violating Let us have another look at the positions of the parties on some specific issues, so that all may be aware of the details of the situation. With regard to Jerusalem, the first kiblah and the third of the holy sanctuaries and the cradle of Jesus Christ, the other side claims that it made substantial concessions while towards the whole negotiation, which means the Palestinians did not. It also claims that we have not shown enough sensitivity the holy sites pertaining to Judaism. All of this is incorrect. The signed agreements state that Jerusalem will be an issue for of Jerusalem — occupied East Jerusalem and West Jerusalem, which is under de facto Israeli control. For our part, we have accepted that West Jerusalem shall be under Israeli sovereignty and become the capital of Israel. We have demanded the end of the occupation of East Jerusalem so that it may come under Palestinian sovereignty and be the capital of Palestine. We have accepted that the city shall be open, and have accepted all kinds of guarantees for freedom of conscience, worship and access to all holy places under Palestinian sovereignty. In return for such flexibility, Israel is not satisfied with recognized sovereignty over West Jerusalem, but seeks also to usurp parts of occupied East Jerusalem. With regard to the Jewish holy places, we fully respect their sacredness, and Islam recognizes the three monotheistic religions — Judaism, Christianity and Islam — and all their prophets. Thus, we have shown every possible flexibility, even with regard to those places on lands in occupied East Jerusalem, to which resolution 242 (1967) is applicable. We have accepted that the Western Wall of Al-Haram Al-Sharif, which is known to the Arabs and Muslims as Al-Buraq Wall and to the Israelis and Jews as the Wailing Wall, shall be placed under Israeli control, bearing in mind its sacredness to Judaism and consistent with the situation since the British mandate on Palestine. In return for our flexibility Israel not only seeks sovereignty over the Western Wall, but further challenges our sovereignty over Al-Haram Al-Sharif and seeks to maintain some form of sovereignty over it, something that will not be accepted by any Palestinian, Arab or Muslim leader, not now and not in the future. We have recently taken a major additional step in this regard by indicating our readiness to accept a certain mechanism for ensuring that no excavations are conducted under Al-Haram Al-Sharif, or even our readiness to accept Muslim sovereignty over Al-Haram Al-Sharif through the Al-Quds Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). This represents the utmost that can be done in terms of dealing with an Arab and Muslim trust over Palestinian land. 23 their rights With regard to another important issue, namely, Palestinian refugees and their rights, the Palestinian side has upheld in accordance with international law, like any other refugees in the world, and in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions, in particular resolution 194 (III), including their right to return and to compensation. At the same time, we have shown our readiness to accept specific implementation mechanisms to be agreed upon. In return for our flexibility, Israel refuses to recognize its responsibility for this human tragedy and refuses to recognize the rights of the refugees, including their right to return, and wants only to compensate them, and even that at the expense of others and not in its capacity as the party that seized their lands and properties. Yesterday the Assembly heard Israels spokesman repeat what has been said, attempting not only to deny Israels responsibility but also denying the individual property of the refugees, more than 5.5 million dunams of land, legal and full property of individuals. The Acting Foreign Minister attempted to put an end to that in an address to the Assembly. The third important issue is that of settlements and borders. We have affirmed that settlements are illegal and must not be built on Palestinian lands. Furthermore, Israel must withdraw to the armistice lines of 1949, which are commonly known as the lines of 4 June 1967. At the same time, and in order to resolve some of the demographic problems illegally created by Israel, we have shown our readiness to accept changes in the border lines on the basis of full reciprocity. In return for such flexibility, Israel still attempts to appropriate more land and to annex other parts of occupied Palestinian territory. However, we generally feel, or at least hope, that the differences on this and the remaining issues are less sharp than the differences I indicated regarding the two previous ones, and it is hoped this might signify a real change in the Israeli position regarding all issues. We have not lost hope yet. We are still committed to the peace process and to serious and continuous negotiations in the coming weeks. Yet this morning we were surprised to hear the spokesman of the Israeli Government announce the negotiations are suspended. We hope that the Israeli positions are tactical and that the Israeli side will in the final analysis respect its commitment to the bases of the peace process. We want an agreement, an agreement that will remove us from the cycle of confrontation and that 24 that will carry forward both sides, and the entire region and its future generations, to a new era. Such an agreement must be balanced, reasonable and based on international law, the basis of the peace process. This requires a continuation of the necessary efforts and unbiased support of the two cosponsors of the peace process, particularly the United States of America, other concerned parties in the region, the European Union and interested parties throughout the world. We are ready and look forward to such a historic agreement between the two States, Palestine and Israel. that it comes the United Nations During the Millennium Summit much was said about the United Nations and its past and future role. We wish to add is indispensable when the question of Palestine and the situation in the Middle East. We have always emphasized the permanent responsibility of the United Nations for the question of Palestine until it is effectively resolved in all its aspects, and while we always called for more United Nations involvement in the Middle East peace process, others have attempted to exclude and neutralize it. We are convinced that in the coming decisive period the role of the United Nations will become more important, no matter what the circumstances. If we were, God forbid, to arrive at a dead end despite all our strenuous efforts for the success of the peace process, then we would come to the United Nations and expect to receive its protection and support. We will work to obtain membership and to contribute to the resolutions of the United Nations, the established committees and the relevant programmes so that all might provide an additional boost for the achievement of our peoples rights, including their right to the establishment of their independent State with Jerusalem as its capital, after such a long period of trial and tribulation. to legitimate If our hope is fulfilled and we are successful in reaching a final agreement with our neighbours, then we expect that the need for the United Nations and its organs will be greater. The United Nations responsibility in all its forms will continue until the end of the implementation period and there will be a need to legitimize some aspects of the agreement and perhaps to complement them. There will also be a need for United Nations the implementation period with regard to many aspects, in particular with regard to Palestinian refugees, including the continuation of the work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the assistance during then propose the specific Near East. We will reactivation of the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine, which was established by resolution 194 (III) and is composed of the United States, France and Turkey, and the use of the records of the Commission related to land ownership in Palestine. These records were updated by the United Nations Secretariat, in cooperation with the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, and can now be used. In any case, the need for the United Nations will increase, and we call for preparedness for that eventuality. that must be There are other aspects of resolved the Arab-Israeli conflict in order for a comprehensive peace to be achieved in the region. In this context, we reaffirm the necessity of reactivating the Syrian-Israeli track of the peace process as well as the need for Israel to accept the principle of full withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Arab Golan to the lines of 4 June 1967. We declare our solidarity with our sister country, Syria, and support its just demands, including Israeli adherence to the terms of reference of the peace process. We also express our great happiness at the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon. We congratulate the brotherly Lebanese people on the liberation of their territories and support their other demands regarding the achievement of peace between Lebanon and Israel. In this context, we affirm our agreement with regard to rejecting the resettlement of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and the need for them to return to their homes, and, until then, we expect them to benefit from normal living conditions. With regard to Arab national security and the principle of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, we reaffirm the need for Israel to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and to put all its nuclear facilities under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. We also support attempts aimed at establishing a region free from weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East and believe this to be an essential condition for establishing a new reality in the region, which we all seek to achieve. In the context of the wider Arab region, the suffering of the brotherly Iraqi people is still a source of real concern for us all. We call for a speedy end to their suffering. We also call for the total lifting of sanctions imposed on sisterly Libya and brotherly Sudan. We also call for the peaceful settlement of the issue of the three islands between the United Arab Emirates and Iran in a way that preserves the rights of the United Arab Emirates in these islands. We also express our happiness for the recent steps taken in Somalia and express our hope that the stability and reconciliation process will continue. We reaffirm the need for efforts to be made to resolve problems everywhere, including, inter alia, those of Cyprus, of the great African continent, particularly the Horn of Africa, of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of some of the surrounding countries. The resolution of such problems will represent an important contribution towards placing to development and progress. that continent on the road to fraternal Arab countries, Before concluding I must once again express our deep thanks to our brothers and friends everywhere, particularly Islamic countries and non-aligned countries, as well as to all other friends for their principled and continuous support. Let this year be the year that will bring to an end the historical injustice that has befallen our people, and let it be the beginning of a new life in the Middle East for all States, peoples and future generations"}}
