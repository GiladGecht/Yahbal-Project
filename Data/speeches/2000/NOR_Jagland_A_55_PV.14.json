{"speech":{"0":" First of all, I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of your important position. I would also like to welcome Tuvalu as a new Member of the United Nations. have served Norway is committed to a strong and effective United Nations. For decades, we have pursued a policy of translating our commitment to the United Nations into substantial contributions to the various activities of the United Nations system. That is why some 60,000 Norwegians in United Nations peacekeeping operations. That is why Norway today contributes 1,500 military and civilian personnel to United Nations and United Nations-mandated peacekeeping operations around the world. That is why we are supporting the peace and reconciliation efforts of the United Nations in the Middle East, Colombia, Cyprus and Sudan. And that is why a relatively small country of 4.5 million inhabitants is one of the largest donors of voluntary contributions to the economic, social and humanitarian programmes of the United Nations. This year, Norway is providing $1.3 billion dollars for development cooperation. My Government plans to increase that amount substantially over the next few years. A large part of that will be channelled through the United Nations system. At the first session of the General Assembly in the twenty-first century, and after the successful Millennium Assembly last week, it is time to take stock and act upon the decisions we have made. Here is what Norway will give priority to in the time ahead. We will focus on the root causes of conflict and put the fight against poverty, underdevelopment and environmental degradation at the top of our agenda. Financing for development is essential. Norway reached the 0.7 per cent target more than 20 years ago. We are currently devoting 0.9 per cent of our gross national product for official development assistance, and my Government has pledged to reach a full one per cent. We will increase our support multilateral development agencies, through the including our 5 support to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). to continue advocate We will a more comprehensive approach to peace-building. Conflict prevention, long-term development cannot be regarded as separate tasks. They must be part of an integrated and coherent strategy of human security. humanitarian relief and We will continue to combat malaria, tuberculosis and other diseases. Malaria alone takes two lives every minute of every day of every year, mainly those of children and pregnant women. We will significantly increase our contribution to the vaccination of children, so that they do not die of easily curable diseases. We will intensify our efforts to help contain and reduce the spread of HIAIDS, which in many countries has become the single largest threat to development. We will focus even more strongly on Africa, as Africa needs a new and better deal. We call for a renewed commitment to Africa and are prepared to contribute substantially to this effort. The United Nations has mounted more peace operations during the last 10 years than during the previous four decades combined. We have witnessed significant successes, but also uncovered disturbing and tragic weaknesses. Far too often (cid:151) and frequently at great cost to the people we were supposed to protect (cid:151) the United Nations has relied on last-minute efforts and ad hoc arrangements. The rich and powerful Member States must honour their promises to the weak and defenceless. Norway supports the recommendations in the report of the United Nations Panel on Peace Operations, headed by Ambassador Brahimi. We stand ready to engage in a broad dialogue on how to ensure the speedy and efficient the implementation of recommendations contained in the Brahimi report. Together with our partners, we will push forward towards non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We will work for further reductions in nuclear arsenals with a view to eliminating them, building on the important results of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) Review Conference here in New York. We will continue to combat illicit trade and the spread of small arms. We should make full use of the the United Nations opportunity provided by 6 Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects to take firm steps to curtail this deadly traffic. None of this can be done, however, if we do not secure a sound financial basis for the United Nations itself. We must put United Nations finances on a more secure and predictable footing. We must close the gap between the tasks we ask the United Nations to carry out and the resources we make available to it. Zero growth is clearly not sufficient. We cannot expect the United Nations to carry out new and additional tasks without additional funding. No one must be allowed to commit war crimes or crimes against humanity with impunity. Norway therefore strongly supports the Statute establishing an International Criminal Court. Now we must seek its speedy implementation. To effectively meet our common challenges, we the United must build new partnerships between Nations, civil society and the private sector. The (cid:147)Global Compact(cid:148) is one such initiative. The (cid:147)Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization(cid:148) (GAVI) is another. Early next year Norway will host an international conference in Oslo on the role of the private sector in promoting investment and economic development in the least developed countries. We will continue to support efforts to enable developing countries to take full advantage of the benefits of multilateral cooperation. In particular, we would like to assist the least developed countries (cid:151) including small island developing States (cid:151) to benefit more fully from joint international efforts, including the legal regime for the seas and oceans established by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. provides opportunities it can also Globalization for unprecedented growth, but to marginalization and isolation. In our globalized world, markets have become global much faster than politics. There is an urgent need to adapt the international trading and financial systems so that every country can obtain its fair share of the benefits of globalization. lead In our shrinking world, providing humanitarian aid and emergency relief to people in need is the responsibility of every Government. Norway will increase its humanitarian efforts (cid:151) which are already among the most intensive in the world (cid:151) both bilaterally and through United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations. We will to the best of our ability continue to facilitate peace efforts in countries where the parties to a conflict involvement. Ultimately, however, the responsibility for lasting peace rests with the parties themselves. request our Finally, we reiterate our call for reform and enlargement of the Security Council in terms of both permanent and non-permanent members. Broader membership and increased transparency are essential to the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Council. For the first time since 1979, Norway is seeking a seat on the Security Council. We hope to be elected, after 22 years, based on our contributions to the United Nations and on the principles of fair rotation. We therefore ask for the support of the Assembly. Norway will deeply respect a mandate from the Assembly. We will be attentive to its voices and concerns. We will remain committed to help those who suffer from poverty and war, disasters and famine to place a strong United Nations at the centre of world affairs, to ensure that those who have the strongest backs bear the heaviest burden. We ask the Assembly to allow us to serve all Members. "}}
