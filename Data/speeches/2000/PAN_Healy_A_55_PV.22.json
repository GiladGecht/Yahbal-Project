{"speech":{"0":" Allow me to convey to you, Mr. President, the warm congratulations of Her Excellency, Mireya Moscoso, President of the Republic of Panama, together with those of her Government and the people of my country, on your election to serve as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session. Your designation to guide the debates in this forum is highly gratifying to the Panamanian delegation, not only because of your own brilliant political record and your well-known devotion to the well-being of the Finnish people, but also because of the noble way in which you here represent the lofty ideals of sovereignty and universal cooperation in pursuit of world peace, sustainable human development, human rights, democracy and justice — traditional mainstays of Finlands foreign policy and of the activities of the United Nations. Panama shares with so many other States Members of the Organization your concern to put these ideals into practice, and that is what I shall be addressing today in my statement. I am also glad to pay tribute to, and express my gratitude for, the activities of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who has devoted particular effort in the last year to the maintenance of international peace and security, the reform of the Organization, and the promotion of human rights, gender equality and the enjoyment of the rights of the child. Panama shares these and other concerns of the Secretary-General. Indeed, as the other members of the Ibero-American community are aware, upon an initiative of President Mireya Moscoso announced at Havana in November last year, the next Summit of Heads of State and Government of Ibero-America, which will take place shortly in Panama, will be dedicated to discussing the problems facing children and young people in our region. In the preparations for this meeting, which Panama has undertaken with the greatest enthusiasm, the national Government has received the support of organizations devoted to the well-being of the worlds children and young people. These include the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) — a United Nations agency which has selected Panama as its new regional headquarters and to whose noteworthy activities, in fulfilment of its mandate, I am glad to pay tribute on this occasion — together with agencies responsible for promoting culture, particularly the culture of peace, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), another United Nations agency which has done extremely valuable work in promoting universal understanding technology and communication. through education, including Indeed, With respect to gender equality, we are glad to be able to state that in recent years our country has made significant progress, particularly with respect to the political participation of women. since 1 September last year a woman has guided the destiny of our nation. From January this year our Supreme Court of Justice has been presided over by a woman. During the review conference on women held in the context of the special session of the General Assembly in June 2000, the delegation of Panama signed the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which makes it possible to have recourse to an international body in case of the denial of such rights. Furthermore, Panama has made significant improvements in access for women to education and health. However, much still remains to be done, particularly with respect to equal access to economic resources. In this area, which is sustainable human development, my country hopes to make significant closely bound up with advances, cooperation. particularly through international On this point, international cooperation, I should like to share some brief thoughts and place them before this distinguished body for consideration. More than 40 years ago one of my predecessors in the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Miguel J. Moreno, addressed this General Assembly on the topic of international cooperation for development. On that occasion Minister Moreno stated: the of and development, for international “Economic cooperation such development, are not only necessary if world peace is to be achieved, but also represent important means of cementing it and making it durable.” (9, para. 176) attainment Dr. Moreno added: international harmony; all for world peace.” “Social tranquillity and national political stability depend on economic development and on the benefits which the peoples derive therefrom, as do also a better understanding among the nations these and are (9, indispensable para. 178) These wise words are as true today as they were when they were uttered at the thirteenth session of the General Assembly in 1958. It is this wisdom that has guided the renewed emphasis that the United Nations, in the last decade and through its United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), has placed on the promotion of sustainable human development. This concept is the axis and basis of our Presidents governmental plan. Our Government recognizes that without measures to promote human development, economic growth can make no sense and have no meaning. Although it may be boosted by economic growth, human development is much more than economic growth, for human development means enhancing the capacities of human beings as individuals and as members of the community by measures that provide access to emancipating education and to better health and transport services, measures to permit participation in an economy and a culture that respects human dignity, that encourage the prudent use of natural resources, and foster and enlarge the exercise of the 7 and nature this multidimensional the Panamanian delegation expresses fundamental duties and rights of the human individual. Given the Panamanian Governments concern to work towards sustainable human development and to promote human rights, its satisfaction at the contents of the latest UNDP human development report, which considers the link between human rights and human development. The report explains that human freedom is the common purpose and the common motivation of human rights and human development. to assist us in promoting Mr. Aboulhasan (Kuwait), Vice-President, took the Chair. In the years that have elapsed since our return to constitutional government our country has made significant advances. Under our Government we have begun a process of repealing legislation that restricts freedom of expression and we have invited the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights, a significant regional agency, the enjoyment of human rights in Panama. Also recently, through a process of cooperation involving the major political movements in the country, we have adopted by consensus the basic elements of a Panamanian the doctrine of human security policy based on security, an extremely important component of sustainable human development. That doctrine upholds individual and grass-roots communities as constant, clear-cut points of reference for the responsibilities and purposes of the States security strategy, and is based on taking preventive measures designed to reduce vulnerabilities and minimize the risks threatening the opportunities and individuals and of communities. I am particularly gratified to be able to state that Panama is one of the few countries to have adopted the human security doctrine as a State policy. We hope that this will be a matter for more in-depth discussion and analysis at the next Summit of the Americas to be held in June 2001 in Quebec, Canada. rights of In the context of this and other aspects of sustainable human development and the exercise of human rights, Panama firmly believes in international cooperation and has recourse to it in order to promote the lofty objectives that are the inspiration for States Members of the recent Millennium Summit, whose purpose was to set a clear course for the United Nations in the twenty-first century, Panama, among other things, called for States Members to return to the pursuit of the original spirit the United Nations. At 8 of the Charter of the United Nations. Pursuant to this request, it is our hope that the members of the Security Council will assume the obligation of representing the general interests of the international community instead of acting according to their individual strategic military or political interests. The general interest of the Members of the Organization indicates that the time has come in debate and reach some conclusion as to the way in which we can expand the number of permanent and non-permanent members of the Security Council while restricting and regulating the use of the veto. We have expressed our agreement with the need to reform the Charter of the United Nations in order to achieve this objective and others, provided such reform is based on the principles of democracy and equitable geographic participation. to engage Panama wishes here and now to reaffirm its commitment to the principle of self-determination of peoples, articulated in the Charter of the United Nations, and to the use of mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of conflicts. The dangerous disputes which riddle and split our world from the China Sea to the Magreb, and which may degenerate into domestic or transboundary outbreaks of violence, must be addressed with a sense of urgency by the United Nations. This would be possible within a structured, conflict-prevention programme for specialized support to nations to guide them and assist them in a fair and orderly, peaceful negotiation of their interests. Accordingly, we recommend recourse to the moral and technical presence of the United Nations within such processes, engaged in by small States beset by hostile Powers, or by religious intolerances. Likewise, we recommend recourse to the United Nations support of negotiations on reunification or self-determination that other people may wish to embark upon, with the aim of preserving a prosperous, democratic way of life or of securing for themselves the benefits of development. that provided racial or in The Republic of Panama nowadays is a fully sovereign State glad to have recovered the exercise of sovereignty throughout its national territory, and to have proved its resolve and ability to fulfil the commitments stemming from its participation in this great international community. Panama has the will and the capacity not only to administer efficiently and transparently its greatest asset, the Panama Canal, but also to cope successfully with the growing demands for international maritime traffic and to ensure the security of our inter-oceanic waterway. force behind the development of The Canal and the reverted lands will be the driving the Panamanian economy in coming years. Among other large-scale projects, we are now executing the extension of the Culebra Cut, a $1 billion investment that, once completed in the year 2001, will permit simultaneous passage of Panamax vessels through this section of the Canal. Once this work is completed, projects will be begun to expand the Canals water basin. Moreover, consultations and studies are under way with a view to building the third set of locks, which will make it possible for the inter-oceanic waterway to be used by post-Panamax vessels and will increase the efficiency of the Canal by 25 per cent. All this will benefit world trade. Lastly, in the coming year bidding will be opened for the construction of a second bridge over the Canal in order to help unite our land, which is currently divided by the Canal. In the lands recovered and now devoted to national development, former military installations of all kinds have been expertly retooled for commercial civilian use. Among other things, the former Albrook air base has become a centre for domestic air and land transport; the former School of the Americas has been converted into a hotel of the Melia international chain, with its own convention centre; the Coco Solo military base, which enjoys a unique location at the Atlantic mouth of the Canal, today houses the international maritime cargo ports of Manzanillo and Coco Solo, which complement the international port of Balboa on the Pacific, all interconnected by a trans-isthmus rail system for container transport; and in the forts of Davis, Corozal and Cocoli, processing centres are now being developed for exports, with the backing of international capital. With input from the International Financial Corporation, studies are being undertaken to convert the Howard air base into a multifunctional air and sea cargo centre for the Pacific side of the Canal. The development of the Sherman base, which is a genuine ecological gem, seeks to link the protection of the countrys historical patrimony and environment with economic development. Fort Clayton is now the base of an educational and industrial complex known as the City of Knowledge, where the regional office of the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) for the hemisphere will be located. The City of Knowledge is also home to regional campuses of Texas A & M and McGill Universities and a continental-level regional centre for human rights. All of this will contribute to the Governments plan to make Panama a centre of international agencies. its links with In order to take full advantage of international cooperation, Panama has adopted a policy of strengthening the various major international organizations, including those that are part of the United Nations system. In this way we are striving to move forward and contribute to worldwide peacemaking by converting former military bases into civilian and commercial areas that will enhance world peace. for Economic Cooperation This is an appropriate occasion to place on record that Panama categorically rejects the actions of the Organisation and Development (OECD), which has unilaterally devised taxation standards that its members are trying to impose outside their jurisdiction, in open violation of resolutions of the General Assembly. On this point, Panama is grateful for the support of the majority leader of the United States House of Representatives, who on 7 September wrote to the United States Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Lawrence Summers, strongly condemning this action. There is a need for a careful examination of the flight of billions of dollars in capital from developing countries to the financial institutions of the first world which are trying to tighten the so-called qualifications that are used to exert pressure, with obvious objectives. Panama is committed to the fight against the laundering of money stemming from drug trafficking and other unlawful activities. We believe that all countries should work this scourge. This effort should be carried out through legitimate mechanisms of international institutions that are representative not only of the industrialized North but also of the emerging countries of the South, such as the United Nations regional organizations. to eliminate the various together and In the spirit of international cooperation, to which I previously referred, and in consideration of the most basic concepts of justice, we are today calling for the cooperation of the General Assembly in resolving a dispute between Panama and the United States of America, as a result of the bases operated by the armed forces of that country on our territory throughout the 9 last century. In this forum, in September last year, our President stressed her confidence that the outstanding differences surrounding this issue that still persisted between Panama and the United States would be resolved satisfactorily in a reasonable period of time. the efforts and goodwill Unfortunately, despite displayed by these differences have still not been settled. the Panamanian Government In his powerful report entitled “We the peoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century”, and with respect to certain matters relating to trade, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, proposes that States Members follow a line of conduct consonant with environmental and human rights standards. He also urges States to fulfil their obligations vis-a-vis universal values and the common standards that have emerged from countless conferences and extensive negotiations and that have taken the form of historic resolutions and conventions under the auspices of the United Nations. By extension, we believe that this appeal to States applies not only to trading matters but also to all the other aspects of relationships among nations. His profound words express the vast ethical foundation of the United Nations. In another part of his report the Secretary-General warns of the risk that environmental degradation, among other factors, may heighten social and political tensions in an unforeseeable and potentially dangerous fashion. We are particularly gratified by this clear vision on an issue whose various facets are already having a serious impact not only on many developing nations but also on the most developed. In view of these very wise appeals and warnings, as well as of the predominant role that the United Nations plays in the maintenance of international peace and defence of the principle of sovereignty, in a formal note, to the Secretary-General I have requested him to bring to the attention of the United Nations the failure of the United States of America to fulfil its obligations so that the Organization can assist in bringing about an early resolution of the dispute arising from the refusal of the United States to fulfil the commitments derived from the unauthorized military use by its army of significant portions of Panamas national territory. I have informed the Secretary-General of the facts and formally requested that my note be circulated as a document of the General Assembly and that it be brought to the attention of the Security Council. 10 I take this opportunity to wish the General Assembly a fruitful year of deliberations under the guidance of its President. I should like to express my sincere hope that this year will be one of significant, meaningful the Organization in the treatment of the most important items on its agenda, to the benefit of all mankind. (interpretation from Arabic): I now call on His Excellency Mr. Alwi Shihab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia. The Acting President achievements tangible and for Mr. Shihab (Indonesia): It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Mr. Holkeri on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty- fifth session. I am confident that under his most able guidance we will make substantive progress in our deliberations. I also pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, the esteemed Foreign Minister of Namibia, for the skilful manner in which he guided our work during a busy year. I also take this opportunity to commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his report on the work of the Organization. I also take this occasion to welcome the new Member, Tuvalu, to our midst. strongly reaffirming The fifty-fifth session opened with the historic Millennium Summit and the adoption of a visionary Declaration offering the cardinal principles that should govern relations among nations. It charted a course that, if followed, will ensure durable peace and security as well as common progress and prosperity for all humanity. It, hopefully, began a new chapter in the history of the United Nations. Undeniably, expectations are raised that the Organization will overcome the pervasive and interrelated obstacles to peace and development, while and preserving the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. We know that these goals can be achieved, but it is crucial that Member States, civil society, international organizations and the private sector cooperate and work together for that purpose. supported by the empowerment of the Organization, entailing more than charting a new structure and new mechanisms, or providing a willingness and legitimacy to the United Nations by setting new norms and agendas as needed. It also urgently calls for reform of the Security Council. New prospects for that effort may have emerged in the joint statement of the Heads These efforts must be resources. additional authority demands to provide genuine It of State or Government of the permanent members of the Council on 7 September. In that statement they pledged to foster a more transparent and broadly representative Council to enhance its effectiveness for peace and security. One major issue confronting us is the lack of progress on the elimination of nuclear weapons. We are even more concerned to see a new rationalization for their continued use, coupled with repeated assertions of their legitimacy and necessity, and to see the danger of the deployment of anti-ballistic missile defence systems. This lack of progress increases the prospects of a new nuclear arms race which will threaten the existing arms control agreements and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Ridding the world of the dangers posed by nuclear weapons, pending their total abolition, is the greatest challenge of our time. In anticipating In contributing to peace and security, Indonesia has since 1957 actively participated in and contributed to the various peacekeeping operations of the United Nations. the new and emerging problems identified by the Secretary-General and, in particular, the report () of the Brahimi panel, we are in the process of responding to the new requirements with a view to bolstering the numbers, quality and effectiveness of our participation in future United Nations missions. the for leaders Palestinian Armed conflict and tensions persist in many parts of the world. In the Middle East we must continue to focus our attention on the core of the conflict, namely, the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people to secure their inalienable rights to self-determination and sovereign statehood in their own homeland, with Jerusalem as its capital. In this context, my delegation commends their statesmanlike approach. They have demonstrated their commitment to peace through the decision to share the city of Jerusalem, while remaining committed to their national rights, in order to reach a compromise. Hence, it behoves Israel to make a similar compromise so that a final settlement can be achieved. The withdrawal of Israel last June from southern Lebanon, following more than two decades of occupation, has finally restored the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon within its boundaries. My delegation also hopes for a resumption of the Israeli- Syrian peace talks, based on the Madrid peace formula. internationally recognized In various regions of the world, however, we see many positive developments which reflect a new spirit of cooperation and compromise. These are exemplified by, among other things, the summit meeting of the two leaders of North and South Korea, the formation of a new Government the ceasefire agreement between Eritrea and Ethiopia. It is my delegations expectation the same spirit of cooperation and compromise will prevail in easing the impact of sanctions on the people of Iraq. It is also an imperative on humanitarian grounds to address the issue of missing persons of the parties concerned during the Gulf war. in Somalia, and that In the afterglow of the Millennium Summit and the first South Summit, which took place in August in Havana, there was a distinct sense of optimism that the enormous power and promise of globalization and the information revolution could be harnessed in the service of development and in combating poverty. In this regard, the declarations and programmes of action provide us with an excellent blueprint for charting the path ahead. Today, particularly in the developing countries, millions remain untouched by the benefits of globalization and the information revolution and, being bypassed and marginalized, can greatly provoke instability. Thus, rather than enjoying generalized peace and prosperity, the world at the turn of the century continues to be disfigured by ruthless conflicts, wrenching poverty, blatant inequalities and problems including hunger, illiteracy and disease. While declarations and programmes of action are of critical importance their implementation is the key. I am convinced that there can be no alternative to productive dialogue to achieve this aim; such dialogue must be based on mutual interests and benefits, shared responsibility and genuine partnership. changing reality, this for One of the core issues of development on which globalization has had a great impact and which requires such dialogue is that of financing for development, an issue that has assumed immense importance in the new global economy. While enormous financial flows have characterized the global financial system, the basic problem for the majority of developing countries is that they are not in a position to benefit from such flows and must instead depend on official development assistance, which has sharply declined. Hence the importance of the forthcoming international high-level 11 event on financing for development that is to be held in 2001. Another area in which globalization has had a great impact, one closely associated with financing for development, is the issue of the indebtedness of the developing countries which often seriously undermines their development efforts, particularly in this era of globalization. Regrettably, the numerous debt strategies and initiatives employed over the years have failed to resolve this problem. in the technologies Equally important in this age of information is the need to harness the potential of the information and communication service of development. Progress was made in placing this critical issue on the agenda of the United Nations when for the first time the high-level segment of the Economic and Social Council this year considered information and communication technologies (ICT) for development as the its major ministerial critical importance of unlocking the vast potential of information and communication technologies for all humanity. theme. The outcome, particularly declaration, underlined the than More strive ever before, due for largely to globalization, we must sustainable development as set out in Agenda 21, adopted in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The outcome of that Conference committed the international community to meet the economic needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of the planet to provide for the needs of future generations. But almost a decade later, with the exception of a number of conventions that have been enacted, relatively little has been achieved in fully implementing Agenda 21, known as Rio+10. It is therefore important that we seriously prepare for the ten-year review of its implementation. In doing so we should be able to generate the highest political commitment the full implementation of the Agenda. In this regard, I am pleased to inform the Assembly that Indonesias offer to host Rio+10 has been strongly supported by the Ministerial Conference and Development of Asia and the Pacific. Environment to ensure to help on the Copenhagen conference on Only a short time ago the five-year reviews were held on social development and the Beijing conference on women. From those two special sessions we learned valuable lessons. We learned that for many people social 12 development remains an elusive goal and that only through gender equality and womens empowerment can true prosperity be achieved. Clearly the time has come to move beyond rhetoric and fully implement the commitments of the various international conferences of the 1990s. We must also work towards eradicating ethnic and racial discrimination, religious intolerance and xenophobia, which threaten to undermine all progress — political, economic forthcoming World Conference against Racism in 2001 therefore presents an opportunity that must be seized. social. The and We are committed to ensuring that humanitarian assistance is available wherever and whenever needed throughout the world. The plight of refugees and displaced persons must continue to hold a prominent position on the global agenda, with each nation meeting its responsibilities to render aid and assistance in times of natural disaster, civil conflict or other emergency situations. We must work also to ensure the integrity of humanitarian missions. The murder of staff of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Atambua, West Timor, has shocked and saddened the world, and nowhere more than Indonesia. That humanitarian workers should become victims in the performance of their work is unacceptable. Let me be clear in stating that this crime should not go unpunished. The necessary measures must be taken to ensure that such a heinous crime is never again tragedy should not, however, result in a withdrawal of humanitarian assistance, thus compounding the loss. We should work together to resolve any and all obstacles to the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance. repeated. This International cooperation in the millennium is unavoidable and indispensable. The quality, extent and timeliness of such cooperation will make the difference between despair and progress. In this setting, the significance of the United Nations should be evident and accepted. Preserving the role of the Organization requires the participation of all Member States, large and small. Beyond declarations, it is time to translate our ideas into action. Achievement is required in the twenty-first century. That was the message of the Millennium Summit. "}}
