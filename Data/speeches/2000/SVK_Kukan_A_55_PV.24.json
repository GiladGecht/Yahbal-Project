{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, I would like to warmly congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. I am confident that your vast experience and outstanding record of achievements will guarantee the best results for this session. I wish you every success in this crucial role. I would also like to extend my thanks to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Namibia, for the productive way in which he managed the affairs of the fifty-fourth session. I also welcome Tuvalu as the new Member of our Organization. however, it definitely the most is definitely Globalization typical phenomenon of the upcoming turn of the millennium. It is frequently criticized and at other times is accepted brings uncritically; unprecedented progress and, at time, problems and challenges. The economic boom also has another aspect in the form of large social differences. The environment often suffers from the industrial boom. Due to new communication technologies, direct human contact is forgotten. I could continue in this vein. the same are beginning The world community also has to face other problems, which a transregional nature — for instance, organized crime, terrorism and emerging armed conflicts. Who is better prepared to tackle all this than the United Nations — the most global institution we have. to display to a greater extent. Moreover, In my view, the Millennium Summit was the most significant step on this very demanding road. It spelled progress when compared with similar meetings in the past, as this time it dealt with the urgent problems of civilization the Millennium Summit managed to draw the attention of the whole world to problems which the United Nations considers to be of the greatest importance. However, to make progress, a to be done. Therefore, I will take the liberty of commencing my contribution precisely with the topic of the reform of the United Nations. lot still remains The report of the Secretary-General, “We the Peoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty- first century” () displays great promise in this direction. The United Nations reform process must continue. The key point is the reform of the Security Council. The positions and the opinions of Member States on issues of Security Council reform — the increase in the number of permanent and non-permanent members and the issue of the veto right — unfortunately still vary greatly, making it very difficult to achieve a substantive outcome in the near future. The results of the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the crucial the work This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of speeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room C-178. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum. (E) ````````` the Security Council and Other Matters related to the Security Council for the past seven years are not encouraging. Despite this, Slovakia will support the renewal of the Working Groups mandate for the fifty- fifth session of the General Assembly. We consider next years session of the Working Group to be crucial for the further advancement of the reform process within this forum. Slovakia has already presented its position regarding to the key issues of Security Council reform. We support strengthening its representative character, effectiveness and transparency of the decision-making process and working methods. With regard to the enlargement of the Council, we consider the increase in the number of members in both categories to be justified. However, in our view, the number of members in both categories does not have to necessarily increase simultaneously. The failure to reach an agreement on one category should not prevent the eventual conclusion of an agreement on the enlargement of the other. The total number of members should not exceed 25, in order not to jeopardize the Councils effectiveness and flexibility in immediately reacting to crisis situations. The Group of Eastern European States, whose membership has more than doubled over the past years, should not be omitted from the enlargement of the Security Council. responsibility Since its founding, the United Nations, as the worlds universal organization, has under the Charter for maintaining assumed primary international peace concept continues to be fundamental to the United Nations and is reinforced every time an international development necessitates a call for rapid peacekeeping response. to our community security. This and from including approaches, operations — The evolution in the nature of United Nations peacekeeping performing traditional military functions to the greater need for multidisciplinary interim administration and post-conflict peace-building — along with the significant expansion of regional and international conflicts worldwide and the growing demand for the involvement of the United Nations in their prevention and settlement, puts the United Nations potential in this vital area to a challenging test. The need for peacekeeping has never been greater. However, such international assistance can be effective only if it is based on peacekeeping operations well 2 suited to dealing with all the problems and the needs of the situation to which it is deployed. Therefore, we welcome the report of the expert Panel on United Nations Peace Operations, which we consider to be an important step toward a meaningful reform of United Nations peacekeeping activities. The Brahimi report () presents a serious challenge to various actors involved in meeting the requirements of todays peacekeeping operations. that in good intentions One should agree, and recent experience has deploying confirmed, peacekeeping operations must be supported by clearly defined and achievable mandates. Only an adequate mandate and appropriate resources, both human and financial, can bring success to and strengthen the credibility of the United Nations in its peacekeeping efforts, and not cause more problems. It requires an appropriate and responsible approach by key players, including the Security Council, Member States and the United Nations Secretariat, in acting promptly on their own, as well as effective cooperation to give a rapid and decisive response to conflict situations. and achieved streamlining improvements must be the Apart from the reform of the Security Council, in qualitative modernizing responsible departmental units in the Secretariat to enhance their efficiency and the effectiveness of their output as much as possible. At the same time, Member States must support the ability of the Secretariat to carry out the tasks we ask it to do, since its ability to act depends on the will of Member States to contribute troops and other assistance to potential peacekeeping operations. should provide Member States adequately prepared troops who are able to fulfil the tasks assigned. Simultaneously, peacekeeping operations should, from the very beginning, be provided with adequate financial resources to support the wide array of mandates. It is therefore equally important to ensure that the financial system providing the funding for United Nations peacekeeping is stable, equitable and transparent and that there is a flexible mechanism in place with the ability to stabilize finances for current and future peacekeeping operations. The revision of the United Nations peacekeeping scale of assessment over the next few months will provide a genuine opportunity for the General Assembly to take a critical look at the current method of assessment and, with the emerging consensus of Member States, to take important steps to find a viable solution to this pressing issue. should provide us with clear strategies on how to cope with the issue in its complexity. I am pleased to announce today our strong support structure of peacekeeping and our readiness to meet our financial commitment under a reformed peacekeeping scale. financial revising the for We would like to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General for his significant role in the process of United Nations reforms. We welcome his commitment to implement the changes recommended in the Brahimi report for which he is responsible. We should do our part and continue our personnel, material and financial support to United Nations peacekeeping missions. Slovakia has traditionally been participating in peacekeeping operations and, as part of its latest activities, is ready to send an engineering unit to the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea authorized by the Security Council last Friday. Due to the geopolitical position of Slovakia, we closely follow the situation in the Balkans. We are aware that problems can only be effectively addressed, and crises and tension in the region eliminated, when all the countries concerned are maximally involved; when they are willing to collaborate to search for compromises, and are prepared to overlook historical to developing relations feuds with a view in a complicated region, from both an ethnic and nationalistic perspective. We hope that the elections in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will be held in a peaceful atmosphere, and that neither of the parties will resort to violence. It is necessary that the elections abide by the rule of law, and that they be democratic, free and fair. Otherwise, it will be difficult to achieve the basic objective: the stabilization of the situation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and in the region as a whole. In the area of disarmament, we welcome the consensus achieved at the sixth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which confirmed commitments to the provisions of the Treaty and its strengthened review process. This positive impulse needs to be efficiently utilized in the process of further implementation of the Treaty. We also welcome the ongoing preparatory process for the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects in 2001. The outcome of the Conference Slovakia fully supports respect for the norms of international law and the execution of international treaties in good faith, in compliance with the principle of pacta sunt servanda. The harmonization of traditional theories based on the principle of State sovereignty as the basic element of international law with newly developing principles based on global respect and guarantees of fundamental human rights and future development of international law. New ideas and concepts should be the subject of extensive discussion and negotiations between States, in a consensus in the international community, as was the case 55 years ago, when the United Nations Charter was adopted. freedoms will be necessary resulting the for Slovakia supports the early establishment of the International Criminal Court. The results of the negotiations of the Preparatory Commission for the International Criminal Court, especially the adoption of the draft Rules of Procedures and Evidence and the Elements of Crimes by consensus last June, are very encouraging. in the field of combating Slovakia equally supports the work of the United Nations international terrorism. The adoption of the international Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism is the latest fruit of the work in this field. Slovakia will sign the Convention by the end of the year 2000. its relevance. Slovakia In facing all the challenges of our era the United Nations must prove is convinced of the irreplaceable role of the United Nations in a whole range of global issues, the solution of which is practically impossible by Member States alone, on an individual or group basis, or at a regional level. If we want the term globalization to have only positive connotations, the endeavour to tackle the accumulated problems must become a matter of the highest interest to all of us. I believe that this Assembly will contribute to this endeavour. "}}
