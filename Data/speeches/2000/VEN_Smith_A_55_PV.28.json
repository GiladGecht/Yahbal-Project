{"speech":{"0":" I again extend our congratulations to the President on his election. The Millennium Summit has charted for us a plan of action future. We must consistently bear that plan of action in mind as our main priority, and direct all our work towards its immediate the for effective implementation. We cannot view the final document adopted by the most important gathering of world leaders ever held as a mere expression of good intentions and act as though it were a matter of routine and as if nothing had happened. It is equally urgent to ensure that the rules regulating international trade and finance are just and equitable, not only in theory but also in practice, so that they lead to development for all, and not merely to the further enrichment of a privileged minority. First, we must take action to ensure that the vast majority of the human race living in developing countries make significant progress the attainment of sustainable development. We must make special efforts with respect to the millions of men, women and children who live in poverty. They must be given means of subsistence, education and medical care. towards Our most important shared instrument, the United Nations, is currently ill-equipped for that enormous task. We must therefore focus on giving it the power and means to play an effective role in that important effort. We believe that the United Nations must play a central role in the struggle for development. To that end, we must consider without delay ways to strengthen the General Assembly, our most democratic and open to strengthen the Organizations primary instrument in this field, the Economic and Social Council, which should become a real council for human development, with authority and ability to act comparable to the Security Councils. is equally necessary institution. It The message of the Millennium Summit is very clear: peace and development are equally important, and each depends on the other. The most urgent tasks in the struggle against poverty are also clear: to alleviate the debt burden of highly indebted poor countries; to tackle the scourges of AIDS and malaria; and to provide education for all. In all of those tasks the United Nations must play a leadership role. In order to meet the established goals of reducing world poverty by half by 2015, we must ensure that national Governments measures adopted in accordance with the social platform of United Nations conferences, to benefit their populations in the areas of health, food and education, are accompanied by international cooperation based on solidarity, in order that those tasks are carried out efficiently and promptly. It is therefore particularly important, in order to support the objectives of, and strategies for, poverty eradication, their commitment to dedicate 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product to official development assistance. that developed countries meet In that regard, the high-level intergovernmental meeting on financing for development, to be held next year, should result in effective coordination and harmonization of all the efforts Governments and international organizations, so that those efforts may bear tangible fruits meeting the needs of all countries. The United Nations must be the coordinating centre for the World Trade Organization and the Bretton Woods institutions. With regard to foreign debt, it is vital that the international community promote, on the basis of North-South dialogue, the adoption of concerted measures for the effective resolution of this problem, which is seriously weakening the sustained economic growth of developing countries affected by the excessive burden of debt servicing. We believe that it will be necessary to consider the timely rescheduling on favourable terms of the international financial commitments of developing countries, including highly indebted poor countries and medium-income countries. The freeing of resources currently allocated to debt payment will make it possible for those countries more efficiently to meet the real needs of their populations in the areas of food, health and education. It will also promote their peoples participation and full integration within their respective societies. It is also necessary to recognize the economic and social costs incurred by developing countries in meeting foreign debt payments. Shared responsibility in dealing with economic and social issues, as well as with regard to questions of peace, effective participation by developing countries in the world economy, particularly the formulation of international and economic norms. in decision-making and requires more intensive and economic The efforts of the developing countries towards poverty eradication, economic and social progress, sustained sustainable favourable development international and on international cooperation for renewed and strengthened development. The magnitude and urgency of the challenges facing us in the economic and social sphere and a environment growth dependent are economic on 11 require the support of all Member States in order to realize the aspirations of those who cry out for a more equitable and just world, in which poverty eradication and the promotion of development are a genuine expression of international peace and stability. As for our other main priority, the maintenance of peace, we must learn from our experience â€” both from our mistakes and from our achievements. The United Nations must be provided with the means to anticipate and prevent conflicts, not just put an end to them once they have erupted. In this respect, disarmament, including nuclear disarmament, is vital, as is the elimination of the illicit arms struggle against transnational criminal activities such as terrorism and the illicit drug trade. trade. Also key the is to convene In this context, we welcome the proposal of the Secretary-General international conference on the reduction of the nuclear threat. We believe that this could help strengthen the commitment to eliminate nuclear weapons, as recently agreed at the sixth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). an Venezuela supports the convening of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, to be held next year. That Conference will be a perfect opportunity for us to combine our efforts to adopt measures of cooperation to eliminate this illicit activity, which has links is encouraged by unscrupulous groups or individuals who act unlawfully. transnational crime and to organized The role of the United Nations as the only forum empowered to authorize the use of force must be reaffirmed, without distinctions or exceptions, apart from self-defence, which in turn must be in strict compliance with the provisions of the Charter. It is urgent to this end to make effective progress towards reform of the Security Council. This does not mean mere cosmetic change, but rather real reform, with a view to ensuring its credibility as a democratic, transparent and impartial organ in which no country has the right to block, through the use of the veto, action agreed by the majority. If we wish the Millennium Summit to have real significance, if we want it to be remembered not only 12 the milestone represented by because of the participation of an unprecedented number of world leaders, we must take concrete action at this session of the General Assembly. Towards that end, Venezuela fully supports the proposal made recently by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay to create a working group the Millennium Summit Declaration. We believe that this group should be open to participation by all Member States. We believe also that the representatives of the countries that co-chaired the Summit and those that presided over the four round tables, as well as the Chairmen of the regional groups, should participate actively in this process. implementation of to ensure "}}
