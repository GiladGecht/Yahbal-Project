{"speech":{"0":" Allow me at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly. We are especially pleased that the designation went to a personality with remarkable career, a representative of the Republic of Korea, a country that maintains intense cooperation with Argentina. to acknowledge the excellent way in which the Foreign Minister of Finland, Mr. Harri Holkeri, presided over the Assembly at its fifty-fifth session. relationship also wish such a and a friendly I I would also like to express our satisfaction at the re-election of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for a second term. This reflects the unanimous support of the international community for the way in which he has decisively confronted the great challenges of peace, the rule of law and development at this very difficult stage of international life. The support given to him by the Member States reflects the widespread high opinion of his efforts and the work of the Organization, which was confirmed by the Nobel Peace Prize, a distinction that brings honour to those who work in the service of the United Nations and to its clear-sighted Secretary- General. This distinction also comes at a moment when the full relevance of the United Nations has become dramatically urgent as a result of the criminal attacks against the United States of 11 September. In the face of those events, I wish to reiterate our solidarity and commitment with its Government and people. It was an attack against us all, against all humankind. Those events have shown that terrorism can strike at any State and that no country can fight it in isolation. It is an international threat, and the only existing institution with the global reach, the United Nations, must confront that threat within the political and legal framework established by the Organization. its objectives The Millennium Declaration had already set as one of the adoption of concerted measures against international terrorism and the need for all States to accede as soon as possible to all the relevant international conventions. The adoption of Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) and of General Assembly resolution shows that the circumstances, with the goal of using every means available to counter the threat to peace and security represented by terrorism. the United Nations has been equal to differences or different interpretations related to other situations should not distract us from the urgent need to develop an that would encompass all aspects of this threat. instrument At the level of the hemisphere, we have put into practice the regional system of legitimate defence and collective security established in the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance. At the same time, we have fostered the full operation of the Inter-American Committee on Terrorism and the drafting of an inter- American convention, that complements existing universal conventions, as well as the convening of a special conference on hemispheric security. for the terrorism The global effort against is an imperative international community, one blessed by the United Nations. Within the guidelines approved by the Organization, all States, groups of States or regional organizations must contribute to this common struggle. Argentina expresses its full commitment to the fight against terrorism. Our nation has twice suffered attacks of this nature, in 1992 and 1994. The memory of those events helps us to understand the grief for innocent victims and to say that this fight is also our fight. The recent Security Council and General Assembly resolutions have been supplemented by other instruments that reflect the will of the majority of States to define any terrorist act, without exception, as criminal and unjustifiable, no matter what the intended purposes. Existing resolutions and conventions have outlined a series of specific measures and rules to foster judicial and police cooperation and have criminalized many acts of terrorism, enshrining the principle that all States have an obligation to prosecute and punish the perpetrators. the them among ratifying remainder, for Argentina is a party to the majority of the international treaties in effect and is making progress on the International Convention the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, of 1997, and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, of 1999. We support the conclusion of the conventions currently under consideration that should be finalized before the end of this year, such as the convention on nuclear terrorism. I hope that the negotiations on a convention of a general nature will be successfully concluded. The existence of political At the regional level, the Southern Common Market are promoting measures and operational coordination, cooperation and assistance among the various agencies entrusted with the fight against terrorism in the field. the countries of (MERCOSUR) technical enhance to that characterizes life, We must be aware that the approach to this problem will be incomplete if we fail to recognize the factors that nourish terrorism. In the framework of the interdependence increasing the the benefits of present stage of economic development reach only a few States, and the increasing marginalization of countries and societies that live in extreme poverty, the tragedy of neglected or undernourished children, sickness and hunger become more evident. This uneven economic distribution, made even more tangible by modern communications, causes frustration in wide sectors of the dispossessed and creates the conditions for the outbreak of conflicts and confrontations, on which fundamentalist movements of various kinds are at work. This is why we need to reaffirm here the fundamental statement made a few years ago by Pope Paul VI: “the new name for peace is development”. This is a task for the international community as a whole, in a joint effort and a spirit of solidarity. It is wrong to minimize the importance of international cooperation and to leave on their own those who have problems surviving in the face of global economic competition. The launching of a new round of negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) could be an increasingly important protectionist to promote world economic recovery in the short term and growth in the tendencies and control signal the to 21 long term. It is a signal that will also bring additional confidence to the financial markets. Through the launching of a new round in Qatar, the 142 member countries of the WTO could give impetus to a process that lays the foundations for a more equitable and peaceful world. for the region, causing the international The persistence of conflicts such as the one in the Middle East is a source of tension, with a wide range of repercussions legitimate concern community. The for Argentine Republic wishes to renew its expression of support for a stable and lasting peace in the Middle East, based on respect for the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent State, as well as recognition of the right of the State of Israel to live in peace within safe and internationally recognized borders. self-determination and to Violence and terrorism in any form are absolutely unacceptable and can only exacerbate the situation. The parties should urgently agree on a ceasefire and begin negotiations on a final settlement, which until recently seemed reachable. The Secretary-General has offered us a road map for implementing the Millennium Declaration, which provides a responsible programme for confronting our current serious circumstances. The principal milestones of that road map deserve our support as a sound way towards peace-building and strengthening our security: the rule of law to fight terrorism with determination; conflict and of the reform of sanctions peacekeeping operations; regimes to avoid civilian populations; the promotion of development; respect for fundamental human rights throughout the world and for political and religious plurality; and the firm rejection of any attempt religious creeds or nationalities with violence or terrorism. the eradication of poverty and to associate certain strengthening prevention in order affecting the international crimes. We underscore We also share the Secretary-Generals view of the importance of putting an end to the culture of impunity by bringing to trial the perpetrators of extremely serious the historical importance of the establishment of the International Criminal Court and we reaffirm our support for measures to promote its prompt launching. The great majority of humankind desires a future of peace and progress. The irrationality and violence of a minority can be isolated and defeated on the basis of 22 cooperation among nations following these general principles, which we endorsed in the Millennium Declaration, and in regard to which we propose concrete measures today. We trust that we shall be up to that challenge. I cannot conclude without recalling, as the General Assembly already knows, that the Argentine Republic is still engaged in a sovereignty dispute with the United Kingdom over the Malvinas, South Georgias and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas. The recovery of the full exercise of sovereignty over that part of our national territory, inhabitants and respecting international in our Constitution. This issue is on the agenda of this Organization, which through repeated resolutions has asked the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to resume negotiations on a just and lasting solution to the sovereignty dispute and thus to put an end to a colonial situation imposed by force in 1833. is a precept enshrined interests of their law, the Today, in response to that request, Argentina again reiterates its full readiness to resume bilateral negotiations with the United Kingdom in order to resolve the issue, as well as its support for the mission of good offices appropriately entrusted the Secretary-General by the General Assembly to assist the parties in achieving that goal. to I conclude by calling for peace, justice and solidarity, so widely sought by all peoples defending life throughout the world.
