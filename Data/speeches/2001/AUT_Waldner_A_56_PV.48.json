I wish to express my deep sympathy to all those families and to the great number of people affected by this tragedy. Let me at the outset congratulate His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election to this high office. While assuring him of my delegations full cooperation and support, I am confident that under his guidance and leadership — which he has already proven in the first days of his new function — this session of the General Assembly will contribute to strengthening global cooperation and its indispensable platform, the United Nations, in the coming months. I should also like to take this opportunity to reiterate my very best wishes to the Secretary-General on his appointment to a second term of office. Furthermore, I would like to congratulate him very warmly on being awarded, jointly with the United the Nobel Peace Prize, an honour and Nations, recognition he leadership, dedication and courage the service of our Organization. This award also signals recognition of and encouragement for the United Nations and all those who are committed to its mission, not least United Nations staff members. truly deserves for his in 22 Allow me to also express here our thanks to the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for the many efforts he undertook not only in conducting day-to-day business, but also in revitalizing the United Nations, in particular the General Assembly. My colleague, the Foreign Minister of Belgium, has already addressed this Assembly on behalf of the European Union. Austria fully endorses his remarks. Two months have passed now since the heinous terrorist attacks of 11 September. Although we are still in shock at the loss of thousands of innocent lives, we have, however, also been encouraged by the resolve expressed in the collective response of the community of nations, here in the General Assembly and in the Security Council. This unanimous strong reaction gives us hope that today our nations are ready to cross over a threshold, leaving behind a world of deadly divisions and entering a genuine global community. of type of terrorism Secondly, the menace There are some positive signs to that effect. These are, first, that during the past weeks, we have witnessed new astonishing political — maybe even geopolitical — alignments that, if followed through, are comparable to other watershed events of historic an proportions. unprecedented, devastating is compelling us to take a fresh look at the root causes of much that is unacceptable in our world, according to our own standards, but which we have been tolerating, or at least living with, quite contrary to our declared principles. I refer to the abject levels of poverty, inequality and injustice. These factors are at the origin of many conflicts around the globe. Some of them are particularly dangerous, providing breeding grounds for global terrorism or serving as pretexts for terrorists. It would be irresponsible if we — the international community — did not engage in renewed efforts to find solutions to these regional conflicts, be they in the Middle East, in Afghanistan, in Kashmir, in the Caucasus or in the Balkans, as well as in the area around the Great Lakes, for instance, which has seen so much human suffering. The European Union, on a continent marked by centuries of war, has developed its model of conflict resolution. It is held in three words: cooperation, partnership, is engaged in a welcome policy of extending this zone of peace. We hope that the enlarged Union, planned to integration. The European Union become a Union of 28 and later more, will be able to contribute more effectively to peace and stability in the world. Under the present circumstances, Austrias priorities outside Europe are the Middle East and Central Asia, not least because these areas have a direct bearing on the fight against terrorism in its present phase. The Middle East conflict has been on our agenda without interruption since the time of the creation of the United Nations. There is no doubt that we have a special obligation to contribute to a just and viable solution. A heightened sense of responsibility is felt when, on the one hand, violence escalates, but when, on the other — as I see it — new opportunities have emerged. Austria is therefore of the opinion that major concerted efforts should be undertaken so that negotiations can resume on the basis of Security Council resolutions without delay. Only sincere negotiations and a sincere renunciation of violence can bring a rapprochement of the two parties and, finally, peace. Afghanistan is a reminder of what happens when a conflict is neglected too long. Now, there is a new dimension unfolding. We are forced to act. The humanitarian tragedy is obvious. In this context, Central Asia deserves increased attention, for example, in view of assistance in the maintenance of stability and concertation aiming at the necessary reconstruction of Afghanistan. I should like to say a word as to the Balkans, a neighbouring region to my country. It must not be neglected, although new dangers emerge elsewhere. In the western Balkans, there is progress, especially in Zagreb, in Belgrade, in Tirana and in Sarajevo, but overall stability and economic recovery are not yet assured. Extremists have not yet disarmed. We have to keep up a high profile of international commitment. regard. This Combating terrorism is, of course, not a one- dimensional task. It requires cooperation on many fronts. I see the United Nations as playing a key role in this requires a clarification and coordination of tasks within the United Nations system so as to ensure the necessary synergy. There is also a role for regional cooperation. To provide an example, a so called regional security partnership has been established between Austria and its European Union neighbours, candidates some of for membership, across the boundaries that, for half a century, divided Europe. Overall, we must address long-term societal development at the local, national and global levels and the capacities required to build a universally shared political culture based on respect for human rights and human dignity, including for the plurality of identities at all levels of society. requires challenge intersectoral Let me elaborate now on the United Nations role. The time has certainly come to significantly strengthen the United Nations capabilities and programmes in combating and preventing terrorism. The complexity of inter- the institutional cooperation. We have the principal organs of the Organization, including their specialized subsidiary organs, such as the Security Councils Committee on the General Assemblys Ad Hoc Committee on Terrorism, the Economic and Social Councils Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and the appropriate Secretariat units to perform the tasks that are now urgently needed. to enable terrorism, and The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice will hold a special meeting on terrorism in the context of the Vienna Declaration on Crime and Justice on 15 November 2001. Just one week prior to the terrorist attacks of 11 September, plans of action for the implementation of the Vienna Declaration were adopted. They will play an important role in the system-wide response to international terrorism, of recommendations for both national and international action. These recommendations stress once more the existing relationship between terrorism, on the one hand, and crime, including transnational organized crime and illicit drug trafficking, on the other. comprehensive including set a The United Nations Centre for International Crime Prevention and its Terrorism Prevention Branch have received a focused mandate, which should serve as a solid basis for enhancing the capabilities of the United Nations in the prevention of terrorism. To this end, the human and financial resources should be strengthened accordingly. to say, full terrorism requires support of each and every Government. Ratification of the various international legal the conclusion of negotiations concerning a comprehensive international instruments, as well as the challenge of Needless the 23 convention against terrorism, are of fundamental importance. The Terrorism Prevention Branch of the United Nations should also get immediately active in providing, where requested, concrete assistance to Member States in implementing national legislation required by Security Council resolution 1373 (2001), as well as in national capacity-building. institutions for human rights education and learning in Africa, South Asia, the Far East and the Pacific, Europe and Latin America. The proclamation of human rights cities in all of these regions might merit specific attention by the appropriate organs of the United Nations, the Commission on Human Settlements. including Several items on our global agenda have reminded us of the fundamental importance of the individual citizen and of society in economic, social, cultural and institutional development. Increasingly, we have understood the basic principles and values of our societies upon which the future of mankind is based. Our rejection of terrorism must be absolute. At the same time, we need to strengthen our networks and skills in dialogue, cross- identification and solidarity. the strategic role of We do need a globally shared political culture that is based on respect for global diversity, which finds its only limits in the right of others to diversity. We must never allow fanaticism, violence and terrorism to undermine the fabric on which peace and security are built. Now more than ever, we have to redouble our efforts in the development of our societies based on plurality and trust among peoples and cultures. In this context, the Secretary-Generals efforts to promote dialogue among civilizations, an initiative of President Khatami, can have enormous significance. Austria had the pleasure of inviting the Secretary- Generals Group of Eminent Persons for its first meeting in Vienna and was honoured by the Secretary- Generals personal participation last summers Salzburg dialogue among civilizations. Austrias commitment to dialogue has found its expression in a series of inter-religious encounters, especially between Christianity and Islam, over the past 10 years. These encounters have served to identify common values and to project them into the wider communities. For us, such dialogue has the core objective of developing societies hatred, disintegration and politically motivated violence against fellow citizens. preventing in capacities in Austrias efforts have also focused on another element of societal development. Long-term strategies of terrorism prevention require a globally shared culture of human rights. Let me mention briefly the growing cooperation between qualified regional 24 its effects not only We are aware that there is a direct relationship between the internal negation of human rights, on the one hand, and a culture of violence that may eventually project internally but also internationally and even globally. In view of accelerated globalization and worldwide economic, cultural and information relations, we may have to take proactive measures to strengthen our shared basic beliefs and political values through education and learning processes. The current United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education might also offer opportunities for appropriate initiatives in response to the horrifying scenario of global terrorism. In this context, we have to give greater recognition to the role of women in providing human security and human development in all our societies. The recognition is due in particular in crisis areas where women have not only been the victims of most of the intra-societal violence, but have also assured the survival of the neediest. to bear A case in point is Afghanistan and Afghan society. Eighty-five per cent of refugees and internally displaced persons are women and children. In fact, those who are often depicted as the weakest element in society had the brunt of violence and repression. As we design our programmes for reconstructing a post-terrorist Afghanistan, we must conceive of programmes by which women, in particular those now in refugee camps, are enabled to contribute their share in a governance of development, peace and cooperation. This is essential for a society that wishes to overcome the scars of decades of conflict and war. To be concrete, I therefore suggest that education and training programmes aimed at empowering women — in particular, those in refugee camps — to assume public responsibility in the reconstruction of immediately implemented. their country be The media bear an important responsibility in shaping societies value structures and capabilities. As Austrias Federal Chancellor Wolfgang increasingly Schussel said in his statement on the United Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations at the General Assemblys 42nd meeting, Austria taking an initiative, in the context of the partnership between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries, that will focus on the special role and responsibility of the media the societal development towards accepting and benefiting from the plurality of cultures and identities in this region. this partnership and in in is In conclusion, I should like to make a few comments on other very important developments with regard to items on our global agenda. The sustainable use of the local, national, regional and global natural resources with which we are endowed continues to be of foremost importance. The recent study by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) on the projected dramatic reduction of agricultural productivity — between 45 and 55 per cent in Africa, India, southern China and Latin America — over the next 50 years due to climate change reminds us that the processes of long-term global change need as much action as our activities in coping with crises and combating criminal terrorism. The World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg will need not only a technical but also a political focus with an appropriate resolve for our shared global development. One specific area where newly shared policies and institutional support may be required, is the integration of energy policies the global sustainable development agenda. The Commission on Sustainable Development at its ninth session and the third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries recognized the strong connection between energy-policy interventions and poverty reduction. Energy considerations should therefore be fully the Millennium Declaration. Vienna, which hosts four prominent international organizations in the field of global energy policies — the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and IIASA — could offer, with Austrias support, a framework for developing an innovative platform in this regard. I look forward to exploring this issue further with interested partners. implementation of integrated into into the With many developing regions having to cope with the difficult and often precarious management of mountain resources, we should take advantage of the International Year of Mountains, 2002, for new initiatives in exchanging experience and for new programmes of cooperation. Finally, we are still working on implementing our resolve to strengthen the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations for accomplishing its important tasks. The Economic and Social Council reform paper by the Secretariats Department of Economic and Social Affairs contains, think, very valuable contributions to our ongoing debate. As Austria already suggested years ago, coordination and integration of the United Nations systems reporting in economic and social affairs and the preparation of a comprehensive “state of the world” report by the Secretary-General would not only facilitate but significantly enhance the role of the Economic and Social Council in policy formulation in this field. I When coping with the dynamic processes of global change in the economic sector, we have to put the human being back into the centre of our policies. New efforts have to be undertaken to internalize the multiple dimensions and costs of globalization. In this context, let me especially welcome the Secretary- Generals initiative of a new partnership with the global business community, inviting it to share in the responsibility for what is happening in the global public space. All the concerns I am addressing in this statement have a common focus: understanding the human being as an actor, a perpetrator, a victim and a partner, in other words, as the basic paradigm of global development. This is why human development, human rights and human security are the points from which we have to address both the current crises and our long- term development objectives. Mr. El-Khatib (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): Let me express our deep sadness at the human loss resulting from the crash this morning of an American aircraft in a Queens neighbourhood and our condolences to the families of the victims. I wish to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo and his friendly country on his election as President of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Let me also pay tribute to his predecessor for his able stewardship of the last session. Furthermore, I extend warm congratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his re- 25 the Nobel Peace Prize. That was election for a second term of office, as well as on his well-deserved award, jointly with the United Nations, of an acknowledgement of Mr. Annans remarkable track record in serving the purposes and principles of the Charter and a symbolic token of recognition of the centrality and relevance of the vital role of the United Nations in the world community. This great city which hosts our world Organization and the United States of America and its people have been struck by a cowardly terrorist attack that targeted innocent civilians. In truth, this act of aggression was committed not just against the United States but, in fact, against the entire international community and humanity. For it seems that the larger objective of the evil and dark forces that planned and executed those atrocities was the terrorization and intimidation of all of us and the precipitation of a worldwide cultural and religious confrontation. Their aim was to undermine and shatter our sense of common confidence and the bonds that unite us by stripping us of our own sense of security and driving us to deal with each other in an atmosphere of mistrust, fear and hatred. is the demonstration of One of the many painful impacts of those terrorist attacks the depth of interdependence in our modern life. The repercussions went beyond the United States. The victims belonged to dozens of nations, including Jordan, and all of us almost instantly felt the negative economic effects. Thus the fight against terrorism should be comprehensive. This means forging a unity of purpose and determination to win this war on all fronts. It also means exercising care and caution so that we do not fall into the trap set by the terrorists. Indeed, our war against terrorism is neither a religious war nor a clash between one civilization and another — or even between one nation and another. Last 11 September, Jordan reaffirmed its long- standing and clear position, which is anchored in its firm policy of rejecting the use of terrorism in international relations, irrespective of any argument advanced, pretext invoked or label given. Thus, His Majesty King Abdullah II declared Jordans categorical condemnation of terrorist attacks perpetrated against the United States and Jordans support for the international effort against terrorism. In the same vein, His Majesty expressed resolve to safeguard the sanctity the 26 of the Islamic faith from any abuse or distortion caused by terrorism or terrorists, insisting that terrorists must be deprived of any opportunity to hijack religion and to misuse it to serve their purposes or advance their agenda. In particular, terrorists must be barred from provoking a confrontation between Islam and the rest of the world. The suppression and defeat of those pernicious schemes require, among other things, the enhancement of understanding among peoples and cultures. They also demand a genuine respect for cultural diversity. Human pluralism should, ideally, be a force of enrichment and inspiration for the community of nations. The world is perhaps pressed now more than ever launch a meaningful dialogue among civilizations that highlights common denominators with a view to promoting tolerance and reinforcing our ability to coexist and interact in peace and harmony. The United Nations system remains the appropriate framework and venue for such a dialogue. to Islam and Muslims throughout history have enriched human civilization. The contributions of Muslim scholars in science, literature and culture in general reached the heights they did due to a climate of open-mindedness, tolerance and pluralism established by Islam. We in Jordan take pride in the true coexistence and integration of our community life, which has been fashioned over the past 14 centuries. Muslims and Christians live side by side in national unity, where religious pluralism is an enriching factor, making Jordanian society a good example of social harmony and interaction. Terrorism will exploit political, economic and social imbalances and the absence of justice to advance its goals. Therefore, addressing the main causes of despair, frustration and sense of injustice in a serious manner is perhaps the most effective way to confront terrorism and pre-empt its potential appeal and support. We recognize that a truly effective international effort to eradicate terrorism primarily requires, as far as the Middle East region is concerned, a just and acceptable resolution of the question of Palestine, whose long-running implications on the ground remain the chief source of pain and suffering across the region. The current situation of constant killings and destruction as a result of Israels practices of using force against the Palestinian people and the siege of their towns and communities constitute a constant incitement that feeds escalation in a way that endangers security and stability throughout the whole region. Jordan firmly believes that the resolution of this conflict will not be possible by the use of force or by security and coercive measures. There is really no alternative before the two sides but to return to the negotiating table as equal partners and to seek a settlement that ensures their legitimate rights and their future. This option will remain elusive until parallel mutual steps are adopted on the basis of the accords and obligations agreed upon by both the Palestinian and Israeli sides. His Majesty King Abdullah II has been engaged in enormous efforts to help the region break out of the vicious circle engulfing it because of the ongoing confrontations between the two sides. King Abdullah has contributed positively to the intense international contacts and efforts to achieve that goal. Those endeavours have indeed led to the building of a full international consensus on the requirements needed to break requirements include, in the first place, ending the use of the Israeli military machine against the Palestinian people, lifting the blockade imposed on them and abandoning the policy of assassinations and incursions into areas under the control of the Palestinian National Authority. the current deadlock. Those Implementing those steps would set out an appropriate entry to start the implementation of the recommendations of the Mitchell Commission, the thrust of which is to create favourable conditions that allow return to the negotiating table. Ten years after the Madrid Peace Conference, the region is seething with frustration over the failure to reach the long-awaited peace. People there are no longer satisfied by the mere existence of a peace process. Therefore, the revival of the peace process in itself is no longer tenable in the absence of a genuinely meaningful effort that translates into concrete progress on the road to peace. Prolonged confrontations have resulted not only in the failure to carry out several obligations agreed upon, but also in retreating from undertakings that were already in place. This demonstrates that phased and interim agreements are inadequate and ineffective to address the status quo. Therefore, starting the final status negotiations has become now a pressing priority in order to achieve the principal objective of the peace process, namely, the fulfilment of the national rights of the Palestinian people and the establishment of their viable independent State in their homeland, as well as the guaranteeing of the security of Israel. Peace that can be acceptable to the peoples of the region must be comprehensive in terms of resolving, on the one hand, the whole array of major issues: the occupied territories, Jerusalem, the refugees, security and weapons of mass destruction, and economic cooperation; and including on the other, all tracks and the States concerned. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) remain the basis of the peace process. Their implementation requires putting in place the true components of peace: primarily, the renunciation of the settlement policy which contradicts the “land for peace” principle and which is in itself a flagrant breach of law. Peace and settlements are mutually exclusive. international therefrom and from Holy Jerusalem is key to peace. It is an occupied Palestinian territory subject to the application of resolution 242 (1967), which aims at achieving Israeli withdrawal the Palestinian territories — occupied in 1967 — so that Jerusalem will become the capital of the State of Palestine. In addition, an appropriate formula will have to be worked out to ensure that the entire city of Jerusalem will be open, freedom of worship for all will be safeguarded and the city will be a factor of unity and reconciliation among all believers in God. the rest of in order the greatest source of the Palestinian refugees The issue of refugees represents the worst form of injustice and frustration in the conflict. Justice must be secured for to frustration and eliminate suffering in the region. Jordan, time and again, has made clear its firm position in relation to the question of refugees here in the Assembly. Let me emphasize that Jordan will accept only a solution to the question of refugees that takes fully into account its rights and interests as a State, as well as the rights and interests of its citizens, on the basis of international law and all relevant United Nations resolutions. Lack of trust between the two sides precludes their ability to achieve any progress without an active involvement by a third party. Jordan welcomes President George W. Bushs announcement endorsing a solution that ensures the existence of two States, 27 announcement the including the establishment of a Palestinian State on the Palestinian territory currently occupied by Israel, in accordance with relevant Security Council resolutions. This international consensus on for achieving peace in the region. It is our hope that the United States efforts will continue with support from the countries of the European Union, the Russian Federation and the international community as a whole in order to reach that goal. the requirement completes fundamental A comprehensive peace must include Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian territories to the border of 4 June 1967 and the completion of its withdrawal from the remaining occupied Lebanese territories on the basis of relevant Security Council resolutions. The suffering of Iraq and its people, due to the international sanctions imposed against them for more than 11 years, is yet another source of frustration and tension in the region. Jordan once again stresses the need to lift those sanctions and the importance of creating conditions that will allow Iraq to reclaim its active regional and international role. Jordan also emphasizes the Security Council implementation resolutions, to Kuwaiti prisoners and other missing persons. importance of of relevant those completing the including relating We hope to see an end soon to the plight of the people of Afghanistan so that that nation and its political forces can agree on a form of government to represent it. We also hope that the world community will mount a genuine effort to assist the people of Afghanistan in facing the tragic economic conditions that have been afflicting them for many years. Our relentless pursuit of a just peace in our region has not disrupted our determined efforts to seek economic, social and political development. To the contrary, Jordan is now poised to embark on a new, integrated enterprise that seeks more economic growth in order to improve the living conditions of its population and to open up new vistas of hope and promise for our future generations. Indeed, the dignity and welfare of the individual must always remain the noblest goal of our national and international endeavours. "}}
