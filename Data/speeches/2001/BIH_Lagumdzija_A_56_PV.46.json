{"speech":{"0":" I am grateful for the opportunity to address the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to you, Sir, on your well-deserved election. I would like to join those who spoke before me in expressing my deep condolences to the people of the United States. The date of 11 September will be forever inscribed in our minds and hearts as the symbol of the most blatant affront to civilization and commonly accepted values. Regardless of the brutality of the terrorist attacks directed against innocent civilians, however, they failed in the attempt to polarize the world and to undermine the very foundations of our societies. Those attacks were attacks against all of us, too. We therefore fully support the approach outlined yesterday morning by President Bush. Yes, the fight against all kinds of terrorism must be determined and precise. It has to target terrorists, who must be apprehended and brought to justice. At the same time, we have to do much more when we are talking about quick and massive help to the innocent civilians of Afghanistan. I would like to use this opportunity to recall that the resolutely terrorism. And I am my country promptly and worldwide coalition against joined 16 convinced that, by adopting such a clear position, my country is a part of the solution, rather than a part of the problem, in this particular field. I spoke about this more extensively in this same Hall two days ago on the occasion of the meeting devoted to the dialogue among civilizations. Coming from Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was treated by various kinds of fundamentalists and radicals as a problematic and questionable Balkan country because of its multi-ethnic and multicultural nature, I am especially sensitive to the type of terrorism that misuses religious feelings and, in so doing, jeopardizes local societies and global society. The war against terrorists is justified, but all of us will be losers if we fail to do everything we can to help the innocent people who are suffering today. Our experience in Bosnia and Herzegovina teaches us that military intervention, even when complemented by humanitarian assistance, for a sustainable, long-lasting solution. is not enough At the same time, we — and when I say “we”, I mean the international community speaking with one voice, together with local democratic forces, regardless of their current strength — have to have a clear vision of a political solution, accompanied by a programme for social and economic development, once the military intervention is over. Only such a comprehensive approach — military, humanitarian, political and socio- economic — will leave no room for the terrorists to interpret the intervention in Afghanistan as a war against Islam or as a symbol of the clash of civilizations. The terrorists will lose. Without a comprehensive approach, we might be losers, too, by the measure of ethical and universal human values. That is why we have to tackle these areas of future action together, starting today. its new At a time when humanity has reached for the highest objectives but also carried out the worst deeds, there should be no doubt that the United Nations can fulfil tasks, confronting old and new challenges, leading in the building of a prosperous world founded no longer on force but on the rule of law, not on a balance of power but on a balance of cooperation. The contribution of the international community in achieving progress in my country, Bosnia and Herzegovina, was particularly visible in the role of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Stabilization Force, the United Nations High Representative, the Peace Implementation Council, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and other members of the family of the international community present in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We particularly recognize and value the role of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina in police reform and the substantial upgrading of the judicial system. The United Nations family of organizations was certainly one of the key players in the development of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a multiethnic, tolerant and democratic State. Knowing that the mandate of the United Nations Mission in the present form will terminate by the end of 2002, we expect the United Nations mission activities to continue in a different form. However, we would like to see a smooth transition without any interruption in these extremely important activities. The noble goals and accomplishments of our Organization were honoured recently, and I would like to extend sincere and heartiest congratulations to the Secretary-General and the whole of the United Nations for the Nobel Peace Prize Committee. recognition by the I would like to inform the Assembly that we have decided to present candidature of Bosnia and Herzegovina for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council for the year 2010. We are convinced that by doing so, we confirm our commitment to contributing fully to the work of the United Nations. It would also be a clear sign of advanced stability and normalization of in our country, and particularly of our commitment to economic and democratic development. Therefore, we hope that as early as in 10 years from now, Bosnia and Herzegovina will succeed in becoming a member of the most important political body of the United Nations. life In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are working daily to live up to the vision of a safer and more peaceful, stable and self-sustaining country. Our efforts are directed toward three main sets of priorities. First is the rule of law, through the speedy implementation of latest Constitutional Court decisions and through proper judiciary and police actions terrorism and organized crime, fighting the combating corruption, arresting indicted war criminals and creating a stable environment for the return of refugees. Second are the further building and strengthening of the States institutions. Third are economic reforms directed to the strengthening of economic activities; establishment of a single economic space; and setting up the conditions for upgraded education, thus offering a choice for our young generations to stay in Bosnia and Herzegovina and become an inseparable factor in its development and future. legal framework according Of course, implementation of the DaytoParis Peace Agreement and the continuous adjustment and upgrading of our to European standards are the foundation of activities of the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina at all levels. Once again, I would like to express the gratitude of my Government to the international community for its devoted support of the enduring stability and development of my country. We are determined to move from the position of a patient or passive recipient of aid from international organizations and institutions to one of a partner in and contributor to international efforts. We have to go through the process of being first a recipient and then a partner in order to finally become the owner of the changes in our country. rest primarily with We are aware that responsibility for healing the consequences of the war and post-war stagnation, and for the removal of impediments to faster stabilization and progress, the political leadership in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The future of Bosnia and Herzegovina is in its integration into European and North Atlantic organizations. The establishment of contractual the European Union and association process is one of the priority strategic goals of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Further improvement of good relations with neighbouring countries and increased regional cooperation remain key elements for the stability and development of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region. relations with stabilization through the Relations with the Republic of Croatia since the democratic changes in January last year are improving every day, in every sense. As a result of the democratic changes last year in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Bosnia and 17 Herzegovina has established full diplomatic relations with that country, which opened the official channels of the two countries to deal with a number of important matters. However, a number of issues that burdened relations between the neighbouring countries are still on the agenda. Some of them have already been solved in bilateral meetings, but we are looking forward to tackling them more actively. Today is exactly one year since the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, for the first time in 10 years of being driven by nationalism, gave less than 50 percent of their votes to three major ethnic parties. It took us almost four months to establish the new, democratic, multi-ethnic, Europe-oriented Government that is now in place. We believe that we are on the way to striking a proper balance between the necessary assistance of the international community and further decision-making by ourselves. Finally, I can assure you today that our country has a leadership with a clear vision and is ready to act accordingly. For years, Bosnia and Herzegovina was one of the worlds international and regional problems. Today, my country is becoming one of the solutions. With this conviction, we are looking at the important challenges and tremendous tasks that are still ahead of us. We must confront them without delay. I am standing here to say we will do it. Mr. Tang Jiaxuan (China) (spoke in Chinese): Mr. President, first of all, please allow me to warmly congratulate you on your election as President of the fifty-sixth session of the United Nations General that under your able Assembly. I am confident guidance and with the close cooperation of all delegates, this session will be crowned with success. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to Mr. Holkeri for what he did as President of the last session of the General Assembly. A year ago, the United Nations convened the historic Millennium Summit. The United Nations Millennium Declaration the Summit identifies the objectives for promoting world peace and development in the new century. issued by International developments over the past year demonstrate that more and more countries have opted for increasing dialogue and cooperation, preserving world peace and seeking common development. To be 18 sure, the cause of human progress still involves a long and arduous effort. Factors of uncertainty in the international situation are on the rise. More efforts should be made to democratize international relations, and there has been no marked change in the irrational international economic order. Terrorism is a widespread scourge that threatens world peace and stability. We strongly condemn the terrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September, and extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the innocent victims, as well as to the Government and the people of the United States. China has always opposed all forms of terrorism. No matter when, where or in what form terrorism strikes, and no matter whom it is directed against, it should be met with condemnation and responded to with counter- strikes by the international community, which should adopt a unified position on the matter. China has taken an active part in international cooperation against terrorism. In addition to joining most of the international conventions against terrorism, China has ratified the Shanghai Convention on Combating Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism, concluded by the member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. China is in favour of a primary role for the United Nations and the Security Council in the international effort against terrorism. China supports the relevant resolutions that have been adopted and is in favour of closer cooperation and coordination among the various countries concerned to this end. China strongly believes that any military action against terrorism should have a clearly defined target and avoid harming innocent people. All such actions should be consistent with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and other universally recognized norms of international law, and should serve the long-term interests of peace in the region and the world at large. China believes that terrorism is a tiny fringe of extreme evil, representing neither one particular ethnic group nor one particular religion. They must not, therefore, be lumped together. China, too, is threatened by terrorism. The “Eastern Turkestan” terrorist forces are trained, equipped and financed by international terrorist organizations. The fight against the “Eastern Turkestan” group the international fight against terrorism. important aspect of is an In todays world, the question of security is becoming increasingly multifaceted and globalized. Only enhanced international cooperation can help us effectively cope with global security challenges and bring about universal and lasting security. Countries should endeavour to foster a new security concept, based on mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality and collaboration. They should seek security through mutual trust and pursue cooperation to their mutual benefit so as to effectively reduce factors of insecurity. The issue of arms control has always been closely interrelated with that of security. In the face of the new situation, we should go on working for the preservation of the existing legal regime for international arms control and disarmament and for the maintenance of global strategic stability, without jeopardizing the security of any country. that broke out Tackling regional hot spots is vital to regional and global security. We are following with deep concern the current developments in the Middle East. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict in September last year is continuing unabated. It poses a grave threat to the Middle East peace process and to regional stability. China supports the relevant United Nations resolutions and the principle of land for peace. It also supports the Palestinian people in their just struggle to regain their legitimate national rights and interests. We hope that the Israeli and Palestinian sides will take constructive measures and closely coordinate with the international community in its mediating efforts so as to create conditions for easing the tension and reactivating the peace process. China supports a greater role for the Security Council in this respect. We are concerned about the situation in South Asia. Given the current complex situation, we hope that the countries in the region will strengthen mutual understanding and mutual trust and coexist in peace and amity. As a neighbour of Afghanistan, we have been following the changing Afghan situation closely. We believe that, in order to find a solution to the Afghan issue, the following principles should be observed. First, the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Afghanistan should be ensured. Secondly, the Afghan people should be allowed to decide on a solution independently. Thirdly, the future government in Afghanistan should be broad-based and embody the interests of all ethnic groups in the country; Afghanistan should live in amity with all countries, particularly its neighbours. Fourthly, the solution should serve peace and stability in the region. Fifthly, the United Nations should play a more active role. Since the beginning of this year, the world economy has clearly slowed down, and the situation has been further aggravated by the incidents of 11 September. Developing finding are themselves straits. The international community must act with a greater sense of urgency and accord higher priority to development. countries dire increasingly in Developed countries should act more vigorously to promote development. They should adopt effective measures and make greater efforts to revitalize the global economy. We hope that the developed countries will demonstrate a broader vision and a cooperative spirit in providing assistance to developing countries. In recent years, anti-globalization activities in many parts of the world have increased. In fact, globalization is neither a panacea for development nor a monster causing disaster. The appropriate response to globalization should maximize its advantages and minimize its disadvantages so that all countries can come out winners and prosper side. Globalization should benefit all people from all social strata in all countries. side by international cooperation increase The United Nations has an irreplaceable role to in to play globalization. in development and work more effectively to fulfil the development objectives set forth in the United Nations Millennium Declaration. in response input should its It is China supportive of the World Trade Organizations plans launch a new round of multilateral trade talks. It is our hope that the new round will give full consideration to the concerns and interests of the developing countries. to The Ninth Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders Meeting was held successfully in October in Shanghai, China. The meeting was convened at a critical moment, soon after the incidents of 11 September, when prospects for the global economy seemed grim. Focusing on the theme “Meeting new challenges the new century: promoting common prosperity through participation and cooperation”, the leaders conducted an in-depth exchange of views and reached broad consensus. Having boosted intra-APEC cooperation among the in 19 their resolve members and reinforced to restore economic growth, the meeting sent out a clear, positive signal to markets throughout the world and took a resolute step forward in advancing cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. The meeting will have a positive and far-reaching impact on Asia-Pacific economic cooperation. President Jiang Zemin made clear to the world Chinas future objectives, guiding principles and domestic and foreign policies in the important speech that he delivered on 1 July this year. The principal task for the Chinese people in the new century is to press ahead with the modernization programme, work towards the grand cause of national reunification, safeguard world peace common development. and promote Indeed, the purpose of Chinas foreign policy is to safeguard world peace and promote common development. China needs environment of friendship and good-neighbourliness and external conditions of stability and prosperity. To achieve, and safeguard, such an international environment serves Chinas national interests. It is also Chinas duty as a member of the international community. an We believe that all civilizations and social systems in the world can, and should, exist side by side on a long-term basis, complementing one another and making progress together, in a spirit of seeking common ground while putting aside differences. We stand ready to engage in mutually beneficial cooperation with all countries in the world on an equal footing towards world peace and development, with the aim of achieving common development. Our entry into the World Trade Organization will usher in a completely new phase of our opening-up process. in lawful seat This year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the restoration of Chinas the United Nations. Tremendous changes have since taken place in the world, in China and in the United Nations. Chinas commitment to the Charter of the United Nations, however, remains unchanged. In the new century, China will, as always, vigorously support the work of the United Nations and continue to work together with other Member States for a better world. "}}
