{"speech":{"0":" We understand that an American Airlines flight to the Dominican Republic has gone down in Queens. We extend the condolences and the support of my Government to the United States and the Dominican Republic. That we have forged ahead with the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly and that political leaders have assembled for the general debate mark an extraordinary accomplishment, one that brings great credibility to the United Nations. I applaud and thank all who reside in this great city for continuing their work. Today, more than ever, our efforts and energies should focus on the purposes and principles of our Charter and should inspire hope and confidence in all humanity. implementing Foreign Minister Han Seung-soo, on behalf of my delegation, I extend congratulations to him on his election as President of the fifty-sixth session of the Assembly. The manner in which he has guided our work thus far is outstanding and worthy of our recognition. We wish him continued success as he presides over this Assembly. To the Secretary-General and to the United Nations, we extend congratulations on being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Before I proceed, please allow me, on behalf of the Belizean people, to extend to the President and the people of the United States of America, especially to the people of New York City, our heartfelt condolences on the tremendous loss suffered on 11 September. For most of us, the immediate reaction to this tragedy was one of shock and disbelief. As we joined in mourning the loss of innocent lives, including some of our own nationals, the international community moved swiftly to adopt a number of resolutions here at the United Nations. Through these actions we forcefully condemned acts of terrorism and reached out to the United States of America in solidarity, firm in our support to uphold the principles of justice and the maintenance of peace. Today, despots feast in the raging rivers of desperation, seeking refuge among the weak, preying upon the vulnerabilities of the less fortunate. Those who are caught in the sweeping currents of poverty, forced to live in a world were a dollar is a luxury, find little hope for a better future and are often abused by those who manipulate them for selfish and destructive reasons. For us, securing a better future for the millions who live in poverty continues to be our most noble of challenges. To meet this challenge, the United Nations must remain true to its task as set forth in the Charter and reaffirmed just over a year ago when our heads of State and Government gathered here and adopted the Millennium Declaration. That Declaration outlines various issues critical to the realization of a world with less poverty, death and despair, exhorting the values of freedom, equality, justice and tolerance. We must not allow the events of 11 September to cause us to lose our focus on this righteous undertaking — we must stay the course. For Belize, the path to fulfilling the goals of the Millennium Declaration begins with addressing the issues of development and poverty eradication. We confirm our support for the Agenda for Development. As a small State working to provide greater opportunities for its people, especially those who live in poverty, meaningful sustainable development is critical and can be achieved only through partnership with the international community. Regional and global cooperation are fundamental components for progress and necessitate a universal acceptance of our shared responsibility to create opportunities for growth and development. Please allow me to say a few words in Spanish. (spoke in Spanish) Globalization our interdependence and the importance of cooperation with the rest of the world based on the principle of mutual respect. Genuine sustainable development requires inclusive and transparent trading practices that allow for the participation of developing countries in the global economy. The geographical location of Belize enables us to participate in the Caribbean Community and the Central American Integration System, which gives us the opportunity to offer different perspectives in the fight against poverty. At the same time, it increases our possibilities for greater participation in all entities concerned with developing innovative mechanisms to efficiently integrate our economies into the global economic system. In this respect, we consider that equitable and participatory cooperation in which our concerns and vulnerabilities will receive the attention they deserve is fundamental. demonstrates amply (spoke in English) The twenty-sixth special session of the General Assembly on HIAIDS, held last June, brought the international community together to collectively affirm the urgent need for critical action on the part of all stakeholders to combat this pandemic. For us in the Caribbean, the Conference was of special importance. Ranked the second highest region in rate of HIAIDS infection after sub-Saharan Africa, Caribbean States are working with their international partners to combat the spread of this deadly disease. Any progress made during the HIAIDS special session must be attributed to the collaborative spirit displayed by all those involved, at both the political and technical levels. The inclusion of civil society, as well as the private sector, contributed to the effectiveness of the conference and remains critical to the success of any programme to eradicate HIAIDS. We welcome the decision of the Secretary-General to reach out to the entire world community to assist in the establishment of the Global HIAIDS and Health Fund, in an effort to help alleviate the suffering of the millions of people afflicted by the scourge. protection our environment is a major concern to the developing world, as so many of us depend on our natural resources for our survival. The commitments made by the international community for the protection of the environment have not been implemented, and if they are not addressed urgently, the consequences will impact negatively our small dependent economies, as well as the economy of the global community. We attach great the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and welcome recently concluded meeting in Marrakech, hoping to see more States ratify the Kyoto Protocol. the successful preservation importance results of the to The and of the In the Central America and the Caribbean regions we perpetually suffer from the effects of natural disasters, with the number and intensity of hurricanes increasing over last decade. This has been attributed to the effects of climate change caused by global warming. For two consecutive years, Belize has been struck by category-four hurricanes, magnifying the need to protect our environment and minimize our vulnerabilities. It is imperative that we gear our efforts towards creating the necessary mechanisms to reverse and curtail negative actions that contribute to the deterioration of the state of our environment. For this 15 reason, Belize, along with its partners in the Caribbean region, continues to seek the support of the United Nations for a special regime for the Caribbean Sea. If we are to speak of shared responsibility for development and the maintenance of peace and security, this year especially we must ensure that everyone be allowed to participate in this global forum. In this light, we continue to appeal to this Organization to consider the right of the 23 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan and allow their voices to be heard in this world institution. Equally, we must continue to advocate recognition of the Palestinian peoples right to self-determination, including the right to their independent State. With to respect to our commitment the development of peace and security, Belize is pleased to report the continuation of dialogue with our neighbour, the Republic of Guatemala. We continue to support all efforts to peacefully resolve our differences. this agenda This year has been designated the United Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations. The recently concluded debate on item produced meaningful discussion on the advantages of diversity and its benefits to human progress. Enhanced by globalization, our actions impact others immediately, creating new realities that require more openness and greater sensitivity to the differences among us. In our country, where seven languages or dialects are spoken and diverse ethnic populations live together peacefully, my delegation welcomes the prospect of increased dialogue among civilizations, one inclusive of all peoples, that will improve upon the understanding of who we are and where we came from. The Secretary- General, in his report on the United Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations, noted the importance of ensuring the process of globalization be comprehensive and fair. Let us grasp the opportunity given to us through this process to work together as equal partners in this global community, seeking to understand our common objectives while respecting our differences. that recognizes The Millennium Declaration the existing inequalities in our world. Likewise, it offers a comprehensive formula for greater prosperity for all. It directs us towards a collective responsibility through greater partnership among the countries of the world. At this time, when we are faced with new global realities, let us make this Declaration meaningful by 16 accelerating our efforts to achieve the just objectives of lasting peace and prosperity for all of our peoples. Mr. Gadio (Senegal) (spoke in French): Pending further news, I also wish to share in the sadness we all feel on the announcement of an aeroplane crash in Queens. Through me, Senegal has the pleasure of addressing its warm congratulations to Mr. Han Seung- soo on his brilliant election to the presidency of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. His election clearly is a tribute to his outstanding qualities as a diplomat and statesman and it also expresses the unanimous recognition of the Member States of our Organization of his country, the Republic of Korea, for its steadfast commitment to the service of universal peace and international cooperation. I wish to express to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, our deep gratitude for the competence, commitment and spirit of openness with which he discharged his mandate during a particularly heavy year. Finally, I am happy to reiterate Senegals deep appreciation to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, and at the same time to reiterate to him our wholehearted compliments on his historic re- election, the dazzling consecration of outstanding qualities of a man of good will, conviction and vision, who has devoted his life to the noble causes of the United Nations. I also congratulate him on the brilliant recognition he and the United Nations have just received as the Nobel Peace Prize laureates. He deserves our full support in the pursuit and the achievement of the outstanding work in the area of reform in which he, along with his colleagues, is fully invested to bring our Organization closer to the realities of the twenty-first century. The terrorist attempts of 11 September, which tragically struck New York, the Headquarters of our Organization, Washington and Pennsylvania, have radically changed our vision of the world and of international relations. My country, Senegal, once again conveys its sympathy to the people of the United States and reiterates its heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families. Let us say it unambiguously: there is no moral, religious or political cause noble enough to justify terrorism or its always barbarous manifestations — which all of us without exception must condemn with unwavering unity and with the utmost force. Senegal is a secular democratic country whose population is more than 90 per cent Muslim; we reject all forms of confrontation between religions, cultures or civilizations. Senegal believes that Islam, like other revealed religions, is a faith of peace and tolerance, and vigorously condemns any equation of Islam with terrorism and any attempt to invoke or use religion for criminal purposes. The massacre of pregnant women and the destruction of buildings occupied by innocent civilians — Gods creatures every one — are acts that have no justification in any religion, least of all Islam, whose banner of peace and harmony among men and women, peoples, cultures and civilizations we proudly bear. Beyond simply condemning terrorism in all its forms, methods and manifestations, the international community must act firmly to eradicate terrorism, its sources of financing and its bases of action throughout the world. Senegal is committed to that course, which is why His Excellency President Abdoulaye Wade took the well known initiative of convening on 17 October at Dakar an African conference against terrorism, in which 27 countries participated. President Wade submitted to that forum a draft African pact against terrorism as a needed complement to the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism. The conference ended with the adoption of the Dakar Declaration against Terrorism, which firmly condemned terrorism in all its forms; reaffirmed our solidarity with all victims of terrorist acts, in particular the thousands of innocent civilian citizens of countries throughout the world who died on 11 September; and invited the OAU promptly to convene an extraordinary session on terrorism to consider, inter alia, the draft African pact against terrorism submitted by Senegal with the support of other countries. Let me make it clear that those who argue that Africa has priorities other than terrorism are surely forgetting that tragedy resulting from acts of blind slaughter struck first in Africa: in Kenya and Tanzania. With bald lack of consideration and respect for African lives, bombers in Nairobi killed 12 United States nationals and 212 Kenyans and wounded more than 3,000 of our Kenyan brothers and sisters. They have never expressed any regret, much less remorse, for their obvious contempt for us. Fighting international terrorism means saying loud and clear that Africans, like Europeans, Americans and all the other peoples of the world, have an equal right to safety, security, stability and peace. That is the powerful message that His Excellency President Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal wants to echo throughout the world. Let us remember his initiative for a genuine security policy in Africa, along with his initiative to review African debt and his Omega Plan — a genuine African globalization strategy which has now been merged with the Millennium Partnership for African Recovery the New African Initiative. to form among these; is undoubtedly There are years that the long march of history cannot conceal or obliterate, and the past 12-month period it was extraordinarily rich in events of great importance both for the United Nations and for Africa, the seat of humankind. Thus, within the framework of the fifty- fifth session, the Millennium Summit brought together in this Hall heads of State or Government to, in the felicitous words of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, identify and work to solve the worlds major problems. In an extraordinary convergence of views, world leaders reaffirmed their faith in the United Nations and its irreplaceable mission to protect international peace and security, to fight poverty, to promote economic and social development, to strengthen democracy and the rule of law and to ensure justice and equity among citizens, peoples, cultures and civilizations. In view of the universality which is the hallmark of the United Nations and which was reaffirmed at the Millennium Summit, Senegal firmly supports the legitimate request of the Republic of China on Taiwan to resume its seat in the Organization and in its specialized agencies. That request is not directed against any State Member of the United Nations; meeting it would be a key contribution to consolidating the ideal of the universality of the United Nations and to the advent of an era of peace and stability in that sensitive part of the world. Africa remains the region where some conflicts seem to exist in tragic eternity; it is where nearly half of the worlds refugees and displaced persons are to be 17 found; it is the site of 33 of the worlds 48 least developed countries. Africa is also the region whose inhabitants are the most appallingly affected by the HIAIDS and malaria pandemics. Unquestionably, that enormously disturbing situation calls out to the entire international community and, in particular, to Africans. That is why it is important to implement the outcome of the twenty-sixth special session of the General Assembly, which was devoted to the fight against HIAIDS. Last July, the African Union was christened at the historic Lusaka summit of the OAU. By that historic act, Africa committed itself, in a proactive and unified spirit, to find African solutions to the many challenges before it, by establishing a modern, viable, open institutional framework that can respond to Africas emergencies and needs in the new century. Here, I renew my congratulations to my friend and brother Amara Essy, to whom African heads of State or Government have entrusted the task of following Salim Ahmed Salim in shouldering the high responsibilities of the post of Secretary-General of the OAU and of putting in place the new structures of the African Union. The second major event of the Lusaka summit is part of the same pan-African dynamic: the adoption of a plan for the economic and social development of Africa, known as the New African Initiative — the new partnership for the development of Africa, to which I earlier referred. This has the quality of having been conceived by Africans for Africa on the basis of the merger of two novel projects: the Omega Plan of President Abdoulaye Wade; and the programme for an African renaissance of Presidents Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, Abelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria and Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria. That joint initiative should help create the synergy needed to eradicate poverty in Africa and to lay the foundations for sustainable economic and social development, which is a prerequisite for integrating the continent into the ongoing process of globalization. For the first time in the history of plans for the renewal of Africa, an international conference on the financing of the New African Initiative is planned for January 2002 at Dakar. That forum will truly be an African Davos and should make it possible to hold a fruitful dialogue among all development partners that have understood the renewal heralded by the new plan, 18 which sums up our experiences and symbolizes the hopes of all of us who unconditionally love Africa. There has been impressive progress in Africa this year with respect to the urgent need to tackle the root causes of the many conflicts that shake the continent and to work peacefully towards their lasting resolution. On the crises in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in Burundi and in Sierra Leone, we are pleased to say that significant milestones have been reached by all actors in the implementation of peace agreements already concluded. in Gaborone, Botswana, and From that standpoint, there is true cause for encouragement in the beginning of an inter-Congolese dialogue the recent formation, with the help of the incomparable Nelson Mandela, of the transitional government of Burundi for national reconciliation. It is now up to the Security Council to perform all of its responsibilities under Chapter VII of the Charter. These efforts deserve to be intensified and given diplomatic support by the international community through concrete actions to finance strategies for post-conflict peace-building. In the same spirit, it is important to support the efforts of Angola and the Organization of African Unity for the rapid settlement of the conflict in that country. In light of the debt crisis aggravated by the exponential drop in official development assistance, the international community must explore new ways and means to develop the third world, especially Africa, through, inter alia, an increase in direct foreign investment. It is this break with the past — this “epistemological” departure — that our President proposes to Africa and its partners. He argues that the aicredit couplet, which has been the principal way to finance development in Africa and has led to the impasse we all know, should be abandoned and replaced by an approach that makes Africa attractive and competitive, leading to a massive inflow of private investment, both domestic and international. The cycle of debt followed by ever greater debt — a cycle that has been described by our President as a scourge similar to the slavery that devastated Africa — should give way to an approach that brings in massive investment in an adequate fiscal and legal environment — investment capable of filling the gaps in priority sectors such as infrastructure, education, health, agriculture, new technologies and access to the markets of developed countries. This approach, of course, would be part of a strategy of good political and unqualified respect for the rule of law, democracy and human rights. economic governance and of that Conference just opened on Africa is relying greatly on the results of the Ministerial Conference the World Trade Organization the International for Development in Monterrey, scheduled for March 2002; and the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, planned for September, to provide innovative solutions to the challenges besetting Africa at the beginning of this millennium. in Doha; Financing Looking sadly toward the Middle East, Senegal is following recent developments with great concern and feels solidarity with the Palestinian people in light of the new tragedy. Horrified by the scope of this tragedy, Senegal condemns the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and the intensification of acts of violence against innocent civilians. Senegal addresses an earnest appeal to all the parties, the co-sponsors of the peace process, the European Union, the Security Council and the international community, for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied Palestinian areas; for the immediate cessation of all acts of violence and provocation; for respect for the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and the relevant United Nations resolutions; for the resumption of peace negotiations in accordance with the agreed timetable; and for the conclusion of an overall settlement agreement that is just, durable and in conformity with resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) of the Security Council. Peace cannot prosper nor can the development of the region be ensured so long as Israelis and Palestinians fail in their efforts to forge bonds of confidence, as sovereign States within internationally recognized and guaranteed borders. I am happy to note that the European Union and the United States have recently affirmed this, inasmuch as Israel and the future State of Palestine each have the right to exist, to live in peace and to develop in security and dignity. that the consolidation of the rule of law and the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms remain one of the major focal points of our national and foreign policy. The special importance that our President attaches to these matters has been eloquently to conclude by I wish saying expressed in the appointment of a woman to the post of High Commissioner for Human Rights. The World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance was held, despite all obstacles, and dealt with its agenda despite the complexity of the issues and the particularly difficult conditions under which the negotiations took place. My country, which had the honour to preside over the work of the Preparatory Committee, once again addresses a solemn appeal to all actors in international life to translate the Declaration and Plan of Action adopted at Durban into action. Thus, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, the world can be definitively freed of the scourge of racism, which represents a grave infringement of human dignity and a flagrant violation of human rights. Speaking of human rights, we also naturally think of the rights of women and children. The twenty- seventh special session of the General Assembly, planned for 8-10 May 2002, will adopt a new agenda for international community aimed at better ensuring, safeguarding and defending the rights of the child and promoting the Convention on that subject. The commitments to which our Governments will subscribe must be the conclusions of the Fourth World Youth Forum of the United Nations system, held in Senegal in August this year. implemented, as must the It is imperative that we face the challenges of peace and development. We have no other choice but to do so through multilateralism and universalism. Thus the world needs the United Nations, an organization that is universal and unique. This is the conviction of Senegal, which proclaims that a United Nations that is well restructured and more representative would be better equipped to face the challenges that humanity confronts today. Those challenges seem as immovable as mountains, but everything is possible in a world of solidarity, brotherhood, security and respect for the sacred character of human the inalienable right of all peoples to happiness and liberty. Mr. Asgrimsson (Iceland): Once again, we have witnessed a terrible incident in the neighbourhood of the United Nations here in New York. Although we do not know the circumstances, we are shocked, and it is clear that many have lost their lives. I express my sincere condolences to all those who have lost their loved ones in this tragic incident. life, dignity and 19 Allow me to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I am confident that he will guide us wisely through the complex tasks ahead of us in this session. The ability of the United Nations to act swiftly in response to acute crisis was seriously tested following the terrorist attacks on the United States. During these trying times, it has been valuable to have at the helm a Secretary-General who enjoys such wide support. Let me congratulate the Secretary-General and the United Nations on being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize — in my view, a well-deserved recognition of Kofi Annans leadership and of the dedication he and his staff have put into upholding the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. Hopefully, the award will serve as an inspiration as well as strengthen worldwide support for the United Nations and what it stands for. The tragic events of 11 September have radically challenged and changed our security environment. Fighting terrorism should therefore become a priority of the United Nations. We recognize that the United Nations has long been active in the fight against international terrorism, but we now need to go beyond political statements and become truly operational. This means developing new methods and, at the same time, making full use of all the means at the disposal of the United Nations system, the truly global character of the Organization and the numerous international legal instruments available to us. Iceland strongly supports the creation of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism and hopes that an agreement can be reached on such an instrument during the fifty-sixth session. Otherwise, we will lose the opportunity to develop the coherent strategy lacking today. We cannot fail to react. The key role the United Nations should play in fighting international terrorism must be an impetus to us to intensify our efforts to achieve a comprehensive reform of the Security Council in all its aspects. Iceland is seriously concerned about the slow progress made towards reaching this goal. It is essential and timely that the membership of the Council becomes more representative, and thus more likely to sustain the present international coalition in the fight against terrorism. It goes without saying that the efficiency of the Council must be secured. Enhancing transparency 20 in the decision-making process is also of importance, especially for non-member States. One of the main purposes of the United Nations is to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion. This continues to be of the utmost importance. Let me therefore make it absolutely clear that the fight against terrorism is not, and must not become, a fight against any religious or ethnic group. We must forms of discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance. Most importantly, we must at all times adhere to the basic values of human rights, freedom and democracy. avoid all implemented all Turning to the actions at the national level, Iceland is taking the necessary steps to ratify all relevant United Nations conventions against terrorism that we have not already ratified. Furthermore, Iceland has relevant Security Council resolutions, including resolution 1373 (2001). But in fighting the menace of international terrorism — a fight that we all agree needs to be both wide-ranging and forceful — we must, at the end of the day, not in any way undermine the basic values of our societies — those of human rights, the rule of law, and democracy. We need to strike a balance between freedom and the security measures we opt for. Uprooting terrorism in the world must go hand in hand with solving regional conflicts that threaten international peace and security. This is particularly true for the Middle East. By prolonging the violence and refusing to negotiate, both sides play into the hands of extremist elements that want neither a continuation of the peace process nor a political solution to the Middle East conflict. Both parties have to resume negotiations unconditionally. That is the only way to secure lasting peace in the region, which should be based upon the establishment of a viable and democratic Palestinian State and on the right of the Israelis security within internationally recognized borders. A continuation of the present dire conditions cannot be tolerated any longer. in peace and live to I said earlier that the events of 11 September have made United Nations reforms even more urgent. The same is true for the ongoing work to strengthen the peacekeeping capabilities of the United Nations. Until now, in United Nations peacekeeping operations has been modest. My country Icelands participation has participated in peacekeeping by providing civilian personnel such as gender experts and police and health professionals. With the changing and more complex nature of peacekeeping, the need for civilian personnel has been increased. The Icelandic Government decided last year systematically to increase its contribution to peacekeeping. Our aim is to provide more personnel to the United Nations, as well as to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union. By adopting resolution 1325 (2000) last year, on women, peace and security, the Security Council recognized the importance of incorporating a gender perspective into peacekeeping operations. When the United Nations becomes involved in peace-building and reconstruction in Afghanistan we have to make sure that resolution 1325 (2000) is honoured in the process, for the benefit of Afghan women and, as a result, for the Afghan population as a whole. The United Nations must play a key role in the nation- building process in Afghanistan. Iceland stands ready to contribute civilian experts should the United Nations become involved in a post-conflict operation. Next year, 10 years will have passed since world leaders met at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. We are asked, what has been accomplished in this past decade to secure the prosperity of future generations in harmony with nature? The truth is that there has been rather little progress and that we face enormous tasks. The world community will look towards the World Summit on Sustainable Development, in Johannesburg, for further commitments by all nations. In that context, I would like to quote Secretary- General Kofi Annan, who in his opening remarks at the 44th meeting, last Saturday, said “We must put the issue of sustainability where it belongs, in the centre of the policy-making process.” to sustainable development at It is therefore imperative that we renew our strong commitment the Johannesburg Summit. We are faced with new challenges, but also with new opportunities, namely, to build a global partnership to harness the forces of globalization in favour of sustainable development. The world community has just achieved, in the a milestone Marrakech, agreement on implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto negotiations have been especially difficult. Now we have reached the moment when we can bring the Protocol into force. But more needs to be done to include other key emitters of greenhouse gases in the battle against climate change. In the area of oceans — the foundation of human life — we have made some progress. We have adopted significant agreements, and we are looking at ways to improve the assessment of the state of the oceans in order further enhance marine protection and management. New knowledge and new approaches are also evolving, thus providing the world community with opportunities to improve protection of the oceans and the sustainable use of their living resources. to Last October, Iceland, in cooperation with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and Norway, hosted the Reykjavik Conference on Responsible Fisheries in the Marine Ecosystem. In a document adopted by the Conference, States declared that they would incorporate ecosystem considerations into fisheries management with the aim of reinforcing responsible and sustainable fisheries in the marine ecosystem. This Reykjavik Declaration is a landmark contribution of the fisheries nations to the World Summit on Sustainable Development. We trust that we will see the spirit of the Declaration reflected in the results of the World Summit in Johannesburg. is why The time has come for a unified effort by political leaders, as well as by civil society and the private sector, to reverse the trend of marginalization and underdevelopment. That the International Conference on Financing for Development, to be held in Mexico next year, offers an unprecedented opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of millions of people throughout the developing world. The outcome of the Conference should focus on the great challenge of poverty eradication, as well as on how the developed and developing countries should be shared. We should, however, never lose sight of each States primary responsibility for its own development. The importance of responsible national governance and respect for human rights cannot be overstated. responsibilities between My focus, like that of many speakers before me, has been on the fight against international terrorism. Fighting international terrorism involves all States and international as well as regional organizations. We 21 must concentrate on the available instruments of each organization and find ways to adjust them as necessary. Furthermore, we need to ensure consistency and complementarity of international efforts. The malicious acts of 11 September and the latest shocking news of the suspicion of biological terrorism demonstrate that all of our concerted efforts are not only necessary but also crucial to fulfilling our duty to protect the lives of our citizens. The United Nations was founded to preserve peace and to work for a better world. Terrorists are fighting against everything the United Nations stands for. Fighting against them means fighting for the United Nations, for the future of our civilization and for all humankind. "}}
