{"speech":{"0":" I congratulate you, Sir, on your well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly. You are a worthy representative of the Republic of Korea, a country very close to my own through our important ties of friendship and cooperation. I also congratulate your predecessor on the highly efficient and responsible way in which he oversaw the work of the previous session of the Assembly. The Government of Ecuador received with special satisfaction the news of the award of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations and the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan. We congratulate the Secretary-General on this well-deserved recognition of his work, which has promoted among Member States the benefits of international association and solidarity. This session of community. The the Assembly began in an atmosphere of profound distress for all members of the international terrible terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September are shocking to the human conscience. Those whose perverse and irrational actions took the lives of thousands of innocent people — including many Ecuadorians — committed a grave attack on international peace and security. tragically From this rostrum, I wish to affirm to the people and the Government of the United States of America the profound condolences and solidarity of the people and this immense reiterate our strongest condemnation of those criminal acts, which have done the Government of Ecuador tragedy and following to 20 violence to all peoples, as well as to universal principles and values. the action of That is why Ecuador — a peace-loving country convinced of the predominant role of the United Nations as the key institution for decisions affecting the world — praises the General Assembly and the Security Council in response to terrorism, particularly the Councils adoption of resolution 1373 (2001), which contains the guidelines for all Member States to work urgently and in concert to prevent and suppress terrorist acts. Likewise, the international community must conclude negotiations on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism to strengthen the relevant judicial framework with concrete measures to prevent, sanction and combat this scourge. Ecuador is committed at the national, regional and international levels to the fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. In the final years of the twentieth century, great changes took place in the world, which led to new international trends, especially in terms of the process of globalization and threats to international peace and security. The developing countries, such as my own, began adapting their national structures to deal with the demands of a decidedly competitive environment. However, it must be said that it is obvious that the adjustments and changes those countries have made to their policies and strategies are not enough in themselves to achieve complete results as long as the structural causes of the disparity between the level of development of highly industrialized economies and that of economies in need of capital and advanced technology persist. That disparity continues to widen because of financial difficulties caused by unstable short-term capital flows, persistent external debt and obstacles to truly international trade. signs There are that current international economic trends are far from providing the equilibrium and justice needed to overcome the unfavourable burdens inherited from the twentieth century. Poverty has grown at alarming rates in all regions. International organized crime has exacerbated violence and insecurity in society. Massive international migration towards developed regions continues to increase. These phenomena, along with many others, result from the lack of real, universal agreements the development of human beings. to assist The problems that the world faces today respect no national borders. They are threats demanding not unilateral action but responses based on solidarity and concerted action. That interdependence is what enabled the heads of Government and State, at the Millennium Assembly, to agree on making the United Nations, the supreme multilateral forum, a suitable and effective instrument to fight for the development of all peoples of the world; to fight against poverty, ignorance and disease; to fight against injustice, violence, terror and crime; and to fight against the deterioration and destruction of the planet. They also committed themselves to freeing all people from the scourge of war, to eradicating the dangers posed by weapons of mass destruction and to strengthening respect for the rule of law in national and international affairs. the peaceful settlement of Ecuador, as a country that believes in and practices international disputes, regrets and condemns conflicts between States, as well as those within States caused by civil war, ethnic conflict or other reasons. The Government of Ecuador is concerned by the uncontrolled violence occurring between the peoples of Palestine and Israel, which continues to reap a tragic harvest of death and destruction. We recognize the right of the Palestinian people to a free and independent State, as well as the State of Israels right to exist within secure and internationally recognized borders. Ecuador reiterates its appeal to both parties to quickly return to peace negotiations. Last August, Ecuador assumed the presidency of in Geneva. Its the Conference on Disarmament leadership is guided by its profound commitment to the cause of general and complete disarmament under effective international control, which would make it possible to foster peace and confidence among nations. intensification of a phenomenon as old as humanity itself, undoubtedly linked to the historical development of civilization. I am referring to the enormous challenge posed by the increase in human migration, especially from the countries of the South towards the North. We are witnessing the While migration has been positive in that it has contributed to fruitful exchange between various peoples and has deepened dialogue processes and mutual enrichment between diverse cultures, in most cases the reason for it stems from the individuals desire to seek better living conditions and broader economic prospects. We cannot think of human history without the constant and ever present phenomenon of migration, and the current era is no exception. In the present age of the globalization of markets and the possibility of a new round of multilateral trade negotiations in the World Trade Organization (WTO), the liberalization of the administration of services through the free movement of persons must be emphasized. Today many developing countries of the world, afflicted by the serious consequences of economic crisis and the prevalence of structural failures that are difficult to overcome, have become net producers of migrants, men and women who feel compelled to seek broader horizons legally. Ecuador is one of those countries because of the most serious economic crisis of its recorded history, exacerbated by external factors that the national development process. Internal and external factors merged in recent years, deepening this crisis, which we are overcoming in a positive way at enormous sacrifice. the momentum of changed in tends While migration terms of historic objectives, to be a positive phenomenon the consequences for individuals are painful and stir our conscience. Because of that, my country has taken a series of actions to protect the rights of migrants and their families. With the support of the International Organization for Migration, we have held several meetings in which the State and civil society have participated. They have enabled us, on the one hand, to have direct testimony about the serious problems of this group of individuals who have left their countries voluntarily to find better opportunities and, on the other hand, to obtain concrete commitments aimed at protecting and defending human rights. I wish to underline the transnational nature of the migration problem, which requires active cooperation between countries of origin and countries receiving immigrants, as well as international bodies. In this context, I am happy to point out that Ecuador and Spain signed an agreement aimed at regulating migration, which undoubtedly has been beneficial for migrant citizens and signatory countries. Ecuador appeals to all Governments and sectors of civil society, but particularly to those of the developed world — receivers of migrant workers - to redouble their efforts aimed at protecting the rights of a non- this vulnerable sector of society in 21 discriminatory way, conscious of all the positive and fruitful aspects that the migration phenomenon brings to as demonstrated by European history of recent centuries and the integration of the Americas into the West. the general development of countries, If the twentieth century was the stage for some of the greatest humanitarian tragedies recorded by history, it is true that in that period we also witnessed the birth of a new global awareness of the urgency to protect and promote human rights and to preserve mans home, land and environment. My country has fully assumed this global challenge. We are signatories to the main instruments on this important item at both the international and the hemispheric level, and we have national tools that enable us to achieve such objectives. The National Plan on Human Rights, adopted as a State policy in June 1998 by civil society and the State, is perhaps the most innovative and visionary instrument that has been developed in our country. We hope that it will enable us to promote a real culture of tolerance and respect between the ethnic, social and cultural groups of our society. With this plan, Ecuador also complied with the mandate of the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. in July 2001 by In keeping with all the above-mentioned points, Ecuador places importance on one of the mandates of the Carabobo Act, signed the Presidents of the Andean Community of Nations, and has begun work on a draft Andean Charter of Human Rights, aimed at consolidating the ideas of respect for and the promotion of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual in the specific areas of culture and ethnic plurality characteristic of the Andean subregion. Ecuador was a pioneer in this important matter when, in 1980, within the subregional framework, it spurred on the adoption of the Riobamba Charter, which includes among its postulates the protection of human international obligation of all States and the condition that legitimate joint action carried out in protecting such rights must not violate the principle of non-intervention. Within this same context, Ecuador signed the Rome Statute of the International Court of Justice of July 1998, and it is taking measures for its prompt ratification. rights as an Turning to the WTO and the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), there is no doubt that one of the most important items on the foreign policy agenda of 22 States is international economic relations. Ecuador wishes to express some views on this, at the moment when the Fourth WTO Ministerial Conference is taking place in Qatar. Ecuador deems it fundamental to pursue the process of opening up trade, reducing tariffs and eliminating unnecessary trade barriers. However, my country also shares the doubts of some developing countries about the advantages of launching a new round of multilateral trade negotiations when the commitments of the Uruguay Round have not yet been fully implemented, particularly those relating to the reduction and the elimination of agricultural subsidies and to agreement on special and differential treatment provisions in favour of developing countries. These are priority items of interest for Ecuador, as is the expansion of openness in agricultural trade. We emphasize the necessary reform required by the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding to strengthen the implementation regime of the decisions of the relevant ad hoc groups and the appeals body. For example, Ecuador was never able the compensation to which it was entitled, in spite of having won the banana dispute in all the proceedings before the WTO Dispute Settlement Body and an arbitration award of $201.4 million annually, the amount of the damages caused to my country by an illegal import, sales and distribution scheme of that product in Europe. to obtain Given our own experience in this dispute, we believe that compensation must be binding, if we are really speaking about free markets in the full sense of the word, and that retaliatory measures in the same sector or in cross-sectors is not sufficient to repair the damages caused, particularly to the economies of developing countries. It would also be worth evaluating increasing other technical cooperation, as a European country is proposing at this time with respect to Ecuador. types of compensation, such as Progress in trade negotiations and the fulfilment of commitments already made will make it possible for us to have an international economic and financial climate conducive to investment and to growth of the world economy, which will make a positive contribution to social and human development. These same proposals give us hope in the negotiations of the FTAA — the Trade Negotiations Committee of which Ecuador is currently president. Our efforts take into account the various positions of countries, as well as their different levels of development and sizes of their economies, since we must seek consensus on decisions in a way that makes all the parties involved feel that their interests are guaranteed. For least developed countries, the establishment of a hemisphere-wide free- trade zone poses a challenge and at the same time offers an exceptional opportunity to be fully integrated into world economy in this new phase. resulting from disproportionately I turn next to the question of external debt and development financing. The enormous limitations faced by heavily indebted developing countries such as Ecuador, large external-debt servicing costs and from persistent obstacles to marketing our exports, work against national efforts to engender economic stability and sustainable development. Ecuadors total external debt now stands at about 64 per cent of our gross domestic product and nearly 40 per cent of our national budget; this has a negative impact on the financing of social development projects. External debt is mortgaging the economic present and future of developing countries; it has extremely adverse effects because it devours vast resources that would otherwise be used in the fight against poverty, in promoting public health and education, and in meeting many other urgent social needs. The situation thus has an increasing negative effect on market-oriented national policies and the political and democratic stability of many countries. It is therefore time for the international community fair, lasting, development-oriented measures so as to make progress in easing this serious problem — a problem that highly indebted medium-income countries too are facing. to adopt effective, on Conference Ecuador attaches the greatest importance to the International for Development to be held next March at Monterrey. It will be a good opportunity to define, from the financing perspective, a new kind of world cooperation that will effectively support development, especially the development of the countries of the South. Financing I am pleased to announce the conclusion and signature of an agreement between the World Meteorological Organization and the Government of Ecuador on the establishment at Guayaquil of an international centre for research on El Nino. I urgently appeal to the United Nations and its specialized to the international community and agencies, to international and regional financial institutions for resolute cooperation to ensure that the centre begins its work promptly. support Finally, as an Ecuadorian, I wish to address the question of the Colombian conflict. I wish to say that my country is following closely the internal political conflict in Colombia and the unfolding of a peace process in that country. In conformity with our policy of promoting dialogue and negotiation as the best way to overcome problems, we have frequently stated our unreserved political the Colombian Governments efforts to reach a negotiated peace with armed its country. Ecuador applauds the peace initiatives of President Andres Pastrana and expresses the hope that they will be meet with a matching response from those groups. Peace in Colombia is a top priority throughout the Americas; it should also be a top priority for the international community. It is in the interest of all to help ensure that the Colombian conflict does not spread to the rest of the subregion. irregular groups operating for in to that gives rise the Colombian border; Ecuador has committed itself to a broad and imaginative programme of development for our areas near these are aimed at substantial improvements in the living conditions of the inhabitants, with a view to eliminating the severe poverty the violence of drug trafficking. That programme has recently received major backing from international community through the advisory group set up last month at Brussels. I appeal to our brethren and neighbours in Colombia to join with us in similar programmes. I urgently appeal too to developed countries to continue to cooperate with such initiatives, which in the final analysis are the best way to guarantee peace and security. the jointly and in solidarity. This The challenges facing mankind at the outset of tackled by all twenty-first century must be the the countries, beginning of a new era for major international decisions. The world Organization is the forum in which we can carry out a vast mission: equitably to solve global problems and to buttress collective security. Ecuador again commits to work ceaselessly to attain those noble goals. itself is Mr. Belkhadem (Algeria) (spoke in Arabic): This session is taking place at a time when there is a new 23 international awareness of the global nature of problems of peace, security and development. The barbaric terrorist attacks against the United States on 11 September, and their alarming consequences, made it clear that terrorism is now a factor for worldwide political and economic destabilization. Algeria has conveyed its deepest sympathy to the families of the victims of those horrible acts. It did so with all the more sincerity and feeling because for more than a decade Algeria itself has been enduring the horrors of terrorism. The international reaction to this devastating scourge has been a heartening collective wake-up call. Mobilization and multifaceted action to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is now worldwide. In that regard, Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) unquestionably constituted a major breakthrough. It was adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter and obliges all States unequivocally and dutifully their they may be. supporters and sponsors, wherever Algeria is fully cooperating with the international community in the implementation of that universal collective endeavour. Algeria stresses how important it is that the resolution be strictly implemented and reaffirms the imperative need for universal adherence to existing international anti-terrorism instruments and for the ratification of relevant regional instruments. Algeria believes, inter alia, that the adoption of a comprehensive convention is essential. For its part, my country is ready to cooperate with other nations to achieve this as quickly as possible. terrorist activities and to combat to outlaw terrorism The dangers that terrorism poses to global peace and security highlight the need for a ruthless struggle against it, in particular through dismantling bases and networks, draining sources of financing, cooperating in exchanging proper equipment to countries that are victims of terrorism, and reviewing permissive national legislation regarding the right of asylum as well as the justification for murder or planning criminal activities to be committed in third countries. information providing and While the urgency of this struggle has made it possible to achieve notable progress in a few weeks, we must be unanimous in our determination if we are to confront the roots of terrorism — that is, we must address the problems that constitute a breeding ground for extremism and intolerance throughout the world. This means that Islam, a religion of peace and 24 tolerance, cannot in any way be associated with terrorism, which its values. It also underscores the importance of ensuring that the anti- terrorist struggle is not aimed at any one country, religion, culture or civilization. is alien to to self-determination, The United Nations, which has often diagnosed and analysed the state of our world, has rightly emphasized that problems tend to be of an economic, political and social nature and that their causes are both national and international. The denial of the right of peoples exacerbated phenomena of exclusion and poverty, the persistence of economic imbalances, the intensification of social inequalities, the environment and the pursuit of the arms race are all problems awaiting solutions and concrete measures that, in many cases, United Nations forums have already defined and adopted in many cases adopted. the continued deterioration of the The commitments undertaken recently to make globalization a factor of integration rather than of exclusion — in particular the objectives enshrined in the Millennium Declaration — take on full importance here, since they highlight the urgent need for effective measures to build a stable and united world on a solid foundation. Today, reality amply demonstrates that globalization, despite its enormous potential and opportunities, has not yet yielded the expected results with regard to the universal improvement of living conditions. The processes to which it leads have too often widened the existing cracks within societies and exacerbated differences among nations. This has encouraged marginal groups to exploit the difficult social situations to which many peoples are subject and to promote isolationism and rejection of the other. The Declaration and Plan of Action adopted by the Durban World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance provide a framework for inspiration and action to build more harmonious and fraternal relations among people. First of all, there is a need at the United Nations level to set aright unacceptable situations of injustice and denial of rights. In Palestine, the serious situation that prevails as a result of the continued Israeli occupation and its oppressive practices requires the attention of the entire international community. It demands urgent action to put an end to the daily trials of the Palestinian people, who are subjected to a deliberate policy by the Israeli army of intimidation, abuse and murder. This policy is likely to endanger the resumption of the peace process, taking the entire region to the brink of a conflagration with incalculable consequences. the Palestinian people and Given the situation, Algeria reaffirms its total solidarity with their inalienable right to an independent State with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital. Algeria urgently calls upon the international community to ensure the protection of the Palestinian people by sending international observers to the region. Algeria wishes to emphasize that only a solution based on international legality — in particular Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) — as well as on the principle of land for peace, adopted at the Madrid Conference, can ensure just and lasting peace and security for all the peoples of the region, as Chairman Yasser Arafat indicated in his speech this morning. Algeria would also like to reaffirm its solidarity with the brotherly peoples of Syria and Lebanon for the restoration of their lands still under Israeli occupation. In addition, Algeria welcomes the decision of the Security Council to lift the sanctions on the brotherly people of Sudan and seizes the opportunity to renew its appeal for the lifting of the sanctions on the brotherly Iraqi and Libyan peoples. The situation in the Western Sahara, where the settlement process has been halted for more than a year and a half, is also a source of great concern and a factor of instability in the Maghreb and in Africa as a whole. The United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) has not been able to continue the implementation of the settlement plan of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), though it had been accepted by the two parties to the conflict, the Kingdom of Morocco and the Frente Popular para la Liberacion de Saguia el- Hamra y del Rio de Oro (POLISARIO), in particular because of the many challenges that followed the identification stage. Action by the United Nations in the Western Sahara, carried out through MINURSO since 1991, should be commended, and the progress made within the framework of the implementation of the settlement plan — in particular the identification of the electoral body — should be maintained and consolidated. Here, the two parties should be reminded of their obligation to cooperate openly and sincerely with MINURSO, to conclude the referendum process and to call upon the bodies of the United Nations that deal with this issue to strictly respect their mandate. The unswerving position of Algeria on the issue of the Western Sahara stems from its dedication to international legality and to respect for the right of people to self-determination. Algeria therefore supports the holding of a free and transparent referendum, organized by the United Nations that will allow this people to decide on its destiny. Any effort or initiative to settle that dispute must be part of the framework of international the resolutions on decolonization adopted by the General Assembly. in particular, of legality and, the African continent, Elsewhere on the determination of African peoples and leaders and the support of the international community are starting to bear fruit in the areas of conflict prevention and settlement. The Peace Agreement concluded in Algiers in June 2000 between Ethiopia and Eritrea put an end to a devastating two-year war between those two brotherly African countries and opened the way to a peaceful settlement of their dispute. The progress made since the full deployment of the United Nations Mission the commitment of those two countries to strengthening the basis for a lasting peace and for mutually beneficial cooperation. in Ethiopia and Eritrea attests to Similarly, the implementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement, which has long been plagued by numerous difficulties, is now well under way. The international community must pursue its efforts to make to facilitate the inter-Congolese dialogue. the settlement process irreversible and Africa also welcomes the progress made in Sierra Leone in the implementation of its disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes, which have been made possible by the courageous and determined action of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone. Despite the positive developments that have occurred in Angola there, UNITA continues to sow death and destruction among the people of that country. A return to security will require strict respect by all States for the punitive measures laid down by the Security Council against UNITA. 25 Finally, regarding recent events in Burundi, my country welcomes the decision of the parties to the conflict there to establish a transitional Government that guarantees the participation of all the inhabitants of that country in the management of their own affairs. We hail the important role played by Mr. Nelson Mandela in achieving understanding among the parties in Burundi in the implementation of the Arusha Agreement. The end of the cold war eased the climate of suspicion and distrust that permeated international relations and was replaced by a measure of optimism based on new prospects. We hope that this optimism will signal an end to outdated doctrines and theories of nuclear deterrence and the balance of terror and that it will open the way to a bold approach to guaranteeing the security of all States. Given this qualitative transformation in international relations, our hope of seeing our planet forever free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction indeed strengthened. is initiatives The need to establish renewable international cooperation based on mutual interests and shared duties and responsibilities is more urgent than ever before. This new spirit must become an incentive for launching comprehensive genuine understanding of the problems plaguing the entire world. In brief, we must prepare for international governance that truly reflects the requirements of rationality, democratic participation and responsibility, without which any discussion of a new world order is meaningless and of no use to humanity. transparency, justice, to seek a the days ago and International Conference on Financing for Development, to be held in a few months in Mexico, are promising prospects for the lasting resumption of growth in the developing countries and for improving the living standards of their peoples. Four months ago, African countries, meeting at the 37th Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity in Lusaka, clearly expressed Africas official response to the new needs and aspirations of its peoples through their solemn launching of the transitional process towards the African Union and their adoption of the New African Initiative. These steps form an integral part of the reform process undertaken over the past few years by the African countries at the national, regional and continental levels to bring Africa into step with an ever-changing world. Aware of the magnitude of the challenges facing the continent and of the need to acquire a global integrated programme for the social and economic recovery of the continent, African leaders at the Lusaka summit adopted a plan that was conceived by and for Africa. Algeria, which actively participated in the creation and drafting of the New Partnership for African Development, believes that this programme will open the economic and social problems of Africa. Thus, in order for our Organization to bolster its credibility and effectiveness, to address the great changes on the international scene and to be more responsive to the aspirations of this global village, it must earnestly pursue its transformation and be more open to the world and to itself. to practical solutions the way to The progress that has been achieved at the political and economic levels in several regions and countries must be consolidated and enhanced through the international promotion of good governance. In this respect, the direct and indirect threats to sustainable development that jeopardize the survival of our planet require us all to mobilize on a vast scale in the context of the World Summit on Sustainable Development. Urgent measures must be taken to halt the devastating effects of various means and types of production and consumption that have become untenable. These must be transformed in a qualitative way, taking into account the needs of mankind as a whole. In the same vein, the ministerial conference of the World Trade Organization that opened in Doha two It is also necessary to ensure greater democracy and fairness within the United Nations system, in particular in the maintenance of international peace and security. The Security Council incontestably requires a drastic reform of its processes and membership. In a word, the United Nations must serve the great family of mankind as a whole. "}}
