{"speech":{"0":" Ethiopia has only one strategic enemy. Eritrea is not that enemy; the enemy I am referring to is poverty and backwardness. We therefore want to use all our resources, both human and material, to fight poverty. However, we cannot do so if we have a neighbour whose leadership is unable — as it has been to date — to move from being just a guerrilla movement to building a State, with all the responsibilities that that involves. The leadership in Eritrea, which is mired in a serious internal crisis, is resorting once again to actions that may lead us to unnecessary conflict. It wants to cover up its internal problems by externalizing them. But as far as Ethiopia is concerned, we are determined not to give them that chance. The Foreign Minister of the Eritrean Government said earlier that Ethiopia had failed to comply with the Algiers peace Agreement between the two countries. I should like to make just one or two points concerning the Algiers Agreement, which brought about the ceasefire in that unnecessary conflict. Last March, Ethiopia signed what is referred to as a status-of-forces agreement with the United Nations. As I speak, Eritrea has still not done likewise. Ethiopia has allowed free movement for the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE), but Eritrea has not. The most recent UNMEE statement confirms that fact. They talk about prisoners of war; it was only last week that, through the International Committee of the Red Cross, scores of Eritrean prisoners of war were released. They talk about the temporary security zone; although it has been established, it is not functional, and they put the blame on Ethiopia. There is a saying in some parts of Ethiopia that the mother gets the blame for the fathers actions. I am not, of course, trying to say that we are the mother — that is just a saying. But in our societies, women and mothers are always blamed for the faults of men and husbands. The Agreement has not been functional, as it should have been, because, under its terms, Eritrea was allowed to have a reasonable number of police and militia. The militia, by the way, are groups of peasants and farmers who are armed in order simply to protect their villages; they are not supposed to be armed to the teeth with mechanized vehicles and all sorts of heavy weapons. Hence, Ethiopia has said — we informed the Security Council forces numbering in the thousands are in the temporary security zone, which was established under the Agreement to separate the forces. Today our two forces are not separated. We are face to face along several areas of the front, so I do not understand how we can still call it a temporary security zone. It is not functional, as it should be, because the other side, which has been allowed to maintain its police force and militia, have used that pretext to bring in regular forces. today — regular that I would like to provide another example. The unfortunate policies of the leadership of that State have continued to put the people of that country and the region in a very dangerous situation by continuing to arm and to conscript people, whereas, to date, on our side, we have demobilized over 64,000 troops. We have not, in fact, heard about or seen anything from the other side. All we know is that they are increasing their forces, so that almost 10 per cent of their population of 3.5 million is now under arms. What is the purpose of that? It is certainly not a group of armed men going on a picnic. The Foreign Minister talked about a direct air route between Addis Ababa and Asmara being sabotaged or subvented by Ethiopias refusal to put it into operation. At one time we proposed — and the United Nations accepted — the idea of providing alternatives to the route that was initially suggested. That route was the one used by our airlines when the two countries were one, and it passed over heavily populated towns. One of those towns, Mekelle, was bombed in the early part of the conflict in 1998, and more than 50 schoolchildren were killed. That is why we do not want that direct route to be used. We suggested — and the United Nations accepted — the idea of changing the flight path to anywhere east or west of the original route. At one time the United Nations came up with a detour that would have added less than two minutes; it was rejected by the other side. So we are saying, here in the Assembly, that Ethiopia will accept all routes except one, whereas they are saying that they will reject all routes except one. I leave that issue to the judgement of the Assembly. that was mentioned was the question of Ethiopias having to submit operationally useful information on minefields. We were actually the first to submit the information on minefields. We submitted all that we have. What more could be asked of someone who says, “We do not have any more information”? We cannot give something that we do not have. The United Nations has accepted that, for its own good reasons. Of course, for propaganda purposes, the other party to this unfortunate conflict wants to go after it. But there is no more minefield information that we have or can submit, and the United Nations has accepted that. Another failed issue Finally, I just want to say that the war was imposed on us. Of course, they denied that, until the Organization of African Unity organized a fact-finding mission and the former United States Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, in a report to Congress, stated who started it. But more devastatingly, their own last week confirmed that it was by order of their President that Ethiopia was invaded. former Defence Minister So I would say that Ethiopia, like before, wants peace in order to concentrate on alleviating poverty. We were doing precisely that before we were invaded and during the conflict and have done so since its end. In fact, as one example, this year alone we registered 8.5 per cent growth in our gross domestic product. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund figure for that same period is 8 per cent. 19 We desire to continue along this route. It is Ethiopias hope that we will be allowed to do so and that the other party — in this case, the Eritrean leadership — will heed our advice that we concentrate on working to alleviate the poverty that in fact marks both countries, and that we work for our peoples and on the peace process and not pay mere lip service to it. Mr. Zackheos (Cyprus): I am taking the floor in exercise of my right of reply to the statement delivered on 12 November 2001 by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey, Mr. Ismail Cem, who, regrettably, did not hesitate to engage once more in the well-known rhetoric, replete with threats and misrepresentations, concerning the situation in Cyprus. Mr. Cem expressed the well-known exceptions to the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, referred to the so-called realities on the island and misrepresented the position of President Clerides with regard to the proposal made by leader, Mr. Denktash, for face-to-face negotiations. the Turkish Cypriot Let me make a few things clear. First, the accession of Cyprus to the European Union is a process that involves the European Union and the Republic of Cyprus. I remind Mr. Cem that the European Union has clearly established that no third party has a right to veto Cyprus accession, which will be based on the merits of its case. The European Commission, the European Union member States and the United Nations Security Council have made it abundantly clear that there is no legal obstacle to the membership of Cyprus to the European Union. Membership does not constitute union with another State and thus does not violate the provisions of the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee, as claimed by Turkey. Secondly, realities are the so-called rights violations those stemming from a clear violation of international law by the Republic of Turkey with its invasion, subsequent occupation and policy of ethnic cleansing inflicted on the Greek Cypriot population, along with an array of human that have been clearly documented and led the European Court of Human Rights to issue its landmark decision of 10 May 2001 in the case of Cyprus v. Turkey, finding Turkey in violation of articles 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights and articles 1 and 2 of its Protocol No. 1. The so-called realities of which Mr. Cem speaks are nothing more than the faits accomplis created by Turkey in Cyprus through the use of force and based on the forceful separation of the two 20 communities of the island in pursuit of secessionist aims. expressed Security Council Thirdly, with regard to the letters exchanged between President Clerides and Mr. Denktash, I wish to inform the Assembly that President Clerides responded immediately, on 8 November 2001, explaining that a tete-a-tete meeting in Nicosia would be a good idea immediately after the acceptance by both sides of the United Nations Secretary-Generals invitation to talks. Let me recall that, on 5 September, Mr. Denktash refused the invitation of the Secretary-General to resume the process which he had abandoned a year earlier. The its disappointment on 26 September this year at the unjustified rejection of the invitation by the Turkish side. President Clerides wrote to Mr. Denktash that they should not be abandoning the mission of good offices of the Secretary-General and the process in which he and his Special Representative are involved. Following a response from Mr. Denktash on 12 November, in which he indicated that his aim was not to abandon the mission of good offices, President Clerides expressed his readiness to have direct talks in the presence of the representative of the Secretary- General the Secretary-General informed of what is being discussed and what progress is being made, so that the Secretary-General would in turn report to the Security Council. We are not yet aware of any response from Mr. Denktash, but we express the hope that he will now display the necessary political will and seriously engage in negotiations in good faith to find a just and lasting settlement to the Cyprus problem within the parameters set by the Security Council resolutions. in order to keep Mr. Tekle (Eritrea): I shall respect the dignity of the General Assembly by refraining from the purple language employed by the Permanent Representative of Ethiopia. I also have no intention of engaging in issues that are not germane to the statement of the Foreign Minister of Eritrea. I am not here on a propaganda campaign and I shall be brief and focus on only two or three issues, if only because I addressed yesterday, in another exercise of the right of reply, most of the issues raised by the Permanent Representative of Ethiopia. Also, I shall not engage in a discussion of the internal problems of a country, if only because this is in the public domain. The newspapers and the web sites will tell you what has been going on in Ethiopia over the last six or seven months. One should take the mote out of ones eye before talking about the chaff in someone elses. We heard that the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) has been happy with the information given to it by Ethiopia with respect to landmines. Now I shall read what the Special Representative of the Secretary-General said in regard to that when asked about it in one of his interviews: “We are pressuring everybody to give us landmine information. Eritrea has given us records for mines. Ethiopia has given us several hundred maps. We have never hidden the fact that we have been persuading Ethiopia to continue to cooperate with us in order that we can get all the records, all the maps, all the information they have so we know where these mines are, so people can live there safely.” Now the Ethiopian Government does not want to give the necessary information on landmines for a simple reason: it does not want the people who have been displaced by this aggression to go back to their villages and their farms. The issues of the police and militia and of demobilization were also handled by my delegation yesterday. The second issue concerns the direct air route between Addis Ababa and Asmara that had been requested by UNMEE. UNMEE proposed an air route. We accepted it; Ethiopia rejected it. Ethiopia claims that it has offered alternative routes. First, contrary to what had been asserted, these alternative routes are not deviations of an insignificant quantity. They are deviations of 10 to 15 minutes, and 8 minutes in one direction. This information was given to the Security Council by the Eritrean delegation this morning. Secondly, what the Ethiopian Government is proposing are the routes that these planes had taken to attack the Port of Massawa, kill people, bomb the electricity supply and Asmara itself, using a route from which they hit civilian centres and the airport, where one of the pilots, Colonel Bezabeh Petros, was captured.
