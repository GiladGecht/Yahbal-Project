{"speech":{"0":" First, may I congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election to preside over the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I assure him that he has the Hungarian delegations full support in the effective fulfilment of his tasks and high responsibility. At the same time, I wish to thank Mr. Harri Holkeri for the much appreciated work that he carried out in his capacity as President of the preceding session of the General Assembly. days have elapsed since Sixty-three 11 September. More than 80 nations are in mourning today, mourning the absurd deaths of their compatriots, men and women from all over the world and representing different and various traditions, cultures, beliefs and ethnic origins. Approximately 6,000 people perished as a result of heinous terrorist attacks in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania, and we remember the victims in our prayers and extend our deep sympathy and compassion to their families and friends. These attacks were committed against the entire civilized world and against fundamental human values. The Security Council and the General Assembly very quickly took firm and clear measures in order to defend the universal interests of the international community. To this end, an effective global coalition was created in which Hungary, side by side with many other countries, is proudly participating. Those who perpetrated and supported these terrorist attacks are trying to depict their acts, as well as the reaction of legitimate self- defence to those acts, as a war of religion. Clearly it is nothing of the sort. There can be no justification for these acts, nor for any other terrorist activities anywhere else. In fact, international terrorism pursues political objectives and is trying to undermine our multi-ethnic to exacerbate regional conflict, to pit various cultures one against another and to impose on us by force its own order of hatred and fanaticism. The nature of the challenge with which we are confronted is eminently strategic: first, because it calls into question the raison detre and endangers the very existence of our civilization; secondly, because the terrorist network, which is organizing against us, has managed to develop global capacities; and, lastly, because in the war that is declared against us, terrorism abides by no legal order and follows no rules. and multi-concessional world, We can welcome the fact that, on the basis of a convergence of interests, cooperation among States has acquired, in the two months following the terrible event, a dimension that is very promising and entirely new. But major combat against international terrorism will certainly not be short. Of course the military action launched against the Taliban regime and the terrorist Al Qaeda organization represent an important element, but not the only one, within the framework of international action. Within this struggle, the tasks that we have to carry out are complex and multifaceted. We have to do our utmost in the political, diplomatic, educational, legal, and also financial, humanitarian, economic and social areas to make sure that we, in the final analysis, emerge victorious from this struggle. We must recognize that in this struggle we have to redouble our efforts to promote the rule of law, to reject extremism, intolerance, discrimination and nationalistic tendencies and to intensify the global work that has to be accomplished in order to eradicate poverty and ensure sustainable development. The fight against terrorism is part and parcel of the general 17 framework of this global endeavour within which we are trying to build a better world. The terrorist attacks against the United States will probably be remembered as a turning point in our history, and also an opening to a new era. What is certain is that from now on humanity will not be able to continue in the same way as before. Governments have to shoulder major responsibility vis-a-vis this touches directly upon our challenge, which now everyday existence. The international community managed to find the most appropriate response by bringing together a coalition unprecedented in inter- State relations, the historic importance of which will certainly go far beyond our own era. Hungary stands ready, within the limit of its capacity, to take an active part in that coalition. the development of 12 the United Nations In the present situation, the United Nations is called upon to play a role of primary importance, to strengthen the effectiveness of international action. Through anti-terrorist conventions, already has contributed very significantly towards the development of a common framework of international law in the fight against terrorism. Through the adoption of other conventions, which are now being prepared, the legal framework will become even more comprehensive and general. However, in order to do that, we must make new efforts and, given the importance of what is at stake, and the fact that we have common goals, the groups of countries concerned should display a greater degree of flexibility. The United Nations should be able fully to play its role of enhancing the practical implementation anti-terrorist cooperation. international of the international In the wake of the terrorist attacks, a series of specific measures were implemented by my countrys Government. At level we have strengthened our cooperation, both political and legal, in the anti-terrorist area with our allies at NATO and our partners within the European Union (EU). We decided also to implement Security Council resolution 1373 (2001), and we will forward to the Committee that was established under the terms of that resolution a detailed report on the national measures undertaken by Hungary to fight terrorism. I should like to recall at this stage that Hungary is a party to most of the international, multilateral against terrorism. conventions 18 for the instrument of for As regards the two most recently passed United Nations conventions in this area, let me state that my country has just deposited today with the Secretary- General the ratification International Convention the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. I should like to announce that Hungary will sign the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism in the upcoming weeks. We are determined to become a party to that Convention as quickly as possible, so as to complement in international conventions that are universal in nature and deal with the fight against terrorism. Furthermore, my Government recently submitted to Parliament a draft law to strengthen national regulations in the areas of money-laundering and fighting terrorism. the Hungarian participation Hungary attaches very special importance to the success of the international humanitarian action in Afghanistan. Through the two Hungarian humanitarian organizations, which traditionally have played a role in the region, my Government has started to forward humanitarian assistance to the refugees and the Afghan population. Such assistance consists of foodstuffs and blankets for about 15,000 people. My Government is very deeply concerned at the danger represented by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. Our commitment in favour of multilateral control over such weapons remains unchanged and we participate in international efforts aimed at limiting and eliminating weapons of mass destruction. The tragic events of 11 September and the recent anthrax-related incidents make us realize the possible dramatic consequences of the absence of a reaction by the community of nations to the challenge presented by weapons of mass destruction, including biological weapons. We think that the strengthening of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction will enable the international community to act even more effectively against the intent to use biological agents for military objectives. The ad hoc group asked to work out measures for implementation managed to make notable progress in the almost seven years of its history, and is very near agreement. We regret that it could not finalize its work before the date of the Fifth Review Conference of the Convention. It is important that the Conference should leave aside the divergence of views it the should underscore with regard to the approach to the modalities of the long-term strengthening of the Convention, and that instead commitment undertaken by Member States to promote the integrity of the system of the prohibition of biological weapons. In its capacity as Chair of the Fifth Review Conference, Hungary would like to do its utmost in order to justify the hopes expressed by Member States and public opinion that specific results will emerge from the Conference. We would like actively to contribute that efforts aimed at strengthening the system of prohibition of biological weapons will also continue without interruption after the Conference. to making sure The Statute of the International Criminal Court is a political and legal document of capital importance. It translates into fact the historic aspiration we have had that those who commit the crimes of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity will not be allowed in future to act with impunity. Therefore, we warmly welcome the ratification of the Rome Statute by a rapidly growing number of countries, to date numbering more than 40. Within this context I wish to announce here that the Hungarian Parliament, by a resolution that was adopted almost unanimously, ratified the Statute on 6 November. The deposition of the instrument of ratification will take place in the course of this month of November. Hungary is working actively so as to ensure that the Court, this very important institution of our era, can start working in the near future. We should also make efforts to ensure that it will be universally accepted as soon as possible because only in that way will it be able to be successful in its work and effective in the area of maintaining peace and international security and effectively protecting international humanitarian law and human rights. Our world has changed and we all have to change with it. Unfortunately, when I say that I am not saying that earlier challenges have disappeared but rather that, in addition to the difficulties we already have, we are facing a new crisis think strategically and at the same time be very resolute in our action. The work that we have to carry out is therefore wider and broader and the only choice we have is to act on the basis of our human values in the interests of our civilization and future security. The United Nations is part and parcel of that endeavour. that compels us to therein contained the message The Millennium Declaration speaks of it with great eloquence and the events of 11 September only strengthen by underscoring the crucial nature of the times we live in, a crossroads between two centuries and two millennia. We are asked to provide answers to the global questions that haunt us and that have been continuously plaguing this world. The success or failure of our efforts to provide such answers will, without any doubt, affect the quality of life of the whole of the twenty-first century. It that my delegation wishes to provide its contribution to the success of the deliberations, held under the very special circumstances of the present session of the General Assembly. this spirit is in "}}
