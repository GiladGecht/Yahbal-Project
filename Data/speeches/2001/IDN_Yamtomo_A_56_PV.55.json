{"speech":{"0":" My delegation is taking the floor in exercise of the right of reply with regard to the concern referred to by the representative of Papua New Guinea. My delegation would like to state that the Government of Indonesia firmly believes that the case will be investigated, with the aim of bringing to justice those responsible, in accordance with Indonesian law. We therefore urge others to respect the investigation process and not to interfere in it. We wish to assure the representative of Papua New Guinea that this case will receive the full attention of the Government, as it involves its own citizens. I should also like to emphasize the fact that this case is a purely domestic issue for the Government of Indonesia"}}
