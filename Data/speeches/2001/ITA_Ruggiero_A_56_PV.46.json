{"speech":{"0":" I wish to congratulate the President on his election to head the first session of the General Assembly of the new millennium. I am certain that his experience and commitment will enable us to achieve the high goals that we all share. I also renew the Italian Governments warmest congratulations to Secretary-General Kofi Annan on his receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize. His appointment to a second term to the leadership of the United Nations is both welcome and unanimously appreciated. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belgium addressed the General Assembly yesterday, speaking on behalf of the European Union. Italy fully shares his views and supports his statement. Like our Belgian colleague and previous speakers, I would like to express once more, on this solemn occasion, to the Government and people of the United States our deep solidarity following the appalling terrorist acts perpetrated against them. We share their suffering over the shocking loss of human life and the sorrow of thousands of families. These acts defy the most basic values of civil coexistence. We condemn them and reaffirm our full commitment to the fight against international terrorism, a struggle on which the United Nations has conferred full legitimacy. We believe that the United Nations remains the central forum to which we must turn in drafting a comprehensive response to terrorism. This is why we need strict application of the full range of measures adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council during the days immediately following the 11 September attacks. Resolution 1373 (2001), in particular, must be implemented, urgently and vigorously. I also hope that everyone shows the necessary flexibility to allow a swift conclusion of the negotiations on a comprehensive convention against international terrorism. the Italian Parliament approved On 7 November, by a majority of more than 90 per cent, the Governments decision to contribute ground troops, naval forces and air units to operations against international terrorism. This confirms my countrys awareness that the stakes are high and proves the robustness of our national consensus in facing this challenge. The fight must be conducted in a targeted manner, avoiding the loss of innocent lives, until the objective has been fully achieved, without, however, neglecting humanitarian assistance the Afghan people, both within the country and in the refugee camps. But the problem of the political future of Afghanistan, a problem to be solved only by the Afghan people, must, of course, remain a high priority in the agenda of the United Nations, together with the objective of regional stability. to But in crafting a credible, diversified global strategy to eradicate international terrorism, we must also search for solutions to the most delicate regional crises and to the global problems that loom over our lives. These ignorance, inequality, underdevelopment, violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms and threats to the environment and health. include hunger, poverty, At the top of the list of regional crises is the Middle East, an area physically close to Italy, and one to which we pay close attention. Here, we are working both in a national capacity and within the European Union to create, as soon as possible, the conditions for an end to the violence and a true return to negotiations for a comprehensive, lasting peace in the region based on the establishment of a viable and democratic State for the Palestinians and an end to the occupation of their territories and on Israels right to live in peace and security within internationally recognized borders. This framework should also include an ambitious plan, like the one adopted to rebuild a devastated Europe in the wake of World War II, for public and private inter-regional assistance towards fostering solidarity among the regions States and peoples â€” in other words, a new Marshall Plan. Special attention should be paid to the economic and social growth and development of the Palestinian population, to which Italy is fully committed and for which it remains prepared to do more in the future. investments and In the Balkans, we have noted encouraging progress despite persisting tensions. Our goal there is to prevent destabilizing to foster regional cooperation and economic development, including closer ties with the European Union. tendencies and As for the challenges of globalization, we should first of all make the success of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Doha a primary objective. In fact, many of the global problems I have listed can be alleviated by ensuring that the international market economy and multilateral free trade operate foster inclusiveness, integration and more equitable and sustainable growth of all countries through agreed rules. This latest WTO round should be one of growth and development, the problems of least developed countries. the developing and in particular on focusing continue fairly and to The first objective But in order to assure a better response to globalizations most problematic aspects, other major objectives must be pursued. And the universal organization with the moral authority to meet this challenge is the United Nations. is the maintenance of international peace and security. Italys commitment is strong and long-standing. In fact, we are one of the top three contributors of men and resources to peace operations led and authorized by the United Nations. In this light, we appreciate the reports that the Secretariat has issued in the past two years, which suggest a vision of peace activity as a single, three-sided concept, encompassing conflict prevention, peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building. 25 safeguarding Italy also values the document that the Secretary- General submitted to Member States on the prevention of armed conflicts, emphasizing the direct connection between fighting underdevelopment. In fact, no peacekeeping action can achieve lasting results unless it is coupled with measures institutions, safeguard the human, civil and cultural rights of all communities and rebuild the economic and social fibre of affected areas. strengthen government peace and to The second objective is to foster development and eradicate poverty. We must ensure that all the countries of the world benefit from the opportunities created by interdependencies and progress, in particular in the areas of information and communication technology. The global United Nations conferences of the 1990s laid the groundwork for the definition of poverty as a multidimensional phenomenon. is not only characterized by low income and consumption, but also a and environmental stability. This is a vicious cycle that we must break, integrated initiatives. To reverse the downward spiral, we must enhance both the material and the human dimensions of development. through coordinated and food, health schooling lack of care, It the shouldering of The Millennium Declaration spells out the objectives to be attained by 2015. Italy has shown its commitment to these goals through the shaping of its international actions and its responsibilities during the year of its G-8 presidency. One example was the substantive outreach initiative at the Genoa Summit, involving a meeting with five African Heads of State and the Secretary-General to discuss the New African Initiative and launch a global fund infectious diseases. to combat HIAIDS and other Finally, we must continue to nurture and strengthen development assistance and reach the goal of having the most developed countries dedicate 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to this pursuit. In this context, debt relief is another essential tool to free up the necessary resources in developing countries in order to stimulate their economies, for instance by promoting public in health care and schooling. Italy is a leader in this field by virtue of recent laws that allow it to gradually cancel the debt of the poorest countries. investment 26 As I said before, the United Nations has the moral authority to take on todays new challenges. This fact was highlighted by the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Secretary-General and to the Organization as a whole. However, its structure and procedures must keep pace with the times. Italy believes in the reform of the United Nations, a reform that should affect all of its bodies, including the Security Council. Let me reiterate the need for a comprehensive reform that addresses the relevant issues in all their aspects. Such a reform should be designed to produce greater efficiency, legitimacy and transparency. It should also meet expectations of democracy, universality and inclusiveness. the general In addition, to create the conditions for stable growth of prosperity and security for all humankind, we need more effective governance of globalization. The documents prepared by the Secretariat make great strides in this direction. Now is the time to translate the commitments of into action. Italy will support every initiative undertaken for this purpose. the Millennium Declaration Never have we had a better opportunity to solve our problems, yet never have we faced greater risks. The answer does not lie in denying the reality of interdependence and growing globalization. It is within our ability the international system. Never before has the world had so many human, financial and technological resources at its disposal. The answer lies in our hands, in our collective will. to promote better governance of "}}
