{"speech":{"0":" I congratulate you, Sir, on your unanimous election as President of the fifty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly. I would also like to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary- General, for his re-election to a second term in office and for the richly deserved Nobel Peace Prize awarded to him and the United Nations Organization. This is an acknowledgement of his tireless efforts in the service of mankind and, as the Secretary-General has said, of a challenge to do better and, I hope, faster. I would like to assure the Secretary-General of my Governments cooperation and firm commitment in that regard. Finally, may I say that the good old days, before 11 September, are gone forever, and I shed a tear. The sad part is that we inherited a world that was good from our forefathers. Today, I ask, do we leave tomorrow a better world for our children and our childrens children? That I ask. Mr. President, we look to you for leadership on these vital issues. The achievements of the United Nations Organization are many and varied, while its increasing relevance in an ever more complex international environment is clear to us. Its objectives are still as valid and noble today as they were 56 years ago and, I believe, can only be achieved by our continued commitment, careful vigilance and firm action. Thank you. May God bless those in sorrow. May God bless the United States of America. And may God bless the United Nations. "}}
