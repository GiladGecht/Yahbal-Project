{"speech":{"0":" Before all else, on behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Korea, I wish to convey our deepest condolences and sympathy to the bereaved families and friends of those who lost lives in the horrendous terrorist attacks of 11 September. This unprecedented criminal act has posed a grave threat to international peace and security, as well as a serious challenge terrorist acts constitute a crime against humanity and civilization that cannot be justified by any cause. to human dignity. Such To forestall the recurrence of such incidents and to eradicate international terrorism, comprehensive and common efforts at the international level are urgently needed. The United Nations is expected to play an important role in these efforts. Immediately after the terrorist attacks in September, the Security Council and the General Assembly adopted resolutions denouncing terrorism and calling for measures for its elimination. This prompt action, as well as the ensuing debates at the United Nations, attest to the major role to be played by the Organization in the anti-terrorism effort. The Government of the Republic of Korea will continue to actively take part in the measures taken by the United Nations, including the implementation of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001), and will join the effort to free the international community from the scourge of terrorism. At the same time, we will spare no effort in rendering humanitarian assistance to the refugees who have been displaced as a result of the war against terrorism. Furthermore, in preparing to co-host the 2002 KoreJapan FIFA World Cup, we will do our utmost to ensure that the event is held in a secure atmosphere free from the threat of terrorism. I stand here with much reminiscence. The Republic of Korea, once one of the major recipients of United Nations assistance, is now an active contributor to the effort to realize the ideals and goals of this body. It is also the country whose Minister for Foreign Affairs had the honour of presiding over the first session of the General Assembly in the new century. The birth of the Republic and its development to United Nations thereafter owe a great deal 33 assistance. Indeed, the Government of the Republic of Korea was born from the United Nations-supervised elections held pursuant the United Nations resolution calling for an independent Government in Korea. During the Korean war, in the early 1950s, we were able to defend our country, thanks to the participation and noble sacrifice of the United Nations forces. to economic development After the war, as the Korean people strove to overcome the wars devastation, rebuild the country, achieve a democracy, upholding human found enormous strength and encouragement in the support and cooperation rendered by the United Nations. The Korean people will never forget this. We will redouble our efforts to do our share for the cause of global peace and prosperity, as enshrined in the Charter. rights, we emerge and Looking back on the Republic of Koreas arduous and eventful process of development over the past half century, we see that it is an exemplary case of all the good that can be achieved when the international community works closely with a people determined to overcome poverty and the legacy of conflict in order to build a better future for themselves. Ten years have passed since the simultaneous admission of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea to the United Nations. In the intervening decade, particularly during recent years, much progress has been made in inter-Korean relations. Taking this opportunity, I would like to briefly touch upon the peace process that is unfolding on the Korean peninsula — an effort for which we seek members continuing support. The first inter-Korean summit, held in June 2000, was truly a historic event for peace, not only on the Korean peninsula, but also in East Asia and indeed the world. Before the summit, the Korean peninsula had remained a lone island where the cold war maintained its foothold. The summit initiated the process of melting away that foothold — the icy wall of hostility and confrontation that had thickened between South and North Korea over the past half century. The whole world welcomed the breakthrough, expressing high hopes the Korean peninsula, as exemplified here by the joint statement of the co- chairpersons of the General Assembly resolution. the Millennium Summit and for peace on 34 Since then positive changes have taken place on the Korean peninsula. There have been three rounds of reunions by members of separated families. At the opening of the Sydney Olympic Games, the world was moved to see South and North Korean athletes march in together. The project to relink a railway and road between the two Koreas is now under way. The first South-North Defence Ministers meeting was held with a view to reducing tension and furthering peace. Meanwhile, North Korea has steadily expanded its diplomatic horizon, establishing diplomatic ties with most countries of the European Union and many others. Such endeavours have been strongly welcomed and supported by the Republic of Korea, which has striven to shore up global support for the Korean peace process. The goal of our sunshine policy of promoting engagement between South and North Korea is for the two sides to live together in peace and cooperation, in preparation for peaceful unification. The engagement policy is actively supported by the whole world, not to mention the Korean people and key neighbours surrounding the Korean peninsula. North Korea, too, embraced the spirit of peace, reconciliation and cooperation Joint Declaration of 15 June 2000 issued at the inter-Korean summit. The Government of the Republic of Korea will continue to do its utmost so that a lasting peace may take root on the Korean peninsula and global peace may be strengthened. We sincerely thank the United Nations and the encouragement they have given us so far. We shall continue to count on their steadfast support and cooperation. leaders of the world the for The work required of the United Nations in the twenty-first century is no less than daunting. Numerous tasks lie ahead of us, such as fostering international peace and security, promoting the common prosperity of the global village, advancing democracy and human rights, eradicating poverty, combating transnational crime, protecting the environment and enhancing human well-being. Rising to these challenges, world leaders gathered last year at the Millennium Summit to reconfirm their responsibilities and to chart a new course for the international community in the twenty-first century. The Millennium Declaration aims at materializing a new United Nations that can effectively meet the many challenges faced by the international community. It should be appreciated in particular that the Declaration sets concrete policy goals to free humanity from fear and poverty. Now the task before all States Members of the United Nations is to muster the best of their wisdom and implementing measures to fulfil the commitments outlined in the Millennium Declaration. The Republic of Korea will actively cooperate with all other Members, so that these commitments may be carried out faithfully. devising strength and in With the end of the cold war and the passing of the twentieth century, reconciliation and cooperation have come to define the tenor of the evolving global order. However, genuine global peace has yet to be obtained. In many corners of the globe, the threat of terrorism looms large, and conflicts and confrontations caused by ethnic, religious and economic factors still persist. Far worse, the greatest victims are often the most vulnerable groups, such as children, women and ethnic minorities. In this regard, I fully support the efforts of its capability to prevent and resolve conflicts and to deal with their aftermath. The conflict prevention and peacekeeping function of is essential for global peace, and the role of the United Nations in post-conflict peace-building should also be expanded. the United Nations the United Nations to strengthen Humanity in the twenty-first century is at the mercy of rapid and sweeping changes that are unprecedented in the history of human civilization. At the core of the vortex lie the information technology revolution and globalization. If we fail to meet the challenges posed by these trends, the promises of peace and prosperity in the twenty-first century will not be fulfilled. Member States of the United Nations must gather their collective wisdom and will so that all members of the international community can enjoy the benefits of globalization and revolutionary advances communication technology. information and the in Against this backdrop, President Kim Dae-jung proposed building a trans-Eurasia information network at the Asia-Europe Summit last year, with a view to galvanizing information exchange and cooperation between Asia and Europe to an unprecedented level. In order to narrow the information gap between nations, international assistance is required, particularly in building the information infrastructures and human resources of developing countries. In this regard, greater cooperation and attention on the part of the developed countries are essential. in Furthermore, the effective management of the global economy and poverty eradication the underdeveloped countries should be placed high on the agenda of global consultations. The visibility and transparency of global financial markets should be enhanced by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and other international financial organizations. functions of reinforcing the The next round of World Trade Organization (WTO) talks should be launched as soon as possible in order to strengthen free trade and the multilateral trading system. In this regard, I hope the International Conference on Financing for Development, to be held in March of next year, will succeed in devising a comprehensive plan to deal with issues related to poverty and development. We have to bear in mind the lesson drawn from history that fostering the middle- class through poverty eradication can lay a solid foundation for democracy. As far as the environment is concerned, international efforts to protect “Mother Nature” should be carried out in a more effective and substantial manner. In some advanced countries, the development of bio-technology has reached such astonishing levels as to arouse fear of infringing upon the realm of God. While acknowledging the positive role such scientific advancements may have in prolonging human life and improving the quality of life, we need to prevent them from being misused and from becoming an affront to human dignity. Democracy and human rights are universal values that must continue to be sought and upheld in the twenty-first century. In recent decades, democracy and human rights have claimed many victories around the world, but they have also suffered setbacks. Human rights continue to be abused in many parts of the world in illegal executions, discrimination and other violations. It is particularly distressing that large-scale and systematic violations of human rights persist in some regions of conflict. Such deplorable acts cannot be tolerated. I form of kidnapping and torture, the 35 sincerely hope that the second conference of the Community of Democracies, to be held in Seoul in October of next year, will prove to be a milestone in this regard. Humanity places great expectations upon the United Nations to meet the challenges of the twenty- first century and to make the most of the opportunities it brings, because this global body provides a unique forum for all the countries of the world together to seek solutions to common problems in the spirit of mutual respect and cooperation. To rise to the task, the United Nations requires ongoing reform. Its financial and organizational foundations must be strengthened in accordance with its expanding roles. In particular, the reform of the Security Council, given its importance to all Member States, must be achieved through general agreement, with a view to making the Council more representative, democratic and efficient. The United Nations must stand firmly at the centre of efforts to further spread and consolidate multilateralism around the world, based on the spirit of mutual understanding and compromise. Tolerance and dialogue must be upheld in international relations if we are to make the twenty-first century an era of shared prosperity and peaceful coexistence among diverse civilizations. capabilities, The Republic of Korea will strive to contribute to the further development of the United Nations in the spirit of repaying the generosity it has received from the international community. Befitting the countrys growing the Republic of Koreas contribution to the United Nations budget is to increase significantly in the coming years, in accordance with the new scale of assessments adopted last year. Next year, it will become the tenth largest contributor to the regular budget of the United Nations. With its troops now taking part in the Organizations peacekeeping missions in East Timor and three other places, the Republic of Korea will also continue to actively participate in the United Nations endeavours for peace and security. Furthermore, we will share our experiences in economic development and democratization with our neighbours in the global village and do what we can to bridge the gap between the developing and developed countries. I am convinced that the United Nations, on the strength of the concerted efforts of all countries 36 represented here, will continue to be a beacon of hope, lighting the road ahead for humanity in the twenty-first century.
