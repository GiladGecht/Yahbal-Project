{"speech":{"0":" Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly. I should also like to extend my congratulations to all the other members of the Bureau. I am sure that your prestige and acknowledged diplomatic skills will contribute to the successful work of the General Assembly at this session. I to to like also extend this Organization and sincere should congratulations to the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan. Mexico welcomes the fact that they were awarded this years Nobel Peace Prize. That is a well-deserved recognition of the dedication and clarity of vision that have marked the work of the Secretary-General. It fills us with hope regarding the efforts that this Organization will have to make in order to meet the international challenges of the twenty-first century. is in that I am addressing the General Assembly on behalf of the women and men of my country, Mexico — a country the process of a profound transformation, determined to strengthen democracy and development, as well as to take on greater responsibilities in shaping the new international system with a view to fostering the prosperity, peace and security that every inhabitant of the world deserves. Mexican society is firmly committed to making Mexico a country that contributes positively to the 16 worthiest objectives of human well-being. Aware that there is a diversity of views on ways to achieve this end, Mexico favours dialogue and agreement as benchmarks to guide our endeavours. For Mexico the United Nations is the best example of a global forum where the voices of all men and women can merge into a veritable concert of nations. This is a Mexico that today renews its full commitment to the United Nations — which not only demands full respect for the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, but that is also committed to the development of new, universally observed rules and standards for the regulation of international relations. This is a Mexico that acts firmly in the defence and protection of human rights and of democracy, at all times and in all places, beginning, of course, within our own territory, promoting full respect for fundamental freedoms on the basis of tolerance, plurality and equity. That is why my Government has initiated formal talks with the various political parties in Mexico in order to create favourable conditions for the promotion of a constitutional reform that will allow Mexico to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which our country signed last year. My Government has also started a necessary updating of Mexicos international obligations in the field of human rights and international humanitarian law. I have submitted for consideration by the Mexican Senate the ratification, accession or acceptance of 11 other legal instruments in areas such as the forcible disappearance of persons, the rights of the child, the elimination of discrimination against women and the protection of victims of international armed conflicts. This new commitment on the part of Mexico to the defence of human rights was also reflected in the recent release, for humanitarian reasons, of Rodolfo Montiel and Teodoro Cabrera, two environmental activists in Mexico. This effort in the field of human rights was also reflected in the broad disclosure of State security agencies files, which will contribute to increasing transparency regarding both present and past events, thus making it a central element of my administration. Mexico is taking concrete steps to demonstrate that its commitment to the norms of the international community is profound, sincere and resolute. threats The establishment of the United Nations more than 50 years ago was the triumph of hope and freedom over the suffering inflicted by the two world wars on humanity, Today, however, to peace and security do not emerge only from acts of aggression among States. The new threats also arise from internal conflicts that have cross-border effects, such as the massive movement of displaced peoples, humanitarian tragedies, grave violations of human rights and fundamental the exacerbation of nationalism and religious fanaticism. These threats also derive as transnational environmental degradation, AIDS, and, of course, terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. from worldwide organized phenomena crime, freedoms, and such There is no doubt that the magnitude and the cruelty of the 11 September attacks have underscored the vulnerability of States and the fragility of world peace. It is a matter of concern to us that terrorist groups can gain access to weapons of mass destruction and that they also benefit from the traffic in arms, organized and drug trafficking. crime, money laundering not only terrorism International flouts international law, but it also endangers the stability of the community of nations and economic development processes, increasing unemployment and preventing headway from being made in the alleviation of poverty. For this reason, Mexico categorically rejects any argument that seeks to justify terrorist activities. Nothing — not the justness of a cause, the inequality of forces with respect to an antagonist, poverty, or any other grounds — can justify resorting to violence for political ends. Mexico reiterates its commitment to the fight against terrorism and its decision to fully implement resolution 1373 (2001) of the Security Council, which establishes a fighting international terrorism and cutting its ties to practices such as money laundering and organized crime. series of measures for We are firmly committed to the fight against new threats to international peace and security. We believe that the international community should meet these challenges on the basis of three principles: first, the supremacy of the strengthening of international cooperation in resolving global problems; and the shaping of an international order based on universally observed rules the United Nations; secondly, thirdly, and standards that meet the needs and aspirations of the community of nations. The Government of Mexico is determined to assist in this effort. For that reason, Mexico feels deeply honoured to have been elected, after a 20-year absence, as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for 2002-2003. It wishes to express its deep commitment in this respect. We thank the international community express our determination to work actively and responsibly in favour of the maintenance of international peace and security. Our intention is that Mexicos participation in the Security Council will amplify the voices of countries that are not usually heard on the international scene. support and for its the lead Mexico taking a in promoting therefore calls on In the search for lasting solutions to the new threats now facing the international system, we must not fail to address situations that have contributed to their emergence, such as lack of economic development in many nations, the deepening of poverty and exclusion. The challenges of development not only remain with us, but have gradually increased with the growing economic and social inequalities. the international community to give priority to the fight against poverty and social exclusion. My country reaffirms its interest in the Agenda for Development, providing it with renewed impetus and a more effective approach, so that the United Nations and the commitments contained in the Millennium Declaration. It is because of the importance we attach to this issue that Mexico offered to host the International Conference on Financing for Development, to be held next year in Monterrey. I invite all heads of State or Government their active participation in the Conference, to strengthening the international communitys efforts to promote world development that is more just and more equitable, thus creatively helping institutions responsible for development financing. institutions can the multilateral to contribute, improve through fulfil to the We face the complex task of integrating our societies, without exclusion, in the process of the joint creation and equitable distribution of the opportunities and benefits of globalization. We must ensure that all citizens become stakeholders in that process; to do that, we need an enabling international environment, levels of public and private including sufficient 17 funding, along with the consolidation of an inclusive international economic system that is conducive to more equitable human development.
