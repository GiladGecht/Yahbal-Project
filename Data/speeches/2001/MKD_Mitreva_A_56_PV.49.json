{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, allow me to convey our deepest condolences the American people and Government for today(cid:146)s plane crash and to express our deepest sympathies to the families of the victims for their tragic loss. Our condolences also extend to the people and Government of the Dominican Republic, whose nationals comprised most of those on board. the need effective for more Pleading for concerted action against terrorism and for urgent accession by States to all relevant international conventions, the Millennium Summit anticipated and comprehensive joint efforts and cooperation. The tragic events of 11 September united the world and reaffirmed the resolve of all of us to fight the battle against terrorism, gathered around our common values and interests. That unprecedented terrorist attack took place during the United Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations. The fatal message of terrorism is to destroy the very essence of dialogue as a global response to conflict and violence. By adopting several resolutions, the United Nations demonstrated powerful solidarity and readiness to combat terrorism. Today that has been reaffirmed by Security Council (2001), which adopted a declaration on the global effort to combat terrorism. resolution 1377 38 By expressing its strong condemnation of the attacks and its solidarity with the American people and Government, my country, the Republic of Macedonia, immediately joined the call to establish a global international anti-terrorist coalition. We undertook concrete measures as our contribution to the global efforts and to cooperation to curb terrorist activities. terrorism As a response to terrorism and conscious of the fact transcends borders, we also that proposed the establishment of a regional anti-terrorist pact, stemming from our terrible experience with terrorism over the last eight months. We called upon the international community to cut off financial support for terrorist activities and, in that context, to strengthen the fight against organized crime, aware of the strong link between those evil phenomena. The resolution of regional conflicts is yet another significant contribution we can make to the fight against terrorism. that With regard to relevant international instruments, existing United Nations we believe the conventions provide a legal solid framework for the implementation of many measures intended to eradicate terrorism. While we strongly support the adoption of a comprehensive convention against terrorism and a consensus on a global definition of terrorism, their lack should not prevent us from taking action. international approaches towards acts of Action is needed now, from all of us (cid:151) all countries, regions and international organizations. There is no alternative to international cooperation and partnership, as there is no alternative to the common fight against organized crime, which feeds terrorism. But there is one matter we have to keep in mind: different terrorism undermine our struggle. There is no big or small terrorism, nor international or domestic, nor one that is tolerated and one that is not. No one should be allowed to practice the consequences are equally devastating. We have to defend more vigorously than ever our shared values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. We must not allow ourselves to be manipulated through the use of social, economic, religious and political differences as justification for terrorism. terror; For the past 10 years the Republic of Macedonia has developed a democratic society, a factor of stability in the Balkans. Our model of inter-ethnic relations was set out as an example and was applauded by the international community. Then, eight months ago, Macedonia was exposed to violent terrorist attacks that threatened to undermine all our achievements. Under the cloak of struggling for minority and human rights, the so-called National Liberation Army (NLA) ─ whose structure, command and control and logistics are of Kosovo provenance ─ wanted to realize one aim: the division of Macedonia and changing the borders in the region. to Our response those attacks was military, political and diplomatic. The Framework Agreement of 13 August of this year, which was signed by the leaders of the four main political parties, is a result of our strong commitment to finding a political solution to the crisis as the best way to defend our country and undermine the goals of the terrorists. But let me reiterate that we will also defend our country by other means if necessary. The cost of terrorism for Macedonia was high: lost lives, destroyed homes and thousand of refugees and internally displaced persons. The crisis also caused economic downfall and a large budget deficit. It has had a negative impact on the country(cid:146)s development and has increased unemployment and poverty rates. I therefore urge the international community, financial institutions and, in particular, the European Union to address our needs at the upcoming donors(cid:146) conference and to consider the possibility of writing off our foreign debts. At this point, allow me to underline that the international community gives strong political support to the Republic of Macedonia. The European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and NATO are playing an important role in overcoming the crisis, for which we are grateful. I would also like to commend the prompt reaction by the Security Council. The awareness that the problems in Macedonia were largely inspired in and imported from neighbouring Kosovo resulted in the adoption of resolution 1345 (2001), by which the Council, inter alia, strongly condemned extremist violence, including terrorist activities, and supported the Macedonian Government in its efforts to end the violence in a manner consistent with the rule of law. On 26 September the Council adopted resolution 1371 (2001), which supported the full implementation of the Framework Agreement and rejected the use of violence in pursuit of political goals. Even though the United Nations was not directly involved in the resolution of the crisis in Macedonia, it is present on the ground through its agencies, working in cooperation with the Government to alleviate the consequences. We are grateful for their help, too. the implementation of three policemen and Despite the efforts of the Republic of Macedonia and the international community, attempts are still being made to block the work of the parliament and to obstruct the Framework Agreement. The latest events in the Tetovo area, the death of the kidnapping of Macedonian civilians are proof that violence continues. We should all condemn these obstacles to peace and stability. Macedonia is determined to pursue the path of peace and will not allow these events to blur our vision and detract us from our main goals of building a strong democracy at home and becoming integrated into Euro- Atlantic structures. The recent history of crises has shown more than ever the importance of cooperation and solidarity among the countries of our region, and we have acted accordingly. The integration into the European Union and NATO is a common goal of all the countries in the region of South-Eastern Europe. We are all aware that membership is a solution to lasting stability and prosperity. We the strengthening of international peace and security, to enhancing international cooperation in all areas and to strengthening the role of the United Nations. This year, the Republic of Macedonia submitted, and the First Committee adopted without a vote, a draft resolution on the maintenance of international security (cid:151) good- neighbourliness, stability and development in South- Eastern Europe. That resolution was co-sponsored by 46 Member States. are determined contribute to to The struggle against terrorism must not deter us from taking up other important parts of the United Nations agenda. At last year(cid:146)s Millennium Summit we the direction of future United Nations identified activities to which we committed ourselves: the eradication of poverty, the struggle against AIDS, conflict prevention the environment. On this occasion, however, let me refer to the matter of the rights and well-being of children, and in that context to reiterate the importance of the upcoming special session on children as a forum to the protection of and 39 review the progress achieved and the further steps that need to be taken for the benefit of children all over the world. it is crucial for to be addressed immediately. the Furthermore, globalization remains one of the most important issues on the international agenda. It is obvious that there are some essential problems that need the new In millennium, international community to address the development agenda in a more appropriate way. We believe that the United Nations has a major role to play in this process. Next year(cid:146)s International Conference on Financing for Development and the World Summit on Sustainable Development are the most important events in this respect, and we should all contribute as best we can to their successful outcome. Another important issue is the trade negotiations under World Trade Organization patronage, with special emphasis on the problems of marginalization, and implementation of all multilateral environmental agreements. the new comprehensive launching of development sustainable to After 11 September, the world changed. We have to adjust the new realities. There are many challenges ahead of us, and the United Nations has to be better prepared to deal with them. That will require even greater commitment on our part. The strength and the success of our Organization depend on the resolve of all its Members to respond to the new realities in a more efficient, relevant and adroit manner. We all have our part to play in this respect. This is the best contribution we can make to building a better world for all of us. Last, but not least, allow me also to extend my sincere congratulations to the United Nations and to its Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, on the Nobel Peace Prize award. This is yet another proof of the lasting the principles and values of our relevance of the United Nations Organization as enshrined Charter and of its Secretary-General. the outstanding leadership of in "}}
