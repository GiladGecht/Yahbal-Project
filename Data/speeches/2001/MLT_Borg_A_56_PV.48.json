{"speech":{"0":" Allow me to begin by expressing my congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly. The fifty-sixth session is clearly going to be a challenging one, and one that I predict will further strengthen the resolve of members to work hand in hand on all the different issues requiring our attention. I would like also to convey my appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Harri Holkeri for the determined and skilful manner in which he presided over the previous session. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate tireless Secretary-General on the Nobel Peace Prize that they have jointly and so deservedly been awarded. the United Nations and its This session started in a markedly different manner from those of previous years. The horrendous 11 September terrorist attacks brought home the very real threat of terrorism to each and every one of us no matter what corner of inhabit. International terrorism does not limit its actions to individual countries. In fact, although the attacks were launched on United States soil, the specific targets chosen clearly show the intent to destroy symbols of the modern world, icons to free people everywhere. the world we Indeed, by attacking this cosmopolitan city and its World Trade Center, the perpetrators targeted us all. Nationals of more than 60 countries met their death in those dastardly attacks. Even if our own nationals were not among those who lost their lives, we all felt under attack. We all felt violated. In one way or another, our lives have been altered forever, and we must respond accordingly. We must fight the scourge of terrorism with unreserved and unhesitating resolve. We must do this not merely as a means to defend all that we hold dear. We must do it to secure a safer world for ourselves, for those who will follow us and for those who have had their lives irrevocably transformed as a result of these terrorist attacks. That resolve must be our tribute to the innocent and the brave who lost their lives in the l1 September attacks. The two-month postponement of the general debate has provided us with time to reflect and to act. Malta has international communitys absolute and unreserved condemnation of the terrorist acts. We have also stepped up our action in pursuit of the anti-terrorism implementation effective joined the of 5 measures, including comprehensive compliance with Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). Malta was among the first six countries to sign the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, and yesterday became one of the first States to ratify it. On Sunday, Malta also acceded to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages; and to the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. including Diplomatic Agents; to The new realities of todays world have certainly brought to the fore the importance of those conventions on terrorism. At the same time, they have also brought into bold relief the wisdom that underpins the efforts of the international community in its pursuit of the establishment of the International Criminal Court. My Government is politically committed to the Court and will seek ratification of the Rome Statute by the Maltese parliament in the near future. We feel that, in that way, we are doing all we can to ensure that no stone is left unturned in our fight against terrorism. With each passing day, we witness the domino effect that acts of terror may have at a national, regional and global level. The impact this has on the lives of millions must be addressed. We feel therefore that the time is ripe to conclude the debate on an operational definition of the perpetration of a terrorist act. Intensified efforts aimed at the expeditious conclusion of negotiations on the Indian proposal should subsequently yield a comprehensive convention on international terrorism, which will be of benefit to us all. We firmly believe that such an umbrella agreement will give added value to, and further complement, other existing conventions on terrorism. We also believe that the General Assembly should actively consider convening a high-level conference on terrorism under United Nations auspices upon or immediately after the conclusion of such a convention. That would serve to reinforce ongoing international efforts to formulate a collective response to terrorism. The unity of purpose currently prevailing within international community its fight against the terrorism the political will displayed over the past two months is a clear manifestation, that multilateralism remains a vital tool in the conduct of is perhaps unprecedented. if any were needed, Indeed, in 6 relations among States at a global level. That political will has also been seen in the other work of the Organization. Allow me therefore to turn to other issues on the agenda of the General Assembly. I would like first to express my Governments full support for the initiative of the German and French Governments to bring the issue of human cloning before the United Nations. Aimed at drafting a convention banning human cloning for the purposes of reproduction, that initiative has received wide support from all quarters. The concern expressed underlines the fundamental nature of the threat to humanity posed by scientists who are unwilling to accept ethical and moral limits on their work. In responding to the Franco- German initiative, the United Nations will ensure that a strong and meaningful convention can be drafted and adopted within as short a time frame as possible. community international into force of The United Nations has already had occasion to exhibit its ability to act swiftly and decisively when the conscience of is heightened. The entry the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, which Malta ratified earlier this year, was made possible by international communitys outrage at the devastating impact of those indiscriminate weapons, whose horrific effects long outlast their military purpose. the the Similarly, the seriousness and urgency of the problem of human cloning should expedite the conclusion of an internationally binding agreement on that issue. I have no doubt that the richly diverse beliefs reflected in this room are united in their respect for human dignity and identity, and their concern with the fundamental and far-reaching implications of human cloning. Other world events continue to pose a threat to the fundamental right of peoples to live in a secure, stable and prosperous environment. The current state of affairs in the Middle East is an example. The dramatic contrast between the Millennium Assemblys opening and the escalation in violence over the past few months has made it increasingly difficult for the parties to return to the positions they were in just over 12 months ago. the optimism apparent at Malta is convinced that the Mitchell report and readily the Tenet Plan provide a achievable way out of the spiral of violence that has realistic and of the that re-establishment the people concerned require engulfed the region. The peace, security and welfare of all their full implementation be urgently embarked upon. This necessitates security cooperation between the parties in the interests of both Israelis and Palestinians; the stationing of international observers, preferably from several regions; and an end to all new settlement activity, including so-called “natural growth”. Against this backdrop, Malta hopes that both parties will be able the negotiating table with the aim of achieving a just and permanent peace in the region on the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions. to return to Also in the Mediterranean, the situation in Cyprus has remained a cause of concern for over 25 years. We earnestly hope that an early settlement of the Cyprus question will be found. In this connection, we reaffirm our full support for efforts to find a solution on the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions. Progress towards lasting peace and stability in the Mediterranean often appears to unfold very slowly. Events in the Balkans since we met here last year, however, bring fresh hope to us all. The end of the Milosevic era was a clear example of the positive change that can be wrought through the power of the people, signalling a fresh beginning for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the neighbouring independent republics. indeed for all In recent months, turmoil and unrest have also threatened to engulf the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Yet the unfolding situation now reveals encouraging signs of the power of diplomacy. International assistance extended to republics in the Balkan region is also indicative of the power within each of us to make our own contribution and to play a part. Malta feels this onus most strongly and actively seeks to play a role on the international stage that goes beyond the mere limitations of its geographical size. In fact, in keeping with this consciousness, Malta is proceeding steadily towards its objective of acceding to the European Union — a union of like-minded States where we naturally belong, not only politically, but also economically, culturally and historically. Our intention is therefore to become an integral part of the European Union at its next enlargement, enabling us to participate fully in a decision-making process that all too often carries wide-ranging implications for our country. Like other candidate countries, Malta is currently negotiating the terms of entry into the European Union in what will be an unprecedented widening and deepening of the Union. Already more than halfway through this process, we are working hard to ensure that Malta is not only well equipped to deal with the challenges of membership but is also in a position to make a significant contribution to the Union. This historic project and the enhancement of Mediterranean cooperation are both of immediate concern to Malta. We feel that they go hand in hand. An increase in dialogue between all nations and a move towards securing a safer planet are in everyones interest. However, threats to international security, not least those posed by weapons of mass destruction, continue to lurk in the background. In July this year, Malta deposited its instrument of ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Malta hopes that the remaining 13 countries whose ratification is necessary for the Treaty to come into force will join the 84 countries that have already done this. Thus a significant collective step will have been taken towards reducing the risk of nuclear disaster. the the two link between Not so long ago, the terms “environment” and “international security” in the same sentence would have drawn a perplexed response from most audiences. Today, is becoming increasingly apparent. The urgency in addressing the greatest threats to our natural environment was made amply clear in Bonn during the sixth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Despite being faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles, the international community succeeded in forging the Earths first major action-oriented response to the phenomenon of global warming. In this respect, allow me to offer my Governments expression of gratitude to the Chairman of the Conference, Mr. Jan Pronk, as well as to my compatriot Mr. Michael Zammit Cutajar, Executive Secretary the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, for their enormous personal efforts to secure a successful outcome. Their success laid the groundwork for the breakthrough achieved at the seventh session of the Conference in Marrakech last week. The agreement on the modalities of 7 of implementation of the Kyoto Protocol has opened the door to its ratification by all States signatories. Indeed, Malta deposited its instrument of ratification yesterday and looks forward to the present momentum being sustained, leading to an early entry into force of this landmark Protocol. peoples must ensure that we continue first and foremost to build peace in the minds of men and women. That undertaking, adopted by the generation that survived the Second World War, retains its noble authenticity today as we face the challenges of our own times. Difficult and complex as it may be to tackle environmental global problems, the most challenging environmental problems are often those in our own backyards. With one of the highest population densities in the world, Malta has achieved a high level of human development without any natural resources at its disposal. In seeking to continue to raise our living standards, we grapple daily with difficult decisions aimed at ensuring that economic development on our islands is environmentally sustainable. There is no simple trade-off between the protection of the environment and the production of wealth. The Mediterranean Sea, which provides Malta with its economic lifeline, is perhaps the most tangible proof of the fact that economic progress at the expense of the environment is no progress at all. In reaping its bountiful fruits, we know that they are not unlimited and, if not tended to, will dry up altogether. The same applies to other seas and oceans. With this in mind, Malta yesterday became the thirtieth State to accede to the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks — a move that will bring the Agreement itself into force on 11 December 2001. For Malta, having initiated the process that led to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, it is a source of great satisfaction to contribute to the further development of this veritable pillar of international law. While there is inevitably still more that can be done, both at a domestic and an international level, I hope that this General Assembly session will serve as a renewed impetus for us all to promote everything necessary to make the world safer and more secure. This is our fundamental duty, as political leaders, for the welfare of present and future generations. We must continue to foster social justice, promote equitable development, nurture confidence among peoples, settle conflicts and take the appropriate measures to ensure security for all. Yet in doing all this, Governments and 8 Mr. Cem (Turkey): This meeting is being held at a most difficult hour. The terrorist attacks carried out in New York and Washington, D.C., cast a long shadow over this session of the General Assembly. But we must stand united, drawing the right conclusions from this catastrophe. The date of 11 September has made it clear that terrorism is now humankinds number-one enemy, and that it must be addressed with the utmost seriousness and determination. We share full support the American nations grief. We reiterate our the United States Administration in its efforts to track down those responsible and to bring them to justice. As a country that has lost so many of its citizens to terrorism, Turkey deeply feels the grief of this tragic event. to To combat terrorism efficiently and to develop a strong coalition of United Nations Members against terrorism, certain principles should guide our collective effort. First, terrorism does not have a religion or a geography, and there can be no justification for terrorist acts under any circumstances. Secondly, the use of double standards is the main obstacle to the fight against terrorism. Thirdly, we have to be conscious of the fact that terrorism is a global phenomenon. No ideal, no cause and no end can justify terrorism. We should avoid spurious justifications for deliberate killing. To identify terrorism with any religion is a sacrilege against all religions. We strongly condemn those who couple the name of a religion with a definition of terrorism or terrorists. To fight this dangerous trend, we fully support all initiatives aimed at dispelling these erroneous approaches. We commend the ongoing mutual efforts of the United Nations, as well as several other initiatives. In this context, Turkey has proposed an informal forum between members of, and aspirants to, the European Union and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) to discuss, from a political perspective, issues pertaining to harmony among civilizations. We have the initial support of the relevant organizations and of several countries. We hope to hold this conference by February 2002. Terrorism does not have a geography. The same terrorism manifests itself in different countries all over the world, both in the West and in the East. To be serious and effective, the anti-terrorist struggle has to be all-encompassing and deal with all terrorist centres, activities and logistics. It should address all countries that harbour and that are indifferent to terrorist groups that incite or actively plan, finance or command terrorist operations executed in another country. terrorism or tolerate in dealing with Being drawn into the trap of double standards in defining or inherently provides support for terrorism. Unfortunately, we have been witnessing several cases of double standards. I will try to give some views on this particular subject. terrorism There is an unfortunate de facto distinction made in the conceptual approaches of several countries between “bad” terrorists, who work against a particular country, and tolerated terrorists, who, while enjoying safe haven in the same country, incite, plan, finance and sometimes command terrorist acts in another. My country, as well as several others, has been victim of this double-standard approach. Groups implanted in foreign countries openly advocate the use of terrorist means under all sorts of pretexts. Their activities and messages — which call for violence, and sometimes for assassination — are freely propagated and are sometimes transmitted through the authorized media in their host countries. In short, acts and calls that would draw an immediate reaction if they were the acts and calls of their own country are ignored and tolerated when they emanate from guest terrorists targeting their country of origin. This unfortunate distinction between terrorists that hurt others but not us and the prevailing double standards have to be overcome if we are serious about fighting terrorists. indigenous terrorists targeting Terrorism is a global phenomenon that crosses borders, and the fight against it requires effective international cooperation. Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) in particular provides a clear road map regarding the steps to be taken. We hope that all Member States will this groundbreaking resolution. The establishment of the Counter-Terrorism monitor implementation of resolution 1373 (2001) is a major development. comply with Committee fully to We welcome the joint declarations of 14 and 21 September 2001 by the European Union. Turkey aligned itself with both, and we expect their prompt and resolute implementation. The European Union is in the process of identifying terrorist organizations and their terrorist organizations to be drawn up by the European Union must not be restricted only to the geographical area of its members. It should definitely include those groups that finance, plan and command terrorist activities in other countries. support networks. The list of There is a drastic need for vigilance and further cooperation between the relevant authorities, namely, the justice and interior ministries of all countries. A drastic change in attitude is imperative. In order for it to be credible and effective, the anti-terror struggle has to be comprehensive and deal with all terrorist centres. It is also incumbent upon all United Nations Member States to adopt the existing international legislation and to review national laws accordingly. International efforts to combat terrorism cannot be fully effective in the absence of a global convention in this field. The draft convention comprehensive to be our best chance on international terrorism now under discussion in the working group established by the Sixth Committee seems this shortcoming. Although all participants have displayed remarkable flexibility, the working group has failed to resolve the definition of a terrorist offence and exclusions from the scope of the convention. I wish to take this opportunity to call upon all States to make an additional effort towards finalizing the convention. two central and to address interrelated issues: and political conditions. In combating terrorism, we cannot ignore the fact feeds on deteriorating social, this scourge that Illiteracy, economic destitution, bigotry, racism, social and political injustice and similar sources of grievance all play a role in creating fertile ground for terrorism. The gap between the richest and the least fortunate nations of the world keeps widening at an alarming pace. Threats such as illegal mass migration, corruption, drugs and arms smuggling, money laundering and other types of organized crime are on the increase. It is our collective responsibility to find lasting, viable solutions to these problems. Developing nations must focus on ways of achieving sustainable economic 9 growth, on improving income distribution, education and justice and on addressing other social needs. Developed nations must be more forthcoming in debt relief, must increase development and humanitarian aid and must allow greater access to their markets. Today, the United Nations and its Member States face a mutual challenge. The name of this challenge is Afghanistan, and it has two dimensions: to combat the terrorist network, which, by exploiting the Afghan peoples plight, has taken root in its geography; and to support the revival of Afghanistan, of the Afghan identity, by ensuring peace, stability and economic development. Turkey is resolutely committed to meet this challenge; we fully support the United Nations efforts and those of the Special Representative, Mr. Brahimi. Turkey worked together with the Afghan people from the 1920s to the 1960s; and it resumed cooperation again in the early 1990s. We believe that concerted international action, with sound principles and effective means, is of crucial importance. I will try to elaborate on some suggestions. First, it is the Afghan people themselves who will rebuild their identity and their country. Our task is to assist and support their efforts — not to dictate who will run their country, and how. In this respect, regional and tribal affinities should be encouraged to merge into a single Afghan identity and assume a secondary role as sub-cultures. This is capital for Afghanistan. Secondly, all countries, either neighbours of or involved in Afghanistan, should be discouraged from relying on particular Afghan groups as their primary allies and should refrain from pursuing their special interests through those groups. Thirdly, while the fight against terrorism and its supporters goes on, special care must be taken to ensure that innocent civilians are kept out of harms way. All humanitarian support should be provided, organized and facilitated. Fourthly, in regions and cities of Afghanistan freed from terrorist oppression, the United Nations and involved forces should act immediately to ensure security and relief. The success in providing for basic needs and displaying the ability to produce a better future will be paramount in expanding positive changes to other parts of the country. Setting a successful precedent would serve as the best catalyst. 10 In administration Fifthly, and finally, everyone seems to agree that the future and Government of Afghanistan should reflect all ethnicities. It should also encompass all political trends that have not resorted to terrorism. this process, overemphasizing or undermining the role of any group in the country would be counterproductive. It is evident that in the process of rebuilding Afghanistan, the United Nations has to play a leading role. It is the duty of each and every Member State of the Organization to contribute to this gigantic task. I will touch upon one more issue, and the rest will be distributed in the paper that I have prepared. This last issue is: Cyprus. The Cyprus issue has remained for 38 years. This subject is one that is known to the United Nations. As the dates for some radical changes in Cyprus through the Greek Cypriot sides unilateral accession to the European Union seem to be suggested, and as Turkey considers these changes potentially dangerous for the two parties and for the whole region, this issue needs further attention. Any artificially imposed solution that is not mutually acceptable to both nations in the island and to the guarantor countries is bound to create a severe crisis. Turkey, as well as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), aspire to a mutually acceptable solution, sought through all possible means. A unilateral act by the Greek Cypriots, in violation of the 1959-1960 system, and pretending to represent both nations, contradicts the legal framework and the realities of Cyprus. The legal and practical realities do not permit any party in the island to decide unilaterally to enter any international body of which both Turkey and Greece are not members; and any such decision has to be taken mutually by the two co- founders. Through formal decisions of their parliaments and Governments, both Turkey and the TRNC have declared that they will not accept any solution that is not freely negotiated and mutually accepted. Both Turkey and the TRNC have also made it clear that they reject any such development, which would make the Turkish Cypriots a minority under Greek Cypriot rule. The Turkish Government will not allow the resurgence of a situation that in 1964 and 1974 caused massive crimes to be committed against the Turkish Cypriots. Turkey and the TRNC are for a solution based on the realities of the island. There are two distinct nations with different religions, languages and cultures with two separate States and democracies in Cyprus. The confederation proposal of President Denktas deserves serious consideration. We also support the Secretary- Generals Mission of Good Offices and his efforts to start a new phase of talks. In order to succeed, this initiative should depart from sufficient common ground. Turkey welcomes the recent proposal of President Denktas to his Greek Cypriot counterpart that they get together informally, without any preconditions, and discuss all relevant issues in order to find a way forward. The refusal of the Greek Cypriot party is in no ones interest. The tragedy of 11 September can be viewed as an omen of what can happen if the slightest carelessness is shown towards any of the old and new threats the world faces in the modern age, be they terrorism, environment or poverty. All I have said points to the need for the strong commitment of Member countries to efforts aimed at the shaping of a better future. I point as well to the need to strengthen and streamline the United Nations, with all its principal organs. This General Assembly session of 2001 is a meaningful link in the chain which the international community has forged to meet the growing challenges of the new century. With realism and courage we shall succeed. "}}
