{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of the delegation of the Union of Myanmar, I wish to extend our warmest congratulations to Mr. Han Seung-soo on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. His election to this high office reflects the trust and confidence of all the Member States in his diplomatic skills and leadership qualities and in his ability to guide our deliberations to successful conclusions. It is also a tribute to his country, the Republic of Korea, which is at the forefront in our common efforts to achieve the goals of the Organization. In the discharge 16 of his heavy responsibilities, may I assure him of our full support and cooperation. I also wish to express our deep appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, for his able leadership and valuable contribution during the fifty- fifth session of the General Assembly. May I also take this opportunity to congratulate our Secretary-General on his re-election to lead the Organization for a second term. I also wish to pay tribute to him for his tireless efforts and far-sighted initiatives to strengthen the United Nations. The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to our Secretary-General and to the Organization is well-deserved recognition in this regard. The international community was greatly shocked by the recent horrendous terrorist attacks in the United States of America. We are profoundly saddened by the enormous loss of lives and property. We join the international community in extending our deep condolences to the people of the United States in general and in particular. Wherever and by whomever committed, terrorism in any form or under any circumstances is unjustifiable. As a nation that has had bitter experiences with terrorism, both on its own soil and against its aircraft and diplomatic service abroad, Myanmar is against terrorism in all forms and manifestations. the bereaved families The challenges of combating terrorism are both difficult and complex. Therefore, it is essential that the international community come together under the aegis of the United Nations to overcome the enormous challenge. In this regard, I commend the Secretary-General for organizing a treaty event at United Nations Headquarters from 10 to 16 November 2001. Myanmar is already a party to 4 of the 12 conventions on terrorism, and on 12 November we signed the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and acceded to the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. In the aftermath of the economic crisis of 1997, Asian countries are still striving to return to a path of sustained growth. However, the current slowdown in the major economies of the world is threatening to negate whatever progress they have made. As these economies continue with structural reforms to sustain their economic recovery, they are confronted with an international economic and trading environment that is not very encouraging. demand. External This situation is creating difficulties, especially for many developing countries and economies in transition. Commodity prices are declining due to weakening world financing conditions are also worsening. Factors such as indebtedness, declining official development assistance and low levels of domestic and foreign investment continue to undermine the programmes of the most vulnerable States. It this unfavourable backdrop that Myanmar is striving to achieve economic development of the country. is against There are also hindrances to our efforts to promote the well-being of our people, such as denial of official development assistance and the application of unilateral and coercive economic measures. However, we are resolute in our efforts to achieve our goals by relying on our domestic resources and internal strength and by putting our comparative advantages to optimum use. Our sustained national efforts for development have resulted in 8.4 per cent average annual growth during the last five-year plan, resulting in a substantial increase in per capita income and in better living standards for the people. In their respective endeavours to bring about economic development and social progress, the developing countries continue to face formidable challenges. The debt burden, the declining flow of official development assistance, the lack of market access and access to technology, and the decline in foreign direct investment continue to persist. The United Nations must play a central role in helping those countries to help themselves. In this regard, we recognize the important role of United Nations funds and programmes in international cooperation for development. However, their important role should not be undermined by practices that are not in conformity with the principles underpinning the operation of those funds and programmes. Moreover, they should not be used as a platform for exerting pressure on a country that needs and deserves international cooperation in its development efforts. While acknowledging the role of various funds and programmes, we are particularly appreciative of the important role of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). In United Nations operational the activities for development, UNDP serves as for instrument capacity-building principal in developing countries. Myanmar regrets, however, that the United Nations Development Programme is not allowed to have a country programme for Myanmar. While UNDP continues in Myanmar, it is, however, prohibited from promoting capacity-building for reasons other than those for which UNDP was created. its useful activities In the present context of an extremely difficult economic and trading environment, the denial of the right of development in need of international cooperation is a matter that deserves appropriate redress. to a country The HIAIDS pandemic poses a serious challenge to the international community. The response of the international community and the efforts being made at the national, regional and international levels to counter this global threat are very encouraging. However, the real challenge for us is the high level of resources needed to combat this disease effectively. It is therefore most welcome that a global AIDS and health the determination and will that has been demonstrated in current efforts, and strengthened with adequate resources, we are convinced that we will eventually win this war on HIAIDS. Myanmar fully recognizes the nature and gravity of the HIAIDS problem, is taking the necessary actions at the national level and is enhancing our cooperation at regional and international levels. established. With fund has been the Let me take this opportunity to apprise the Assembly of the political situation in our country. As the Assembly is aware, Myanmar is in the process of establishing a multiparty democracy with a sound economy. All of the measures that we have taken are directed towards that end in a focused manner. This is the course of action which we will pursue steadfastly to its logical end - that is, until democracy is firmly established. We have learned from bitter experience, as well as from the lessons of other countries with similar experiences, and we are taking great care to ensure that the transition to a new system is peaceful, smooth and effective and that the foundations we are striving to lay are placed on firm ground. We have also been taking effective measures for national reconciliation. We have reached arrangements with 17 out of 18 armed groups, who are now joining hands with the Government in national development 17 in his endeavours. In the same vein, we are also making national reconciliation efforts with the political parties. Here, let me stress what the Secretary-General has so rightly outlined report. Our national reconciliation efforts are home-grown, and our goal of building a peaceful and democratic society can be successfully achieved only by the people of Myanmar. Myanmar continues to make relentless efforts to combat the scourge of narcotic drugs. We have made considerable headway in the suppression of opium and heroin. The latest figures show that opium production has declined by 38 per cent. To achieve this, we tackled the problem in a holistic manner. We have strengthened our legislation; we have enhanced our enforcement capacity; and we have combined these measures with a development programme to find alternative livelihoods for people in remote areas, so that they do not have to resort to growing opium. While we are taking effective measures against the cultivation, production and trafficking of the opium poppy, we are also taking action against the danger of amphetamine-type stimulants, which are relatively new but equally dangerous narcotic drugs. Due to their availability and affordable price, the widespread use of these stimulants among young people has led to an alarming situation in our subregion. This situation calls for renewed efforts at the national level and for stepped-up cooperation at the subregional level. To enhance cooperation at the regional level, ministers from Myanmar, China, Thailand and Laos met in Beijing in August and agreed to cooperate closely to fight the problem. Our efforts have achieved tangible results: the seizure of drugs and the arrest of the traffickers involved. Myanmar fully understands how important and urgent it is to combat this scourge afflicting mankind. We have made a firm commitment at the highest political level and are determined to translate these commitments into practical and effective measures within the set time-frame. I wish to inform the Assembly that we have also enhanced our cooperation with the United Nations system. We continue our cooperation with Mr. Razali Ismail, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, who completed his fifth visit to the country in August. Another visit towards the end of this year has also been agreed to. Mr. Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, Special 18 Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, visited the country twice earlier this year. to the assess three-week visit team paid a objectively Determined to resolve the issue of forced labour, Myanmar is fully cooperating with the International Labour Organization (ILO). In September 2001, an to ILO high-level Myanmar practical implementation and actual impact of the legislative, executive and administrative measures adopted by the Government to eliminate the practice of forced labour. The Government extended its full cooperation to the team in arranging its meetings in Myanmar and its fact- finding trips to various parts of the country identified by it. What was most important, we gave the team unfettered freedom and unlimited access to carry out its mandate successfully. Let me now make a few observations concerning the work of the Organization. Last year, our heads of State and Government and leaders gathered in the General Assembly Hall and charted a road-map to guide our future actions. All our work and energy must be directed towards effectively using that road-map to achieve a peaceful and developed world. Peace and the development of nations are the twin objectives of our Organization. While a considerable degree, reduced our planet to the village level, the issues we face in achieving peace and development are global in scale and complexity. As we are acutely aware, no one country is capable of resolving those issues on its own. It is only through concerted efforts and genuine partnerships that we will be able to address those issues of a global scale. globalization has, to its global mission We believe that as the only universal forum with the most comprehensive mandate, the United Nations must play a central role and coordinate our actions in those efforts. At the same time, the United Nations must be further strengthened and vitalized to be able to and carry out expeditiously. That will further strengthening of its organs and institutions. For our part, we must provide the Organization with the resources and the level of support needed to implement its mandate. It is also vitally important to give real effect to our pledges through concrete actions if our Organization is to be successful in building a world of peace and development. effectively require the "}}
