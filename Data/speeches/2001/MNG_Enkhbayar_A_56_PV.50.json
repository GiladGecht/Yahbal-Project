{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, I wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, upon his unanimous re-election. The Nobel Peace Prize conferred upon the United Nations and its Secretary-General testifies to the broad recognition of the increasing role played by the world Organization in promoting peace, security and development and vests in it, at the same time, greater responsibility and trust in meeting both the existing and evolving global challenges. the challenge of This session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when the international community is drawn together more closely in the face of the unprecedented task of developing an effective response to terrorism. The people and Government of Mongolia have resolutely condemned the barbaric attacks of 11 September as a deliberate act of terrorism against freedom and democracy — an attack against all humanity and expressed its full support for the collective efforts of the anti-terrorist coalition. From this high rostrum, I wish to reaffirm to our common Mongolias strong commitment struggle against the scourge of terrorism. I wish, on behalf of the Government of Mongolia, to reiterate our profound sympathy to the people and Government of the United States of America and to all the families that have been affected by this tragic event. I also express my condolences the Governments of the United States of America and the Dominican Republic over the tragic accident that took place yesterday here in New York. to New Yorkers and to The response of the international community to the terrorist attacks has clearly demonstrated its firm resolve to collectively fight this global scourge. In this respect, Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) of 28 September is a timely measure, unprecedented both in its scope and nature. It has laid the groundwork for practical measures to be taken by all Member States in the fight against terrorism and established an effective mechanism implementation. My Government is taking every necessary measure to implement the provisions of the resolution and the relevant report to that effect was submitted to the counter-terrorism Committee of the Security Council on 10 November. to monitor its I wish also to inform the Assembly that Mongolia signed yesterday the 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. With its ratification in the near future, Mongolia will be party to all the United Nations anti-terrorism conventions applicable to it. We also believe that, in light of recent events, the existing international legal framework on terrorism ought to be further strengthened through the speedy conclusion of a comprehensive convention against international terrorism and a convention against nuclear terrorism, preferably at this session of the General Assembly. In the same vein, the pace of setting up International Criminal Court must be accelerated. the In order to put the anti-terrorist strategy in the right perspective, it would seem important to us to see the problem in a wider setting, that is, to address issues that provide a fertile soil for terrorism, such as transnational organized crime, illicit drugs, money laundering, illegal arms trafficking and others. The United Nations, in our view, is uniquely positioned to meet such a challenge and to develop a comprehensive strategy through global and concerted action. international to uproot terrorism The events of 11 September have drastically changed the world as we see it. It has revealed the heightened vulnerability of the human family. It has also revealed, in no uncertain terms, the need for change in our approach to the way we perceive our own security. In this regard, the concept of human security, which places the safety, security and well- being of a human being at the heart of the matter, deserves our utmost attention. We see the prime merit of the human security concept to be that it addresses in a comprehensive manner the three-tiered freedom outlined in the Millennium Declaration: freedom from want, freedom from fear and freedom to live in a healthier and cleaner environment. it In the emerging era of globalization, is becoming increasingly evident that no country can ensure its security on its own. This indivisibility of global human security requires a genuine display of solidarity and collective responsibility on the part of every country of the international community so that it can effectively address the formidable challenges at the turn of the new millennium. the worlds poor After several decades of development efforts, the number of an embarrassingly high level. Exclusion, marginalization and inequality among and within countries are being further exacerbated by both existing and evolving transboundary threats. remains at arises: Why? Does Looking back, one could describe the decade of the 1990s as a decade of commitments for development, with a series of international conferences and summits resulting in important declarations and plans of action. Yet today, the world finds itself in many respects in no better shape. The legitimate question international community, increasingly seen as a single human family living in a shared global village, have the capacity to redress this situation? Technically, the right answer seems to be yes. There are resources — financial, human and technological — to ensure a better life. On the other hand, one has to admit also that the underlying reasons could be manifold, as the changes undergone and challenges faced by the world over the last decade are indeed complex both in nature and in scope. the Yet, we cannot but agree with the Secretary- General that 7 gap “The widening achievements implies community has failed commitments (, para. 81) goals and between that international the to deliver on crucial the 1990s”. it made during to to fail implement The real, hard question is then: Do we have the sufficient political will and sense of solidarity to forge the genuine partnership needed to erase the staggering discrepancy between commitments and action? In the final analysis, the answer to this question has to be affirmative and has to be supported by practical, meaningful action. We cannot afford to fail to honour for yet another decade our commitments if we are serious about ensuring human security. We cannot afford the far-reaching yet achievable targets set by the Millennium Summit last year. Our failure could be used as a justification for deadly acts by those who pose a threat to humanity. Let us therefore make the first decade of this new century one of implementation and cooperation for a safer, healthier and better world. Additional efforts are urgently required, and affluent countries could exhibit their solidarity and shared responsibility by further opening their markets, providing broader and faster debt relief and giving more and better-focused development assistance and incentives for foreign direct investment flows to their less fortunate partners. We must mobilize the political will necessary to make the upcoming conferences on financing for development, food security a success. The lead-up to these important events and the conferences themselves are to take into consideration the special needs of small, vulnerable and structurally disadvantaged economies so as to enable them to integrate into the multilateral trading system and take advantage of the opportunities offered by the advance of globalization. We also believe that the transit transport cooperation, to be held in 2003, is of crucial importance in enhancing international cooperation to ease the landlocked developing countries, as recognized in the Millennium Declaration. international ministerial meeting on inherent development handicaps of sustainable development and the My delegation shares the view that a commitment to human security demands enhanced international cooperation in conflict prevention and strengthened capacities to assist countries in restoring, building and keeping the peace. In this respect, Mongolia fully supports the Secretary-General in his efforts to move 8 the United Nations from a culture of reaction to a culture of prevention. We believe that mutual understanding and dialogue among different peoples and civilizations are acutely needed to break the pattern of mistrust, suspicion and recrimination that either lead to a conflict or serve as a pretext for it. We know that mutual understanding and dialogue are possible when there is cooperation between nations. the This session of the General Assembly is of special significance to my country and its people, as we celebrate fortieth anniversary of Mongolias admission to the United Nations. On 27 October 1961 Mongolia became a full-fledged member of the world Organization, an event of historic importance to my people. Over the years our cooperation with the organizations of the United Nations family has been expanding both in scope and in substance. Today Mongolia is party to some 140 international treaties and conventions, and is a member of 33 inter- governmental and 20 regional and other organizations. The United Nations assistance and cooperation has been instrumental in developing human resources, capacity-building, education, health and information technology, the environment and developing an adequate response to natural disasters. protecting reducing poverty, Within the framework of the fortieth anniversary, we have been undertaking a host of activities to take stock of our past cooperation with the organizations of the United Nations system and identify priority areas for future cooperation. This culminated in the joint conference organized by the Government of Mongolia and the United Nations on 3 September, in Ulaanbaatar, under the theme “Forty Years of Mongolia-United Nations Cooperation: the Millennium Declaration”. The main thrust of the discussions and conclusions of that conference has been the Government of Mongolia on the implementation of the Millennium Declaration, which has been circulated as an official document of this session of the General Assembly. the memorandum of Implementation incorporated into of Over the last four decades of our cooperation, Mongolia has been endeavouring to contribute, where it could, to the common efforts of the international community to promote peace, cooperation and development. My delegation is proud to recall that on the initiative of Mongolia the General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Right of Peoples to resolutions Peace, the principles and guidelines for international negotiations, to observe annually a Disarmament Week and relevant resolutions on the importance of human resources, cooperatives, rural women and the special needs of the landlocked developing countries. Furthermore, as a strong advocate of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various parts of the world, in 1992 Mongolia declared its own territory a nuclear-weapon-free zone, and has been working to further institutionalize this. the Recognizing the crucial role of education in ensuring sustainable human development and human security, my delegation is pleased to note that this session of the General Assembly is about to proclaim, on Mongolias initiative, the 10-year period beginning 1 January 2003 the United Nations decade for literacy. Mongolia supports peacekeeping operations as one of important means of maintaining international peace and security. Since the mid-1990s, Mongolia has taken deliberate steps and made measurable progress in developing its peacekeeping capability. Showing its willingness to contribute to the United Nations peacekeeping missions through direct participation, in 1999 Mongolia signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations on standby arrangements regarding the provision of staff officers, military observers and medical officers. Mongolia stands ready to actively cooperate with the United Nations and to make a practical contribution to its peacekeeping operations. that (), As a member of the Conference on Disarmament, Mongolia cannot but fully agree with the Secretary- General, in paragraph 77 of his report on the work of the “level of the Organization international cooperation remains disappointingly low.” In order to bring the Conference on Disarmament out of its ongoing stalemate it may seem advisable the disarmament agenda by convening a Security Council meeting at the highest level or holding one of the future sessions of the Conference on Disarmament at the level of Foreign Ministers. to give political in disarmament impetus to in international In recent years Mongolia has been an active participant at strengthening institutions and processes of democratic governance, protecting human rights and promoting democratic consolidation. The 1992 Constitution of Mongolia people the Mongolian guarantees activities aimed to all major international human fundamental freedoms and human rights. Mongolia is party rights instruments. Earlier this year Mongolia set up an independent National Human Rights Commission. Yesterday Mongolia signed the two Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Willing to share fresh experience of peaceful and simultaneous transition to democracy and a market- oriented economy over the last decade and to learn more from the valuable experiences of other countries, Mongolia has offered to host the Fifth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies in 2003 in Ulaanbaatar. its in The task of ensuring human security and promoting human-centred development is high on the agenda of my Government, as envisaged its programme of action. Recognizing the importance of the quality of governance in achieving development goals, my Government approved a national programme on good governance for human security to facilitate the policy focus, coherence and sustainability of its programme of action. Mongolia has thus become the first country aspiring to ensure human security through building good governance. As we move along this trailblazing path, we are aware of the need for the knowledge, expertise, experience and assistance of the organizations of the United Nations system and our fellow members of the international community. growth through the people, reinvigorating The Government is resolved to ensure sustained economic and encouraging the development of domestic industry, rehabilitating the banking sector, upgrading the living standards of reducing poverty and unemployment, and ensuring equitable social and educational opportunities. We will intensify structural reforms and encourage an export-oriented, private- sector-led economy. Mining, processing of raw materials of animal origin, tourism and other export- oriented sectors are top priority areas of development. Privatization of State assets, including the most valuable State enterprises, will continue. The creation of a favourable environment for the attraction of foreign investment is also a priority objective. the In its endeavours to carry out simultaneous economic and political reforms Mongolia faces many challenges. On behalf of the Government of Mongolia, I wish to express our sincere gratitude and high appreciation to our bilateral and multilateral partners for their generous support and cooperation pledged at 9 the eighth meeting of the Mongolia Assistance Group, held last May in Paris, demonstrating thus their support of my Governments policy and action. Mongolia will continue its active participation in multilateral processes and international organizations such as the United Nations and will spare no effort to ensure that the world Organization remains a focal point for coordination of the effort of the community of nations toward peace and development in the years to come.
