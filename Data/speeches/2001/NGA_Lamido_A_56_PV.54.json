{"speech":{"0":" Recent events have manifestly brought to the fore the importance and relevance of the United Nations in the pursuit of global peace, security and stability. Only last year in this historic Hall, world leaders at the Millennium Summit reaffirmed their solemn commitment to strengthen the capacity of the Organization in this very important area. Yet, two months ago, on 11 September 2001, the efforts of our Organization were temporarily called into question by terrorist attacks on the United States. As a country which was directly affected by the first terrorist bombings in Dar es Salaam in 1998, in which our embassy building was destroyed, and because we lost nationals at the attack on the World Trade Center, Nigeria fully identifies with the rage and grief of the bereaved families and the victims of these barbaric acts. Terrorism is a global menace that challenges the very basis of our civilization. It must therefore be confronted globally. That is why Nigeria fully endorses the prompt action taken by the General Assembly in condemning these attacks. We fully support Security Council resolution 1373 (2001), because the measures called for in the resolution would significantly reduce the capacity of terrorists to carry out such acts. Nigeria is committed to the implementation of the resolutions provisions. Let us sustain the unity of purpose and resolve that the terrorist attacks have generated by strengthening the cooperation and coordination among our countries. The terrorists and their supporters should be exposed for what they are: fringe elements undeserving of a respectable place in the comity of nations. Our strategies therefore should be informed, consistent and focused. In some respects, the grave challenges that we face today also offer new possibilities for cooperation previously unimaginable. Our Organization has not only pursued the goal of international peace and security, but it has also served as a focal point for the promotion of other important agendas, particularly in the areas of socio-economic development, the rule of law, good governance and respect for human rights. These goals, which reflect the aspirations of Member States to build a new world free of conflict, prejudice, discrimination and oppression, must the remain enduring preoccupation of our common enterprise. For this, we have a clear compass, not only in the Charter solemn of our Organization, but also commitment of our in the Millennium Declaration. Let us strive to translate these commitments into practical policies for the benefit of our peoples. the leaders, as reflected in My countrys long-standing commitment to fostering the objectives of the United Nations in the area of conflict prevention, peace and stability is well known. It is regrettable that conflicts and wars continue to be waged in many parts of the world. It is particularly disheartening that Africa has had a disproportionate share of these conflicts and wars, with devastating impact on our societies and peoples. Yet, amid the apparent gloom, we see a flicker of hope. The process of peace and stability in Sierra Leone is gaining momentum, as the process of reconciliation, through a programme of disarmament, demobilization and rehabilitation, funded by the United Nations, has continued to generate trust and confidence. We are equally encouraged by in Burundi, where a newly installed interim transitional Government the challenges of national reconciliation and integration. These efforts attest to the determination of leaders in our continent to make a success of initiatives for peace. Nigeria is proud these efforts. Our experience in Liberia and Sierra Leone has reinforced our conviction that, working in close partnership with regional and subregional organizations, the United Nations can facilitate the return to peace and security in conflict areas. Let us provide these organizations with the necessary financial and logistic support. to be associated with recent developments is grappling with Apart from the commitment to durable peace and security, there must be a re-intensification of our resolve to eliminate weapons of war, both conventional and non-conventional. Of the utmost concern to us in Africa is the havoc caused by the proliferation of small arms and light weapons. The Programme of Action adopted at the recently concluded United Nations Conference on Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects provides us with a clear road map for effective cooperation. Its effective implementation will attest to our commitment to strengthen the forces of democracy and the rule of law in the world. We recognize of globalization and fully embrace the challenges of expanding opportunities in trade, finance, information inexorable march the 17 the twin phenomena of and communications technology which it offers. But the benefits should not be limited to only a small section of the international community. Globalization and liberalization and deregulation should work for all countries. The health and stability of the global economic system demand nothing less. For us in Africa, access to such benefits should be reflected in concrete actions and measures that will ensure our full integration into a new and fair global economic system. Nigerias call for a fundamental change in current debt strategies towards developing countries is derived from a keen appreciation of the impact external debt has on the economic growth and political stability of developing countries. The fact that, in spite of welcome initiatives on debt relief and debt management, many of our countries have neither grown out of debt nor been able significantly to service their debts in a sustainable manner, warrants a bolder and more imaginative debt cancellation. approach, outright such as International efforts to resolve the debt problem should be bolstered by collective action to discourage the illegal transfer of funds from developing countries and the repatriation of such funds to the countries of origin. African leaders have established a clear linkage between our huge debt burden, the activities of foreign collaborators and the transfer of funds by former leaders and other individuals from our continent. We are concerned about the corrosive impact of corruption on our fledgling democracies and our social, economic and political development. Let us redouble our efforts to support an international instrument on the illegal transfer of funds abroad. inaugural meeting of At the thirty-seventh regular session of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which took place in Lusaka in July, the leaders of the continent endorsed the New African Initiative, now called the New Partnership for Africas Development (NEPAD). The Implementation Committee of Heads of State and Government on NEPAD took place in Abuja on 23 October 2001. Based on a common vision and shared conviction about the need to urgently eradicate poverty and place African countries on the path to sustainable growth and development, NEPAD has, among its key themes, the promotion of peace, democracy, human rights, social and economic management, regional cooperation and the support economic integration. We appreciate the 18 already offered, and we sincerely believe that this provides the best platform for a viable partnership with our development partners. the the contribution of that we have reason The HIAIDS pandemic continues to pose serious challenges to development in our world. We appreciate international community in combating that scourge, as reflected in the outcome of the special session on HIAIDS. Africas resolve to meet the pandemic head-on has struck a responsive chord, and we are grateful to the United Nations Secretary-General for his clear advocacy. I believe to be encouraged by the progress made in establishing structures and a multilateral framework for greater cooperation and support in confronting the problem. Every effort should be made to ensure that the Global AIDS and Health Fund becomes operational by January 2002. Meanwhile, we should maintain the momentum so that in the shortest possible time we bring succour to those who live with AIDS or suffer from tuberculosis or other related the expectation of the African leaders who met in Abuja in April this year to agree on a coordinated strategy on this health and development crisis. Our attention should also be focused on the campaign against malaria, as a follow-up to an earlier summit, which also took place in Abuja. infectious diseases. This is to ponder The rescheduling of the United Nations special session on the rights of the child to May 2002 should provide us with an opportunity the challenges which the worlds children face today. For us in Nigeria, the session will coincide with the passage of far-reaching legislation, now before the National Assembly, to protect our children, and go beyond the provisions of the OAU African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, which we have recently ratified, to revolutionize public awareness and the defence of their rights. Indeed, in mid-2002, Nigeria proposes to host an international conference that will, inter alia, address the issue of trafficking in children in our region. We look forward to the participation of Member States. to I cannot conclude without reference the question of the reform of the United Nations system. Nigeria maintains that, in order for the United Nations to meet the complex challenges of our new century, long-overdue reforms of the Organization must be speedily undertaken. The reform of the Security Council, in particular, constitutes one of the major challenges facing the United Nations today. Let us work assiduously to complete the reform process and thereby make the enlarged and expanded Council truly representative of the United Nations membership. May I express our profound gratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his leadership of our Organization in the past year. Nigeria rejoices with him over his well-deserved re-election, a reward for faithful stewardship and a signal of the trust and confidence of the United Nations membership in his shared vision for the future. No less significant is the award to him and to our Organization of the Nobel Peace Prize for 2001. We wish him well and heartily congratulate the United Nations on that achievement. I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Souef Mohamed El-Amine, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Comoros. Mr. El-Amine (Comoros) (spoke in French): On behalf of the Comorian delegation, which I have the honour to lead, and on my own behalf, I offer you, Sir, our warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. We express the ardent hope that our work, under your enlightened leadership, will be successful. My delegation and I pay a ringing tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for the excellent manner in which he led the work of the previous session. As to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, I praise the merits of that man of such great talent and exemplary wisdom, and I also pay tribute to his dedication to the service of our world Organization. The Nobel Peace Prize that was awarded to him, together with our Organization, is concrete proof of his outstanding values. On 11 September, the entire world was plunged into gloom and anarchy. Terrorist networks defied the entire their reprehensible attacks on American interests here in New York, this global, hospitable and cosmopolitan city — this capital of the entire world. international community through Thus, I cannot fail in my duty to convey, from this rostrum, the deep sympathy and compassion of the Government and people of the American people and Government following those painful, tragic and most unfortunate events. We offer our most grief-stricken condolences in particular to the the Comoros to families of the victims, whose terrible pain we share following these sudden deaths. Furthermore, we were deeply moved by the loss of lives in the aeroplane accident that took place last Monday here in New York. We extend our sincere condolences to the Governments and peoples of the United States and the Dominican Republic and to the bereaved families. In the course of the previous session and of the Millennium Summit, the central role that has been and must continue to be played by our Organization was broadly reaffirmed in many statements. The reform of the main organ responsible for international peace and security to make it reflect the realities of todays world was seen by all to be a priority. Today more than ever before, that role must be strengthened, because the United Nations responsibility requires it to be better equipped fully and effectively to assume it. In this respect, it is appropriate to point out that this responsibility is of a different order. Above and all, it is the responsibility “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”, to cite the expression of the Charter that governs our institution. This primary responsibility requires the Organization to ensure the peace and security of peoples. Today, crises of all sorts and the precariousness of the cause of peace in many regions demonstrate the United Nations highly difficult task in assuming that responsibility. The varied threats to peace that are spreading throughout the world call on us to focus greater attention on taking urgent international action, for no continent is safe from the danger. Terrorism is one component of that danger. We must not allow extremist groups, regardless of their pretexts, to plunge the world into perpetual psychosis and to claim millions of innocents as their unfortunate victims. The attacks of 11 September were a harsh blow for all of us, a challenge to all mankind. The Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros therefore strongly condemned those hateful and barbarous acts, just as it condemns terrorism in all its forms. Thus, in the framework of mobilizing efforts to combat terrorism, the conferences held in Doha and Dakar last month, in which the Government of the Comoros played an active role, reified the commitment of the Arab world and the African continent to this difficult but necessary struggle. In the same way, the meeting in Brussels brought the countries of Europe 19 together in a manifestation of the continents abiding concern over terrorism. In this approach, however, it is first necessary to define the notion of terrorism by clearly establishing what constitutes State, group and individual terrorism. We must then distinguish between terrorist acts and the legitimate claims of certain peoples to their right to self-determination, which indubitably cannot be exercised without confrontation, since it is often met with resistance and even oppression. Finally, it is essential that we in no way confuse terrorism with Islam, since we know, on the one hand, that every terrorist act is the expression of an extremism that is by no means linked to a given religion or nation, and that, on the other, Islam is known for its great tolerance and openness, advocating love of ones fellow man, peace and solidarity. With respect to my country, the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, the concern of our highest authorities vis-a-vis this problem has led them to establish a national mechanism to combat terrorism, which has been placed under the leadership of the Prime Minister. In January 2000, my country also signed the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. In addition to such national commitments on the part of every one of our countries, it is clear that we will need to engage in regional and continental forces to fight this scourge, which threatens world peace and destabilizes the economies of our countries. International Convention international action by joining the for This requires an objective political reading of the situation prevailing in areas of tension throughout the world. From that perspective, the situation in the occupied Arab territories, among other problems, calls for our attention today. The Palestinian people has the same right as every other nation on Earth to life, happiness, prosperity, peace and security. That is why, in respect for the law and in order to reach a just, lasting and definitive solution to this problem, the Comorian Government believes that an independent Palestinian State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, is necessary. From another point of view, the United Nations has the responsibility to safeguard the welfare of peoples. That entails guaranteeing the conditions for a better life by protecting fundamental human rights. Indeed, serious diseases affecting our countries, in particular the developing ones; difficult the 20 regions of the world; access to better education and health care; the famine that afflicts several the deterioration of our environment; and the violation of human rights remain the major challenges to our millennium. Some of these evils, such as famine, serious disease and the extreme poverty afflicting many countries, eloquent manifestations of a gap between North and South that we will ultimately have to bridge. themselves very are in As to disease, AIDS is at the heart of our discussions and concerns, because it kills, empties entire regions and every year creates millions of orphans whose future is bleak. Thus, in the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, despite a relatively low rate of incidence, the Government remains aware that the prevalence of tourism in our island subregion are factors that could contribute to the rapid spread of the disease, given the influx of tourists and seasonal holiday-makers. the countrys geographical position and (UNAIDS). The commitment of That is why our Government is devoted to making the national programme against AIDS a useful tool by giving it, as much as possible, the appropriate means, with the undeniable help of the World Health Organization and Joint United Nations Programme on HIAIDS the Government of Comoros to this fight against AIDS is also expressed by its participation in all regional or international measures to this effect. Thus, a delegation from Comoros, led by His Excellency Mr. Hamada Madi Bolero, the Prime Minister, took part last June in the special session of the General Assembly on AIDS, held in this city. The recommendations from that session were borne in mind by our national authorities. Speaking of diseases, I should not overlook malaria, which still affects many regions. In Comoros, it affects all layers of society and becomes a source of major concern for the national authorities. This is why, beyond the national provisions within the framework of the national strategy to fight malaria, my country welcomes the initiative to proclaim the period 2001- 2010 the Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Africa. I spoke earlier about the gap that separates economies of the North from those of the South. From this point of view, the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Brussels in May 2001, is of particular interest for our countries, and we count on more resolute commitment from all of us, rich and poor countries, so that the recommendations made on that occasion and those that will be adopted within the framework of the conference that is currently being held in Doha, in Qatar, will lead to positive changes and lay a solid basis for sustainable and effective development by revitalizing our economies. Our peoples expect much from our Organization, recognized as offering the best framework to guarantee the fundamental rights of all. This is why, confident in the United Nations to ensure the respect for unity and territorial integrity of our respective countries, the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros urges our Organization to consider the legitimate claim of the Chinese Government with respect to the reintegration of the Chinese province of Taiwan in its natural entity. My country, especially sensitive to this problem, as we ourselves have had a painful secessionist experience, believes firmly in the need to find swift solutions to this type of situation, which could undermine the stability of regions. The Millennium Summit prompted great hopes, which we must turn into reality, in order to thus recognize all the importance that it has in the eyes of humanity. This means that there should be a follow-up of the recommendations made on this occasion. We can only strongly wish that everyone will take due account of the true diagnosis made of our world in order to seek together the appropriate remedies. Everyones interest and survival depends on this, because when our neighbours peace is threatened, no one is safe; likewise, as long as hunger, disease, ignorance, violence, injustice and poverty still subsist in certain regions, they will be a cause of shame for all humanity and a potential threat to peace and stability. A year after the last session, during which I spoke from this high rostrum on, among other points, the general situation that prevailed in my country, the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, I would like to speak about certain aspects of the way the situation is evolving. I am pleased to announce today that the process of national reconciliation, led by the Head of State of my country, His Excellency Colonel Azali Assoumani, in which he opted for direct dialogue with our brothers from the island of Anjouan, is making progress daily. Indeed, at the present time, a draft constitution, which would govern the future of the whole of the Comoros, has just been handed to the Head of State and will be submitted to a referendum before the end of this year. All of the political parties took part in drafting this document, and we also benefited from the international community, assistance of including the Organization of la Francophonie and the League of Arab States with respect to expertise in constitutional law. the Organization of African Unity, the entire Alongside these efforts, provisions are being made to prepare the upcoming elections, for which the international community, through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the European Union, will also provide considerable technical assistance. In this phase towards transitional the establishment of new institutions, the Government of Comoros is not sparing any effort to improve the current conditions in order to allow our population to lead a decent and acceptable life. These significant efforts must of course be supported by the international community in order to help the social sectors in difficulty. The great challenge for our Government, in addition to this reconstruction now under way, remains the achievement of harmonious social and economic development. This is why, on behalf of the Government of Comoros, I launch an urgent appeal to the entire international community to continue to provide its valuable national reconciliation for the reconstruction and establishment of institutions. support period this of in is a major concern for The secessionist crisis did not make us lose sight of the problem of the Comoran island of Mayotte, which the people and Government of my country. This island of Comoros, administered by France, is completely cut off from the rest of the archipelago, thus limiting the free movement of people and goods among islands and leading to considerable human loss for people who want to reach their families in Mayotte. the French authorities While the Government of Comoros is confident the willingness of to of cooperate fully with their Comoran counterparts in order to find a lasting and negotiated solution to the problem of island of Mayotte, we reiterate our desire to see the international community take part in this approach, out of respect for the law the Comoran 21 and in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations that admitted Comoros to the United Nations, once the new Comoran entity is set up to allow the return of Mayotte to its natural fold. Lastly, I would like to extend our profound and sincere thanks to our fraternal countries and friends, to the partners of Comoros that accompanied us in every way they could, in the search for a lasting solution to the crisis that has shaken our country and is still present in our struggle to preserve and perpetuate the precious gains that we have made from the change of 30 April 1999. May all the crises that are affecting the world today see a fortunate conclusion in the interest of our peoples. "}}
