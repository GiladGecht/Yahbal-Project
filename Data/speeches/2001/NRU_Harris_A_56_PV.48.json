{"speech":{"0":" I bid the Assembly welcome from the people of Nauru, the pleasant little island of the Pacific. Let me avail myself of the opportunity to extend to you, Sir, my Governments belated congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Much of the work of the United Nations since the despicable attacks on the United States of America on 11 September has been focused on counter-terrorism, and this is understandable. The Security Councils adoption of (2001), obligating resolution 1373 the Members to implement anti-terrorist measures, should recognize importance of supporting existing regional initiatives in the fight against terrorism. To this end, we welcome the undertakings by the Security Council Committee on Counter-Terrorism. tourism, remittances and The World Bank has predicted that the events of 11 September will exacerbate the already gloomy global economic outlook. Its ripples will be felt across all of the worlds regions, particularly in countries dependent on foreign investment. It is thus critical that the Security Council allow the competent bodies of the United Nations to assess the costs of extending, expanding or adding new peacekeeping operations before their implementation. international community in offering our belated but heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan and the Organization on being the joint recipients of this years prestigious Nobel Peace Prize. The former President of the General Assembly, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, has to be commended for capitalizing on the Millennium Declaration. the momentum generated by the Nauru joins is pleased My delegation to endorse your proposed agenda, Mr. President, for the fifty-sixth session. The work of the General Assembly should be relevant to the tasks at hand, but at the same time it should address the efficiency and status of this body. Meaningful cooperation between Member States must always be encouraged across the boundaries of religion, ethnicity issues affecting long-standing This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of speeches delivered in the other languages.

Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum. (E) *0163224* and culture. The recent World Conference against Racism is a stark reminder of how the work of the United Nations will otherwise continue to be frustrated; but the one significant area where the United Nations has made little or no progress is on the question of the reform of the Security Council. We would therefore support a proposal to move the process to a higher level and to deal with the complex issues in a step-by-step fashion. The last meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum leaders was held in my country a few months ago. The communique of that meeting has been circulated as a document of the United Nations. In that communique the Forum leaders sought to formalize cooperation arrangements between the United Nations and the Pacific Islands Forum. I would like to take this opportunity to kindly request your support of the relevant draft resolution. The issues of climate change and sea-level rise continue to be of major concern to my country, and we have repeatedly voiced our deep concern about the adverse impact of human-induced climate change, especially on the low-lying atolls around the Pacific. We have stressed the importance of efforts to build appropriate human and institutional capacity. The Kyoto Protocol represents a significant step forward on the path to taking action to combat climate change, but unless significant action is taken on a practical compliance regime, there is little prospect of any outcome being enforceable. Nauru therefore looks forward to participating with the rest of the world in Johannesburg next year to review the progress made since Rio, and it is our fervent hope that the Kyoto Protocol will have come into force by then. There is a special urgency for Nauru. Economic growth in our small country has been negative for more than a decade, and, as reflected in recent revisions of our classification by the United Nations and the United Nations Development Programme, our per capita income has fallen by almost 80 per cent since the 1980s. We look to the international community, the United Nations and its various agencies to assist us through these difficult times and to help secure a safe future for our children. Our region, the worlds very first nuclear-free zone, has a long history of supporting disarmament and 2 non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, born of the regions harsh experience with nuclear testing by colonial Powers. The Pacific Islands Forum leaders have again expressed their desire for the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Nauru will be depositing its instrument of ratification today, and I call on other States to follow suit. The trans-shipment of radioactive material and MOX fuel, through our exclusive economic zones is a continuing concern, but we are committed to pursuing our concerns constructively and vigorously at the appropriate political level. is Naurus commitment to the international effort to combat money-laundering unwavering. Our Parliament passed anti-money-laundering legislation in August of this year to correct the deficiencies in our regulatory and administrative arrangements. However, Nauru is disappointed not to have graduated from the list of special non-cooperating countries despite the fact in close collaboration with Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) regional representatives. We will nonetheless continue to work on satisfying the key players in FATF on this issue, and we look forward to working with our regional partners under the Pacific regional action plan being developed. legislation was drafted that the the inclusion of a resolution on Nauru, along with 20 other Member States, again supported the admission of the Republic of China on Taiwan on the agenda of the fifty-sixth session. While the attempt failed, Nauru will not be discouraged from continuing its efforts to correct this anomaly. We on Nauru wholeheartedly believe that the Republic of China on Taiwan has a part to play in this Organization, and its people should not be denied a voice in this world body. We note with pleasure the recent admission of the Republic of China on Taiwan to the World Trade Organization. Finally, I wish to end my statement by revisiting the issue of security and terrorism. It is indeed sad that as we meet here today, there is a war going on in the world - a war against terrorism. Prior to the horrific 11 September attacks on the United States of America, my Government, at the request of the Government of Australia, agreed to the use of Nauru as a refugee- processing centre. We made this decision on humanitarian grounds. As a consequence, we now have on Nauru nearly 800 asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Iraq and Palestine — 10 per cent of the whole population of Nauru — along with migration personnel from the United Nations, the International Organization for Migration and Australia. The asylum seekers are now being processed. I have taken it upon myself to personally visit the camps from time to time and to mingle with these unfortunate people, and on several occasions have sat down and broken bread with them. I found that they are like you and me. They are brave human beings seeking a better life for themselves and their children and escape from the oppression back home. The resources of the United Nations need to be augmented to cope with this humanitarian tragedy, and the international community needs to urgently tackle the problem in a coordinated manner, not only in terms of providing assistance and refuge where possible, but also in terms of addressing the sources and causes of terrorism. Understanding and responding will not necessarily solve the problem, but it will make it easier for Governments to share in the continuing international effort that will be needed. refugees, people- smuggling and The Honourable Daniel Toroitich arap Moi, President and Commander-in-Chief of the Republic of Kenya, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.
