{"speech":{"0":" My delegation is taking the floor to exercise, with due respect, its right of reply to some of the charges levelled against my country by the Foreign Minister of Ethiopia. I shall refrain from expressing subjective views, and only to statements made by Mr. Legwaila Joseph Legwaila, Special Representative of the Secretary-General, on each of the charges made by the Minister. I shall leave the rest to you, Sir, and to the Assembly. refer With regard to the integrity of the Temporary Security Zone, at a press conference on 18 April 2001 the Special Representative said, in Ethiopia “There are things that we can do as the United Nations Mission and Eritrea (UNMEE) and there are things that we cannot do. It depends on the willingness of the parties to negotiate with us and, finally, to agree to certain things. There are still problems, which we have to resolve insofar as the southern border of the temporary security zone is concerned ... “[The Ethiopians] told us before the 6 April [Military Coordination Commission] meeting that they had made a mistake when they gave us the redeployment points by leaving out this area of Irob. We corrected the line and then, when they completed their redeployment, we certified that they had redeployed. After a few days we discovered that they were present in the area at issue. That is the area that is six kilometres beyond the lines that we have drawn. “We issued a statement, as you said — a statement protesting the presence of the three companies in that part of Irob. I was invited with the Force Commander to go to Ethiopia to meet the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ethiopia, where we were told that Ethiopia had always been in that area, that Ethiopia had never left the area and that that area is part of ... [Ethiopian] territory ... Therefore, they have redeployed there in accordance with the line of 6 May 1998. told terms that this is a in certain “We were that nothing — and I underline nothing — would move them out of that area. Therefore, as realistic people, we have decided that there is no use in trying to push the Ethiopians out of that area because they are not going to be pushed out of that area. Nobody wants to fight the Ethiopians out of that area, and therefore we have told the President [of Eritrea] typical candidate for the Border Commission. That is the only solution, because to mortgage the creation of the temporary security zone, and the progress of the peace process generally, to a resolution of the Irob issue would be tantamount to saying you do not want to create the temporary security zone, you do not want to go forward.” Who is appeasing whom? With respect to the increasing mobilization of Eritrean troops, the Special Representative was asked the following question during a press conference on 11 October: the peace process “Ethiopia said recently that Eritrean troops are in a state of high alert and that the troops have already been dispatched towards the border area and are preparing for another round of war, but Eritrea denies it. What is your comment?” The Special Representative replied: “Well, we have investigated that. Let me remind you that [whenever] one or the other party gives us whatever report, we investigate. And therefore we have been the allegations that the Eritrean army is on high alert. And so far, we have found nothing to suggest that the Eritrean Army is on alert. Even yesterday we were running around to make sure that we were not caught by surprise.” investigating 41 On the other hand, Ethiopia is systematically violating the letter and spirit of the peace agreement and jeopardizing the peace. Let me give two examples. The peace agreement provides for a speedy exchange of prisoners of war and other detainees. During a press conference on 9 August, the Special Representative responded to a question by saying, the Peace Agreement “As you know, the parties on 12 December signed in Algiers. According to article 2 of that Agreement, they are required to release prisoners of war. As you know, soon after signing the Agreement, they started releasing prisoners of war. “Ethiopians are saying that because the Eritreans are not satisfactorily accounting for the whereabouts of the pilot Petros and 36 others who have not been accounted for, they have decided to stop releasing prisoners of war. The other side, in retaliation, is doing the same. But as we have always said, and as the International Committee of the Red Cross says, you cannot hold this process up. You cannot say that because you are not satisfied with something, you are not going to release prisoners of war. That is contrary to the Geneva Conventions.” On issue of the the Special Representative of the Secretary-General went on to say: landmines, “We are pressuring everybody to give us landmine information. Eritrea has given us records for mines. Ethiopia has given us several hundred maps. We have never hidden the fact that we have been persuading Ethiopia to continue to cooperate with us in order that we can get all the records, all the maps, all the information they have so we know where these mines are, so people can live there safely”. Eritrea rests its case. Mr. Kazhoyan (Armenia): I have asked for the floor to exercise my right of reply to the statement made yesterday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan, during which he provided information that was not quite accurate, to say the least. The statement of the Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan was a blatant attempt to distort the evidence of its State-sponsored terrorism by reversing the roles of perpetrator and victim. Reversing these roles is 42 nothing new. However, a large number of observers — governmental and non-governmental organizations, both international and domestic — have testified that it was the Azerbaijani authorities that either exterminated the non-Azeri population of Nakhichevan and Nagorny-Karabakh or created unbearable conditions for those people to live in. It was Azerbaijan that responded to the legitimate and parliamentary demands of the Armenian population of Nagorny-Karabakh with massacres and pogroms and, afterwards, with full- fledged war against the people of Nagorny-Karabakh. It has been well documented that during that war, Azerbaijan was the first to use tanks, rockets, missiles, attack helicopters and combat aircraft. They were used not only against the Karabakh self-defence forces but also against the civilian population of Nagorny- Karabakh, as well as across the border on the Armenian side. When the Armenians of Nagorny-Karabakh responded by using mostly the same weapons, which they had captured the Azerbaijani army, Azerbaijan decided their former victims “aggressors”. What about the real aggressor who started it all and is now blaming everybody else but itself? from to call Truth is one and justice is one. Azerbaijan cannot lie to all the world all the time. Azerbaijan denies the people of Nagorny-Karabakh their inalienable right to self-determination, but meanwhile stresses — here I am quoting from yesterdays statement by the Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan — that Azerbaijan “... stands for the speedy, peaceful settlement of conflict based on the norms and principles of ... the United Nations Charter [and] the Helsinki Final Act of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)”. At this stage, I wonder whether Azerbaijan stands for double standards in the application of the principles of the OSCE Helsinki Final Act, or whether the Minister is simply unaware that the principle of self- determination is one of those principles. The memory of the Armenians and others — young and old, children and women, civilians and soldiers — killed in that war should prompt us to stop blaming each other and, instead, to look to the future and try to find an acceptable, full and lasting solution based on truth, justice and respect for human rights — a call that was conveyed by my Foreign Minister in his statement yesterday. Mr. Yamtomo (Indonesia): My delegation is taking the floor in exercise of the right of reply with regard to the concern referred to by the representative of Papua New Guinea. My delegation would like to state that the Government of Indonesia firmly believes that the case will be investigated, with the aim of bringing to justice those responsible, in accordance with Indonesian law. We therefore urge others to respect the investigation process and not to interfere in it. We wish to assure the representative of Papua New Guinea that this case will receive the full attention of the Government, as it involves its own citizens. I should also like to emphasize the fact that this case is a purely domestic issue for the Government of Indonesia"}}
