{"speech":{"0":" It is with great pleasure that I congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I also pay tribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Harri Holkeri. I renew my respects the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the notable and courageous way in which he has continued to fulfil his mandate and for the well-deserved award of the Nobel Peace Prize to him and to the United Nations. to 17 My Belgian colleague has already addressed the Assembly on behalf of the 15 States members of the European Union in a statement with which my country aligns itself completely. I would, however, like to reflect upon certain issues on the international agenda. First, I cannot fail to refer to the tragic terrorist attacks of 11 September against the United States, and in particular against the city of New York and innocent citizens of many nationalities. I reiterate our deep sorrow and reaffirm our complete solidarity with all those who, like us Portuguese, were victimized by the loss of their compatriots and by the suffering of the bereaved families. We are dealing with violence without a face, violence that kills indiscriminately and that must be confronted by the international community as a whole, irrespective of the religion we practice, the race to which we belong, the ideology we follow or the civilization into which we were born. It falls to each and every State Member of the United Nations to fight this scourge, whose blind hatred has plunged the world into a state of turmoil not seen since the end of the Second World War. What is most shocking to us is the fact that we are faced with a force that ignores or despises the very concept of the right to life. We must embark on a concerted effort at all levels to submit to justice those guilty of the crimes committed, with a view to avoiding a repetition of the terrorist acts of September. We believe the United Nations has an irreplaceable role to play as the source of the international community in the fight against this common enemy. It is for other forums to complement these actions, orienting and adjusting in accordance with the concrete needs of their respective mandates. the collective effort of legitimacy them for In this context, I would like to recall that Portugal has supported without reservation the international fight against terrorism here in the United Nations, in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union, in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and in our bilateral relations with the United States and other countries. I would its presidency of the OSCE next year, Portugal will attribute particular priority to this matter. the Assembly to assure like that in in In the light of the current circumstances, I must range of importance of the entire the stress 18 or produced, legislation international awaiting approval, under the aegis of the United Nations in the area of the fight against terrorism: the 12 conventions whose ratification and implementation make them crucial weapons in preventing and fighting against this scourge. Because of its particular significance at this time, I refer specifically to the work of the General Assembly on the draft global convention on terrorism. The great efforts made by the great majority of delegations in search of compromise solutions bear witness to a renewed convergence of wills in pursuit of this common goal. We should take advantage of the current momentum of collective commitment to reach the speedy completion of this essential instrument. to fully implementing terrorism and Portugal has already signed 11 of the 12 is international conventions against strongly committed their provisions. Yesterday we deposited our instrument of ratification for the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, and shortly we will deposit our instrument of ratification for the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation. We welcome the adoption of Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), which are fundamental instruments for international community in its legitimate fight against terrorism. I would also like to highlight the measures contained therein for the fight against terrorist financing — an absolutely crucial area. the cohesion of the As I have already stated, Portugal has supported from the beginning the international campaign under way in Afghanistan, which has been legitimized by the deliberations of the United Nations. Those responsible for the terrorist acts that claimed the lives of thousands of innocent civilians on 11 September must be captured and tried, and their military infrastructure must be eliminated. In our view, the principles guiding the intervention the preservation of territorial integrity and the unity of the country, as well as the establishment of a broadly supported, representative Government. in Afghanistan multi-ethnic include should and We believe that, from the very start, the Afghan people should be associated with the reconstruction of their country, which has been devastated in recent years by recognized internationally. The international community should a brutal is not regime that spare no efforts in alleviating the serious humanitarian situation affecting the Afghan people. the supports Finally, let me reiterate that the Portuguese Government unequivocally efforts undertaken by the United Nations, and in particular by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Lakdar Brahimi, in envisioning a transitional governmental structure and in planning a possible United Nations mission on the ground. In a post- Taliban scenario, the United Nations will be called upon to take a decisive role in the reconstruction of Afghanistan as well as in the establishment of peaceful relations between Afghanistan and its neighbours. The United Nations plays an indispensable role in the prevention of conflicts, the maintenance of international peace and security and the reconstruction of territories devastated by war. Numerous conflicts are awaiting resolution and constitute a considerable challenge to the international communitys capacity to guarantee their peaceful and definitive settlement. risk. The The situation in the Middle East, specifically in the most worrisome, placing even Palestine, is security at international international community can spare no efforts to ensure that Israel and the Palestinians return to the path of dialogue. Only there will a solution be found that is just, both for the Palestinian people — who have fought for decades for the recognition of their homeland, an inalienable living and undeniable conditions within a responsible Palestinian State — and for Israel, which has an equal right to live in security in the region and at peace with its neighbours. sovereign and for dignified right, and in Angola and the armed conflict As another example of international conflicts that drag on, apparently with no definitive resolution in sight, my country profoundly regrets the continuation its severe of humanitarian consequences. Portugal reaffirms its commitment to and support for the search for a political solution to this problem, in line with the provisions of the Acordos de Paz, the Lusaka Protocol and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. It is essential that the commitments undertaken with regard to the international community, and principally with regard to the Angolan people, be respected. Portugal encourages to redouble its efforts to achieve national reconciliation. We also encourage the introduction of political and the Angolan Government reforms in particular to economic its reinforcing the representative and pluralistic the strengthening of the credibility of its monetary and financial structures. in Angola, with a view legitimacy of institutions and We also appeal for a return to political means on the part of those — such as the sector that inspires the more radical line of UNITA — that have resorted to methods, namely violence against civilians, that have placed them outside the international community. In fact, the absence of constructive proposals — including with regard to a ceasefire or the cessation of offensive operations — the implementation of possible platforms for dialogue, which the current situation demands. important increasing contribution made by Angolan society, particularly its churches, to peace and reconciliation. We believe that a United Nations presence in Angola continues to be essential and should be encouraged. We praise contribute does not to the and In that vein, I would like to actively encourage the Secretary-General to intensify all possible efforts to relaunch the peace process in Angola with a view to the adequate implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, so that that great country can finally guarantee tranquillity to its citizens and recover its standing and the role to which it is entitled in international life, fully taking part the African renaissance. I am certain that the troika of observer States, as well as the African regional organizations and the European Union, will firmly support the contribution of the Secretary-General to a definitive resolution of the Angolan issue. the objectives of in achieving When the international community successfully intervenes in a conflict, it should not be turned aside from the consolidation of the solutions reached. The United Nations has the responsibility of maintaining an appropriate level of involvement until the definitive conclusion of the peace process, so as not to put at risk the investments made and expectations created. The United Nations should proceed without hesitation in supporting the creation of viable nations. I welcome the Security Councils endorsement of this understanding with regard to East Timor, on 31 October. The international community cannot neglect the consolidation of the solutions achieved in East Timor, whose transition to independence is, in fact, a clear case of success for the United Nations and a 19 special reason for pride for the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries. I take this opportunity to underline that this entire process has been conducted in an exemplary manner by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor under the leadership of Sergio Vieira de Mello. The work of the United Nations towards the consolidation of a new and indisputably sovereign, democratic and economically viable State only reinforces the credibility of the Organization at a time in international life when its inspiration and leadership are more needed than ever before to correctly manage the great global challenges of the twenty-first century.
