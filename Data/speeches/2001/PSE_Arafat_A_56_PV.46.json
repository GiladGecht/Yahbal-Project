Let us go back to saving the peace process with no conditions and no military pressures.” restrictions on settlement Jewish 29 things, We call on Israel to relinquish Orient House and other Palestinian offices in and around Jerusalem. We also urge it to return to the negotiating table and, among other the proposals contained in the Mitchell Committee report. Israel must release the millions of dollars in tax money owed to the Palestinian Authority in order to alleviate the economic and financial hardships inflicted upon the Palestinian people. implement to In the final analysis, Israels security largely depends on the implementation of the principle of a viable Palestinian State. We hope that the international community will also commit itself to restoring dignity and respect to the Palestinian people. Like all peoples everywhere, they have a right to live in peace and to enjoy a decent existence. In our subregion of the Horn of Africa, there has been some reduction in hostilities despite lingering differences and antagonisms. The people in that area of the world have suffered too long and desire nothing more than a relaxation of tensions, the free movement of people and goods, stability, development and cooperation. It is high time that we devoted our meagre resources to development and to improving the living conditions and meeting the needs of our own people. Let us give our people a break and a better future. lasting peace, Djibouti truly believes in regional cooperation, good-neighbourliness and the opportunities they can afford for all our people. We are committed to working hand in hand with our friends in the subregion to resolve outstanding issues in complete harmony and trust. As a nation, we are challenged by scant resources and declining international assistance, which have been exacerbated by the huge influx of drought-affected people and economic migrants. Our capital city, in particular, is overburdened by an influx of people displaced by drought or political tensions in the region, thus further straining our limited infrastructure and social services. We appeal international community to help us overcome these unsustainable challenges and pressures that have been with us for too long and are beyond our limited means. (spoke in French): I would like to begin by congratulating the President on his outstanding election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. His election reflects the recognition by the international community of the Mr. Ping (Gabon) to the 30 place and the role that the Republic of Korea, a great friend of Gabon, plays in the world and particularly in Asia. I would like to assure him of our full cooperation during his period of office. To his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, I express the satisfaction of my delegation for the excellent work done in the course of the last session. And to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, I would like to reaffirm the highest appreciation of the Government and the head of State of Gabon, His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, for the dedication and determination with which he has endeavoured to make a reality of the ideals of peace, justice and welfare contained in the United Nations Charter. The Nobel Peace Prize, which has just been awarded to him as well as to the United Nations, is eloquent testimony to the work being done by the United Nations system to promote peace and build a more prosperous world. He can rest assured of Gabons support for his efforts in the service of the United Nations. It is little more than a year ago that the heads of State and Government of the Member States of the United Nations met here in New York at the historic Millennium Summit. On that occasion, they laid down the guidelines for the future work of the international community and reaffirmed their commitment to the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter of our Organization. The Millennium Summit thus enabled our nations to renew their commitment to act in unity and solidarity in order to take up the numerous challenges facing the world. The tragedy which took place on 11 September 2001 in the United States of America has, more than ever, strengthened our determination to combat international terrorism. We must put an end to it by all possible means — military, diplomatic and political. It is for this reason that Gabon unreservedly supports Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) as well as the adoption of a comprehensive convention on terrorism. There is no possible doubt that the coalition which has been created will be victorious in the fight against terrorism. In this surge of solidarity, the international community must, find appropriate responses to the world problems that can serve as a pretext for certain radical groups. There is an urgent need to act to find solutions to the conflicts and economic and social problems of our time. in parallel, As far as armed conflicts are concerned, we are convinced that if illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons could be ended, it would be easier to arrive at a prompt and lasting settlement. The implementation by everyone of the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, held here in New York last July, would enable us to reach that goal. Faithful to the commitment of President Omar Bongo, Gabon remains committed to and involved in efforts to restore peace in the world, particularly in Africa. Here, I would like to express our satisfaction at the return of peace to Congo (Brazzaville) following a national dialogue involving all parties, under the auspices of the international mediator. The stability which has been restored to this brother country has made possible the voluntary return of the numerous Congolese refugees from my country to their homes since August, thanks to excellent cooperation between the High Commissioner for Refugees, the Gabonese authorities and the Congolese authorities. Similarly, we welcome the significant progress that has been made in the Burundi peace process, which on 1 November 2001 culminated transitional government. the establishment of a in I would like to pay deserved tribute to former President Nelson Mandela for the dedication and determination with which he conducted the process to that important stage. For his part, the President of the Gabonese Republic will, at the request of the members of the Burundi Peace Initiative, pursue his efforts with a view to consolidating the peace process in that country. in Concerning the situation the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we welcome the important efforts already undertaken in establishing the United Nations peacekeeping mission. We earnestly hope that the Johannesburg phase will make possible the start of an effective inter-Congolese dialogue. The situation in the Middle East, because of the threat it presents to international peace and security, is also a source of deep concern. I therefore urge the parties to resume negotiations, the only way to arrive at a lasting peace. At the very moment when the process of globalization of financial markets and trade is affecting every aspect of the life of our societies, one must resources taken on their behalf. The recognize that an ever-growing number of the worlds peoples risk being marginalized if concrete measures are not international community therefore needs to mobilize new and additional to narrow considerably the gap separating them from others. The forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development, scheduled for March 2002 at Monterrey, Mexico, accordingly arouses great hopes. If this important conference is well prepared, it will help us to satisfy these legitimate expectations. to enable them Leaders have understood that Africa holds the key to its own development. The creation of the African Union and the New Partnership for Africas Development are part of this logic. Much remains to be done for development to blossom, but the foundations have already been laid. To achieve full success, however, Africa needs the assistance of the United Nations and the international community. Another question vital to our planets future at the beginning of the third millennium is that of the protection and preservation of the environment. The World Summit on Sustainable Development, which is to be held in Johannesburg from 2 to 11 September 2002, will provide us a further opportunity to evaluate the progress made in implementing policies reflecting the commitments we undertook in Rio de Janeiro 10 years ago. What conclusions will we be able to draw as to the implementation of Agenda 21? What chance of success will we be prepared to give the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification Countries Experiencing Serious Drought anor Desertification, and the Convention on Biodiversity? In other words, what we must do is to respond more simply and directly to the issue of the choices and concessions we are prepared to make to be able to pass on to future generations a preserved environment that is similar to the heritage we ourselves received from our fathers. Those in tuberculosis, malaria and, not Any efforts made by the countries of Africa to ensure better economic growth will be in vain if no large-scale effort is mounted against such diseases as HIAIDS, to be forgotten, arterial hypertension, which is another of the main causes of death in Africa. There is therefore an urgent need the United Nations recommendations on AIDS, particularly with regard to care, support and treatment. There is also an urgent implement to 31 need to make operational the special Trust Fund created for that purpose. the United States. In particular, I wish to express my condolences to the families of the victims. At a time when the United Nations, and in particular the Security Council — the body primarily responsible for the maintenance of peace in the world — is increasingly called upon to take on the numerous challenges posed by the third millennium, the matter of reforming that body continues to be highly relevant. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive how a continent like Africa can be without permanent representation on the Council. is found in to be The reality of todays world, divided between universalism and particular interests and identities, clearly illustrates that humanity is still searching for harmony and unity. That is why we are firmly convinced that a solution to the concerns I have just mentioned international communitys promotion of the virtues of dialogue and solidarity, which are the pillars of the new humanism. Without respect for those values, the dream cherished by the founders of our Organization to build a peaceful and united world will remain a chimera. Working towards establishing a new humanity free from selfishness, hatred, passions and injustice must constitute our common concern. the "}}
