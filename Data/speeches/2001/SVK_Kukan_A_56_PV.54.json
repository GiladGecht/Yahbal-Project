{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, I wish to join other speakers in warmly congratulating you, Sir, on your election as President of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. It is my deep conviction that in this difficult situation we will, under your experienced leadership, materialize the expectations of the international community, which has always desired to view the United Nations as a reliable guarantor of world peace. I recall our recent meeting in Seoul, and it is a pleasure for me to see you, Sir, presiding over the General Assembly this year. I also wish to thank your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for his hard work, dedication and leadership in presiding over the fifty- fifth session of the General Assembly. The recent brutal terrorist attack against our host country, which has left all of us in deep shock, was undoubtedly also directed against the United Nations and its principles and values, which we as Member States share. This inhuman act was an attack on all of us. However, it has united the international community, which realized the potential danger and threat of terrorism to the existence of human civilization. The international community has responded in the only way appropriate: international terrorism cannot be tolerated; all the nations of the world must stand united in the battle against this evil; and they have to search vigorously for ways to effectively respond to it. We were relieved to see the United Nations acting promptly and in a very determined way, adopting the very next day General Assembly and Security Council resolutions urging the international community to redouble its efforts to prevent and suppress terrorist acts by increased cooperation and full implementation of the relevant international anti-terrorist conventions and Security Council In particular, Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) is of a great importance and must be fully implemented. resolutions. and international organizations We appreciate that after the terrorist attacks, countries have manifested moral maturity and their capacity to closely cooperate and coordinate their actions in the fight against world terrorism. We welcome the active and irreplaceable role the United Nations plays in this fight. As United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan explicitly stated in his response to the arrogant and disdainful words of bin Laden addressed to the United Nations, people will understand that the position of the United Nations is the expression of the will of all its Members. international A year ago, many of my colleagues and I elaborated on the role of the United Nations in combating terrorism. The Slovak Republic joined the anti-terrorist coalition swiftly, effectively and without any hesitation. It will remain a firm part of the coalition of nations and people resolved to fight terrorism and determined to face this threat to peace and security on our planet. The Slovak Republic is a party to 11 of the 12 universal anti- terrorist conventions. Shortly, we hope to ratify the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, which we signed last January. We call on all other countries to redouble their efforts in order comprehensive convention against terrorism. to achieve a speedy conclusion of a is a necessity the world. A The terrorist attack has certainly changed our re-assessment of perception of international arrangements this context. After a period of mostly emotional reactions, we now need more qualified answers, supported by resolve and responsibility. I am convinced that the resolve and responsibility will be into executive actions and systemic steps by the United Nations. translated in the effectiveness of The legal instruments devised here at the United for Nations constitute an especially good basis deepening the fight against terrorism. Using the words of the aphorist Blaise Pascal, I want to emphasize that the only thing that remains to be done is to implement all the good principles that have already been laid down. It is encouraging that the words of comfort and the ideas and commitments uttered by high representatives of the Member States of this, the most universal international community, overwhelmingly share that spirit. Slovakia fully associates itself with those views. In that context, we wish to express our hope that the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court will enter into force sometime next year. With international community will be establishing a body that will end impunity for crimes of the greatest seriousness, including crimes against humanity. that the Slovakia The world has a unique opportunity to achieve progress in tackling long-lasting conflicts through joint efforts. considers United Nations peacekeeping operations to be one of the key and most visible aspects of the Organizations activities. We view all United Nations activities in conflict prevention, peacekeeping, peace support and peace- building as particularly important. It is the people in the regions suffering from conflict who look to our Organization with hope, and we must not let them down. As a country that is materially and personally involved, we welcome with great attention and devotion and participate actively in the discussions aimed at reforming and improving the efficiency of United Nations peacekeeping. We are ready to continue contributing our share in every possible way to this noble endeavour. The participation of the Slovak Republic in United Nations peacekeeping operations 7 has grown almost six-fold since the beginning of the year 2000. This year we took part in the United Nations mission in East Timor, where we deployed a level II hospital. In Cyprus the Slovak contingent has replaced Austria and has become the lead nation in Sector 4. We have sent our demining experts and other personnel to the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea. that area must stay multi-ethnic and I would also like to add my personal note to this description of my countrys engagement. For the past two years, the Secretary-General has entrusted me with an exceptionally demanding and responsible task, namely, to serve as his Special Envoy for the Balkans and to oversee the peaceful resolution of the still- smouldering conflict in Kosovo. I am aware of the critical importance of the coming elections to be held in Kosovo under the supervision of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). I am now therefore in a position to state a single critical thesis: the international community must continue to be consistent in its policies on the matter. that is experiencing dynamic development and one that shares a great interest in stable international development and the prosperity of the international community, Slovakia also has an ambition to play a more visible role in the United Nations. Our Prime Minister, Mikulas Dzurinda, also clearly expressed our position on many other topics and challenges at last years Millennium Summit. The spirit of the commendable initiatives adopted at the Summit will produce the best results only through their unrestricted practical implementation, although new and unprecedented barriers have emerged on the way. As a country Our position on the issue of Security Council reform is linked to the importance of making the Organization more effective. Let us be honest and admit that we have not been fully successful in achieving this goal for years, and that we will now have to cope with new and unprecedented challenges. In my letter to the previous President of the General Assembly I emphasized that, in addition to maintaining sufficient representativeness, the Security Council should also preserve sufficient operational flexibility. We also believe that the Security Council should base its decision-making on majority voting, and that the right of veto should only be reserved for decisions taken under Chapter VII of the Charter. 8 Slovakia supports the enlargement of the Security Council in both the non-permanent and the permanent categories of membership. However, the failure to achieve consensus on the enlargement of one category should not result in blocking enlargement in another category. I avail myself of this opportunity to confirm that while increasing the number of Security Council members in the category of elected non-permanent members, we consider it fully justified to allocate one additional seat to the Group of Eastern European States. Its membership has doubled in the last decade. Exceptionally urgent current challenges have cast a malicious shadow of destruction over this years agenda of the General Assembly, which I have not commented on in detail. I would like, however, to assure the Assembly that Slovakia believes in the need for a universal world organization — which the United Nations is — as a source of hope for a better and more just world. We have no doubts about the irreplaceable role of the United Nations in tackling global issues, be it the protection of human rights, the eradication of famine, poverty, diseases and the prevention of drug and arms proliferation or guaranteeing sustainable development. A life of dignity for all of us is really unthinkable without the enduring involvement of it requires universal respect of its paramount place in international life, and joint cooperation in intensifying its activities. the United Nations. However, illiteracy or In conclusion, I would like to underline the feeling of deep satisfaction of my country, and me personally, with the appointment of Mr. Kofi Annan to serve a second term as the United Nations Secretary- General. I also wish to voice our recognition of the honour given to him personally and to our universal world Organization through the prestigious and well- deserved award of the centenary Nobel Peace Prize, and this achievement. to congratulate him wholeheartedly on "}}
