{"speech":{"0":" The sudden speeding up of events that has taken place since the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly and their potential impact on the future of humankind only confirms our impression that our world is experiencing developments that could, one the one hand, open the door to hopes for peace, stability and progress, or, on the other, jeopardize these hopes and imperil prospects for a better world. The threat is real. We therefore must mobilize our efforts to an even greater extent to ensure that the ideals of peace, solidarity, justice and tolerance can triumph throughout the world. Hatred and intolerance took centre stage on 11 September, when the United States, our host country, was the target of terrorist acts of indescribable and unjustifiable barbarity. In the face of the outrage and horror to which those events gave rise, the President of the Republic of Togo immediately condemned these heinous attacks, which he called a veritable declaration of war, and which, regrettably, caused the death of nationals of nearly 80 countries, including mine. Once again, in paying tribute to all of those who lost their lives in the tragedy of 11 September and in conveying once again our deep condolences to the American people, I should like to express the fervent hope that, thanks to our collective efforts and to a greater solidarity in our actions, we will be able to defeat evil. terrorist acts, Togo Because we have on several occasions been the victims of the significance and seriousness of the consequences of such acts of murderous violence, which are committed with complete disregard for respect for human life and for human dignity. is aware of The joint combat against international terrorism, in all its manifestations and wherever necessary, is a task of great importance for the entire international community, because no one is safe from this scourge. This fight should not be understood as a confrontation between civilizations, cultures or religions. Identifying the true causes of this scourge and finding appropriate solutions to combat it — this is the true challenge that we must meet. In this context, it is important to do everything we can to ensure the broadest possible participation of States in the strict application of the 12 international conventions dealing with specific aspects of terrorism and to step up negotiations on the comprehensive convention on international terrorism. Likewise, it is essential for all States to cooperate closely with the mechanism has been set up by the Security Council pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001) in order to combat this scourge in an efficient and coordination manner. My country is already complying with its responsibilities in the context of this process. 11 However, cooperation in eradicating this scourge needs to be strengthened at the regional level as well. Thus our West African subregion notes with satisfaction that it has set up functional structures to combat terrorism, through the quadripartite agreement between Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria; and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Protocol on Mutual Assistance, Protocol on Non-Aggression and Protocol relating the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management, Resolution, Peacekeeping and Security. to Before continuing my statement, I should like to join my voice to those of previous speakers in extending to Mr. Han, on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, our warmest congratulations on his election as President of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that, thanks to his experience and diplomatic skills, the work of this session will definitely be successful. I should like also to extend my warmest congratulations to his illustrious predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, who so ably guided the work of the fifty-fifth session. Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to pay well-deserved tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan. Thanks to his skill and his vision, our Organization has regained its credibility and its primary role in the management of international affairs. His unanimous re-election to a second term of office, and the fact that he won the Nobel Peace Prize for 2001 together with the United Nations, attest clearly to the great confidence that the entire international community places in him. There cannot be economic progress nor sustainable development outside an environment of peace, security and stability. Togos foreign policy has always been based on the principle of seeking peace, stability and solidarity between nations. Since coming to power, the President of our Republic, Mr. Gnassingbe Eyadema, has worked to consolidate peace. This requires the participation of all citizens in political life as well as the construction of a state that is truly based on the rule of law, in which all individuals can make their contribution and use their skills in the building of a prosperous nation. The President had already begun to democratize political life in Togo by the 1980s. Like any other human endeavour, the promotion of democracy and 12 good governance and the consolidation of the rule of law are part of a process that, by necessity, can be perfected and can evolve and that fits in a given time and place. to express our profound With various forms of support and aid from our foreign partners, this process is taking its course and registering tangible and real progress. We should like here to all our international partners who have supported us in our ambition to pursue and achieve political reforms necessary to consolidate democracy and rule of law in Togo. thanks The upcoming legislative elections, in March 2002, are organized with the aim of making this ambition more of a reality. In this regard, we are grateful to the United Nations for having recently sent an to make recommendations in light of these elections. The long- awaited upcoming legislative elections, as well as the proper conduct of the balloting, will, without a doubt, contribute to boosting the economy of our country. assessment mission to Togo For it is true that progress made in pursuing any process of democratization and establishing the rule of law can be protected only if accompanied by a significant improvement in the living conditions of the populations concerned. In other words, to be lasting, the advances in promoting civil and political rights and fundamental liberties should absolutely be underpinned by the real enjoyment of economic and social rights. In such a context, we may well be surprised at the unjustified continuation of the economic sanctions imposed on Togo by our main partners in development for almost 10 years. What has my country done to deserve such a fate? What has the Togolese population done to justify its daily suffering? Why apply this policy of double standards? Given the way Togo is being treated, are we to see this as an concrete illustration of the views of the renowned, classic French writer Jean de la Fontaine: “Depending on whether you are powerful or weak, the judgement of the court will make you white or black”? The Togolese people still cannot understand why Togo — which was one of the first countries in Africa to be committed to the path of democratization and political reforms and which, in all objectivity, made progress in this area — continues to be subjected to such injustice. I would like to make once again an urgent appeal, on behalf of the Togolese Government and people, for normalization of our cooperative relations with our development partners. Peace, security and stability in Africa are still at the heart of our concerns. We note with satisfaction that significant progress in settling conflicts has recently been made on the continent. I would cite by way of example the cessation of conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, or the gradual return to normal constitutional life in Comores, despite the vicissitudes of the last few days. All this was made possible thanks to the efforts of the Organization of African Unity, the Organization of la Francophonie and the League of Arab States. These are glimmers of hope and signs of relief. Nonetheless, must remains to be done to bring about lasting peace and security in certain parts of the continent, notably in the Mano River region, the Horn of Africa, the Great Lakes Region and Angola. The serious crisis endures in the Middle East. Violence can only beget bitterness and resentment and perpetuate violence. The hellish cycle of violence that the region has known for already more than a year — in particular, in the occupied Palestinian territories — has certainly had an impact on the negotiations being pursued with a view to reaching a just, final and comprehensive settlement to the question of Palestine that is at the heart of the conflict. It is therefore important that the parties in conflict show greater proof of the necessary political will in applying the agreements that have been reached and work to conclude other arrangements on the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions. In this respect, Togo welcomes the positive developments that have been recently made with respect to the evolution of the position of certain Member States on the creation of a Palestinian State. Humanity has fully entered twenty-first century, but the economic and social position of developing countries remains of concern. In sub- Saharan Africa and in the least-developed countries in particular, we are witnessing an ongoing deterioration of unprecedented marginalization of these countries — a situation that can only exacerbate misery and extreme poverty. conditions living and the the Debt burden, the decline in export earnings and the lack of sufficient resources for development have greatly contributed to making social and economic conditions worse. Therefore more resources must be these allocated insurmountable difficulties, we now have the pandemics of AIDS and malaria. these areas. In addition to to in hand, expects to make good on Africa, which is already organizing itself and the international taking matters community the commitments undertaken at the Millennium Summit. Against this background, we hope that the major encounters that will take place in 2002 — the International Conference on Financing for Development and the World Summit on Sustainable Development — will be opportunities to take can genuinely contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction. We also hope that specific and substantial support will be given to Africa in implementing its development plan, as contained for Development in Africa. appropriate measures the New Partnership that in At the start of the millennium, with great changes underway in the world, the United Nations still is, without a doubt, the centre for new hopes and expectations of humanity. More than ever before, it has shown itself to be the appropriate framework in which, together, we can and must work to meet the numerous and complex challenges that humanity faces in the context of an inexorable process of globalization. increasingly While continuing to work to maintain peace and security, promote sustainable economic development and move towards eradicating the great pandemics, we also must confront poverty, injustice, selfishness and exclusion, which, it seems to me, still are the source of many problems that often lead to acts of violence, terrorism and armed conflict. Thus, and only thus, will it be possible for us to establish a new international order of greater justice, solidarity and humanity. Mr. Gatti (San Marino) (spoke in Italian; English text provided by the delegation): On behalf of the Government of the Republic of San Marino, I wish to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session and to thank his predecessor for his valuable contribution. I would also like to congratulate the Secretary- General, who was recently re-elected for a second term. Over the past five years, my country has greatly appreciated his efficiency, charisma and excellent diplomatic ability. 13 In expressing its most sincere satisfaction, the Republic of San Marino congratulates the United Nations and its Secretary-General on having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this Organizations ongoing commitment to peace and irreplaceable role and of its leaders outstanding diplomatic skills and dedication, which have always characterized his fruitful activity. Quite understandably, these days the General Assembly is debating and wondering how and why the world could change in just a few hours and how the process of civilization of the international community could be so ferociously attacked. We have gathered in the most important international forum to define the role to be played by each country, individually or multilaterally, and to determine how this daunting and insidious challenge can be faced by each and everyone of us. Our discussions should also focus on how to adjust our national legal systems to better support a resolute fight against any form of international terrorism, strengthen our defence systems and promote a common culture of solidarity and firm condemnation of any violation of and attack on human rights and civil co-existence, the respect and safeguard of which are crucial. However, at a time of enormous difficulties, when the wave of hatred and violence seems to be inexorable, the international community is sending a strong signal of hope by showing its determination not to bend to people who, acting underground, try to spread terror and turmoil by any possible means. Large and small countries alike have joined forces to combat terrorism and have expressed their full solidarity with the United States outstanding example of democracy and liberty. To the United States and the families of the victims, I wish to express my deepest sympathies and condolences. Almost all countries have seen the attack on the United States as an attack on each of them. That explains why, in the face of such tragedies, many small nations, too, such as the Republic I represent today, cannot remain neutral by simply offering solidarity or making statements of principles. Each and every one of us is called upon to offer a determined and timely contribution, however small, the fight against terrorism, which my country has always condemned in all international forums as the main threat to peace. to 14 In this spirit, San Marino immediately expressed its willingness to collaborate with the United States of America and to fully comply with Security Council resolutions, in particular resolutions 1333 (2000) of 19 December 2000 and 1373 (2001) of 28 September 2001. This decision was motivated not only by the fact that our Republic has been a Member of this Organization for almost a decade, but above all by its inherent vocation to promote peace and respect for human rights, prompted by the conviction, matured over 1,700 years of peace and liberty, that any effort in this direction helps to create and maintain international co-existence and mutual respect. it has adopted The Republic of San Marino will spare no effort in the global fight against terrorism, as it has already done to prevent and combat money-laundering. To that end, legislative instruments and effective domestic measures and has actively participated in the action carried out in this field by major international organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund, the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. the necessary My country has successfully integrated many international provisions aimed at countering terrorism and intends to proceed to the ratification, as soon as possible, of those instruments that are not yet part of its legal system. Indeed, San Marino is well aware of the importance and effectiveness of international law, which has been expressly designed to promote cooperation in this field. In this context, the proposal submitted by India on a comprehensive anti-terrorism convention should be taken into consideration as, today more than ever, this is a very topical issue that deserves our greatest attention. At the beginning of this new century, mankind cannot and must not move backwards. That would be extremely dangerous, as it would challenge the state of civilization that mankind has worked so strenuously to achieve. All free spirits must do their utmost to avert this potential defeat and embark on the path of solidarity, cooperation and mutual understanding. I would also like to convey the hope expressed by the Government of San Marino and major institutional bodies for intensified activity by the United Nations, in the conviction the the numerous Organization is needed international challenges from todays that a more active role of face that, aside to exceptional circumstances, are still at the top of the world political agenda. I On this occasion, feel duty-bound to congratulate the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly for having implemented, with great determination and courage, a major programme of reforms aimed at strengthening the United Nations, well aware of that only a continuous modernization process will enable the Organization to work effectively and to keep abreast of future developments. the fact In this regard, San Marino has repeatedly stressed the need for a reformed Security Council that, in better reflecting the new world order, would guarantee a higher degree of representativeness, democracy and transparency. We believe that such prerogatives can be ensured by simply increasing the number of non- permanent members. Moreover, San Marino hopes that the right of veto may be gradually restricted with a view to its eventual elimination. Indeed, my country is convinced that the exercise of that right, or the mere threat of its exercise, still represents a major obstacle to the proper functioning of the Organization. Equally important is the ongoing revitalization process of the General Assembly. The progress that has been achieved in terms of greater efficiency makes us believe that the General Assembly will regain its status as the major decision-making and representative body of the United Nations. My country hopes that the Ad Hoc Working Group, open to all Member States, will carry on this revitalization process. In consideration of the pivotal role of the United Nations in fostering international peace and security, the Republic of San Marino is of the opinion that this Organization is the most appropriate negotiating forum at the disposal of the community of nations. Besides carefully following the Security Councils efforts to address the latest events, my country has paid great attention to the Councils ongoing commitment to settling the conflicts afflicting Africa. Today more than ever, we believe that the immediate implementation of that bodys decisions is crucial to restoring peace in a geographical area already stricken by poverty, epidemics and underdevelopment. San Marino is also seriously concerned about the escalation of violence and the increased hostilities in the Middle East and hopes that, in that tormented and contested land, dialogue and negotiations can be resumed as the sine qua non of a longed-for world reconciliation. Against the phenomenon of globalization also deserves careful consideration. I am not referring exclusively to its economic and commercial implications, though these are its most tangible components. international backdrop, todays job opportunities and, eventually, Market expansion and the progressive abolition of customs barriers have unquestionably contributed to exporting to economic well-being. On the other hand, however, the gap between the living conditions and standards of the North and the South, of the industrialized countries vis- a-vis the developing and least developed ones, which are also burdened by huge foreign debt, has widened dramatically. That gap must be immediately bridged in order to guarantee the globalization of opportunities along with the globalization of markets. We have all witnessed the anti-globalization demonstrations in Seattle, Prague and, more recently, Genoa. Paradoxically, both the participants in the summits and the demonstrators were striving for the same objectives: poverty eradication, foreign debt relief greater environmental protection. I believe that the existence of common objectives is a first step in the direction of an open and constructive exchange of views. developing countries and for The Republic of San Marino also maintains that poverty alleviation is one of the major challenges facing the international community for the immediate future. Future projects should address not only the lack of access to consumer goods, but also the lack of education, liberty and participation in decision-making. In this broader context, poverty is an insurmountable obstacle to the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Recently published data dramatically show that more than 1.5 billion people live on less than $2 per day, and at least two thirds are illiterate; 830 million people suffer from severe malnutrition, and 750 million are homeless, without access to health care. Moreover, how can we ignore the fact that hundreds of millions of children are suffering from malnutrition, that 30,000 children under five years of age are dying every day and that more than 500 million of them live on less than $1 per day? 15 Well aware of the dramatic situation of many developing countries, the Republic of San Marino has fully supported the initiatives sponsored by creditor countries and international financial institutions to reduce or cancel foreign debts of highly indebted nations. Though not sufficient to mitigate the problem of poverty or to stop the vicious cycle of misery, these initiatives reflect the will of both creditor and debtor countries to find jointly a solution for the scourge of poverty and to share responsibilities. It is not utopian to think that, by addressing and solving the problems of hunger, poverty and the disproportionate social, economic and cultural gaps between a minority the North and an overwhelming, poor and despairing majority living in the South, terrorism will also be wiped out in the near future. Indeed, poverty and ideological extremism serve as fertile soil for terrorism, with its destructive potential and toll in human lives. living in Once again, the Holy Father has rightly called on all States and peoples to struggle for justice, since this is the only way to affirm the pre-eminence of law for the international community. Throughout its long and glorious history of freedom, San Marino has always fully shared this ideal. Prompted by these sentiments and determined to further support progressive international detente, for the benefit of both nations and individuals, I reiterate the hope of the Republic of San Marino that the international community, recognized ability of the United Nations system, will be able to give new impetus to the principles of dialogue and cooperation upon which it is based. through the "}}
