{"speech":{"0":" I am pleased to begin by extending to Mr. Han Seung-soo and through him to his friendly country, the Republic of Korea, our warmest congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty- sixth session. I wish him every success in his tasks during the session. I would also like to convey our sincere thanks to his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for the skill and efficiency with which he conducted the work of this Assembly during the past session. I am also pleased on behalf of my country to renew our sincere congratulations to Secretary-General Kofi Annan on his unanimous re-election to continue his noble mission. We congratulate him and the United Nations on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. is anxious about the consequences of This session is taking place at a time when the world the atrocious terrorist acts that struck the United States on 11 September. We have strongly condemned these acts and reiterate our condolences to the friendly American people and the families of the victims at this difficult time. States were unanimous in the recently adopted Security Council and General Assembly resolutions in emphasizing the need to combat terrorism with all determination in order to uproot and prevent this scourge. Since the early 1990s, Tunisia has warned against the dangers of terrorism. It has called for adopting the necessary measures at the national, regional and international levels to fight this phenomenon with all available means. Today, we reiterate our earlier statements. It is important to develop cooperation among States to fight terrorism, by taking all necessary and strong measures to implement Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). This should apply to those who abet directly or in perpetrating terrorist acts in their countries of origin or elsewhere. All acts of terrorism must be condemned without double standards, particularly with respect to the granting of political asylum or residency. Tunisia(cid:146)s belief in the necessity of adopting such measures has spared it the presence of extremist elements and terrorism on its territory. indirectly or are involved If we are to develop international cooperation in this field, we will need to enhance approved legal 35 norms. This can be done through a comprehensive international treaty allowing for a comprehensive plan of action. In the same vein, Tunisia supports the convening of an international conference against terrorism. The conference would identify the legal framework and machinery needed the international community from the dangers of this scourge. to protect the bases of In Tunisia(cid:146)s view, the struggle against and eventual elimination of terrorism requires the adoption of a comprehensive approach that makes prevention and the identification of the root causes of this phenomenon the methodology of international efforts. It is also necessary to consider the international circumstances that influence and promote the increase in terrorism. This will allow us to find the appropriate approach to ending the spread of this phenomenon and its existence. In this context, it is imperative that we address all aspects that lead to feelings of injustice, the absence of justice, deprivation and marginalization. This will prevent suspicious parties from exploiting these feelings to fuel extremism and terrorism. There is no doubt that the United Nations and the General Assembly in particular have an effective role to play in clarifying that vision. to the Any stress approach comprehensive interdependence fighting terrorism must and interaction between stability, security and peace, on the one hand, and development and progress on the other. The Millennium Summit, which brought together the most important assembly of heads of State and Government in the history of our Organization and provided a unique opportunity to discuss the state of international affairs in all its aspects, stressed that linkage. It highlighted to formulate an international strategy and operational plans to achieve the unanimously agreed objectives specified by the leaders for the next millennium. the need This session is thus especially important in that it provides an opportunity, a year later, to take stock of the principles and objectives approved at the Millennium Summit. It also permits us to develop concerted action based on these principles and objectives. These include a common, cooperative and consensual approach to the problems of our world, be they issues of international peace and security or of development and the eradication of poverty. 36 Solidarity, then, is imperative in the light of the many challenges faced by mankind. In this context, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia has stressed before several regional forums, including the Millennium Summit and the Security Council summit, the importance of solidarity in dealing with poverty, which is one source of tension and crises in societies. We believe that we cannot guarantee stability and security in the world without eliminating all forms of poverty, marginalization and alienation. In this context, President Ben Ali launched his appeal to establish a world fund for solidarity towards the eradication of poverty. to that responded From this rostrum, I extend my sincere thanks to all parties this proposal and participated in the consultations held by the Secretary- General. In this regard, I cannot fail to commend the efforts of the Secretary-General to prepare a positive report, which we hope will be the basis for establishing the fund at this session. We have repeatedly affirmed that the fund will not duplicate existing United Nations bodies concerned with fighting poverty; it will, instead, complement their efforts and provide a means of financing by individuals, institutions or societies, in addition to Governments. These contributions will be deposited in an account to be administered by the United Nations Development Programme. contributions voluntary through From There is no doubt that the strengthening of the foundations of international peace and security is a task entrusted primarily to the Security Council, which in recent weeks has proved particularly effective in its reaction to current developments. We hope that that important body will maintain the same effectiveness in seeking solutions to all international problems. this perspective, developments the Middle East must take priority among the issues before the Council. This is particularly important in view of the continuing instability in the region caused by Israel(cid:146)s intransigence. We call on the Security Council, and especially its permanent members, to play an effective role so as to spare the Middle East from the spectre of an endless conflict, by urging Israel to take urgent measures the Palestinian people. Tunisia reaffirms its initiative, calling for the protection of the Palestinian people through the deployment of international forces in the region. the protection of to ensure in We believe that the only viable option in the Middle East today is a just, lasting and comprehensive peace that guarantees for the Palestinians the return of their land and their legitimate rights, foremost of which is their right to establish an independent State. In this Bush(cid:146)s context, affirmation before the necessity of establishing a Palestinian State. We also reiterate our position on the need for Israeli forces to leave Syrian and Lebanese territory. the General Assembly of Tunisia welcomes President The question of sanctions prompts us to examine our consciences in the light of the suffering it causes civilians. We hope that there will be international consensus to remove the sanctions against Iraq and to deal with the humanitarian issue of missing Kuwaitis and persons from third countries. It is also time once and for all to lift the sanctions imposed against our sister country Libya, which has implemented all its obligations concerning the Lockerbie incident. As a member of the region, Tunisia is working towards more active participation in the Maghreb Union, which aspires to integrate the States of the region by enhancing the structure of the Union and guiding its work, given its function as a strategic option that reflects the will of the people of the region. Tunisia to promote consultation and cooperation in the European-Mediterranean space on the basis of equality, mutual respect, protection of the interests of all parties and their particularities. The aim is to bring about the solid development of the peoples of the two shores of the Mediterranean so as to achieve greater security and stability in the region. is working respect for to to Faithful its commitment the African continent, Tunisia supports new initiatives for Africa and has joined the newly created African Union and will support it with all our capabilities and experience. Respect for the purposes and principles of the Charter only strengthens the action of the Organization in responding to the challenges of development and the maintenance of international peace and security. In this context, we have to strengthen the role of the General Assembly, as an expression of the collective will of its Members and as an embodiment of the concept of democracy in international relations. With regard to the activities of the Security Council, Tunisia, throughout its term of office in the Council, has tried to strengthen the role of this organ by advocating consensus in dealing with the various items on its agenda. This, in our view, will enhance the Council(cid:146)s credibility and will reflect positively on its efficiency. During its presidency of the Council in February 2001, Tunisia adopted a new comprehensive approach to dealing with various cases of instability and crises in the world. Tunisia put forward a proposal for holding a debate on the subject (cid:147)Peace-building: towards a comprehensive approach(cid:148). The result of this debate was a unanimous affirmation by members of the Council of the close connection between peace and development, of the preventive dimension of this approach and of the importance of solidarity in the international community when it comes to taking measures that are necessary for helping countries that are racked by tension and conflict. Within this context, I must stress the need for the reform of the Security Council so as to expand its membership of permanent and non-permanent seats on the basis of equitable geographic distribution that will guarantee the interests of all countries, particularly the developing countries. In contributing operationally to the establishment of peace and security in the world, Tunisia has participated in a number of peacekeeping operations such as its current participation in the United Nations Organization Mission the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) headed by a Tunisian ambassador representing the United Nations. in The elimination of weapons of mass destruction represents one of facing humanity. The importance of the establishment of zones free of weapons of mass destruction, particularly in the Middle East, is to be stressed in this context. the major challenges Technological and scientific advances have dwarfed distances and enabled mankind to score major achievements in numerous fields, such as spread of ideas and bringing people closer to each other. Development, however, has not benefited all peoples, particularly developing countries. The widening of the quantitative gap between industrialized and developing countries is a matter of concern. Concrete measures must be taken to permit all countries to benefit from the technological and information revolution. From this standpoint, we would express the importance that International Tunisia places, since the 37 (ITU) Conference Telecommunication Union in Minneapolis, on hosting the second phase of the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunisia in 2005. We would like to express our gratitude to all countries that have supported us in this. We would also like to express our to Mr. Yoshio Utsumi, ITU Secretary-General, for his constructive role. thanks We hope that the General Assembly will adopt at this session a resolution to begin preparations for this conference in its two phases. We also hope that the work of this conference will lead to the establishment of a true and effective world information partnership between developed and developing countries. Our ability to meet challenges, which we are all facing, including the fight against terrorism, depends on our willingness to channel our efforts towards joint action, based on cooperation, solidarity, tolerance and partnership within the framework of our Organization, which is the ideal place for the realization of our aspirations and for the benefit of all mankind. to Mrs. Mitreva (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia): At the outset, allow me to convey our deepest condolences the American people and Government for today(cid:146)s plane crash and to express our deepest sympathies to the families of the victims for their tragic loss. Our condolences also extend to the people and Government of the Dominican Republic, whose nationals comprised most of those on board. the need effective for more Pleading for concerted action against terrorism and for urgent accession by States to all relevant international conventions, the Millennium Summit anticipated and comprehensive joint efforts and cooperation. The tragic events of 11 September united the world and reaffirmed the resolve of all of us to fight the battle against terrorism, gathered around our common values and interests. That unprecedented terrorist attack took place during the United Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations. The fatal message of terrorism is to destroy the very essence of dialogue as a global response to conflict and violence. By adopting several resolutions, the United Nations demonstrated powerful solidarity and readiness to combat terrorism. Today that has been reaffirmed by Security Council (2001), which adopted a declaration on the global effort to combat terrorism. resolution 1377 38 By expressing its strong condemnation of the attacks and its solidarity with the American people and Government, my country, the Republic of Macedonia, immediately joined the call to establish a global international anti-terrorist coalition. We undertook concrete measures as our contribution to the global efforts and to cooperation to curb terrorist activities. terrorism As a response to terrorism and conscious of the fact transcends borders, we also that proposed the establishment of a regional anti-terrorist pact, stemming from our terrible experience with terrorism over the last eight months. We called upon the international community to cut off financial support for terrorist activities and, in that context, to strengthen the fight against organized crime, aware of the strong link between those evil phenomena. The resolution of regional conflicts is yet another significant contribution we can make to the fight against terrorism. that With regard to relevant international instruments, existing United Nations we believe the conventions provide a legal solid framework for the implementation of many measures intended to eradicate terrorism. While we strongly support the adoption of a comprehensive convention against terrorism and a consensus on a global definition of terrorism, their lack should not prevent us from taking action. international approaches towards acts of Action is needed now, from all of us (cid:151) all countries, regions and international organizations. There is no alternative to international cooperation and partnership, as there is no alternative to the common fight against organized crime, which feeds terrorism. But there is one matter we have to keep in mind: different terrorism undermine our struggle. There is no big or small terrorism, nor international or domestic, nor one that is tolerated and one that is not. No one should be allowed to practice the consequences are equally devastating. We have to defend more vigorously than ever our shared values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. We must not allow ourselves to be manipulated through the use of social, economic, religious and political differences as justification for terrorism. terror; For the past 10 years the Republic of Macedonia has developed a democratic society, a factor of stability in the Balkans. Our model of inter-ethnic relations was set out as an example and was applauded by the international community. Then, eight months ago, Macedonia was exposed to violent terrorist attacks that threatened to undermine all our achievements. Under the cloak of struggling for minority and human rights, the so-called National Liberation Army (NLA) ─ whose structure, command and control and logistics are of Kosovo provenance ─ wanted to realize one aim: the division of Macedonia and changing the borders in the region. to Our response those attacks was military, political and diplomatic. The Framework Agreement of 13 August of this year, which was signed by the leaders of the four main political parties, is a result of our strong commitment to finding a political solution to the crisis as the best way to defend our country and undermine the goals of the terrorists. But let me reiterate that we will also defend our country by other means if necessary. The cost of terrorism for Macedonia was high: lost lives, destroyed homes and thousand of refugees and internally displaced persons. The crisis also caused economic downfall and a large budget deficit. It has had a negative impact on the country(cid:146)s development and has increased unemployment and poverty rates. I therefore urge the international community, financial institutions and, in particular, the European Union to address our needs at the upcoming donors(cid:146) conference and to consider the possibility of writing off our foreign debts. At this point, allow me to underline that the international community gives strong political support to the Republic of Macedonia. The European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and NATO are playing an important role in overcoming the crisis, for which we are grateful. I would also like to commend the prompt reaction by the Security Council. The awareness that the problems in Macedonia were largely inspired in and imported from neighbouring Kosovo resulted in the adoption of resolution 1345 (2001), by which the Council, inter alia, strongly condemned extremist violence, including terrorist activities, and supported the Macedonian Government in its efforts to end the violence in a manner consistent with the rule of law. On 26 September the Council adopted resolution 1371 (2001), which supported the full implementation of the Framework Agreement and rejected the use of violence in pursuit of political goals. Even though the United Nations was not directly involved in the resolution of the crisis in Macedonia, it is present on the ground through its agencies, working in cooperation with the Government to alleviate the consequences. We are grateful for their help, too. the implementation of three policemen and Despite the efforts of the Republic of Macedonia and the international community, attempts are still being made to block the work of the parliament and to obstruct the Framework Agreement. The latest events in the Tetovo area, the death of the kidnapping of Macedonian civilians are proof that violence continues. We should all condemn these obstacles to peace and stability. Macedonia is determined to pursue the path of peace and will not allow these events to blur our vision and detract us from our main goals of building a strong democracy at home and becoming integrated into Euro- Atlantic structures. The recent history of crises has shown more than ever the importance of cooperation and solidarity among the countries of our region, and we have acted accordingly. The integration into the European Union and NATO is a common goal of all the countries in the region of South-Eastern Europe. We are all aware that membership is a solution to lasting stability and prosperity. We the strengthening of international peace and security, to enhancing international cooperation in all areas and to strengthening the role of the United Nations. This year, the Republic of Macedonia submitted, and the First Committee adopted without a vote, a draft resolution on the maintenance of international security (cid:151) good- neighbourliness, stability and development in South- Eastern Europe. That resolution was co-sponsored by 46 Member States. are determined contribute to to The struggle against terrorism must not deter us from taking up other important parts of the United Nations agenda. At last year(cid:146)s Millennium Summit we the direction of future United Nations identified activities to which we committed ourselves: the eradication of poverty, the struggle against AIDS, conflict prevention the environment. On this occasion, however, let me refer to the matter of the rights and well-being of children, and in that context to reiterate the importance of the upcoming special session on children as a forum to the protection of and 39 review the progress achieved and the further steps that need to be taken for the benefit of children all over the world. it is crucial for to be addressed immediately. the Furthermore, globalization remains one of the most important issues on the international agenda. It is obvious that there are some essential problems that need the new In millennium, international community to address the development agenda in a more appropriate way. We believe that the United Nations has a major role to play in this process. Next year(cid:146)s International Conference on Financing for Development and the World Summit on Sustainable Development are the most important events in this respect, and we should all contribute as best we can to their successful outcome. Another important issue is the trade negotiations under World Trade Organization patronage, with special emphasis on the problems of marginalization, and implementation of all multilateral environmental agreements. the new comprehensive launching of development sustainable to After 11 September, the world changed. We have to adjust the new realities. There are many challenges ahead of us, and the United Nations has to be better prepared to deal with them. That will require even greater commitment on our part. The strength and the success of our Organization depend on the resolve of all its Members to respond to the new realities in a more efficient, relevant and adroit manner. We all have our part to play in this respect. This is the best contribution we can make to building a better world for all of us. Last, but not least, allow me also to extend my sincere congratulations to the United Nations and to its Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, on the Nobel Peace Prize award. This is yet another proof of the lasting the principles and values of our relevance of the United Nations Organization as enshrined Charter and of its Secretary-General. the outstanding leadership of in "}}
