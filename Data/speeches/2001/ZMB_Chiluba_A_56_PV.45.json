{"speech":{"0":" Let me by congratulating you, Mr. President, on your election as President of this fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. My delegation pledges its support and cooperation to you and your country as you discharge your important responsibilities. begin I also wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, President of the fifty-fifth session. We are grateful to him for the able and successful manner in which he presided over the session. I wish to salute the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his re-election to the helm of the United Nations, which is an attestation of the commitment and 14 the dynamism with which he has guided Organization during this period of great challenge. the I am addressing this session in my dual capacity as President of the Republic of Zambia and current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). This occasion holds a special significance to me as I make my last statement to the General Assembly as President of the Republic of Zambia, having almost come to the end of my second and last tenure of office of my country. This year the general debate of the General Assembly is taking place in November instead of two months ago, because of the tragic events of 11 September. Those developments united us on the need to postpone this session, just as we were united in our resolve to fight international terrorism, which knows no boundaries. Indeed, today more than ever before, the entire world seems more conscious of, and gripped by, terrorism and the consequent loss of life and destruction of property. the evil of international Terrorism is an affront to humanity. It is a heinous and cowardly act that is hated almost as much as we hated apartheid or any form of racism. It is for these reasons that Africa has for a long time been fighting international terrorism. In Algiers, Algeria, in 1999, we, as African leaders, took a mammoth decision by adopting a Convention on the prevention and combating of all forms of terrorism. Although the Convention has not entered into force, Africa has since then been seeking international support in the adoption of appropriate strategies for the effective eradication of the multiple root causes of terrorism. We remain resolute and resolutely committed to, and united in, the pursuit of this goal. However, let me also hasten to add that, in spite of its gravity and magnitude, the threat of terrorism must not override or deduct from the appropriate focus on the outstanding matters on the global agenda. Burning issues such as the scourge of conflicts, poverty eradication, the debt problem and the HIAIDS pandemic, among other things, should continue to be accorded the necessary attention they so much deserve. positive developments have been taking place on the African continent, largely overshadowed by the many conflicts that continue to rage in a number of our countries. We have witnessed conflict in the Mano River basin involving Sierra While many nevertheless, things good and these are, Leone, Liberia and Guinea; the situations in Sudan and Somalia are yet to be settled; disturbances recently erupted in the Comoros; and violence continues to threaten the constitutionally elected Government in the Central African Republic. The Great Lakes region remains a tinderbox, while the conflict in Angola has experienced no movement towards resolution for quite some time now. Meanwhile, the ceasefire agreement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is yet to be fully implemented. Africa does not lack the political will or resolve to find solutions to these conflicts. Neither has Africa sat back and waited for the outside world to come and resolve has acknowledged responsibility for these conflicts and has spearheaded efforts to bring peace wherever there have been conflicts. Instead, Africa conflicts. these It was Africa, through the efforts of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, that brought about an end to the Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict. The guns were silenced in Liberia and Sierra Leone, thanks to the efforts of the leaders of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), who are still leading the effort to bring peace to the Mano River basin. The leaders of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) have continued to seek peaceful settlements in Sudan and Somalia, while the Lusaka peace processes have addressed the conflicts in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Most recently, a Transitional Government of National Unity was inaugurated in Burundi on 1 November 2001, as a culmination of efforts started by the late Mwalimu Julius Nyerere and completed by Nelson Mandela, two of Africas most distinguished sons. It is clear from the foregoing that what Africa needs to successfully resolve the conflicts on the continent is the moral, practical and financial support of the international community. Africa has always believed in the dictum that in unity there is strength. We believe that all nations belong to a common global community with a shared responsibilities. shared destiny and To this end, Africa has always been ready and willing to participate in efforts to restore peace where peace has broken down, irrespective of the location of the region. Our men and women have served as peacekeepers in Europe, in Asia and in the Middle East because we believe that peace is indivisible. Africa therefore expects that, just as we are ready and willing to serve in the promotion and defence of peace everywhere, so, too, should the international community be willing to be full partners in the search for peace in Africa. the to organize In this regard, I cannot help but register our disappointment that after the painstaking efforts by Sir Ketumile Masire inter-Congolese national dialogue in Addis Ababa on 15 October 2001, and notwithstanding the many pledges made to finance it, the dialogue could not take off due partly to insufficient funds. I would therefore like to appeal to the international community, through the Assembly, to provide the necessary assistance to Sir Ketumile Masire, the facilitator of the inter-Congolese dialogue, to enable him to proceed with organizing the dialogue and to conclude the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In particular, I wish to make a special appeal to all those who have made pledges to the facilitator to release these pledges urgently. Conflicts do not stand alone or develop in a vacuum. Political conflicts and social tension are a result of imbalances in the dispensation of political power, economic wealth and benefits, as well as of social suppression, segregation and the repression of one or more groups of people on the basis of race, ethnicity or even religion. The African continent, with barely 40 years of independence, has suffered centuries of fractured development, deprivation of resources and the political and social suppression of its people. These are the conditions at the centre of Africas current struggle to redress both the political and economic imbalances. The United Nations World Conference against Racism, held in South Africa this year, took a major historical step by refocusing on that human injustice of the past, whose consequences continue to ravage our societies to this day. The Conference condemned the slave trade, slavery, colonialism and apartheid as crimes against humanity. The condemnation of past injustices should be made on the premise that we now have the will, the resolve and the commitment to embark upon the process of healing, reconciliation and redress. Our final objective is to bring about justice, political liberation, economic development and a fair social system that will promote the human rights of individuals, the national sovereignty of States and mutually global interdependence and cooperation. beneficial regional and 15 The African economic and social condition has been on the agenda of the United Nations since Africas decade of independence. Slavery, colonialism and apartheid, and now pervasive poverty, misery and squalor for the majority of our people continue to ravage the continent with negative consequences for human life. The advent of HIAIDS, coupled with centuries-old diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis and with many other communicable yet curable diseases such as cholera, dysentery and diarrhoea, has reduced African life expectancy from 68 years to 50 years, and in some countries to only a pathetic 38 years. The mortality rate for children under the age of 5 years is 140 per 1,000 births on the average. Such adverse social conditions cannot be at all conducive to economic development and the standard of living. These conditions have to be changed for the better. improvement in The development process of post-colonial or independent Africa has also accumulated debt and suffered negative terms of trade for its raw materials and products exported to the developed countries. On the one hand, the resulting huge trade deficits of African nations reduce their purchasing power for the technology, equipment and investment capital they need for economic growth and development. On the other hand, the deficit increases the foreign debt and shrinks for infrastructure and education and health delivery the very systems, conditions necessary the eradication of poverty. for development and programmes suppressing investment public thereby further Africa is not asking for charity! No. What Africa is asking for is more accessible conditions for its raw materials and products, and for prices that are fair and conducive to development. We are not asking for charity. No. We are asking for more African countries to have access to the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), so that they could use the freed resources to build infrastructure such as schools, combat diseases, provide safe drinking water and invest income-generating community activities because, eventually, these are the measures which will reduce poverty. We further call on the international community to intensify and accelerate initiatives that should bring debt cancellation to the poor countries. There cannot be a credible solution to the problem of poverty in Africa without debt cancellation. in 16 The continent of Africa has accepted and fully shares the responsibilities that come with globalization. As a developing continent, we need to continue to reorganize ourselves to face the challenges of the time. The thirty-seventh session of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Assembly of Heads of State and Government, held in Lusaka, Zambia, last July, took Africa to a new historical stage when it launched the African Union (AU). The AU will elevate Africas integration agenda by forging a more cohesive political union, while also creating an economic community of nations. The Union also seeks to promote new levels of partnerships with community, particularly in the areas of sustainable economic growth and development and of peace and security. At the Lusaka Summit, the OAU also adopted a new economic-centred recovery programme and poverty reduction strategy called the New African Initiative, which is now called the New Partnership for African Development. international the I wish to take this opportunity to express Africas appreciation to the Group of 8 which, at its meeting in Genoa, Italy, in July, endorsed the African initiative. I also wish to thank the European Union, which, during our meeting last month in Brussels, pledged its full support of the initiative. It is important to note also that Africa has been an active participant in global trade liberalization initiatives. We thank the Government of the United States for the practical step it has taken through the African Growth and Opportunity Act. It is a pioneering example in expanding trade and export opportunities for Africa and for development. debt Debt relief, cancellation, increased production, accessibility to export markets, better terms of trade and economic integration — these mark the way forward to African development, sustainable growth and poverty reduction. Under economic growth and improved social conditions, democracy and good governance will be sustained and conflicts reduced and managed, while peace and security will last. The time has come for me to thank the people of Zambia for having given me the privilege and honour of serving in the distinguished capacity of President of the Republic of Zambia, to thank my colleagues in Africa for entrusting me with the chairmanship of the OAU and for their confidence and support and to thank all of you in the international community. I have tried my best during my tenure of office and can therefore only hope that I have lived and performed up to your expectations. Soon Zambia will have a new president. It is my hope that he will be accorded the same support and cooperation you have so kindly given to me in the last ten years. "}}
