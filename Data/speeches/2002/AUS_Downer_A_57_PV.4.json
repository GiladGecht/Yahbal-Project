{"speech":{"0":" Let me begin by congratulating you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. I am also pleased to welcome Switzerland as a new Member of the United Nations. 23 Let me acknowledge also two other significant developments: the establishment of the African Union, and the creation of the New Partnership for Africa(cid:146)s Development. Both raise real hope for a new era of political stability and economic growth for Africa. We meet at this General Assembly in the shadow of the terrorist attacks on this great city one year ago. Those chilling events were an attack on the values of the great civilizations represented here today, values that are central to the United Nations Charter and this Organization. We can take some comfort in knowing that the international community has responded, deliberately and resolutely, to international terrorism. The coalition in the war against terrorism (cid:151) led by the United States and joined by others, including Australia (cid:151) has accomplished a great deal. The Al Qaeda network in Afghanistan has been disabled. The Taliban regime has been defeated. Now the world is a safer and more humane place. But terrorism cannot be stamped out by military effort alone. Together we must choke off support (cid:151) financial and otherwise (cid:151) for terrorism. We must stop the patrons and bankrollers of the trade in terror, and together face threat. The decisive response of the United Nations after 11 September, embodied in Security Council resolution 1373 (2001), created a framework for Member States to join forces in suppressing, prosecuting and punishing terrorist acts and terrorist financing. insidious this in implement strengthened resolution 1373 All Member States must the (2001). commitments made Australia has counter-terrorism legislative and law enforcement framework. We are party to 10 of the 12 anti-terrorism instruments and will ratify another later this month. Australia is also assisting other countries in the Asia-Pacific region to implement their obligations. its We face another grave threat to international peace and security, one that tests the very authority of the United Nations. For over a decade, Iraq has flouted legally binding obligations to disclose and eradicate its programmes for weapons of mass destruction. Iraq has defied United Nations resolutions, United Nations inspections and United Nations sanctions, and it has ignored some 23 of the 27 United Nations obligations imposed on it under 16 Security Council resolutions. The Secretary-General has been patient, flexible and 24 assiduous in his efforts to get Iraq to comply with Council resolutions. But Iraq has refused to work with the United Nations its programmes for weapons of mass destruction. to dismantle in efforts Until this occurs, Iraq is a grave threat to its neighbours and to the world. Iraq(cid:146)s well documented aggression towards its neighbours and its past use of chemical weapons underline the potency of the threat it poses. Grave concerns remain about Iraq(cid:146)s present capabilities. Up until 1998 United Nations weapons inspectors did much good work in finding and destroying Iraq(cid:146)s weapons of mass destruction program. But the work of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) was never finished, because in 1998 the inspectors were effectively thrown out of Iraq. Four years later, there is little doubt that Iraq has been working hard to rebuild biological weapons programmes. Moreover, serious questions also remain about Iraq(cid:146)s nuclear weapons programme. chemical and its give immediate, unconditional This state of affairs cannot be left unresolved. Iraq must and unrestricted access to inspectors to all areas, facilities, equipment, records and Iraqi officials. In short, Iraq must fulfil the requirements of all relevant Security Council resolutions. If Iraq has nothing to hide, then it has nothing to fear. Indeed, by meeting these demands, Iraq and its people have everything to gain. Let us also be very clear: Iraq(cid:146)s flagrant and persistent defiance is a direct challenge to the United Nations, to the authority of the Security Council, to international law, and to the will of the international community. We cannot stand by and allow ourselves to be ignored. Nor must protracted negotiations be allowed to weaken and eventually paralyse efforts to allay fears about Iraq(cid:146)s weapons of mass destruction. We all must demonstrate a clear, collective determination to uphold the authority of the Security Council, and to ensure that its resolutions on Iraq are in full. Otherwise, if Iraq(cid:146)s pursuit of these abhorrent weapons is allowed to continue, we may shortly be asking ourselves why we failed to act. implemented The terrorist threat has given new urgency to our disarmament and non-proliferation goals, and puts demands on us for a renewed effort to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction (cid:151) both to non-state and state actors. We have to be alive to the willingness of terrorist groups to develop and use chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. Australia, for its part, intends to pursue practical international non- and effective measures through proliferation export-control arrangements. These regimes and arrangements have delivered tangible security benefits, and should be supported strongly. regimes treaty and We also need to deal with other transnational challenges: not just terrorism but other transnational crimes, including the smuggling of arms, drugs and people. Transnational crimes threaten all countries. They require us to cooperate further in law enforcement, intelligence and financial controls (cid:151) much like the war on terrorism. truly trafficking in persons transnational problem. This People-smuggling and trafficking, in particular, lucrative are a the international criminal enterprise undermines refugee protection legal migration system, and programs, that have enabled millions to build new and prosperous lives in countries like Australia. Combating people-smuggling and is particularly important to Australia and to the Asia- Pacific region. This year, Australia co-hosted a regional ministerial Indonesia. Ministers committed themselves to stopping the people who deal cold- heartedly in human cargo. We agreed that, in the first instance, people-smuggling must be legislated against as a serious crime. There is much more we need to do, and Australia welcomes international discussion and action on the United Nations system itself. conference with countries issue, including within thirty-eight from the the addition Australia welcomes the International Criminal Court to the international legal framework. It is an example of positive international cooperation which will complement the efforts of States to end impunity for the worst violations of international humanitarian law. of United Nations work in East Timor is another outstanding example of how the organization can, and does, make a difference (cid:151) in this case in response to a humanitarian crisis. In May we celebrated East Timor(cid:146)s independence. We are now about to welcome East Timor as a new member of the United Nations. That we have arrived at this point owes much to the resolve and courage of the East Timorese. It owes much also to the United Nations and United Nations authorized missions that brought stability and order and renewed hope for the future. I congratulate the Secretary-General and the Security Council for providing the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) with the necessary support, not just for peacekeeping and policing, but also for developing stable governance in East Timor. Sustained United Nations and international support will be critical in East Timor(cid:146)s formative years. Australia is determined to provide such support. I would like to pay tribute to Sergio Vieira de Mello(cid:146)s efforts in East Timor, and to congratulate him warmly on his as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. appointment to Member States home to marshal national and HIAIDS is a global issue that tears at the fabric of our society, and threatens the economic development of entire continents. The United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIAIDS in June last their year brought responsibilities regional responses to HIAIDS. Australia hosted a regional ministerial meeting in Melbourne in October 2001. Ministers agreed on the need to develop strategies to fight HIAIDS, and on the need to share lessons and cooperate in priority areas. We helped establish the Asia-Pacific Leadership Forum on HIAIDS and Development to engender greater cooperation in the region, and we applaud the appointment of a United Nations regional envoy for HIAIDS. the Monterrey The United Nations has a heavy agenda. But it cannot (cid:151) and should not (cid:151) try to do everything. To make a difference it must be selective and focused, matching its activities to its capabilities and to the priorities that we, the Member States, set for it. The agreed Millennium Declaration gave us priorities. And for Johannesburg Development Conference Summit on Sustainable Development have built on these, giving us a framework to shape and direct our work. We also need to revitalize and reform the way in which the key organs of the Organization (cid:151) the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council, the Security Council (cid:151) function. The Security Council, in particular, should be reformed, including by expanding its membership. clear, Financing and the 25 We also need to think again about the relationship between these organs and the Secretariat: time is not a free good, nor are meeting services, nor are the Secretary-General(cid:146)s reports, and nor is the capacity or will of Member States to provide resources without limits. We need to look at how we can more effectively use existing Unite Nations mechanisms (cid:151) particularly the General Assembly and the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) (cid:151) as bodies of review. And we are especially concerned that major United Nations conferences have become so large and unwieldy that their fundamental purposes have been obscured. Australia strongly supports the process of reform proposed by the Secretary-General for his second term. This provides a unique opportunity to address these questions and to (cid:147)re-tool(cid:148) the Organization so as to build on its strengths. As Member States, we are the United Nations. The Organization is there to serve our collective interests. In order to address new threats and challenges, the United Nations must be focused and responsive, and its key organs must function efficiently and effectively. We must continue to work together to enable it to meet our expectations. I am confident that (cid:151) together (cid:151) we can achieve success. "}}
