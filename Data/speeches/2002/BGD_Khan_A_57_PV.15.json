{"speech":{"0":" May I begin by extending my warm congratulations to the President upon his election. We have every confidence that his stewardship of our proceedings will yield fruitful results. Credit is due also to his predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, for his deft handling of our affairs. We also congratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the leadership he has shown during the past year across a very broad range of subjects. His inaugural remarks, which have set the tone for our deliberations, are truly praiseworthy. We welcome two new Members this 4 year, Switzerland and, soon, East Timor. We look forward to working closely with them. As we are all painfully aware, this has been a very difficult year. The day of 11 September 2001 witnessed a dastardly act of barbaric terrorism. It also united peace-loving peoples all over the world as never before. As we continue our struggle to prevent the resurgence of such atrocities, we must also address ourselves seriously to the task of rooting out the causes that spawn such behaviour. Any action in that respect should be based on the widest possible international consensus-building through consultations. Bangladesh has been and shall always be a committed and active partner in the coalition against terrorism. We have taken every necessary step to share information and assist in the curbing of terror. We have sought to implement Security Council resolution 1373 (2001), which we ourselves helped to draft and adopt last year as a member of the Council. At the regional level, we are currently examining ways and means of further strengthening the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism. Terror totally unconnected to any faith or region. It is a global phenomenon that needs to be tackled by means that are both legitimate and consensual. is gender aimed include cooperation peace-building, Those methods equality, measures the promotion of democracy and democratic values, respect for human rights and the rule of law, the peaceful resolution of conflicts, towards equitable economic development, the eradication of poverty, at confidence-building, mutual respect among races and peoples, and harmony — not clashes — between cultures. Those are the main pillars on which we must build a world where hope will reign in place of despair. In the construction of this edifice, the architect must be the United Nations — which, with its Charter principles and purposes — is the greatest institution crafted by humankind. Bangladesh is relentless in the pursuit of those goals, both nationally and internationally. Our problems, as all are aware, are many and varied. Of roughly the size of the state of Wisconsin in the United States, we have a population of 130 million people, which makes us one of the largest nations in the world. left us with Centuries of colonial exploitation inadequate and infrastructure resources, and constrained us in the trap of poverty. Subject to the vagaries of nature, our economy was a gamble in monsoons. Soon after our independence, in 1971, we were perceived as an irredeemable basket case. Since then, we have come a long way. We have dedicated ourselves wholeheartedly to improving the quality of life of our people and to their development. Our policies were grounded in certain values dear to our hearts. We have acted in the firm belief that development is possible only against a matrix of democracy, human rights and the rule of law; that structures and institutions in society must be inclusive, participatory and accountable; and that growth must be pro-poor, pro-environment, pro-equity and pro-women. In our view, tolerance among religions and an appreciation of differing opinions must be imbedded in the social psyche. Our rich intellectual heritage and cultural tradition have been the source of home-grown innovative ideas such as micro-credit and special educational projects that have enabled us to initiate the quiet revolution in our society that has led to a process of huge societal transformation. to cut As a result, we have been able to achieve many successes, which have been widely acclaimed. Despite our being a traditional society, through effective family planning programmes we were able the population growth rate by 50 per cent over the last two decades. In agriculture, we now produce sufficient food grains to feed our entire people. We have invested heavily in human resources development and have provided massive budgetary allocations for primary and secondary education. Schooling up to twelfth grade is free for girl students, and all are awarded stipends. Gender mainstreaming is a major policy thrust. In Bangladesh the empowerment of women receives the highest priority. This is achieved mainly through initiatives such as special provisions for education for girl children, employment of women in the garment industry, and micro-credit schemes that generate self- employment for women. Global recognition of these endeavours was manifest in our recent election to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. Excellent the Government and civil society. Bangladesh hosts some largest and most active non- of governmental organizations. In our development process, we are ourselves in the drivers seat. A mix of appropriate macro-economic policies and effective exists between the worlds cooperation utilization of external assistance has vastly reduced our the dependence on foreign aid. A document at International for Development, held at Monterrey, entitled “Successful development: models for the twenty-first century” says that Conference Financing on in Bangladesh is assistance, when “The lesson that official development applied in conjunction with a countrys efforts to resolve its own development challenges, can yield dramatic results.” Today what we seek is not compassion, largesse or charity, but greater market access for our manufactured products, fairer trade and more investment. We may still have a long way to go, but we believe we are on the right track. to achieve At the international level, we are striving to reinforce mutually beneficial and cooperative relations with all countries. We are seeking, in concert with our development partners, the Millennium Development Goals. The special efforts made, and the successes achieved, in Monterrey, Johannesburg and at the special session on children have given us cause for hope. It is now important for all of us to seriously get down to implementing the promises made and to achieving the targets set. We are happy that our image abroad is one of a responsible, politically stable, moderate, democratic and constructive member of the international community. We have actively engaged our neighbours in the development of cooperation and understanding. As the Assembly will recall, it was President Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh who first conceived of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. Today, our Prime Minister, Begum Khaleda Zia, is also committed to bringing the Asian cooperation dialogue to fruition. As a demonstration of our commitment to global stability and peace, we have voluntarily given up the nuclear option and joined the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We actively in peacekeeping operations, and are participate currently one of largest contributors of peacekeepers in the United Nations. of Nuclear Weapons the concept of and the I should note, however, that there are certain issues that continue to trouble us. In South Asia, our own region, the volatility of the situation between two nuclear-capable is deeply worrisome. countries 5 Bangladesh encourages all concerned in South Asia to exercise utmost restraint and seek solutions to their differences and meaningful engagement. dialogue through After emerging from the most destructive episode in its history, Afghanistan has yet to be given the wherewithal for recovery and reconstruction. The international community must redouble its efforts to secure peace throughout Afghanistan and accelerate the reconstruction and rebuilding of the country. Unless we do so, the long-term security and stability of our region will remain very uncertain. In the Middle East, the continued denial of the right of the Palestinian people to their own State and to freedom greatly concern us. The continued illegal occupation of Palestinian land, the trampling of human rights and the Palestinian people by Israel must end immediately. Serious efforts must be seek a comprehensive solution to the problem — a solution that addresses the Palestinian people. the atrocities perpetrated against legitimate concerns of resumed to the We welcome the announcement made in Baghdad with regard to the return of the weapons inspectors, and we see this as a significant step towards the fulfilment of obligations under Security Council resolutions. that impede development The havoc wrought in Africa by ethnic conflict, disease and famine is very disturbing. The financial turmoil in Latin America is a matter of anxiety for all of us. Commitments to the least developed countries remain largely unfulfilled. The existence of large trade- distorting subsidies is painfully clear. Restrictions on the movement of factors of production, including manpower, remain a major impediment to progress. Lack of consideration of the emotional and human aspects of peoples movement across frontiers remains a great source of pain. The concept of a global fund for poverty alleviation financed through some form of international taxation is also worth considering. These are issues that we, with our limited capacity, can do little to influence — though in our modest way we will do our very best to help. Those who can must do more. cooperate with the international monetary institutions and other agencies, funds and programmes to promote the welfare of our people and those of a comparable milieu. Working within the United Nations, we shall endeavour in every possible way to strengthen its institutions and to support reforms that will render them more and democratic. These are pledges that are enshrined in the vision for the future of the Government of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh under the dynamic leadership of Begum Khaleda Zia. They are commitments that are at the core of the Bangladeshi ethos. representative participatory, "}}
