{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of my country, I congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan and the other members of the Bureau on their election. The President can count on the full cooperation of the delegation of Chile for the success of his stewardship. The Government of Chile takes this opportunity to welcome the accession to membership of the United Nations of the Swiss Confederation and, soon, of Timor-Leste. The presence of Switzerland strengthens its historical association with the founding principles of this Organization. The upcoming presence of Timor- Leste symbolizes the role of the United Nations in the creation of a viable and democratic State. We are proud to have contributed to that mission. One year ago, this city suffered a reprehensible terrorist attack that left an indelible stain on the conscience of mankind. That date, 11 September 2001, marked a turning point in contemporary history. This episode brought us face to face with new dimensions of our human vulnerability, with a that universalized insecurity. The attack perpetrated a few kilometres from this place showed us, with frightful cruelty, that human coexistence urgently requires new approaches and new instruments. fragility It has become necessary for Governments and societies to forge positive responses and to work together In a globalized world, it is imperative that we re-evaluate multilateralism, and Chile would like to renew its commitment in that regard. resolutely confront terrorism. to We believe that, at this period of history, we have to make every effort to bring about a safer world. That challenge should unite societies and cultures. As the Secretary-General pointed out yesterday, the United to Nations alone has legitimacy necessary the to an effective contribute security. Complying with Security Council resolutions is a responsibility is essential to the future of the Organization. incumbent upon everyone, and system of The changes that have taken place in recent years have created new challenges and responsibilities for the world that we must assume, and to which we must respond, as a global society. The risks today are indeed both global and without boundaries. Both States and ordinary men and women in every part of the world now face a new environment of uncertainty. In that context, traditional notions of security (cid:151) which were formulated against the backdrop of threats from State actors (cid:151) have been overtaken. A safer world requires that we build consensus and that we develop new approaches that both take into account the multi- dimensional nature of threats and place people at the centre of their concerns. In such a security scenario it is urgent that we promote a comprehensive focus at the global level to deal with new threats and to build a world free of fear and poverty. The concept of human security has emerged from just that sort of change. We would like people to be at the centre of every multilateral deliberation. That was the priority that Chile put forth a decade ago with its initiative to hold a summit on social development. It is that same concern that has led to our participation in the Human Security Network, of which Chile has been the coordinator this year. Human security is linked to the maintenance of international peace and security, public order and the social environment. Those elements should be promoted through innovative and effective strategies. Chile(cid:146)s candidacy for a seat on the Security Council for the period 2003-2004 (cid:151) which has the support of the Group of Latin American and the Caribbean States, for which we once again express our appreciation (cid:151) seeks to strengthen the multilateral approach to crises that threaten international peace and security, as well as to place human security at the centre of the concerns of that main body of the United Nations. Respect for human rights is a fundamental requirement in the search for a world that is free from fear, more secure and full of hope. Human rights are a source of political and social the and provide contemporary the guidelines for international its actions. As a member of legitimacy system in 33 Commission on Human Rights, our country will participate in initiatives to strengthen the fundamental and unique role of that body. Similarly, democracy too is a universal value, one which is expressed mainly through free elections and change in governance. Strengthening integrity, transparency and good governance. That is the proper way to create a democratic environment in which a society can be better integrated, protected and imbued with meaning. democracy requires In our throughout the world. My country constructively supports and promotes the spread of the values of democracy and democratic thinking region, democracy is a fundamental value. The adoption of the Inter-American Democratic Charter represents a step forward in the continuing effort to further refine and strengthen democracy. In that vein, we welcome the establishment of the Community of Democracies as a concerted attempt to make universal the values inherent in democracy. The cultural dimension, as an expression of a modern vision, must be part of our efforts to build a safer world. Intercultural dialogue and respect for diversity are fundamental elements of civilized relations between nations. We believe that intercultural dialogue to the universal values of human dignity. should contribute strengthening the terrorism within International terrorism is a negation of the values that make possible civilized coexistence, in which there must be room for the diversity of the world. Terrorism is the greatest risk facing the global community in building a safer world. Political commitment is to therefore needed to agree on effective efforts eradicate framework of international law. Intercultural dialogue is essential to develop a global strategy to combat terrorism. The United Nations plays an essential role as the leading organization in the fight against terrorism. The work of the Security Council and of its Counter-Terrorism Committee, established pursuant to Council resolution 1373 (2001), and the development of a general convention on international terrorism are efforts that we support and to contribute. A convention on terrorism has been adopted at the regional level, and we will continue to intensify our cooperation through the Inter-American Committee on Terrorism and the Common Market of the South. to which we will continue 34 the globalization of markets, The risks and threats to global security, which are beyond the effective control of States, highlight the nature of globalization in our world today. Indeed, the characteristics of globalization can be seen in such phenomena as the intensification of social relations and the broadening of cultural exchanges and communications. At the same time, however, risks have also become global and the imbalances resulting from the unequal distribution of wealth have increased, thereby accentuating the trend towards exclusion of communities, countries and regions. the marginalization and requires good governance We believe in the benefits of economic and that political globalization. But we also believe a globalization international systematic and shared effort by community the new international system. We believe that there should be greater participation in this effort, as well as ongoing consultations with our citizens and our civil societies. The United Nation system is an indispensable forum for addressing these challenges. to establish rules of and the the that Just as we believe the process of globalization in which we are now engaged requires clear rules in order for its benefits to reach all of mankind, we also believe that the economic growth and prosperity of countries require freedom, democracy and security in this global world. Chile had adopted a model that assigns to the market and to the private sector a key role in its development plans, within a framework of democracy and solidarity. We are convinced that active participation in international trade is a positive way of achieving growth, increasing employment, being area of technology and being effective in the allocation of resources. innovative the in Based on our commitment to development with equity, we have opened up our economy, our communications and our culture; and we are satisfied at having done so. We believe, based on our experience, that globalization can be a source of opportunity for all nations, particularly for small and remote countries such as ours, which are far from the major consumer centres and international flows. In order for the efforts of nations such as ours to be rewarded, however, it is essential for international trade to be fair, to have clear-cut, established rules, and to avoid measures that distort it. Subsidies and lax of anti-dumping measures implementation are obstacles to the achievement of that goal. In this connection, I wish to place special emphasis on the urgent need for the liberalization of the trade in agricultural products. Many developing countries, including my own, are highly competitive in this sector, but lost because of protectionism in the developed countries. the benefits are We argued forcefully in Doha and Monterrey that in order for there to be growth, there must be access to markets. As President Ricardo Lagos stated in Monterrey, (cid:147)If trade barriers were eliminated, the developing countries would have the potential to earn $130 billion, more than twice the $50 billion that we proposed as a target for the Millennium Summit(cid:148). We urge the United Nations to continue its efforts to promote the integrated activities of the various multilateral political, economic and financial agencies that are helping to achieve a world of greater development, equity and security. As the multilateral system continues to develop culturally, socially and politically, Chile will continue to promote the gender perspective the international system and its subsystems. We also support the creation of opportunities for participation by civil society organizations. the mainstreaming of into activities of the various The more developed, more equitable and safer world to which we aspire also requires us to establish international standards for the protection of the rights of vulnerable groups. Chile will continue to encourage the conclusion of agreements that contribute to the formulation and improvement of public policies in this field. to underscore our political commitment to achieving a comprehensive convention that protects and promotes the rights and dignity of people with disabilities. Integration, recognition of the dignity of people and equality of opportunity for all are the basic precepts of a more secure society. I would like We are convinced that we need to commit ourselves as an international community to more active policies for the protection of the environment. Few issues on the international agenda affect us all equally as much as this one and, paradoxically, few generate as many disputes. The Johannesburg Summit confirmed my belief that we must work towards consensus on basic concepts. to live The right therefore give priority in a socially acceptable environment is an ethical imperative of the present day. We must to a global environmental agenda that focuses on improving legal norms relating to, and providing better protection for, the oceans, the climate, the atmosphere and the ozone layer. Given the direct impact that this issue has on development, I wish to note that, in December 2003, at Concepci(cid:243)n, Chile, the World Biotechnology Forum will take place under the sponsorship of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and the Government of Chile. With regard to the political dimension, which emphasizes security, human rights, democracy and the fight against terrorism, I would like to refer to certain areas of the world that are of greatest concern to the international community. Latin America is a region in which democracy is the norm, even though in some cases it is fragile. The nations of our continent have learned how difficult to build and sustain democratic institutions based on universal principles and values. We have a number of regional and subregional mechanisms that compel us to fulfil this obligation. The Rio Group is without doubt the most important of these. is it The world is aware of the current economic crisis in our region. This is a paradoxical situation. Latin America responded properly to the challenge and adopted many of the structural economic reforms that were asked of it, which led to a degree of liberalization without precedent in its history. The developed world, however, is sending contradictory signals that test the faith of those of us who view globalization and the system of free trade as the basis for the development of our peoples. Those of us who believe that globalization must be based on the principles of competitiveness without exclusion thus see, on a regular basis, restrictions placed on our products; these are very difficult to explain. This casts doubt on the existence of a desire to move towards a globalization without compartmentalization. Because of its gravity, I must refer to a conflict that affects the entire international community. Chile wishes to express its deep concern at the grave situation in the Middle East in the light of the impasse in the peace negotiations aimed at finding a solution to the crisis between Palestinians and Israelis. The 35 continuing escalation of the violence that began in the region on 28 September 2000 continues to claim many victims and to cause heavy material damage, and threatens to spread throughout the region, thereby posing a serious danger to international peace and security. The Government of Chile reiterates the need for the strict implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and recourse to constructive negotiation, with a view just, comprehensive and lasting peace that make possible the creation of a viable Palestinian State and coexistence with the State of Israel within secure and internationally recognized borders. A world in which Palestinians and Israelis can live together will be a more secure world. to achieving a We share the international sense of urgency that the Government of Iraq must abide by the provisions of Security Council resolutions in the interest of regional and global security. We are convinced that in this globalized world it is essential for us to act in accordance with the principles and values promoted by the United Nations. In Africa we now see signs of hope. Chile wishes to express its firm support for the African continent in its decision to create modern regional instruments, such as the African Union and the New Partnership for Africa(cid:146)s Development. We hope that these initiatives, to which Africans themselves have referred to as the African renaissance, will generate in the international community a response commensurate with those efforts. This is a new challenge for the twenty-first century, and the United Nations must be involved. in In solidarity the most Chile, a small nation that looks out at the world from the South, has developed important links of international diverse directions (cid:151) in Latin America as part of the inter- American system; in its association with the European Union; and as a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization. for open multilateralism, we are facing today(cid:146)s challenge of working towards a more secure world (cid:151) a world free from fear and poverty. We will encounter obstacles which we must confront with shared political resolve. This the countries represented here today in the General Assembly. responsibility of all opting the is Let us advance towards global human security. Let us combat terrorism, poverty and misery in the 36 is this convinced challenge, Chile search for a more democratic and more tolerant society. In that multilateralism can and must contribute to overcoming the insecurity currently prevailing in the world. The United Nations offers such an opportunity to the international community. It is a forum that can and must seek consensual solutions to the inescapable problems now plaguing humankind. "}}
