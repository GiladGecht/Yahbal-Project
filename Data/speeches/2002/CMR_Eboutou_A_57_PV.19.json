Current circumstances may not be conducive to optimism, but the peoples of the United Nations are continuing to make progress towards the future. The heads of State or Government of the countries of the world mapped out the contours of that future during the Millennium Summit. They called for a future world in which humankind can live free from all fears and free from want. I am convinced that, given your excellent qualities, Mr. President, you, like your predecessor, will contribute to strengthening cohesion and peace among all States and peoples. Cameroon welcomes the new additions to our family. Switzerland, our friend, has taken up the United Nations banner, and the young Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste will soon be joining it. tribute to like to pay I should also the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who, through his tireless efforts and commitment, is consolidating, day by day, the credibility and vitality of the United Nations in the eyes of its Member States and, more broadly, in international public opinion. The United Nations, as never before, is a place for coordination, research, action and vigilance in favour of international peace and security. Our steadfast and determined commitment against terrorism in the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September 2001 is proof of this. to Cameroon has acceded the conventional instruments adopted by the United Nations immediately after that tragedy. We also associate ourselves fully with the resolutions that are now enabling the gradual emergence of a new Afghanistan â€” one of liberty and modernity for its people. The President took the Chair. Finally, I wish to reaffirm the strong commitment in fellowship and solidarity of the Marshall Islands with all the Member States of this body. Long live the United Nations. God bless the United Nations. The fight against the destructive, indiscriminate and persistent evil of terrorism must be viewed in the long term in each of our countries and be based on decisions agreed to at the international level. That is why Cameroon fully supports the convening of a high- level conference to develop a joint response by the international community to terrorism. "}}
