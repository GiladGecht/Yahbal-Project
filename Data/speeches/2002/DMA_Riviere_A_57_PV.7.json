{"speech":{"0":" The Commonwealth of Dominica joins other delegations in congratulating you on your election to chair the proceedings of the fifty- seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are confident that you will preside over this Assembly with the efficiency and dedication required to take us through the agenda of the fifty- seventh session. We also take this opportunity to extend to your predecessor our sincere appreciation for the excellent manner in which he steered the work of the fifty-sixth session of this General Assembly. One year ago we convened in a city reeling from a terrible tragedy which spurred the international community to unite in the fight against international terrorism. The worlds response to the events of 11 September 2001 was one of total condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and a firm undertaking to uphold the principles of freedom and democracy enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The United Nations Security Council was swift and decisive in its adoption of a resolution focused on suppressing the financing of terrorism and denying terrorists any safe haven in which to operate. Sadly, My Government is making every effort towards the successful implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) in spite of limited human and financial resources. Legislative measures which have been put in place include an Exchange of Information Act, which addresses some of the concerns of international community as expressed in resolution 1373 (2001). This Act was passed in the Dominica Parliament in January 2002, while a bill for the suppression of financing of terrorism will be tabled before Parliament shortly. the My delegation wishes to take this opportunity to express its appreciation for the initiatives taken by the Counter-Terrorism Committee, the Commonwealth, the European Union and other countries and organizations to assist developing countries in their implementation of resolution 1373 (2001). The historic entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) takes us one step further in the fight against impunity of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Commonwealth of Dominicas accession to the Statute of the ICC in January 2001 is indicative of our support for the establishment of a permanent international court that will bring the most serious international crimes to justice. In this regard, the ICC must seek terrorist-related crimes which may be localized in action, but may have severe global consequences. to prevent or penalize the perpetrators of The international situation, notably developments in the world economy, has not been favourable to the growth prospects of small States such as the Commonwealth of Dominica, which remains a small, open and largely agriculture-based economy, extremely vulnerable to external economic shocks. While the events of 11 September 2001 are behind us, the irreparable damage small Caribbean countries is still evident. Hardest hit was the tourism sector, one of the areas with the greatest potential to Dominicas social and economic development. the economies of to to contribute 31 to our contributor The growth of our offshore financial sector, another potential economic diversification, has been adversely affected by our countrys inclusion in the list of non-cooperative countries and territories put out by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)s Financial Action Task Force. All attempts thus far to have our country removed from that list have proved futile, in spite of the implementation of the measures necessary to ensure best industry practices in the financial services sector. The Commonwealth of Dominica nevertheless commits itself to the global combat against money- laundering and stands ready to cooperate with the international community in its anti-money-laundering initiative. A number of new laws have been enacted by Parliament its anti-money-laundering policies. The Commonwealth of Dominica has also established a Financial Intelligence Unit and a Money- Laundering Supervisory Authority to ensure that our financial-services sector remains free from money- laundering. legislate to As I address you, my country is facing one of the most challenging periods in its history. The slowdown in the global economy, the impact of the events of 11 September 2001 on an already deteriorating fiscal situation, the continued difficulties of integrating into the multilateral trading system in a globalized world and in overseas development assistance have undoubtedly affected our economic performance in an appallingly negative way. rapid decline the We have been left with no other option but to pursue a stabilization and adjustment programme, International which, although approved by the Monetary Fund, has not succeeded in keeping detractors, including the public service union, off the streets. for the The success of this programme should lay the sustained higher growth output and basis reduction. We employment, as well as poverty recognize, of implementing this programme. The Dominican people have been asked temporary, but heavy sacrifices in order to place our country on the road to recovery. to make attendant however, costs We wish to recognize, in this forum, the support given in these difficult times to the Commonwealth of Dominica at the Caribbean regional level, and look 32 forward to the timely support of the international community. Last year, as the world turned its attention to the events of 11 September, the Secretary-General reminded us that none of the issues that faced us on 10 September had become less urgent. Indeed, the United Nations calendar for the past year has been crowded with special conferences and summits, all convened to address problems and issues of global concern that affect the everyday lives of the peoples of the United Nations. While it is true that those issues are current and of interest to the smaller members of this body it is unfortunate that many of us do not have the capacity or wherewithal to ensure they receive effective representation, not only at the conferences but, more significantly, that precede the conferences. It is no accident, therefore, that most often the States that least benefit are the smallest and least influential. the preparatory committees that in The Second World Assembly on Ageing and the special session on children attempted to deal with issues which affect the most vulnerable members of our societies. The World Assembly concluded in April with a Plan of Action the international community. In small countries like the Commonwealth of Dominica, implementation must, of necessity, include the recognition of older persons as the pillars of our societies — people who make a significant contribution to our economic development. implementation by this for tenth annual My Government has developed a national policy on ageing which seeks to ensure that older persons are provided with protective care and given an opportunity to continue to participate in the development of our nation. A few weeks ago, we were privileged to host the regional meeting of HelpAge International — a happy coincidence, given that among our population of 75,000, we have 22 centenarians. I want to make specific mention of the worlds oldest living person — a Dominican woman, Mrs. Elizabeth Israel, affectionately known as Ma Pampo — who is allegedly 127. Civil society organizations like HelpAge must be recognized for their vigorous attempts to deal with issues affecting older persons. As a family of nations, we established set goals, strategies and actions in pursuit of a better life for children at the special session of the General Assembly on children. As a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Commonwealth of Dominica remains committed to ensuring that childrens rights are protected and respected. Children are one of our most valuable resources. cooperation” The Monterrey Conference on Financing for Development was convened in March this year, and was hailed as a “turning point in the approach to development international community. It was widely acknowledged at Monterrey that, to be effective, both the donors and the recipients had to share the same goals of sustainable development and the alleviation and eventual eradication of poverty. in order for development assistance the by We applaud the commitment expressed by the major donor Governments to the Monterrey Consensus. What we desire, however, is an equitable distribution of the increased official development assistance funds pledged by the heads of State or Government of the European Union in March 2002. The same can be said of the “new compact for global development” proposed by President George W. Bush on 14 March 2002, by which the United States pledged to increase its core assistance to developing countries by 50 per cent over the next three years. We are still confident that global conferences can work, because it has been proved that they serve as forums where new proposals can be debated and consensus sought on topical issues. At the recently concluded Johannesburg Summit, world Governments agreed to halve by 2015 the number of people lacking clean water and basic sanitation. to The stated their willingness My Government was particularly pleased that at the conclusion of the Johannesburg Summit the richer countries reach an agreement, by January 2005, within the World Trade Organization, for “substantial improvements in market access” for food exports from developing countries. Johannesburg Summit underlined the necessary linkage between environmental protection and natural resources management and the issues of poverty, underdevelopment and social justice. The Summit demonstrated the interdependence of social, environmental and economic factors, which must work in unison if long-term sustainable development is to be achieved. Empirical evidence exists to show that poor and weak national economies impact negatively on the environment, while environmental degradation and the over-utilization of natural resources result in declining economies and impoverished communities. The Government of Dominica remains fully committed to Agenda 21 and the Barbados Programme of Action for Small Island Developing States. We reiterate our unwavering support for the Johannesburg Plan of Action and urge all Member States to make good on successful implementation development conventions. their commitments sustainable the for of all in the the context of The increase in levels of official development assistance, to which I alluded earlier, is essential when viewed implementation of development strategies by small island developing States. It is recognized that the small, open economies of these small States require effective means, including financial resources, to counteract the negative effects of globalization and trade liberalization and to foster sustainable development. The Commonwealth of Dominica is acutely aware of the magnitude of the challenges facing our pursuit of sustainable development. Ours is a country with a history of consistently seeking a national development path guided by sustainable development. An integrated development plan, undertaken with the participation of a diversity of stakeholders and sectors, will shortly be completed and will provide us with a framework within which we can address physical, economic and social vulnerabilities in an integrated manner. At this time, my Government wishes to place on record its appreciation of the continued commitment of the Republic of China on Taiwan to the social, economic and infrastructural development of small, vulnerable economies very much like its own. As the fourteenth largest economy in the world, the Republic of China on Taiwan has demonstrated the benefits of having a global perspective on development. We welcomed the World Trade Organization, in November 2001, to admit the Republic of China on Taiwan as a full member of that organization. We look forward to a similar occasion when the Republic of China on Taiwan will take its place in these halls as a full member of the United Nations family. decision the of The Commonwealth of Dominica joins other delegations in congratulating the African nations for two important developments. First, the transformation of the Organization of African Unity into the African 33 advancing the goals of peace, democracy, prosperity and sustainable development. "}}
