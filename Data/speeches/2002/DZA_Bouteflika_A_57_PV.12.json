{"speech":{"0":" Let me at the outset, on behalf of the Algerian delegation, congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the current session of the General Assembly. This is a tribute to your personal qualities and to your country, with which my own has good relations of friendship and cooperation. I should like also to congratulate Switzerland on its admission to full membership in our Organization. I am sure that that country, so deeply attached to neutrality in international affairs, will offer a valuable contribution to our common quest for world peace, at a time when this peace is so seriously threatened, inter alia by international terrorism. I therefore welcome the Swiss delegation to the Assembly and wish it every success in its work here with us. Our Assembly will also shortly be admitting to full membership in the United Nations the new State of Timor-Leste. We welcome its brand-new independence. The Timorese people have freely chosen, through the exercise of their right to self-determination, to be the masters of their own fate. We congratulate them once again for having stood firm, and we welcome them and wish them a future of progress, prosperity and peace. It has been two years now since the historic Millennium Declaration was adopted. In offering a collective response, in a spirit of solidarity, to the challenges facing the world in the areas of peace, security the international community took a responsible approach to the situation that, given the subsequent events that disrupted and shook the world, make that Declaration seem to have foreshadowed the present. eradication of poverty, and the The tragic events of 11 September 2001, which we commemorated just a few days ago, highlighted the need for a collective response to this global threat of terrorism. For a decade, Algeria has had to face alone this scourge of the modern age. We are glad that there is now greater awareness of this phenomenon within the international community and of the measures that need to be taken to address it.

(E) *0259324* regional African, Arab Algeria participated in the efforts to conclude the conventions to combat terrorism adopted within the various Islamic organizations of which Algeria is a member. Those to conventions made a strengthening framework essential for any action for effective international cooperation in combating terrorism. significant contribution international legal and the We believe that it is a matter of urgency to adopt a comprehensive convention on combating terrorism, which would provide a normative framework for bringing together the various cooperation agreements in the anti-terrorist struggle. We must go beyond our differences in respect of how we define terrorism in seeking one acceptable to all, avoiding ambiguities that we all condemn. More specifically, we reject any association between Islam and terrorist activities. We cannot equate terrorism with the fight by people who are deprived of their rights (cid:151) an unequal fight that they are waging with all the resources and weapons available to them. include Because of the excesses committed by the Israeli occupiers, the international community has defined the conditions necessary to bring back a just and lasting peace in Palestine and in the Middle East. The conditions the resumption of negotiations based on the principle of land for peace, and (cid:151) a cardinal point (cid:151) the confirmation of the right of the Palestinian people to establish a State within recognized and secure borders, and two States (cid:151) Palestinian and Israeli (cid:151) living in peace, side by side. the rejection of violence, its corollary, The Beirut Arab initiative offered the outline for such a settlement, based on international law and the principle of land for peace. That Arab initiative was welcomed by the United Nations and the co-sponsors of the peace process, and it breathed new life into a peace process that had been languishing. Algeria, today as in the past, stands side by side with the Palestinian people in their exemplary struggle for freedom and dignity, which can succeed only when the Palestinian people are recognized, including its right to the establishment of an independent State, with Al- Quds as its capital, and a complete Israeli withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied since 1967. That is legitimate national rights of the 2 the only way to bring peace, stability and security back to the sensitive region of the Middle East. in In that same region, Iraq, positive developments have just occurred which give grounds for hope that the logic of war will finally be replaced by the logic of peace. In agreeing to the return to its territory of United Nations inspectors, Iraq has demonstrated that it is committed to cooperating with the international community so that there can be definitive closure on the question of weapons of mass destruction. That was a courageous decision by the Iraqi Government, which must logically lead to the definitive lifting of sanctions, which have hurt the Iraqi people so badly, and to bringing back peace and security to that country and to the region as a whole, in strict respect of the sovereignty and unity of the Iraqi people and of the territorial integrity of its national territory. to self-determination, pursuant Close by Algeria, in Western Sahara, 27 years after the withdrawal of the former colonial Power, the Sahrawi people are still demanding their inalienable right to General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and to the resolutions that the General Assembly has been adopting and confirming year after year, since it called in 1966 for the decolonization of territory and for self- determination for the people through a referendum. the The international community cannot remain indifferent to the fate of that people, nor can it accept that the full implementation of the Settlement Plan and of the Huston agreements be postponed time and again. Algeria, a neighbour to the two brotherly peoples of Morocco and Western Sahara, will continue to do its utmost in the service of international peace and of stability and unity in the subregion. Algeria has fully supported the efforts made by the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy, and we have made a significant contribution the conflict. The United Nations (cid:151) and the Security Council in particular (cid:151) is dealing with the issue of Western Sahara. Algeria hopes that its relationships with its neighbours will not be jeopardized by this dispute and that the Arab Maghreb Union will be able to resume its activities and develop fruitful cooperation with all the countries in the region. the settlement of to This session is taking place at a time when globalization is accelerating and an information and communication technologies revolution is under way. the this process and Questions continue to arise about the benefits and challenges of risks of marginalization and exclusion that it poses for the developing countries, particularly in Africa. This session is of particular significance because it is taking place in the immediate aftermath of the International Conference on Financing for Development and the World Summit on Sustainable Development, two events that could prove decisive for the future of international cooperation for sustainable, balanced and equitable development. While the process that was launched at Monterrey identified how financing is to be mobilized and financial and technical cooperation for development strengthened, the Johannesburg Summit focused on the priority areas of combating poverty and ensuring sustainable development and international cooperation. The right to development must be the main focus of our concern and efforts to strengthen international cooperation through various innovative partnerships between the North and the South, based on the sharing of responsibilities and benefits. In this connection, I would like to mention the signing this year of the Association Agreement between Algeria and the European Union. That Agreement will provide the foundation for launching a genuine, mutually beneficial partnership. official increasing investment Problems relating to internationalizing foreign flows as much as possible, direct significantly development assistance, managing the debt burden, opening markets to the products of the South and restructuring the international financial institutions to allow for greater participation by developing countries clearly remain our major concerns, and we need to find solutions to them quickly. Given the serious crises that are convulsing the world, the establishment of a more equitable international economic and trade order is becoming increasingly require greater political will on international community. important, and will the part of the The outcome of the most recent World Trade Organization meeting at Doha provided us with an opportunity to set up a more open and transparent multilateral to enable developing countries to increase their share of international trade. trading system I would also like to refer to the bilateral and multilateral initiatives that have been undertaken to assist developing countries, in particular the least developed among them. I hope that such initiatives will be followed up with other specific steps that can give real meaning to international solidarity and to sustained efforts aimed at building a more humanistic world, free from the seeds of instability and violence. The world is changing very quickly, resulting in enormous uncertainty about the future of the human race. We note the tendency, in the light of such dangers, to move towards international solidarity, not only in the area of combating terrorism, but also in fighting poverty and preserving the environment. The importance of the role played by the United Nations in finding solutions to the problems facing all of our peoples is becoming increasingly clear. In a world at risk, irreplaceable, because it symbolizes our common commitment to fight for the survival of humankind. this Organization indeed, is, The achievements of the United Nations are impressive in the areas of promoting peace and security, economic cooperation, social progress, humanitarian activities and the development of international law. The fact that such achievements have been made despite difficulties and inadequate resources is an indication of what the system would be capable of were it fully supported by all Member States. Efforts to streamline United Nations activities, ensure improve coherence the enhancement, greater credibility and effectiveness of the Organization. its actions augur well system-wide in coordination and for I should like to pay tribute to the leadership of the this Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, undertaking, which will require a greater commitment on the part of States as well as the provision of more resources. in Strengthening the credibility and effectiveness of the United Nations will also require structural reform so as to enable it to better reflect the new face of international society and deal with all of the challenges facing humankind. In this new millennium, the world will not be able to manage without the United Nations.
