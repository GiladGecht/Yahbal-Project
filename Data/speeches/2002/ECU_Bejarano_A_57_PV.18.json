{"speech":{"0":" Many of the heads of State that have preceded me at this rostrum have been eloquent in expressing their open condemnation of terrorism, their prescriptions for the eradication of extreme poverty, their vision for a new international order that will ensure peace and security in the world and their reservations about a globalization process that, if poorly understood, will in the end make the gap between rich and poor unbridgeable. We want to stress above all the urgent need to take action and to begin to commit new and greater financial to development. We must strengthen our common bond and work together to try to find solutions to the problems that affect us all. resources We, the poor countries, are asked to practise austerity and fiscal discipline, respect the rules of the This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of speeches delivered in the other languages.

When we try to obtain access to the major markets for our goods, however, the door is slammed shut. We are asked to be competitive, but when we take the fruits of our labour to the market, subsidies amounting to millions of dollars are placed in our way, making it impossible for us to even hope to compete. We are asked to participate in the fight against drug trafficking, but we have not been given the resources promised us to enable us to carry out our action plans. When we try to negotiate in a serious and creative way with international lending agencies, attempts are made to impose terms on us — terms that, if accepted, would dangerously weaken our young and sometimes fragile democracies. People dont understand: our peoples, in their poverty, are quite perceptive, but they still cannot understand how they can benefit from a globalization process that may never knock at their doors. We, the leaders of the developing countries, are severely criticized when, upon our return from summits and forums, we have only meagre results to show, and when the resolve to provide support and cooperation is weakened because of the actions of a few with respect to a consensus declaration. in violence, sectarian extremism I want to be very clear and simple in expressing my thoughts this universal forum: hypocrisy, inequity, injustice, increased poverty and failure to take action, among other ills, are the main reasons for breaches of the peace. They create a framework in which and misunderstanding find fertile ground. The developed world has found new and discriminatory methods — in financial, social and ethical terms — of categorizing our countries. Some are willing this perverse way of categorizing us on the basis of criteria laid down by those that have more than we do. We are criticized for a lack of transparency and for some alleged lack of respect for the law, while enormous losses are piling up owing the very foundations of the capital system have been seriously damaged by the scandals that have taken place in the wealthier and more powerful nations? to corruption. Could to perpetuate it be that 2 freedom. Developed countries demand Our emigrants are discriminated against, and some forget how the most prosperous nations managed to create their identities through the mixing of races or by opening their arms to those yearning for progress and the strengthening of our institutions and they get quite lyrical in their support for democratic processes, which often take forms that lead only to instability. We must break paradigms, and we must do it now. We must not persist in simplifying, relying on a purely economic vocabulary, all the benefits of a globalization process that is still not understood by all, nor assimilated in each of its components. We speak of free flows of capitals, but these flows only take the form of transfers of investments in the Northern Hemisphere. We countries in the Southern Hemisphere have typically received these same capitals in the form of expensive loans, whose heavy burden it has been impossible to alleviate over time. in statements, manuals and When the North looks to the South, it sees it with paternalistic and patronizing eyes. The widely publicized equity in the terms of exchange is only visible textbooks of developed countries. What we need is a new global ethic, one that repudiates terrorism but helps, with the same strength and resolve, give substance to our creative efforts to eradicate poverty, a poverty that threatens the most basic principles of human dignity. When food is lacking, when there is no health or education, and when the survival instinct itself is limited, very little or nothing can be done to pursue values and ideals cherished by any developed society. My country condemns terrorism. My government supports every effort to eradicate it, but Ecuador also demands the creation of a new coalition and a new order to fight against poverty. This is a new century, a century of solidarity and hope. But we must also make this century a century of respect on the part of all nations for the principles that govern international law. Yes, it is a new century, a century in which all activities that violate the sanctity of human life are condemned and prosecuted. There is no justification whatsoever for taking the lives of innocent persons. We must work with all forces available, together under the law, to fight this scourge. This is also a century of changes of attitudes and of proposals, a time in which we must resolve definitively the problem of the debt of the poorest countries towards the developed countries. It must be a time of opportunity to build a fairer world, a world of solidarity. "}}
