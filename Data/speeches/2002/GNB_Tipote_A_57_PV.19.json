{"speech":{"0":" First of all, I would like to thank the outgoing President of the General Assembly, Mr. Han Seung-soo, for the superb manner in which he led the work of the fifty-sixth session of the Assembly. (spoke Permit me, Sir, to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly, and to express my best wishes for success in your work at the head of this important body. It is with enormous satisfaction that, on behalf of the President of the Republic of Guinea- Bissau, Mr. Kumba Yala, we welcome Switzerland as a Member of the United Nations. We also look forward to welcoming the Republic of Timor-Leste, a member of our community of Portuguese-speaking countries. The loss of human lives can never be justified by a cause, no matter what its noble goals. Just a year ago, the people of Guinea-Bissau joined their voices to those of the international community in condemning all acts of terrorism and all actions which would threaten international security. the lofty We are convinced of ideals of democracy, in which human security becomes the pillar of societys development. Therefore, on my own account and on behalf of the people of Guinea-Bissau, I condemn the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, and we reiterate our conviction that the only way in which to combat such infamy is to unite all our efforts under the auspices of the United Nations. Our readiness to cooperate in the quest for solutions that will guarantee peace and stability in our subregion is great, although the internal conflicts in neighbouring countries inevitably entail costs in the defence and security areas. They also compel us to sacrifice the meagre budgets of priority sectors of the Governments programme, such as health and education. rights, cooperation international The progressive establishment of democracy, human and development will restore the dignity of our people. Convinced of this, we are developing partnerships with the United Nations system to combat poverty in Guinea-Bissau. We continue to make sacrifices to pave the way for development. These sacrifices include interruptions in the normal course of development in a State where the 1998 conflict bore witness to the evils of a peoples poverty, and to the destruction of the 15 precarious structures of a new State in a region where there are pockets of conflict that tend to cross borders, and thus to increase the climate of instability. in The Senegalese conflict, the Casamance region, provides an example of our resolve to help find consensus solutions to put an end to many years of armed conflict the neighbouring Republic of Senegal. Respect for the Charter of the Organization of African Unity as it relates to the retention of the borders inherited from colonialism calls for Guinea- Bissaus participation in efforts to establish peace and stability in a united and indivisible Senegal. in Based on this conviction, our country supports the efforts of the Peoples Republic of China towards peaceful reunification, under the theme of “one nation, two systems.” The economic and financial difficulties faced by the Government of Guinea-Bissau have been the object of attention by the members of the Security Council. It is clear that peacekeeping efforts cannot be divorced from the need to preserve economic and social stability in Guinea-Bissau. Thus, progress on peacekeeping, on economic recovery and on development in Guinea- Bissau are interdependent. in involved Guinea-Bissau, a member of the African Union, is the struggle for peace, stability, democracy, the defence of human rights, cooperation, development, prosperity and human dignity. We are bound, furthermore, by our national poverty reduction strategy socio-economic programme to revitalize our continent, following the broader approach of the New Partnership for Africas Development (NEPAD). contribute the to to respect for human It is clear to Guinea-Bissau that the United Nations, as a forum for dealing with questions related to world peace, the eradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development worldwide, and contributing in practical ways to the success of NEPAD and to ensuring that the commitments entered into in Doha, Monterrey and Johannesburg will be effectively implemented. encouraging rights, is I would like to recognize the intelligent, patriotic manner in which Angola put an end to long years of conflict, as well as the progress made towards the resolution of the conflicts in Senegal, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and the Comoros. Dialogue is the best instrument for restoring peace and working towards stability and development for humanity. That is why we encourage the actors in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to join in the effort to find acceptable solutions to bring about concrete security and prosperity for both peoples. Strict compliance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 1397 (2002) will be the only response acceptable to the Assembly and the only proof that the parties recognize the incalculable value of our Organization. in To realize the promises contained the Millennium Declaration and in the United Nations Charter, which would guarantee a more prosperous and just world, we join in the appeal made to the leaders of Iraq to abide by Security Council resolutions with respect to Chapter VII of the Charter, in order to avoid a possible Council decision. Guinea-Bissau shares the need for broader and more effective participation in the work of the Security Council, which is a vital organ of the Organization. Permit me to recall that reducing poverty in the poorest countries, such as ours, will guarantee the prosperity, stability, peace and security of the entire world and is the best way to neutralize terrorism. in We speak out the struggle against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and for the creation of conditions which will allow access to basic resources such as water, to education and to the protein necessary for healthy growth. Solidarity among peoples is and will continue to be the guarantee that we will be able to bequeath to future generations the legacy of a prosperous world. "}}
