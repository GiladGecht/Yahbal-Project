{"speech":{"0":" The tragic events of 11 September 2001 awakened the international community to the gravity of a new menace to world peace and security. The lighting of the eternal flame during the commemorative service in Battery Park was mirrored by the outpouring of sympathy from around the globe and the world became one again, reaching out to those who lost their loved ones on that fateful day. The global community responded promptly and decisively to the scourge of terrorism. Over the past year, international cooperation has been strengthened in our relentless campaign against terrorism. The Security Council, a commendable role in this process through its Counter- Terrorism Committee. The Republic of Korea has been an active member of the international coalition against terrorism. We are now working with other countries to contribute to the rehabilitation of Afghanistan. in particular, has played resolute As we conduct our fight against terrorism, we should also consider that deprivation, lack of good governance and marginalization from the process of globalization can serve as a breeding ground for fanatics who can go so far as to take their own lives just to harm others. The international community should, therefore, take a holistic approach, while bearing in mind at all times that terrorism cannot be justified by any cause or under any circumstances whatsoever. The events of 11 September have also brought home to the world the appalling dangers of weapons of the wrong hands. mass destruction Moreover, reality underscores the urgent need to make progress in disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. falling prevailing international into the It is essential that we achieve universality of non- proliferation regimes (cid:151) including the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention (cid:151) while ensuring full compliance by all 17 States parties to such regimes. We also hope that a total ban on nuclear testing and fissile material production will be achieved through the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and an expeditious conclusion of a fissile material cut-off treaty. In that regard, I would like to underline the Republic of Korea(cid:146)s full commitment to strengthening multilateral collaboration to promote the cause of disarmament and non-proliferation. Since its inception, the United Nations has played a key role in securing peace and stability in the troubled corners of the world. Indeed, the work of the United Nations in conflict prevention, peacemaking, peacekeeping and peace-building has expanded in recent years. to has intends operations peacekeeping East Timor is the latest success for which the United Nations deserves praise. As a Member State committed to the coalition of the willing, the Republic of Korea has actively taken part in the United Nations efforts in East Timor and other parts of the world. Moreover, our overall financial contribution to United Nations grown approximately tenfold over the past three years. The Republic of Korea its involvement in these crucial United Nations activities. The Korean peninsula is still one of the world(cid:146)s most volatile areas. Nevertheless, President Kim Dae- jung(cid:146)s unwavering pursuit of his engagement policy is fundamentally reshaping inter-Korean relations. That engagement policy is, in essence, a strategy for peace through engagement, designed the multiple challenges inherent in inter-Korean relations on the road to eventual unification. As such, it aims at fostering reconciliation, promoting cooperation and exchanges, reducing tension and building durable peace on the peninsula. to cope with inter-Korean strengthen The highlight of the engagement policy was the holding of the historic summit between South Korea and North Korea in June 2000. The summit set in motion an inter-Korean peace process. After ups and downs along the way, the peace process is finally back on track and moving forward again. Inter-Korean meetings at various levels have resumed, as have exchanges in all areas. In fact, on this very day, at Mount Kumgang, the fifth round of reunions between separated family members is taking place. Next week, South Korea and North Korea will hold the long- anticipated ground-breaking ceremonies marking the 18 literally those projects start of construction work for the reconnecting of railways and roads that have remained severed for five decades. Since involve a breakthrough in the heavily fortified border and require a certain level of military-to-military cooperation, they will hold not only great practical benefit but also tremendous symbolic significance. As we look ahead to the completion of the trans-Korean railway, this clearly promises interregional implications for accomplishing the vision of an iron silk road, a rail link joining Asia and Europe. far-reaching have to report The overall progress to date amply demonstrates that the engagement policy works. The Korean people on both sides of the peninsula today enjoy a stronger peace than ever, and the risk of war is at an all-time low since the end of the Korean War, in 1950. However, it is not yet time to be complacent, as we have still a long way to go if the peace process is to prove irreversible and fully sustainable. to One important challenge to the peace process relates the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We continue to believe that the 1994 Geneva Agreed Framework holds the best hope for removing concerns over nuclear proliferation from the Korean peninsula. However, at the moment, the Agreed Framework has reached a critical juncture. As the light water reactor project progresses, it is now essential that full cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency begin without the implementation of the safeguards requirements of the Agreed Framework. further delay for International Conference The path to world peace runs through more equitable economic and social development. In that regard, we attach great importance to the United Nations Agenda for Development and, in particular, to the implementation of the United Nations Millennium Declaration. The on Financing for Development, held in Monterrey in March of this year, was a success in the area of enhancing primary responsibility of developing countries themselves, as well as in emphasizing the need for more substantial input countries. The Political Declaration and Plan of Implementation adopted at the recent World Summit on Sustainable Development are also of great significance, as they have set out a time- bound plan of action for humanity(cid:146)s quest to preserve the planet for posterity. The unprecedented advances in information and communication technologies are also from developed awareness shared the of widening the gap between the front runners and those who lag behind. We hope that the United Nations and other relevant international organizations will become more proactive in bridging the digital divide between developed and developing nations. in any given country The last century witnessed the steady advance and triumph of democracy and human rights as universal values around the globe. As it has been so eloquently put, liberty, when it begins to take root, is a indeed. The human rights plant of rapid growth situation longer an exclusively domestic affair. The issue of human rights has become a priority agenda item for the international community. During the last session of the General Assembly, special attention was paid to the human rights of such vulnerable groups as children and the elderly. We sincerely hope that the pledges made at the Second World Assembly on Ageing, as well as at the special session on children, will be translated into concrete action. is no for The Republic of Korea has a firm commitment to international cooperation the promotion of democracy and human rights. We plan to host the second Ministerial Conference of the Community of Democracies in Seoul in November of this year. We are working with other Convening Group countries to ensure that this proves a momentous occasion in the protection, of democracy the world over. We also welcome the renewed commitment of the international community to combat such growing problems of horrific transnational crime as the trafficking in persons. consolidation advancement and Over the past half century, the United Nations has made outstanding contributions to causes of great importance to humankind. However, the world body cannot possibly meet all expectations. Given the limited means and resources available to it, the United Nations should focus on areas in which it can excel, making the best use of its comprehensive mandate and the universality of its membership. In that regard, the Republic of Korea strongly supports the ongoing reforms that Secretary-General Kofi Annan has been pursuing with a view to achieving a more effective and efficient United Nations. In closing, I would like to say that the United Nations is the embodiment of globalism and the epitome of multilateral cooperation. As such, the international community looks to the United Nations for guidance and effective action in the whole spectrum of areas under its mandate. The Republic of Korea firm commitment to working in concert with other Member States to make the United Nations more relevant and efficient, and thus better able to meet the challenges ahead (cid:151) global challenges indeed. reaffirms its "}}
