{"speech":{"0":" I bring to the Assembly warm greetings from President Kessai H. Note. On behalf of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, I am honoured to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on his election to this high office. Let me also take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-General for the hard work that he and the Secretariat have undertaken in preparation for this General Assembly. I am also very pleased to extend a warm welcome and congratulations from the Marshall Islands to the people of Switzerland and of East Timor, as the newest Members of the United Nations. It is unfortunate that this, the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly, is meeting in the shadow of the anniversary of the terrorist attacks that shocked our host country — and the world — on 11 September 2001. Modern terrorism is an issue of concern for all peoples, regardless of nationality or religion. It is an issue that no nation can afford to ignore. While sharing in the feelings of terror, horror and sorrow caused by the terrorist attacks in the United States, the people of the Marshall Islands are hopeful that the Member States of the United Nations will continue to join together in working towards global peace and security. I urge this body, which collectively represents the moral force of all Member States, to do everything in its power to eliminate the threat of terrorism. I am pleased to announce that the Marshall Islands has recently completed a process of national priority-setting and of assessing Government policy. We have thoroughly reviewed the state of our nation through the holding of a National Economic and Social Summit, whose findings have formed the basis for our long-term sustainable development plan, entitled “Republic of the Marshall Islands Vision 2018”. This process of review was guided by consultations with all stakeholders and all sectors of our society. Extensive discussions and interviews were carried out in order to ensure that all members of the Marshall the opportunity to contribute to our vision for the future. community would have Islands The Marshall Islands Government has determined that all development policies and objectives will be guided by the vision generated by the Summit, and we are now in the process of implementing the core ideals of this blueprint for sustainable development. to responded In developing our national vision, the Marshall Islands Government has also the international agenda as set by the United Nations. We have ensured that our policies will reflect the all- important priorities of good governance, respect for fundamental human the environment, and conservation of natural resources. We have also taken account of social development objectives and of the need to invest in the areas of health and education. We are confident that, by linking our national priorities to the international agenda, the correct policy decisions will be made. rights, protection of During the 1990s the Marshall Islands went through a period of structural adjustment and reform at the demand of the international donor community. We have faithfully carried out these costly and socially disruptive reforms, in the hope that some form of reward would be forthcoming. We now have in place a forward-looking and pragmatic set of policies, and we are eager the betterment of the lives of our people. Yet there are few who are willing to assist us in achieving this goal. into action for translate to them I therefore stand here, at the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly, to advocate for a new international paradigm: one that recognizes both the unique challenges facing small island developing States such as the Marshall Islands, as well as the unique resources and gifts that such nations possess — resources that can benefit the whole of the international community only through substantive and sustained partnerships. It is time to reconceptualize the relationship that exists between more established and less-established nations, from one of donors and recipients to one of mutual beneficiaries and collaborators. Only in this way will it be possible fully to realize the promise of true international cooperation and development. intellectual, environmental The Marshall Islands has so much in the way of native cultural resources to share with the international community. We look forward to creating new forms of partnership with entities around the world — partnerships that will redound to the benefit of the global community and of all its residents. and 29 The partnerships that are most meaningful to us are ones of a practical nature. Our communities, and those of many other nations like the Marshall Islands, are seeking partnerships of action that offer pragmatic and practical solutions that are coordinated and targeted for maximum effect. fragile environment The Marshall Islands shares challenges that are uniquely peculiar to many small island States: a precariously is highly sensitive to the threat posed by global warming; a narrow economic base that imposes constraints on the potential for progressive and sustainable development; and an institutional milieu that is slowly developing the capability of harnessing the benefits of science and technology. that In relation to our international partners, the Marshall Islands is particularly concerned about the following issues. First of all, we are concerned about the environment. The Marshall Islands Government a recognizes and comprehensive approach seeking appropriate solutions to the challenges posed by environmental degradation and pollution. coordinated for in need the We commend the Barbados Programme of Action, which, in conjunction with the outcome forged at the Johannesburg Earth Summit, will provide a guiding framework for sustainable development for small island States, such as the Marshall Islands. The wide divergence of views expressed in Johannesburg posed many challenges, but also produced rich insights into areas where our common strengths lie, and into how these might best be utilized. it the that Further, is vital international community recognize the great challenge to life and culture that is posed by global climate change. This threat to life and culture is felt most acutely by nations such as the Marshall Islands — nations that face the very real threat of complete obliteration if our oceans rise by even marginal levels. On behalf of the Marshall Islands, I commend those States that share our concerns and have signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol. May I also urge the remaining non-signatory States to consider the vital importance and urgency of the international community does not act now, the future will see the disappearance of many small island nations, which immeasurable turn will have issue. this in If 30 economic, consequences for the entire global community. environmental and immigration Secondly, an issue that is particularly relevant to the Marshall Islands is that of nuclear cleanup and non- proliferation. The Marshall Islands seeks partnerships with members of the international community that will help raise to new levels the dialogue about nuclear weapons and their testing. The people of the Marshall Islands have suffered greatly at the hands of a world that is continually preparing for war. We are restrained by the persisting legacy of toxic nuclear waste, which poses challenges far beyond our financial and scientific capability to solve. Our food chain continues to be affected, and our development is thwarted by our inability to use damaged lands. I am pleased to state that the United States Congress is currently reviewing our situation, and we are hopeful that the outcome will contribute towards amelioration of this problem. Nevertheless, we believe that our hard-learned lessons can help to inform and instruct the international community in future debates about the use and testing of nuclear weapons. And thirdly, another issue that is particularly pertinent for our people is that of oceans and fisheries. As a nation whose entire livelihood depends on the resources of the sea, the Marshall Islands Government pledges its unwavering support for the Law of the Sea management regime. In particular, we emphasize the importance of Article 63 (1) of the Convention, which speaks of the need for States to agree on measures necessary to coordinate and ensure the conservation and development of shared stocks. is also pursuing The Marshall Islands the establishment of national fisheries industries that will gradually enable the replacement of foreign fishing fleets; the delineation of our own exclusive economic zone; and the establishment of international guidelines to protect our oceans for generations of future fishermen and the people who count on the work they do for survival. I have mentioned only a few of the priorities that the my delegation will be seeking appropriate moment the upcoming committee debates and in our interactions with United Nations agencies and our development partners. There are, of course, many other issues of concern to both the to raise at in Marshall Islands and the international community as a whole — issues with which all of us will wrestle in the coming years. Among the most important challenges faced by this body is the continued exclusion of the Republic of China on Taiwan from the United Nations. The Marshall Islands Government reiterates its concern that the exclusion of a nation of peaceful and law-abiding citizens is not consistent with the inclusive ideal of the United Nations. I therefore urge each and every one of you, all of us, to overcome our biases and to allow the admission of the Republic of China on Taiwan to the United Nations. Another important challenge faced by this body is the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The Marshall Islands considers that urgent diplomatic action is required in order to work towards a peaceful solution to this threat to international peace and security. The Marshall Islands wishes to emphasize its support for the expansion of the United Nations Security Council. We believe that there should be an increase in the number of both permanent and non- permanent members of the Council and that such expansion from both developed and developing countries. This would significantly broaden the representation base of the Council and thus reinforce its ongoing validity. include members should May I take this opportunity to congratulate the international community on its support for the newly- established International Criminal Court. The Marshall Islands is hopeful and confident that the Court will prove the administration of justice at the international level. We are, however, currently considering the making of a bilateral agreement under Article 98 of the Rome Statute and will determine this issue after a careful assessment of the implications of such an agreement. a powerful mechanism to be in that conferred upon Mr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in French): The delegation of Cameroon welcomes the unanimous vote the Czech Republic the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. Current circumstances may not be conducive to optimism, but the peoples of the United Nations are continuing to make progress towards the future. The heads of State or Government of the countries of the world mapped out the contours of that future during the Millennium Summit. They called for a future world in which humankind can live free from all fears and free from want. I am convinced that, given your excellent qualities, Mr. President, you, like your predecessor, will contribute to strengthening cohesion and peace among all States and peoples. Cameroon welcomes the new additions to our family. Switzerland, our friend, has taken up the United Nations banner, and the young Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste will soon be joining it. tribute to like to pay I should also the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who, through his tireless efforts and commitment, is consolidating, day by day, the credibility and vitality of the United Nations in the eyes of its Member States and, more broadly, in international public opinion. The United Nations, as never before, is a place for coordination, research, action and vigilance in favour of international peace and security. Our steadfast and determined commitment against terrorism in the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September 2001 is proof of this. to Cameroon has acceded the conventional instruments adopted by the United Nations immediately after that tragedy. We also associate ourselves fully with the resolutions that are now enabling the gradual emergence of a new Afghanistan — one of liberty and modernity for its people. The President took the Chair. Finally, I wish to reaffirm the strong commitment in fellowship and solidarity of the Marshall Islands with all the Member States of this body. Long live the United Nations. God bless the United Nations. The fight against the destructive, indiscriminate and persistent evil of terrorism must be viewed in the long term in each of our countries and be based on decisions agreed to at the international level. That is why Cameroon fully supports the convening of a high- level conference to develop a joint response by the international community to terrorism. "}}
