{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Malawi and on my own behalf, I would like to congratulate President Kavan most warmly on his unanimous election as President of the the General that under his able Assembly. fifty-seventh regular session of I am confident 27 leadership, buttressed by a pragmatic approach to the proceedings of the session, we will be able to further consolidate past gains on a variety of issues, and also mobilize renewed international resolve and political will to reinvigorate our continued search for viable the many pressing responses and challenges that survival of humankind. to the very solutions threaten I take this opportunity also to pay special tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo of the Republic of Korea, for the able manner in which he handled the work of the General Assembly during his tenure of office. Further, I would like to register my countrys vote of thanks for and special recognition of the invaluable contribution made by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, in injecting fresh impetus and a sharper sense of purpose and direction into the work of the United Nations. His informative and insightful annual reports on the work of the United Nations clearly point to an organization that is moving in the direction that it should and is much more focused on the quest for accelerated growth and socio-economic progress of the disadvantaged poor nations. A number of developments have taken place around the world since the last general debate. While some of these are relatively positive and are, thus far, a cause for optimism, yet others, a majority, are, at best, disheartening and tend to cast a long shadow on prospects for long term progress, especially in our part of the world. As I speak now, for example, six southern Africa countries, including Malawi, are in the throes of a severe and life-threatening food crisis brought on by drought-related deficits in grain harvests. Up to 13 million people in Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe are facing severe food shortage, which has already given rise to a threat of widespread famine and a rise in famine-related health problems. What we are clearly seeing here is a further deterioration in the general poverty situation and the humanitarian plight of the rural masses in these countries. Chances of the food insecurity translating into a security and health catastrophe cannot be over-emphasized, especially given that southern Africa is already the epicentre of the global implosion caused by HIAIDS. The current food crisis in the sub-region stands out as the severest region-wide serious 28 in many years. It is poised to inflict incalculable damage on the social, economic and cultural fabric of whole communities, and it endangers the efficacy of the financial and economic sustainability of the for institutional and public policy frameworks sustainable under implementation. development currently is Indeed, southern Africa facing uniquely different multifaceted humanitarian crises arising not only from civil wars, but also from social and economic factors and other natural disasters. The crisis is certain to roll back numerous past gains in many sectors, particularly because of the centrality of agricultural production to the gross domestic product and rural employment of most of the affected countries. The food shortage has placed further serious strains on the already low revenue collection capacities of the affected countries, especially to the extent that budgetary allocations are having to be appropriated from critical social sector services to fund massive grain imports necessary to supplement inadequate local grain stocks, thereby financially starving other equally urgent sectoral needs. Sadly, however, the next harvest, due in eight months, may not hold much promise either, unless the drought cycle, which is the major contributing factor, does not recur. Initially, Malawi faced a grain deficit of 600,000 tons caused by two years of a paradoxical combination of drought and devastating torrential rains and floods. This tonnage was urgently required to stave off a rapidly deteriorating famine situation that is expected to affect 3.2 million people. The President, His Excellency Dr. Bakili Muluzi, declared the current food shortages a national disaster on 28 February 2002, and a vigorous national appeal for emergency relief has been under way since then. to The response this appeal by the donor community, both local and international, has been very encouraging. On behalf of the Government of Malawi, I take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude and deep appreciation to the local and international humanitarian organizations and Governments, such as those of the European Union, the Governments of Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and other friendly Governments, which together have financed nearly 75 per cent of the emergency relief supplies received so far in Malawi. We also wish to thank the United Nations funds and programmes for their timely assistance, in particular the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, the World Food Programme and the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), as well as resident United Nations agencies, for providing relief coordination and procurement services during this critical hour of need. the Office for In a special way, and on behalf of the six Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries affected by the famine, the Government of Malawi wishes to thank the Secretary-General and the United Nations family for successfully organizing the Consolidated National Appeals for the Humanitarian Crisis in Southern Africa, which took place on 18 July 2002, here at United Nations Headquarters. We are grateful for the outcome of the appeal, and we would like to extend similar sentiments of appreciation to all that made Governments and donor organizations pledges and commitments funding requirements of the appeal. towards the timely appointment In addition, we welcome and applaud of the Secretary-Generals the Executive Director of the World Food Programme, Mr. James Morris, as his Special Envoy for the southern African humanitarian crisis. Mr. Morriss personal meetings and consultations with the Heads of State and Government of the six southern African countries and his tour of the subregion have led to useful high-level exchanges that will form an important basis for tackling the problem of food insecurity in future. We undertake to work with him and give him all the the fulfilment of his mandate. support and cooperation necessary for in The high levels of poverty and the deepening scourge of the HIAIDS pandemic and other transmissible diseases afflicting our people continue to ravage populations the developing countries, particularly those of Africa. We take no relief from the annual reports for the year 2002 released by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the World Health Organization, whose graphic statistical data and hard facts portray an unabating, vicious and complex interplay between structural poverty and a startlingly high HIAIDS prevalence in poor countries. The resulting humanitarian crisis threatens millions more lives over the next few years. resource commitments by Africa needs closer attention and concrete actions, as well as deeper the international community, to help build sustainable capacity to address the critical poverty issues and excessive mortality from HIAIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other diseases. These are extremely sensitive issues, and the international donor community should consider, on an emergency basis, the difficult moral issues and the choices involved. suddenly institutions have It is extremely troubling that some Member States and donor taken a minimalist approach to the central role played by United Nations funds and programmes in tackling health problems in the developing countries. It is needless to remind this Assembly that the work of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in tackling the HIAIDS pandemic, in the implementation of the Programme of Action adopted at the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) and in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HI AIDS is very crucial. We call upon donors and multinational institutions to reconsider their decision and to restore funding to UNFPA. relief and forgiveness. Further, we call upon multilateral donor institutions and industrialized countries to grant deeper debt Transnational organizations, which extract huge profits from their business operations in poor countries, have the moral responsibility to invest in HIAIDS prevention, care, support and treatment. International pharmaceutical corporations, too, ought to show more compassion by expanding access to antiretroviral drugs and other life- sustaining meaningful medicines, concessions on price and voluntary donations. We note with gratitude the positive steps taken by some pharmaceutical companies that direction. including reduction in My Government acknowledges the important role played by the United Nations in mobilizing support and resources for the development process in the poor countries. It is not enough, however, to hold one conference after another without effective follow-up and implementation mechanisms. There is therefore a need for supportive global processes that would ensure shorter time lags between the adoption of programmes of action and their implementation. As home to one of the largest numbers of victims of the HIAIDS pandemic in the world, southern It is our hope that the establishment of the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed 29 in include Countries the United Nations Secretariat will promote regular consultations and closer follow-up of agreed programmes of action to ensure their fulfilment. Such programmes of action the Brussels Declaration and Programme of Action of the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, the International Conference on Financing for Development and other commitments flowing from the recent General Assembly special sessions on HI AIDS and children. An earnest attempt is necessary to link up the commitments and agreed outcomes of the Brussels Programme of Action and the Monterrey Consensus in order to create a rich resource base for the implementation of the Johannesburg Plan of Action for sustainable development. Other major problems and challenges that are faced by poor countries and stifle their progress have previously been extensively covered and debated in the Assembly and in various other international forums. But some of them need to be mentioned again. The transition of poor countries from continued dependence on international charity to self-reliance is contingent on certain factors such as free and open trade. Agricultural and other commodities from developing countries need to gain access to Western markets without unnecessary barriers. It is ironic and morally unacceptable that products from the West are freely offloaded onto our markets but not the other way round. Fair trade is a two-way transaction, and every endeavour must be made to ensure that it remains so. On an optimistic note, we welcome the commendable progress that has been achieved in an effort to bring some conflicts in Africa to resolution. This engenders the hope for the eventual restoration of stability and a chance for decisive peace on the continent. The ceasefire agreement reached on 4 April this year in Angola and the peace agreement signed on 30 July between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo represent notable historic milestones in bringing to an end the conflicts in the Great Lakes region. I am confident that the United Nations will use that opening to step forward, as it always has, to strengthen its involvement and that of the international community to consolidate those agreements and closely monitor their implementation. I take this opportunity to congratulate the people and the Government of East Timor on their attainment of independence after many decades of dehumanizing 30 subjugation. My Government also welcomes East Timors coming membership in the United Nations. In the same vein, I congratulate Switzerland on its admission to the membership of the United Nations. The significance of this historic development to the world body cannot be over-emphasized, especially given the invaluable contribution the Government and people of Switzerland have made over the years to the progressive development of international humanitarian and human rights affairs. in the Middle East, particularly My Government is concerned at the unrelenting the bloodletting innocent civilians. We senseless carnage among encourage both the Palestinian Authority to give peace a chance through dialogue. We call, in particular, for the cessation of hostilities, provocation and incitement, which only serve to inflame the delicate conflict situation. Israeli Government and the Malawi believes in the principle of universality of human rights. One of the basic rights that every member of the global community can expect to enjoy is the right to freedom of association. It is on the basis of that, and in a spirit of reconciliation, that Malawi believes that the United Nations should seriously reconsider the question of the readmission of the Republic of China. The more than 21 million people of Taiwan should be allowed to freely participate in the affairs of the United Nations without any hindrance, as that is what this Organization stands for. After all, Taiwan, through its rapid growth in the economic, political and social sectors has demonstrated that it has a lot to offer for the good of humanity through the United Nations. for Africas Development Africa is on the threshold of a new beginning aimed at making a lasting clean break with the errors and political missteps of the last five decades. The promulgation of a development blueprint, the New Partnership (NEPAD), provides a very comprehensive, clear focused road map for economic revitalization of the African continent. NEPAD, as a framework for development, contains broad-ranging measures and actions that are reflective of long-term development requirements, as well as constructive and beneficial international and other participation multilateral processes for effective integration of Africa into the global political and economic order. a new vision regional, for in It is gratifying, therefore, that the international community is willing to support this newly emerging pragmatic framework for partnership and ownership of development on the continent. I would like, once again, to encourage our development partners to join in and support Africas new quest for economic recovery and sustainable development. terrorism remains today one of the greatest threats to human security. The Commonwealth of Dominica therefore once again reaffirms its commitment to the fight against international terrorism and to ensuring that terrorist-related activities and international crime are permanently disabled. the channels for funding of In conclusion, Malawi, along with other African countries, would like to express deep gratitude to the leaders of the Group of 8 countries for voicing unequivocal support for NEPAD. We are thankful for the creation of the Group of 8 Africa Action Plan adopted at the recent Summit in Kananaskis in Canada, which will operate as the platform for enhanced cooperation and partnership between Africa and the industrialized Group of 8 countries. We are confident that strong international networking and support for NEPAD will provide a solid basis for growth and progress, as well as decisive peace and political stability in Africa. "}}
