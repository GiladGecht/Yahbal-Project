{"speech":{"0":" Let me begin by congratulating you on your election as President of the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I am confident that given your vast experience and diplomatic skills you will be able to steer this session to a successful conclusion. like to your distinguished predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo of the outstanding manner in which he conducted the work of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. the Republic of Korea, I would also to pay tribute for In addition, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the Swiss Confederation as the 190th Member of our family of nations. We are confident that its membership, which formalizes its long involvement with the United Nations, will contribute enormously to the work of the Organization. We look forward to welcoming our newly the independent neighbour, Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, as the 191st Member of the United Nations in the very near future. Malaysia would also like to congratulate Africa on the establishment of the African Union and on its bold new initiatives, such as the New Partnership for Africas Development. thank I also the Secretary General for his statement before the General Assembly. Malaysia shares his concerns over the four issues identified as threats to world peace. A year has passed since the evil and cowardly attacks against the Organizations host country. As a result, the world has changed fundamentally in many ways. The been galvanized into fighting all forms of terrorism. There is greater recognition that terrorism is a global problem that crosses borders and lurks in many of our countries, often without our knowledge. international community has The Security Council has taken prompt action resulting in mandatory measures aimed at eliminating all forms and manifestations of terrorism and requiring Member States to take legal, administrative, financial control and other law enforcement measures. Malaysia supports that action and reiterates its commitment to comprehensively fighting terrorism in all its forms at the domestic, regional and international levels. terrorist groups Domestically, our Government has acted swiftly and decisively against that have threatened both our national security and international security. We have cooperated extensively at the bilateral level by sharing intelligence information and by implementing measures to cripple transnational crime networks that abet terrorist activities. In the Southeast Asian region, Malaysia and its partners in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations have embarked on a programme of collaboration to deal with the issue at the regional level. At the international level, in addition to our support of United Nations actions and other international and bilateral efforts to fight the member States of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and of the Commonwealth. terrorism, Malaysia works closely with terrorism, However, Malaysia believes that in our quest to combat the norms and principles of international law should not be set aside. We also believe that in dealing with the menace, it is important for the international community to forge a broad If the consensus on what constitutes terrorism. Without a clear and common definition, certain perpetrators of terrorist acts will justify their actions in the name of State security or national liberation. the collective effort of international community to win the fight against terrorism is to succeed, we must start looking at the problem in a comprehensive manner and must respond with a comprehensive strategy. It seems that in our urgency to address the problem, we overlook and continue to ignore why it exists in the first place. We forget that, however unjustified, in political and economic grievances that still have not been adequately addressed. The fight against terrorism is not merely a fight against the perpetrators and conspirators of terrorist acts; it is also a fight against poverty, injustice, subjugation and illegal occupation that breed anger and hatred. There can be no comprehensive victory against terrorism if the root causes of terror are not eliminated. is often rooted terrorism Malaysia also regrets the continued association in certain quarters of Islam and Muslims with terrorism, as if one were synonymous with the other. We would like to reiterate that no race or religion should be condemned or discriminated against simply because some misguided people from that community are, or may have been, involved in terrorist activities. Just as it is easy and convenient to hold a monolithic view of the Muslim world and therefore assume the worst about every adherent of the Islamic faith, it is also easy for Muslims to have a similarly monolithic and incorrect view of other civilizations. If we continue to view each other in such terms, the confidence that has been engendered in the international community in our fight against terrorism can be eroded. therefore It is with those considerations in mind that Malaysia continues to call for the convening of a high- level international conference under the auspices of the United Nations to examine the terrorism issue in all its forms and manifestations and to formulate a joint response to this global threat. Malaysia is concerned at the apparent lack of urgency in addressing the underlying factors that lead to cause terrorism. For example, most of the Muslim world believes that one of the key outstanding issues that continue to elicit resentment and fury is the territories. situation the Palestinian occupied in 7 their in particular the destruction of Malaysia believes that, while all acts of violence against innocent civilians — whether inflicted by suicide bombers or by security forces — must be condemned, we must be even-handed in our approach in dealing with the situation in the region. It is important that we understand the root causes of violence there. We must put it in its proper context: the continued occupation of Arab lands by the Israeli occupying forces, the demolition of Palestinian homes, the devastation of their towns and cities, livelihood and institutions and, worst of all, the loss of thousands of civilian lives and the wounding of tens of thousands more over the decades, which can only result in reactions Israels oppressive policies and practices have made life for the Palestinians unbearable and have engendered only hatred and resentment against the occupying Power, illegal settlers and those who are perceived to provide support to them. Israel must take advantage of the acceptance of the two-State solution and recognize that political and security issues must be looked at together. It must the establishment of an international protection force to separate the two parties. the Palestinian people. acknowledge the need from also for The including international community, the United Nations, cannot afford to stand on the sidelines indefinitely. It is time for the Security Council to become more actively involved and intervene directly in the situation, beginning with the dispatch of a United Nations or other international peacekeeping force to the occupied territories. Failure to act will only perpetuate the violence and exacerbate the resentment felt by the Palestinians — and by the Muslim world in general — towards those who are perceived to be responsible for refusing to address this issue in a fair and just manner. importantly, We are pleased that Afghanistan is now on the threshold of becoming a viable, progressive and democratic State. However, many impediments to national unity and cohesion remain. These must be overcome through sustained international support and, more the political will and commitment of the people of Afghanistan themselves. Such support should increased infusion of development funds and other forms of assistance and, more urgently, the promotion of a more secure environment in the whole country. We owe it to the long-suffering Afghan people to assist in the the form of through take 8 rehabilitation of their country and to ensure that the circumstances that led to their civil strife are removed and the immediate task of removing terrorist elements in Afghanistan is completed. they will not be abandoned once that If the international community does not focus its efforts on comprehensively fighting terrorism by attempting to find a credible settlement between the Palestinians and the Israelis, and on nation-building efforts in Afghanistan, it risks being dragged into opening up battle fronts that could result in greater instability the world and hamper efforts at combating terrorism. in In particular, we remain concerned that targeting Iraq outside the framework of the United Nations and in contravention of international law would not only be wrong, but result in a more volatile world order. In this regard, we welcome the decision of the United States to work with the United Nations to address this issue rather than pursue a unilateral policy of military intervention. Malaysia agrees that the United Nations must not be cast aside. Engaging the international community through the United Nations, however, must not be merely an exercise in public diplomacy. The international community cannot be made to assume that military intervention against Iraq, in pursuit of both disarmament and regime change, is inevitable and that the United Nations is being engaged only as a matter of course. The strength and relevance of this Organization has never come from affirming the unilateral designs of one Member nation; rather, it rests on the collective will of the international community that emerges from a multilateral process. Engaging international community means initiating this consensual approach, concerns, without which can destabilizing the norms of international law. region, within address the security the it is In that imperative this effort, the international community be presented with clear and incontrovertible evidence of the perceived threat posed by Iraq to regional and international security. At the same time, every diplomatic and political effort should be made to urge Iraq to fully cooperate with the United Nations, including by allowing the return of United Nations weapons to comply with Security Council resolutions, as every State Member of inspectors, and this Organization must do, so as resolution to this issue. to facilitate a the West, especially A pre-emptive attack against Iraq without any credible evidence being provided to the international community of the threat it poses will have serious implications for the international campaign against terrorism. Such an attack may produce real cleavages and draw imaginary battle lines between the Muslim world and the continued oppression of the Palestinians remains unattended-to. Such an attack could swell the discontented in the Muslim world. It would provide a pretext for depraved extremist groups bent on stoking the flames of populist radicalism to mobilize and multiply. While it is important, therefore, to view the Iraq issue in terms of regional security, it is equally important to understand the broader consequences that will follow. ranks of if the In our interdependent world, to strengthen the multilateral process is now more urgent than ever if we are to achieve our common goal of a just and humane international order based on international cooperation and solidarity. the need in ensuring the centrality of The broader membership of this Organization has a vital stake the multilateral process as embodied by the United Nations and its specialized and affiliated agencies. Through it, the Members of the Organization can articulate their concerns and exercise their collective will in the protection and promotion of their interests. It is therefore important to ensure that the Organization and all that it stands for are not set aside on the basis of expediency or the exigencies of the moment. In this context we are reassured by the Secretary-Generals emphasis on the imperative of the multilateral process. As the country that will hold the forthcoming chairmanship of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), Malaysia will work together with other NAM members to ensure the continued centrality of this process, including the promotion of their development agenda. In this context, we must continue to exert our combined efforts to ensure that globalization works for the benefit of all. In order to achieve this, we will have to create an international environment that is more conducive to satisfying the legitimate development priorities and needs of developing countries, as well as to addressing the economic imbalances prevailing in the world today. The United Nations has a pivotal role in strengthening the multilateral process. It is ironic that in an era of enormous economic, financial and technological resources and capabilities, the world is witnessing a dangerous crisis of confidence in the credibility of multilateralism as a result of certain negative trends in the international system. This challenge must be squarely and urgently addressed and remedial action taken here at the United Nations and in other relevant international forums. It is the expectation of States Members of the Organization that the United Nations will play a crucial and leading role in all of these efforts. Therein lies the continued relevance of the United Nations to its Member States. "}}
