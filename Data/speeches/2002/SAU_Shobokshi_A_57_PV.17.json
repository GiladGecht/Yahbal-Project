{"speech":{"0":" I have the honour to deliver the statement of the Government of Saudi Arabia on behalf of His Royal Highness the Minister for Foreign Affairs. 22 It gives me great pleasure at the outset of the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly to convey to Mr. Kavan personally and to his friendly country, sincerest congratulations on his election important position of President of the Assembly. We are confident that he will preside with great skill and efficiency over our deliberations. the Czech Republic, our the to I wish to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, who presided over the last session with wisdom and experience and deserves our gratitude and appreciation. I also wish to take this opportunity to express our thanks and appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his tireless efforts to achieve peace and consolidate security throughout the world and for his persistent efforts to strengthen the Organizations role and enhance its efficiency. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia believes that the recent admission of Switzerland to membership of this Organization will enrich the United Nations and undoubtedly enhance its role, given that countrys remarkable contributions in international cooperation. to and experience Our current session coincides with the first anniversary of the horrendous disaster that befell the United States of America as a result of a most despicable act of terrorism that led to the death of thousands of innocent lives, with enormous material losses and immeasurable harm from which we are all still suffering. The pain and suffering of the American people over the loss of their relatives and loved ones as a result of this cowardly act was our loss, too, as we witnessed those events in a state of total shock and dismay. We felt nothing but absolute condemnation for those who committed that utterly criminal and barbaric act. I therefore convey our sincerest condolences and heartfelt sympathies to the President of the United States, to the families of the victims and to the American people. I assure them that this horrible experience can only strengthen what we already know about the inner strength and pride of the American people. Those feelings of fortitude and resolve, as well as their determination to confront this challenge and to move on with resolve, guided by the principles and values of the founding fathers of their great nation, were unmistakable when we, along with the American people and President, commemorated anniversary of the tragedy. the first It was most overwhelmingly painful for us to see a number of our young people, who were in a position to contribute beneficially to the development and well- being of their own country, fall victim to those who led them astray as they embarked on a road that ended tragically. Those young men committed a grave offense against their country and their religion, which totally and utterly forbids the crime they committed. May I be permitted here to quote from the letter sent to United States President George W. Bush by His Royal Highness Crown Prince Abdullah, in describing those young men in a most unambiguous and meaningful manner: “We in Saudi Arabia felt especially acute pain at the realization that a number of young Saudi citizens had been enticed and deluded and their reasoning subverted to the degree of denying the tolerance that their religion embraced and turning their backs on their homeland, which has always stood for understanding and moderation. They allowed themselves to be used as a tool to do great damage to Islam, a religion they espoused, and to all Muslims. “I would like to make it very clear that real Muslims throughout the world will never allow a minority of defiant extremists to speak in the name of Islam and distort its spirit of tolerance. “Your friends in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia denounced and condemned the attacks of 11 September as strongly as the American people did. Like them, we are convinced that nothing can ever justify the shedding of innocent blood or the taking of lives and the terrorizing of people, regardless of cause or motive. Therefore, we do not simply reiterate our sincere condolences to the victims relatives; we also assure all of our continued will and determination to do all we can to combat that malignant evil and uproot it from our world. My country will maintain its firm resolve to combat terrorism unilaterally and jointly with the international coalition. We shall pursue the war against terrorism relentlessly. Our drive emanates from our firm conviction that terrorism is a pernicious disease that poses a lethal threat to every human society and every effort must be made to confront and defeat it.” Saudi Arabias position regarding terrorism has always been very clear, dispassionate and responsible. That is logical since our country was honoured by God to be the custodian of the Muslims holiest sites, and it is also the birthplace of the heavenly message of Islam. Thus, we want to uphold the principles and teachings of the Islamic faith. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reaffirms its total support for all Security Council resolutions related to the question of terrorism. It has been cooperating fully with the international community in implementing those resolutions, with the aim of combating terrorism. Moreover, Saudi Arabia has taken the necessary steps to close any gaps in regulations related to charitable fundraising illegal purposes. that might be exploited for The competent authorities in Saudi Arabia have put in place all the necessary measures to implement Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). Moreover, the Government of Saudi Arabia has lent its support to every international effort, within the framework of the Security Council, to crack down on terrorism by all means approved by the international community. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has itself suffered from terrorist acts, has enacted regulations that mete out punishment to the perpetrators of terrorist acts. Moreover, it has made the fight against terrorism part of its basic school curricula. At the regional level, Saudi Arabia was one of the first countries to sign the Pan-Arab Convention for the Suppression of Terrorism, adopted by the League of Arab States in 1998, and it is also a signatory to the Convention of Islamic Conference on Combating International Terrorism. the Organization of the At the international level, Saudi Arabia is a party to 10 conventions and agreements that deal with various forms of terrorism. We sincerely look to the United Nations, which represents all countries of the world, to make the international effort to combat terrorism a truly global one, without bias or discrimination, with the primary goal of serving all members of the international community and protecting them from the evils of terrorism, including State- supported terrorism. Confronting terrorism, international cooperation in the exploration of all ways and means to eradicate it terrorist organizations and tracking down 23 represent important steps towards eliminating that dangerous phenomenon. However, the international effort against terrorism, regardless of its effectiveness, will not be capable of that phenomenon unless it addresses its underlying causes, including political, economic and social circumstances that become ground for extremism, violence and terrorism. totally eradicating The decision to eradicate terrorism has been taken, without hesitation or vacillation. However, if our true objective is to eradicate the possibility of its recurrence, then attention must be paid to the political, economic and social conditions that, in many instances, create grounds for extremism, especially when those conditions reach serious proportions and the possibility for peaceful change and development does not exist. to intentions For example, the deteriorating conditions of oppressed people, whether they suffer injustice and oppression or are subject to foreign occupation, and the international communitys inability, for one reason or another, to find just solutions to those problems will ultimately lead to a situation in which opportunity is created for people with evil take advantage of naive young men who are led to believe that violence and terrorism are the only and ideal means for correcting the injustice that afflict them. since the Palestinian people came under the suffocating Israeli occupation. The cycle of violence in the occupied Palestinian the legitimate rights of the Palestinians are respected. Those the international community as a whole and are enshrined in many United Nations resolutions and have become legally international agreements signed by consecutive Israeli Governments with the Palestinian side. rights have been acknowledged by territories will never end unless Thirty-five years have passed through binding various The obligations contained in those agreements have been completely ignored by the Israelis, whether they relate to the continuation of the occupation or the treatment of the Palestinian people and their legitimate leadership. siege, The policy of the destruction of property and starvation, military incursions, the desecration of holy places totally contravenes not only signed agreements, but also international law and humanitarian norms. 24 Furthermore, the Government of Ariel Sharon is marginalizing the Palestinian Authority, established under the Oslo Accords, isolating the Palestinian territories and destroying In addition, with nothing left to destroy, recently Sharon has implemented a policy not only of imprisoning, but also of assassinating, members of the Palestinian leadership. He recently and blatantly declared that Israel is no longer bound by any agreement signed with the Palestinians, including the Oslo Accords. infrastructure. their in The situation the occupied Palestinian territories will undoubtedly lead to a humanitarian disaster resulting from the unchecked spread of disease and the virtual collapse of public health and security forces. the economic siege, The most important fact to be recalled by all, particularly the Israeli people, is that the goal of security promised by the current Israeli Government will never materialize. That is due directly to the policies and practices of that Government, which chose to ignore dialogue and negotiations and opted for oppression and violence as a means of resolving the Palestinian problem. Israelis, without providing President Bushs statement to the Assembly concerning the difficulty of attaining peace between the Palestinians and the freedom necessary for both, conforms with the current situation in the occupied territories, which continue to face a cycle of violence and suffering because one side, namely the Palestinians, has been denied its right to freedom and independence. Therefore, the exit point of that dilemma is Israels acknowledgement of the importance of the existence of a Palestinian State established on a basis of constitutional legality and capable of conducting negotiations and resolving pending problems that cannot be ignored or bypassed. That is the action that must be taken if we truly intend to put an end to the crisis in the occupied territories, the price of which is being paid by both Palestinians and Israelis. We believe that an independent Palestinian State, based on a constitution binding on all Palestinians, and specifying the basis and rules governing their relations with Israel, will ultimately constitute a guarantee not only for the Palestinians, but also for the Israelis themselves, because the Israeli side will have the assurance of dealing with a legitimate entity with clear characteristics, structures and institutions. Their future relations will determine their responsibilities. To achieve this goal, the international community must move to end the humanitarian catastrophe and suffering faced by the Palestinian people. There is also a dire need to halt the violence raging in the area through a practical and dispassionate treatment of the security situation. That clearly means that the international community must hold the Israeli Government accountable to the same level of security obligations that is required of the Palestinian Authority. To limit the security obligations to the Palestinian side alone is neither practical nor a means of solving the problem. It is incumbent on all of us to work together to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinians and to take the necessary practical steps to put the Palestinian problem on the path to the desired settlement. As far as the comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict is concerned, we see in the Arab peace initiative adopted at the Beirut Arab Summit a historic move that contains all the requirements for a just and permanent peace in the Middle East based on resolutions of international legitimacy and supported by all Arab States. It would lead to Israels full withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and to normalization of Arab relations with Israel. resolutions. There is another problem that has reached crisis proportions and has become a source of grave danger to the security and stability of the Middle East: the issue of Iraq and its implementation of the relevant Security Council President Bush mentioned in his speech before the General Assembly the need to refer this matter to the Security Council in order to have the appropriate resolutions adopted. That represents a new and positive approach that we view with satisfaction. Without a doubt, that step has led to a new climate, resulting in the decision of the Iraqi Government to allow the unconditional return of United Nations weapons inspectors. That development, which will avert confrontation through diplomatic means, shows that a positive step will, in most cases, lead to a reciprocal positive step. At this point, it is appropriate to express our satisfaction with the Iraqi Governments prompt response to the call of the ministerial committee of the League of Arab States, which met in parallel with the General Assembly. We believe the Security Councils responsibility to undertake serious efforts to alleviate the suffering of the brotherly people of Iraq. We also believe that it is now the responsibility of Iraq to is now that it promptly carry out its pledges to allow the return of the United Nations weapon inspection teams without prior conditions. the largely upon The world has suffered great destruction and human misery during the last century, which was characterized by bloody confrontations, hate, conflicts and violence. In a world of intertwined dependencies and common interests, the peace and stability of humankind depend international communitys determination to forsake wars, renounce violence, combat terrorism and settle disputes by peaceful means and through the promotion of a culture of peace and dialogue, as well as by consolidating international cooperation, tolerance and understanding. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia calls for the establishment of an international humanitarian order based on a new form of partnership between the developed and developing countries, on a solid basis of cooperation, solidarity and international economic relations built on justice, equality, mutual benefits and joint responsibilities. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia looks forward to a twenty-first century governed by the rule of law and not by brutal force, a century of true pluralism in which everyone will participate in managing the affairs of the present and in creating the future, instead of excluding and ignoring others. We look forward to a year in which the moral values that govern human behaviour will prevail and in which the banners of justice, mercy and interaction among peoples will be raised in order to achieve security, stability and peace for all humanity.
