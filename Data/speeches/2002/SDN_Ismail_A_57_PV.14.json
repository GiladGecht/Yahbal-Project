I should also like to express, on behalf of the people and the Government of the Sudan, sincere congratulations to the people and the Government of Switzerland on its accession to the Organization. In addition, I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate, on behalf of the people and the Government of the Sudan, the State of East Timor on its coming admission as a Member of the United Nations. A full year has passed since the deplorable terrorist events of 11 September, which terrified this city, site of the Organizations Headquarters, where the flags of all our countries fly and where we meet to deliberate on peace, security and justice. The anniversary of the World Trade Center tragedy is an occasion to strengthen international solidarity and resolve to combat terrorism, prompting us to reaffirm our conviction that terrorism is an elusive enemy that knows no religion, ethnicity or homeland. It is a challenge that should be met with a collective international effort. The war on terrorism should be waged with close national, regional and international cooperation and coordination, in conformity with the principles of international law and under the umbrella of the United Nations. The Sudan, while reiterating its commitment to, participation in and support for the international campaign against terrorism, would like to draw the attention of the international community to the feelings of anxiety expressed in various parts of the world at the derailment of the campaign, whose path and objectives are no longer on target, and at its manipulation by the forces of extremism and advocates of confrontation among civilizations and cultures. The situation in the Arab and Islamic world in general, and in the Middle East in particular, reflects that anxiety and those feelings. Therefore, we in the Sudan, current Chair of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, reaffirm our rejection and denunciation of international that derailment and urge that the 4 campaign against terrorism comply with the rules of international law. We strongly support the call of His Excellency Mr. Hosni Mubarak, President of Egypt, for the convening of an international conference on terrorism. double hatred, bigotry, The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization, submitted to the current session, reflects the desire of the worlds countries to strengthen cooperation, to alleviate poverty, to eliminate the debt burden and to resolve conflicts in order to create a world of justice and equality, free of grievances, injustice, standards, conspiracies and politicization, which run counter to the noble objectives of protecting and enhancing human rights. Sudan reaffirms its firm conviction that the United Nations remains the ideal mechanism for achieving international cooperation. Therefore, Sudan reaffirms its readiness to cooperate fully in all areas with United Nations organs. Based on its conviction, Sudan calls for the revitalization of all United Nations organs and urges that top priority be accorded the Security Council and the General Assembly in that regard. in all During the past year, Sudans relations with the United Nations made great progress, a progress crowned by the important and successful visit of Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Khartoum. The visit was a good opportunity for him to see our countrys positive development fields. The visit strengthened the cooperation between the Sudan and the international Organization. This year has also seen visits to the Sudan by the Directors-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the World Intellectual Property Organization is maintaining good channels of communication and coordination with its specialized agencies through cooperation, on the basis of the fundamental principles of its foreign policy, including the principle of openness at the regional and international levels, and in consonance with its strong commitment to active participation in all activities aimed at carrying out the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. the United Nations and (WIPO). The Sudan The United Nations Charter calls the and important peaceful emphasizes the important role of regional organizations for resolution of disputes the and (IGAD) organizations, on Development therein. The Sudan is currently presiding over two Intergovernmental regional Authority the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). In some countries of these two organizations there are conflicts that are the subject of much thought in the world today. IGAD is endeavouring to resolve the conflicts in Somalia and the Sudan. Through the OIC, whose membership includes Pakistan, Iraq, Palestine and Bosnia and Herzegovina, among 57 other countries forming almost one third of the General Assembly, we are sparing no effort to find solutions to serious conflicts at the national and regional levels. conflict, by lawful ending the international Without resolving the root causes of the Arab- occupation, Israeli resolutions, implementing restoring the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including its right to establish an independent state with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, peace, security and stability will not be achieved in this volatile region of the world. We would like to stress the importance of a political settlement of the dispute between Iraq and the United Nations. In this regard, we would like to spare Iraq and the region the risk of yet another war. As Chairman of the OIC, the Sudan has initiated contacts with the United Nations Secretary-General, the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent Security Council members and the Foreign Minister of Iraq; these efforts were crowned with the unconditional acceptance by Iraq of the return of the inspectors. We commend the brave decision of the Iraqi leadership to allow the return of the United Nations inspectors and hope that this will lead to the lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq and the consolidation of its security, sovereignty and territorial integrity so as to enable it to regain its active role both regionally and internationally. The birth of the African Union last year was a great African event, which renewed the aspirations and hopes of the continent for total liberation from the nightmare of conflict, poverty and underdevelopment in order to achieve solidarity, unity, security and comprehensive sustainable development there. We look forward to working closely with the new international organization, the mechanisms established, such as its Peace and Security Council, so that we can coordinate the advancement of our continent through effective bilateral cooperation the African Union, through the and effective countries the sincere desire of between regional cooperation with economic groupings and partnerships. In this connection, the New Partnership for Africas Development (NEPAD) has emerged as testimony to the ability of the continent to initiate and coordinate initiatives among African countries. It also reflects the continent for cooperation through this initiative, with its clearly stated socio-economic priorities. The various regions of the continent have also determined their priorities in the fields of infrastructure, energy, environment, communications, education, health and primary care. I call upon the international community to support Africa through this new partnership so that it will attain its aspirations. We also call on Africa to speak with one voice regarding the follow-up and implementation of NEPAD through the mechanisms of the African Union, our collective organization. With regard to developments in my country, I have the honour to inform you of the latest endeavours to resolve the conflict in southern Sudan. I would recall that my Government has always considered the issue of peace and ending the war in the southern part of the country a priority and a strategic objective. This stems from our conviction that national peace leads to regional peace, which in turn leads to international peace, to which we all aspire. My country has spared no effort to find a solution to the root causes of the conflict. To that end, we have organized national conferences and meetings, and we have also responded positively to the various regional and international efforts aimed at ending the conflict. Against this background, and under the auspices of an IGAD efforts of initiative intermediaries, the Rebel Movement have signed on 20 July of this year the Machakos framework agreement. This agreement was widely acknowledged as a step towards eventual peace, supported both the country. However, the rebel movement has set that progress back with its insistence on military activities and on re- opening issues already agreed upon during the first round of talks. This regrettable development forced the Government to suspend the negotiations. the the Government and inside and outside led by Kenya and My Government believes that it is meaningless to continue military activities after signing the peace protocol. My Government will continue to fulfil its responsibility for protecting our territorial integrity and national security and for seeking solutions to the dire 5 humanitarian situation of our citizens affected by the military activities of its responsibility to secure peace and stability for all citizens. the rebels, as well as While I am setting out the important political and constitutional developments in my country, let me stress my Governments policy of consolidating democracy and promoting human rights in Sudan, particularly after the positive steps taken in the areas of political freedom and freedom of the press. This course of action opened the door wide for the participation of all our citizens at the national level. foreign regard Sudans policy with transparency. Inspired by to international and regional organizations has been guided by a clear vision based on well-defined principles — namely, openness towards others, effective participation in all international and regional forums and constructive dialogue based on objectivity and these positions of principle, Sudan to playing a constructive role on issues of regional cooperation in Africa and among its neighbours. Sudan is well qualified to play such a role because of its unique geopolitical situation and its human and natural resources. With this policy, Sudans relations with its African and Arab neighbours have witnessed successful breakthroughs in economic cooperation, mutual trade and strategic partnerships. looks forward The same applies to our interaction with the United States, which is now entering its third year. The American-Sudanese relationship has witnessed some positive developments and our relations, which were ruptured, have progressed to the point where the United States is fully involved in efforts aimed at reaching a peaceful settlement in the Sudan. We are fully cognizant of the political and economic weight of the United States, as well as its effective role in all regional and international issues. As such, we are keen to further enhance balanced relations with the United States. Armed with faith in our just position with regard to the pending issues between the two countries, we remain confident that our relations with the United States will progress in the near future and will be characterized by cooperation, as long as both sides continue to remain committed to a policy of dialogue rather than confrontation. We are also confident that an in-depth dialogue will lead us to consolidate trust between the two 6 countries in a manner that will spare us the bitterness of the past. The unfortunate case of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical plant, which was falsely alleged to to produce chemical weapons, bears witness the significance of such a confidence-building process. The end of the twentieth century witnessed many wars and conflicts that preoccupied the international community. The negative impact of globalization continues to widen the gap between the countries of the North and the South. Although considerable progress has been achieved in international cooperation thanks to qualitative improvements at the United Nations and the commendable role played by its Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, some issues and challenges continue to preoccupy international community.
