{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of the Government and people of Solomon Islands, I wish to congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the fifty-seventh session 3 of the General Assembly. I am confident that, under his experience and skilful leadership, we will reach positive results for this Organization and for all peoples of the world. I also thank His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-Soo, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of Korea, for his distinguished service in presiding over the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. In the same manner, I thank His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General, for his good and untiring efforts and his dedication aimed at realizing the principles and purposes of the United Nations. Like others who have spoken before me, I also wish to congratulate East Timor, our close Pacific neighbour that is soon to be a member of the United Nations, and Switzerland as a new member of the United Nations. Solomon Islands looks forward to developing those two countries through bilateral and multilateral means. relationships with further into journey As we this new millennium, challenges facing the international community are more daunting. Human ingenuity and technological advances complicate those challenges. Acts of terrorism and armed conflicts proliferate in many parts of the world. Prospects for progressive economic and social services and security, and improved living standards for the vast majority of the world(cid:146)s population have become mere unrealized dreams. Nonetheless, as an international instrument for the promotion and the betterment of human life, the United Nations has considerable ability and experience in pursuing what is best for the common good of all peoples around the world, including guaranteeing world peace and security through the Security Council. Today I reaffirm the commitment of Solomon Islands to the principles of the Charter. I also wish to place on record the appreciation of Solomon Islands for the worthy assistance from other United Nations organs and agencies, including the Economic and Social Council, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Educational, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Commission on Human Rights. Scientific Solomon Islands also upholds its faith in the Security Council and acknowledge its important role in 4 in the the maintenance and promotion of international peace and security. At the same time, we recognize the changing scene international political and security environment. Those changes must be reflected in our Organization as well. The reform of the Security Council must continue, including a review on the relevance of the provisions of veto power accorded to permanent members. Moreover, Solomon Islands supports the expansion of the permanent membership of the Council to include Japan and Germany. Those two countries have so much influence in the global political and economic arena and therefore they are better placed to contribute constructively and positively to world peace and security. For a small island nation like Solomon Islands, the United Nations is the foremost institution to turn to in time of trouble and need. My predecessor stated that from this rostrum last year. At that time, he elaborated on the circumstances of the conflict that had erupted in Solomon Islands between November 1998 and October 2000. Today, we are still struggling with the outcome of that devastating conflict. We have lost much. We have to do much more to reconstruct the destroyed fabric of our country. That is the course my Government has charted, in order to maintain our sovereignty with dignity and to show integrity and respect as a Member of the United Nations family. The mandate to lead the country was clearly given to me through the democratic process when Solomon Islands held its post-conflict general election on 5 December 2001. The polls returned a new Parliament of 50 duly elected members, charged with a clear working majority of 29 out of the 50 members. The national coalition Government for peace, unity and reconstruction assumed office and undertook the challenging task of rebuilding Solomon Islands. The foremost strategy that my Government has adopted is to pursue four policy areas: first, the restoration of peace and security; secondly, education; thirdly, health and medial services; and, fourthly, productive sectors. We began this important work during the first 100 days of entering since consolidated our efforts, notwithstanding practical difficulties that emanate from the lack of financial and the absence of other relevant resources. into office. We have Our second strategy is the formulation of a national economic recovery plan. That plan focuses on strengthening agriculture, fisheries, forestry, mining, manufacturing, tourism and infrastructure development sectors. Besides giving closer attention the promotion of health and education services, the plan also addresses population growth and ensures promotion of responsible environmental management. to I am happy to state that, at present, we are also working on a sustainable development plan for our country. An integrated financial package for this strategy has been submitted to our development partners. Thus far, the responses received, while encouraging, still raise questions that require serious and genuine consideration in view of our present circumstances. It is here that we sincerely look to the United Nations for assistance in facilitating closer consultation and constructive engagement with the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank. The huge amount of debt that burdens poor countries is real, and it continues to afflict most third- world countries, including small States such as Solomon Islands. This is a real challenge that my people and country face as we make our best efforts and endeavours to rebuild our nation and maintain our independence and sovereignty with dignity, integrity and respect during these difficult times and in the future. On this important point, the United Nations should consider supporting debt for countries that are debt-strapped. Solomon Islands can be included in this category. forgiveness tributes A few days ago, the people of the City of New York, the United States of America and the rest of the world paid moving thousands of innocent lives tragically lost through the cowardly and senseless acts of terrorism committed on 11 September 2001. The heroic men and women who perished at that sad time now deserve a special place in our hearts and in the annals of history. the to international conventions My Government is taking steps to accede to a number of to counter-terrorist activities. We have communicated these important measures to the United Nations. We seek the assistance of the United Nations and members of the international community to enhance our efforts. relating The increase in armed conflicts and the illegal trade of small arms are directly linked. Armed conflicts the availability of have increased in most parts of the world. They are fuelled mainly by illegal manufacture, official sale or supply of small arms, and this has resulted in the loss of innocent life. Over the past 50 years, small weapons and landmines have killed more people than weapons of mass destruction. the and sociocultural cohesiveness Small arms have also found their way into Solomon Islands, and they have been used in the three- year conflict which has adversely affected my country(cid:146)s good governance. In no uncertain manner, this has crippled the economy. The continuing presence of small arms in communities has posed a major threat to the peace, security and stability of my nation. Any hope of economic threatened by lawlessness. Notwithstanding this, the Government remains committed, within its limited resources, to retrieving arms and restoring confidence to our people in the communities. However, we believe that the international community, through the United Nations, has a pivotal role to play in assisting the country to rid itself of armed threats by taking more ambitious action to curb the arms culture that is taking root in our country. is constantly recovery Peace of mind and safety from danger are not achieved by the mere absence of war. Rather, they are the product of a nation(cid:146)s ability to achieve sustainable economic prosperity, better education, and health and social services for all its people. Peace and security for every human soul comes down simply to meeting the most basic needs. Even with the successful outcome of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, which included promises of economic growth and protection of our environment, Solomon Islands remains sceptical about the practical outcome of action plans for developing and least developed countries. We have committed ourselves to similar action plans for sustainable development in the past. Agenda 21 of 1992 and the Barbados Programme of Action for small island developing States, among others, are valid policy blueprints for sustainable development. Unfortunately, we have not lived up to our commitments. We all have failed. That is why world leaders again assembled, in South Africa, to take stock of our failures and make new commitments. And indeed, new commitments have been made. Now the the commitments made in South Africa. time test to is 5 As The Honourable Laisenia Qarase, Prime Minister of Fiji and Chairman of the Pacific Islands Forum, aptly said in his address at the World Summit, let us turn our words into deeds. Solomon Islands can only hope that, this time around, there is a will to lead us eventually to the goals and objectives set at the World Summit in South Africa. Decade 2001-2010, adopted at the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, is a timely action by all international organizations to refocus attention and global resources on the neediest and poorest countries. We support the immediate implementation of the Programme and note with satisfaction the progress that has been made so far. Solomon Islands is very much aware of its vulnerability to natural and man-induced disasters. Like other small island developing countries, we continue to seek of the international community not only to recognize the uniqueness of our vulnerability but also to take concerted action towards achieving many of our goals and objectives for sustainable development, collectively as a group and individually as nations. the political, The communiquØ issued by the recent Pacific Islands Forum summit held last August in Suva, Fiji, reflects and environmental issues that are important to the region. These need our collective resolve, as well as the attention and cooperation of the wider international community. economic, security The adverse impact of sea-level rise is a threat to the economies and survival of small and low-lying island countries, in particular in the Pacific, the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean. Scientific research and reports, including the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, issued in 2001, have given us all the more reason to be deeply concerned. Solomon Islands joins other small island States in calling again on the countries that have yet to become parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol to do so, and seriously to commit to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. The least developed countries still grapple with the harsh realities of poverty, vulnerability to external economic shocks, debt burden, poor infrastructure, and poor or limited access to better education, health, social services (cid:151) and the list goes on. Even with an increasing commitment to globalization, the situation of many least developed countries and nation-States has neither improved nor stabilized. In many instances, conditions have worsened. Solomon Islands believes the renewed the Brussels Programme of commitment Action for the Least Developed Countries for the through that 6 to in respect the expressed wish of Solomon Islands once again calls upon the United Nations the Government and the people of the Republic of China to be readmitted as a full and equal member of this Organization. The world has marvelled at Taiwan(cid:146)s economic transformation. Within a short span of time, it has not only established a stable and vibrant domestic economy, but also has become one of the world(cid:146)s most terms of international and information technology. Taiwan is a sovereign country in full control of its own affairs and with influence in the world economy, and it is unjust to deny its people the right to stand tall and be counted among the many nations represented in international institutions. influential economies trade, investment outflows Taiwan is a willing and able country, ready to shoulder the obligations of the United Nations and other international organizations. Taiwan has proved itself through its international economic cooperation with many developing and least developed countries. Solomon Islands is convinced that that there are no legal barriers to Taiwan(cid:146)s membership in the United Nations, only political obstacles. Let us therefore cast aside those political obstacles and take a positive approach by according the Government and the people of the Republic of China the membership they deserve and the opportunity to fully participate in the affairs of the United Nations under its Charter.
