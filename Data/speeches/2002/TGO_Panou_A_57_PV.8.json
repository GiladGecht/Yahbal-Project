{"speech":{"0":" The preservation of international peace and security, the fight against terrorism in all its forms, the eradication of poverty throughout the world, the promotion of sustainable development and the establishment of a more just and more human international order are the challenges that we must strive to meet, primarily through the irreplaceable framework of the United Nations. We are meeting once again to find new perspectives in the light of the evolving international situation in order to provide new impetus to our actions by coming together around common objectives. Before continuing my statement, allow me, on behalf of the delegation of Togo and on my own behalf, to address our warmest congratulations to Mr. Kavan on his election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. His election to that high post is a tribute not only to him personally, but also to his great and beautiful country. I assure him of the fullest cooperation of my country towards the success of his mission. I also take this opportunity to convey to his predecessor our full gratitude for the effective way in which he led the work of the previous session. 6 To Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who works tirelessly to strengthen peace and security throughout the world, we reiterate our high appreciation of his commitment and dedication. I congratulate Switzerland and Timor-Leste on their admission into the great United Nations family. Democracy, respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights and good governance are factors in development and peace and values to which Togo has long adhered and to which we are deeply attached. It is in the spirit that we must consider the political reforms that were launched 15 years ago at the initiative of our Head of State. These reforms seek to build a peaceful democracy based on the widest possible national consensus and rooted in the historical and socio- cultural realities of our country. Today, our efforts have led to the establishment and effective operation of almost all the institutions called for in the Constitution of the Fourth Republic, to the restoration of State authority and security and to the revitalization of the national economy. We have achieved these results despite the difficulties that hindered the process of democratization as a result of a poorly begun transition, and despite all kinds of manoeuvres and obstacles constantly set up by an unhelpful opposition. Priority has been placed above all on the continuation of political reforms to ensure that they are undertaken in a climate of restored calm and ongoing concertation among all the political forces of our nation. It was in this context that, at the initiative of the Head of State, Mr. Gnassingbe Eyadema, we launched an inter-Togolese dialogue among all the countrys principal political actors that led to the signing of a framework The implementation of the establishment of a dialogue between the Government and the opposition on such essential political questions as the organizational modalities of early legislative elections. July in agreement 1999. allowed agreement that It was the will of the Head of State and of the Government to ensure that these elections, open to all political groups without exception, should take place in a climate of peace and security, with the necessary guarantees of transparency and legality. It is also our aim that, at the completion of this electoral process, a new phase should begin in our countrys political life with the revitalization of a National Assembly in which political groups that wish to be represented can be so. All of these achievements, which strengthen political pluralism in Togo, deserve the support and encouragement of our partners, particularly those in Europe, with a view to normalizing our relations of cooperation. Unfortunately, that has not been the case. As I stressed a year ago from this very rostrum, the people of Togo do not deserve the treatment they have received. It is now clear that the rash imposition of sanctions as a means of political pressure entails limits beyond which such measures become ineffective and run counter to morality and to the duty of international solidarity. I wish once again to launch an urgent appeal for the resumption of the cooperation that Togo has a right to expect from the international community as an act of and solidarity, support the indisputable efforts that have been made by my Government towards the development of the country and the consolidation of the bases of our democracy in a climate of peace, stability and national harmony. encouragement for Mrs. Ferrero-Waldner (Austria), Vice-President, took the Chair. It is well known that we in Togo have made peace that no and national security our credo, given for sustainable development can be undertaking successfully carried out if the recourse to violence prevails over dialogue, concertation and mutual respect and if the world continues to face such terrorist acts as the tragedy of 11 September 2001. Those terrible events, which are still vivid in our minds, require us, individually and collectively, to respond appropriately to the threats represented by terrorism. Togo, which has been a terrorist aggression, understands the importance of the challenge and spares no effort in assuming its share of the responsibility in this struggle. repeated victim of to We must here welcome the speed with which the United Nations has reacted this problem and contributed to the emergence of an acute awareness of the phenomenon and the dangers it entails for all mankind. Today, as was the case a year ago, it is imperative that we recognize the urgency and need to pursue this campaign. It is clear that we must seek together the factors that will contribute to maintaining peace in all its dimensions. Yes, crises and armed conflicts still afflict the world, unfortunately, in Africa and elsewhere. While it may be true that some glimmers of hope have emerged in Africa with the resolution of the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea and with respect to the settlement of other crises, the situation remains alarming. It is alarming in the Great Lakes region and the Mano River region, which is again experiencing a genuine security problem, with major humanitarian consequences. Whether we are talking about the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Mano river region, the Sudan, Somalia or any other country affected by crises, we reaffirm that only dialogue and negotiation can lead to peace and ensure the lasting settlement of disputes. We therefore urge the parties to such crises and armed conflicts to be more courageous and demonstrate greater political will so as to give peace a chance through negotiating processes already under way and by the that have already been provisions of agreements signed. In recent announcement of the withdrawal, beginning next week, of Rwandan troops from the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and we hope that the implementation of this decision will strengthen the process under way. respecting and effectively implementing this respect, we welcome the The situation in the Middle East also remains worrying. We must find a solution to the vicious circle of violence — violence breeding violence. Togo has always stressed that violence can lead only to bitterness and resentment and that it further perpetuates violence. This cannot be said enough: dialogue and negotiation are the only means that should be used to settle disputes. We therefore strongly urge both Palestinians and Israelis to end the vicious circle of violence and immediately take up negotiations with a view to achieving a just, comprehensive and final settlement of the question of Palestine, which is at the heart of the conflict the Middle East. Of course, such a settlement would require recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to a viable Palestinian State. But it would also entail the recognition of the equally legitimate rights of the Israeli people to live in peace and complete security within internationally recognized borders. in This session began just a few days after the the World Summit on Sustainable conclusion of 7 Development, at which the international community stressed more than ever before the need to protect humankind and the natural world. Now more than ever we must protect humankind its multifaceted character and the environment in all of its variety. in I am pleased to note, too, that this session of the General Assembly is taking place during a historic time for our continent of Africa. Indeed, two years ago, on 12 July 2000, at Lome, Togo, African countries laid the groundwork for a new Africa by adopting, before the whole world, the Constitutive Act of the African Union. The African heads of State or Government solemnly continent-wide organization at Durban in July, thereby translating into reality their determination to shape a new destiny for Africa. launched new the Some might be tempted to say that, despite the establishment of the African Union, nothing decisive will be done and that the continent will still be trying to find itself while stagnating in underdevelopment. It is true that, given the current economic and social situation, such pessimism could be warranted. Indeed, our continent of Africa is still the principal victim of an economic order that is out of balance and unfair — one that all too often deprives it of the fruits of its own labour. that benefit Unstable commodity prices, yearly increases in the price of crucial capital goods, debt, limited access to the markets of industrialized countries for our finished and semi-finished goods and the competition with which our products have to contend as a result of the export subsidy policies of certain rich countries — policies industries — are seriously hampering the development of our countries. Today more than ever it is vital to ask how Africa can reconcile the repayment of its debt with the implementation and development goals. Turning the current situation around is a task that we must undertake through reflection and action. their own economic growth its of The establishment of a new structure — the African Union — marks a decisive turning point in the history of our continent, which, more than ever before, international needs the community development programmes. We are aware that Africa cannot rise to the challenge of growth and development unless it becomes organized to mobilize and make the best use invaluable support of carrying the its out in 8 its of resources using external aid only as a complement to its own efforts. We earnestly hope that the consolidation of various subregional organizations for economic integration, together with the synergistic implementation of the New Partnership for Africas Development, will provide Africa with the means to achieve its ambitions. In conclusion, I should like to stress that the new international context and the multidimensional nature of the problems to be faced mean that we must work with greater determination and solidarity within the United Nations in order to push back insecurity, poverty and misery. In this regard, we must consider providing the wherewithal and the increased resources to enable it to achieve peace and economic and social development for our peoples. shared Organization with this That is the price to be paid for the future of humankind. I earnestly hope that the United Nations will, more than ever before, become the ideal tool to implement our ideals of peace, justice, progress and liberty for the benefit of our peoples. "}}
