{"speech":{"0":" Let me first of all convey greetings and wishes of peace and prosperity to the people of your countries from the President of Turkmenistan, Saparmurat Niyazov. Allow me to congratulate the President on the occasion of his election to such a high and responsible post and wish him success in the organization of the fruitful work of the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I would also the Swiss Confederation and Timor-Leste on their membership this year in the United Nations. to welcome like From independent development, neutral Turkmenistan has cooperated first days of the its closely with the United Nations and considers that cooperation the main direction for its foreign policy. The key issue for Turkmenistan as a neutral country in such conditions is cooperation in the name of peace and security and the well-being and prosperity of its people. We constantly feel that we have the support of the United Nations for our foreign policy initiatives aimed at strengthening these goals. commitment to these international obligations as a permanently neutral State remains unchanged. Our regional processes where The importance of promoting the role of the United Nations is constantly becoming more obvious against the background of current developments of both global and the concentration of collective efforts and the adoption of decisions that take into account various interests are required. Turkmenistan stands for strengthening and broadening the role of the United Nations in the solution not only of global problems, but also in the collective discussion of regional issues and for a more extensive use of the potential of the United Nations and its institutions in proposing and implementing foreign policy initiatives. in We see huge opportunities the close cooperation of the United Nations and its specialized bodies in the implementation of the large-scale national projects. In this context we express our gratitude for the cooperation of the leadership of the United Nations and its specialized agencies, such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Childrens Fund the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCCP) and others. In cooperation with these agencies, the Government of Turkmenistan is carrying out a number of large projects of social and economic orientation that are producing specific results in the areas of health care, social affairs, education, environment and other areas. (UNICEF), More than a year has passed since the tragic events of 11 September 2001, which forced us to evaluate the issues of security of our people and our States scale of measurement and has confirmed the necessity to consolidate efforts in this direction. a qualitatively new through In this context the region of Central Asia has come to the forefront of the worlds attention. In many 29 respects the prospects for peace and security will depend on the way multilateral dialogue develops on these issues in the region. Turkmenistan attaches foremost importance to the role of the United Nations in invigorating regional and interregional dialogue in the search for solutions to emerging problems. In this connection I would like to draw your attention to the initiative of the President of Turkmenistan in creating a regional consultative council of the heads of Government of the countries of Central Asia. This would be a high-level interstate body for regular consultations and the development of joint decisions on matters that touch directly upon the destinies of the States in the region and the real needs of their people. Primarily, these issues would include trade and interaction, energy supply, cross-border economic trade, water use, transportation and humanitarian cooperation. We believe that multilateral consultations on the part of heads of State will contribute to the development and implementation of agreed actions by the parties, on the basis of mutual interests, and will enable the creation of a maximally effective system of rational interaction. In this regard, the initiative of the President of Turkmenistan, Mr. Niyazov, to hold an international conference in Turkmenistan on economic cooperation in Central and South Asia, with the participation of representatives from the region, the United States, Russia, China, Japan, countries of the European Union, other interested States, and international financial and economic institutions, can be considered to be very timely. Such a forum will promote a new system of economic ties between West and East based on joint and equal cooperation of States. Its main goal should be creation of the most favourable conditions for trade, investment activities, and the introduction of modern technology. Moreover, holding such an international conference will make it possible for developed countries to assess the real potential for industrial and social development of States in Central and South Asia. The beginning of work on the trans-Afghan gas pipeline projects using the “Turkmenistan-Afghanistan- Pakistan” route is of great importance in developing regional the construction of the new gas pipeline was signed in May cooperation. The agreement for 30 of this year, in Islamabad, by the Presidents of Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Turkmenistan welcomes the interest shown in this project by large companies, financial and industrial groups, and first of all by the Asian Development Bank, which is taking an active part in the negotiating process for the implementation of the trans-Afghan gas pipeline project. The trans-Afghan gas pipeline is a project on an international scale that has colossal social, economic and political significance, primarily from the point of view of strengthening stability and security in the region. The trans-Afghan gas pipeline, of which more laid than 700 kilometres would be through Afghanistan, has, to its economic component, an invaluable social and humanitarian significance. The construction of the gas pipeline would create jobs for more than 12 thousand Afghans and would also offer a new social infrastructure for Afghanistan. in addition In this connection we call on the United Nations to assist us in the effective implementation of this project. Turkmenistan had suggested earlier, from the same rostrum, the development and adoption, under the United Nations auspices, of an international convention on operating regimes and guarantees for interstate pipelines. Such an instrument would, in our view, allow us to create a reliable political and legal mechanism for providing transportation of critical raw materials to world markets. the safe Turkmenistans foreign policy of positive neutrality is aimed at ensuring secure development and cooperation aimed at social revival in the countries of the region. This entails the creation of new workplaces and fighting against poverty, in other words, everything that today embraces the human dimension. Turkmenistan supports the conclusions reached at the recent Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development. We feel that solutions to current world problems, especially in the humanitarian, social and environmental areas, will require a new approach to the human dimension in world politics. In the 21st century, the notion of sustainable development has acquired a qualitatively new meaning based on steady and stable economic growth. On of the important aspects of sustainable development is maintaining a balance between, on one hand, industrial and technological progress and, on the other, protection of the environment. The realization of this necessity is especially is breached throughout the world. today, when this balance relevant The is striving international community to prevent negative, technology-generated consequences on the environment. A vivid example of that is the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Turkmenistan, having acceded to that important international instrument, is taking an active role in implementing its norms and principles, and international organizations. is cooperating with In the 21st century, the problem connected with the huge deposits of hydrocarbon resources in the basin of the Caspian Sea, which involves not only the countries of the region but also many other countries and multinationals, has come to the attention of the world. It is now known that the deposits of oil and gas in the Caspian Sea are the most important energy resources of the 21st century. Their efficient development, along with the creation of the necessary pipeline infrastructure for bringing energy resources to the world markets, will ensure significant economic growth for many States and ensure the well-being of their people. It is obvious that many countries are interested in the security of the energy resources transit. The United Nations should play an important role in this process. The first summit meeting of the Caspian littoral States in Ashgabat in April of this year, on the initiative of the President of Turkmenistan, could be considered as a qualitatively new stage in this process of agreeing on and developing a mutually acceptable solution to the Caspian problem. At this historic summit, Presidents expressed the will of their State and people, which is to ensure that the Caspian Sea be and remain a sea of friendship and peace. The result of the summit is that the Caspian theme was openly discussed for the first time at such a high level. Strong agreement was reached resolved peacefully and constructively. Thus, the first step towards a common goal — the determination of the status of the Caspian Sea — was made. that problems are to be It is obvious today that effective cooperation and activities relating to the Caspian Sea as a whole are directly connected with ensuring stability the Caspian region. Turkmenistan hopes that the Caspian in region will achieve peace, stability and durable cooperation on the basis of justice and mutual respect. We need collective efforts in order to solve the problems of the international community. The solution of these problems is possible, not through collective efforts alone, but also through the assumption by each member of its individual role and responsibilities. This is the logic guiding the political behaviour of Turkmenistan in its pursuit of the goals of strengthening peace and economic, social and cultural development. Our country is always ready for constructive partnership. The United Nations can rest assured in that respect. international community of the "}}
