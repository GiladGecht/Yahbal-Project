{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, I wish to join other speakers in warmly congratulating you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. My delegation offers you its full support to the presidency(cid:146)s work. I also wish to pay 25 tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, for his able guidance of the last session. It gives me great pleasure to salute here the two new Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Members the Swiss Confederation and the Democratic Republic of East Timor. the United Nations, of Turkey is firmly convinced that, throughout this new century, the need for the United Nations will increasingly grow. the only multilateral Organization with universal membership dedicated to the noble aims of maintaining peace and international security, addressing global issues and establishing standards that should apply to all. is It broader have much Exactly a year ago, evil in its worst form struck New York and Washington, D.C. Since the tragedy of 11 September, it has become amply clear that terrorist organizations international networks than anticipated. Terrorism has many names and faces and recognizes no boundaries. This is a phenomenon that is not confined to and cannot be identified with any particular geography, religion, race or culture. Terrorism is the most blatant violation of human rights. Nothing can ever justify terrorism and there can be no leniency towards it. Turkey has been calling for years for intensified international cooperation against terrorism. We have been actively engaged in the work of the United Nations to fight this scourge and we commend the ongoing efforts. Security Council resolution 1373 (2001), in particular, provides a clear road map with regard to the steps that need to be taken to combat terrorism more effectively. It is incumbent upon all Member States to adopt existing international legislation and to review their relevant national laws accordingly. We urge those States that have not yet done so to become parties to the 12 international conventions on specific terrorist offences. We also look forward to the completion of the work on against international terrorism. comprehensive convention a Preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping have gained even more priority in this era of new conflicts. Turkey has been actively participating in the efforts of the United Nations in conflict prevention and plays a significant role within peace missions mandated by the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 26 and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Hence, we commend the efforts of the Secretary-General to the manifold emerging crises considerations contained in his report () on the prevention of armed conflicts. to ensure prompt and welcome reaction My country took over the command of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Kabul at an extremely critical juncture. We take pride in fulfilling that task and thank the other contributing nations. Indeed, all ISAF personnel are serving with a strong sense of purpose and mission. Traditionally a close friend of the Afghans, Turkey has contributed for many years to the rehabilitation of Afghanistan. We salute the performance of the Transitional Authority under the leadership of His Excellency Mr. Hamid Karzai, the Afghan President. Today we must rapidly embark upon real and tangible development efforts in Afghanistan. It is with this understanding that Turkey provides the Afghan people with assistance that is directed at developing their national potential. Likewise, efforts to build the Afghan national army and the police force as well as solidarity and unity among the ethnic groups are of crucial importance. We feel strongly that the international community should fulfil its commitments adopted at the Tokyo International Conference on Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan. support His Excellency Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, the Special Representative of the Secretary- General for Afghanistan, in his efforts to secure greater financial assistance. The United Nations is to be commended spearheading reconstruction activity. successfully for Turkey is located in close proximity to many of the existing conflict spots and potential new threats that are high on the United Nations agenda. Accordingly, we are closely interested in promoting peace, stability and prosperity in our part of the world, particularly in the Balkans, the Middle East and the Caucasus. We have been witnessing positive changes in the political and security environment of the Balkans. The multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multicultural fabric of the Balkan countries must be preserved. We believe now is the right time for the word (cid:147)Balkans(cid:148) to be freed from its negative connotation and be made to stand for such positive concepts as ethnic harmony, mutual respect and peaceful cohabitation. We hope that the elections in the Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and those to be held in a few weeks(cid:146) time in Kosovo, will be instrumental in shaping a better future for the Balkans. Our resolve to further improve our relations with Greece through the current process of constructive dialogue remains intact. We seek to encourage and foster the spirit of friendship and cooperation so that we can make further progress. In that respect, the two countries signed a number of bilateral documents. As for the Aegean Sea, we believe that Turkish-Greek relations have indeed reached a level of maturity that could enable us to address the issues at hand on a bilateral basis. To that end, we have been discussing certain confidence-building measures and have agreed on some. We are also encouraged by the ongoing exploratory contacts. Regarding Cyprus, we continue to support the efforts aimed at finding a just, viable, lasting and complete settlement. Cyprus is an issue between the two equal, distinct peoples on the island, namely the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots, each of which lives under its own political and democratic structures. The two peoples of Cyprus should be able to coexist and share power under a new partnership State structure on the basis of the equal status and sovereign equality of the two partner States. We will continue to support the current direct talks between the two leaders in Cyprus, which enable the two parties to search for comprehensive reconciliation without any third-party involvement. We believe that equal treatment of both sides will foster an environment that will encourage them to move towards a new partnership of equals, excluding the possibility of reverting to the situation that existed before 1974. We support the recent Turkish Cypriot proposals, which provide a sound and realistic basis for a settlement. We believe that the international community should give due consideration to these proposals, which open a new window of opportunity for the resolution of this longstanding issue. The decision of the European Union Council to start accession negotiations with the Greek Cypriot administration, despite the illegitimacy of its claim to represent island, has made an agreed settlement even more elusive. Unfortunately, the Greek the whole in the island and tensions on Cypriot focus so far has been totally diverted to European Union membership. Membership prior to settlement would create many problems and would lead to the eastern Mediterranean in general. We have reiterated that a unilateral Greek Cypriot entry into the European Union would harm the chances for a mutually agreed settlement establishing a new partnership between the two parties. The European Union must tell the Greek Cypriots that they will not be admitted before a final settlement. That to make meaningful progress towards resolving the Cyprus issue. is essential if we are In the aftermath of 11 September, peace and stability in the Middle East have gained even more importance and urgency. Yet the present outlook of the ongoing conflict does not leave much room for optimism. Violence persists, taking a huge toll on both sides. This year has been marked by successive terrorist the disproportionate use of force by Israel against the Palestinians. The occupation of Palestinian towns and the destruction of Palestinian infrastructure have only exacerbated the already difficult living conditions of the Palestinian people. attacks on civilians Israeli and The parameters of peace in the Middle East are embedded in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Those resolutions have now been given fuller meaning with the adoption of Council resolution 1397 (2001), laying out the vision of two States living side by side within secure boundaries. The international community is also encouraged by the Arab League plan adopted at its Beirut Summit, based on a vision of the coexistence of all States in the region through the full implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions. Likewise, the 24 June statement of the United States President charts the contours of a process that will lead to the two-State objective. Mr. Aguilar Zinser (Mexico), Vice-President, took the Chair. The international community should engage itself in encouraging and persuading all parties to the Middle East conflict on lasting peace. The initiatives of the (cid:147)quartet(cid:148) are welcome, and Turkey, as a regional facilitator, is ready to offer its assistance in whatever way may be necessary. We need a the road to 27 relaunching of the peace process, and Turkey stands ready to host a meeting to that end. problem remains More than a decade after the liberation of Kuwait, the Iraqi unresolved. The repercussions of the Gulf war still prevail. The adverse effects of that situation on the people of Iraq, on Turkey and on the region as a whole are increasing. The only way out for Iraq is to cooperate fully with the United Nations by implementing the relevant Security Council resolutions. Turkey has been encouraging Iraq in that direction. We would like to see an Iraq whose territorial integrity and political unity are preserved and which the international community. is peacefully reintegrated into The Caucasus is another area of close interest for Turkey. We aim to help in establishing comprehensive cooperation in the region. However, the unresolved conflicts in Nagorny-Karabakh and Abkhazia still stand as principal obstacles to political stability and economic development. The Security Council has the adopted immediate withdrawal of all the Azerbaijani territories, with which Armenia has not complied. resolutions urging from troops four Being an active member of the Minsk Group, Turkey is working for a peaceful resolution of the Nagorny-Karabakh conflict within the framework of the OSCE. We initiated a tripartite meeting among the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Turkey in May. The Abkhazian conflict still endangers peace and stability in Georgia and in the entire region. From the outset, Turkey has supported the peaceful resolution of the conflict within the framework of the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Georgia. radical religious movements, In addition to the challenges of building national structures and of achieving economic growth, the young States of Central Asia have faced a set of new threats: terrorist activities, drugs and weapons trafficking. After the tragedy of 11 September, the international community finally acknowledged the importance of stability in the region and of the need to support reform efforts. Transition to full democracy in Central Asia should be seen as a process to be completed gradually as nation- building, political stability and economic conditions are enhanced. 28 is The United Nations the realization of global expectations. We know that its future rests to a great extent on its responsiveness to the crisis of development in societies which have fallen behind. the vehicle for As things stand, the process of globalization, the dominant force of our time, has amply shown its inherent weaknesses, which are apt to create profound issues of imbalance and inequality. A case can be made in favour of globalization(cid:146)s ability to raise the level of prosperity, to reduce poverty and to enhance liberties. However, the fears of the masses cannot be completely allayed without responsive evidence management of that process. Conflict, poverty, discrimination and injustice still blight the lives of millions in every part of the globe. More than 80 countries now have per capita incomes lower than those of a decade or more ago. Poverty is an offence to the conscience of the modern world. of more In view of all those considerations, Africa has a special and urgent claim to global engagement and concern. My country supports efforts aimed at alleviating problems that afflict that continent. At this gathering, I wish to salute the birth of the African Union. We hope that Africans will thus be able to work more effectively to attain their goals. the achievement of In the same vein, Turkey has attributed great importance to the goals and principles adopted initially at the 1992 Rio Conference on Environment and Development and compiled under Agenda 21. They have been our guidelines in combating poverty and the global environment throughout the last decade, which has brought us to the World Summit on Sustainable Development, recently held in Johannesburg. in protecting Before I conclude, I wish to underline one very important aspect of our foreign policy. Fifty years after the cornerstone was laid, the integration of Europe is gaining further momentum. The dynamic of European Union enlargement is opening up new horizons. The recognition of Turkey as a candidate for accession to the European Union has ushered in a new era in relations between Turkey and the European Union. Turkey is determined to be part of the historic process of unifying Europe. The past decade has presented us with many threats to security. Each has created its own challenge. But one fundamental lesson can be drawn from them all: no single State or organization is able to meet those modern challenges on its own. We need to work together closely. The United Nations is the very forum in which we can achieve international cooperation and harmonization to meet those challenges. As always, Turkey stands ready to do its utmost to contribute to the realization of its noble goals. "}}
