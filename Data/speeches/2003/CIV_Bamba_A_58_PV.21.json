{"speech":{"0":" I have the great honour of conveying to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session the greetings of the people of Cote dIvoire, President Laurent Gbagbo, Prime Minister Seydou Elimane Diarra and the Government. The delegation of Cote dIvoire has the pleasure of warmly congratulating the President of the General Assembly on his election. We wish him every success as he carries out the lofty and important tasks entrusted to him by the Member States of the Organization. His election is a testament to the international communitys recognition of the vibrancy and diplomacy of Saint Lucia — the Presidents very beautiful country — in working for the ideals of the United Nations. His election is also a tribute to his skills as a diplomat, and an illustration of the fact that all countries are treated equally at the United Nations, which I welcome and I assure the cooperation of my delegation. the President of I am also pleased to convey the gratitude of the delegation of Cote dIvoire to Mr. Jan Kavan, President of the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session, for the skill and mastery with which he guided the Assemblys work. 20 I take this opportunity to once again express to the Secretary-General, the United Nations and the bereaved families the sincere condolences of the people of Cote dIvoire on the tragic death of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, the Secretary-Generals Special Representative for Iraq, other United Nations staff members and all other persons killed or wounded in the fight for peace and justice. I also take this opportunity to reaffirm the appreciation of the people and Government of Cote dIvoire for the work of Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who works tirelessly for peace in the world and in Africa and who makes every effort to lend his personal support, as well as that of the Organization, to the restoration of peace in Cote dIvoire. that led to that enjoyed Cote dIvoire was once a model of stability and a haven of peace relative economic prosperity. However, for almost a decade it experienced a hidden crisis the coup detat of 24 December 1999, followed on 19 September 2002 by another attempted coup detat that quickly became an armed rebellion. It was backed by foreign elements whose aim was republican institutions and elected Government. That crisis did enormous harm to the population of Cote dIvoire and to all who had chosen to live in our country and to freely carry out their activities there. to undermine our the democratically A round table, held upon the initiative of France, brought together the various political forces of Cote dIvoire, leading to what is now known as the Linas- Marcoussis Agreement. The Agreement — to which the United Nations gave international recognition through Security Council resolution 1464 (2003), after it had been endorsed by heads of State and leaders of international institutions meeting at the Kleber conference centre in Paris — provides for, among other things, the establishment of a Government of national reconciliation headed by a consensus Prime Minister with the necessary executive powers to implement the Agreement. formal The Government of National Reconciliation, established on 13 March 2003, has made significant progress, including the 3 May 2003 signing of a comprehensive ceasefire agreement between the Forces armees nationales de Cote dIvoire (FANCI) and the Forces nouvelles — the former armed rebellion; the establishment of a consensus national disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme; the normalization of relations between Cote dIvoire and its neighbours, including the reopening of rail service from Abidjan to Ouagadougou; the 4 July 2003 joint declaration by the two parties of an end to hostilities; and, above all, the passing of an amnesty law on 6 August 2003. It should be pointed out that that law does not provide amnesty for common crimes and offences, including crimes related to violations of human rights, which must be investigated. it financial support the severe crisis With regard to human rights, Cote dIvoire, despite is experiencing, has constantly placed respect for the human person at the centre of its concerns. In addition, despite its meagre financial capacity, it has been tireless in pursuing its original policy of welcoming refugees, whose numbers have increased due to the crisis in neighbouring Liberia. the international community is needed to share that heavy burden. My country must simultaneously guarantee the repatriation of the many Ivorian refugees in a number of neighbouring countries. Increased from Here, I am pleased to mention that Cote dIvoire has ratified all instruments relative to the protection and promotion of human rights and, on 5 August 2002 — even before the crisis had occurred — created a Ministry devoted exclusively to human rights. Moreover, in view of massive human rights violations, Cote dIvoire formally requested on 5 November 2002 that an impartial United Nations fact-finding mission be sent to verify such violations throughout its territory in order to combat impunity. the request of the President of Thus, after having at the same time consulted the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights — whose first high-level fact-finding mission had already visited Cote dIvoire in April 2003, following the United Nations mission dispatched by the Secretary- General at the Republic — Cote dIvoire, in order to demonstrate its full cooperation with the various mechanisms of the Commission on Human and Peoples Rights, hastened to ensure positive follow-up with proposed dates for visits by the following: the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Secretary-General on Internally Displaced Persons and by the Special Rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights on Contemporary Forms of Racism and Racial Discrimination; on Xenophobia and Related Intolerance; on the Right to the Human Rights of Freedom of Opinion; on Migrants; and, recently, on the Use of Mercenaries. The fact that it is temporarily impossible for our Administration and for the Special Rapporteurs to travel throughout the territory to verify the facts — together with the cries of distress of the people in those areas — is a challenge to the international community. I must commend the international communitys firm commitment and immense efforts to extricate Cote dIvoire from this crisis. Coming back to the progress achieved on the path to peace, I am pleased to note the 12 September 2003 appointment, after long and difficult negotiations, of the Ministers of Defence and of Security, which paves the way for implementation of the national programme of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) established by the Government of National Reconciliation. To that end, a disarmament committee and another committee responsible for reunification have been established. In those ways, the Government intends to show its resolve to work for a return to peace. However, despite such encouraging results, we must acknowledge that the path of peace is fraught with pitfalls. The current difficulties prove that the process of peace and national reconciliation remains fragile. Still, the inter-Ivorian dialogue is continuing, and all of the Linas- Marcoussis Agreement is the only solution providing a way out of the Ivorian crisis. the forces recognize that In that connection, Cote dIvoire welcomes the firm commitment of the United States to Liberia in supporting the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to help that fraternal country exorcise the demons of war and division. In Cote dIvoire, as in Liberia, the DDR programme remains of paramount importance to that end. Indeed, the Government attaches particular importance to the DDR programme, which, by re-establishing security and restoring territorial integrity, will enable Cote dIvoire to organize transparent and fair elections in 2005, under international supervision. On behalf of the Ivorian Government, I should like to take advantage of this rostrum once again to thank the international community — particularly the heads of State of the ECOWAS countries and the President and the Government of France — for its unwavering support for the peace effort in Cote dIvoire. 21 Cote dIvoire remains concerned about the international situation and the problems afflicting it, including the current pandemics of HIAIDS, malaria and tuberculosis; armed conflicts; disarmament; terrorism; and comprehensive human development. Indeed, we note that, although HIAIDS affects 20 million people in Africa — two thirds of those infected worldwide — malaria continues to have at least an equal effect on the continents mortality rate. To make matters even worse, tuberculosis is showing signs of a disturbing resurgence. The establishment of the United Nations Global Fund to fight these three pandemics — amounting to $10.4 million — therefore provides genuine grounds for encouragement and hope for affected populations, particularly in countries of the third world. However, we hope that the Funds endowment will increase and that it will swiftly become operational and more easily accessible to countries that are already hard hit by these scourges and that — ironically enough — are also the chief theatres of armed conflicts. It is paradoxical to note that such conflicts are increasing in number, frequency and intensity — particularly in Africa — even as the modes and modalities for their management by the United Nations and by regional and subregional organizations are being strengthened, diversified and improved. Cote dIvoire therefore congratulates the Organization and its dedicated Secretary-General, as well as regional countries and organizations, on the results already achieved in Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau, Cote dIvoire, Liberia and the Great Lakes region, to cite just the most recent cases. Those results encourage all the parties concerned to persevere in the effort to re- establish and consolidate peace in all these war-torn areas. in Iraq and Concerning the situations in Afghanistan, my country hopes for a swift return to peace and security so that their respective peoples — who have suffered much over the past decade — will be able to devote their efforts to economic and social progress. In the Middle East, Cote dIvoire appeals for moderation on both sides and for compliance with the road map, which is the way back to peace in that part of the world. In any event, law must always prevail over violence, and dialogue — under the aegis of the 22 international community — must always be favoured tool for resolving disputes. the and in our Conflicts are the work of, inter alia, armed gangs, the unemployed, the marginalized and deserters who feed the flourishing market for mercenaries in Africa in general in particular. Mercenarism, together with the proliferation of and illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, is a dangerous threat to the peace and stability of our countries. Those scourges — along with terrorism, which sadly continues to claim its victims — demand special attention from the international community. subregion The Assembly must undertake concrete measures in the fight against these destabilizing factors in the world, particularly in Africa. The implementation of the Programme of Action of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects — whose review last July revealed an increasing universal awareness of the danger of proliferation and the need to take coordinated actions to control it — will be an important step forward if we have the necessary political will. The measures undertaken at the regional and subregional levels — particularly the ECOWAS Moratorium and the assistance provided by for Coordination and Assistance for Security and Development in Africa and by other entities — are elements leading in the right direction. the Programme Likewise, the Assembly should activate and give fresh impetus to regional and international convention and encourage the standardization of legislation to effectively fight the phenomenon of mercenarism. Cote dIvoire endorses the proposal to draw up and establish — within the framework of ECOWAS — a general plan for stabilization in the subregion, which, I am convinced, would contribute to a return to lasting peace and stability in West Africa. community to preventive diplomacy, because Preventive action must also be taken at several levels. At the political and diplomatic level, the international should devote greater attention is essential that the outbreak of conflict be prevented through an early-warning system. At the economic and social the fight against poverty must be continued, particularly by integrating the unemployed and other marginalized people economic structures. level, it into At the cultural level, education for peace, expanding sporting and cultural exchanges, meetings among groups of women and young people, at the level of each State and among the various countries, can promote tolerance and mutual understanding among peoples in the context of a dialogue among civilizations. The globalization of the economy may be a factor for progress by favouring competitiveness, bringing to the market the best products at the most competitive prices. Sadly, such globalization could also impede the development of poor countries, which suffer from fluctuations in the price of their products on the international market and, moreover, must cope with unfair competition imposed by States that subsidize their export items. to gauge the magnitude of Given these mixed results, the recent Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization in Cancun helped the ruinous consequences for African farmers of the subsidies given to producers in the North. By breaking the rules of free competition, the industrialized countries have enabled thrive while impoverishing those that are struggling for survival. This dire situation should cause us to examine our conscience so that together we may seek ways and means to redress this injustice. richest producers the to There is also an urgent need to take action to stabilize commodity prices at a profitable rate. If poor countries are to escape the vicious circle of poverty, there must be fair remuneration for the work of their farmers, complemented by an increase in official development assistance, which should reach 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of industrialized countries, and by debt cancellation. Let us take the opportunity of the present session to reflect together on ways to strengthen North-South cooperation in the framework of the New Partnership for Africas Development. In the framework of South- South cooperation, the most advanced countries should plan to increase trade and technology transfers to benefit less advantaged countries, in support of their own efforts. We are concerned about the coordinated follow- up to international conferences held under United Nations auspices. The fight against poverty cannot be won unless the the outcome of the major recommendations adopted in the framework of those summits are implemented. It is no good expanding the forums for discussion if the conclusions concerning financing for development or technology transfer, in particular, cannot be implemented and used on the ground in a new spirit of genuine solidarity. My country, Cote dIvoire, fervently wishes to see the advent of the new spirit of solidarity called for by globalization and the interdependence of our States, and also supports reform of the United Nations to make it democratic and efficient. May we all have the wisdom to ensure that our resources and intelligence are put to the service of the building of a better world, where peace, solidarity and justice reign — a world that reflects the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations.
