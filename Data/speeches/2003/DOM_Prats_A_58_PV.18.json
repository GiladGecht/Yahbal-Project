The great transformations that humanity experienced during the course of the previous decade, as well as current challenges, demand greater responsibility on the part of our nations in playing an active role in the search for urgent solutions to the problems that are affecting us. This new session of the General Assembly presents us with an excellent opportunity to achieve that goal.

On the contrary, some member states maintain that this impasse may even be necessary to shape more equitable international agreements at the heart of the WTO. What is an important issue is not to lose the development perspective within the work programme of the WTO, as set in the Doha Development Agenda, because that agenda includes the aspirations of millions of people around the world, whose hope for progress lies in the opportunities of the global economy.
