{"speech":{"0":" The past two years have been years of near apocalyptic ordeal for the world and this great Organization. In rapid succession, the world and this Organization have been caught in what can only be described as a crossfire of terrorism, violence and wars. The uncertainties resulting from these situations are yet to be dispelled. Much of the world is still in the dark, groping for a glimpse of what the future direction of international relations and this Organization will be. The recent unwarranted attacks against the United Nations headquarters and personnel in Baghdad, Iraq, should be roundly condemned. They should not break the will of this Organization to continue to provide humanitarian assistance and relief to the people of Iraq. We in Ghana still believe in the United Nations as the global repository of humankinds aspiration. We believe that the problems of the twenty-first century cannot be addressed without universal commitment to multilateralism spearheaded by the United Nations. We recommend, however, that fairness, firmness, humanity and a sense of balance must characterize United Nations responses to all events of a similar nature, irrespective of where such events occur, this Organization is to enhance its credibility and ensure its relevance in a sustained manner. if importance of multilateral efforts Living in the West African subregion, which has experienced more than its fair share of conflicts, my countrymen are familiar with the negative effects of conflicts, and the pain of insecurity. They also know the in conflict management. Hence, for more than 40 years, Ghana has demonstrated commitment to international conflict prevention and resolution and peacekeeping missions around the world, under the auspices of the United Nations, and now the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The latest is the countrys participation Force (ECOFORCE), in Cote dIvoire and Liberia. the ECOWAS Peace in Africa accepts its responsibility for resolving the continents internal conflicts. Today, there is no doubt that the nations of Africa are rising to this challenge. But there is also no doubt that the continent suffers massive shortcomings in financing and technological resources. This is why the international community, especially its Charter obligations, must continue to support Africa in its efforts to maintain peace. It is therefore hoped that Security Council consideration of Africas conflicts the United Nations, under 10 will yield adequate, practical and timely support to resolve them. as as well this help, the Community In my current capacity as Chairman of ECOWAS, I wish to acknowledge the valuable support of the various Governments international organizations, which have contributed to the efforts of the Community to achieve peace and stabilize the subregion. With is succeeding in resolving conflicts that have engulfed Cote dIvoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone and other nations. All of them are now, thankfully, on the way to stability and normality. I therefore seize this opportunity to express the appreciation of the Community and myself to France, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, as well as the European Union and the United Nations, under the leadership of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to name just a few of those who have provided substantial assistance. While ECOWAS fully appreciates the support of our friends, it must nevertheless appeal for some more resources from this Organization and the international community to enable it to consolidate the peace and normalization process. It might be necessary to stress that, in some instances within the subregion, post- conflict peace-building efforts have failed, mainly because the problems involved were not addressed in a systematic, sustained and holistic manner. In the main, such disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of combatants into regular society. ECOWAS therefore appeals for the assistance needed for their effective management. problems include the the subregion. In this regard, we note Yet another serious continuing menace is the prevalent illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in the commendable progress made by international community in addressing this menace through the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons. The truth, however, is that more vigorous and resourceful effort is needed to succeed. the The Human Development Report 2003 exposes the tragedy that besets sub-Saharan Africa, and this is the most suitable platform to highlight it. The report states that the rest of the world has left sub-Saharan Africa behind, and that it will take 150 years for our region to achieve the Millennium Development Goals that Member States of this Organization had hoped to achieve by 2015. The report indicates that: “Unless things improve, it would take sub-Saharan Africa until 2129 to achieve universal primary education, until 2147” — more than a century later than hoped — “to halve extreme poverty, and until 2165 to cut child mortality by two thirds. For hunger, no date can be set because the regions situation continues to worsen.” This is the century of the global village. How can sub-Saharan Africa, with more than 400 million people, be condemned to such a fate? Clearly, this must not be acceptable for the globalization process. This is why the international community, particularly the industrialized nations, should appreciate the urgency of the situation and offer commensurate partnership and assistance to the African Union and its initiative, the New Partnership for Africas Development (NEPAD), to relaunch the continents development. The current leadership of the continent has resolved to nurture Africa back to prosperity within the framework of the NEPAD. Good governance — characterized by democratic constitutional rule; the rule of law; respect for human rights and property rights; accountable government and its recognition and intercourse with civil organizations; freedom of expression; religious tolerance; eradication of illiteracy; and promotion of gender balance and childrens rights — is fast becoming the order of the day throughout Africa. Indeed, good governance is an article of faith of the African Union today. private-sector promotion; Economically, the African Union is calling for partnerships, both within and outside the continent, to pool capital, technological and managerial ideas, and also markets, the development of Africa into the mainstream of the global market. to promote and track fast At this stage, may I be permitted to express some reservations on the topical issue of world trade? It must be recognized that even as globalization is engulfing all the corners of the world, in such a manner that no part can opt out, free trade and competition, which are the hallmarks of the global market, can prove inimical and disastrous to most nations, particularly the developing and least developed countries. This will be so unless the process of globalization is properly and sensitively managed. The reality of the situation is that most of the least developed countries are in Africa, especially sub- Saharan Africa. At the current stage of development, most of Africa is limited to exporting raw minerals and agricultural commodities. This means that unless the developed parts of the world remove subsidies for their agricultural and mineral sectors, Africa cannot be competitive. Indeed, Africas equivalent sectors may be destroyed with dumping from the advanced parts of the world. It is also being seriously suggested that, even as the World Trade Organization (WTO) recognizes that Africa must be accorded a status of transition, or a special status for a carefully calculated period, the WTO does not seem to be propagating this necessity enough to give practical effect to it. The failure of Cancun bears witness this. The World Trade Organization must, therefore, do its homework well to carry the poor nations with it. A combination of trade and aid must be used to assist the African Union and its component nations and to nurture their economies into competitive resourcefulness. This to empower Africa and get it into the mainstream of the world market, without adding to the hardships of the already marginalized people of the continent. the way to is This being a session devoted to the consideration of the biennial budget for 2004-2005, we hope that all Member States will work together positively to ensure that adequate funding is provided for all prioritized mandates for implementation, including those for the development and stability of Africa. In this regard, we welcome the recent establishment of the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa to the Secretary-General, and look forward to the positive contribution which the Office will make to meet the numerous challenges on the continent. My delegation is happy with the Secretary- Generals renewed efforts to reform aspects of this Organizations operations and appreciates his challenge to Member States to make a bold effort towards this end. In this regard, we assure him of our full support during this session for the adoption and implementation of his renewed vision, and we endorse his report entitled “Strengthening the United Nations: an agenda for further change” ( and Corr.1). it carries out We also wish to reiterate the imperative need for the Security Council to be reformed, in order to ensure that its Charter obligations more effectively in the full confidence of Member States. In this regard, we subscribe wholly to the Non-Aligned Movements position on the question of an increase in the membership of the Security Council. We also 11 endorse Africas claim to have at least two permanent seats. relations. I am also certain that you are an excellent successor to an excellent predecessor. We sincerely hope that the Organization will be empowered to assume a central role in the current efforts to normalize the situation in the Middle East, especially in Iraq and Palestine. The strengthening of the Organization leadership will reinvigorate it to survive this century and promote the cause of peace and security in the world. to provide this Let me conclude by thanking your predecessor for having ably guided the deliberations of the General Assembly through what was by all accounts a particularly difficult year. We are also happy to see you in the Presidency. We are confident that the General Assembly could not be in more competent hands and we wish you well. I thank you and may God bless us all. "}}
