{"speech":{"0":" You have assumed the presidency of the General We need urgent and consistent action, too, designed to extinguish hotbeds of tension, resolve 22 conflicts and restore peace wherever it is threatened. We need thoughtful, participatory and realistic action designed to improve the functioning of the United Nations system by introducing the necessary structural reforms and more democratic, transparent and rational practices in the Security Council, in particular, and here in the General Assembly as well. We need equitable and united action to redress inequality in trade, which was recently denounced at the World Trade Organization Conference in Cancun, and to advance socio-economic development in the most disadvantaged countries. Each of us is aware of the daunting nature of the intricate task facing us. All these objectives and many others require of us the steadfast will to harmonize our points of view while keeping in mind the crux of the matter — our shared responsibility to work together in the interests of all Member States. This collective endeavour can and must succeed, without, however, obliging us to renounce our principles or ignore those rules, the relevance and utility of which we are well aware. To that end, we have a unique and irreplaceable framework — the United Nations, the sole truly global forum. this Assembly. Thus, To be sure, our Organization is far from perfect, but how could it be otherwise in a world as complex and unequal as ours? Moreover, we are the United Nations, as was so well recalled by the Secretary- General before is not unreasonable to believe that, if we agree and if we so decide, our Organization could be restructured and better adapted to the rapid transformations we are witnessing and, in response to the hopes of all, more capable of meeting the growing challenges. The necessary reforms are possible so long as Member States have the genuine and unflagging political will to implement them. it We have undeniably been sorely tried and tested this year. The tragic events of 19 August are still vivid in our memories, along with the bitterly painful memories of our late colleagues and friends, who were killed in a cowardly manner and cruelly wrested from their families. We will never be able fully to express our debt to Sergio and all the others who lost their lives in the service of the United Nations and the noble goals and ideals that we champion and shall continue to champion together. We must emerge from this ordeal more resolute and more united. Circumstances require no less and we are ethically compelled to do so. to congratulate I wish here and now the Secretary-General on his leadership and dedication to the cause of peace and to hail the dignity, compassion and humanism that he demonstrated in the face of such a tragic ordeal as the brutal, wrongful and unforeseen deaths of colleagues and personal friends. The United Nations, for the first time in a long while, has been bypassed — indeed, forced to take a back seat — in the management of a crisis, the nature and gravity of which required it to play its due role therein. Beyond the differences that emerged within the international community, and in particular among the members of the Security Council, regarding the right way to deal with an outlaw, recidivist and dangerous regime, the issue of Iraq once again highlighted the limitations of an Organization that, while universal, nevertheless depends on a small number of its Members. That is one of the reasons behind the many frustrations voiced year after year from this rostrum. and endemic malnutrition Our continent, Africa, still faces difficulties of all kinds. Poverty are compounded by the agonies of HIAIDS, which continues to kill millions of individuals. There is also the growing number of conflicts and the proliferation of small arms, which pose an ongoing threat to the peace and stability of the countries of our continent. This unfortunate picture is particularly accurate for West Africa, where several armed conflicts have erupted in recent years, with Liberia as their epicenter. Everyone is now aware of what some of us, the Republic of Guinea in particular, have been saying for years: The civil war in Liberia is contagious and the trigger of a series of crises and armed conflicts in the subregion. It has now touched countries that were once held up as examples of political stability and economic growth and were believed to be immune to such disasters. like to welcome My delegation should the progress recently made in Liberia. The people of that country deserve finally to live in peace. It is a people that, as we all know, has suffered greatly from many years of war and destruction. We were also totally shocked to see all those children being used as cannon fodder in a war that was unjustified and unjustifiable. We also note with satisfaction the progress made in Sierra Leone. There, too, it was high time for peace to be restored. We are also pleased that our friends in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have finally 23 committed themselves on the path to progress and national reconciliation. My country, Guinea-Bissau, has undergone some changes, the nature of which and the methods used to effect them have been subject to criticism, running the gamut from simple regret to formal condemnation. These are positions of principle that we understand and accept, for we have never ceased to proclaim our devotion to democracy and the rule of law. I recall here that my country was one of the first in Africa to wage an exemplary liberation struggle on behalf of freedom, human rights and democracy. However, the sad realities of life, particularly when they are characterized by chronic and dangerous constitutional instability, can unfortunately lead to the overthrow of an existing regime specifically to prevent the exacerbation of social and political tensions in the country that could lead to confrontation or even civil war. In Guinea-Bissau, a military committee decided to reflect in action the hopes for change of the majority of the population. Not a single shot was fired. No one in Guinea-Bissau has been arrested and I welcome the fact that the military has rejected any consideration of exercising power. In such circumstances, it is hardly this surprising movement, which has effected they desired. Indeed, the peoples support was total. the people have adhered that to the changes The members of the military committee for the restitution of the constitutional and democratic order were in fact acclaimed as genuine liberators. In Guinea-Bissau, we had been in an untenable situation. Our people, whose courage and dignity cannot be overemphasized, had had enough. They had reached the limit of what one can decently ask someone to put up with. I cannot sufficiently reiterate the extent to which our people deserve to be encouraged, supported and assisted. Now that we have decided to turn the page, to look towards the future and to determine how we, the citizens of Guinea-Bissau, can be reconciled, unite our forces, create synergy and act together for the well- being of our people, the international community should intercede on our behalf and to provide the financial assistance we need. It is indeed financial assistance that we need, because our country and our State are destitute. We need international assistance to recover, to meet our challenges and to ensure that our 24 people can eat. We need to see to it that those who chose freedom some 30 years ago can finally see it flourish, enjoy its benefits and understand why they fought and why they have a right to a decent and better life. I should like to say here that, right now in our country, a process is under way that is bringing together all the vital forces of our nation. The political parties, the military committee and civil society — everyone has come together to meet the challenge as one and to answer the call of the people to join forces and work together. As I speak before this Assembly, the membership of the Government is under discussion. Thanks to concerted action and a professional and intensive analysis of the situation in our country, we have been able to adopt an interim charter that specifies all the stages required to restore as soon as possible the constitutional and democratic order that we and the international community wish to see return to Guinea-Bissau. An Interim President has been chosen by consensus. This President is dedicated to working for the unity of the country. He intends to strengthen national unity and to serve as a catalyst so that we can return to our ideal of progress and freedom. In conclusion, I should like to thank our brothers and sisters of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) subregion, who have striven to help us get back on our feet, discuss and find the most appropriate solutions to our problems. I thank first of all the Heads of State of Ghana, Senegal and Nigeria, who have visited Guinea-Bissau, as well as the ECOWAS ministers, who have never failed to support Guinea-Bissau. I also wish to note the assistance provided to us by the Community of Portuguese- Speaking Countries, which dispatched the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Timor-Leste to advise us and to voice the solidarity of that linguistic community, to which we belong. A countrys national unity is its most precious asset. I cannot overemphasize that fact and I hope that I shall soon see democracy fully restored in my country. Above all, however, I wish to see the people of Guinea- Bissau happy. It is a proud and dignified people that has suffered in silence — a most eloquent silence — and that deserves the trust and assistance of the international community. "}}
