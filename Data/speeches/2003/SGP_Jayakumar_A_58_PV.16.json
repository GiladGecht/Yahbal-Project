{"speech":{"0":" I would like to congratulate Mr. Julian Hunte, the Foreign Minister of Saint Lucia, on his election as the new President of the General Assembly. Singapore is delighted that a fellow small island State and member of the Forum of Small States holds that office. I also join others in paying a tribute to United Nations personnel who have fallen victim to violence or attacks, including a special tribute to the late Sergio Vieira de Mello. The terrorist attack that caused his death has outraged the entire civilized world. Sergio dedicated his life, and ultimately gave his life, in the service of the United Nations. He is mourned and missed by his many friends around the world. We can best honour his memory by reaffirming our commitment to the ideals that he served. The run-up to the war in Iraq saw a heated debate about the role of the United Nations. The United Nations is, of course, no stranger to controversy, but that debate was notable for being framed in particularly stark terms. The rhetoric was inflamed and inflated. It has been variously asserted, with glee or gloom, that the United Nations was irrelevant or irreplaceable, a threat to national sovereignty, the sole source of international legitimacy, merely a tool of the remaining super-Power, or the only way to restrain that super- Power. There are indeed serious issues that require debate, but the simplistic manner in which that debate was framed — in particular the portrayal of a struggle between unilateralism and multilateralism — is, in my view, unhelpful. Unfortunately, that rhetoric has obscured, rather than clarified, the issue. It has oversimplified the debate and glossed over the more complex reality. The danger is that we may believe in the rhetoric and arrive at wrong conclusions about the relevance, or irrelevance, of the United Nations. I am therefore joining that debate with some trepidation, and I do so only to highlight some of the complexities, in the hope that it will contribute to a more balanced appraisal of the United Nations. I shall start by restating some basics. indispensable on some crucial In the 58 years since its formation, the influence and role of the United Nations in world affairs has always flowed and ebbed in accordance with shifting geopolitical tides. The role of the United Nations has been international issues; on other occasions the United Nations has had no role, or only a marginal role. If that meant that the United Nations was irrelevant, then it was irrelevant long before the recent war in Iraq. The ability of the United Nations to act and the kinds of actions it took have always been contingent on how States, and in 29 particular the permanent members of the Security Council, perceived whether the United Nations served their interests. But the United Nations and the United Nations system have always endured. Neither the variable fortunes nor the survival of the United Nations should surprise anyone. The United Nations functions in an international system consisting of sovereign States. Multilateralism and unilateralism were never mutually exclusive alternatives; they are different options in every States menu of policy choices. Few States, large or small, would agree to entrust their security or other vital national interests entirely to a multilateral institution. On the other hand, no State, however powerful, can always succeed in achieving its objectives without the help of others. Every State will choose the option that serves its interest best. Furthermore, the United Nations as a total system is bigger than the General Assembly and the Security Council. As we debate the future of international organizations we should not forget that the world has never been more interdependent, and therefore more in need of global governance. The United Nations now has more than 190 Members and has never been closer to the ideal of universal participation. There has never been a period in world history when there have been more international legal regimes and norms regulating State behaviour. The Secretariat is the depository for over 500 international treaties covering the entire spectrum of global activities. legal International regimes and norms are imperfect in their efficiency and observance. Some international norms are hotly contested. Still, the conduct of international relations today does not take place in a vacuum, but within that framework of laws, rules, standards and norms. Nevertheless, there is no escaping the fact that the maintenance of international peace and security is first among the purposes of the United Nations, and the most contested and controversial of its roles. It is also the focus of the current debate over Iraq. It is here that the rhetorical exaggerations I mentioned earlier stand most in the way of clear and rational thinking about the strengths and limitations of the United Nations. Traditional international law recognizes only two grounds for the use of force: self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter and authorization by the Security Council. That seeming clarity is deceptive. 30 the of Even before latest Iraq war, traditional interpretations of the Charter had been questioned. The doctrine of self-defence has long been the subject of learned debate. The current controversy over the right to pre-emption is only the latest manifestation. The doctrine or “responsibility to protect” — so boldly brought to the fore by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, has for several decades challenged the conventional concepts of non- intervention and the sovereign equality of States. intervention — humanitarian Another challenge to traditional approaches has been the threat posed by non-State actors, especially the contemporary menace posed by perpetrators of international terrorism. The problem posed by rebel groups in civil conflicts is another example. In its efforts to respond to egregious violations of human rights, starvation, anarchy and chaos, the Security Council had already stretched both the authority of the United Nations to intervene and the definition of “threats to the peace” and “aggression”. The war in Iraq was not the first time, and will not be the last time, that the Security Council was unable to act. The hope of the late 1980s and early 1990s that the end of the cold war would at last enable the Security Council to discharge its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security has long been shattered. In retrospect, Iraqs invasion and annexation of Kuwait in 1990 represented an unusually clear-cut violation of fundamental Charter principles. That greatly eased the task of securing Security Council authorization for military action. But the consensus on Iraq was short-lived. By 1994, France and Russia began to call for a road map for the lifting of sanctions. By 1998, the withdrawal of the United Nations Special Commission and Operation Desert Fox marked the end of the Security Councils consensus on Iraq. Thereafter the Security Council acted in accordance with a complex balance of principles in inconsistent and incoherent decisions. In the oil-for- the food debates humanitarian concerns about consequences of sanctions were mixed with the commercial and business interests of some of the permanent members. and national interests, resulting That did not, however, make the Security Council irrelevant. It merely meant that the Council served as a forum for managing competing interests, an important role that it has played for all its history. After all, while Security Council resolutions have the force of law, they are, at the end of the day, first and foremost political documents indicating the degree of consensus that can be achieved among its most powerful members at any one time. I do not think that it is self-evident that the 2002- 2003 clash of interests over Iraq was qualitatively different from the differences between the permanent members during the previous decade. I do not think that the disagreement over Iraq has permanently damaged the United Nations. The 2002-2003 crisis over Iraq in the Security Council only underscored what we have known all along, namely, that the Security Council can authorize intervention only when the permanent members are in agreement, and that all States, big and small, will do what they must to protect their vital national interests. This is not the occasion to revisit old debates over whether the war in Iraq was authorized on the basis of a continuity of authority from 1990 to 2003. Certainly, as resolution 1441 (2002) recognized, Iraq had been in material breach of several resolutions. My point is that, whatever its eventual outcome, the intense diplomatic effort to secure another explicit resolution for the use of force was itself testimony to the importance attached by all to the Security Councils legitimizing role. In May, only weeks after a formal end to major combat operations was declared, resolution 1483 (2003) was adopted without any dissenting vote, recognizing that the United Nations had a significant role in post-war Iraq. More balanced views are now beginning to emerge, albeit still tainted by the bitterness of the debates in the run-up to the war. It will be some time before consensus can be reached on the role of the United Nations in post-war Iraq. Some are loath to grant ex post facto legitimization of military action. At the same time, there is reluctance to cede power won with blood. But the legitimacy that the United Nations brings is unique. The debate on the role of the United Nations will continue. It can, and should, go on. But that does not mean that the United Nations should be in paralysis. We must at time press on with our commitment to fulfil the fundamental purposes of the United Nations, which, as stated in the Charter, are “To maintain international peace and security”, “To develop the same friendly relations among nations” and “To achieve international cooperation”. The starting point for that effort must be acceptance of the fact that, while the United Nations stands for ideals that we must never relinquish, the reality is that the United Nations both reflects and shapes geopolitics. Underlying the debates in the run- up to the war, and still infusing the controversies, is acute uneasiness over the distribution of power in the post-cold war international system. But can the United Nations escape that reality? The fact is that the United Nations can operate only on the basis of a hard-headed appreciation of the realities of power. If we allow exaggerated rhetoric about the role of the United Nations to obscure that fact, then we do the United Nations a disservice. The Charter of the United Nations has remained essentially unchanged since 1945. But it has been continuously interpreted and re-interpreted to meet changing new challenges, many of which were unforeseen by the founders of the United Nations. circumstances geopolitical and international Today we are again faced with radically new threats, not least of which are the global terrorist networks that respect neither national boundaries nor traditional the United Nations needs to fashion new and more flexible rules to deal with these new threats. Yet, at the same time, we must continue to ensure that there are adequate safeguards to prevent abuse or a return to the law of the jungle. law. Clearly, Finding the right balance between those equally urgent imperatives will not be easy. But it is not impossible, if we can find the discipline to debate the issues openly clear appreciation of both the limitations and potential of the United Nations. realistically, with and a Recent events in Iraq have shown that the United States needs the United Nations. It is also a fact that the United Nations needs the United States. Since there is a convergence of interests for the two to cooperate in order to achieve our shared interests and objectives, it is surely not impossible for us to negotiate and agree upon a new paradigm of cooperation between the worlds sole super-Power and the worlds only, and indispensable, United Nations. 31 The United Nations is not a panacea for all the worlds ills. Neither is the United Nations a global villain. The United Nations is a political institution. Politics, as is often said, is the art of the possible. There is no need, therefore, to succumb to despair or cynicism. We should turn the page and move on. now The Acting President floor (spoke in Spanish): I to His Excellency Mr. Baboucarr-Blaise Ismaila Jagne, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the Gambia. give the congratulations Mr. Jagne (Gambia): Please allow me to convey my to delegations warmest Mr. Julian Hunte on his election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. I am sure that his vast experience on the international scene will be brought to bear on the work of this session, and help direct it with ease to a successful session promises to be rich in substance, and may also prove to be a watershed in our bid to make the United Nations responsive to the needs of the peoples of the world in the new millennium. I wish to assure the President of my delegations fullest cooperation in the discharge of his onerous responsibilities. conclusion. The fifty-eighth the fifty-seventh In the same vein, let me also congratulate the out- going President, Mr. Jan Kavan, for his laudable efforts during session. The dynamic Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, also deserves commendation for another productive year of service to the Organization, a year that was fraught with difficulties and incredible challenges. Thanks to his leadership, we have, by and large, been able to weather the storm. this opportunity to express once again We were all devastated, however, by the bombing of the offices of the United Nations in Baghdad, which claimed the lives of so many people. May it never recur — please God — but it shows that we must remain united in our resolve to fight terrorism. Let me seize to Mr. Kofi Annan and his staff, as well as to the relatives the of the heartfelt condolences of people of The Gambia. We pay homage to Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and his colleagues, who lost their lives, and we mourn the tragic loss of a highly- acclaimed international civil servant at the hands of terrorists. In wishing the injured a speedy recovery, we pray that the souls of all those who died rest in perfect peace. My delegation strongly urges that that cowardly the victims, 32 act should in no way weaken the resolve of the United Nations in fulfilling its obligations to the people of Iraq. Resolution 1373 (2001) was adopted unanimously by the Security Council following the attacks of 11 September, and the majority of Member States, including my own, have embarked on implementing its salient provisions. We have the major international and, furthermore, have enacted domestic legislation to implement them. Let me state that, in spite of our modest achievements international cooperation and technical assistance remain critical to the success of our future implementation efforts. that regard, instruments terrorism ratified on in The Counter-Terrorism Committees assistance unit must strengthen the coordination of its technical assistance portfolio in order to have greater impact. In that regard, we welcome the commitment of the G-8 to provide capacity-building and technical assistance to priority countries. The translation of declarations of commitment into concrete action is the only guarantee of making meaningful headway to counter terrorism. Apart from the recent terrorist attacks against the United Nations in Baghdad, other such incidents in Indonesia, Kenya, the Russian Federation, Morocco and Saudi Arabia, coming in the wake of the attacks of 11 September, are reminders of the enormity of the tasks ahead. The fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly has been convened at a time when our approaches to the management of global issues have come under sharp scrutiny. Those issues are the unfinished business of the preceding millennium. The United Nations — the premier, overarching venue for multilateralism — cannot but be the only vehicle through which the worlds peace and security problems can be solved. The recent events in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere only serve to underscore the need for the nations of the world to strengthen, not weaken, multilateralism. We shall never achieve global peace, security and prosperity without working together in a forum such as the one provided by the United Nations, a forum that is all-inclusive and which permits each and every nation — big or small, rich or poor — to expound on matters of concern to them. The ideals and principles that were the basis of the founding of the Organization are as relevant today as they were 58 years ago. Let us therefore to the United multilateralism by always our turning commitment demonstrate to Nations. My delegation therefore urges all Member States to maintain confidence in the United Nations and to have recourse to the Organization for the peaceful resolution of conflicts and the settlement of disputes. real threat a While terrorism poses to international peace and security, other violent conflicts continue to rage around the world, leaving death, destruction and desolation in their wake. The situation in the Mano River Union region remains volatile as I speak. Even though former President Charles Taylor of Liberia has left the scene, as was required of him, and there appears to be some laudable progress towards reinvigorating the democratic process in that country, we should be under no illusion as to the extreme fragility of the situation in Liberia, and indeed within the West African subregion. We commend all the parties that recently signed the Peace Agreement in Accra, Ghana, for their determination and patience, and urge them to do all in their power to stay the course. That would also have a salutary effect on the situation in neighbouring Sierra Leone, where we note with satisfaction the consolidation of the peace process. However, the problem of conflicts in West Africa continues to be compounded by the illicit flow of small arms and light weapons, as well as by roving bands of mercenaries. International efforts could serve the region best by developing comprehensive disarmament, demobilization and rehabilitation programmes that target militias and that are region-specific rather than country-specific. We must endeavour to address the issue of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons with greater determination. An arrangement similar to the Kimberley Process in blood diamonds is what is urgently required to effectively stem the illicit flow of small arms and light weapons. My Government strongly supports any measure that would treat as accomplices to war crimes and crimes against humanity illegal brokers who knowingly supply arms and weapons to militias and other insurgents in West Africa. Conflict zones elsewhere in Africa that tell a similar story should also be assisted in that manner. We warmly congratulate our brothers in Sudan on the recent signing of the Naivasha peace accord, which promises to bring the long-drawn fratricidal conflict in that country to an end. Meanwhile, my Government continues to play its part in the search for solutions to the problems of peace the initiatives of and security in Africa. We participate actively within the context of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to contribute to the subregions collective efforts in that area. My Government, under the wise leadership of President Jammeh, has in the past contributed, and will contribute in the future, to subregional efforts to keep the peace in West Africa. We have continuously participated in the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) since its inception. We stand ready to contribute our own modest share to any other United Nations peacekeeping operations designed for the West Africa subregion, as we are doing now under the ECOWAS Military Mission in Liberia (ECOMIL). In that regard, we welcome the adoption of Security Council resolution 1509 (2003), establishing the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). I just made mention of the unfinished business of the preceding millennium. Those are thematic issues of political exclusion, disenfranchisement, economic exclusion and abject poverty. All affect the greater majority of humankind. They also give rise to all the urgent situations that the world is faced with today — situations of conflict and civil strife; in short, of the absence of peace. resolution 2758 A peculiar situation of exclusion was created by General Assembly (XXVI) on 25 October 1971, which relates, through its direct effects, to Taiwan. From 1949 to 1971, the Republic of China (Taiwan) was a bona fide member of the United Nations, recognized by the comity of nations. If the Republic of China (Taiwan) could be a member of the United Nations then, why could it not be a member now? The General Assembly adopted resolution 2758 (XXVI), which addressed only the question of the representation of the Peoples Republic of China at the United Nations and related organizations. It did not decide that Taiwan was, or should be, a part of the Peoples Republic of China. Nor did it confer on the Peoples Republic of China the right to represent the Republic of China (Taiwan) or the 23 million Taiwanese people in the United Nations and related organizations. Resolution 2758 (XXVI) has since been misused to justify the exclusion of Taiwan from the United Nations. That runs counter to the claim by the Government of the Peoples Republic of China that it represents the interests of all Chinese, not to mention those Taiwanese who are in the Republic of China (Taiwan). If we are to comprehensively deal with the 33 problems engendered by exclusion in whatever form it takes, I call on the international community to revisit that issue urgently. into material and My Government appreciates the special attention that Guinea-Bissau has received from the Security Council, especially through the Councils Ad Hoc Working Group on Conflict Prevention and Resolution in Africa. We also commend the remarkable efforts of the Economic and Social Councils Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Guinea-Bissau. As Chairperson of the Group of Friends of Guinea-Bissau, my Government acknowledges the groundswell of support and good will that Guinea-Bissau enjoys from the Organization. that has not yet been adequately Unfortunately, translated forms of that country so assistance, which desperately need. The recent developments in Guinea- Bissau should be seen not so much as a constraint, but rather as an opportunity to re-engage the international community, in partnership with the people of Guinea- Bissau, their problems of governance and development. Now that concerted efforts are being made by all the major actors to agree on transitional arrangements for the preparation of parliamentary and presidential elections in the not-too- distant future, we call on the rest of the international community to stabilize the situation and keep the process on course to a successful outcome. the support necessary the people of resolution of to provide financial the in Problems of security and peace in my part of the world have not in any way diminished our concerns over similar problems elsewhere. The people of Iraq and Afghanistan need urgent international assistance to shore up security, re-establish the rule of law and embark on an effective programme of reconstruction. My Government welcomes the adoption of resolution 1500 (2003), in the hope that the establishment of the Governing Council of Iraq will lead towards a real political transition for the Iraqi people. While a speedy end to the occupation of Iraq is both desirable and urgent, as clearly underscored in resolution 1472 (2003), outstanding issues emanating from Iraqs occupation of Kuwait should be comprehensively dealt with once and for all. We continue to follow closely the situation in the Middle East, and we deplore yet again the recent spate of vicious attacks and counter-attacks between Israelis and Palestinians, thus negating hope for an early settlement within the framework of the road map. Trust 34 stage of to every to attend and confidence-building measures must be reinforced and made the implementation of the road map, if the peace process is to endure. Suicide bombings that target innocent civilians must be stopped. The occupation of Arab lands must come to an end. In reiterating our position on the Arab-Israeli conflict, we call for the creation of an in peace alongside the State of Israel. independent Palestinian State living My Government firmly supports the initiatives being taken to reduce tensions between India and Pakistan, two great friends of The Gambia. We urge them both to reduce the arms build-up on their respective sides of the border and to strive harder to reach a mutually acceptable their differences, in particular with regard to the issue of Kashmir. Similarly, we reiterate our support for a peaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula. solution to Human security is not threatened by conflicts alone. The scourge of HIAIDS continues to be elusive, and now poses a serious threat to the viability of some societies in Africa. The HIAIDS pandemic has slowly evolved from a health and humanitarian issue to a development and security problem. The pandemic has compounded the problems African countries face in the fight against other scourges, such as malaria and tuberculosis. It is gratifying to note however, that the international community is sensitized to that fact and that initiatives such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria have been put in place. Consequently, more money, resources and attention must be given to research and development. Contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria have slackened, and developing countries are paying a colossal price in human and material terms. The initiative of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization equally requires adequate funding. strongly supports The pursuit of justice and the international rule of law have never been as pressing as it is today. My Government International Criminal Court as it embarks on its crucial mandate of delivering justice. We hail its progress so far, and I would like to seize this opportunity to call on all to cooperate with the Court in order that, together all around the world, we can say no to the culture of impunity. the While still on the subject of justice, let me reiterate my Governments view that the sanctions being imposed on Cuba should now be lifted. They are counter-productive anyway. Cuba is a peace-loving member of the international community whose people do not deserve the punishment that has been meted out to them for almost four decades now. Let me now turn to development issues. In Africa, our efforts to achieve sustainable development continue to be seriously undermined by a variety of factors, prominent among which are conflicts, structural weaknesses, natural disasters and disease. For the international system to successfully address those factors of underdevelopment, more serious attention must be paid to the implementation of the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010, and more attention must be focused on the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. We must also give effect to the commitments made at Doha, Monterrey and Johannesburg. There is no shortage of blueprints for development. What is in short supply, and what needs to be urgently mobilized, are resources. So far, there is still a big gap between commitment and action. Africas development partners must make good on their pledges support Africas development. My delegation welcomes the Africa Action Plan of the G-8, the African Growth and Opportunity Act of the United States of America and the “Everything But Arms” initiative of the European Union, all of which commit their sponsors to well-defined forms of support for Africas development. to to There are, however, many barriers the implementation of those initiatives, which are caused by certain protectionist policies pursued by our partners, as well as other policy and structural constraints. The problem of farm subsidies just will not go away. Agricultural economies in our part of the world must be allowed to compete if the global trading system is to function in favour of the eradication of poverty. The debt issue is far from being resolved and the procedures for accessing the benefits of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative (HIPC) are too cumbersome for many poor countries to follow. The only realistic approach to the debt problem as a major impediment it unconditionally for HIPC countries and for low-income countries under stress. to development cancel to is We have just ended at Cancun another attempt at negotiations on world trade. My delegation deeply regrets the failure of the talks, as well as the fact that the developed world could not see eye to eye with the Group of 21 on the issue of subsidies. It is in our collective interest to dismantle global trade barriers and allow markets to expand, for incomes to rise in the developing world and poverty to be reduced. Stronger earning power in the developing world would stimulate world trade in ways that would be most beneficial to rich countries. My delegation calls on all concerned to ensure that we return to the negotiating table as soon as possible, and with greater determination on both sides, to reach a just and fair agreement on all the issues involved. Official development assistance (ODA) still falls short of the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product. We commend the countries whose ODA has risen to that level, in particular Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden. My delegation urges all of Africas development partners to address those issues with sincerity and commitment, with a view to meaningfully assisting in kick-starting the sustainable human development process in African countries. It that to note is gratifying the Human Development Report 2003 is devoted to the Millennium Development Goals. In that way, the fight against poverty is kept high on the international communitys agenda, because we still have a very long way to go. For instance, as stated in the report, “Regionally, at the current pace Sub-Saharan Africa would not reach the Goals for poverty until 2147 and for child mortality until 2165. And for HIAIDS and hunger, trends in the region (Human are heading up — not down.” Development Report 2003, p. 2) It is indeed true that sub-Saharan Africa is being left behind. That state of affairs is alarming and, as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has rightly stated, the Millennium Development Goals will not be realized with a business-as-usual approach. The paradox, in our view, is the fact that, while the means to attain the Goals are available, it would appear that the political will to do so is lacking. Let me again quote from the Human Development Report 2003. 35 to tackle than ever before “Todays world has greater resources and know-how the challenges of infectious disease, low productivity, lack of clean energy and transport and lack of basic services such as clean water, sanitation, schools and health care. The issue is how best to apply these resources and know-how to benefit the poorest people.” (ibid, p. 3) In The Gambia, my Governments focus is on the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. The strategy we have designed to that end is detailed in our poverty reduction strategy paper. In a resource- strapped economy such as The Gambias, getting all the relevant indicators to perform well towards poverty reduction is a daunting challenge. It is, however, a challenge my Government is prepared to take up. Our special focus is on the empowerment of our people, and we seek to do so by giving priority to our education, health and agricultural sectors, as well as by building capacity among our women, who are the architects of stable and strong nations. That strategy has so far yielded dividends, as evidenced by my countrys showing on UNDPs Human Development Report 2003. In the education sector our goal is to achieve full enrolment well before the Millennium Declarations target year of 2015. As of now, we have taken the gross enrolment rate from 44 per cent, eight years ago, to over 90 per cent today. We have, at the same time, increased non-formal, adult and distance education programmes throughout the country. The net result has been a dramatic drop illiteracy nationwide. Transition rates from primary to secondary levels have been significantly improved, from 12 per cent, 15 years ago, to over 77 per cent today. Six years ago there were hardly any tertiary level institutions to speak of. Today they abound, and include the new University of The Gambia. That has been made possible by the visionary leadership provided by Al Hadji Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh, President of the Republic of Gambia. in Recognizing the important role women play in the family, in the community and in the nation, my Government has sought to pay special attention to the empowerment of our women through education, training and special income-generating projects. In order to increase opportunities for the girl child in the educational system, we have created a trust fund, entitled “The Presidents Empowerment of Girls Education Project”, to provide full scholarships to girls 36 who would otherwise not be able to go to school for lack of resources. That and other measures geared towards assisting women have helped to close the gender gap in education in Gambia. Empowering the rural dweller is another priority of my Government. We seek to do so through measures that lead to an increase in access to resources, infrastructure and services, as well as to knowledge and skills. Most villages now have a primary school, and clusters of villages share secondary education facilities. and comprehensive Our efforts have also been geared towards the improvement of the health of our people. Significantly improved child health care, especially through an extensive immunization programme, has contributed immensely towards a considerable reduction in infant mortality in the last few years. Infant mortality rates have been reduced by one third. Primary health care programmes have been strengthened across the board. Overall, access to health facilities and services have equally been greatly improved, with the construction of hospitals, health centres, clinics and dispensaries the country. throughout For all these achievements, however, we are humbled by the challenges that still remain. The prevalence of diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and a host of respiratory illnesses, is part of an unfinished agenda. Malaria, in particular, remains a major problem. It is the leading cause of mortality and a major cause of morbidity among pregnant women, contributing to anaemia and low birth weight. Today, with the cooperation of a Cuban medical and health team, The Gambia is number one in Africa as far as its malaria control programme is concerned, according to the World Health Organization. In the area of agriculture, our objective is to achieve a total transformation of the sector. Our priority is to reduce the drudgery of production and increase productivity through a systematic programme of mechanization. Added to this is our bid to reduce our dependence on rain-fed methods of production, in favour of greater irrigation, using the abundant water resources that the Gambia River and its tributaries provide. A third plank of our programme of empowerment in the agriculture sector is to diversify activities away from the traditional crops by placing greater emphasis on food production as well as on other non-traditional crops for export. Finally, with all of these objectives already well on the road to success, we are beginning to increase market access, both locally and abroad, for our producers. Attaining the Millennium Development Goals will depend to a large extent on how well poor countries perform in the areas I have just referred to. It would also depend on how far they themselves are empowered, and made capable of performing, through the requisite support measures from the international community. The United Nations system as a whole can be mobilized further to broker such support for poor countries, and especially for those among them that show promise and positive signs of progress. intent is forms that end, our My Government has been increasing its efforts to deepen democracy and strengthening good governance in The Gambia. To to continuously bring improvements to the performance of all arms of government. Our multiparty democratic system the backbone of our political dispensation. We continue to conduct free and fair elections at all levels of popular representation. Our courts operate independently. We have encouraged the mass media to grow and expand, with increasingly higher levels of private participation. The international community must have been satisfied with our efforts and achievements in this domain, since the World Economic Forum, meeting in South Africa, decided to classify The Gambia its performance on good governance. We are indeed honoured by this recognition, and feel encouraged in our resolve to do even better. in Africa, third for Advances in information and communication technology have come to make our world a truly global village. This is indeed remarkable. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that even in this area there is a great deal of catching up to be done by the developing world. Global initiatives geared towards bridging the digital divide between the developed and developing worlds should be pursued with unrelenting vigour. Scientific and technological research must be conducted in support of the essence of life. In the course of this year, we have heard several claims as to the successful cloning of human embryos. These claims, whether genuine or not, are indeed a wake-up call for all of humanity. The international community must close ranks to address them in a manner that ensures that no one is allowed, for whatever reason, to tinker with science and technology in ways that may upset or threaten natures fragile balance. and The phenomenon of illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing remains a challenge to coastal African States such as The Gambia. It has generated enormous concern at the international level, as is evident from the adoption of various international instruments to combat it. My delegation would like to express its gratitude to the Governments of Japan and Luxembourg and Agriculture Organization for the assistance that they provide to our fisheries sector, and to fully endorse the Secretary- Generals recommendation that technical and financial assistance to developing countries for the conservation and management of fisheries resources should be provided in a comprehensive manner. We call for greater assistance and cooperation in our efforts to promote sustainable practices in the fisheries sector of our economies. the Food the efforts aimed at On the crucial topic of United Nations reform, my delegation welcomes the revitalization of the General Assembly and the reform of the Security Council. After more than a decade, little progress has been made in our attempts to reform the Security Council so that it is truly reflective of the realities of the international system in the twenty-first century. My Government reiterates its stance — indeed the stance of the entire African region — that the to be composition of revamped and democratized. Membership of the Council must be expanded, with Africa occupying at least two permanent seats and five non-permanent seats. We therefore wholeheartedly support the timely proposal of the Secretary-General to establish a high- level panel of eminent personalities to make concrete recommendations, inter alia, on the reforms of the Organization. the Security Council has As we move into the business of the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly, my delegation prays that the Almighty Allah crowns our endeavours with success. We pray that this session proves to be the turning point in our efforts to render the United Nations more relevant, more effective and truly all- inclusive.
