{"speech":{"0":" In the early morning of 11 September 2003, our Foreign Minister Anna Lindh died, murdered in a senseless crime. One of Swedens most prominent and respected leaders is gone. We have lost a part of our future. She spoke for the oppressed, for the victims of human rights violations. She worked for international peace and justice and for multilateral cooperation. The voice of Anna Lindh has been silenced, but her burning conviction echoes with us. We meet at a time when the United Nations is facing difficulties and doubts. The capability of the United Nations has often been in question. Despite crises and shortcomings, the United Nations has always withstood tests. The United Nations was indispensable in 1945 and it still is. these Global security cannot be achieved by unilateral action. Locking ourselves in will not bring peace, development, democracy or respect for human rights. We must work together to define and address emerging challenges for multilateral solutions. The Secretary-General recently said: 32 “We can no longer take it for granted that our multilateral institutions are strong enough to cope with all them”. (, para. 4) the challenges facing the Member States, must adapt. Reform I welcome Kofi Annans challenge to us. The Nordic countries stand behind him. The United Nations and we, is necessary to stay modern, responsive and efficient and to retain the trust of global civil society. International solidarity must be in focus when redefining our common agenda. Attaining the goals of the Millennium Declaration is a shared responsibility. The legitimacy and authority of the Security Council must be regained. Its composition must better reflect the world of today. I believe that an agreement on enlargement with a number of non-permanent members could be reached fairly quickly, without excluding the possibility of additional permanent members at a later stage. We welcome the Secretary-Generals intention of establishing a high-level panel to consider threats to our security and the institutional reforms required for the United Nations to respond. North Korea has withdrawn from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and remains unclear about its intentions. The nuclear programme in Iran, the possession of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan, and Israels refusal to sign the NPT continue to cause concern. In several countries, nuclear weapons are accorded a growing importance in military doctrines. Discussions in the United States about the creation of a new generation of smaller nuclear arms are worrying to us. Such weapons would not contribute to a safer world, but risk lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. The threats from weapons of mass destruction can only be met by multilateral efforts. The negative arms spiral must be reversed. The non-proliferation Treaty must be universally complied with. Sweden continues to work for this goal, together with its partners in the New Agenda Coalition. We need new ideas on disarmament and non- to strengthen existing proliferation and on how regimes. To initiated an independent, international commission chaired by Mr. Hans Blix. Last June, the General Assembly adopted a forward-looking resolution on the prevention of armed this aim, Sweden has conflict. Sweden will continue for a strengthening of the capacity of the United Nations practical preventive work. to work Our focus must be the security of the individual. Violations of human rights can never be accepted. State sovereignty also implies responsibility. If Governments fail to protect their people, the international community must be prepared to act. In its report The Responsibility to Protect, on Intervention and State Sovereignty points out important issues for the international community to take on. How can we make sure that sovereignty and independence never become a license to abuse people? How should the international community live up to its responsibility when States fail to protect their people? International Commission the intrusive in character and need We must make full use of instruments available to avoid war. The Security Council must be ready to act on early warning signals on threats of mass violations of human rights. Mechanisms to prevent such situations may be to be strengthened based on accountability and international law. As the Secretary-General said in his speech on Tuesday, to discuss the best way to respond to threats of genocide or other comparable massive violations of human rights. Prevention of genocide will be the topic for the Stockholm International Forum to be held in my country in January. the Security Council needs seriously There must be an end impunity. The International Criminal Court is now operational. The Court will act as a deterrent to perpetrators and a universal and equal tool for justice. to joint efforts a threat to us men. The absence of these rights is a threat to the progress of mankind. Peace operations require to be successful. The cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations, such as the recent experience in the Democratic Republic of Congo — President Kabilas discussion of which the other day we listened to very carefully — the European Union- led police mission in the Western Balkans and the military operation in Macedonia, are all examples of this. We will continue developing the cooperation between the United Nations and the European Union and welcome the political declaration on crisis management. Many painful lessons can be drawn from the violent conflicts in West Africa. Sweden welcomes the large and broadly based United Nations peacekeeping Mission in Liberia. The international community must support the Economic Community of West African States in finding sustainable solutions for the entire region. The European Union is trying to strengthen such a partnership through the work of Hans Dahlgren, its Special Representative to the Mano River Union countries. the United Nations and Women are crucial to peace and reconciliation. I welcome the fact that gender perspectives are now being incorporated into mandates and activities of all peacekeeping missions. The number of women in peace operations increase. The implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and the strengthening of the United Nations capacity in this field are vital. should levels at all Two years ago, Foreign Minister Anna Lindh was accompanied to the General Assembly by her then 11- year-old son David. When he entered the Hall, he asked: “Mom, where are all the women?” He saw what many of us seem blind to. There are too few women here, as in very many decision-making bodies around the world. Gender equality is about making use of all human resources. Women are strong, but they are made vulnerable through legal, economic and social discrimination. Women are made victims of violence in war, of abuse at home, of trafficking, of sexual exploitation. For these women, gender equality is a question of life and death. Womens equal rights to a professional career and to participate in politics are not to education, The decision to cut poverty by half by 2015 is imperative, but we are not doing well enough. The pace at which the goal is being realized is far too slow. We now need new financial mechanisms and partnerships. In this spirit, we welcome the initiative presented a few days ago by the President of Brazil. to Official development assistance needs to treble. In Monterrey, the States members of the European Union agreed increase official development assistance. Sweden is increasing its assistance to 0.86 per cent of its gross domestic product next year. Pledges must be followed by real cash money. We need to give the United Nations predictable, long-term financing. I entirely agree with what President Chirac said a few days ago: “Failing that, we will end up with a pick-and-choose United Nations”. () 33 The international community must do its utmost to assist the parties in the peace process. The road map, as Jack Straw pointed out only a few minutes ago, should be implemented immediately with a view to the establishment of a peaceful and democratic Palestinian State in 2005. International monitors and observers should be sent to the area and Sweden is willing to take part in such a monitoring mechanism. and the in Iraq commitment of Sergio Vieira de Mello and many of his colleagues lost their lives in the bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad about a month ago, a terrible loss for the international community. Sergio Vieira de Mello personified, better than most, the strength international community at its best. The situation remains volatile and dangerous. We are concerned about the security of the Iraqi people and of those who are in Iraq to ease their suffering. The bombing in Baghdad was aimed at the purposes that the United Nations stands for — to maintain international peace and security. It will not make us waiver. The United Nations will stay in Iraq. The international community needs the legitimacy of the United Nations as the only authority to be derived from recover self- government and rebuild their country. The handling of the conflict must remain an exception and not become a rule. Iraqi people in helping the The future of the United Nations now lies in the hands of the Member States. If the United Nations fails, we all fail. In the statements most referred to so far in this years debate, the media have competed in finding differences and disputes, but there is one thing that we all agree on. That is the belief in our United Nations. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has the world behind him"}}
