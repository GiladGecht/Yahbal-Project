This universal forum has enabled the peoples of the world to coordinate and harmonize in preserving peace and security, in achieving prosperity and upholding the values of human civilization. their efforts I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on being elected to preside over this august body and to express my confidence successful leadership. in your I would also like, on behalf of Albania, to convey to the Secretary-General our highest appreciation for his leading contribution to the fulfilment of the historical mission of the United Nations and to the aspirations of our peoples for a better world in which only peace, democracy and economic prosperity reign. This session of the General Assembly takes place in a milestone year for Europe. Only a few months ago, a historic event vitalized the dream of a more united and stronger Europe. Ten European countries, sharing a common aspiration for integration, were admitted into the European Union. The Albanian Government and society are engaged in an all-round European integration process, and they are carrying out necessary reforms with the necessary political will and drive. Albania is working to strengthen the democratic institutions and capacities of its central and local government with a view to bringing its legislation and conditions into line with European Union standards, progressively achieving concrete and measurable results, as previously defined. security, Determined to make our contribution to regional and global the Albanian Government considers the country(cid:146)s integration into NATO to be one of its major objectives. The NATO Istanbul Summit last June commended the progress made by my country in this regard and encouraged the deepening of reforms. to regional stability and cooperation and committed to assess our further progress at the next NATO summit, which would hopefully mark the start of negotiations for our full membership in the alliance. We believe that the commitments set up in the framework of the Adriatic Charter are also contributing to meet NATO It welcomed Albania(cid:146)s contribution 37 standards, to the benefit of regional stability and security. as the relevant documents of We remain truly convinced that the respect and protection of human rights and freedoms are the main pillars of a pluralist democratic society. The Government of the Republic of Albania will continue to constantly demonstrate its commitment to a full implementation of the standards enshrined in the United Nations and Council of Europe conventions, as well regional organizations, such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in which we are playing a very active role. We will continue to do so in the future as well. By adopting contemporary legislation and by becoming adopted international instruments on human rights, Albania has associated itself with countries that are enforcing a number of national strategies and programmes focusing on specific population groups, especially women, children, persons in need and minorities, among others. In recent years, the Albanian Government has started to periodically submit reports to the committees of the six main United Nations human rights treaties and is taking their recommendations into serious consideration. It is our belief that these international mechanisms play a significant and important role as guardians of the common human values we have together adopted. to other a party recently Albania, as one of the 191 signatory countries of the Millennium Declaration, remains fully committed to implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, which have been properly reflected in a national strategy for social and economic development. The pattern of our sustained economic growth, which is at 6 to 7 per cent for the seventh consecutive year, is a good support base for the whole society to maintain higher standards of respect for human rights and to fight poverty and crime. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the United Nations specialized agencies for their the implementation of these objectives nationwide and on a central and local level. assistance valuable support of in The Albanian Government is pleased to note that an ever-healthier climate of confidence and relations of bilateral and multilateral cooperation are prevailing in the South-Eastern European region. The countries of the region are fully engaged in a process that will lead us clearly toward Euro-Atlantic integration and at the 38 integrated the more in Europe.(cid:148) same time continually remove us from the extremist tendencies that caused a number of conflicts in the last decade. The regional policy of my Government is guided by the motto: (cid:147)the more integrated in the region, In implementing this policy, Albania is cooperating as never before with all the countries of the region by making borders less relevant, opening up to one regional market the implementation of free trade free movement corridors, and agreements and stimulating are especially cooperating with the common fight against organized crime and all kinds of illegal trafficking. In the meantime, Albania its border management and control, guided by the European Union and NATO standards. investment. We foreign direct is reinforcing My country will hold general parliamentary elections by the middle of next year. We are committed to doing all that is required to ensure that the election process is fully compatible with international standards for free and fair elections. To that end, we are to work with relevant committed specialized fully implementing especially OSCOffice for Democratic Institutions (ODIHR) recommendations. For us, the process and standards are more important than the results of the elections. to continuing institutions on elections by Human Rights and In the context of strengthening regional cooperation, my country is committed to a more enhanced partnership with all regional organizations and initiatives that serve the promotion of good neighbourly relations; the strengthening of regional peace, security and stability; ensuring political support for into Euro-Atlantic structures, and attracting financing for national and regional projects in priority fields such as energy, transportation and telecommunications. integration the appreciates recent democratic On its path towards European integration, the South-East European region is still facing pending challenges, such as the future of Kosovo. Albania greatly and integration developments in Kosovo, thanks to the efforts of the respective peoples and the partnership of its self-governing institutions with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). Allow me at this point to congratulate Mr. Soren Jessen-Petersen, Special Representative for Kosovo of the United Nations Secretary-General, in assuming this very important duty. for a The Albanian Government shares the view that time has come rapid and coherent the the policy of standards of a implementation of for multiethnic democracy and European status Kosovo. This would be the key to the solution of a number of other issues. We truly hope that the question of the final status of Kosovo will reach a final solution soon, for the sake of the people of Kosovo and for the enhancement of the Europeanization process of the whole region. that In the meantime, we support all efforts to build a democratic and multicultural society in Kosovo that is governed by the rule of law, ethnic and religious tolerance and cohabitation. Particularly helpful in this regard would be the further energizing of UNMIK(cid:146)s transfer of authority to the legitimate institutions of Kosovo that are already being anchored to European integration agendas. We believe the upcoming October parliamentary elections, the Albanian and other ethnic communities of Kosovo will demonstrate their best values, taking a major step toward the consolidation of multiethnic democracy in the region. We also hope that the Serbian minority in Kosovo will assume its responsibilities and, through a free vote, make their contribution to the European future of Kosovo. Their participation in all levels of the democratic institutions of Kosovo would the consolidation of peace, stability and the European perspective in the whole region. contribute further in to My Government supports a stimulation of direct dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade, both on political and technical issues. This is fundamental in resolving the pending problems and is in accordance with the spirit of regional and European integration. The tragic terrorist attack one year ago in Baghdad, which took the lives of 22 people, including United Nations Under-Secretary-General Sergio Vieira de Mello, is still fresh in our memories. Such hideous and punishable acts, which continued in the following days and months there and in other countries of the world, such as Turkey, Spain, Russia, Indonesia and others, show that terrorism is today the biggest threat to international peace and security, to stability and to the values of world democracy and civilization. In the global effort to combat terrorism, our countries have already understood that, first of all, it cannot be identified with one people, one religion, one race or only certain groups of society. We believe that the fight against terrorism will only be successful if we join efforts. In the that context, we international cooperation among strengthening of States and international organizations, in which the United Nations has an irreplaceable role. support The Albanian Government has been consistently committed to making its contribution as an active member of the international coalition against terrorism. We have peacekeeping troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have signed, ratified and now are implementing 12 United Nations conventions and protocols against terrorism. We are doing the same with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, cooperating with and presenting regular reports to the Council. The Albanian Government salutes the decision of the Security Council to play a more active role in the fight against threats stemming from the possession and trafficking of weapons of mass destruction. We support Security Council resolution 1540 (2004). the other hand, Albania has, on taken all measures for the implementation of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), convinced that this international instrument is extremely important to preventing threats stemming from the misuse of radioactive materials. Albania has already taken the decision and will soon sign the Protocol Additional to the Safeguards Agreement of the the Proliferation Security Initiative, with its respective commitments that will create benefits for all. IAEA. This year, Albania also joined Peace and stability have not been fully established in certain regions of the world. The United Nations and the Security Council are the authorities mandated by the Charter to preserve peace and security globally. It is only natural that crisis-solving solutions and initiatives in such hot spots around the globe as Iraq, the Middle East, Afghanistan, Sudan and so on remain high on their agenda. We believe that a more active engagement of the international community is required in finding the most suitable and lasting solutions for those crisis situations, as is the further enhancement of the role and effectiveness of the United Nations structures. In that regard, the Albanian Government welcomed the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 1546 (2004) of 8 June on Iraq, approving the 39 the provisional Government of Iraq and transferring to it authority and sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Iraq, Iraqi Government control of the armed forces and, in particular, the holding of democratic elections in early 2005. The progress made in Iraq is due to the cooperation between the Iraqi Government forces and those of the Coalition. We would wish, however, to see a further lowering of tensions and a full stop to violence. We would wish for increased security, more stability and the establishment of a democratic society. That is why we strongly condemn the strategy of violence and hostage-taking to achieve political goals, sometimes cloaked under a religious veil, and we join our voice to those of all the international actors that have called for an immediate stop to those acts. The Albanian Government supports the efforts of the United Nations to provide the assistance necessary to build national democratic institutions in Iraq and to the holding of free and democratic elections early next year. My Government also follows with great concern the developments in the Middle East. Like the whole international community, we hope to see an end put to the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories, where violence towards the civilian population is increasingly claiming innocent lives, especially those of women and children. On the other hand, we condemn any terrorist act against the civilian population, irrespective of whose name it is committed in. The Albanian Government strongly believes that peace can and should be achieved only through dialogue and negotiation. We are convinced that the Security Council, the Quartet and the international community have the authority and the capacity to establish a stable peace in Palestine and throughout the the Security Council(cid:146)s Middle East based on resolutions and international community should continue to monitor closely the implementation of the road map in order to avoid any deviation from or change, misinterpretation or blocking of it by the parties to the conflict. the road map. The Current developments and the international arena, and the acute problems and challenges we are all facing (cid:151) such as preserving peace and security, facing the threats and dangers of terrorism, the fight against poverty and fatal diseases, realities in 40 the effects of globalization and environmental degradation (cid:151) have increasingly sharpened the need to revitalize our Organization. The Albanian Government is fully supportive of the efforts of the Secretary- General to reform the Organization, in particular the initiatives taken regarding the reform of the Security Council. We join with the voices that call for a stronger United Nations and for more efficient organs and mechanisms engaged in monitoring the implementation of obligations by United Nations Member States, in particular those concerning global security. We therefore think that the time has come to have a more representative, more transparent and more flexible Security Council that could better reflect current realities. Its enlargement with permanent and non-permanent members would the possibilities for all States Members of the United Nations the preservation of international peace and stability. It would be a significant step towards the completion of United Nations reform. contribute increase to to My country is willing to contribute further to the activities of the United Nations, especially in the global and regional agendas related to sustainable economic and social development and the protection of fundamental freedoms and human rights universally. To that end, Albania has modestly presented for the first time its candidacy to become a member of the Economic and Social Council the period 2005-2007. We hope we shall succeed. for the Olympic Games A few weeks ago, the whole world witnessed the successful conclusion of in Athens. Gathered around the Olympic torch, sportsmen and women demonstrated how closely nations can stand with one another and how we can get rid of hatred and conflict from our midst. Let the symbol of Olympic peace and fraternity help us to build a better, more secure world for us and for generations to come. "}}
