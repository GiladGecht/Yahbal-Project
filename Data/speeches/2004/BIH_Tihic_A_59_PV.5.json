{"speech":{"0":" I wish to greet you all and express my great pleasure at having this opportunity to address this Assembly. I also wish to thank the United Nations, once again, for everything it has done and is doing for my country. Specifically, I would like to stress the importance of giving support to the returnees who were expelled from their homes. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a multi-ethnic country in which Bosnian Muslims, Orthodox Serbs, Catholic Croats, Jews and many other ethnicities lived in peace and tolerance for hundreds of years. In Sarajevo and in most other Bosnian towns, one can find mosques, Orthodox and Catholic churches and Jewish temples that have stood side by side for hundreds of years. For this reason, Sarajevo is called the Jerusalem of Europe. Preserving the multi-ethnic structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with all its characteristics and diversities, presents an historic challenge, not only to Europe, but the whole world. Bosnia and Herzegovina is the foremost meeting point of world cultures and religions. It therefore refutes the theory of the clash of civilizations. to I would like to update you on the situation in my country, which has made significant progress over the last nine years. increased 14 The infrastructure destroyed in the war has been rebuilt and macroeconomic stability has been achieved, with only 1 per cent inflation. The banking system has been consolidated and foreign debts are being paid off. Since the post-war period, the gross domestic product has increased three times over and national reserves have times over. Foreign currency reserves and savings are constantly increasing as well. We are on the right path to meeting all the the requirements European Union (EU) on stabilization and association agreements. Due to the Republika Srpska entity(cid:146)s failure to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), we have been unable to gain Partnership for Peace membership, although we meet all of the requirements. starting negotiations with for Strong reforms are under way in the areas of education, customs, taxes, security and the defence This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of speeches delivered in the other languages.

Many new central institutions have been set up, such as the Defence and Security Ministry, the intelligence service, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Joint Military Command and others. Compared with the approximately 500,000 soldiers of the three separate armies in 1995, the Bosnia and Herzegovina military forces now have 12,000 soldiers. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) had some 70,000 soldiers in Bosnia in 1996, and the Stabilization Force (SFOR) now has about 7,000. The security situation is stable; the peace has never been broken. Since the Dayton Peace Accords were signed, not a single foreign soldier has been killed in Bosnia. Instead of being a consumer of is increasingly becoming a participant in international peace missions, such as those in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, Liberia, Timor-Leste, Haiti and others. international aid, Bosnia and Herzegovina The common foreign, security and defence policies of the European Union have enabled the EU to take the leading role in Bosnia and Herzegovina. By the end of this year, EU military forces will take over from SFOR in Bosnia. The positive stabilization process (cid:151) as well as the overall progress made not only in Bosnia, but also in the other countries created after the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia (cid:151) is being slowed down by an inappropriate attitude towards war crimes and war criminals. Some public and political officials are trying to find an excuse for the war crimes, saying they were committed in the interest of vital ethnic protection. Yet war criminals are treated as national heroes. This must be changed. Only on the basis of truth and justice can we build confidence and reconciliation among the people and friendly relations among our respective countries. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has an irreplaceable role to play in that process. We deeply appreciate the work it has done so far. In our view, it must finish the trials that have already begun, particularly those of the highest-level officials. Some of the cases not yet completed can be transferred only to courts of countries where the crimes happened. This can be done only when those countries are prepared to guarantee fair and correct trials. Full cooperation with the ICTY must be an unavoidable requirement for accession to Euro-Atlantic institutions. Moreover, it is not enough to arrest and 2 prosecute only war criminals on the ICTY(cid:146)s list. Local courts in our respective countries must prosecute thousands of other war criminals who are still at large, who constitute a destabilizing factor, who hinder positive processes, and who are often connected with organized crime. In my country, we are going to establish within the Bosnia and Herzegovina Court a war crimes chamber. The chamber will take over some of the Hague Tribunal(cid:146)s cases, but it will also prosecute many other criminals. It is going to be The Hague in miniature. We will technical and financial support, and we will have involve international judges and prosecutors with experience in such trials, above all those who have worked at The Hague Tribunal. therefore need to Next year will be the tenth anniversary of the genocide against Bosnian Muslims in the United Nations safe havens of Srebrenica and Zepa. The people most responsible for that genocide, as well as for all other war crimes committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina (cid:151) Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic (cid:151) have not yet been arrested. Those two men are responsible for the death of about 200,000 people. From this rostrum, I call on all in authority to arrest them. The outstanding issue of about 15,000 missing persons, whose bodies are spread among numerous mass graves throughout the country, 320 of which have been found so far in Bosnia, presents a big problem for my country. We need help in finding the missing and identifying them. The political system set up by the Dayton and Washington Agreements played a positive role in establishing peace, reconstruction and progress in my country. However, they are now increasingly becoming an obstacle to further development and progress. The current administration in Bosnia, with a federation composed of 10 cantons, a republic and a district (cid:151) strong entities and a weak State (cid:151) is an obstacle in our way is an extremely complicated and expensive system that is barely operational. The people, both in Bosnia and Herzegovina and outside, are aware of this to varying degrees. towards Euro-Atlantic integration. It I believe the time is coming for domestic political representatives to start to discuss the revision of its compliance with Bosnia(cid:146)s constitution and international conventions. We have to create an efficient State with institutions and mandates that will enable us to become a full member of the EU and NATO. I hope we will get support and help from friendly countries and the international community as a whole. A good opportunity for this will be next year, the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords. It is time for Bosnia to turn from the Dayton phase to the Brussels phase. for sovereignty, Bosnia and Herzegovina is sincerely and firmly committed to strengthening friendly relations with the neighbouring Republic of Croatia and the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro on the basis of mutual respect integrity and equality. Our geographical location, history, ethnic composition infrastructure connections are leading us towards overall cooperation. We are aware that, without a resolution of disputed issues, we cannot proceed to European integration; we already have achieved some progress in this regard. economic further territorial and and The countries of South-Eastern Europe have made huge individual and joint efforts to achieve great progress in changing the stereotype of the region as a backward, problematic and conflict-ridden area of the European suburbs. Regional cooperation is being promoted in the areas of defence, security, border control, regimes, combating corruption and organized crime and the protection of ethnic and religious minorities. free markets, visa The issue of borders in the region cannot and must not be opened again. We have to arrange such matters in compliance with European standards. However, we have to open the issue of cooperation with respect to borders, since it is in our common interest. I think that the Iraqi crisis needs to be resolved simultaneously with the Palestinian issue. We therefore support the initiative of the Quartet and the road map as a basis for setting up a sincere dialogue between the two States, with United States mediation. We also strongly condemn all terrorist acts, as well as execution without trial of Palestinian religious leaders. We strongly condemn the Israeli side(cid:146)s construction of the protection wall. We are happy with the consensus among Security Council members on the transfer of sovereignty from coalition forces to the legitimately elected legal and law. The executive authorities in Iraq. We think the United Nations should take the leading role in shaping the future of Iraq. The Iraqi people need to govern their own country, and the military forces that control the territory must respect the Geneva Conventions and humanitarian integrity and sovereignty of Iraq must be preserved, including sovereignty over its natural resources. We call for protection of Iraq(cid:146)s world heritage civilization and holy places, such as Karbala and the Imam Ali mosque in Najaf. With a view to helping the people of Iraq and contributing to the establishment of peace there, Bosnia and Herzegovina has sent a unit to Iraq to destroy mines and unexploded devices. territorial My country is sincerely committed to combating international terrorism and is an active participant in the international anti-terrorist coalition. Terrorism is not only a threat to peace and security; in our view, it is immoral and counterproductive. It is immoral because innocent people are killed, and it is counterproductive because terrorism cannot resolve problems. It only produces new ones. In that regard, I would like to highlight here the example of Bosnian Muslims, since we were the major victim of the aggression against Bosnia between 1992 and 1995. We managed to defend ourselves, but both during and after the war we never turned our hands to revenge or terrorism. Allow me to review the issue of Security Council reform, as well as that of strengthening the efficiency of the mechanisms of the United Nations. The citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina know from their own experience what a lack of proper and efficient United If United Nations Nations action can mean. mechanisms were more efficient, the aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina would not have happened or, at least, the war would not have been so long. If they were more efficient, then genocide would not have been committed in the United Nations safe havens of Srebrenica and Zepa. For that reason, I want to remind everyone of the Organization(cid:146)s obligation to assist the survivors in those areas. When considering the situation in the world today, the question of efficient cooperation in the area of security is inevitably raised. The Security Council needs to be the leading factor for peace and stability in the world. It has to have at its disposal mechanisms that can be operated with efficiency and speed in order to prevent conflicts from becoming military clashes. 3 Among other proposals, we support the initiatives to enlarge the Security Council(cid:146)s membership. Bosnia and Herzegovina wants to become a non- permanent member of the Security Council. In terms of Security Council efficiency, our experience has been mostly a negative one. Through our participation in the work of the Council, we hope to prevent a repetition of our experience elsewhere in the world. Therefore, we take this opportunity to confirm our intention of putting forth our candidature for the 2010-2011 term. Bosnia and Herzegovina deserves that honour and we are determined to prove our worth. "}}
