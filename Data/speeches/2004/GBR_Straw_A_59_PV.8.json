{"speech":{"0":" Mr. President, I offer my congratulations and those of my country on your election as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. Eighteen months ago, the United Nations faced divisions more serious than any since the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962. We all worried whether the strength and unity which we had built up since the end of the cold war could survive. Then last year we watched, as Secretary-General Kofi Annan stood at his now famous fork in the road. In the year since, almost instinctively, we have decided to follow our Secretary-General(cid:146)s directions. This Organization has not been plunged, as some predicted, into paralysis; instead, I have felt a powerful if unspoken determination to make the United Nations work, and to work more effectively, to fulfil its central task: to secure peace around the world. Over the last 12 months we have dealt with new crises such as that in Darfur in the Sudan, where we have set clear tasks for both the Sudanese Government and the rebel groups. We have tackled the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Great Lakes; mobilized international support for the new Iraq; and addressed a long list of hugely important subjects which rarely receive the coverage they should in the media (cid:151) Haiti, Georgia, Timor-Leste, Bougainville and Western Sahara. We have shown in those actions the unity of purpose which is one of the strongest weapons in our hands to defeat the evils which today affect the globe. And the search for consensus has not been confined to the Security Council. I am proud that just a few months after the difficult times of early last year, France, Germany and the United Kingdom came together to work, as we continue the International Atomic Energy Agency. the Iran dossier before to do, on I recognize, of course, the frustrations which all of us feel, not least over the Israel-Palestine conflict, where the clear path to peace set out in the road map and endorsed by the Security Council remains elusive. But all in all we have shown the will to make collective action work, though we know, too, that we need to go further. In particular, we need to get better at tackling threats which have changed dramatically since the founding of the United Nations. Today the greatest threats to our security often come not from other functioning sovereign States, but terrorist organizations, from failing States and from man-made shocks to our environment like climate change, which can exacerbate State internal instability. failure and breed from the Secretary-General The High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change appointed by is preparing its recommendations on ways to address the various challenges. We should remember in all this that we have one great advantage. Though its institutions and the founding text of the Charter has hardly changed in 60 years, the United Nations is not an organization set in stone, but a set of living institutions based on a shared will to make collective security work. The United Nations has adapted in the past (cid:151) with the development of peacekeeping, a greater focus on individual rights and the setting of global targets for 33 development (cid:151) and I am confident that it can adapt in the future. time. Today Of course, institutional change is part of that. At the United Nations foundation, one eighth of its members could expect to be elected members of the Security Council at any one that proportion is less than one eighteenth. The United Kingdom has long supported the case for expanding the Security Council to, say, 24 members, and for including amongst the permanent members: Germany and Japan, them contribute 28 per cent of the budget of the United Nations; India, which represents one sixth of the entire world(cid:146)s population; and Brazil, which just missed permanent membership back in 1945. two countries which between But we should not see an expansion of the Security Council, or other institutional change, as a panacea. The biggest need is to adapt our common understanding (cid:151) the United Nations jurisprudence, if you like (cid:151) and its operational effectiveness so that we can respond more quickly and more thoroughly to today(cid:146)s new threats. Let me highlight three areas which to me seem particularly important: first, our approach must be broader and must tackle threats to the most vulnerable, including environmental degradation; secondly, we must build a new consensus by expanding the scope of collective action; and, thirdly, we must deal with the threat of terrorism, which menaces us all and everything for which we stand. poverty, disease and Let me now take these three points in turn. First, there is the need for a broader approach which addresses the complex and interdependent nature of security today. Here, we have to do more to meet the Millennium Development Goals and to promote sustainable development, especially in Africa. We cannot have security without development or development without security. As the Secretary-General highlighted in his speech this week, we have to do more to entrench the rule of law and justice, especially in States recovering from conflict. The United Kingdom will pursue work on the Secretary-General(cid:146)s report during its Security Council presidency next month. We could also use the United Nations better, to agree to monitor and help implement globally accepted norms of good governance. 34 And we need to act together quickly on climate change, perhaps the greatest long-term threat to our world in terms of stability and security. We have to implement Kyoto (cid:151) and I greatly welcome what my colleague, His Excellency Sergey Lavrov had to say on that today (cid:151) and agree to emission reductions beyond 2012. My second point is the need to build a new consensus on the scope of collective action. We all represent independent, sovereign states. But even as we founded that sovereignty was a trust in the hands of a nation(cid:146)s government: there to be respected, not abused, from either without or within. the United Nations we recognized The Charter set out arrangements so that an abuse from without could be dealt with through the inherent right of self-defence recognized in Article 51 of the Charter. But it also said that an abuse from within which threatens the peace could and should be dealt with by the Security Council, under the powers enshrined in the other articles of Chapter VII of the Charter, and by the many conventions concluded within the United Nations framework, including, for example, the 1948 Geneva Convention. No longer (cid:151) we all said (cid:151) could or should the world turn away from unspeakable barbarities like that of the Holocaust. But we have not always lived up to those high expectations, as the tragedies of Rwanda and Bosnia ten years ago reminded us. Today we must resolve to do so and to engage in situations of humanitarian catastrophe or grave violations of international humanitarian law and to act in the face of other threats to international peace and security. The principle of non-interference has to be qualified by a duty to protect, especially where Governments are failing in that duty. We therefore need, for example, to be ready to support greater use by the Secretary-General of his powers under Article 99 of the Charter, to bring threats to peace to the Security Council(cid:146)s attention. We have to act quickly in response, because prevention is far better than cure. We should look to work more closely with regional organizations, as we are doing with the African Union in Darfur. We need more discussion on the criteria as to when the international community might have to intervene with military force in extreme circumstances. We must get better at engaging for the in countries recovering from conflict, long term coordinating our efforts in response to locally agreed priorities. to protect citizens from abuse by States, not by terrorists. My third point is the urgent need to combat global terrorism, a menace directed at us all. If we have learned anything in the three years since 11 September 2001 it is that international terrorism is indiscriminate in its targets and merciless in its hatred. Christian, Jew, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Muslim, people of no religion or any religion, and of every or no shade of political opinion, all have died through the terrorists(cid:146) bullet or bomb. My friend Sergey Lavrov spoke eloquently a moment ago about the tears still wet for the terrible, unspeakable massacre of the young and innocent that took place in Beslan. Sergey, your tears are my tears; Russia(cid:146)s tears are the world(cid:146)s tears. We are all in the fight against terrorism together. Today in Iraq we are seeing again the depths to which the terrorists plumb. The vast majority of the victims of terrorism in Iraq are Iraqis. Our thoughts and condolences are with the Government and people of Iraq and with their families. But some of the victims of terrorism in Iraq are foreigners who are helping Iraqis to build a more stable and prosperous country. One of them is Kenneth Bigley, a British engineer held hostage by terrorists who have already barbarically murdered his two American comrades. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families. We continue to do all we can to secure Mr. Bigley(cid:146)s release. I know (cid:151) how could I forget (cid:151) that opinions have differed over the rightness of the military action taken in Iraq 18 months ago. But I warrant that no nation is in favour of the terrorist insurgency now occurring there. For we all recognize that what is being attempted by the terrorists in Iraq is an attack both on the Iraqi people and on everything for which the Organization stands: safety, security and human rights. We have to come together to defeat the terrorists and their despicable aims. The threat of terrorism confronts democratic, properly functioning States with an acute dilemma, namely, how to fight those who recognize none of the values for which we stand while remaining true to those values. Our commitments under international conventions express many of those values and the importance that we attach to them. But equally, those conventions cannot be allowed those involved in terrorism. The conventions were designed to shelter The 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees protects those with a well-founded fear of persecution. I am proud that the United Kingdom and so many other nations have offered that protection when and where it was required. But as the 1951 Convention itself sets out, asylum is not an unqualified right. It does not apply to anyone who has committed a war crime, a crime against humanity or other serious crime; nor does it apply to anyone who is guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. We must never stoop to the level of the terrorist (cid:151) to torture, mistreatment or unjustified incarceration (cid:151) nor will any country within the European Union be party to the return of suspects to such conditions, nor to face the death penalty. But we cannot let terrorists exploit a protection designed for the persecuted, not the persecutors. We in the United Kingdom shall therefore be working closely with Russia on its important draft Security Council resolution, to see how best we can prevent those who commit, support and finance terrorism from sheltering behind a refugee status to which they are not entitled. Along with the Russian Federation and other partners in the Security Council, we also wish to look at ways to ensure the speedier extradition of such individuals. again here to review We, the United Nations, have over the last year begun to show a new determination to come together and to make collective action work. A year from now, we will meet the recommendations of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, as well as the Millennium Development Goals, and to set the United Nations agenda for the next decade. The United Kingdom(cid:146)s chairmanship of the G-8 next year will focus on tackling climate change and on Africa, on which the Independent Commission for Africa will be producing recommendations as to how best we can support the radical agenda for change and development designed by Africa itself through the New Partnership for Africa(cid:146)s Development and the African Union. Our presidency of the European Union will help us to lead efforts the Doha Development Round, and for building the European Union(cid:146)s crisis-management capabilities. for a successful outcome in More than ever, global security is our shared responsibility. In the year ahead, as we continue to 35 adapt to today(cid:146)s threats and challenges, we must find renewed determination and political will to make collective security work. The United Kingdom is determined to play its full part in that endeavour. "}}
