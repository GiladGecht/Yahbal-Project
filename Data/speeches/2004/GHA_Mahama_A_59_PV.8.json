{"speech":{"0":" I have the distinct honour to congratulate you, Mr. President, a distinguished African diplomat, on your election to preside over the fifty-ninth session of this Assembly and to wish you success in your undertaking. I would also like to commend your predecessor, Mr. Julian Hunte, for the dedication and commitment that he brought to bear on his stewardship of the fifty-eighth session. Three years ago, a terrible tragedy hit this city. The unprecedented terrorist attacks of 11 September resulted in the death of thousands of innocent people of many nationalities, including some from my own country, Ghana. The whole world shared the pain and sorrow of New York in the aftermath of those atrocities. The whole world also rose in solidarity with the people of the United States to ensure that such tragedies would not happen again. 11 September reminds us of the importance of seeking a multilateral and peaceful means for the maintenance of international peace and security, especially now, when it has become evident that only collective, multilateral efforts will suffice to defeat the new scourge of mankind, global terrorism. The United Nations has an indispensable role to play, being the most universal and representative intergovernmental organization and the best forum for the practice of multilateralism. However, the success of 17 multilateralism and collective security will depend on how the reforms of the United Nations system are implemented. In this regard, we applaud the initiative of our illustrious compatriot, Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in setting up the United Nations High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, to make proposals on how the United Nations can best be reformed to meet the new challenges of our world. We, in Africa, agree that the objectives of the United Nations reforms, including the revitalization of the General Assembly and the reform of the Security Council, are aimed at enhancing the role of the Organization and its capacity to overcome current threats and emerging challenges. The reforms should be in conformity with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and the process must be based on full consultations in a democratic and transparent manner. To this end, we look forward to a revitalized General Assembly that would assume its rightful position as the most authoritative and representative organ of the United Nations. With regard to the Security Council, the African position emphasizes the need to democratize and ensure equitable geographical representation, with Africa allotted no less than two permanent seats and five non- permanent seats in the expanded Security Council. and the promotion of in developing countries I wish to address the crucial issue of poverty sustainable eradication development in which widespread poverty is endemic, particularly in Africa. As we strive to overcome our current economic woes, we need the world(cid:146)s solidarity, resources, technical know-how and support. The historic Millennium Summit of the United Nations, which brought together 189 nations in September 2000 and adopted the Millennium Declaration, was a clarion call for action to solve these problems and set forth the Millennium Development Goals with measurable goals and targets for combating them. On that occasion, the international community pledged to spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty. Africa has adopted the New Partnership for Africa(cid:146)s Development (NEPAD), which reaffirms our belief that Africans have the primary responsibility to solve the problems of poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy afflicting the majority of our population and to stem Africa(cid:146)s marginalization from global markets. In tandem, 18 we are striving to foster political stability, accountable and transparent governance under the rule of law, because we believe it is the right thing to do. Ghana has volunteered as the first country in Africa for the African Peer Review Mechanism, and my Government is cooperating with the review panel to facilitate the preparation of the review report, because we in Ghana cherish very much our democracy and our commitment of respect for human rights and the rule of law. fully with Our renewed resolve, within the context of NEPAD, to accelerate the sustainable development of the continent, dovetails the avowed commitment of the international community to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals. It was, therefore, a very welcome and positive development when the General Assembly, in its resolution of 4 November 2002, urged the international community to organize support for African countries within the framework of the principles, objectives and priorities of NEPAD. However, for this convergence of vision and effort to yield the desired results, there must be genuine the international community. between Africa partnership and The implementation of NEPAD and the creation of institutions such as the Pan-African Parliament, the Peace and Security Council, the Economic, Social and Cultural Council, and various commissions of the recently established African Union, reflect Africa(cid:146)s determination to be the architect of its own future. The the Economic Community of West initiatives of African States, the West African regional body currently chaired by the President of Ghana, Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor, in dealing with the conflicts that have recently plagued our region are good examples of this development. Accra has been the venue for successful peace talks concerning Liberia and, most recently, on 29 July 2004, C(cid:244)te d(cid:146)Ivoire, which has revived hopes for a durable peace in that important West African country. The important decisions taken at the last summit of the African Union in Addis Ababa have given cause for cautious optimism as the political leadership, Governments, the public, civil society and the private sector now seem to have embarked upon a journey of collaborative effort to put an end to conflicts and to focus instead on the promotion of peace, security and sustainable development for the benefit of the peoples of the continent. the the good intentions of It is disheartening, though, to observe that, despite international community, as exemplified at the various international forums that have followed the Millennium Summit, there has not been any significant achievement due to the absence of genuine global partnership for development. There continues to be an agonizing paradox between the summit and conference declarations of a new global partnership and the persistence of an asymmetrical global system that works largely against the interests of developing countries. trade system, particularly Quite evidently, the laudable long-term initiatives to halve hunger and poverty by the year 2015 cannot be achieved without a fundamental restructuring of the global in agricultural products. Such an initiative should include developed countries(cid:146) dismantling subsidies and lowering tariffs, thereby helping to uphold and safeguard an open, equitable, rule-based, predictable, non-discriminatory trading and financial system. The concerns of developing countries have been reiterated in this Assembly over the years; we therefore urge our developed partners to act now. the implementation of For many countries in Africa, stable long-term planning will be impossible without more systematic and sustained debt relief. Despite the progress recorded the enhanced Heavily in Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative and the provision of substantial debt relief by bilateral official creditors, achieving long-term debt sustainability and, at the same time, a reduction in poverty as targeted, remains a major problem for many African countries. We, therefore, welcome the initiative of British Prime Minister Tony Blair the African Commission. in setting up sources of role financing to play an essential Official development assistance (ODA), as we are in aware, continues complementing other for development and creating a congenial environment for private sector activity. Although ODA flows, which decreased in the 1990s, have picked up in recent years, the fact that these flows remain, on average, still far below internationally agreed targets is a major cause for concern. In this connection, it is pertinent to recall that an additional $50 billion a year in development assistance would be required as a minimum to meet the Millennium Development Goals. The fundamental question facing the international community is whether it is committed to the indispensable, challenging, but ultimately rewarding global partnership, which alone can make this dream come true. threat to achieving The HIAIDS pandemic is a global emergency and a key the Millennium Development Goals, especially for countries in sub- Saharan Africa. The pandemic has caused untold suffering and death in our countries, destroying entire communities, reversing development gains and posing a serious security threat. Unfortunately, despite the substantial measures taken by the Government in combating the scourge, Ghana(cid:146)s efforts have been severely constrained by a lack of adequate resources required to prevent new infections, provide care and support for people, particularly women living with HIAIDS. We wish international community to provide the needed resources for the fight against this global emergency. children the to urge and to Ghana importance attaches great the empowerment of women to make them equal partners in the formulation and implementation of development policies. Since the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcome of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, gender equality has been an essential element of Ghana(cid:146)s efforts to attain sustainable development. The active involvement of women in political processes and decision-making at all levels and in all sectors is being vigorously pursued. Impediments such as discrimination and violence against women are being dealt with through education, advocacy and legislation. Despite the strong political will within the international community to create a world fit for children, the reality in many parts of the world is a far cry from the ideals voiced at the twenty-seventh special session of the General Assembly, on children. We call for the adoption of effective policies to eradicate poverty, to ensure access to education and to provide families with support to guarantee the well- being of children. Decisive international cooperation is also required to strengthen legal and other preventive mechanisms increasing practice of child for unconscionable exploitative purposes. tackle effectively trafficking the to Ghana believes that the staff of the Organization, who make sacrifices daily to maintain peace and security in zones of conflict and humanitarian disaster, deserve to be provided with a secure and safe 19 environment in which to operate. In that regard, we will continue to condemn all attacks against United Nations personnel and call for firm action by States to establish conditions that prevent such attacks, in fulfilment of the obligations of host countries towards the United Nations and its personnel. Ghana, as a major troop-contributing country, will continue to support United Nations peacekeeping operations globally, as well as in Africa. That commitment, which began with our participation in the United Nations Operation in the Congo in 1960, is born of the firm moral conviction in our solidarity for humanity and the knowledge that a lack of peace and stability anywhere can be a real threat to peace and security for all of us. In conclusion, I urge Member States to rededicate themselves individually and collectively to the ideals that underpin the Organization and provide it with the commensurate resources as it strives to fulfil the aspirations of the peoples of the world. We cannot, should not and must not fail in that undertaking. "}}
