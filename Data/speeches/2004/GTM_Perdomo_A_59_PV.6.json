{"speech":{"0":" I would like to begin by expressing our appreciation to Mr. Julian Hunte, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saint Lucia, for his accomplished and skilful leadership of the General Assembly during its previous session. I would also like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I would also like to commend the Secretary- General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the great wisdom that he has shown in the discharge of his functions. He deserves our respect and appreciation, and we extend to him our support and solidarity. My country has reached a crucial point in its history. It faces the challenge of living up to the expectations raised by the end of the internal armed conflict. Since January, when I assumed office, the frustrated hopes of all of our people have been rekindled. My plan of government is predicated on the peace agreements and defines their implementation as a commitment of the whole nation. As President of Guatemala, I endorse fully the principle that a firm and lasting peace must be based on participatory socio- economic development, aimed at achieving the common good and responding to the needs of all of our people, particularly in extreme poverty. those still living Since I took office, I have made a point of listening to the opinions of all of our citizens. That has enabled me facing Guatemala, which it must overcome if it is to deal adequately with the many legitimate social demands and expectations. the constraints identify to of conditions investment; The actions that my Government intends to take in the period 2004 to 2008 will focus on four areas: social production; environmental sustainability; and security for all. Those policies are being carried out within the framework of the principles of solidarity and inclusiveness; decentralization and participation; and transparency in public actions. Those areas of action and principles accord fully with the Millennium Development Goals. like to single out a number of achievements resulting from our new approach to government. We have reduced our troop strength by 43 per cent and have begun to modernize the armed forces and to make them more professional, consistent with the functions that they are required to perform in time of peace. This includes, at the international level, greater participation by the Guatemalan army in United Nations peace operations, for example in Haiti. I would In terms of public spending, we are according priority to education, health, security, citizenship and infrastructure. focusing We are fighting petty crime, gang-related crime in particular on and organized crime, combating drug terrorism, smuggling, money laundering, trafficking in persons and the illegal arms trade, all of which represent a huge challenge that cannot be overcome without the international community. the support of trafficking, We are waging an all-out war against corruption, and creating mechanisms to ensure transparency in public procurement and contracting. For the first time in the history of our country, charges of corruption are being investigated, and those found guilty will be prosecuted. We have adopted a series of measures aimed at elaborating and implementing a fiscal pact. Sustained efforts are being made to meet the taxation goals set out in the peace agreements, within the framework of my Governments objectives for economic growth. We have, as a matter of priority, established a national front against hunger and malnutrition. Working with civil society, we have elaborated a policy on food and nutritional security. We have consolidated our responsible approach to macroeconomic management; that is necessary if we to promote competitiveness and productive are investment all Guatemalans. launched a programme for economic and social recovery, entitled Vamos Guatemala. ensure this context, we the well-being of and In We have taken firm measures to eliminate extreme poverty and reduce social exclusion, while fully respecting our diversity — for Guatemala is a multi-ethnic, multicultural and multilingual country. My Government is committed to full respect for human rights. We believe that every Guatemalan should enjoy basic rights and fundamental freedoms, and that the right to development must be ensured. In this cooperate with international bodies that promote and protect human rights. context, Guatemala will My Governments foreign policy is consistent with its national interests. Our guiding principle is the need to ensure that Guatemala can take its proper place in todays globalized world, as well as to strengthen multilateralism and regional integration. The presidents of the Central American countries have given greater impetus to our integration process. This year, we took the decisions required to bring to fruition a customs union between El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Guatemala. My Government is proposing a new beginning in its bilateral relationship with Belize. We must reach a permanent, just, equitable and honourable settlement of the territorial dispute between the two countries, while at the same time making a constructive effort to resolve the socio-economic problems afflicting our peoples. That is why my Government is promoting joint projects relating to production, a trade agreement, greater flexibility in the transit of persons, goods and services, full observance of human rights and the 11 conclusion of agreements for mutual legal assistance, all of which will contribute to the progress of our peoples and to the security of the region. at leading up the Guadalajara Summit, The Central American countries have just concluded trade negotiations with the United States. Last May, an announcement was made regarding the initiation of a process to an association agreement between Central America and the European Union, to include a free trade agreement. We will shortly be signing a trade agreement with Colombia, and we hope to conclude free trade agreements with Taiwan, MERCOSUR, the Andean Group and the Caribbean Community. the Looking after interests of Guatemalan emigrants is also a priority issue for my Government. We provide support for them as they seek solutions to their problems and respect for their fundamental rights. We are the receiving countries, particularly the United States of America, with a view to regularizing the situation of emigrants, who make a substantial contribution to the well-being of their communities. in contact with and achieve All the efforts that Guatemala is making to overcome poverty socio-economic development necessarily depend on the progress being made in multilateral trade negotiations. Guatemala appeals to the international community to fulfil its the longstanding commitments measures and practices to liberalize trade in our products and, more generally, to adopt measures enabling a country like Guatemala, which has been striving to open its economy, to obtain better opportunities for access to markets for its exports. to eliminate all that distort markets, May I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA), which, after 10 years of fruitful work, is reaching the end of its mandate. MINUGUA has left an important legacy in our country. I would like to turn now to our agenda at this session. We are convinced of the need to adapt the Organization threats and changes that humanity faces. We trust that 2005 will offer us an opportunity to react to them in a responsible manner. the new challenges, to 12 One of the most timely issues is the reform of the Security Council. Our position thereon has been evolving, reflecting the imperative need to make that organ more representative, transparent and effective. We advocate the expansion of its membership and could agree to such an expansion being applied to both categories of members — permanent and non- permanent — so long as the need to ensure adequate geographic representation is taken into account. The reform of the Security Council would be the point of departure for the adaptation of all the organs of the United Nations to the new circumstances. We favour the strengthening of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council. We reiterate our complete repudiation of all forms of terrorism. We are taking all feasible measures at the national level against the scourge and support the collective action of the international community to combat it, inter alia, through the implementation of Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1390 (2002), as well as participation in the relevant treaties. We are convinced of the need for a stronger collective capacity to prevent and resolve conflicts. We believe that the United Nations should continue to address the imperative of development, including such emerging issues as transnational migrations. We also feel that our Organization should play a vital role in seeking to ensure that the benefits of globalization are widely distributed among all countries. that connection, we wish to highlight the significance we attach the Johannesburg Plan of Action. the Monterrey Consensus and to In Guatemala is conscious of the divisions that persist in the Middle East, Asia and Africa among neighbouring countries. We earnestly hope that the disputes between through dialogue and other peaceful means, thus enabling all peoples of the world to be represented here without rejection or discrimination. them can be resolved on Taiwan, whose international I wish to note in particular our concern over the situation of the 23 million inhabitants of the Republic to of China representation remain unfulfilled. We also wish to voice our earnest hope that the difficult situation prevailing in the Middle East, which has deteriorated of late, will be resolved in conformity with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1397 (2002) and 1402 (2002). aspirations bodies in Under your guidance, Sir, this Assembly will have to address issues of the greatest significance for humankind and the United Nations. Guatemala undertakes to participate actively in this years debates and in the special event to be held just before our next regular session. We hasten to offer our cooperation with a view to the success of your endeavours. extreme poverty, environmental deterioration and unresolved development problems are global in nature and require a harmonizing centre that can support the efforts of the international community to find shared and consensual solutions in order to establish an international order that responds to the needs and aspirations of humankind.
