{"speech":{"0":" It is with great pleasure that I congratulate you, Sir, on your unanimous election to preside over the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly, an election that offers Africa its tenth presidency. The Gabonese Republic the international community the recognition it deserves thus has received from 22 and the French-speaking countries are delighted to see one of our own guiding our debates. Be assured that the delegation of Monaco, which I am leading, will fully support you in your noble mission in the service of peace and development. I would also like to hail the Secretary-General for his courage and his unwavering commitment to peace. A long time ago, the Organization began a process of thinking through the reforms that are required to improve its functioning. In that connection, I would like to congratulate the outgoing President of the Assembly, Mr. Julian Hunte, on his work during the fifty-eighth session; his perseverance made possible the adoption of new measures to revitalize the work of the General Assembly. While welcoming that progress, we know that we must continue along that path. Dedication to democracy and to the rule of law, unswerving confidence in the virtues of multilateralism and respect for our differences allow us to move forward in a spirit of harmony and to continue to adapt the Organization to meet the challenges of our time. It is vital that the Organization be provided with the means to better respond to the expectations of the peoples of the world. This is why the Principality supports initiatives aimed at improving the Organization(cid:146)s methods of work and, in particular, those regarding Security Council reform. Enlargement of the Council, in both permanent and non-permanent seats, will strengthen its capacity to contribute to the essential objectives of the maintenance of peace by providing more equitable representation of the diverse regions that compose the international community. The fifteenth International AIDS Conference, held in Thailand last July, once again highlighted the devastation caused by this terrible pandemic as well as its disastrous social consequences. However, the Conference also demonstrated that when international organizations, Governments and civil society agree to work this scourge more effectively. In that struggle, the role of women is crucial. In my country, Her Serene Highness Princess Stephanie, my sister, created and chairs the Fight AIDS Monaco association that gives moral and material support to AIDS patients and their families while promoting information and prevention programmes. together, we can fight For my part, I have expressed the wish that all of the Principality(cid:146)s school children participate in marking a world day for children orphaned by AIDS, to show their solidarity with these vulnerable children whose number could reach 100 million by the year 2010. twenty-sixth special session of Once again this year, my country has been contributing to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which was created following the the General Assembly, the first to be devoted to a disease. We have been providing regular support for the activities of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIAIDS (UNAIDS) since its creation, and I am pleased to announce to strengthen the Programme. We hope that the creation within UNAIDS of the Programme Acceleration Fund will allow us to meet specific needs defined by the recipient States themselves. In effect, we are convinced of the necessity for States to strengthen, on the one hand, their capacities terms of basic social services and adequate sanitation facilities and on the other hand, to pursue public awareness and information campaigns. the Principality has decided financial cooperation with that its in Upon the initiative of His Serene Highness the Sovereign Prince, my father, the Principality of Monaco has always expressed its solidarity to the most underdeveloped populations. We share the concerns of world leaders regarding the adverse impact that the persistence of extreme poverty is having on international security. We shall therefore consider most carefully the elaboration of a new global partnership designed to eliminate hunger and poverty and to advance economic development and social justice, as a continuation to the commitments undertaken at the Millennium Summit and during the Monterrey Conference. Terrorism, unfortunately, has become a daily reality, as is attested to by, among others, the tragedy that took place in Beslan, which is repugnant to all of us. Our determination to fight it must remain unshaken and that is why we welcome the establishment of an executive directorate of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. In that domain, international cooperation is an essential element for effective action. No State, regardless of its size, can be a weak link that might endanger the efforts we are conducting together. Therefore, the Principality intends to play its role in the battle which our Organization is waging against terrorism. Thus, Monaco has become a party to all of the twelve conventions designed to eradicate international terrorism and has adopted, as domestic legislation, appropriate measures for their implementation. But the battle against terrorism also requires that we act irreproachably in terms of our respect for human rights. Accordingly, the Principality is making every effort to guarantee them on its territory; hence Monaco(cid:146)s forthcoming accession to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The number of refugees and displaced persons who are displaced within their own countries continues to increase, and our response to the unbearable suffering of those human beings cannot be limited to our moral indignation. As in any urgent and complex emergency situation, civilians and the most vulnerable among them are the targets of harm and the worst types of abuse. The humanitarian disaster which continues to take place under our very eyes in Darfur has shown, once again, how limited we are in our capacity to enforce respect for human rights and for international humanitarian law. to earmark In response to the appeal launched by the Office the United Nations High Commissioner for of Refugees (UNHCR) during the special session of the General Assembly on children in 2002, the authorities of Monaco decided traditional contribution to UNHCR towards primary education for refugee children. We hope to provide those children, whose world has been brutally shattered overnight, a substitute for their traditional educational environment, by allowing them to escape, albeit a little, those terrible conditions of daily life dominated by promiscuity and the anguish of having forever lost their homes. their in keeping with Championing the interests of the child has always been one of our major concerns. To build a world fit for children, the commitments undertaken during the May 2002 special session on children, the World Association of Children(cid:146)s Friends, presided over by my sister, Her Royal Highness the Princess of Hanover, organized in the Principality in April 2003, subject. Unfortunately, the need is becoming clearer each day, to strengthen the area of international law designed to guarantee the rights of children and to assure that those laws are more effectively applied. table on round a that Thus, do not those particularly heinous crimes require an exceptionally strong response? Do we not need to ensure that the most serious violations of the 23 rights of children do not fall under a statute of limitations and do we not need to extend the powers of the national jurisdictions by providing them with universal competence in that area? The Principality of Monaco urges you to give thought to this, in other words, to plan for the adoption of a legal instrument which will make it possible here, to react against the impunity which continues to prevail, concerning the enrolment of child soldiers, the sexual exploitation of children and the despicable trade of which they are victims (cid:151) to mention only the most revolting of those crimes. to the reaffirm those horrendous The debate held last June in the Security Council served timely nature of such considerations. By abolishing the statute of limitations for crimes, we would be strengthening their prevention, as well as fulfilling our duty to honour the memory of the victims. By expanding national jurisdictions so that borders no longer serve to limit our actions, we will be better able to cope with the development of the transnational organized crime network which defies our States and the legal order they are trying to establish. competences the of our I am fully aware that this essentially moral struggle (cid:151) to ensure respect for the rights of the child (cid:151) gives rise, given the present state of international law, to numerous legal difficulties. But is it not our duty to act when that legislation is no longer adapted to meet the challenges of our time, at a time when the international community is clearly closing its unified ranks, to put an end to those practices which are abhorrent to all of us? foresighted Let us be courageous and in championing the most noble cause that exists (cid:151) the defence of innocents. Let us respond to the appeal of Albert Einstein made so long ago that (cid:151) there will be no progress in this world as long as there are unhappy children. "}}
