Mr. Dra(cid:154)kovic (Serbia and Montenegro) (spoke in Serbian; English text provided by the delegation): Allow me at the outset to convey the greetings and best wishes of the people of my country to Member States and their people, and to the Secretary-General. War, oppression, crime, hatred and suffering plague hundreds of millions of men and women all over the world today. In pursuit of the ideals of peace, democracy and happiness, the United Nations is the united conscience of humankind. In order to achieve the goals of the Millennium Declaration, our Organization must be structurally, economically and spiritually. strengthened that based on Serbia and Montenegro therefore supports both the initiatives for the enlargement of the Security for Council, the need equal representation of all continents, and that which the most developed concedes a special role for countries, without whose support the United Nations would be unable to fulfil its noble goals. The fight against global terrorism in all its manifestations, such as anti-Semitism and anti- Islamism, is our primary responsibility today. Those who perpetrated, masterminded and bankrolled terrorist atrocities in New York, Washington, Moscow, Beslan, Jerusalem, Madrid, Istanbul and other places have not only declared war against all nations, but also against God himself, who is the same God for all people. In the is unavoidable, but prevention is what we need most. terrorism, against force fight 51 Politicians, international religious and spiritual leaders and the media must constantly emphasize that the killing of children and of innocent civilians are crimes that the terrorists are perpetrating against their own religions and nations and that God will neither forgive them nor reward them with paradise for such crimes. Multilateralism is the only means to prevent the catastrophe of and civilizations. At the same time, terrorism must be condemned with equal resolve by everyone. There can be no acceptable terrorists, nor should terrorists be proclaimed as (cid:147)freedom fighters(cid:148) anywhere. clash between faiths the Serbia and Montenegro is a small country that has been confronted with most of the world(cid:146)s current problems and misfortunes. The recent wars that saw the break-up of Yugoslavia (cid:151) one of the founding members of the United Nations (cid:151) have had immense and painful consequences: unemployment; poverty; tragic plight of some 600,000 refugees; hopelessness among young people, which breeds drug dependence; a rising suicide rate; and the desperate position of Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija. the The reality of Kosovo and Metohija today is both dramatic and grim. Over the past five years, the international administration and dominance of the Albanian majority of this Serbian province have led to the killing or abduction of more than 2,500 Serbs, including many children, and to the destruction of 1,500-year-old and approximately 40,000 homes. As a result of terrorism and massive violations of basic human rights, nearly 200,000 Serbs and other non-Albanians have been expelled from Kosovo and Metohija. and monasteries churches The hopes of suffering victims are directed towards the United Nations, particularly its bodies and specialized agencies. I take this opportunity to express my most profound gratitude to the Secretary-General and to the Director-General of UNESCO for the decision to convene, in November, an international donor conference aimed at funding the reconstruction of destroyed churches and monasteries in Kosovo. We are also grateful for the principled position that all homes must be rebuilt, that conditions must be created for the return of all of those who have been expelled and that the Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija must be guaranteed to freedom of movement and all civil, national and religious freedoms. the right life and to 52 The spirit of a united Europe and a united world lives in the hearts of Serbs and Montenegrins. While we respect the existing State borders that we share with our neighbours, we wish to erase them in everyday life and to build a common European future based on dialogue, reconciliation and equality among all nations. We are fully confident that, with the strong support of the United Nations, we will attain that goal. But the insistence by some on the creation of a sovereign State of Kosovo amounts to a call for the break-up of the sovereign State of Serbia and Montenegro. Such an objective breeds new hatred and misery and tenets of international law and to the Charter of the United Nations. We will not agree to the violation of the rights of our State and its citizens. is contrary the basic to By applying consistent standards in addressing all crimes, the United Nations will assist the efforts of the democratic Government in Serbia and Montenegro to fulfil our obligations to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is something we must do. The nation is innocent; responsibility rests on the individual, and none of those who have been indicted for war crimes has the right to hold a nation hostage. All of us on this planet are brothers and sisters. Gens una sumus: we are all one family. Therefore, the primary obligation of any majority, whether religious, racial or ethnic, is to fully protect the rights of that my minorities. I can assure Government to that principle. the Assembly is unreservedly committed "}}
