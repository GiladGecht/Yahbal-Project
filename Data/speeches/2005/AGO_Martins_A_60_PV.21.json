{"speech":{"0":" It is with great honour that I take this floor before this Assembly. At the outset, I should like to congratulate the President, on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Angola, for his election to the presidency of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly of our Organization. I also wish to express my appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, for his commitment and for the transparent and efficient manner in which he presided over the fifty-ninth session of General Assembly. 34 Today, 60 years after the foundation of the United Nations, humanity continues to face new and complex challenges. The continuation of armed conflicts, hunger, poverty, massive human rights violations, the spread of HIAIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, the scar of terrorism and the risk that non-State actors can acquire, develop and use weapons of mass destruction indeed constitute a threat to international peace and security. Therefore, the international community has every reason to reform and strengthen the United Nations in order to render it better prepared to address the many and complex challenges we are facing. to act collectively The Republic of Angola follows with great concern the developments in several areas of the world, particularly on the African continent. In spite of a relatively positive tendency characterized by a decrease in areas of tension in the world today, it is necessary to continue to pay special attention to the peace processes the world, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cote dIvoire, Sudan and Guinea-Bissau, to mention only a few. in various parts of Regarding Guinea-Bissau, my delegation is satisfied with the results achieved, and we commend the political maturity shown by the people of Guinea- Bissau during the transition period, particularly the civic responsibility demonstrated during the period of presidential elections. In this context, we believe that respect for the constitutionally established institutions of sovereignty is an indispensable condition for political stability. Only this will create a propitious environment for the accomplishment the maintenance of peace and economic reconstruction. Such is the expectation of the Guinean people, who went to voting stations in such significant numbers. That is a vote for democracy. guarantee of tasks that In that connection, we welcome the round table on Guinea-Bissau, scheduled the month of November, and we urge donors to respond positively since the international communitys assistance remains a fundamental condition for the process under way. for Regarding the process of consolidation of peace currently in progress in the Great Lakes region, Angola, in its capacity as a core country, is pleased with what has been achieved so far. We thank the Group of Friends, and particularly the Government of Canada, for the support they have been providing, and especially for the second Great Lakes Conference, due to be held next November in Nairobi. and that with regional Although we understand the primary responsibility to prevent and resolve conflicts in Africa falls upon African States themselves, we share the notion that the international community should, in partnership subregional organizations, play a more significant role in the prevention and resolution of conflicts on the continent. Based on our own experience, we believe that in order for strategies for the prevention and resolution of conflicts to be successful, they should be based on an approach that is as inclusive as possible. In this connection, the cooperation of the key organs of the United Nations — the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council — is absolutely essential. The pertinent involvement of the international financial institutions, as well as the private and business sectors, has proven to be equally fundamental. For this reason, we support and welcome the decision of the High-level Meeting to create the Peacebuilding Commission. We are ready to work with partners towards rendering this organ operational as soon as possible. that Angola supports the creation of the permanent fund for the consolidation of peace. We are also of the view disarmament, demobilization and reintegration should be financed from the regular budget and attributed to peacekeeping operations. activities related to While the illicit exploitation of natural resources was not mentioned in the outcome document of the summit, we hope that during the current session of the issue will be given due General Assembly consideration since fundamental element for the strategy of prevention and resolution of conflicts. this it constitutes a Terrorism undoubtedly constitutes a permanent threat to the world that no country can face alone. Therefore, it calls for cooperation among all countries, with the United Nations playing the central role in the fight against it. In this connection, we join the Secretary-Generals plea for the conclusion, as urgently as possible, of the comprehensive convention against international terrorism, which would contain a universally accepted definition of the concept of terrorism. Five years since the adoption of the Millennium Declaration, the social and economic situation in several parts of the globe continues to be characterized by extreme poverty. As well-articulated mentioned by the Secretary- General in his report, “In larger freedom” (), poverty is not only about development; it is also a matter of security and respect for human rights, which are fundamental the Millennium Development Goals. For this reason, I agree with several previous speakers that this issue in the outcome document ought to be dealt with in greater detail. Thus, we look forward to continuing our work in the relevant forums, in particular in a strengthened Economic and Social Council. to The fight against HIAIDS, malaria, illnesses constitutes an tuberculosis and other indispensable condition for peace, stability and international collective security. For this reason, we urge the international community to redouble its efforts in mobilizing the required resources for the prevention and treatment of these illnesses. Let me take this opportunity to express my Governments appreciation to the United States for funding and initiating a programme to fight malaria in Angola, as well as in Tanzania and Uganda. In my delegations opinion, in order to meet the challenges facing the world, it is imperative that we proceed to the reform of the main organs of the United Nations, with a view to adapting them to the current reality. We will remain active in the process of reform of the United Nations, including the Security Council and the other primary bodies of our Organization. We share the opinion that the composition of the Security Council should properly reflect the present day political reality. Enlarging the Security Council would and more representative, with greater credibility and, in particular, greater authority in its decisions. transparent it more render Nevertheless, we would like to underline that the enlargement of the Council is just one aspect of the reform that needs to be completed. We should not underestimate other elements of Council reform that we consider no less important, such as the need to 35 improve and render more transparent its working methods. I am convinced that the results reached at the High-level Plenary Meeting during this session of the General Assembly will stimulate the continuation of the debate on the process of the reform itself. This will create a platform that will reinforce the Organizations common strengthening cooperation and providing greater assurances that international peace and stability can only be found in a reinforced multilateralism. objectives: vision and "}}
