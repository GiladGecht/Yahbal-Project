{"speech":{"0":" I want to make an intervention on the statement you just made, Sir, concerning the reason why item 42 of the provisional agenda was not included in the agenda of the sixtieth session. In that connection, I want to clarify the fact that the time constraint due to the High-level Plenary Meeting was the sole reason that debate on the two Taiwan-related issues was cut short. The limitations on the number of speakers, as well as on the time allocated to each statement as adopted by the General Committee on 13 September, should in no way set a precedent for future debates on those issues. The right of every State Member of the United Nations to raise issues of concern international community should therefore be recognized and reaffirmed. the to I want to call members attention to the fact that the General Committee had actually decided to shorten the debate on the two proposals listed under items 42 and 158 in the provisional agenda regarding the situation in the Taiwan Strait.
