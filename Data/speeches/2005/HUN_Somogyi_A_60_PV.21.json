{"speech":{"0":" Let me start by extending to the President my sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly. I can assure him that in fulfilling his challenging and responsible duties, he will have the support and full cooperation of the delegation of Hungary. Our tribute and thanks are also due to his predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, who served us with exemplary devotion and honour. Effective multilateralism remains an important objective of the foreign policy of Hungary. Therefore, we are pleased to see the United Nations standing ready to face the emerging threats and challenges by making efforts to adapt its activities to the realities of our contemporary world. The United Nations has served for 60 years as the core institution for collective security. In our global and interdependent world we have to acknowledge that development, peace, security and human rights form an indispensable foundation for the security and well- being of our times. terrorism, the fight against My Government is particularly pleased that issues such as international protection of human rights, the proposed Human Rights Council, the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, of United Nations management, as well as challenges to development, have found proper reflection in the recommendations of the summit. related the reform 10 International terrorism continues to be a major threat to our societies. The recently experienced horrors of terror are sowing the seeds of instability all over the world. Hungary, along with its partners in the European Union and NATO, strongly condemns all forms of terrorism. Measures taken in the course of combating terrorist forces, however, must always remain international standards, in particular with human rights and refugee and humanitarian law. We believe that the United Nations needs to accord top priority to the fight against the scourge of terrorism. My country is keen to see the elaboration and adoption by the General Assembly of a comprehensive convention on terrorism, which would, among others things, give the proper legal definition of terrorist acts. in conformity with basic Freedom, democracy and human rights should constitute the basic framework of life for every individual. We know from experience that they are not granted automatically; they must be won and enforced through hard and persistent efforts. It is of paramount that essential human rights- importance related activities, such as servicing treaty implementation machinery or monitoring undertaken by the special procedures, are given their due share in the funding provisions of the United Nations regular budget. therefore the Driven by the objective to promote democracy in the world, the Government of the Republic of Hungary has established the Budapest International Center for Democratic Transition. The Center is set to provide assistance for democratic reforms drawing upon the experience of countries that have recently undergone political, economic and social transition. These nations, having had to face and address the challenges of transition in the recent past, can probably best serve as helping hands to countries in need in this regard. It is in the same spirit that Hungary warmly welcomes the establishment of the United Nations Democracy Fund. The Budapest International Center for Democratic Transition will be eager to coordinate its activities with the Fund in the framework of a close cooperative relationship. Hungary finds the resolution to establish a new United Nations mechanism dealing with the rights of persons belonging to national, ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities to be highly encouraging. The appointment of an independent expert on minority issues is an important step in the right direction. The United Nations however still has a long way to go in meeting the full scope of its responsibilities with regard to the international protection of minority rights. Educating young generations about the lessons of the past is an essential tool to combat discrimination and intolerance. For this reason a day of Holocaust remembrance has been introduced into Hungarian school curriculum. It is in that same spirit that Hungary supports the proposal to place Holocaust remembrance on the agenda in the United Nations General Assembly. Hungary recognizes that development is a central goal by itself and is ready to reaffirm its commitment to sustainable development and global prosperity for all. As a new European Union member, Hungary to gradually increase her official development assistance. The European Union important decisions in support of Africas development efforts. We reaffirm our commitment to contribute urgently to meeting the special needs of that continent. eradicate poverty recently made and promote ready is We are encouraged to see that after so many years of wars and violence, democratic changes are bearing fruit for the peoples of the Western Balkans. It is more than promising the political and economic perspectives offered by the European Union and NATO are the main driving forces today for the countries of this region. that in their broader In order to find lasting solutions to the yet unresolved challenges of the Western Balkans, it is crucial to tackle the basic issues of security and stability regional dimensions. Regardless of its future status, it is vital that Kosovo be transformed into a viable entity, capable of exercising firm administrative control with a stable law and order situation and a transparent, dependable economy. Given the turbulent history of the Balkans, no long- is conceivable without establishing term solution harmonious inter-ethnic relationships. Well-defined and strictly the implemented minority rights are primary precondition for peace, stability and prosperity both in Kosovo and in the broader Western Balkans. The Middle East conflict has wide-ranging implications on global peace and security, on the prospects of the world economy and, last but not least, on the fight against international terrorism. Hungary is of the firm view that the road map, based on the two- States principle, still gives us the best chance for reaching a just and lasting solution. The implementation of the Gaza disengagement plan by the Government of Israel has been a step of truly historic proportions. Thus, the Middle East peace process has been given a new lease on life, but its sustainability is subject to further consistent, bold measures by both sides. In order to maintain the momentum, Israel needs to return to the road map, while to demonstrate its own commitment to the peace process by carrying out the long overdue internal reforms and, most importantly, by eradicating terrorism and taking the law and order situation under effective control. the Palestinian National Authority has and process reconstruction The continued instability in Iraq is a matter of grave concern. Hungary strongly condemns the acts of violence and terrorism in Iraq, which aim to undermine the political normalization. In spite of the alarming security situation and the obvious internal instability, the political transition in Iraq is making progress in line with Security Council resolution 1546 (2004). The approval of is indispensable to carry on the political process. Further consistent efforts are required to properly engage all Iraqi communities in building a united, stable and democratic country. recently drafted constitution of the Let me reiterate Hungarys continued commitment to provide assistance to the people of Iraq in their efforts to build a democratic and prosperous country that will soon take its due place in the family of democratic nations. Hungary viewed the successful presidential elections last October as an important milestone on the way to political stabilization in Afghanistan. The parliamentary elections held only days ago marked a further major step leading to the establishment of proper democratic institutions in that country. Hungary is proud of the humanitarian assistance it has provided to the people of Afghanistan, as well as of the contribution it has made to facilitate the process of political stabilization. My country is ready to undertake further commitments in order to assist the Afghan people in rebuilding their country in peace and security. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction along with their means of delivery continues to undermine international peace and security. The threat 11 that terrorist groups and non-State actors will acquire nuclear, biological and chemical weapons is a major concern to us all. At the last session of the General Assembly, Hungary expressed its strong support for the full implementation of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004), and called on all States to establish effective national export controls. We have noted with satisfaction that a great number of Member States had submitted comprehensive reports on their national measures serving the resolution. the aim and purpose of The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is still a cornerstone of international peace, security and stability. The 2005 NPT Review Conference, however, failed to our expectations. The international community needs to fulfil its responsibility in preserving the integrity of the Treaty while promoting its universal character. live up to Recognizing the grave threat posed by biological weapons, Hungary will work together with other nations in the run-up to the upcoming Biological and Toxic Weapons Review Conference. Hungary will strive the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. to explore opportunities to strengthen My country remains committed to the Ottawa Convention banning landmines. We will have destroyed all equipment under the provisions of the Convention by the end of 2005, well in advance of the deadline. At the current session, beyond the wide range of issues to be tackled, we have to make important decisions to put on track the implementation of the outcome document adopted by the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly. If we are guided by a sense of common responsibility and firmly anchored realism, the momentum for reform will be maintained. The delegation of Hungary stands ready to work in partnership with other delegations to make this happen. "}}
