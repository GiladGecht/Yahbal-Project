{"speech":{"0":" First, Sir, I should like to extend my sincere congratulations to you on the occasion of your election to the presidency of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly and to wish you the greatest success in conducting the work of the Assembly. I am also pleased to take this opportunity to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Gabonese Republic, for the considerable results produced during his term as President, especially towards the end of the session, when we the to offer my sincere reviewed matters related thanks to in implementation of the Millennium Goals and the reform of the United Nations. I should also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his valuable efforts to bolster and propel the role of the United Nations in international peacekeeping, security and development. The report by Mr. Kofi Annan () and the recommendations set out in it provide us with important elements capable of leading to consensus on strategies that will help us to achieve the Millennium Goals and to make progress on reforming the United Nations. I cannot fail to take advantage of this opportunity, on behalf of the people of Sao Tome and Principe, to reiterate to the Government and the people of the United States of America and to the bereaved families our sincere condolences regarding the tragedy caused by Hurricane Katrina. These difficult times, being experienced by a large part of the American people, cannot leave us indifferent, above all because we are fully aware of the role that the American people and its Government play international solidarity and cooperation, constantly seeking peace and prosperity for peoples in difficulty, and of their support and financing of this great Organization. From the early days of the signing of the Charter in 1945 in San Francisco, the United Nations has played a crucial role in undertaking many matters of a political, economic, social and humanitarian nature throughout the world. Nevertheless, it seems to us that the world now needs a stronger and more dynamic United Nations. The present session takes place in a very complex international environment. Indeed, the climate of permanent tension experienced in some parts of the world, the unbridled arms race, human trafficking, cross-border organized crime, terrorism, systematic violations of human rights, economic depression and environmental degradation constitute important matters that are in need of the attention of the United Nations now and in the years to come. In the face of such challenges, Member States must manifest a sense of wisdom and responsibility in order for an international order based on peace, security and cooperation to prevail. Small island States met this year in Mauritius to evaluate the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. their In Mauritius, reaffirmed States 13 to lead that would thanks both to express our commitment to support the efforts of small island developing States to sustainable development through a greater and more effective implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action. Decisions and recommendations were adopted on climate change, natural and environmental disasters, water resources, waste management, tourism, energy, transportation, biodiversity and marine and coastal resources. All the problems that affect small island States, from global warming to ecosystem problems, can be resolved only if the international community makes an effort to effectively increase the resources that will support the sustained development of small island States. In this regard, we would like to take the opportunity the international community and to the Government of Mauritius for the efforts made to organize the special conference. International security is based on the protection of the people and on education for capacity-building, promoting a communitys development. Nations that do not pay attention those factors could be in a state of permanent tension, which is not conducive to progress. For this reason HIAIDS, poverty, political crises, ongoing violations of human rights, oppression and occupation constitute threats to human security. Many of our countries continue to face challenges in combating HIAIDS and other illnesses. In some regions of Africa HIAIDS is devastating families, cultures and economies — entire societies. The cost of treatment continues to be extremely high and our economies are beginning to buckle under the effects of the illness. If significant resources and additional scientific investment for research to seek a cure for HIAIDS are not the development expectations of Africa will be far from being met. the Republic of Angola was attacked by the worst outbreak ever of Marburg fever, caused by a virus related to the Ebola virus. We are concerned because Sao Tome and Principe, being an integral part of the Central African States, cannot remove itself from that situation. We appeal to the World Health Organization (WHO) to strengthen the capabilities of the countries of the subregion by holding seminars and providing training. This initiative will help us to deal prophylactically with similar situations that might arise. Likewise, malaria continues to be a serious public health problem for my country existing despite involvement with Very recently forthcoming active its to its causes, and the elderly. Terrorism the origins of then programmes supported by several countries and organizations. The situation of insecurity primarily affects the refugees, most vulnerable populations, especially is children, women and lives and destabilizing Governments, destroying claiming innocent victims. We are faced with a challenge that requires reformulating our strategies to combat it. It seems entirely appropriate to start with an the problem by understanding of identifying forge new consensuses and improve the methods of combating the problem and implementing Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). However, the United Nations must take additional action to benefit States which, like my own, are not in a position to fully comply with all the provisions of that resolution. We need resources that will contribute to the improvement, inter alia, of our security, including control of our borders and territorial waters. Here, strengthening our capability to fight the phenomenon of terrorism is a priority. In my capacity as President of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, I should like to refer to Guinea-Bissau, which has successfully concluded a long and difficult political transition. First, let me congratulate the people and the authorities of that country on the international community, and in particular the United Nations and its Secretary-General, for its prompt contribution, which bolstered the peoples action for peace, stability and development. Now, Guinea-Bissau faces the giant task of promoting development and well-being international community must therefore continue to provide its traditional help so that legitimate expectations may not be frustrated. The universality of the Organization requires that all nations must be this continues not to be so despite several calls for it. As we reflect on reforming the United Nations, we must once again take advantage of the opportunity from this rostrum to invite the international community to review the problem of the need for the Republic of China on Taiwan to be represented in the Organization. In this regard, my country signed the letter contained in document requesting the inclusion of an item in the agenda of the present session entitled “Question of the representation of the 23 million people of represented. However, its population. The their success. I commend just for 14 joined Taiwan in the United Nations”. Once again, we have lost an opportunity to correct this injustice. We are further concerned by the recent adoption by the Peoples Republic of China of the so-called anti- secession law, which, by increasing tension in the Strait of Taiwan, may compromise peace in the region. Aware of the role of the United Nations, specifically under the provisions of Articles 1 and 34 of the Charter, Sao Tome and Principe also in proposing the draft resolution annexed to document . That document contains a letter requesting the inclusion of a supplementary item in the agenda of the present session entitled, “A proactive role for the United Nations in maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait”. Neither proposal received the expected support. We are faced with an excellent opportunity to infuse our Organization with greater dynamism and rationality, more action and less bureaucracy. Reform of the system is urgent. It is a high priority. To that end, we must all work without hesitation for the good of the world to which we belong. the General the President of the Assembly, I wish Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe for the statement he has just made.
