{"speech":{"0":" My delegation wishes to refer to document and to register its disappointment in the manner in which the General Committee discussed the issue of the agenda. Solomon Islands, among other countries, was actually denied the opportunity to debate the inclusion of certain items on the agenda, and feels that the United Nations must at least have a mechanism in place to provide for the full and equal participation of all Member States. the Chair to Rulings by limit speakers on provisional agenda item 56 in the current working paper and item 60 denied the right of Member States to speak on the issue. In that regard, Solomon Islands feels that the principles of democracy and universality were not respected. Those principles should not be challenged, but rather protected and upheld. At times, my delegation feels, the Secretariat tends to dictate and impose on States, putting on paper rules that restrict countries from presenting indirectly marginalizing them from the process that they should be part of. their views, My delegation feels that, so long as we take such an approach, this Assembly will pick and choose which threats to discuss and which to sweep under the carpet. Solomon Islands hopes that the approach taken by the General Committee this year in discussing the two items must not and should not set a precedent for future General Committee working methods. I wish to close by assuring you, Sir, of Solomon Islands continued support during your term in office. "}}
