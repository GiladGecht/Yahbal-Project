{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, I would like, on behalf of the Vietnamese delegation, sincerely to congratulate Mr. Jan Eliasson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session. I am convinced that under his able stewardship this session will be crowned with success. Let me express our deep appreciation the contributions made by his predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, to the work of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his great efforts over the past year to reform and strengthen our Organization. for Taking place in the context of the many activities commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations — especially the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly that just concluded — the present session constitutes an event of crucial significance that offers us a great deal of hope and confidence. We believe that Member States will be able to work out effective ways in which to implement the commitments contained in the outcome document (resolution ) just adopted by our leaders, especially those the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We are confident that, amid both challenges and opportunities and with the necessary wisdom and determination, we will find the right path towards a brighter future for humanity in the twenty-first century. implementation concerning the of Polands commitments in the framework of the United Nations are not made based on tactical considerations. We are not calculating what we can gain from this or that choice. We do not expect to make political profits or economic gains. But we share a sense of solidarity and responsibility with respect not only to our own country but also to the entire international community. A system based on values and principles may not be perfect, but it is likely to be more peaceful and, in 20 In todays celebratory atmosphere, we cannot and should not forget stark realities as we continue to see the spread of war and conflict, the resurgence of terrorism, natural disasters, poverty, the outbreak of epidemics are threatening the peace, security, independence and prosperity of nations. The people of the world were shocked by the recent terrorist attacks in London, in Sharm el-Sheikh and elsewhere. Viet Nam therefore joins with others in the fight against terrorism of all crime, which transnational and kinds. It is our view that, in order to root out terrorism, the international community must seriously and adequately address the phenomena of poverty, injustice and inequality. the Viet Nam welcomes recent positive developments in the Middle East peace process. It is our consistent policy to support the just cause of the Palestinian people in their struggle for their inalienable rights. In that connection, we welcome Israels withdrawal from resettlement areas in the Gaza Strip. Proceeding from that international disputes should be settled by peaceful means, Viet Nam supports peaceful solutions to the nuclear issue in Iran and on the Korean peninsula. its principled position Considering embargoes and blockades to be unacceptable in the modern world, we call for the early lifting of the unilateral embargo against Cuba. It is Viet Nams view that the United Nations should be more active in that connection. The tsunami that affected Asian countries last year and Hurricane Katrina, which hit coastal cities of the United States, both resulting in the loss of a great number of lives and damage worth hundreds of billions of dollars, are reminders of the need for effective early warning systems, preparedness and international solidarity in confronting the forces of nature. interactive As we are preparing to translate the commitments contained in the outcome document into action to reform the United Nations, I would like to associate myself with the views expressed by the Secretary- General in his report “In larger freedom” () and reaffirmed in the outcome document concerning the security, development and human rights. Viet Nams experience shows that an environment of peace and political and social stability is indispensable for development and that economic growth, the improvement of peoples lives, will help to strengthen peace and stability. In that regard, we believe the United Nations should play a greater role in making those links more interactive. among links peace, Viet Nam shares the common view that reform of the United Nations should aim, first and foremost, at enhancing the Organizations efficiency and democracy on fundamental principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. It is essential to reinforce the central role and power of the General Assembly, a body that stipulates the equal the basis of strengthening the participation of all United Nations Members. Reform of the Security Council should be accorded adequate attention, so that the Council can be turned into a body that is able to perform its functions in maintaining international peace and security effectively. The Councils working methods should be improved to ensure democracy and transparency. The Council needs to be enlarged in both categories of its membership in order to ensure that it truly represents all United Nations Members, as stipulated in the Charter. We believe that developing States should be more adequately represented in that important organ. We would like to reiterate the support we have expressed since 1999 for India, Japan and Germany as permanent members of an expanded Council. be carried Furthermore, Viet Nam believes that reform of the United Nations must out comprehensively and in a way that ensures a balance between the two equally important and mutually complementary goals of maintaining peace and security and promoting development. An enabling environment for development must be built on the basis of equitable international economic relations, mutual benefit, shared responsibility and the fulfilment of agreed commitments. in their gross national the commitments contained In that spirit, Viet Nam supports the proposals on development set out in the report of the Secretary- General and the outcome document, especially the recommitment of the international community to achieving the MDGs on schedule. Viet Nam welcomes the commitment on the part of some developed countries to allocate 0.7 per cent of to official development assistance without any conditions. If developing nations are to achieve the MDGs, it is essential that they be enabled to participate more actively in the global economy. Viet Nam therefore calls on the United Nations to adopt and implement measures to facilitate the entry of developing countries into the World Trade Organization. Moreover, non- tariff and other protective measures aimed at blocking exports from developing countries, under such pretexts as sanitary and phytosanitary standards, should be dismantled. income Guaranteeing and promoting human rights always remain high priorities in the work of the United Nations. Viet Nam supports a greater role for the Organization in that regard. We will continue to spare no effort in contributing to the common cause of 21 human rights protection. Mindful of the need to reform the United Nations machinery for protecting human rights, we believe that reform must be conducted in a manner that is free from acts of politicization. More in-depth discussions are needed with regard to the issue of establishing a Human Rights Council and the concept of the responsibility to protect, so as to ensure broad support for the measures to be implemented. The Vietnamese people have just celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of their democratic State. Having gone through a process of comprehensive renewal, Viet Nam today is a country with high and sustained economic growth and social equity, and we have made significant progress in implementing the MDGs. Today, Viet Nam is a safe and stable country that has further integrated into the global economy and independence, has pursued a sovereignty strengthening multilateral ties in its external relations. It is a country that is willing to be a friend and a reliable partner of all countries of the world community. foreign policy of diversification, and to thanks those countries We have actively participated in various regional, interregional and global cooperation arrangements. Viet Nam has been making great efforts to conclude negotiations for its early accession to the World Trade Organization. I would like to take this opportunity to extend our that have supported Viet Nam in that connection. We are actively engaged in the cooperation activities of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), as well as with ASEAN cooperation with East Asia. To make a greater contribution to the work of the United Nations, Viet Nam has decided to present its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the 2008-2009 term. We are now actively preparing to participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations when conditions are ripe. To conclude, let me assure the Assembly that Viet Nam will continue to work closely with other countries in the international community to strive for our common goals, among them a stronger United Nations.
