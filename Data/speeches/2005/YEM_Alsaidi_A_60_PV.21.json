{"speech":{"0":" The Government of the Republic of Yemen believes that the principles of the Charter of the United Nations form the cornerstone of its ability to tackle all problems at the national, regional and international levels. Ever since it was created, it has strived to create a climate of security and stability in the region by demarcating Yemens land and sea borders by peaceful means and by its devotion to the principle of well-balanced diplomacy and dialogue in the settlement of its disputes with others. It has fostered a partnership with neighbouring countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Sana community for development, as well as its active contribution to the League of Arab States. Yemen has played a pioneering role with regard to political reform and the multiparty system and has enabled women to participate actively in the political, economic and social life of the country. Yemen is in the process of preparing for direct presidential elections, as well as elections for local administrative councils, in order to enhance democracy and promote peoples participation in the administration of the country and in achieving decentralization by next September. 23 Yemen would like to thank the international development agency for its support in this connection, as well as those States that have supported our democracy. We hope, however, that we will be receiving more financial and technical support for the high electoral commission to enable it to efficiently carry out its work. settlers who were evacuated, as territories occupied by force, or have any sympathy for Israeli these settlements were built on land the settlers did not own. Israel should end its occupation of the West Bank, remove all settlements the separation wall the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice. there, and demolish in accordance with to develop ways In light of terrorist acts in a number of countries of the region and throughout the world, the Republic of Yemen wishes to reaffirm its clear-cut position that there is a need to have joint responsibility in our struggle against terrorism. We will cooperate with all States and international organizations to deal with this danger and for exchanging information, particularly with regard to the sources of financing for terrorism and the prosecution of the guilty parties. We firmly believe that we should convene an international conference on terrorism to arrive at a clear definition of the phenomenon, which would draw a distinction between terrorism and the right of peoples to self-determination and to resist foreign occupation of territories. We also condemn all forms of terrorism against innocent and defenceless civilians. their and peace international The expansion of poverty and diseases and the lack of education and health services for millions of people in Africa and Asia constitutes a time bomb threatening security. Establishing peace and stability and putting an end to extremism and terrorism are goals that cannot be achieved unless rich States revise their economic and political policies and provide support to achieve peace and development. That would enable millions of people to recover their dignity and humanity. In this context, the Republic of Yemen wishes to reaffirm its support for the proposal made by the King of Saudi Arabia, Guardian of the Two Holy Sites, for the creation of an international centre to fight terrorism. The Republic of Yemen is of the view that the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from the Gaza Strip is a first step on a long path. We reaffirm our belief that this withdrawal is but a part of the road map that integrated comprehensive plan that must be implemented as a whole and not dealt with selectively. should be considered an as In this context, the international community should not be deceived into believing that Israel has made enormous sacrifices by withdrawing from 24 The peace process is an indivisible whole. Real peace can only be achieved when all Arab rights have been recovered â€” first and foremost, the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied territories in Palestine, the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon to the borders of 4 June 1967, the creation of an independent Palestinian State on Palestinian national soil with its capital in Al-Quds Al-Sharif, and the just resolution of the refugee problem in accordance with General Assembly resolution 194 (III) of 1949. We ask the international Organization and the Quartet not to recognize nor accept any Israeli guarantees or promises that are designed the Palestinian people and its sovereignty and not to reward Israeli occupation that seeks to impose faits accomplis solutions. legitimate rights of to violate the We must carefully consider the situation in Iraq and see what we can do to assist the Iraqi people to achieve its aspirations. There is no doubt that respect for the unity, sovereignty and independence of Iraq, non-interference in its internal affairs, respect for the will of the people of Iraq and their choices in determining their future, are important tasks that this international Organization, as well as the international community, must help and support. The same is true with regard to the need for all sectors of Iraqi society to take part in the political process on the basis of conciliation harmony, without jeopardizing Iraqs Arab identity, civilization and heritage. In this context, the people and Government of Yemen welcome the positive and important role taken by the United Nations in support of the constructive political process. It is important for this international Organization to play a central role in order to help complete this process and that of the reconstruction of Iraq. national and In the same vein, I reiterate the need to urgently implement Security Council resolution 1546 (2004) in order to allow Iraq to recover its full sovereignty and to put an end to the foreign military presence in that country. The Republic of Yemen is following with satisfaction the positive events that are occurring in Sudan, which we see as the beginning of a new stage of national reconciliation, peace and stability in the entire country and as the end of the longest conflict in Africa. We appreciate the role played by neighbouring Arab and African States, as well as that by Secretary- General Kofi Annan, for their help in achieving agreement to ensure Sudans territorial integrity, unity, stability and security. We hope that the international Organization will redouble its efforts to make sure that international financial institutions, funds and States support the process of peace, development and reconstruction throughout Sudan, particularly in the regions that have been ravaged by war. the Government We are pleased to see progress achieved in Somalia. However, we warn of the possibility of further setbacks in that country. We have no choice but to call upon the United Nations and the international community as a whole to provide urgently needed assistance to the transitional Government in Somalia to enable its work, particularly with regard to ensuring reconstruction and the rule of law. The participation of United Nations peacekeeping forces has become more necessary now than ever before. Any reluctance in providing such assistance to Somalia will mean that terrorism and the forces of violence and extremism will prevail with most serious consequences to that country, to the Arab world, regionally and internationally. to carry out With regard to my countrys position on developing national capabilities in the area of the peaceful use of nuclear energy, we believe that all member States of the International Atomic Energy Agency have their nuclear capabilities for peaceful purposes, a position that was adopted by the Islamic States at the meeting of foreign ministers of Islamic Conference, held in Sanaa last June. the Organization of to develop the right the We further reaffirm the importance of making the Middle East a zone free of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction and that the prohibition of such weapons should apply to all States of the region, including Israel. In conclusion, allow me once more to congratulate you, Mr. President, and express my best wishes to the General Assembly, hoping that our common endeavour will be crowned with success so that we can achieve peace, security and prosperity for everyone.
