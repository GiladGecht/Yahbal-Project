{"speech":{"0":"154)kovic, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia and Montenegro. translation Mr. Dra(cid:154)kovic (Serbia and Montenegro) (spoke in Serbian; English the delegation): Seven days ago, from this rostrum, I warned that the situation in Kosovo and Metohija (cid:151) a province of Serbia administered by the United Nations since 10 June 1999 (cid:151) poses a serious threat to the furnished by 19 stability of the Balkans. Serbia and Montenegro supports the conclusion of the International Contact Group that there will be no return to the situation before 10 June 1999. I would like to recall that, before 1999, the regime in Serbia insisted on the limited autonomy of Kosovo, while the Albanian political leaders insisted on its independence. Those two opposing positions led to an armed conflict, and later to NATO air strikes against Serbia and Montenegro. That conflict ended following the adoption of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), which called for a protectorate in Kosovo but did not call into question the territorial integrity of Serbia and Montenegro. less I have to note Unfortunately, than autonomy but The Contact Group(cid:146)s conclusion that there will be no return to the situation before June 1999 has to apply equally to both sides (cid:151) Serbian and Albanian. Consequently, there can be neither limited autonomy nor independence for Kosovo. By proposing a status that was greater than independence for Kosovo, the democratic Government in Belgrade demonstrated its full commitment to reaching a compromise solution. Unfortunately, the Kosovo Albanians, only interested in independence, have not budged an inch from their 1999 position. that the international community is partly to blame for the tragic position the Serbian and other non-Albanian minorities in Kosovo find themselves in, as well as for the political extremism of the Albanian majority and the many crimes that have been committed. The standards set for Kosovo are not even close to being fulfilled. Are we therefore going to abandon the (cid:147)Standards before Status(cid:148) policy? From 10 June 1999 to the present, approximately 200,000 Serbs and Montenegrins, as well as Turks, Croats, Roma, Jews and other non-Albanians, have been expelled from Kosovo. Close to 80 per cent of the territory is now inhabited only by Albanians. Several hundred Serbs have children. Approximately 40,000 Serbian homes have been demolished or set on fire, as well as 150 churches and monasteries that were centuries old. The remaining Serbs and other non-Albanians in so-called enclaves, without guarantees for their personal safety and their freedom of movement. No one in present-day Europe is so tragically unprotected. including many been killed, live 20 In spite the foregoing, we hope that the United Nations military and police forces will remain in Kosovo. Without their presence, the tragedy of Serbs and other minorities would be complete. Troops from the United States, Italy, France and other countries should be given credit for keeping the Serbian Christian monasteries designated or nominated as international world heritage sites from being blown up or set on fire. We would like to thank the United Nations and ask the United Nations forces to stay in Kosovo as long as necessary. and Serbs, Montenegrins For months now, Albanian extremists have been openly threatening to launch a pogrom against the remaining other non-Albanians (cid:151) and even against United Nations forces (cid:151) unless Kosovo(cid:146)s independence is proclaimed. Recent killings of young Serbs announced the beginning of that scenario. Ultimatums and threats to commit crimes and terrorism cannot be accepted anywhere in the world, including in Kosovo. I hope that that will finally and decisively be made clear to the Albanian majority in the province. Serbia and Montenegro demands a European level of human rights protection in Kosovo, protection of churches and monasteries and recognition of the European status of the existing State borders with the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Albania. No more and no less is acceptable, either under the Charter of the United Nations or under Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). Our rights do not threaten any right of the Albanian majority. An independent State of Kosovo is not a guaranteed right, but an extreme demand. for national communities We are truly and fully committed to a compromise, but compromise does not mean that one side gets everything while the other side gets nothing. We are for reconciliation and a common European future, in which Serbs, Montenegrins and Albanians will be good neighbours and best friends for each other. A stable and European Kosovo means a stable Western Balkans region, and vice versa. The choice is obvious. "}}
