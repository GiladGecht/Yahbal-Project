{"speech":{"0":" Let me begin by congratulating you, Madam President, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. I am especially pleased to see a woman in this important position after a break of nearly 30 years. I join those who have expressed thanks to the Secretary- General for his leadership and commitment in recent years in addressing the very serious challenges facing the international community. 13 to take to its those countries Allow me also The commitment that have committed to global partnership this opportunity the Republic of Montenegro on congratulate accession to membership of the United Nations. for development is a timely, yet sobering, theme in light of the long road we have still to travel and the setbacks already encountered. A major setback has been the crisis in global trade talks. Trade can be the single most important vehicle for global development, and we should not let the opportunity presented to us by the Doha Development Agenda slip from our grasp. We must ensure that gains from trade liberalization benefit the poor and are fairly distributed. Iceland remains strongly committed to the Agenda. Many developing countries, particularly in sub- Saharan Africa, have little chance of achieving the Millennium Development Goals by the target date, resources are made unless significant additional available. We welcome and support international efforts for debt relief to the poorest countries. We also applaud to increasing official development assistance. Iceland is also shouldering its responsibility. Over the next three years Icelands development assistance will have almost tripled in size, and we are determined to do even more. Beyond 2009 our assistance should increase even further, with the ambition of reaching the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income. The global partnership rests on the principles of transparency, accountability, good governance, equity and commitment to poverty reduction. Iceland also attaches special importance to the rights of women and children. As the Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner, Shirin Ebadi, so rightly pointed out in her Nobel Peace Prize Lecture on 10 December 2003, “To disregard women and bar them from active participation in political, social, economic and cultural life would in fact be tantamount to depriving the entire population of every society of half its capability.” We want to see more determined efforts by development partners and United Nations agencies to pursue gender equality. The work of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) must be given more weight within the United Nations. Iceland has increased its support for the work of UNIFEM At relate the to least half of if we cannot safeguard more than tenfold over the past two years, and we will increase our support even further. The mission statement of the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) correctly insists that the survival, protection and development of children are central to human progress. Nobody questions this statement, yet more than 10 million children die from preventable causes every year. Iceland will further increase its contributions to the vital work of UNICEF. I am proud to say that the people of Iceland have been particularly active and make the highest contribution per capita of national societies to UNICEF. eight Millennium Development Goals resource use and environmental conservation, that is, to sustainable development. We will not be able to eradicate extreme poverty or hunger the environment, the basis of food security around the world. We cannot hope to reduce child mortality unless we deal with the contamination of fresh water. There is a close relationship between the health of the earths ecosystem and human welfare, security and peace. Icelanders base their livelihood on the living resources of the sea and abundant renewable energy. Iceland rose from relatively recent poverty to affluence through the innovations and by application of drawing on are convinced that our success could be replicated in many other parts of the world, given the right incentives and an enabling environment. In this connection, I should like to refer in particular to two areas of sustainable development: ocean issues and energy issues. issues have far-reaching development implications. Ninety-five per cent of those who make their living from fisheries are in the developing world. A billion people depend on fisheries for their main intake of protein. At the same time, we are seeing a rapid increase in pollution of the ocean and depletion of its living resources. That is why Iceland has prioritized this area in its development cooperation and in the work of the fisheries department of the United Nations University in Iceland. Energy issues also loom large. While Icelanders enjoy the good fortune of having clean, renewable energy for 70 per cent of our total energy use, energy issues are increasingly becoming one of the main drivers of the sustainable development agenda within cooperation. We technological international Ocean 14 today is example to square in promoting the United Nations. Two billion people lack access to electricity. All eight Millennium Development Goals will require greater energy consumption. Unfortunately, more energy consumption in most cases means greater greenhouse gas emissions. One of our greatest challenges the development circle, to meet our development needs while safeguarding the environment. One way certainly is to increase substantially the share of renewables in world energy demand. That is why Iceland is taking an active part renewables and new technologies through its development cooperation and the work of the geothermal department of the United Nations University. Another our commitment in this area is the international seminar on hydrogen use for the developing world, to be held in Reykjavik later this week. It will be co-hosted by Iceland and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Much has been achieved over the past 12 months in implementing the outcome of the World Summit. In this connection, I join others in expressing appreciation for the outstanding work done by Jan Eliasson as President of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session. We now have a Peacebuilding Commission. The new Human Rights Council has also been established. It is the duty of all of us to make sure that we strengthen its credibility and turn it into a powerful defender and reinforcer of basic human rights. Its credibility will depend to a large extent on its even- handedness. Useful work has already been done on internal reform of the United Nations. The success of these reforms — I think in particular of the mandate review — will affect the long-term credibility of the United Nations. It is with great interest and high hopes that we await the outcome of the work of the High- level Panel on System-wide Coherence. to implementing a global partnership for development. In the face of the crippling effects of terrorism, we welcome the Global Counter- Terrorism Strategy. In the fight against terrorism, human rights must not be compromised; otherwise, we undermine the values that we seek to defend. Torture cannot be justified. As we have seen recently, years of careful development can be reversed almost overnight by war. Conflict prevention, restraint by the parties the agreement on fundamental Peace and security is of body charged with maintaining involved and a commitment by other actors to urge restraint, rather than encourage conflict, are also fundamental to the partnership. Sixty years ago, on 19 November 1946, Iceland became a Member of the United Nations. Iceland has since then strongly supported the principles of the United Nations as written in the Charter. With the full support of the other Nordic countries — Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden — Iceland decided in 1998 to present for the first time its candidature for a seat on the Security Council for the period 2009-2010, with elections to be held in 2008. This candidature, which was declared within the Western European and Others Group in April 2000, is based on our readiness to shoulder the responsibility of serving on the United Nations and strengthening peace and security. As one of the almost 100 smaller States of the United Nations, Iceland makes every endeavour to cultivate mutually beneficial relations with all Members of the Organization and believes itself to be favourably positioned to exercise with fairness and firmness the role of a Security Council member. The task of building a global partnership for development is not easy. But it is the only way in which we can realistically address the challenges facing us, whether they be challenges of poverty, security, the environment or health. As Secretary- General Kofi Annan has put it, “the cause of larger freedom can only be advanced by broad, deep and sustained States”. (, para. 18). "}}
