{"speech":{"0":" First of all, I would like to congratulate you, Madam, on your election to your high office and express confidence that, under your skilful stewardship, the sixty-first session of the General Assembly will be successful and fruitful. Last years World Summit reaffirmed the role of the United Nations as an indispensable and universal forum for taking important action on todays burning issues. The Summits decision to carry out United Nations reform, the most radical in its history, is a case in point. We are now in a position to give a preliminary assessment of the work in that area. The results, unfortunately, are mixed. On the one hand, helpful decisions have been to establish new elective bodies within taken the United Nations system — the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council. They were set up thanks to the intensive efforts of all delegations, which were able to reach a compromise through negotiations. On the other hand, the lack of any progress on the issue of reforming the work of the General Assembly and is seriously impeding the institutional reform of the Organization. In our view, further delays in that process might have a negative impact on the United the Security Council 29 the Conference on Nations efforts in the areas of international stability, security and development. For the delegation of Kazakhstan, the current session is, in a way, an anniversary session. We are taking part in the work of this forum for the fifteenth time. While consistently advancing its national interests in the international arena, my country is firmly committed to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. The establishment in Asia of a mechanism of cooperation to enhance regional security and stability, known as Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia (CICA), was one of Kazakhstans first initiatives, put forward from this rostrum in 1992. We can safely claim that the initiative has proved its viability and has become an important factor of international relations at this juncture, as evidenced by the outcome of the second CICA Summit, held in Kazakhstan last June. The documents adopted by CICA, such as the Catalogue of Confidence-building Measures and the Agreement on the Establishment of the CICA Secretariat, have created propitious conditions for regional cooperation and multilateral dialogue in Asia. for an enhanced nuclear-weapons non-proliferation regime. That position is rooted in the sufferings of our people, who are still reeling from the negative effects of nuclear explosions at the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground, shut down exactly 15 years ago by decree of President Nursultan Nazarbayev. The position was bolstered by the historic decision of my country to voluntarily renounce its nuclear arsenal, which used to be the fourth largest in the world. We want that step to serve as a commendable example in the light of the ongoing large-scale crisis that has struck the global security system. Regrettably, the lack of any result at the last Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the United Nations Disarmament Commission remains a major challenge for the international community. It is time to make coordinated efforts to overcome that crisis. The process to that end has already made a good start. The Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia, in Semipalatinsk, is a demonstration of the political will of five Central Asian States: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan has consistently called signed on 8 September are to and ready the vertical Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The signing of that milestone instrument could become a catalyst for the process of enhancing the NPT. We believe that tangible progress in that area is possible if all Member States comply with their obligations regarding nuclear disarmament and horizontal proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Central Asian States continue consultations with the permanent members of the Security Council on the issue of that Treatys entry into force. In our view, the States concerned should strictly comply with their commitment to a moratorium on nuclear test explosions and work to ensure the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. All peaceful nuclear programmes should be carried out in a transparent manner under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency. It is a matter of great concern that the crisis has extended not only to strategic, but also to conventional weapons. Regrettably, Member States have so far failed to devise common approaches to the Programme of Action in that area. We have to step up efforts to tighten national export-control mechanisms. I refer first and to dual-use materials and technologies, as well as to missiles and the means of delivery of weapons of mass destruction, with full and strict compliance with the provisions of the Security Council resolution adopted in 2004. The possibility of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists is a matter of grave concern. To prevent such a scenario, we have to push for the accession of all United Nations Member States to the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. We live in a world where tensions between States and armed conflicts are still very much a part of everyday life. The crisis in Lebanon has highlighted yet again the need to use effectively the United Nations capacity to maintain international peace and security. Since the early days of the conflict, Kazakhstan has called for the strengthening of the Security Councils role in the settlement of that crisis. The deployment of a strengthened contingent of United Nations peacekeepers in the conflict zone was the only viable solution to that large-scale crisis. Regrettably, the lack of an effective mechanism to prevent the break-up and spread of armed conflicts foremost 30 to In our view, the Security Council those Member States the remains a serious problem. establishment of a United Nations preventive diplomacy and conflict prevention centre in Central Asia remains a relevant proposition. That Centre would focus on the provision of advice and expertise to the countries of the region, taking into account their national interests and security considerations. It is vitally important to identify how the belated adoption of resolution on Lebanon is consistent with the process of United Nations reform. The inefficiency of the institutional system of the United Nations and the lack of broad understanding among Member States negatively affect global and regional stability and security. Kazakhstan has decided to run for a seat on the Economic and Social Council. We express our that have appreciation supported our nomination. If elected, we intend actively to participate in the work of that important United Nations organ on all substantive items on its agenda. Speaking from this high rostrum, I feel obliged to the resurgence of express serious concern about international terrorism. Recent explosions in Iraq and Turkey and the aborted London terror plot indicate that this global threat is clearly growing. It is impossible to counter the threat without consolidated efforts on the part of the entire international community to speed up the relevant counter-terrorism conventions and Security Council resolutions. We have to strengthen cooperation between Member States at the United Nations. The early conclusion of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism is very much on our agenda. With illegal routes for the delivery of Afghan drugs from Asia to Europe running through its territory, Kazakhstan makes every effort to address that threat, yet it is clear that no country in the world can address it effectively on its own. The fight will be effective only if we join our efforts and mobilize the resources of the United Nations and its specialized agencies. It is precisely for that reason that Kazakhstan has supported the United Nations initiative to set up in Kazakhstan a Central Asian regional information and coordination centre to fight illegal drug trafficking. the General results of International Assemblys High-level Dialogue on Migration and Development. We believe that those implementation of We welcome the issues illegal migration, labour migration and discussions have helped to lay the groundwork for a regular dialogue on that issue among all parties concerned. As a country of destination, transit and origin for migration, Kazakhstan is willing to take an active part in the search for solutions to the problems of the protection of the rights of migrants. In our view, development issues should remain the focus of attention of the international community. the The timely and effective achievement of Millennium Development Goals will grow in importance as we approach 2015. Kazakhstan supports decisions on development taken at major international conferences and United Nations summits, and calls for their timely and effective implementation. As the largest landlocked country, Kazakhstan urges the international community — above all the developed countries — to make every effort to meet the needs of the least developed and developing landlocked countries. The structural reforms carried out since its independence have totally transformed Kazakhstan. Today, it is one of the most dynamic States of the world and has set ambitious goals to promote further development. The average growth of our gross domestic product over the past five years is 10 per cent. The World Bank has included Kazakhstan in the top 20 most attractive economies for investment. The Government works to ensure that Kazakhstan will join the ranks of the most competitive economies. To reach that target, we have developed an innovative industrial economic development programme and finance relevant projects through a special national fund. All the basic development institutions have been established. Negotiations on Kazakhstans admission to the World Trade Organization are in their final stages. Programmes are being the transport and transit capacity of the country, and large- scale projects are being carried out to integrate the countrys transportation infrastructure into the Eurasian transportation system. the Millennium Development Goals. The United Nations Development Programme report issued on the eve of the 2005 World Summit demonstrates that our country has made great strides in that area. resources, Kazakhstan will continue to pursue its policy to ensure As a major exporter of energy its commitment implemented Kazakhstan to use renews to 31 religious their delivery to world markets through multiple routes. With the growing economy, the Government is consistently increasing social spending, primarily in health care, education, employment and other areas. Our efforts have made it possible for the World Bank to rank Kazakhstan as a successful State with a dynamically growing economy. We pay close attention to the promotion of democracy, the building of civil society and the enhancement of inter-ethnic and inter-faith accord within the country. Our accomplishments are evident. My country, home to more than 100 ethnic groups and practically all religions, is a model of tolerance, accord and stability. It is no accident that Kazakhstan has hosted a forum of leaders of world and traditional religions. The second congress has just completed its deliberations in Astana, at which leaders adopted a declaration calling for an active dialogue among religions. We cannot allow the use of religious differences as an instrument of hatred and strife, and we have to save humanity from a global clash of religions and cultures. The congress has become Kazakhstans contribution to global dialogue among religions. Kazakhstan carries out a balanced foreign policy based on our long-term national interests and aimed at the development of friendly ties with neighbouring countries and all interested countries of the world. As the current Chair of the Commonwealth of Independent States, my country has devised a plan to reform that organization in order to enhance its capacity. Kazakhstan has been working actively in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Eurasian Economic Community and supports the Collective Security Treaty Organization. Ahead of the other post-Soviet countries in many areas, Kazakhstan has always assumed responsibility for the implementation of international initiatives, whether the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground, or to voluntarily renounce nuclear weapons, or its initiatives to convene a regional security forum in Asia, or to hold a congress of leaders of world and traditional religions or to host the transit-transport cooperation or to host a special meeting of the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee. In 2007, Kazakhstan will host the sixty-third session of the first global conference on to shut down the decision it be as an to raise "}}
