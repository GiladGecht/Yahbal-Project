In that regard, we would like to commend the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Emergency Relief Coordinator and his Office for their ongoing efforts, especially as regards the restructuring of the Central Emergency Response Fund. Monaco is a contributor to the Fund and intends to continue its efforts to provide financing for humanitarian assistance during the years to come.
