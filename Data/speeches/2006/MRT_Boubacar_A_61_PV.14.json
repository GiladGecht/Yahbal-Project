We firmly believe that her experience will guarantee an excellent grasp of all the issues and that she will carry out her task with wisdom and skill. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to her predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his admirable and tireless efforts in the reform process of the United Nations and moving it forward. I also thank and congratulate Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, and his team for their untiring contribution to improving the work methods of the Organization in order to achieve its objectives in all areas. I also take the opportunity to welcome the Republic of Montenegro as a new Member of the United Nations. We particularly pay tribute to the important resolutions dealing with the creation of the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. Without a doubt, those two new bodies will contribute to improving the Organizations activities to find 28 to stress and We wish of women, the resolutions and solutions to two of the main concerns of the peoples and Member Governments of the United Nations, namely, conflicts and wars, and the impact that they have on the rights and dignity of individuals and communities. We are all aware of the direct impact of those issues on peace, security, development, justice and democracy throughout the world. the important work of the United Nations between the two sessions, namely conferences and summits dealing with the information society and the HIAIDS pandemic, as well as meetings on development, alleviating poverty, protecting the environment, promoting the advancement dealing with unemployment and the issues of migration. How we meet the need for development, security and peace throughout the world will depend on how we deal with the issues of violence and terrorism. Since the phenomenon of terrorism is universal in nature, the solution to it must also be found through a global vision that is anchored in understanding and dialogue between civilizations and nations, a vision that rejects confrontation and conflict and seeks to overcome poverty, illiteracy and social, scientific and technical underdevelopment. In Mauritania we reject terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We remain faithful to our Islamic values of solidarity, understanding and tolerance, which reject violence and extremism. My country, Mauritania, reiterates its support for peace and for relaunching the negotiation process on all tracks. That is the only way to put an end to the conflict the basis of international resolutions, the Arab Peace Initiative and the Road Map, which will guarantee the Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab in Palestine, Syria and Lebanon and allow the Palestinian people to restore its legitimate rights and establish an independent State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. to Western Sahara, Mauritania supports the measures taken by the United Nations and its Secretary-General to find a lasting solution that guarantees stability in that region and enjoys the support of all stakeholders.

We note with the Middle East, on With regard territories in It of all the stakeholders. rebuilding State the success achieved by in Iraqi satisfaction Government institutions. We reaffirm our support for the unity of Iraq, its territorial integrity and independence and for non-interference in its internal affairs. After the changes of 3 August 2005, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania ushered in a new era in its political history. The new era started with the creation of a pluralist, democratic system based on the guarantee of equality and justice for all. It enshrines the peaceful assumption of authority and transparency in management and administrative reform, while firmly establishing the mechanisms of good governance. These choices have been implemented on the basis of a sound experiment carried out throughout the country using all the active forces of our people, including civil institutions, political parties, trade unions and the transition Government, through a programme of action for justice and democracy that has been implemented with the informed and effective participation includes constitutional reform, reform of the administration of justice, administrative reform to combat corruption, and reform of the electoral system by creating an independent national electoral commission on the basis of transparency and by encouraging the participation of women. In order to ensure total neutrality in the elections, the Military Council for Justice and Democracy has decreed that the President, members of the Military Council, the Prime Minister and members of the civilian transition Government are ineligible to take part in future municipal, legislative and presidential elections. The absence of real democracy, free choice and fair elections led the Military Council for Justice and Democracy to intervene to end the political stalemate that the country was experiencing before 3 August 2005. Here, on behalf of the Mauritanian people, I would like to thank sincerely all fraternal and friendly countries and international organizations and bodies that have supported our reform process and helped and supported us through its various stages. Mauritania is keen to contribute to strengthening the links of fraternity, cooperation and solidarity in its region, in line with the common aspirations of our 29 to strengthening peoples. Within this framework, we affirm our unswerving faith in building an Arab Maghreb as a strategic, non-negotiable choice. We are also profoundly attached to the spirit of fraternity and solidarity on our African continent and to the close relations that link our country to all fraternal African countries. Our country will continue to be faithful the basis for dialogue, exchange and understanding between peoples and civilizations, particularly within the 5+5 forum and the Barcelona Euro-Mediterranean process. The major changes that have taken place on the international scene in recent years require a review and reform of the organs and method of work of the United Nations â€” in particular, by revitalizing the role of the General Assembly and ensuring its resolutions, by reactivating the Economic and Social Council and by making the Security Council more representative. All this should aim to take account not respect for industrialized countries only of important regions in the world, such as Africa and Latin America, or important regional groups, but also of that make major contributions to the United Nations, such as Germany and Japan. We also believe that the Security Council today must improve its methods of work so that it can fulfill its task of maintaining international peace and security. In closing, I would like to express the wish that the work of this session will be crowned with success. "}}
