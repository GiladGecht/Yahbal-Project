{"speech":{"0":" New Zealand remains unwavering in its support for the United Nations. Our commitment has not changed since we helped found the Organization 61 years ago. This years events have only reinforced our belief that the world would be substantially worse off without the United Nations. It would be remiss of me at this time not to pay tribute to Kofi Annan. It is to his vision, determination and courage that we must attribute many of the reforms achieved thus far. Five years ago, when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the Nobel Committee paid tribute to his efforts on reform. Since then he has continued to work tirelessly for a United Nations that can live up to the hopes that “we the peoples” have invested in it. This is all the more remarkable given that, for much of his stewardship, the United Nations has been confronted with some of the most difficult international crises of its existence. New Zealand is committed to multilateralism. This is not some act of faith, but a commitment to a multilateralism that really delivers. We need to be prepared to work diligently for the good of the global community. The United Nations is passing through a period of challenge to its relevance and effectiveness. It has 18 the key threats confronted serious political and security shocks — fresh hostilities in the Middle East, the tragic and worsening situation in Darfur, and, in our own region, instability in Timor-Leste. Last year, world leaders agreed to an ambitious reform agenda based on the three pillars of peace and security, development and human rights. Progress has been made, but this is no time to rest. We must press on, for much remains to be done. The challenge of development has never been higher on the international agenda. Never before has the commitment to eradicating poverty been so critical. But increasing aid levels will not be enough; we must become more effective. We need to make sure that every dollar we spend makes a positive difference. That means addressing to our success — poor governance, corruption and gender inequality. We need to secure fairer international trading relationships, and we must work on all of those together. The theme of this years general debate is the implementation for development. For New Zealand, collective action is imperative. We need participation, ownership and responsibility recipient countries. We seek harmonization with larger contributors to align and combine our contributions. We seek partnership with multilateral development agencies in our campaign to eradicate poverty, and we endorse the efforts of the United Nations and those agencies to coordinate better, country by country. New Zealand, as members are aware, has a relationship with the Pacific that is based on history, culture and economic and social linkages. Our bonds with Pacific States are an important dimension of our other than educated, economically prosperous and safe communities. In the Auckland Declaration of 2004, Pacific leaders committed themselves to a “region that is respected for the sustainable management of its resources, the full observance of democratic values and for its defence and promotion of human rights”. These are ambitious goals, and translating them into reality means hard work by all Pacific countries. That is a challenge that New Zealand accepts. relationships. We want nothing healthy, well-governed, the quality of its governance, from less of a global partnership In facing that challenge, we confront economic, environmental, governance, development and security issues. Markets are distant. Climate change is a reality. Political instability does not help. Threats from communicable diseases such as HIAIDS and pandemic influenza must be managed. The Pacific accounts for almost one quarter of the surface of the world — an area bigger than Europe and the Middle East combined. Its strategic significance presents opportunity and challenge. New Zealand is determined to seek out the benefits of that significance and guard against the threats, among which I include, sadly, cheque-book diplomacy. Across the Pacific, we have learned that regional problems require regional solutions. Last year, Pacific Island Forum leaders adopted the Pacific Plan for regional cooperation. Through that plan we will strengthen regional cooperation where it can most make a difference, and we will use it to promote the four goals of the Pacific Islands Forum: sustainable development, economic growth, security and good governance. At the same time, we do not forget that our regional endeavours depend on strong international frameworks. The Framework Convention on Climate Change is an essential example. Another example is the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement on the conservation and management of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks. We are proud of our achievements in regional fisheries management. The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, with in Pohnpei, manages the regions migratory fish species. We are in the midst of developing new regional arrangements for non-migratory fish stocks. These mechanisms are central to the regions ability to ensure the sustainable management of its most important natural resources. They are at the leading edge in establishing best-practice management norms. There have been profound political and security shocks over the past year — in the Middle East and in Darfur, as well as instability in Timor-Leste — those and more are testing the United Nations system. It is a sad reality that the situation in the Middle East has been on the agenda of the United Nations for 60 years, ever since its inception. The lack of sustained its headquarters 19 It has contributed political will to see through more than a handful of the Middle East has undermined decisions on confidence. to an unstable environment where extremism, injustice and despair flourish. These issues must be tackled with a new resolve, using the international multilateral system as a tool for peace and progress. The international response to the Security Councils call for an expanded United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) shows that the international community can react to conflict and provide basic stabilization. But such responses are doomed to failure unless the underlying political and security issues are addressed. It is therefore imperative to relaunch the Middle East peace process covering all issues, on the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions. The Organizations efforts to introduce a United Nations force into Darfur is being cynically thwarted by the Government of the Sudan. That is simply unconscionable. The Government of the Sudan must, in the name of basic humanity, accept the need for a United Nations force as the best chance for the security of the people of Darfur. New and fragile States face enormous challenges. Recent unrest in Timor-Leste demonstrates that fact. New Zealand responded quickly to Timor-Lestes needs with a military and police contribution to help restore stability. The regional response has been swift and robust. The United Nations played an important role in facilitating Timor-Lestes independence, and it is clear the United Nations will continue to be involved in Timor-Leste to come. The deployment of a substantial United Nations police force is vital if peace and stability is to be maintained even in the medium term. The nature of the expanded United Nations mission in Timor-Leste reflects the deep and broad engagement required to build a lasting peace. Timor-Leste encapsulates the principle that peace and security cannot be separated from economic development, social reconciliation and the protection of basic human rights. The Security Councils mandate for Timor-Leste endorses that truth. New Zealand fully supported the renewed focus on human rights at last years World Summit. We strongly campaigned for the new Human Rights Council, and we worked hard to bring it into being. We have high ambitions for it and will follow its activities for many years is also that conscious of New Zealand indigenous peoples. We had hoped closely. It must remain strong, focused and effective. It must be able to deal swiftly with emerging situations of human rights concern, in a balanced way, with scrupulous attention to verifiable facts. It must be aspirational, inspirational and practical. Its working methods must be transparent and inclusive. Above all, there must be genuine political will to make it work. A few weeks ago, encouraged all the way by energetic non-governmental organizations, Member States agreed on the first new comprehensive human rights instrument of the twenty-first century: a draft convention relating to persons with disabilities. We are proud in New Zealand of the role we played in those negotiations on the text. The draft convention stands to make a real difference to the lives of approximately 650 million of the worlds most disadvantaged citizens. the disadvantages faced by indigenous peoples in many parts of the world. We were closely engaged in the lengthy negotiations towards a declaration on the rights of the declaration would be a new standard of achievement for Governments that could be implemented to really improve the lives of indigenous peoples. Therefore, we are disappointed that that was not to be so. The draft declaration that emerged with less than conclusive support from the Human Rights Council is deeply flawed and represents a lost opportunity for the worlds indigenous peoples. At the beginning of his term, the Secretary- General set an important goal for the United Nations: to perfect “the triangle of development, freedom and peace” (, p. 13). The Secretary-Generals words still ring true today. We have travelled only part of the journey towards that goal. Considering our achievements over the past year, we can be satisfied with progress made in setting up the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. The challenge now is to make those two new bodies truly effective. The welcome adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution ) reminds us of the efforts we must continue to make at regional and national levels. New Zealand wants to see continuing reform high on the list of priorities for the sixty-first session in order to ensure that the United Nations can be as responsive as possible to the needs of Member States, 20 and efficient in getting the best from the resources available to it. Sixty years ago, New Zealand had high hopes for the United Nations. In 2006, we still do. New Zealand is a country that engages with the United Nations with no hidden agenda. What we say is what we mean. We engage with no other or hidden agenda. But those that do so pervert and weaken this Organization. In 2006, at this meeting, New Zealand declares that we will continue to put our efforts behind the principles and policies that will make the United Nations strong. "}}
