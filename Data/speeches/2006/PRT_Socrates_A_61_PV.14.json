{"speech":{"0":" I would like to begin, like previous speakers, by extending my warmest congratulations to Ms. Haya Rasheed Al- Khalifa, the first woman in nearly 40 years to take up the position of President of the General Assembly. This is good news for international politics. I wish her every success in discharging the mandate on which she is now beginning, in which she can be assured of Portugals firm support. We are confident that she will continue the excellent work carried out by her predecessor, Minister Jan Eliasson, whom I am very happy to remember here. This session of the Assembly is also notable for being the last during which Secretary-General Kofi Annan will be in office. I therefore solemnly express on behalf of the Portuguese people our heartfelt, deep appreciation for the way in which he has carried out his duties over the last 10 years, contributing concretely and decisively to international peace and stability in a world that we all wish were more just. It was on his watch — and with his indispensable personal help — that we saw the birth of the new State of Timor-Leste. Portugal will not forget that this was one of the great recent victories of the United Nations, in peoples fight for self-determination, and in defence of the values in the Charter. This Organization has carried out a crucial task in Timor-Leste, in maintaining peace, consolidating the rule of law and, together with donor countries, creating the foundations for a more prosperous economic and social future for the Timorese people. There is still a long way to go, it is true. But it is important that the Timorese people be aware that they can count on the United Nations. Unfortunately, the 23 the that the values investment made by recent internal crisis raised a serious question about security, and it is vital that this be resolved if the country is to find stability. We therefore applaud the new United Nations peace mission, the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste, which represents a continuity of the significant international community, to which Portugal belongs. We participate actively in this Mission, consistent with our ongoing commitment, going back over three decades, to the political process of the new State of Timor-Leste. In this regard, I would also like to pay due tribute to the memory of Sergio Vieira de Mello, brutally murdered three years ago in Baghdad in the service of the United Nations. We will not forget all that he did for the just cause of the Timorese people, and in defence of the United Nations embodies. This last decade has been one of great changes. The United Nations has had undoubted successes, but there have also been missed opportunities. Many accuse the Organization of undue complexity, slowness in excessive bureaucracy. It is true that diplomacy requires time, but it does produce results. If there is something that we have learned over these last years, it is that there is no alternative to multilateralism; multilateralism is where the United Nations plays a determinant role. The United Nations is today one of the greatest guarantors of our collective security. It is our duty to preserve and strengthen it. It is an investment from which we all stand to benefit. Each one of us is a Member of this Organization not only to serve and promote our own national interests, but also — and I would go so far as to say above all — to fulfil the hopes and dreams of the people of the whole world. The world today, as we know, is full of risks and threats that no country can face alone. If we do not unite in our efforts, we are halfway down the road to failure. Reality, particularly in recent years, has proved this to us quite clearly. I would therefore like to underline Portugals commitment to multilateralism, because we firmly believe that this is the path where one can best uphold the essential values of peace and development. A big part of this multilateral action rests on a dialogue between cultures and civilizations. It is its decision-making process and the huge Despite uncertainties irrespective of the other hand, imposes steps forward on through this dialogue that we assume a collective responsibility to overcome obstacles, prejudices, preconceived ideas and, principally, ignorance. Our challenge here in this dialogue is not to limit ourselves to mere declarations, but to take firm and concrete steps towards greater interaction between peoples and cultures. and misunderstandings in the world today, we have a set of principles — contained in our Charter — that can inspire us and guide us. They are our best help. The dialogue between cultures and civilizations also imposes demanding domestic political agendas, in the respect for differences and the inclusion of all citizens in society — the inclusion of immigrants; the inclusion of all, their beliefs or religions. the dialogue between On the civilizations also international scene, the strengthening of economic bonds between North and South. The strengthening of world trade mechanisms constitutes an investment in our own security, and is an essential part of that dialogue; hence the importance of overcoming the obstacles of the Doha Round in the context of the current negotiations in the World Trade Organization. We all have to be prepared to give up something so that at the end of the day everyone can win. One of the biggest political challenges that we face in this dialogue of cultures and civilizations is undoubtedly the Middle East. The region remains one of the main focal points of instability in the world. We all have in our minds the painful images of the most recent crisis in Lebanon, where we witnessed the suffering of civilians on both sides of the conflict. This reinforces all the more the need to actively pursue a permanent and balanced solution, which may bring about a dynamic of hope and peace in the region. The Middle East is not a military issue. The Middle East is, above all, one of the greatest political and diplomatic challenges that todays world faces. We should not, therefore, miss the window of opportunity offered to us by Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). It is a challenge where the United Nations and the European Union assume shared responsibilities in promoting peace and stability, through an effective multilateral dialogue. 24 to today stress here I am pleased Portugal fulfils its duty and supports the urgent implementation of this resolution, and we are present in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon to help implement it. I would like to draw attention, once more, to Africa. Portugal has given it great attention, and invested great efforts there, and it is our duty to ensure that the continent is not forgotten. There is progress in Africa that we should encourage, and we also have a historical responsibility on which the developed world should not and cannot turn its back. the determination with which the European Union has been reinforcing its partnership and its strategy with the African continent. The current drafting of a Euro- African joint strategy will lead to a script for our relations with Africa in the fundamental areas of peace and security, good governance and human rights, regional trade and integration, and also aspects relating to human development. I stress the word “joint”. All of us share the responsibility — Africans and Europeans alike. I trust that the conditions will soon be right for this strategy to be adopted. And I hope that it will be at the highest level, when we hold in Lisbon the second European Union-Africa summit. In recent years, with the consolidation of the African Union and various regional organizations and initiatives, very significant progress has been made in many fields on the African continent, and this has been driven by the continent itself and its own institutions. It is our duty to recognize these developments, support them with renewed support and vigour, and develop them further. I would also like to recall that last July, in Bissau, the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries celebrated its tenth anniversary. This organization has been consolidating its involvement within the United Nations system, where it currently holds observer status, presenting itself as a credible organization in the fostering of international partnerships. In Bissau, on the tenth anniversary, we pledged our the Millennium commitment Development Goals, by defining and implementing a general cooperation strategy where the highest priority is given to achieving these Goals. This is our priority strengthening itself and achieve to in our domestic policy in Portugal; at the top of our priorities are the Millennium Development Goals. We shall implement them with a bilateral and multilateral cooperation strategy that will help to fight poverty, alleviate the pressure on migratory flows and promote sustainable development. September in New York, above all else, should not be some sort of annual pilgrimage to rediscover this Organization. At the end of the day, the credibility of the United Nations is in our hands. We all face the same challenges. But, at the same time, they give us the opportunity to live in accordance with our ideals and put into practice the principles that have guided us for more than six decades. The only way out is for us to look for answers together. That is why we need a stronger and more cohesive United Nations. We owe this to ourselves. We owe it to our children. But, above all, we owe to future generations. "}}
