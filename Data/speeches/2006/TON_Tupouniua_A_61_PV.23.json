Let us reassure you of Tongas full support and its confidence that the sixty-first session of the General Assembly will be productive and successful under your very able leadership. Full recognition is also in order for the excellent work of your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson, during the sixtieth session of the General Assembly. In the same vein, the Tongan delegation takes this opportunity to commend and extend its gratitude to the outgoing Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless service over the past 10 years in the stewardship of the Organization. It has been a year since our leaders met at the historic World Summit in an effort to embrace the realities of the world we live in and to duly reflect those challenges in the work of the Organization. We are pleased that there are specific landmarks that attest to the fact that some progress has been made in the implementation of the 2005 Outcome Document (resolution ).

Tonga also welcomes the adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution ), which forms a basis upon which we can build our consistent and unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations — committed by whomever, whenever and for whatever purpose — for terrorism constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. We look forward to the effective implementation of the Strategy, as well as the conclusion of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism during the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. Tonga also remains committed to supporting the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. We duly recognize the efforts undertaken to consolidate States reporting requirements. We also wish to acknowledge the cooperation provided by bilateral, regional and multilateral agencies in helping to fulfil international and regional commitments to combat transnational organized crime and to fight terrorism. Tonga shares the call for the full restoration of the role of the General Assembly as the main decision- making, representative and policy-making body of the United Nations, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter. That would further enhance the credibility of multilateralism and the important need to address the multifaceted and interconnected challenges and threats confronting the world. remainder of the the reform mandates, especially as the work pertaining Tonga supports to to 3 to meet todays and in helping parties regards Secretariat and management reforms, the strengthening of the Economic and Social Council and the strengthening and streamlining of management in the Organization. The important issue of the reform of the Security Council still remains unresolved, although world leaders acknowledged that it was an essential element of our overall effort. Tonga supports the call by the Secretary-General in his annual report () to find common ground for action on this fundamental piece of overall United Nations reform, as well as his urging that a decision on Council reform be taken sooner rather than later in order to ensure that the United Nations machinery to promote the establishment and maintenance of peace and security will remain relevant and credible tomorrows challenges. Tonga continues to support Japans assumption of its proper and permanent place in any enhanced Council. Tonga commends the contributions of United Nations peacekeepers in fulfilling the Organizatios vital role to end hostilities. To the degree that it is able, Tonga is committed international and regional peacekeeping efforts, including the current Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. For many island developing countries, including my own, the development agenda remains a top priority. In that regard, the theme of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly, “Implementing a global partnership for development”, is not only very pertinent but also very timely. While we reiterate that we for our own development, we continue to welcome as a necessary step the maintenance and enhancement of support at the regional and international levels to complement our national efforts. That includes the support provided under regional cooperation and integration, which was endorsed by Pacific leaders in 2005, as well as the implementation of the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. Tonga looks forward to progress in the work to enhance mechanisms to promote coherent United Nations support to small island developing States through a strengthened inter-agency consultative the Mauritius Strategy to supporting both the Pacific Plan take primary responsibility in conflict strengthen for to the to that relevant the fact stakeholders. the potential the success of and opportunities process, the finalization of a strategy for resource mobilization and the promotion of partnership initiatives. In May of this year, His Majestys Government ratified its Strategic Development Plan 8, entitled “Looking to the future, building on the past”, which sets out the Governments road map for the Kingdoms future development path for the period 2006-2007 to 2008-2009. The document was formulated following a lengthy and extensive process of consultation with all of It provides due recognition the implementation of the Development Plan will require the efforts of both State and non-State actors. The President of the General Assembly has rightly observed that the recent historic High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development revealed that globalization presents as a force for improving the lives of millions of people. The meeting provided Tonga, a mature migration-remittance economy, with the opportunity to showcase the important nexus between migration and development. A study recently produced by the World Bank concluded recipient household migration and remittances have positive impacts on migrant-sending countries through improved income distribution and poverty alleviation, induced higher savings and stimulated business activities, resulting in in education. The study also larger highlighted improved restricted, but organized, labour mobility can significantly contribute to a countrys gross domestic product and to overall global income. Labour mobility is therefore a potential vehicle for achieving our commitment to pro-poor strategies such as the Millennium Development Goals and other commitments, and also for achieving national sustainable development strategies. The suspension of the Doha round of trade talks was disappointing. The failure to conclude the talks will negatively affect global economic prospects and the growth of low-income countries, including Tonga. We join others in urging World Trade Organization member countries to maintain their commitment to the rules-based multilateral trading system, preserve progress that has been achieved and to continue with the negotiations. We also continue to urge the donor community to move forward with the delivery of aid for Tonga, investments that, that and 4 the competitiveness of for trade, independent of the Doha round. Regional cooperation on trade-related projects has the potential to promote low-income countries, such as the island economies of the Pacific. In October 2005, Tongas Legislative Assembly passed a motion to establish a National Committee of the Kingdom of Tonga on Political Reform. With the support of His Majestys Government, the Committee chaired by His Late Royal Highness Prince Tuipelehake has completed public meetings and consultations throughout Tonga as well as in the countries where the majority of Tongans reside, namely, New Zealand, Australia and the United States of America. It is anticipated that the report will be deliberated upon by the Legislative Assembly during its 2006 session and by His Majestys Government with a view to attaining an appropriate political reform agenda that is not only responsive but also responsible for fulfilling the objectives of building national unity and promoting the social and economic advancement of the people of Tonga.
