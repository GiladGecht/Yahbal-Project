{"speech":{"0":" Let me first of all congratulate Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I am confident that, with her wealth of experience, she will guide our deliberations effectively. I wish also to thank her predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden, for the manner in which he presided over the high-level segment of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session. Let me also pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his leadership of our Organization. His 10- year tenure has been marked by fundamental changes. The United Nations has witnessed major reforms geared at creating a more efficient and effective institution. We are confident that he will leave behind a more vibrant Organization capable of meeting the challenges of our time. As a firm supporter of multilateralism, Uganda believes that the Assembly is the most appropriate forum for addressing issues of global concern. A great number of important decisions have been taken by the Assembly. Landmark agreements have been reached and important commitments undertaken by members of the Assembly. In spite of all these efforts, threats to global peace and security and to human dignity are more serious 48 than ever before. This situation obtains today because we have yet to start addressing the real root causes of the problems facing us. My delegation believes that ensuring global peace will continue to be an uphill task for us as long as the majority in developing countries and elsewhere in the world continue to suffer the indignity of poverty and deprivation while we continue to think that it is business as usual. We must ask ourselves why a large number of international problems that are high on the agenda of the United Nations are occurring in the developing part of the world. These are real issues that affect the daily lives of peoples, and they require urgent solutions which have been to date been far too slow in coming. The onus is on the Assembly to ensure that what we agree upon or commit ourselves to doing is done in a timely manner. The Millennium Declaration that we adopted here 6 years ago (resolution ) remains an important milestone because it introduced a new paradigm shift from emphasis on statement of commitments to action. However, there have been some obstacles to the achievement of the goals we set for ourselves. In areas where progress has been made, due credit must be given. In that regard, Uganda welcomes the establishment of the Human Rights Council to work alongside the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council. We are also pleased that action was the Peacebuilding promptly to Commission as an intergovernmental mechanism to assist countries in transition from war to durable peace. We welcome important contributions to the reform agenda of the United Nations. While commendable progress has been achieved in other areas of reform, great frustration remains over the reform and expansion of the Security Council. In my delegations view, the expansion of the Security Council is the most important facet of United Nations reform with regard to the maintenance of global peace and security. It is now a truism that the Security Council does not reflect todays geopolitical realities, but only the balance of power that prevailed in the 1940s. Africa is the only continent with no permanent member on the Security Council, despite its size and population. That is why Africa is demanding at least two permanent the seats on the Council. We acknowledge create important those as taken that to move Lack of agreement on how existence of the veto is an anachronism, but as long as it exists we should demand it, because do not want to join as second-class members, with no veto. the development agenda forward is one of our major concerns. It is unacceptable for big sections of the global community to continue living on less than one dollar per day while we have the capacity and the means to pull them out of that abject poverty. We must address that problem as a matter of urgency. One way of doing so is to live by our own commitments, as reflected, for example, in the Monterrey Consensus, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the Brussels Plan of Action, et cetera, et cetera. We must put in place measurable benchmarks to realize those goals. It is disappointing to see that very little progress has been made to date on official development assistance, on foreign direct investments, on debts, or even on market access. The stalled conclusion of the World Trade Organization development agenda is a case in point. The Doha Development Round was launched as a process that would eventually give developing countries a fair chance to compete in the world marketplace. It was expected to restore the momentum of the open market while giving genuine priority to the concerns and interests of developing countries. Five years down the road, we have not agreed on opening up markets or eliminating discriminative subsidies. My delegation strongly feels that part of that failure is attributable to the multilateral systems lack of good global governance, poor coordination and lack of coherence. As the United Nations has a responsibility to identify the causes hindering the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the Organization is the right body to track implementation of commitments undertaken by development partners. An effective mechanism should be devised for doing that. Uganda calls on the international community, and the United Nations in particular, to explore new and more effective ways of promoting consensus on issues of vital the peace, security and prosperity of our global community. In that regard, we would like to welcome and encourage the holding of importance to 49 to and systems should effectively that have been organized The High-level Dialogue on the high-level events alongside this session. International Migration and Development held last week has produced important outcomes that are going to be valuable in the formulation of policies on international migration and development. In the same light, the convening of the High-level Meeting on the midterm comprehensive global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries is a welcome decision as it will feed into the midterm review. With regard to Africas development, the New Partnership for Africas Development — NEPAD — is the key framework for action. We continue to urge development partners to support Africas efforts by contributing positively the implementation of that regional development strategy. Of the United Nations system in particular we request that the funding that comes from United Nations development focus on Africas priorities as determined by the partner States, while care should be taken to avoid diversion of development resources to other donor-driven activities. I would like now to briefly turn my attention to the situation in our region. Ugandas security and development is directly interlinked with developments in the Great Lakes region. We are therefore fully committed to the realization of peace and security, and have continued to play a key role in the search for durable peace and security in our region. We welcome the positive developments in the southern Sudan the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. We fully support the democratic process being pursued in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We call upon all parties involved to have full confidence in the process so that it can be successfully completed. The regional initiative on Burundi under Ugandas chairmanship has made steady progress, and we have full confidence in its success. Uganda also wishes to appeal to the international community, especially our development partners, to region by support contributing generously the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, initiated by the United Nations in collaboration with the African Union. the success of signing of the peace following the initiatives in the to to support terror on the Security Council With regard to Somalia, we call for international support for the Transitional Federal Government. We call on the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) peace process and the partial lifting of the arms embargo to enable deployment of the IGAD Peace Support Mission to Somalia and the African Union forces. At the national level, in Uganda there is an organization called the Lords Resistance Army (LRA), a terrorist group with no political agenda, which has for a number of years unleashed the population of northern Uganda, killing and maiming people and abducting children for training as killers and use as sex slaves. The LRA has now been defeated and its remnants have fled to Garamba Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Government of Uganda has now entered into peace talks with the LRA under the mediation of the Government of southern Sudan with a view to restoring peace and stability. After a careful analysis of the situation, the Government of Uganda decided to take the painful decision to offer amnesty to the LRA top leadership, in order to facilitate the peace talks. That decision was painful in the sense that we do not condone or tolerate impunity whatsoever. However, we are convinced that the alternative traditional justice system that we intend to apply is an equitable solution and should be given a chance. We call on the international community to support the process that we have embarked on. We are determined to resolve the conflict peacefully. Peace is what our people want, and it is peace that we are determined to give them. "}}
