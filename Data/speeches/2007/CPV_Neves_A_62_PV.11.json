{"speech":{"0":" While we commend the United Nations for having chosen climate change as the theme for this sixty-second session of the General Assembly, at the same time we recall that many countries in the South have, in recent decades, warned the international community about this phenomenon, which is being experienced here and there and desertification. Climate change has multiple causes, some natural and others generated by human action. Therefore, the responsibilities of States and societies with respect to these changes are not equal. Nor are the impacts they have on the lives of the common citizen. droughts through drama the of This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of speeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only.

Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum. (E) *0752121* the the and and insular small island State and has experienced drought and desertification and suffered from almost uninterrupted water shortages for more than three decades. Indeed, Cape Verde, given its location, size, landscape archipelagic characteristics of its territory, is a prime example of the convergence and concentration of the negative effects of climate change. Drought and desertification have an unquestionable impact on family income and the poverty rate. They also undermine Government efforts and strongly condition the mobilization and allocation of resources for development financing. In the light of the challenges of climate change, one should recall the leading role that the United Nations has had and continues to have in mustering efforts to raise awareness about this critical problem for the future of mankind. We are convinced that the Bali conference will set new parameters based on the principle of equity, legitimate aspirations of populations to development and the differentiated responsibilities of each and everyone. We therefore call on the United Nations to pursue its efforts in this area and give very special attention to small island States, which have to contend with multiple fragilities and vulnerabilities. It is imperative to resume and implement the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. The community of nations cannot but acknowledge that, given their origins and their role throughout history, small island States are a “heritage of mankind”. In spite of its structural vulnerabilities and its undeniable lack of natural resources, Cape Verde has, since independence in 1975, followed a positive and consistent development path. It is in this context that we should consider Cape Verdes graduation or, in other words, its withdrawal from the group of least developed countries as of 2008. We are resolved to rise to the challenge of this new development stage and through audacious strategies and decisions to transform the country. We are quite aware the main responsibility for Cape Verdes development rests in the hands of the Cape Verdean Government and citizens. This is the spirit that has guided us in the past, and it is the spirit that will allow us to face the challenge of graduation. Nevertheless, during the transition period we hope to be able to count on strong that to the international community to pay special attention partnership from in dealing with Cape Verdes structural fragility and any new vulnerabilities. In this regard, I call on the United Nations and Member States the declaration of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group and to the report that the Government will soon deliver to the Secretary-General in accordance with the resolution on graduation which the General Assembly adopted in December 2004. While it is true that our development strategy is open, daring and driven by the desire to create opportunities for foreign direct investment, it is no less true that today, more than ever, we need innovative aid and financing modalities that are better adjusted to the pace we want to set for Cape Verdes development and to the imperatives of the transition. It is high time that we move from discourse to action with respect to ownership, in accordance with the spirit of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Allow me also briefly to recall the transborder and global nature of many modern day phenomena. I refer to climate change and, of course, to terrorism, organized crime and trafficking of all kinds. These represent a threat to human security and to the they corrupt values, democratic rule of compromise development and the most legitimate expectations of peoples. We are living at a time when problems and threats are of concern to all. They are not confined to a single State or region. Nor can there be local solutions to the global threats of our era. Responses to these issues will be ineffective unless they are undertaken within a robust, balanced and fair multilateral perspective. The United Nations is, and should continue to be, the foundation, the forum of multilateralism. We are strongly convinced that the United Nations must be strengthened for the sake of the future of the world and of the ideals of peace, security and development. And we are all faced with the challenge of translating the reiterated statements of the into coherent and consistent action. It is a question of credibility in the eyes of the world, which is watching us. I cannot conclude without extending my greetings, congratulations and encouragement to the Secretary-General and wishing him success in guiding international community the guarantor and law, as thwart 2 efficiency, modernization the our common Organization towards fully attaining its imperatives of founding goals and meeting increased and democratization in its work. Likewise, I would like to extend warm greetings to you, Mr. President, and to assure you of our confidence that you will face the important challenges confronting the Assembly with serenity and a sense of duty.
