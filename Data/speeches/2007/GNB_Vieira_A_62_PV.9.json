Its eradication will only be possible through international cooperation. The emergency plan trafficking developed by my Government illustrates my countrys determination to make the fight against the trafficking of drugs and organized crime a national objective. Unfortunately, however, we do not have the trained human resources or the material and financial means needed to carry it out. I am pleased that an international conference on drug trafficking in West Africa will take place soon. We would like to thank the Portuguese Government for its willingness to host it in Lisbon. Likewise, a regional conference to be held in Dakar will seek to promote better coordination between the subregion. I would like to launch an appeal to all countries able to share their experience and technology relating to drug trafficking and organized crime to assist us in the fight against those criminal activities, which jeopardize the internal security and stability of our countries and pose a great danger to our young people. In that regard, I welcome the efforts of the United Nations system to establish a genuine international network to eradicate this scourge. The Government of Guinea-Bissau has decided to launch programme to address problems in the financial sector that will serve as an adjustment instrument vis-a-vis international financial institutions. That step will certainly allow us to re-establish and strengthen the framework for interaction and external partnerships of cooperation for development. The approval of a post-conflict programme by the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund will be an important step towards achieving the countrys economic recovery and stabilization. We are aware of our responsibilities to manage transparently the meagre resources at our disposal and to combat corruption through good governance based on true democracy. The disbursement of pledges made during the donors conference for Guinea-Bissau in Geneva last November the political and institutional stabilization of our country. It goes without saying that without the firm support of the international community, it will be difficult for us to put the consolidation of stability and for the promotion of true the conditions necessary is much-needed in place for in to tribute to pay Allow me (UNOGBIS) national political reconciliation, which is essential if we are to preserve peace and achieve sustainable development in Guinea-Bissau. subregional organizations such as the Economic Community of West African States and the West African Economic and Monetary Union for their constant support and solidarity, from which we have benefited in our efforts to confront the enormous political, economic and financial difficulties we face. I would also like to welcome the important contribution made by the International Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau to improve dialogue between international development partners and to mobilize external assistance for my country at a particularly difficult moment in our recent history. It is also important to emphasize the role played by the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Guinea-Bissau of the Economic and Social Council. I wish to express our thanks for the contribution of the United Nations system in general, as well as that of the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in Guinea-Bissau the process of establishing peace and political stability in our country. The relationship between the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries and the United Nations has been developing in a steady and satisfactory manner. We draw attention to the progress already made in consolidating democracy and the rule of law as well as in promoting respect for human rights in the Community. This constitutes a marked change in the life of the peoples of its member States. Indeed, our eight countries — Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea- Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, Sao Tome and Principe and Timor-Leste — are committed to pooling together their affinities and their cultural identities in order to establish a forum for exchange, in a spirit of constant and active solidarity. My country, Guinea-Bissau, has benefited from the support of these sister countries in tackling the many difficulties I have outlined. On behalf of the people of Guinea-Bissau, I warmly commend the leaders present here, and thank them, reiterating our determination the historical ties of friendship and cooperation among our peoples.

China is one nation, one people. The Peoples Republic of Chinas contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security and its partnership, especially with regard to cooperation for development, are exemplary. The Peoples Republic of China is the sole, legitimate and true representative of the Chinese people. We are aware of the problems and the difficulties which we confront in the world in general, and in Africa in particular, where conflict situations and humanitarian crises persist, as in Darfur and in Somalia. We hope that a new spirit of cooperation will prevail within the international community so that a lasting solution and peace can be found in the Middle East. We therefore need an effective Organization that represents the geographical, cultural and religious diversity of the world, an Organization that takes into consideration and defends with equal commitment and determination the legitimate aspirations of a large number of countries for just representation and participation in the deliberations and decision-making of the Security Council.
