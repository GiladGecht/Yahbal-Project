{"speech":{"0":" With regard to your reference to the country of origin of the next speaker, I would like to point out the following. I first give the floor to the representative of the Security Council, by The Security Council, by its resolution 817 (1993), has recommended, and the General Assembly, by its resolution of 8 April 1993, has decided that that country will be provisionally referred to, for all purposes within the United Nations, as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, pending settlement of the difference that has arisen over the name of this State. Furthermore, its resolution 845 (1993) urged “the parties to continue their efforts under the auspices of the Secretary- General to arrive at a speedy settlement of the remaining issues” (para. 2). I would therefore request that the proper name, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, be used for all purposes within the United Nations, pursuant to the aforementioned resolutions and in view of the fact that there are ongoing negotiations between the two countries.
