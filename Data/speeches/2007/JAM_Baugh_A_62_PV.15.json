{"speech":{"0":" It is my great pleasure, Sir, sincere to extend congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly. The Jamaican delegation is confident that much will be accomplished during the sixty-second session under your able leadership. You can be assured of the Jamaican delegation in that endeavour. To your predecessor, Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, the Jamaican delegation extends its appreciation for her unstinting efforts in advancing the work of the General Assembly during its sixty-first session. Jamaica also wishes to pay tribute to the laudable efforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon who, since his assumption of office in January of this year, has moved forward in earnest to enhance the process of reform of the United Nations. I am deeply honoured to be addressing the General Assembly at its sixty-second session on behalf of my country, Jamaica. The time has come to reassess our collective response to these issues and to renew our efforts in support of sustainable development. Adequate financial resources are essential in the implementation of the wider internationally agreed development issues of International surrounding follow-up Conference on Financing is particularly significant this year, as we prepare for the Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus, to be held in Doha next year. The Bahamas would wish for the deliberations of the upcoming High-level Dialogue, as well as the 2008 meeting of the Economic and Social Council with the the World Trade Bretton Woods Organization the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), to provide practical input into, and contribute to the success of that most important review conference. the voice and participation of developing nations in international goals. Consideration the to for Development issue of strengthening institutions, (WTO) The and the 4 and norm-setting economic decision-making is especially important to the Bahamas. There is a definite need for concrete, realistic proposals to ensure the effective, permanent representation of developing countries, particularly small developing countries, not only in the Bretton Woods institutions and the WTO but also in the other international economic and financial institutions, such as the Financial Stability Forum, the Financial Action Task Force and the Basel Committee. The Bahamas welcomes the positive development in the area of international cooperation in tax matters, namely, the establishment of the Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters within the Economic and Social Council. The establishment of that Committee ensures that the interests of small developing States Members of the United Nations with different tax regimes will be factored into discussions and recommendations aimed at adopting mutually agreed standards that do not unduly favour the wealthy nations at the expense of meaningful development in the States and Organization and Development. We have reached the halfway mark in the time frame we set ourselves in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to undertake concrete steps by the year 2015 the economic and environmental challenges plaguing the international community and the Organization, but various social ills as well. In so doing, we gave those who are less fortunate hope for a better and more equitable world. that progress has been achieved in the reduction of the proportion of people living in poverty, the reduction of child and maternal mortality rates and the increase of primary school enrolment levels. However, nearly 20 million children worldwide continue to be severely malnourished and suffer from various preventable diseases that will undoubtedly affect their survival and rob them of their full potential. Overall progress in achieving equal rights and the empowerment of women is also too slow. My Government regards effective and practical measures the enhancement of educational partnerships to facilitate the development of our human resources to impact accelerated change as critical issues. jurisdictions not members of for Economic Cooperation The MDG Report 2007 demonstrates to address poverty and to address not only are to threat to HIAIDS attributable remains a global the development, progress and stability of our societies. If the goal of universal access to comprehensive prevention, treatment, care and support by 2010 is to be achieved, commitments entered into in the 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIAIDS and the 2006 Political Declaration on HIAIDS must be implemented. The necessary financial and technical support to developing countries must be provided to help bridge the gap and foster a more comprehensive and sustainable global response to this pandemic. Equally important is the fact that 63 per cent of deaths worldwide non- communicable diseases resulting from factors such as obesity, high cholesterol, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, tobacco use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet and alcohol abuse. At a recent summit of CARICOM heads of Government, a number of action steps were identified. The Governments have agreed to establish, by mid-2008, comprehensive plans for the screening and management of chronic diseases and risk factors, so that, by 2012, 80 per cent of people in the Caribbean region with non-communicable diseases would receive quality care and have access to preventive education based on regional guidelines. In spite of the efforts of various entities and the existence of United Nations conventions to protect the rights of women and children, discrimination and violence children persist throughout the world. In an effort to better address this problem, the Bahamas has drafted a new Child Protective Act and a Domestic Violence Protection Order to enhance and provide greater protection to these vulnerable groups. Last year the United Nations Global Counter- Terrorism Strategy (resolution ) was adopted, marking an important step towards the elaboration of a counter-terrorism convention. The Bahamas continues to condemn terrorism and recognizes that while there may be terrorism and criminal activities converge, the methodologies used to combat each of them are very different. Based on its own risk assessment, each Government must determine the level of resources that can be adopted and applied to counter-terrorism measures, particularly given the emphasis that the Strategy also places on addressing and preventing the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism. against women instances when and therefore, 5 impact anti-terrorism conventions, increase training for countries with In prescribing counter-terrorism measures, care must be taken by the international community to preserve the tenet of due process. Care must also be taken to guard against the creation of disincentives that negatively service-based economies. With respect to counter-terrorism measures, the Bahamas has adopted new legislation, ratified additional increased security of large facilities, airports, docks and harbours developed a counter-terrorism intelligence network and provided anti-terrorism the police. Needless to say, such initiatives present a challenge and divert resources from our economic development. The Bahamas reaffirms its commitment to fulfil its obligations to major international drug and counter- terrorism conventions and continues to support the concept of the expansion of the membership of the Security Council. The Bahamas maintains, however, that such expansion of the Security Council will not the chances greatly for our particular countries, such as the Bahamas. While it is incumbent on Member States to fulfil their obligations that come with membership, the Organization must put in place effective management tools and create a system that would eliminate overspending and waste and create more fiscal accountability and proper oversight. The Bahamas values the role of the United Nations as the custodian of the interests of the worlds people, in particular the poor and the vulnerable. The Bahamas continues to believe that the United Nations Charter constitutes a viable and firm foundation on which the Organization can balance and achieve its objectives: to maintain international peace and security and, equally important, to promote development and economic and social progress.
