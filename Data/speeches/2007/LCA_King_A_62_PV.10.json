{"speech":{"0":" The pleasure is mine at this juncture, to join the other Members of the United Nations family in congratulating you, Mr. President on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We wish you success in all your efforts and assure you of our full cooperation. We also wish to your predecessor, Sheika Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for the diligent manner in which she spearheaded the work of this body at its sixty-first session. to express our appreciation 32 laid to rest in Saint Lucia In similar vein, we express our continued support for the endeavours of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. We are confident that he will continue to provide committed leadership to this Organization in the defence and promotion of its noble principles and values in every corner of the globe. I begin my address on a sad note. It is with much pain that I must inform this body that the person who brought Saint Lucia to independence and consequently to this body and who, but for the will of the Almighty would have addressed you today — Sir John George Melvin Compton, our first and latest Prime Minister — was last Tuesday, 18 September. Our nation and region suffered a great loss, but we remain committed to seizing every opportunity to carry on his lifes work of aiding the cause that needs assistance against the wrong that needs resistance, and in so doing continue to honour him. What I am about to say reflects his thoughts on and aspirations for this Assembly and for the United Nations Organization in general. We note that a significant part of our journey towards the realization of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been covered in terms of time and that in some respects there has been some achievement to date. However, it is also true that only mixed progress, regionally and internationally, has been recorded so far. Millions continue to live in conditions of abject poverty, despite the commitments made in 2000 and 2005. The sad fact is that a great deal of work still remains to be done, and urgently, if we are to achieve the MDGs and see real changes in the conditions of existence for such large numbers of people. We would be well advised to embark upon a period of serious reflection and stock-taking, an exercise involving an honest assessment of our achievements and failures, with a view to repositioning ourselves as necessary to ensure that we achieve the noble objectives the Millennium Development Goals by the projected year 2015. On our own front, Saint Lucia has made significant the achievement of the MDGs. We intend to continue on a steady path towards that end. Not only has the country attained universal primary education, but a programme of universal access to free secondary education for our young citizens has been introduced. strides over the years set out towards in life and regional and in the including including indicators, international toward a reduction the elimination of communicable diseases Saint Lucias progress in the health sector is also evident. Over the last 25 years, the country has experienced significant improvements in most health- related expectancy, immunization coverage and infant mortality, while significant reductions have been experienced in respect of lifestyle-related illnesses. A universal programme of free health care is currently in the early stages of implementation. Over the years, too, Saint Lucia has consistently worked incidence of non-communicable diseases. Serious attention has also been given to combating the HIAIDS problem, which remains a major challenge to Saint Lucia and other countries in the Caribbean region. Efforts to address this issue are being pursued, mainly through education, stigma associated with this disease, early detection and treatment programmes and the provision of free or subsidized antiretroviral drugs. As a small island developing State, Saint Lucia finds it beneficial to undertake this daunting task through cooperation. Accordingly, through the Pan-Caribbean Partnership against HIAIDS, we collaborate with other countries in the wider Caribbean region in addressing the pandemic. While this regional mechanism, which includes the 15 members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) as well as other countries in the wider Caribbean region, has facilitated our cooperative approach to addressing this challenge, it is clear that increased and sustained international cooperation is critical to our efforts if we are to succeed in our fight against this disease. In this regard, we welcome the assistance being provided by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, working with other partners, and we look forward to its continued support. thank our traditional friends and donors, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, France, the European Union and the Commonwealth, to name the most prominent, who over the years have provided much financial and technical assistance to our country and to the region. We also welcome the contribution of those other States and that have demonstrated their readiness to work with us in the realization of our development objectives. We are, of course, always willing to develop new beneficial to collaborate with all who relationships and this opportunity institutions Let me take to 33 its for this in all efforts geared support requiring cooperation understand and appreciate our efforts and our principles. In this regard, we take special note of the announcement by Norway of its pledge of $1 billion over 10 years to support the Millennium Goals on child and maternal support. Within the context of South-South cooperation, Saint Lucia will continue to work with other developing country partners in its quest for economic and social development. In the light of the positive benefits gained from cooperation programmes with those partners, we remain convinced that, according to the United Nations Development Programme Administrators report on issue, South-South cooperation is one of the main drivers of development the integration effectiveness, activities of development the organizations in the United Nations system. Saint Lucia therefore welcomes continued United Nations towards strengthening and advancing South-South cooperation. We are convinced that this cooperation modality should be strengthened in partnership with our developed country partners and other stakeholders and should therefore complement rather than substitute for North- South cooperation. The Government of Saint Lucia reiterates its commitment to the ideals of regionalism and to the deepening of the integration process within our region. Saint Lucia continues to partner with sister States of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States and the wider Caribbean Community (CARICOM) to develop mechanisms, including the Eastern Caribbean States Economic Union and the Caribbean Community Single Market and Economy, to enhance the prospects for improving the quality of life of our people. We therefore welcome the assistance of this body and that of those who have travelled the road to regionalism before us. Saint Lucia is pleased to note that Haitis march toward democratic governance, recommenced just over one year ago, continues to be assisted and sustained by the generous efforts of the international community. While we had hoped for a longer mandate period for the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti in that country, we accept the decision of the Security Council to extend that mandate to enable it to continue to work towards ensuring that Haitis political and social stability are restored and maintained. this We the Saint Lucia recognizes increasingly globalized and Under no circumstance should Haiti be left stranded in midstream, as the consequences would be too catastrophic to contemplate. We continue, therefore, to call for the sustained release of pledged development resources so that the Government and the people of Haiti may continue to meaningfully, and in a sustainable manner, address the numerous challenges facing their country. Saint Lucia places great importance on the follow-up of the international development agenda espoused in the Monterrey Consensus on financing for development. Given the plethora of challenges confronting developing countries such as Saint Lucia in inequitable international economy, financing for development continues to be key to the achievement of the MDGs and the internationally agreed development goals. important commitments made over the years by some developed country partners with regard to development finance. We also appreciate the pledges made to significantly improve the level of official development assistance (ODA) in order to achieve the goal of 0.7 per cent of developed product. Moreover, we are pleased about the Group of Eight decision in 2005 to forgive the debt of some African countries, and its more recent decision to double development assistance to Africa. these commitments, development assistance declined in 2006. Moreover, development financing continued to be subject to conditionalities imposed by donors and failed to meet and support the nationally defined priorities of developing countries. It is our hope that the 2008 Doha Review Conference will seriously address those concerns in the light of the significance of financing for development at this stage of our journey towards 2015. Saint Lucia is well aware of the increasing interdependence that characterizes this international community, the importance of building partnerships and the need to work within a multilateral framework in order to meet the challenges of this century. For this reason, we welcome the continued search for ways to reposition the United Nations system so it can better fulfil its mandate in accordance with its Charter. While we are conscious of the magnitude of the task of reforming the United Nations, we remain confident that lament, however, that, despite countries domestic gross 34 continues to underscore Member States will bring the requisite political will to bear on the process. the Saint Lucia importance of social and economic development, basic human rights, mutual respect and goodwill among nations, and their relevance to the maintenance of international peace and security. For these reasons, we are concerned that peace and security remain the exclusive preserve of the Security Council and a few select Member States. Saint Lucia continues to support reform and expansion of the Security Council aimed at making it more representative. It is our hope that this reform would reflect the role and contribution of developing countries in helping to resolve the ever- growing and increasingly complex challenges of todays world. Many, if not all of our countries celebrate our sovereignty with pomp, ceremony and pride, and in accordance with that sovereignty, we take our seat in this body. All of the rules and requirements for membership are spelled out in the Charter of our noble institution. Within this body our relationship with our partners is based on a commitment to the principles of mutual respect and understanding. For this reason, we recognize that the Republic of China — Taiwan — a democratic country of over 23 million people, has continued to abide by the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, although it is not a Member of the United Nations. Taiwan has made significant contributions to global development by providing economic and technical assistance to other developing countries in their pursuit of development and their attainment of the MDGs. We believe that sovereignty is derived from the will of peoples and from the realization or actualization of the right to self-determination. We are therefore saddened that the will of the people of Taiwan, expressed by representatives, continues to be ignored by this body. Saint Lucia therefore looks forward to the day when Taiwan will assume its place alongside other countries of the world in the halls of this Organization. For small States, peace and security are critical to their sustainable development. Thus, the spread of small arms to our region continues to be an especially disturbing issue and is a major contributing factor to crime and insecurity. This situation is particularly ironic given the fact that neither arms nor ammunition their duly elected in islands and are produced in our region. We therefore call on those States that produce small arms and ammunition to enact appropriate measures to reduce their illicit export, which threatens the security and stability of the Caribbean. Saint Lucia and other small island developing States continue to express concerns about our extreme vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change. Small low-lying coastal areas are threatened daily by the impact of a rising sea level, while others are already experiencing the untold effects created by the increase in the melting of polar ice and the consequent loss of significant portions of their land mass. For us, this climate change issue is directly related to our development. It threatens the very core of our social, economic and political security. It threatens our very existence. The dangers we face as a result of the hazardous level of greenhouse gas concentrations the atmosphere are well known and documented. Urgent, resolute action is therefore required to reverse this situation. Saint Lucia welcomes the efforts currently being made to place the issue of climate change more visibly on the agenda of the United Nations. We acknowledge the recent G-8 commitment to work positively within the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to address the issue. We maintain the view that this important issue should be discussed within the appropriate forums in order not to lose sight of the real development-related objectives that vulnerable small island developing countries like Saint Lucia are seeking to promote. Saint Lucia joins with other members of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) in calling for the problems of the rise of sea level and climate change to be addressed as a matter of urgency. We will continue to play our part through the development of appropriate national development strategies and the creation of mechanisms to enable us to mitigate against and adapt to the adverse impact of climate change. We stress, however, largest producers of greenhouse gases must bear the responsibility for the damage being caused to the global environment and in countries whose particular sustainability and very existence are increasingly threatened by their actions. vulnerable the that the to 35 for to the to the full that the small should seek in Indonesia implementation of We remain concerned international community has yet to honour its responsibility and commitment the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. We insist on the urgent and proper mainstreaming of the Strategy into the appropriate work programmes of the United Nations agencies and international conventions. We look forward to the thirteenth meeting of the Conference of Parties on Bali in December of this year, where we hope significant negotiations will be launched with a view to seriously addressing the disastrous effects of climate change on small island developing States. It is our wish that this Conference of Parties to achieve substantial and legally binding emission reductions in the shortest possible period, as well as explore ways to significantly increase the level of resources available to developing countries, and island developing States, in particular, to assist in adapting to the impacts of climate change. While economic and trade policy reform, in principle, holds much promise for small developing countries, community must understand that the “one size fits all” approach to trade arrangements is inappropriate and unrealistic and will not advance the cause of equitable global economic development. This approach has led to a reversal in many small States of the progress made through hard work and sacrifice by their populations. This fact is most evident in the case of Saint Lucia and other small banana- and sugar-producing countries of the Eastern Caribbean. The mindless application of inappropriate rules has caused much pain among the same populations that are being challenged to meet the MDGs. Saint Lucia therefore reiterates its call for the establishment of a set of trading rules flexible enough to take into account the concerns of small States, assist them in promoting economic development, provide opportunities for their people and, consequently, assist them in achieving the MDGs by the stipulated deadline date. Lastly, and looking towards the future, children are impacts children the disproportionately, seriously affecting their ability to achieve.
