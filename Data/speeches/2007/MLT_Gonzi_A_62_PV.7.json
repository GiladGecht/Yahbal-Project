{"speech":{"0":" I would like, first of all, to extend my congratulations to you, Sir, on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty- second session. I am convinced that you will guide the General Assembly through its important deliberations and challenges. I assure you of my full support and that of the Maltese delegation. I also take this opportunity to express the appreciation of the Maltese delegation to the outgoing President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her untiring work in facilitating a constructive dialogue among all the United Nations Member States. Once again, the General Assembly is meeting to consider and debate international issues that impact on the heart and soul of the world populations. We are concerned with the life and survival of those that do not have a voice to cry out against the injustices, underdevelopment, human rights violations, gender 34 child and the is “our that initiative led to labour satisfaction I note with secure world, which discrimination, poverty, environmental degradation. Malta applauds the efforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon who, since taking up his office, has validly been making a solid contribution towards a more shared responsibility”. The challenge of global climate change, particularly of global warming, induces me to make a few remarks about this environmental threat and its serious economic and social impacts which will impede progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. I am very proud of the fact that almost 20 years ago, in 1988, my country, Malta, raised awareness about the grave repercussions of climate change through an initiative which led the General Assembly to declare that “climate change is the common concern of mankind.” Eventually, the adoption of the Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol. remarkable participation in last Mondays high-level event. The Secretary-General was unequivocal in outlining the challenge the world community is facing today. He said: “Much has happened since those early days. the remains But unchanged, and has become even more pressing. Indeed, I am convinced that climate change, and what we do about it, will define us, our era, and ultimately the global legacy we leave for future generations.” (Press release G9) The disastrous effects on local populations that weather extremes are having as a result of global warming, such as Hurricane Dean, which, the Assembly will recall, devastated the economies and infrastructure of the island States of Dominica, Saint Lucia, Jamaica, Martinique and Guadeloupe, and other small island States in the Pacific and the Caribbean. All of that requires the United Nations to strengthen its leadership in dealing with natural disasters. Malta believes that the issue of climate change and its repercussions must be addressed in a more the cohesive and concerted manner among all international It is imperative that all actors involved in climate risk reduction take a unified stand on a strategy and action institutions and organizations. fundamental challenge to strengthen the resilience of affected countries in building their ability to face and adapt to the adverse impact of climate change. Malta also believes that the United Nations should establish a mechanism through the General Assembly which will report on the activities in the field of climate change throughout the past 20 years and propose elements of a possible future global strategy which avoids the current fragmented approach and takes special account of the needs of small island States. We owe such an effort to present and future generations. Malta looks forward to decisions at the Bali summit next December that we are sure will orient and accelerate action within the United Nations framework to obtain agreement on a comprehensive, effective, fair and urgent global strategy to limit climate change and adapt to its impacts. In a few weeks time, Malta together with the international community will be celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the initiative launched also by Malta on the law of the sea, which, 15 years later, saw the adoption of the United Nations Convention, declaring the seabed and its subsoil as the common heritage of mankind. Forty years after the launch of the Maltese initiative and 25 years after the adoption of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, we can safely state that this concept could also be appropriately applied to the global environment, with the knowledge that this priceless possession is owned by all human beings on this planet. The environment is our common area, our common heritage and as such it is our global concern. As States Members of the United Nations, we must work together to ensure that this precious possession is protected and enhanced. The maintenance of a special focus on furthering dialogue, peace, stability and prosperity the Mediterranean and the Middle East is one of the primary objectives of Maltas foreign policy. Together with other European Union member States as well as with our Mediterranean neighbours, Malta will continue to join in the calls for creating the necessary conditions for strengthening peace and cooperation in the the Euro- Mediterranean Barcelona Partnership, the Five plus Five Summit, the Mediterranean Forum, the Euro-Med Parliamentary Assembly the Parliamentary Assembly for the Mediterranean complement Maltas region. Maltas participation and in in 35 to two-State solution long-standing vocation and commitment to, and understanding of, the Mediterranean region. Malta is proud to host the headquarters of the newly established Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean which will meet for the first time in my country this November, launching a new dimension of discussions on Mediterranean affairs. Close to Mediterranean affairs in the order of priorities is the Middle East, with the Palestinian question at its core. Malta intends to continue, as it has done for many decades now, to support efforts to bring lasting peace in the Middle East. We find the economic and social repercussions on the living conditions of the Palestinian people worrisome. We remain concerned about the security of the State of Israel and of the Israeli people. We are troubled by the continuing violence between Israelis and Palestinians, as well as among Palestinians, violence that continues to claim innocent lives on both sides. Malta will persist in working with the United Nations and the concerned parties for a the Israeli- Palestinian question. Malta supports the decision of Prime Minister Olmert and Palestinian President Abbas to meet regularly in their quest for a durable and long- lasting solution. We also welcome the appointment of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair as the special representative of the Quartet and the initiative of President Bush to convene a major meeting on the issue in November of this year. the protection of human rights worldwide. The Human Rights Councils first year of existence has witnessed the successful conclusion of its institution-building process. Malta predicts that the universal periodic review will become an effective and a proactive mechanism that not only provides an appraisal of Member States human records but also rights encourages further achievements. Malta welcomes the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by the General Assembly (resolution ). Linked to the promotion and protection of human rights is the right to life. It is Maltas belief that the abolition of the death penalty would enhance respect for the protection of the right to life. Malta also commends and welcomes the Secretary-Generals decision to appoint a Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide with the “responsibility to protect” and A centrepiece of our Organization is its full support reiterates international the United States, we with an expanded mandate to cover cases of mass atrocities. This year is the tenth anniversary of the Rome Statute which established the International Criminal Court. Malta and commitment. My country intends to work with the United Nations and the States parties to the Rome Statute, to ensure that the International Criminal Court strengthens its tools in the administration of justice, reconciliation and the promotion of the rule of law and democracy. Two weeks ago, the international community joined the people of the City of New York to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre. While grieving with those who have lost their loved ones and with all the people of reaffirm our commitment with States Members of the United Nations in the fight against terrorism. The completion of negotiations on a United Nations comprehensive convention against terrorism would complement and strengthen the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and the Secretary-Generals Counter-Terrorism Committee Implementation Task Force in addressing the threat of terrorism to global peace and security. Allow me to touch on another subject. The plight of internally displaced persons and those who are seeking a better life elsewhere has continued to be one of the priority issues of the international community. Indeed, Malta has for some time now been witnessing that tragic human migration, caused primarily by internal conflicts, poverty and underdevelopment, and resulting in a large influx of asylum seekers arriving irregularly on our small island State, which, at 1,200 persons per square kilometre, has one of the highest population densities in the world. The impact on us is therefore enormous. I would like to reiterate the calls made by Malta in this same Assembly last year for a concerted response from the international community, as well as from institutions and organizations, particularly the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner in addressing the problem appropriately and adequately. The response should be undertaken particularly by combating that are financially benefiting from illegal immigration while criminal organizations the United Nations, for Refugees, its the 36 they put the lives of those same immigrants at risk, and by providing special assistance to those countries which, like Malta, carry a disproportionate burden in addressing the phenomenon. Malta hopes that the High-Level Dialogue on International Migration and Development held last year and the follow-up meetings will continue to find support in establishing a comprehensive institutional and holistic response to international migration and solutions that I hope will be based on the values of solidarity, on respect for human dignity, and on the sharing of responsibility. In a months time, the United Nations will be hosting the High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development with a view to reviewing the six areas of the Monterrey Consensus. The detailed report of the Secretary-General recommends a series of policies for action by United Nations Member States and other stakeholders in advancing and consolidating economic growth, sustainable development, and social progress. As rightly pointed out by the Secretary-General, and development, finance initiatives” “The Monterrey Consensus embodies a major commitment ... to keeping fully engaged at all levels ... and to continuing to build bridges and among trade (, organizations para. 127). In that context, the roles of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are crucial. In addition, the conclusion of negotiations on the Doha development agenda would significantly contribute to the sustainable development of developing countries. better equipped In order to ensure that the United Nations is the mission and to accomplish to the including strengthen mandates given to it by its principal organs, the ongoing process of reform has to be accelerated. The World Summit in 2005 agreed on a number of reforms, and especially on the need to restructure the main United Nations bodies, the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the Security Council. Progress has been made, but, I submit, more progress has still to be achieved. Malta is an advocate of a stronger United Nations that is representative of the whole membership, transparent in its role and actions, and accountable, efficient and effective in its management. It is also in that context that Malta strongly system-wide supports efforts coherence of the United Nations operational development activities. The reform of the United Nations and the proposed establishment of the “One United Nations” country approach are, in Maltas view, two important pillars on which our Organization can appropriately address the new and growing challenges it is facing. Member States must give the United Nations a new face, a stronger meaning and an innovative way of thinking, implementing and acting. The United Nations, our Organization, must be given the ability to respond, the capacity to effectively coordinate and deliver, and the means to truly reflect the aspirations of its whole membership.
