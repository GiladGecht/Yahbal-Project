{"speech":{"0":" I would like to express my sincere congratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. My delegation also wishes to commend his predecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her leadership of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session, particularly in addressing the difficult issues that continue to prevent revitalization of the General Assembly and reform of the Security Council. My delegation offers its full cooperation and support to continuing with the Organizations overall reform agenda and addressing the many challenges ahead. As this is the first General Assembly session to be convened since the appointment of His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon as Secretary-General, my delegation takes this opportunity to assure him of Naurus firm support and full cooperation in his leadership of the United Nations. I am deeply honoured to be addressing this body for the third consecutive year, this time as the recently returned leader of our small island State of Nauru. As members are no doubt aware, when I first took up office, three years ago, my country was on the brink of collapse. While Nauru was once a small donor country with a high income, our wealth was squandered in a single generation through gross mismanagement and corruption on the part of previous Governments. Our past record of poor governance and the need to rebuild Nauru were that our national the Presidents commitment the main reasons towards 6 sustainable development strategy was initiated by our Government and given one of its fundamental goals: the establishment and operation of a transparent and accountable Government. My Government is slowly but diligently working to improve Nauru. Over our three-year term, we will continue to do so, on a platform of both economic and political reform, together with good governance. We believe that we are improving our situation, and the August election results tell us that we have our peoples confidence. But it is a slow and painful recovery, and we appreciate all the help that we can get. We appreciate the fact that the United Nations is strongly aware of the development challenges in the Pacific region and that it is also cognizant that assistance has not translated into uniform human development gains in many places, with the result that the Pacific is in danger of missing many targets of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In that respect, my delegation welcomes and supports the Presidents intention to hold a leaders meeting on the MDGs during the present session. During the general debate at the sixty-first session (see ), we noted in this historic Hall that the offices and agencies of the United Nations had no permanent presence in many of the small island developing States of the Pacific. In June 2006, it was announced that a coalition comprising the United Nations Development Programme, UNICEF and the United Nations Population Fund would open a total of eight new offices in Pacific island countries, including my own country, Nauru. We welcomed that historic announcement, the progress that it marked towards harmonization with the assistance and support that the new offices would provide in developing national capacity and meeting the MDGs. As Member States that pay our dues, deploy peacekeepers and discharge our responsibilities in the international community, we deserve offices that enhance the relevance of the United Nations and the implementation of its policies. We have therefore been severely disappointed by the lack of progress in establishing acceptable offices in our countries since the announcement. The delaying of that initiative, and the assumptions on the part of the United Nations concerning the capabilities of our small island States to the United Nations and definition the relevant report of cohesion between the Organizations recruit staff for such offices, are also short-sighted. Moreover, of “partnership” for the initiative places a significant burden on our national Governments. It fails to respond to our national priorities and our lack of resources, and therefore weakens the Organization and our countries. Despite the lack of visible progress, we are of the view that the project can be salvaged with its original intentions and goals intact if there is a will and a sincere desire to respond to our needs. So we ask the General Assembly and the Secretariat to ensure that offices befitting the ideals and the reputation of the United Nations are opened in our countries. We want to see the United Nations on the ground in Nauru and throughout the Pacific region, providing a helping hand in our pursuit of sustainable development. There can be no doubt that our Pacific region is doing its best to implement the commitments made under the Mauritius Strategy and other international agreements regarding small island developing States. The the Secretary-General () makes that very clear, showing that under its Pacific Plan, the Pacific region has agreed to and is vigorously pursuing its own sustainable development priorities, which reflect and acknowledge our international commitments under the Strategy. The Secretary-Generals report and the Pacific Plan updates show progress identify important initiatives for follow-up action. However, it is also quite clear that we and the United Nations need to do much more. That fact is glaringly obvious the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which warns of a narrowing window of opportunity available for slowing down global warming and climate change. This is an issue that reveals some of the the current world development paradigm: the small island countries contribute very little to the problem but are likely to be the worst affected. The need to do more also stares us in the face from recent reports on the progress, or lack thereof, in achieving MDGs. Our region is struggling in many areas of the MDGs, and it is fair to say, as the that persistent Secretary-Generals capacity constraints are a key obstacle the in some key areas and report notes, inequities in in the recent report of to relatively small size of implementation of sustainable development in the Pacific region — this includes Nauru. Therefore, I take this opportunity to express my peoples warmest appreciation to our development partners, led by Australia, Taiwan, New Zealand, Japan, the European Union and others, for their support in this and other areas, without which we would have completely collapsed as a nation and as a people. However, I hope the Assembly can appreciate that our region, although vast, suffers both from isolation and the its countries and populations. Even with the best practices in management and governance, our economies sustainable development is impeded by high transportation costs and diseconomies of scale. In Nauru, freight adds at least 15 to 20 per cent to the cost of all imports. Likewise, affordable and sustainable alternative energy forms are a high priority for my country and region because, with the ever increasing cost of fossil fuel, we are having to pay a high premium for something that contributes both to global warming and to our potential demise as Pacific islands. Professor Jeffrey Sachs has rightly said that, while we all need to work together to solve world poverty, the opportunity is there for the developed countries with their resources and technology to do something about ending it once and for all. The agreed official development assistance (ODA) target of 0.7 per cent of a gross national product is far from being achieved. This highlights the opportunity for the world to do much more to both alleviate poverty and remove the constraints that frustrate the progress of many developing countries. Like other highly indebted countries, mine is doubly burdened by a massive debt left to us by previous Governments. After careful assessment of Naurus development potential for the next thirty years, we have come to the sad conclusion that Nauru will only be able to service a very small portion of that debt. We will need to seek the forgiveness of those countries and institutions to which we owe most of the money. This Organization prides itself on being inclusive and on being a champion to everyone; yet my delegation is extremely disappointed that, despite the efforts of Nauru and other allies of this cause, the United Nations continues to ignore the expressed wish 7 the Secretary-General, signed by of Taiwan and its 23 million people to become a member of this Organization. On the 19 July this year, an application for membership to the United Nations was delivered to the Office of the democratically elected President of Taiwan, His Excellency Chen Shui-bian. Unfortunately, the United Nations Charter and the rules of procedure of the Security Council were then contravened. Owing to poor legal advice, the Office of the Secretary-General failed to forward Taiwans application for membership to the Security Council, citing General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) for its failure. Even though many Member States continue to hide behind resolution 2758 (XXVI), it should be realized that this resolution does not declare that Taiwan is a part of the Peoples Republic of China, nor does it preclude Taiwan from future membership of this body. It certainly does not support the so-called one China principle. Ever since the establishment of the Peoples Republic of China on 1 October 1949, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been governed separately, with neither side exercising any control or jurisdiction over the other. Let me be absolutely clear: Taiwan has no intention of representing the Peoples Republic of China. Taiwan is a free and peace-loving sovereign State, and its democratically elected Government is the sole legitimate Government of their island State. Apart from the legal and moral rights of Taiwan to be part of the United Nations, there is another dimension that needs to be taken into account. Taiwan is one of the largest economies in the world, including being one of the larger trading partners of other Members of the United Nations. It is also one of the top twenty sources of world foreign investment and is well positioned to assist many of the members of this body in their development, which it has already demonstrated. Taiwan is a very important investor and trading partner for my country and others in my region — even for those that do not recognize it formally. the Secretary-General to uphold the integrity of this pre- eminent Organization and conform to the United Nations Charter and the rules of procedure of the Security Council. It must immediately accept and My delegation calls on the Office of submit to the Security Council Taiwans application for membership. Peoples of the world look to the United Nations and to their leaders to identify and act on major global challenges that confront the world today. Earlier this week, we concluded a High-Level Event on Climate Change. Our discussions encompassed a variety of views and proposals that we all hope will lead to global resolve to achieve significant changes. Nauru takes the view that the international community, particularly those countries with the capacity that comes with their status as developed nations, has a responsibility to provide financial, humanitarian and other assistance to small island developing States that stand to suffer the most dire consequences of global climate change. Of course, we must acknowledge and express gratitude for those aid policies that have been proposed and established, but more is needed to avert a potential disaster, especially to the vulnerable small island nations. Therefore, we ask that ongoing efforts be continued and urge Member States to consider increasing their financial support, including easier access to the Adaptation Fund. investments alone are not sufficient. Technology, skills and knowledge are required to guide us in our response to the present challenge. Furthermore, civil society and non- governmental organizations must cooperate with each other in acquiring and building the capacity we need to address this problem. renewed, revitalized and more responsive United Nations now more than ever. We need to see the strengthening of this multilateral institution through the revitalization of the General Assembly and comprehensive reform of the Security Council intergovernmental negotiations. All of that must move forward with a common vision for a more coherent United Nations system capable of delivering as one, sparing no efforts to continue strengthening the three pillars of peace and security, development and human rights. Nauru is of the view that the comprehensive reform of the Security Council will not be complete without Japan, India, Brazil and Germany as permanent members. situation demands a However, capital The world through 8 In closing, I wish to remind this Assembly of the Secretary-Generals recent observation of the United Nations, whereupon he stated: “The true measure of success for the United Nations is not how much we promise, but how much we deliver for those who need us most.” () As we move forward our discussions on the many challenging and complex issues before us, let us do so with the best of intentions, and more importantly, let us make good our promise to deliver. Finally, while I stand in this great country of the United States of America, the land of the free, I cannot help but remember that its people have put their trust in God. On my island country of Nauru, also a land of the free, we have placed our belief in Gods will first. Therefore, to every human being on our planet Earth, I beseech each and every one of us to dedicate ourselves to hold true to our Gods will. "}}
