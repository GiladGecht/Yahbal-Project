{"speech":{"0":" May I start by expressing to you, Mr. President, my Governments congratulations on your election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. Let me also use this occasion to thank the outgoing President, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for the excellent manner in which she presided over the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. Every year the General Assembly provides the worlds leaders with an excellent opportunity to focus our attention on the challenges we commonly face. While some of the challenges can be addressed nationally, the most critical are often not confined to national borders and therefore require a concerted global effort. Hence the centrality of the United This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of speeches delivered in the other languages.

(E) *0751956* the I once again call upon While our continent has been consolidating peace and security, there are persistent problem areas that need attention. Today in the Great Lakes region, those who committed genocide in Rwanda in 1994 continue their destructive activities. Almost 14 years after their deeds in our country, they are still sowing mayhem in the region. They rape, murder, terrorize and plunder with impunity. Their leaders are active in Africa, Europe, America and other places, where they continue to promote the ideology of genocide. There can be no doubt that those terror groups constitute a threat to international peace and security. The presence of the costly United Nations peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has not diminished their activities. international community, in collaboration with the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to end the threat posed by those negative forces once and for all. Rwandans and the region as a whole need peace and stability so that we can concentrate on the business of economic growth and development. For our part, we pledge renewed commitment to making our contribution to the restoration of peace and stability in the Great Lakes region and in other parts of our continent. In that respect, we express our solidarity with the long-suffering people of Darfur and commit ourselves to contributing to peace efforts in that part of the world, in close cooperation with the Government of the Sudan, the African Union (AU) and the United Nations. Rwanda welcomes Security Council resolution 1769 (2007) authorizing the creation of the United Nations-AU hybrid peacekeeping force in Darfur, and calls for its speedy deployment. In the same spirit, we urge the international community to support peacebuilding efforts in Somalia. It is critical that resources be made available on an urgent basis to enable the deployment of the pledged peacekeeping forces by African countries. Through the United Nations, we express our collective determination to promote socioeconomic transformation for greater and more rapid wealth creation, which in turn will permit improved lives. On that note, we also join the many other countries that are putting forward the suggestion of a moratorium on the death penalty as a way of improving those lives and valuing them. That challenge remains daunting in the developing world, where extreme poverty still affects millions of people. the to our include The solutions to permit greater associated widespread is not sufficiently increased productive capacities on the part of the developing world, side by side with the opening of global markets to the developed world trade and investment. A fair global trading system is central to wealth creation. Improving the quality of development aid would supplement that effort, based on a shared understanding that aid is most effective when it is aligned with national development priorities. Our ultimate goal of improving lives globally cannot be realized if the challenge of climate change and environmental degradation tackled. Rwanda appreciates the convening of the high-level meeting on climate change by the Secretary-General earlier this week. We also look forward to the United Nations climate change conference scheduled to take place in Bali, Indonesia, this December, which should provide a clear road map of how we are to consolidate our gains and gather pace in protecting our environment. The global challenges of poverty, ignorance, terrorism, conflict and climate change require us to act collectively in a manner that the founders of this Organization captured eloquently in the words “We the peoples of the United Nations”. As we begin this sixty- let us second session of recommit and responsibilities for realizing peace, prosperity and freedom above any narrow interests. Only then can we hope to realize the ideals contained in the Charter of the United Nations “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war” and to “promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom”.
