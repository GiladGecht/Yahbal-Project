{"speech":{"0":" Allow me President issues: three along with some of the conclusions that can be drawn from it. Let me begin with the Millennium Development Goals. We must bear in mind that over half of the time originally allotted for achieving the Goals is already behind us. Yet, have we actually reached half our goals? As Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reported here 20 days ago, there are reasons to doubt that we have. Some achievements can be regarded as noteworthy progress, for example greater access to education, a marked reduction in infant mortality, debt relief for developing countries, an increase in access to information and communication technology for people in developing countries, and so on. We have also made certain progress in the fight against HIAIDS. At the same time, however, progress in the spheres of trade and development cooperation has been modest. From the Secretary-Generals report, it is clear that, although the donor States have increased their official development aid, the actual flow of financial assistance in the course of the past two years has actually decreased. The European Union, of which Estonia is a member, is on the whole, on track towards increasing its development aid to 0.7 per cent of its gross national income, the objective agreed at the United Nations. Estonia has steadily its share among international donors; our development aid has grown fourfold since 2004. In addition to the actual decrease in development aid, we suffered a serious setback when the Doha Development Round of trade negotiations stalled and where the main theme has been a more efficient integration of developing countries into a world trading system based upon equality and regulations. I would now like to set forth several positions based upon matters of principle that Estonia regards as essential, and which are also part of the United Nations Millennium Declaration. First, every nation is primarily responsible for its own development. In order to ensure their proper development, developing countries must strengthen their capacity, intensify their fight against corruption and put their economic environment in order. That is the only way to create conditions suitable for an efficient mode of administrative infrastructure increased and 7 High levels corruption, transferring development aid and for increasing the benefits of the aid received. inefficient of administrative capacity and an unresponsive economic climate make it difficult for donor-nation public opinion to support increases in development aid. In a word, our electorates — and here I am of course speaking of democratic countries with free and fair elections — do not understand why their taxes are spent that way. Secondly, donor States and organizations can enhance the effectiveness of development cooperation by mutually coordinating and standardizing the procedures involved in development cooperation. Finally, I would like to stress that Estonia strongly supports British Prime Minister Gordon Browns and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moons initiative, the Millennium Development Goals Call to Action. The objective is to inform the general public of the importance of fulfilling the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals programme. This year, Estonia also joined that initiative. I personally hope that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was right when he said that the MDGs are still achievable if we act now. the International Day for Natural Disaster Reduction. In that connection, as opposed to the fight against poverty or diseases, we cannot of course set objectives for ourselves that can be expressed in monetary amounts. We can, however, formulate and implement measures that can help to minimize the dangers and threats to people and their property, and to avoid or reduce destruction the environment. We can thereby limit losses and alleviate the suffering of people. That, in turn, can prevent the social that natural catastrophes have on repeated occasions triggered throughout history. In the case of humanitarian catastrophes, be they natural or man-made disasters, it is of the utmost importance that help arrive on the scene as quickly as possible and that the access of humanitarian experts be ensured, regardless of their nationality or the State or organization that they represent. Unfortunately, there have recently been a number of occasions when various countries have permitted help from abroad only under very specific conditions. As a result of such The second Wednesday of October infrastructure to physical convulsions economic is and in policies, it is the weakest and the most vulnerable who suffer the most. As I said earlier, I would like to talk about recent and ongoing events the southern Caucasus, specifically the military conflict between Georgia and Russia. There are a series of complex issues involved, but here in the General Assembly I would like to raise one fundamental question: What do those events mean for us, the United Nations? To begin with, we must realize that the principles governing relations between States have been seriously damaged. It is regrettable in the extreme that the basic principles of the United Nations as enshrined in the Charter, such as the unacceptability of threatening the use of force or actual aggression against a nations territorial integrity, were grossly and grotesquely violated. Those principles must be and must remain the bases for the activity of the United Nations and the Security Council. Therefore, we have the right to demand and ensure that the United Nations be capable of convincing one Member to withdraw its military forces from the territory of another sovereign Member State and to terminate its aggression. The capacity of the United Nations to fulfil the expectations placed upon it cannot be dependent upon whether said Member nation chooses or not to act according to the good practices of international law. In the alternative case, the United Nations loses its reason for existence. We cannot allow international law to be followed selectively and only when convenient, for then it is no longer law. Russias behaviour in the weeks following the cessation of combat activity that, unfortunately, even in the first decade of the twenty- first century, it is possible to refuse to adhere to international treaties, to interpret them arbitrarily and to observe international laws only when it serves ones interest. A permanent member of the Security Council should be especially committed the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. That forces us once more to conclude that, in the interests of the to improve the capacity of the United Nations to regulate and resolve conflicts. Looking at recent events, it has become quite clear how important it is to proceed with the reform of the Security Council. The previous months events in the southern Caucasus raised another issue. Even before the armed international community, to fulfilling showed us imperative is it and 8 to determine and apprehend conflict broke out, Georgia was the target of a cyberwar aimed at Government websites, as well as those of news agencies and banks. In the case of cyberattacks and cyberwarfare, it is becoming ever more difficult the perpetrators. As I stated last year from this very rostrum, cyberattacks are an international problem — indeed, a form of aggression — that no nation is able to deal with on its own. Cyberattacks can be launched against any nation on any continent, and from any continent. Administering and policing the cyberworld to avoid criminal and hostile attacks requires extensive cooperation and relevant international regulations. I call upon all United Nations Member nations to deal with the risks associated with cybersecurity with the utmost seriousness. Estonia, which has extensive experience dealing with and repulsing cyberattacks, its expertise to thwarting that new form of criminal warfare. "}}
