I also thank the Secretary- General for his resolute efforts to promote the United Nations and its values. European Union. Our world is facing unforeseen challenges, such as climate change and the food crisis. The current economic turmoil also requires decisive action. At the same time, we have not been able to rid ourselves of conventional crisis. Unfortunately, armed conflicts are still a reality all over the world. Too often, we — the international community — are unable to agree on a Finland aligns itself with the statement of the This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of speeches delivered in the other languages.

The Copenhagen Climate Change Conference will take place in December next year. It is evident that global commitments need to be implemented and also supplemented by national and regional action. include all stakeholders, from non-governmental organizations to private enterprises, and from individual citizens to Governments. We need everybody; it is necessary that women too can participate fully in this work. Industrialized countries have to bear their share in mitigating climate change. However, international negotiations on the new climate regime cannot succeed without extensive participation by the developing countries. We must actively support the most vulnerable developing countries in adapting to and combating climate change. that poverty, especially in rural areas, can be reduced by sustainable management of natural resources. Forests are crucial in reducing greenhouse gases. Finland has a long history of sustainable forest management, and we understand its impact on rural development and employment. We would like the United Nations to intensify its efforts to assist Governments and communities to improve their capacities for rural development and sustainable forest management. We are of course ready to work with others in this respect. I am pleased to be a co-host, together with the President of Liberia, Ms. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, my friend, of the International Colloquium on Womens Empowerment, to be held in Liberia next March. The conference will address womens role in climate change, security, governance and leadership. food prices are a challenge with worldwide consequences. Once again the poorest and the most vulnerable — women and children — suffer the most. Food shortages lead to deterioration of diets, and can provoke social unrest. Effective Government action and improved donor coordination are crucial in tackling food crisis. The United Nations Comprehensive Framework for Action is an excellent initiative in addressing this global challenge. Parallel to the short-term response, attention must be paid in enhancing food security. Support for the rural sector is crucial for sustainable and equitable development, growth and well-being. Moreover, the promotion of long-term policies to medium- and Rising the and civilian the best personnel the food good agricultural practices is among approaches to adaptation to climate change. This food issue can also provide opportunities. If developing countries are supported in the spirit of the Aid for Trade agenda, they can better take advantage of their agricultural potential, including exporting. And we need to ensure, again, that both women and men benefit from support, keeping in mind that women produce most of in many developing countries. The United Nations currently deploys well over 100,000 military in peacekeeping operations. This is a remarkable figure, and we, the Member States, must continue to support the United Nations efforts in this field. The United Nations and regional organizations should work closer together in carrying the burden in preventing and resolving conflicts. Increased cooperation should be extended to the African Union. We already have good cooperation and experience in our own region, because improving efficiency and improving cooperation between the European Union and the United Nations remain a top priority. In Kosovo, and most recently also in Georgia, we continue close cooperation between the United Nations, the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. That is why I also dare to say that increased cooperation should be extended to the African Union. A continued United Nations peacekeeping presence in Chad and in the Central African Republic would contribute to wider stabilization efforts, both locally and regionally. Tackling todays multifold conflicts requires a comprehensive Trade, development policy and humanitarian aid need to be utilized alongside traditional crisis management tools. We must — even better than today — take women and children into account in conflicts and post-conflict peacebuilding. We have made good decisions. We have to make them become reality. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that last Friday Finland published a national action plan on implementing Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). We hope that more and more member countries will do the same. approach security. to 2 strongly supports justice.

Finally, I want to share my memories and experience. I had the privilege to co-preside over the Millennium Summit with President Sam Nujoma of Namibia eight years ago. We witnessed leaders having the spirit and the courage to adopt the Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals. It is our duty to fulfil these commitments. Africa requires our devoted attention and support, as was agreed yesterday. Let us work for it, because today, in this Hall, it is once again time to pledge our joint commitment to the ideas and values of the United Nations. the Everyone present may Charter calls us to do: “to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security”. While the concept of security has changed and become broader, the onus is on us to follow this call of the Charter and translate it into action. "}}
