{"speech":{"0":" The people of Fiji warmly congratulate Mr. Miguel dEscoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. We also convey our sincere gratitude to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim. I am particularly happy also to acknowledge the presence of the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Mr. Derrick Sikua, one of the Vice- Presidents of the General Assembly and a member of our region of the South Pacific. is addressing several issues of critical global interest: the global food crisis; climate change; peacekeeping; and the law of the sea. All of those issues are of great and direct importance to small island nations such as Fiji. I will first briefly touch upon some of them. The people of Fiji have been affected in a very real, immediate, serious and tangible way by the shocks transmitted to our small nation with the dramatic escalation in global food prices, energy price rises and the downturn in the global economy. In Fiji we are using these adverse external developments as an opportunity to revamp our long-neglected agricultural sector. We have ample land resources, and we must put them to better and more productive use. The food crisis and the need for self-reliance unfortunately run counter to the emergence of world trading rules. The principle of free trade dictates an open economy. Yet small developing economies like ours in Fiji need to protect our agriculture to ensure food security. We very much hope that international trade negotiations and multilateral and bilateral trade deals will enable us to protect agricultural development in our small, vulnerable economies. Fiji will support all concerted efforts, public and private, national and multinational, regional and subregional, that are being pursued to address the global food crisis. 24 On the issue of climate change, Fiji looks to, and is relying on, the leadership of the Assembly President. This is a critical issue for the very small island and atoll nations in the Pacific. While the rest of the world continues endlessly to debate the implications of climate change, in the very small islands and atolls in the Pacific the problem is very much upon us. It is now a present and very real danger. It poses a serious risk to regional stability and security. I appeal to the international community and its system of institutions to enhance efforts to assist us to address the threats of global climate change. We need investments in adaptation measures. We need to move from rhetoric to a more pragmatic and speedy response. We call upon the agencies and our regional partners to coordinate efforts to ensure that we in the Pacific region have the capacity, both human and institutional, to deal with this new threat, especially as it is getting stronger. The observed and potential impacts on our peoples and ecosystems due to climate change are all too real and immediate. We count on the President and the Secretary-General to exercise more vigorous and active leadership on this issue of global climate change. I will now speak briefly on peacekeeping. I convey our gratitude and appreciation to outgoing Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guehenno for his dedicated of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO). He was fair and generous in implementing the reforms within DPKO and the development of a United Nations peacekeeping doctrine that will guide future United Nations peace operations and missions. We wish Mr. Guehenno well and assure his successor, Mr. Alain Le Roy, of our full support and cooperation. Fijis soldiers have a proud track record in United Nations peacekeeping operations — a record of professionalism, discipline, compassion and ability. Fijis Military Forces have shown that their training and ethics are an asset to peacekeeping operations. We continue to work very hard to keep that exceptional record intact. Yet despite that, the relationship between Fiji and DPKO has been under strain. That is because of Fijis militarys involvement in our Government since December 2006. We are, however, encouraged by the ongoing discussion between officials of our Permanent Mission of Peacekeeping Operations. It would be less than honest of me if I did not observe that undue external influence the Department leadership and the Department at in appears to have been brought to bear to exclude Fiji from participation in new peacekeeping missions. I express the hope that the opportunity will be extended to us to participate in new peacekeeping missions. Please allow me to now address this body on Fijis current situation and on our efforts to take the country forward. I should first like to look back, albeit briefly. Fiji became independent on 10 October 1970. Our country then was seen as having great promise and potential. Our people, with high hopes, placed their faith on our countrys leaders to build a new nation that would be peaceful, stable, culturally vibrant, tolerant and prosperous. We felt then that by being part of the international family of nations Fiji could demonstrate by example the way the world should be. For just over 15 years following independence, we achieved some progress. However, following the coups of 1987 and 2000, the rot set in. Since then, Fijis overall political, economic and social situation has continued to deteriorate. Our peoples dream of a tolerant, united and prosperous nation was replaced by a different reality — a reality characterized by political instability, economic stagnation, increasing religious and racial intolerance, ethno-nationalism and politics based on ethno-nationalism, a rise in crime, violence and corruption, increased poverty and the emigration of many of our talented, skilled and experienced citizens. On 5 December 2006, a political transition took place in Fiji following an intervention from the Fiji Military Forces. Interim measures were put in place by the President to ensure good governance, maintain law and order and stabilize the economy. The President of Fiji subsequently appointed an interim Government, which I head. The legality of those actions has been challenged and the matter is now before the courts of Fiji. To date, my Government, which remains in effective control of governance in Fiji, has done everything within its power to adhere to the current Constitution. We recognize that that is the supreme law of our nation. At the same time, we have also come to recognize that the very foundation on which we have sought to build our nation has been shaky and weak. Therefore, our efforts must now focus on re-laying a more solid foundation to return Fiji to sustainable democratic governance. Our island nation must be rebuilt on the solid rock-like foundations of equal 25 rights, social justice, democracy and good governance. We cannot and must not repeat the mistake of trying to rebuild again on the proven proverbial foundation of sand, which is washed away by the evils of self- interest, incompetence, intolerance and greed. In January of last year, the interim Government embarked on a comprehensive examination of our political, economic, social and governance problems. We did that to identify what contributed to the abysmal record of successive Governments since May 1987, and also to find durable and just solutions. Early in that undertaking, my Government decided to reach out to the people of Fiji to ensure that they became better aware of Fijis problems and that they all became part of the solutions going forward. We did that while being mindful of the larger issue of mandate that the events of December 2006 raised. For my part, I took the view that the interim Government must not pretend that it had the capacity or the wisdom to solve our countrys problems entirely on its own. My country, Fiji, faces deep-rooted and very fundamental problems that are both complex and structural. My Government therefore recommended to the President of Fiji that he set up a broadly representative and independent consultative body to reach out to the people of Fiji and to get them actively involved in charting the way forward for Fiji. In late 2007, the President of Fiji established a 45-member national council for building a better Fiji and officially launched what is now known as the Peoples Charter Initiative. The President invited the leaders of all major political, social, community, business and religious organizations in the country to join the national council and to contribute to formulating a peoples charter for change, peace and progress. Some, in particular those organizations that remain vigorously opposed to the interim Government, chose not to accept the invitation of the President of Fiji. They wilfully persistently rejected the call to engage in constructive dialogue and to work towards a broad consensus on the way forward for Fiji. Last year, when I addressed the Assembly, I briefly mentioned our preparations to launch the Peoples Charter Initiative. I said then that through this initiative the broad cross section of Fijis people would be fully engaged and involved through consultation and participation in developing a comprehensive action agenda, and that that would be Fijis own way of addressing its problems. Today, I am pleased to inform for all citizens; transparent the Assembly that very considerable progress has been achieved on the Peoples Charter Initiative. The overarching objective of the peoples charter is to rebuild Fiji into a non-racial, culturally vibrant, united, well-governed and truly democratic nation — a nation that seeks progress and prosperity. The vision for rebuilding Fiji that underpins that overarching objective is guided by a number of key principles, such as creating a just and fair society; achieving unity and national identity; ensuring merit-based equality of opportunity and accountable Government; uplifting the disadvantaged in all communities; and mainstreaming our indigenous people, the i-Taukei, in a modern and progressive Fiji. We embarked upon the very bold programme of drafting a peoples charter advisedly and for some very compelling reasons. We can ill afford to carry on with business as usual and in ways that continue to fragment and divide our nation. In that context, the process of drafting the peoples charter has been a unique and unprecedented one — a nation-wide participatory and consultative process of a scale and type never before attempted in Fiji. The whole process is one of empowerment the likes of which the people of Fiji have never experienced before. Too often in national governance — so-called democracies — it is the professional politicians who do the thinking for the people. While the cries and voices of the people are often heard, however, they are just as easily ignored by the elected representatives and so- called leaders. From the outset, after being appointed as head of the interim Government, I have felt that it was my duty to go to the people of Fiji in the most basic and democratic sense, that is, to consult, to actively involve our people, and to put real peoples democracy to work, house to house, in each settlement and village and in towns and cities right across the country. Through the Peoples Charter Initiative, that is what we have been doing. There are some, both in Fiji and outside, who are cynical in that regard. I am able to understand that, and not only because such a process has never ever been tried before. It is indeed a most challenging and difficult process the peoples charter process has been undertaken by the national council at arms length from the interim Government, there are those who oppose it simply to undertake. Even though and this applies to 26 that is framework because it is an initiative of the interim Government. What they recognize, but choose not to admit, is that the peoples charter process is a real threat to their positions of vested power and privilege. When I addressed the Assembly last year, I pleaded for the support of the international community to help us in the wake of all the political and economic turbulence that Fiji has experienced since 1987. I to develop a political and pleaded for support governance truly democratic, accountable, inclusive, equitable and non-racial, and which will seek to unify Fijis diverse communities as a nation. I also sought constructive dialogue and engagement with the international community and with all our bilateral and multilateral development partners. I urged the international community to support us in addressing Fijis fundamental problems. I am asking the international community today not to focus only on the removal of a Government. That has already been done exhaustively. We have been subjected to harsh international measures, which we accepted. We have endured those through the suffering of our people. The coups of 1987 and 2000 were executed in the interests of a few and based on ethno- nationalism, racism and greed. The events of 5 December 2006 were not for any such extremist motivation. In 2000, in quelling the civilian-led coup, as Commander of the Fiji Military Forces, I played a pivotal role in the handing of political power to a civilian Government. Through the Peoples Charter Initiative, I am seeking to empower the people of Fiji at large and to find just and sustainable solutions to our deep-rooted and persistent problems. I wish to assure the international community that I am personally deeply committed to breaking the cycle of coups. Equally important, I am committed to breaking the cycle of bad and unjust governance that Fiji has suffered since May 1987. To remove the coup culture and to commit to democratic and just governance and the rule of law, it is racial supremacy and that further the interests of self-seeking political, religious and traditional elites are removed once and for all. In good faith, I anticipated that the international community would rally behind and extend support for such goals to help move Fiji forward. Regrettably, so far that has not happened. that promote that policies imperative the To the contrary, since December 2006 punitive measures have continued to be taken against Fiji. Travel sanctions continue, which are being imposed in particular by Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Those are applied to interim Government ministers, senior civil servants, military personnel and statutory board appointees. Those sanctions have had significant adverse effects on our economy, as well as on the functioning of our key State institutions, on which we rely to promote good governance and accountability. Pressure has been exerted on regional and multilateral agencies not to extend to Fiji much-needed financial, development and technical assistance. As a result, we have not been able to make as much progress as we should have. We cannot travel and engage in discussions at important regional and international meetings abroad. That is despite the fact that Fiji has made every effort to engage in dialogue with our bilateral partners and international community in a constructive and transparent manner. We have openly embraced and allowed various missions sent by regional and international bodies such as the Pacific Islands Forum, the European Union, the United Nations and the Commonwealth secretariat. We extended to all of them our fullest support and cooperation in terms of engagement, in arranging appointments and them whatever information they needed. That demonstrates that we are keen to engage constructively in dialogue with whoever is interested in helping move our country forward. Following the recent Pacific Islands Forum meeting in Niue, I wrote last week to the Forum Chair and indicated that the interim Fiji Government is prepared to re-engage with the Forum Joint Working Group and that we are prepared to welcome a visit, before December 2008, by the Forums Ministerial Contact Group. We are not able to schedule an election to return Fiji to parliamentary democracy in the early part of 2009, as earlier anticipated. We realize that that has caused concern to some of our own people in Fiji, to countries of the region and to some of our development partners. The stance international community with regard to the delay in convening the election, however, has given much ammunition to our opponents within Fiji. They have used it to vilify us despite the progress that we are making towards just and sustainable solutions to our fundamental problems. in making available taken by the to 27 consultative process just because some people remain opposed and have decided not to participate. My Governments task now is to persuade those opponents to come aboard, to join and to contribute. We hope to and must achieve consensus. At this particular juncture in the history of our nation, leadership is more about how we can seize the present historic opportunity to manage the transition from the interim Government to a truly democratic Government and nation consisting of various ethnic communities but which is one nation with its people in unity in the true spirit in which the United Nations was established. In conclusion, I reaffirm Fijis commitment to the United Nations and to the various United Nations conventions on human rights, the rule of law and democratic governance. We do not seek any special exemptions those conventions. All we seek from the United Nations is its understanding of our particular circumstances and the complex situation of Fiji. We invite the Organization to work with us to assist us to rebuild our country and move it forward. "}}
