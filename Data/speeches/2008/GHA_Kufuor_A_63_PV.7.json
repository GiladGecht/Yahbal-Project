{"speech":{"0":" Let me take this opportunity to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your very inspiring statement yesterday (see ). Its 12 increased support from all Members vision and compassion should provide a framework for the deliberations of the General Assembly into the future. I should also like to thank the Secretary-General for his unequivocal resolve to use his tenure to provide accountable leadership to this global institution. His call for in restructuring and streamlining the Secretariat he leads to ensure more flexible, efficient and effective tackling of the many global challenges confronting humankind is timely and must be heeded. The unmistakable fact of our time is that the world is in a state of flux with unmatched challenges aptly described yesterday by you, Mr. President, as a confluence of large-scale interrelated crises. That is befuddling all nations, strong and weak, rich and poor; but, as you and others have also observed, there are tremendous opportunities as well. Examples of the challenges that practically all previous speakers have alluded to include the phenomenon of climate change and its attendant snow-melts, tsunamis, floods and droughts; the difficult-to-explain turbulence in the crude oil market; the soaring prices of food; the upheavals in the world financial market; the massive trafficking in drugs and weapons; and the spate of harrowing acts of terrorism in many parts of the world. While some of those problems are natural, many of them are man-made. On the other hand, the advent of information and communication is effecting magical changes in awareness and making time, space and boundaries virtually irrelevant to human interactivity around in medicine are improving the quality of life and life expectancy. Fast transportation, dramatic feats in engineering and bioscience technologies with the promise of turning even deserts into productive land are unleashing unimaginable wealth among nations and individuals. Collectively, those opportunities are diffusing power around the world, to such an extent as to negate any idea of a few nations having hegemonic sway in human affairs. Indeed, the era of the explosion of knowledge can be said to be fulfilling the biblical saying that humankind has been created in the image of God. Humankind is increasingly showing limitless creativity, which inspires a vision that it is indeed capable of overcoming the challenges of our time. However, the the world. Discoveries technologies leadership, for which There must be the United Nations in problem is one of whether we will curb our self- centredness, greed, bigotry and petty inhumanities to allow for the sharing of the outcomes of that creativity. Left to our individual nations, the peoples of the world will not be high-minded enough. The main challenge then becomes how the various peoples of the world will accept their common humanity as the centrepiece of their endeavours. the Organization seems to have been created. The founding fathers must have instinctively believed that, with time, the Organization would evolve into a global Government. For even as there were marked geopolitical considerations in the establishment of the United Nations, the Organization was also imbued with a powerful streak of morality. With time, the moral streak has been steadily overcoming the geopolitical dimension. That perception is what must drive the entire membership to accept the call for reform of this global institution and its agencies so as to make them accountable to Members and, in turn, make Members accept their authority and direction. Indeed, the only Organization to command respect across the board. Under its auspices, strong and rich nations alike are showing increasing tendencies to share knowledge and finance resources with the weak and poor. Fellow-feeling in international relations is also deepening. It is my belief that it is through the Organization that the world will eventually achieve peace, stability and prosperity, following the menacing flux that engulfs all of us now. It is the same moral streak embedded in the United Nations that is propelling the development of the various regional blocs around the world. In the case of Africa, dramatic improvements have been made in the last decade and a half. The African Unions Peer Review Mechanism demonstrates the great resolve of African nations to adhere to the rule of law and good governance. It is noteworthy that, as of now, close to a majority of the membership of the Union has signed up for review. It is also significant that many more African leaders are today acceding to power through the ballot box. Meanwhile, under the auspices of the New Partnership for Africas Development, Africa is trying to pool resources among its members, in partnership with others outside the continent, to exploit its huge the world with the potential is 13 efforts to achieve and are uncoordinated While we appreciate potential and to develop its markets and its energy, telecommunication, transportation and agriculture sectors, among others. That is the way to solve the many problems of poverty, illiteracy, disease, ignorance and conflict. It is Africas initiative to mainstream itself into globalization, and is receiving the support of the international community. Evidence of that includes the many joint conferences held with Japan, China, Brazil and India, as well as Africas old allies in Europe and North America. the support from our development partners, I must say that there is still room for improvement, especially as regards the continents the Millennium Development Goals. The various existing forms of assistance insufficiently substantial to achieve the Goals by the target date of 2015. In that regard, the Secretary-Generals call for review and quick delivery of support is timely. As observed in the Accra Accord of the twelfth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the whole idea of aid is to empower beneficiary countries to stand on their own feet and to become effective partners in the global market, from which neither rich nor poor countries can abstain, given the increasing interdependence of the world. In January 2001, I was sworn into office as liberal democratic President of Ghana on Constitution with the same strong streak of morality that I see in the Charter of the United Nations. The Constitution acknowledges the centrality of humankind in all endeavours; hence the provisions for respect for human rights, law, gender balance, accountability and transparency in governance. But, in 2001 the national economy was in bad shape and Ghana had to sign up for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative (HIPC) in order to access funds for various reconstruction projects for which credit lines were difficult to come by. With national determination and great discipline, the HIPC completion point was achieved in record time to earn debt forgiveness of about $8 billion from bilateral and multilateral creditors. That success has led to foreign investment that have enabled the Government to launch, among other social services, a free and compulsory universal basic education programme and substantial developments in both the second-cycle and tertiary levels education. inflows of domestic and the rule of increased In the health sector, the first-ever national health insurance scheme, including free maternal care, has also begun in Ghana. Concurrently, heavy investments are being made in infrastructure in the transportation, energy and telecommunications sectors in anticipation of accelerated growth in the economy. Meanwhile, a process to modernize the countrys agriculture through mechanization has begun to improve the welfare of the more than 60 per cent of society that is rural and depends on the sector for its livelihood. By those policies, among others, the nation is now in sight of attaining its ambitious vision of middle income status by 2015, which is also the target date for the Millennium Development Goals. Those developments have been crowned by the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, which the Government is determined to make a blessing for the whole nation of Ghana, rather than a curse. That is the Ghana story as my term of office comes to a close at the end of this year. The moral I glean from the story is that development in freedom is possible. accelerated national development and good governance, including respect for fundamental human rights, are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, good governance should hasten development. "}}
