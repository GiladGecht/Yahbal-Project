{"speech":{"0":" My delegation would like to exercise its right of reply in response to the statement made by the representative of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. That statement is entirely groundless, and we cannot accept it. Japan has been facing up to its past with sincerity and consistency. Japan has officially expressed a sense of remorse and apology many times since the end of the Second World War. With that in mind, Japan has, for more than 60 years, consistently dedicated itself to promoting international peace and prosperity and demonstrated its respect for democracy and human view to a 39 to to that The the position It must be noted fundamental policy of Japan rights. Japan has adhered consistently and exclusively to a defensive security policy based on the principle that it should never become a military Power, and we have adhered international problems have to be resolved not militarily, but always peacefully. that Japan has sincerely addressed this issue in the past and continues to do so. It must also be noted that Japan has served as a non-permanent member of the Security Council nine times since it joined the United Nations, some 50 years ago. We are of the view that Japan has been making positive contributions international peace and security by discharging our responsibility as a member of the Security Council. With regard to Japans position on Security Council reform, as we have publicly stated many times at the United Nations and in other forums, and as is well known, Japan stands ready to contribute actively and constructively to international peace and security at any time. remains unchanged. On the basis of the Pyongyang Declaration, Japan will normalize its relations with the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea through the settlement of the unfortunate past and the comprehensive resolution of outstanding problems, including abductions and nuclear and missile issues. Mr. Al-Barout (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in Arabic): I apologize for taking the floor at this late hour. I would like to reply to what the representative of Iran just said. Those false claims regarding Irans sovereignty over the three islands, Abu Musa, greater Tunb and lesser Tunb are unjust and illegal. My delegation has always held an unswerving principled position on those islands and reiterates its great disappointment at what the representative of Iran has just repeated, as his delegation does every year. The representative of Iran cannot falsify all the demographic, political and historical truths, which show that those islands belong to the Emirates. We have never relinquished and will never relinquish our legal, historical and political right to those islands, which are an integral part of our sovereign territory and our exclusive economic zone. We repeat that that territory along with its continental shelf and airspace, is ours and cannot be divided. We categorically repudiate all the false claims and illegal measures to the We repeat our appeal Mr. Pak Tok Hun undertaken by Iran concerning those islands. We base our position on the United Nations Charter and international law. international community to urge Iran to show its peaceful good intentions in the region by entering into unconditional bilateral negotiations between our two countries regarding the occupation of the islands, or by taking the matter to the International Court of Justice to bring about a solution, as is the practice in other cases. We reiterate that stability and economic progress in the Arabian Gulf require good-neighbourly relations in line with the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and non-interference in their internal affairs. (Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea): My delegation would like me to reply to the remarks made a moment ago by the delegation of Japan. The Japanese representatives remarks attempt to divorce black from white, as if Japan were doing something to redress its past crimes. In adopting the Pyongyang Declaration of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea and Japan in September 2002, both Governments agreed to redress Japans past crimes against the Korean people during the Japanese occupation of Korea, the issue of missing Japanese and other pending matters. As part of its efforts to implement the Declaration, the Government of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea dealt with solving that issue sincerely and with great generosity. In keeping with the Pyongyang Declaration, upon the request of the Japanese Government we made investigations into the missing persons of Japan, and we informed the Japanese Government that, of the 13 Japanese war abductees, we sent the five surviving abductees and all to Japan after their children informing the Japanese Government. Recently, in the last month, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea and Japan agreed to undertake another investigation into that issue. So far, we have done everything we can, and we will do our best to solve the issue. However, Japan has not shown any tangible willingness whatsoever its responsibility properly to redress its past crime. Japan has refused to honestly admit to and repent of the heinous crimes it committed against humanity during the illegal military to fulfil 40 the occupation of Korea in the past and has persistently evaded responsibility for those crimes, although the old century has been replaced by a new one. In his remarks a few minutes ago, the Japanese representative said that Japan repented sincerely, but in fact we are very concerned about the irresponsible remarks distorting the historical facts — the crimes committed by Japan. Very often, high officials of the Japanese Government distort the real facts. For example, on 4 March 2007, the then Japanese Prime Minister refused to admit Japans responsibility for the issue of comfort women by making reckless remarks, such as that there was no evidence proving the forcible recruitment of comfort women for imperial Japanese army. It is a historical fact that Japan forced 200,000 young Korean women into sexual slavery for its imperial army. Is there any such army in the world in the history of war that took girls and young women as their sexual slaves? It is only Japan. On 25 March 2007, Japans Deputy Cabinet Minister asserted that there were nurses or journalists for the Japanese army, but no comfort women, and that there were prostitutes who were sold by parents. Such irresponsible remarks come out very often. I do not want to talk any further about the crimes committed by Japan. He mentioned the few Japanese abducted — a few more than 10 Japanese. But that is the tip of the iceberg compared to the great crime against humanity committed by Japan in the past, including the massacre of 1 million Korean people, forced labour of 8.4 million Koreans and sexual slavery of 200,000 Korean women for the Japanese army. But Japan has been evading its responsibility for the crime for more than 60 years. For Japan to honestly settle its criminal past would be to win the trust of all the people and become a member of the international community with a clear conscience. Japan had better discard its wrong way of thinking and its stance and make a political decision to redeem its past, though belatedly. Mr. Okuda (Japan): My delegation will again have to exercise its right of reply in response to the statement made by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. Japan and the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea held working level consultations in June and representative of the August 2008. At those consultations, the two sides agreed on what the aim and concrete modality of a comprehensive investigation on the abduction issue to be conducted by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. However, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea later notified Japan that it would not conduct the investigation until it could ascertain the position of the new Administration of Japan on the agreement reached at the working consultations. Japan strongly hopes that the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea will establish an investigation committee with the necessary authority and that it will commence the investigation soon. Regarding the Japanese past, as I said earlier, Japan has been facing up to its past with sincerity and consistency. However, the numbers that the delegation of Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea cites as those killed and murdered are totally groundless. It is simply not possible to justify ongoing violations of human rights with such a groundless allegation. About the comfort women, we have to say that, on that issue, the Government of Japan continues to adhere to the position expressed by Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono in his statement of 4 August 1993, in which the Government of Japan extended its “Sincere apologies and remorse”. seriously addressing the issue of its past history. (Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea): I am sorry to take the floor again. The Japanese representative has just said that the figures I gave were groundless. But Japan refuses to reveal all the facts and figures it holds in its archives. We requested, on numerous occasions, that Japan reveal all those documents. Since he said that the figure I gave is groundless, I will give the exact numbers we have got so far: 7,784,839 Koreans were drafted for forced their destination, and 200,000 Korean teenagers, girls and women were forced to serve the Imperial Japanese Army as comfort women. Well, it took half a century for Japan to admit its crime in Korea. No one knows how long it will take for Japan to liquidate the crime. My delegation would like to urge Japan and to remind Japan that without thorough elimination of the past crime, a clear future for Japan cannot be expected. Whatever pretext Japan puts forward to justify its crime, the fact remains that Japan illegally drafted millions of Korean people to Again, it must be noted that Japan has been labour without knowing Mr. Pak Tok Hun 41 forced labour as well as sexual slavery. But it still refuses to redress those crimes of the past. The President in the Chair. Programme of work "}}
