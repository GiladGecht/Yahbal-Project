{"speech":{"0":" The Malaysian delegation congratulates you, Mr. President, on your election as the president of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. We are in a situation of unprecedented crisis. The skyrocketing prices of fuel and food have caused us distress and widespread hardship. Beyond that, the current financial and climate crises continue to tear the social fabric of Member States. To term it merely an economic crisis is to understate the case. Indeed, the sheer complexity and connectivity between food, fuel and energy, between finance and climate change, make the task of addressing those convergent crises so bedevilling. It is here at the United Nations that the crises must be faced and resolved. If we fail to address and remedy those calamities, our role and responsibility in this body will be called into question. situation, particularly the food crisis, a silent tsunami. I beg to differ. It has not been and is not silent. Instead, the rumblings have been heard for some time, most particularly international community gathered in Rome to address the global in Africa. In 1974, Some have current called the the 34 for greater food crisis, and in 1996, again in Rome, we dedicated ourselves at the World Food Summit to eliminating hunger and malnutrition and to achieving sustainable food security for all. We adopted seven commitments towards that end. It was estimated in 1974 that, if action was not taken, there could be 680 million hungry people in the world in 2010. The latest figure shows that, at present, 850 million people face hunger on a daily basis. Clearly, we have failed to take heed of the warnings made 34 years ago. Can we now ask what happened to those resolutions that we made? Liberalization has fundamentally changed the market structure for food and energy sources. Those changes have allowed international speculation. A clear evidence of speculation on the price of food can be found in the dramatic rise in prices. An increase of close to 40 per cent has been recorded within a six-month period, in some cases. In view of the volatility of food prices, Malaysia strongly supports efforts to promote agriculture and food production. It is generally assumed that rising food prices automatically benefit all farmers equally. That is not the case. Due to the concentrated and vertically integrated nature of the global food trade, a good number of agribusiness companies control all aspects of cultivation and distribution. We are therefore now witnessing smallholders being squeezed out. They are unable to benefit from rising prices. At the same time, ironically, many have to purchase food items that are available in the market at very high prices. The energy crisis has some of the same causes as the food situation. Underinvestment is one of those causes. Expectations of continued ample supply have been dashed due to speculation and increased demand. The causes of the fuel, food and climate change crises clearly lie in the unfulfilled hopes and broken promises of sustainable development. In Rio almost a decade and a half ago, the human family agreed that we would undertake concerted action to address the sustainable development challenge based, the principle of common but differentiated responsibility. Yet, we are facing a crisis that could have catastrophic consequences. It would appear that we have not learned the lessons of history or avoided the habit of producing resolution after resolution minus the requisite pursuit and follow-up. Indeed, that is the root inter alia, on interests of the the in many areas of the Therefore, the question is: what needs to be cause of our stagnation Organizations responsibilities. done? Allow me to make six suggestions. First, the international community, in particular the developed world, should demonstrate greater political commitment. The focus of the countries of the developed world should be on fulfilling their 2008- 2012 commitments and, in so doing, setting a standard for the entire world, rather than on trying to pass the burden of action on to the developing world. Secondly, we must find the right mix in balancing the competing three pillars of sustainable development, namely, economic growth, social development and environmental protection. Thirdly, the optimal mix between governmental and private-sector action must be found. Clearly, market forces and the private sector have a role to play in overcoming these convergent crises. However, the role of the Government is critical in terms of providing policy integration as well as balancing the competing interests of sustainable development. Fourthly, further infrastructure development and the transfer of technology are critical elements in overcoming the present crises. Fifthly, we must resolve long-standing issues that lie at the heart of world geopolitics today. In particular, we must resolve the problems in the worlds most volatile regions — which, coincidentally, are some of the worlds largest producers and distribution channels of oil. The United Nations must make a forward thrust in meeting the need for peace and security. Energy and food are truly needs of humanity. Therefore, the United Nations must introduce a synergy of human rights into the matter so that oil and food become basic rights of humanity. And sixthly, long-term solutions must be found in order to stabilize the price of commodities. More particularly, the futures market must be organized and duly regulated so that it becomes a force of stability, not volatility, in prices. That must be coupled with continued to alternative energy, be it solar, nuclear or derivative fuel. research and development three pillars of related 35 in the in to cooperate times were good. Somehow, Malaysia recognizes certain realities. In the face of vehement protests, we have taken measures to reduce the level of fuel subsidies, which could have been untenable long run. We have also undertaken measures to reduce Government spending and to promote greater energy efficiency. Last July, leaders of the Developing 8 Countries, of which Malaysia is now Chair, agreed in Kuala Lumpur to make serious efforts increasing agricultural production and achieving greater food security. We urge the countries of the developed world to play their rightful greater role in addressing those convergent crises, given their greater wealth and capacities. The present financial crisis being suffered by the United States threatens to engulf the entire world, although the vast majority of us did not enjoy the benefits when the financial mantra of the United States has lost its magic. Casting our minds back to the Asian financial crisis in 1997, we cannot help but compare the scenarios. The troubles of Asian companies then were the result of outside forces, while the present troubles of United States financial companies are entirely of their own doing. It must be asked: why were the actions taken by the Governments of Asia — in particular, that of Malaysia — to save our own companies a decade ago deemed so wrong, while the present bailout of United States financial companies is deemed to be right? To ensure that such a debacle does not recur, let us today resolve to check the excesses of the so-called financial wizards whose alchemy has resulted in so much suffering. Malaysia supports the view that corporate captains should not sap their entities by receiving unbelievably high pay packages. New threats to peace and security continue to pose additional challenges international community. Terrorism, transnational crime and piracy are but a few of the challenges that confront us. Already, the scourge of terrorism and piracy in international waters has taken its toll on many States. Malaysia, Japan and even Russia have become victims to acts of piracy thousands of miles away from their shores. Just days ago, in August 2008, two Malaysian vessels were hijacked by pirates in the Gulf of Aden. Sixty-five Malaysians and 15 Filipinos on board those vessels are being held hostage in Somalia. In order to secure the release of the hostages and ensure the safe the for navigation of our vessels in that area, Malaysia has taken steps in accordance with Security Council resolution 1816 (2008) and international law. My delegation stands ready to work closely with other States that share the same predicament. We urge the Security Council to immediately address the problem in an effective manner. My delegation also calls on States, particularly the littoral States in the region, to provide the means necessary to ensure the security of navigation in their waters. Democracy, human rights and the rule of law are three important pillars of our political life. Those pillars, enshrined in the Malaysian Constitution, have bequeathed to us freedom and liberty, dignity and harmony, peace and security. Malaysia will protect and strengthen those sacrosanct pillars at all costs in order to ensure that all members of our multireligious and multi-ethnic society can continue to live with one another in peace, harmony and unity, while respecting diversity. We believe that good and harmonious relations among our various religious and ethnic groups are our greatest asset. We respect the rule of law, and no one is above the law. Malaysia is concerned over recent attempts by certain powerful Member States the national laws of countries and the administration of justice under those laws. It needs to be restated: we have no right in any form or manifestation, or under any pretext or circumstances — in the conduct of the internal affairs of other countries. If we so chose, we could question the legal basis of the Guantanamo detentions without trial, but we have not done so, inasmuch as we do not question societal behaviour jurisdictions. While same-sex fornication and marriage are acceptable in California, that does not mean that sodomy — which is a crime in many countries in Asia — is to be impugned or derided. Let us remind ourselves of the purposes and principles set out in the United Nations Charter, as well as of the relevant provisions of the 2000 Millennium Declaration and the Outcome Document of the 2005 World Summit, which should be defended and upheld. Democracy in Malaysia remains very vibrant and progressive. Basic rights continue to be guaranteed for each and every Malaysian citizen, and the rule of law via parliament remains central to our existence as a sovereign and independent nation. to meddle — to question in other 36 It is here in the General Assembly that the entire world comes together in a true spirit of common resolve and partnership. That presupposes the creation of an international order and a reformed United Nations that reflect not only the current and future realities, but also our resolve in fulfilling each and every resolution that we have adopted here at the Assembly. Indeed, it would be elementary at this juncture to answer the question: to what extent have we fulfilled and satisfied the numerous resolutions that we have adopted over the decades? Indeed, what happens to the speeches after speeches that leaders have made? Lest we be blamed as a mere resolution-producing body, let us begin to act in concert to deliver the goods that we all should have delivered for the sake of the very humanity that we are charged with safeguarding. Let us plan the work and subsequently work the plan. "}}
