{"speech":{"0":" I have come to this gathering of nations as a representative of one of the smallest nations on the planet. Seychelles is but a speck on the globe, home to some 87,000 people — a people that to 6 poverty, economic believes in justice, freedom and fairness. In this concert of nations, every country great or small has a voice. Our voice comes from the heart of a people that, like countless others, lives in trepidation. I have come here neither to beg nor to accuse, but to reach out to the conscience of all who have gathered here at the United Nations. I ask them to feel the heartbeat of humanity. When this great institution was founded over six decades ago, its architects were motivated by noble and just ideals: human freedom and dignity, justice, human rights, peace, security, harmony and development. Those ideals are values that we hold dear, timeless values that are the soul of the United Nations. I have faith in those values. So do the people of Seychelles. Have we lived up to those values? Yes, we have averted many wars. We have resolved many conflicts. But in this age of relative peace and security, new enemies are staring us in the face: hunger, pandemics, underdevelopment, turmoil, environmental degradation and the inequity of the global trading system. Those are the enemies which, if not overcome, will foundation of civilization. Those are the enemies that we have to battle and conquer to create a better world for our children and their children. Those are the battles that we have to win to save our planet. Those are the issues that the modern United Nations has to grapple with and overcome. Can it succeed? I believe it can. It can if we endow it with a new vision — a vision in which hope for mankind goes beyond rhetoric; a vision that provides for bold leadership, clear commitments and targets so that we can focus on the greater good for humankind; a vision in which leaders come together, setting aside petty differences and charting a new course for the United Nations, a new road map to resolve the climate crisis and an appropriate framework for the energy and food crisis; a vision in which appropriate institutional reforms are put in place and the adequate achieve Millennium Development Goals; a vision that encompasses justice and fairness in trade and in which the specificities of small island developing States are not only recognized but accepted as criteria for aid to further development. I believe in that vision. We can all share it; we can all help to make it a reality. Our deeds have to be resources mobilized shatter the to governed by firm commitments to and perseverance in finding sustainable, pragmatic and equitable solutions to the complex issues that threaten our very existence. We should abandon solutions that continue to enrich the rich and impoverish the poor and the vulnerable. When it comes to world trade, for example, it seems acceptable to some that wealthy countries are allowed to give subsidies to their farmers, as a result of which exports from developing countries become uncompetitive, but that developing countries are obliged to follow World Trade Organization rules to the letter, even if they undermine domestic economic policies formulated to protect vulnerable sectors of society. We offer facilities to foreign investors to exploit our natural resources, which are traded for high profits on the international market, while we receive a pittance in licensing fees. It is like taking a bowl of food from the poor and giving them back a spoonful as a generous donation. For instance, of the total value of tuna — our “blue gold” — caught and trans-shipped in our waters by foreign fishing vessels every year, Seychelles receives only 7 per cent in revenue, comprising licensing and trans-shipment fees. That situation is, to my mind, unacceptable. is unreasonable to fight for a better share of the proceeds. the prevailing situation of international waters off the coast of Somalia is of grave concern to the international community, it is of graver concern to Seychelles, whose exclusive economic zone borders that maritime zone of hazard. A little more than a week ago, some 40 European fishing vessels lay idle in Port Victoria as a result of an act of piracy on one of their own. Such acts can have a serious impact on the lifeline of the second pillar of our economy at a time when we are engaging with the Bretton Woods institutions in a process of economic reforms. I wish to thank all our partners and friends — in particular France — for all the efforts they have deployed against that scourge. The skewed nature of the global trade regime is not the only impediment to development. I return to the case of my country. The fact that we have a high human development index, ranked fiftieth in the world, and that we fall in the middle-income group of countries excludes us from access to grants and soft loans that would have helped our country to develop On a separate but related note, while I ask whether insecurity in it 7 as defined by funds, especially the denial of access Our natural environment even further and faster. And that is despite the fact that donor organizations have confirmed that all aid, grants or loans that have been given to Seychelles have been properly and accountably utilized for the benefit of our people. It is as if we were being penalized for our success in raising the standard of living of our people. We have fallen into the so-called middle-income trap. Furthermore, no account is taken of the fact that Seychelles falls into the category of highly vulnerable countries the Commonwealth vulnerability index. Why should our relative success be the reason for to special development those addressing education, water, sanitation and health? Is that the price we have to pay for improving the quality of life of our people? Is that the price we have to pay for dedicating over 50 per cent of our to environmental conservation for the benefit of the whole world? is our future, our treasure trove of biodiversity. We attach the highest importance to its preservation, not only for ourselves, but also for the rest of the world. Like many other small island States, Seychelles remains vulnerable to the threats posed by global warming, climate change and rising sea levels. These phenomena are linked to human activity on our planet that, collectively, the nations of the world have the power to influence — if only we had the will to do so. It is not right that small island States should have to run the risk of being submerged by rising sea levels while some nations refuse even to acknowledge their responsibility for the high levels of environmental pollution now threatening the planets resources. Despite our small size, we shall continue to lead. And we shall lead by example. By our example, we have shown and will continue to show to all that sustainable the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are achievable in our present generation. Through our efforts and with the support of international NGOs, we have started a global movement — the Global Island Partnership — to get all small islands and nations with islands to devote part of their natural resources to environmental resilience and sustainability. And, more recently, Seychelles set up the Sea Level Rise Foundation to galvanize global development Are action to address the devastating impact of climate change on our planet. those worthy causes not deserving of international support, especially in the International Year of Planet Earth? We are running out of time, and we must combine our resources and know-how to avoid the physical damage and social and economic toll that threaten us. Some of the greatest afflictions of humankind today are hunger, starvation and malnutrition. Today, food security is our foremost concern. The challenge for many Governments is to bring food to ordinary people at affordable prices. The dramatic increase in grain prices has led to huge increases in the price of bread, milk, meat and other commodities. The hungry are getting hungrier, more desperate and angrier. The divide between rich and poor is widening day by day. We are faced with the looming threat of starvation on a global scale and, with it, the prospect of violent upheavals. We can act to resolve the food crisis. First, there must be political commitment. Secondly, subsidies given to farmers by the industrialized countries have to be removed. Thirdly, industrialized countries should make available to the South much-needed resources to improve our infrastructure. Give us the resources, technology and infrastructure to produce more food and there will be no need to help us feed ourselves. Mankind has had a hand in most, if not all, of the crises we face today. We gather here every year in the name of freedom, human rights, democracy and sustainable development to deliver eloquent speeches. In the process, we procrastinate and bury solutions to our problems in reams of resolutions and declarations. Can we honestly say that we have got our priorities right? Can we say that we live in a just world, where every man, woman and child enjoys the same rights? Are we, as leaders, living up to the noble goals for which the United Nations was set up? Let our conscience provide us with the answers. A revamped United Nations system is best placed to facilitate progress in all the areas I have mentioned: food security, trade, climate change and energy. I am asking for a clear action plan. Multiple conferences and talk shops are not the solution. We need a fresh and effective approach to global governance and I am the territory and 8 convinced that with the right level of resources, and with the political will and commitment, we can start to tackle the fundamental flaws in our global governance and trade regimes. I am asking the rich nations to support that endeavour and assume their collective global responsibility. Let those of us who believe in freedom and dignity show solidarity among ourselves. Let us help each other to overcome the obstacles in our path. Let us focus on a global vision for the betterment of every nation. In conclusion, I leave members with this note of reflection: “History to the defeated May say Alas but cannot help or pardon ...” W. H. Audens words will define the future of humanity, in terms of its history. The time for action is at hand. We must change, or be redefined by history, like many great civilizations of the past. "}}
