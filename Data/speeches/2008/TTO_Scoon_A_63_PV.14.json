{"speech":{"0":" I am honoured to be afforded the opportunity to address the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I also wish to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. DEscoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency. I am convinced that his wealth of experience, garnered over the years in the different capacities in which he has served and his strong conviction of the importance of multilateralism and respect for international law, will be brought to bear in a most positive and productive way on the proceedings of the session. Further, Trinidad and Tobago is gratified that Nicaragua and, by extension, Central America, has been graced with the distinct honour of guiding the work of the sixty-third session. At the same time, my delegation wishes to express our heartfelt appreciation and admiration for the way in which His Excellency Srgjan Kerim of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia conducted the affairs of the General Assembly during the last session. The Secretary-General must be commended, particularly for his untiring efforts in ensuring that humanitarian relief is brought to thousands of victims of natural disasters, including in the Caribbean. Given the increasing frequency and ferocity of hurricanes and other similar climatic phenomena, there is dire need for the provision of early warning systems and capacity- building programmes in vulnerable regions like the Caribbean, and preparedness and at mitigating the effects of such disasters. We applaud all efforts to bring relief to those affected. The President returned to the Chair. The recent disasters bring into sharp focus the imperative of purposeful action on the problems of climate change at regional and international levels. Trinidad and Tobago is committed enhancing planning the national, aimed at the need promoting industrialization the nations forests. Indeed, to adopting concrete measures aimed at reducing its levels of greenhouse gas emissions, while at the same time balanced and environmental sustainability. Notwithstanding its current healthy endowment resources, Trinidad and Tobago of hydrocarbon recognizes to promote clean energy alternatives, the development of new and renewable the proper protection and energy options and management of the Government is putting into effect appropriate policies for substantial results in that area. We hope to achieve meaningful progress, in cooperation with development partners within the public and private sectors, both locally and internationally, and with civil society. Cooperation at the international level is also indispensable to efforts aimed at addressing the current energy crisis. Trinidad and Tobago is seeking to partner with its African friends in order to, among other things, identify ways of developing long-term strategies for the sustainable development and utilization of their energy resources. That is in keeping with the pledge made by The Honourable Patrick Manning, Prime Minister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, in 2007, when he addressed the eighth Summit of the African Union, in Ethiopia. Since then, discussions have ensued with individual African States and with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), to advance the initiative. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is eager to work assiduously towards the attainment of our common objectives. Trinidad and Tobago firmly believes that the United Nations must take the lead in the management of the global food crisis, in which we are confronted with a situation of losing thousands to hunger on an almost daily basis. We embrace the various multilateral initiatives to address that grave challenge, including the establishment by the Secretary-General of the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis its Comprehensive Framework for Action. The eradication of extreme poverty and hunger is one of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to be achieved by 2015. We cannot allow the threat posed by the global food crisis to reverse the strides made so far by many developing countries to achieve that Goal. We must utilize all the resources at our disposal, including a recommitment to the Food and Agriculture in April 2008 and the adoption of 26 that Trinidad and Tobago Organization of the United Nations (FAO), which was established to help developing countries and countries in transition modernize and improve agriculture and fisheries practices and to ensure good nutrition for their citizens. We must work in concert to provide that institution with the resources necessary to discharge effectively its mandates. If we fail to win the war against that common enemy, we will be compromising the right to food and by extension the right to life of millions of people. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has embraced a number of key policy initiatives that are designed to guarantee our citizens access to food of sufficient quality and quantity and to reduce the impact of the food crisis. Thousands of acres have been made available for diversified agricultural production. In addition, capital is accessible to farmers through our national Agricultural Development Bank. food recognizes security must also be pursued in the context of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy, which provides the opportunity for the integration of production and cross-border investment in agricultural production in those countries which have greater agricultural potential and resources. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago therefore hosted, jointly with the CARICOM secretariat and the Food and Agriculture Organization, a regional agriculture donor conference in June 2007. Similarly, like poverty and hunger, terrorism remains a major scourge on our societies and poses a direct threat to democratic institutions. It undermines the rule of law, infringes human rights and generally affects the well-being of its victims. Trinidad and Tobago is convinced that members of the international community must embrace multilateral solutions in the fight against terrorism. We remain committed to the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, which is complementary to our own efforts to combat terrorism. Trinidad and Tobago views the reform of the Security Council as indispensable to the transformation and further democratization of the United Nations. As a small island developing State, Trinidad and Tobago wishes to reiterate its position on Security Council reform, which emphasizes the need for, among other things, equity of access for small States to the Security Council and the need for representation of all regions the coherence aimed is imperative for required to achieve at making of the world in its permanent membership. Failure to reform the Security Council could serve to undermine that organs authority as the body with the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, as well as its ability to discharge its other obligations under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. Trinidad and Tobago is convinced that the United Nations remains the principal vehicle for meaningful exchanges between members of international community on matters of international concern. Such deliberations, in our view, constitute the bedrock of the democratization of the United Nations system and are for us a priority consideration. We recognize therefore the great value of the informal consultations on system-wide the Organization deliver as one. Further progress on that issue during the current session the United Nations development system to be able to provide Member States, particularly developing countries, with the the Millennium assistance Development Goals and internationally agreed development goals. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has charted a development policy to achieve the MDGs within the stipulated period, as well as to transform the country to developed status by the year 2020. The pace of economic growth over the past decade has fortunately enabled us to surpass MDG targets in achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equality, empowering women and significantly reducing the level of poverty. Trinidad and Tobagos development strategy exceeds the MDG targets in some respects. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has been able to provide free secondary and tertiary education to its citizens. In addition, 30 per cent of our cabinet ministers and members of parliament are women. Regrettably, for many developing States, the achievement of the MDGs within the stipulated period appears therefore urge all development partners to honour their commitments and pledges already agreed upon. Another important international process to which Trinidad and Tobago attaches great importance is the review of the Monterrey to be elusive. We the implementation of the other 27 the timing for the convening of they have not been Consensus on Financing for Development, which will be addressed at a follow-up international conference in Doha, Qatar, in November. The Monterrey Consensus, adopted by heads of State or Government in 2002, called for the mobilization of resources to assist the MDGs and in meeting developing countries coherence recognized importance of and international consistency within and among the monetary, financial and trading systems in support of overall development. While there have been some the key pillars of financing for advances under development, sufficiently far-reaching. In the light of the current financial crisis, the the follow-up conference is most timely and presents an opportunity for the forging of global partnerships in a spirit of solidarity. A key component for success will be an ongoing engagement between Governments and all stakeholders, including the private sector and civil society. Trinidad and Tobago is committed to the regional integration movement of CARICOM and has continued to provide economic assistance to our CARICOM partners within that multilateral framework and other bilateral arrangements. One such arrangement is Trinidad and Tobagos Petroleum Development Fund, a facility that only recently was drawn upon to provide substantial assistance to some of our Caribbean neighbours in the aftermath of recent hurricanes. Another is the CARICOM Trade Support Programme, a comprehensive loan facility of $16.5 million that is aimed at improving the trade capacity of CARICOM States by providing assistance in the diversification of their economies and in improving trade capacity. The Caribbean also falls prey to the nefarious trade in narcotics, to which the illegal proliferation of small arms and light weapons is linked. In an effort to confront these challenges, we have concluded with our neighbours the CARICOM Maritime and Air Space Security Cooperation Agreement to protect our borders from illegal activities. We recognize, however, the important role of the United Nations as the premier multilateral forum in providing assistance in areas such as capacity-building to augment our own resources. For the States of the Caribbean, a critical aspect of disarmament is the eradication of the illegal trade in small arms. Trinidad and Tobago therefore calls for the ambit of urgent action to complete the work on the elaboration of an arms trade treaty. In the context of our efforts to address the challenge, we also wish to call again for consideration to be given to the inclusion of international drug trafficking as one of the crimes within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC). It is of great significance to us that the very year we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute of the ICC, we also commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since its establishment, the ICC has been able to attract 100 States parties, issue arrest warrants and begin trials of persons accused of committing crimes of major concern to the international community. The perpetrators of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes show flagrant disregard for the human rights of their victims, as well as for human rights law and humanitarian law, none of which should go unpunished. The United Nations has played a seminal role in the promotion and development of international law, which has contributed the maintenance of international peace and security and friendly relations among States. As a small State, Trinidad and Tobago views adherence to and respect for the rule of law as a that could affect our bulwark against territorial independence and economic development and the general well-being of our citizens. However, we are conscious of the need for international cooperation in the implementation of international various conventions that provide mutual benefits to Member States. One area of which the United Nations can be justly proud is the conclusion of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Convention has worked well since its adoption and entry into force, and it has provided legal certainty to activities carried out by States in different maritime zones. In keeping with our obligations under the Convention, Trinidad and Tobago is in the process of completing work on its submission to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf by May 2009 its continental shelf jurisdiction beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. We do so with full respect obligations to extend intrusions integrity, under to legal 28 and the Americas the Summit of for the sovereign right of other coastal States to make similar submissions to the Commission. Our region is home to the International Seabed Authority, which is located in Jamaica. The Authoritys mandate is derived from the Convention, and it is entrusted with the responsibility to administer the resources of the International Seabed Area, which is the common heritage of mankind. As in previous years, we again call on all members of the Authority to make every effort to attend its meetings. In conclusion, Trinidad and Tobago wishes to reaffirm its faith in and commitment to multilateralism at the regional, hemispheric and international levels. Dialogue among States must always be the preferred option for solving the myriad problems that we face in an increasingly complex international environment. It is in recognition of this importance that Trinidad and Tobago has taken the bold decision to host in 2009 both the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. Dialogue in those two bodies, which are microcosms of the United Nations, could also influence discussions at the United Nations, an institution that we must continue to transform, guard and protect, in order to be able to bequeath it to future generations.
