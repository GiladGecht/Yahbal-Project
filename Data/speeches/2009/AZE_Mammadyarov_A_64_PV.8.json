{"speech":{"0":" I would like to join previous congratulating His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki of Libya on his election to the post of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I wish him every success. I should also like to thank his predecessor, Mr. Miguel dEscoto Brockmann, for his work. I would like to express my profound respect and appreciation to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the international community to make our world a better place to live. We all recognize that the security of every State of the world can be better promoted and ensured with a multilateral security system. That paradigm was a principal reason behind the creation of the collective security system that has the United Nations at its core. Yet, after more than 60 years since the founding of the United Nations, the question remains of whether the contemporary is addressing effectively and in a timely manner the multifaceted and interconnected challenges and threats confronting our world today. The global character of todays challenges and threats makes geographic distance irrelevant when it comes to the formulation of security policy, as threats as we know them today transcend national borders and entire continents. The indirect repercussions of these threats may be as devastating and as costly as their direct impact. The interconnected and intertwined nature of current threats requires that we reconsider the very concept of security in broader terms that are not confined to the traditional military aspect of security, international security architecture in mobilizing leadership for his include to fulfil its political, economic, energy, but also cultural, information and other dimensions. The security of each State and, more broadly, international peace and security will depend upon whether States follow the norms and principles of international law and use them as a guiding tool for shaping their foreign and security policies. Following a common set of norms and rules on the international arena contributes to the transparency and predictability of State behaviour and hence consolidates international peace and security. Unfortunately, the unlawful use of force has still not been eliminated from international relations. Civilian populations are still suffering today in many places around the world due to the manifest failure of individual States their most basic and compelling responsibilities. Armed conflict, military aggression and foreign occupation involving the most serious international crimes are but a few vivid examples from our recent history of the bitter consequences of non-compliance by individual States with the norms and principles of international law. Governments that fail to obey the rules of international conduct will individual liberties and freedoms at home, thus undermining democratic development. The most vivid example of misconduct when it comes to the norms and principles of international law is the almost two-decades-long, and still unresolved, Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorny-Karabakh conflict, which also stands out as a major threat to international and regional peace and security. As a result of the aggression carried out by Armenia, almost one-fifth of territory of Azerbaijan has been occupied, the approximately cleansed Azerbaijanis have become internally displaced persons or refugees and thousands of Azerbaijans historical and cultural heritage artifacts have been destroyed or looted. In its four resolutions on the conflict, the Security Council has reaffirmed the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and the inadmissibility of the use of force to acquire the territory of the other States. It has also recognized Nagorny-Karabakh as a part of Azerbaijan and called for an immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan. The General Assembly — in resolution , which was adopted infringe upon 1 million inevitably ethnically 60 its on 14 March 2008 and which is entitled “The situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan” — expressed respect and support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan within internationally recognized borders. As reflected in those resolutions, the approach of the General Assembly and the Security Council is fully consistent with the position of Azerbaijan, which from the beginning advocated a step-by-step approach to settling the conflict as the only viable option. A number of important steps have to be taken, starting with the withdrawal of Armenian forces from all the occupied territories, the rehabilitation of those territories, the return of internally displaced persons to their homes in and around the Nagorny-Karabakh region and the opening of all communications channels for mutual use. That will make it possible to eliminate the consequences of the conflict, and will pave the way for the establishment of a durable peace and stability in the region that is conducive to the establishment of the legal status of the Nagorny-Karabakh region within Azerbaijan, with due account taken of, and an equal hearing for, the voices of the Azerbaijani and Armenian communities of the region. The current settlement process offers some hope of breaking the stalemate in the process of resolution of the conflict. The acceptance by Armenia of the step- by-step approach to a settlement to the conflict on the basis of the principles and norms of international law and the decisions and documents adopted in that framework, as reflected in the joint declaration signed in Moscow in November 2008 by the Presidents of Azerbaijan, Armenia and the Russian Federation, is a positive sign. Azerbaijan is ready to continue talks with Armenias leadership for a secure and stable South Caucasus region and beyond, which will make it possible to take advantage of the existing ample regional opportunities for the benefit of all. the negative developments in the region to which I have referred, let me briefly share some information about the positive economic performance of my country. Azerbaijan has minimized the impact of the global economic downturn on its economy and managed to sustain growth. Having maintained its dynamism in 2009, as of today our gross domestic product (GDP) growth stands at almost 4 per cent. We have recorded a drop in the poverty rate since 2003, the background of Against improved in an effort implementation of such into an energy hub of from 44 per cent to 13 per cent. The Government of Azerbaijan has substantially trade and to strengthen investment conditions national competitiveness and spur private-sector development, especially in the non-oil sector. Non-oil GDP growth is at almost 16 per cent, the highest rate in 5 years. In recognition of its results-oriented reforms and thought-out economic policy, Azerbaijan was qualified by the World Bank as one of the worlds top reformers. Azerbaijan — a strategically located country with a young and skilled population, great resources and a dynamic economy — is inevitably taking a leading role in the region and increasingly becoming a pivotal player and credible actor beyond the region. The successful infrastructure projects as the Baku-Supsa and Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil-exporting pipelines and the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas pipeline have not only boosted our economy, they have also contributed the development of neighbouring States. A modern energy infrastructure coupled with vast energy resources have transformed Azerbaijan international importance. Azerbaijan has proven itself a reliable partner and an indispensable and secure energy source for Europe and beyond. Azerbaijans location at the crossroads of major East-West and North-South transport corridors and its rapidly transportation infrastructure, which is connected to regional highway and strategic importance of my country. The completion of the construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railroad and the commissioning of the brand new seaport at Alat, on Azerbaijans coast on the Caspian Sea, will increase the role of Azerbaijan as a communications hub linking Europe with Asia. Azerbaijan has also put forward an initiative to establish a Trans-Eurasian information superhighway, which is expected to serve as a major element of the East-West the provision of Internet service, telecommunications systems, e-information resources and e-economies to 20 countries of the region. Today we are living at a time of heightened religious and ethnic awareness, which in certain instances has is sometimes maliciously exploited to fuel conflicts on railroad networks, highlights transport corridor and taken exaggerated forms and developing national to the facilitate 61 in maintaining ethnic, religious or cultural grounds. The broad recognition by the Member States of the United Nations of the role of the dialogue among civilizations, and specifically of inter-cultural and inter-religious harmony international peace and security, can only be praised. We fully support the recommendations of the Secretary-General on the importance of increasing educational efforts to eliminate hate messages, distortion, prejudice and negative bias from textbooks and other educational media and to ensure a basic knowledge and understanding of the worlds main cultures, civilizations and religions. As a country where long-standing traditions of tolerance and peaceful coexistence of different religions and ethnic groups over centuries have become an inseparable part of the culture, Azerbaijan has repeatedly demonstrated its determination to act as a natural bridge bringing together different continents, cultures and civilizations through the promotion of inter-religious and intercultural dialogue based on mutual respect and understanding among peoples of different cultures and religions. Azerbaijan was among the first countries to join the Alliance of Civilizations, an initiative by Turkey and Spain. Azerbaijan has hosted a number of important events in recent years, with a view to translating into concrete actions the recommendations contained in the Alliance of Civilizations report of the High-level Group appointed by the Secretary-General. Most recently, we held the Baku International Forum on Expanding the Role of Women in Cross-cultural Dialogue, which we believe will raise awareness about the role of women in that regard. In December 2008, we hosted a conference of culture ministers from Council of Europe member States. For the first time in the history of the Council of Europe, ministers from member States of the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the Arab League Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization joined the event. The Baku declaration adopted at the conference envisages, intercultural dialogue between European and neighbouring States. the fifth Islamic Conference of Culture Ministers, Azerbaijans capital of Baku was declared the Islamic culture capital for 2009. This autumn we will be hosting the sixth Conference of Ministers of Culture of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, inter alia, an At the through implementation of where we will continue discussions of our future actions in fostering dialogue among civilizations. The multilateral system, with the United Nations at its heart, is undergoing serious changes that will test its strength, viability and credibility. This requires more dedicated efforts aimed at strengthening the United Nations and promoting the effectiveness of the Organization its decisions and resolutions. Azerbaijan believes that, as the only truly global organization, the United Nations has to be stronger and capable of engaging on a range of pressing global issues in every part of the world, as well as addressing the aspirations and concerns of each Member State. We continue to support reform of the Organization so that it may be renewed and revitalized and made more responsive. "}}
