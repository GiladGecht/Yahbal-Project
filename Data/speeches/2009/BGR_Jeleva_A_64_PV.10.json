{"speech":{"0":" I am deeply honoured to address this audience on behalf of the Republic of Bulgaria. I would like to convey my delegations congratulations to Mr. Ali Treki on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty- fourth session, and wish him success in the months ahead. Our gratitude goes to Mr. Miguel dEscoto Brockmann for his leadership and guidance during the previous session. Let me also thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his resolute efforts to promote the United Nations and its values. Bulgaria fully aligns itself with the statement made by the Prime Minister of Sweden, Mr. Fredrik Reinfeldt, on behalf of the European Union. Furthermore, Bulgaria would like to express its pleasure at the election of Ambassador Irina Bokova as the new Director-General of UNESCO. We would like to thank all Member States for the trust invested in our candidate. Bulgaria takes great pride in having such a high-level representative in the United Nations system and would like to assure the Assembly that our In the principle of issues to the reiterates The most pressing the globalized world of Government will continue to do everything it can to foster the policies and ideals of UNESCO. As a member of the European Union (EU), Bulgaria is dedicated to the spirit of multilateralism and therefore fully supports the efforts to strengthen the United Nations capacity to deliver effective international responses to global challenges. that require our attention are undoubtedly the global economic and financial crisis and the negative impact of climate change. In this light, we particularly appreciate the Secretary-Generals initiative to convene the United Nations Summit on Climate Change on 22 September. Furthermore, I would like to express our support for the statement made by the President of France at this general debate. We are indeed running out of time, and if we want to reach an agreement in Copenhagen, timely action is needed. twenty-first its full century, my country strongly commitment effective multilateralism based on international law, the United Nations Charter and the United Nations system, which place the human being and human security, rights and dignity at the very centre of international politics. Bulgaria considers cooperation in South-East Europe and the Black Sea region to be a priority of its foreign policy. Situated at a particular geographic crossroads, Bulgaria is in a unique position to assess the areas pressing issues in their complexity. Together with our partners in the EU and NATO, Bulgaria is proactively cooperating with its immediate neighbours. regional cooperation is an integral part of European integration of the strengthening of confidence, stability, security and the affirmation of European standards in the region. To this end, Bulgaria is committed to pursuing efforts aimed at combating and preventing the use of hate speech likely to create fears and tensions between groups from different social backgrounds. We therefore call for full compliance with human rights and fundamental freedoms the western Balkans. In this context, Bulgaria believes that the building of a stable, peaceful, democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo, its the western Balkans. ethnic, national, It contributes to living in peace with religious or Bulgaria strongly affirms that in 30 in involved the parties neighbours, is of primary importance to the security architecture of the western Balkans and Europe as a whole. Bulgaria is particularly interested in the peaceful long-term development of the Black Sea region. Despite active cooperation among countries in the region, much of its potential has so far not been utilized sufficiently. In this light, it must be said that the South Caucasus remains a region of concern for Bulgaria. We call upon to overcome their differences and to engage in a dialogue to ensure the peaceful and prosperous development of the entire Caucasus. Today, it is our task not only to respond to the challenges, but also to embrace the opportunities that the Black Sea region provides. Bulgaria believes that the European the strong Eastern dimension of Neighbourhood Policy addresses the needs and priorities of all the partners. We see opportunities for launching projects important sectors, such as transport, trade, energy, environmental protection and border security. My country is one of the main supporters of the Black Sea Synergy initiative, which serves as an inclusive cooperation platform between the European Union and the countries of the wider Black Sea to contribute to the success of those policies, in particular through its forthcoming chairmanship of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization. Bulgaria would, furthermore, like to thank the United States and our partners in the European Union for the constructive part they have played in both the Balkan and the Black Sea regions. We are grateful for their counsel and support, and we very much look forward to further deepening and intensifying our cooperation. The list of persistent grave risks and challenges to global security is, regrettably, not a short one. We are convinced of the need to step up efforts aimed at achieving progress international disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In this regard, the need for the full and universal implementation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty regime remains of utmost importance, and my country is dedicated to supporting a successful outcome of the 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference. region. Bulgaria will endeavour the areas of in We are deeply concerned by the recent turn of events regarding Irans nuclear dossier, and, in this respect, we strongly appeal to the Iranian authorities to comply with relevant resolutions of the Security Council and to provide their full cooperation to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Bulgaria hopes that the forthcoming negotiations between Iran and the five permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany (P5+1), scheduled for the beginning of October, will make it possible to renew the discussion on the Iranian nuclear programme and pave the way for a comprehensive solution before December this year. Bulgaria confirms its position that further reform of the main United Nations bodies is necessary. We believe it is desirable to enhance the transparency and effectiveness of the system. Furthermore, we need only recall the enormous challenges facing Member States and the international community in the twenty-first century world to see the need to reform the United Nations. Reform of the Security Council should certainly be a central element in any reform of the United Nations. We would like to reiterate our position that both categories of membership on the Council need to be enlarged. Furthermore, we believe that the regional Group of Eastern European States should be allocated at least one additional non-permanent seat. Bulgaria is well aware of the need to pursue international diplomacy in order to overcome existing conflicts. As a consequence, we welcome the positive role that the European Union plays as a mediator in numerous conflict areas around the world. One such area is the Middle East. Bulgaria firmly supports the efforts of the members of the Quartet in the Middle East peace process and believes that re-establishing direct dialogue between the Israeli and Palestinian delegations is of fundamental importance. Bulgaria firmly supports the position of the European Union in this a comprehensive and lasting peace can only be realized if live peacefully, side by side, each in its own sovereign State and in mutual recognition. the United Nations, supported by the European Union, has an enormous potential to be a force for peace and stability is in Afghanistan. Bulgaria believes that, overall, a more comprehensive in Israeli and Palestinian peoples can and underlines area where coordinated approach Another regard and the fact that the 31 Afghanistan is desirable. In this light, the Bulgarian Government thanks the Swedish presidency of the European Union for preparing a blue book listing all European efforts in Afghanistan with the aim of helping improve coordination on the ground. Together with our European Union partners, Bulgaria is strongly committed to the cause of human rights. As such, Bulgaria will continue to clearly condemn all such violations of human rights as torture, slavery, sexual abuse and female genital mutilation. Additionally, in this light, we support the call by the Swedish presidency of the European Union for greater empowerment of women and gender equality. Furthermore, we appreciate the Secretary-Generals report entitled “Implementation of the responsibility to protect” of January 2009 () as an important and timely document, and we state our firm interest in further discussing and elaborating on the concept. We hope that, with the recent adoption of resolution , this concept will be implemented. In the course of the past year, the world has faced multiple challenges related to the global economic and financial crisis. This crisis has had a huge impact on virtually all sectors of our economy. Bulgaria firmly believes that we can only overcome the crisis through the joint efforts of all relevant actors. We are all in the same boat, and we must all ensure that the lessons of our past mistakes are learned and remembered. To that end, we call the cooperation between developing and developed countries. Additional support should be provided to developing countries further aggravation of global poverty and hunger. More broadly, we are more concerned that the global recession might lead to a decrease in the total level of official development assistance. Greater attention should therefore be paid to the conclusions put forward in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness of 2005 and the Accra Agenda for Action of 2008. Furthermore, while we are well aware of our financial constraints, Bulgaria, as a country that only recently emerged from the status of a recipient of foreign aid, is committed to live up to its international responsibilities and is determined to be a force for peace and stability. It is true that the efforts of the United Nations for peace, stability and development constitute an impressive list of achievements. It is also true that a lot more could and should be achieved this year and in the years to come. At the end of the day, however, the intensification of to avoid for further in order achievements of the United Nations depend on what we, the Member States, are willing to do. We have a shared responsibility for the future of our planet. Only through open and honest cooperation can we be successful in overcoming the challenges ahead. So let us work together, demonstrate beyond any doubt our goodwill, flexibility and commitment, and make this sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly a real success. "}}
