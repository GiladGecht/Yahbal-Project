{"speech":{"0":" Thank you, Mr. President, for allowing my delegation to exercise its right of reply in response to the statement made by the delegation of Eritrea. The statement that the members of the Assembly just heard was an expression of denial and defiance the international community, as described earlier by our head of delegation, Mr. Roble Olhaye, in his statement to the Assembly this morning (see ). Without wishing to become involved in a sterile and futile discussion, my delegation simply wishes to refer to concrete facts that various regional and international organizations were able to observe during their fact-finding missions, carried out since the beginning of the crisis between my country and Eritrea. towards 44 I wish Moreover, The conclusions of the United Nations fact-finding mission — to mention just one — are unequivocal. Eritrea has rejected all mediation and cooperation initiatives aimed at resolving this crisis. In addition, the adoption on 14 January 2009 of Security Council resolution 1862 (2009), which very clearly condemned Eritreas occupation of Ras Doumeira and Doumeira Island and demanded that it withdraw its military forces to restore the status quo ante, acknowledge its border dispute with Djibouti, engage actively in dialogue to diplomatically resolve the conflict and abide by its obligations as a United Nations Member, shows that the members of the Security Council were fully aware of the scope of the problem and of the lack of cooperation on Eritreas part. that Eritrea to distinguishes itself in our region by the fact that, since its independence, it has been the source of numerous military aggressions towards several countries in the region, including Yemen, the Sudan and Ethiopia. The latest deadly provocation was the attack perpetrated against my country on 10 June 2008. Since then, we have spared no effort to resolve this crisis through dialogue, in vain. There is a very simple fact that cannot escape even Eritrea: for dialogue, there must be two parties. The denial and distortion of facts cannot be an acceptable or conceivable response when one claims to be a responsible United Nations Member. My country has always been and remains convinced that States Members of the United Nations cannot take shortcuts regarding international law, nor can they be allowed to scorn it. Thus, it is high time that resolution 1862 (2009) be implemented. opportunity to offer some clarifications. Security Council resolution 1862 (2009) and the relevant presidential statements preceding it were adopted before the facts on the ground had been ascertained. As the conflict erupted, there was a desire at the highest level on the Eritrean side to address the matter quietly. That approach was accepted by Djibouti at the highest level, only to be later abandoned and internationalized for reasons that are best known to Djibouti. Even now, Eritrea still wishes the restoration and cultivation of good-neighbourly relations with Djibouti (Eritrea): Let me Mr. Giorgio recall take this that on the basis of full mutual respect for each others territorial integrity and authority. Miss Hassan (Djibouti) (spoke in French): I am taking the floor to respond to the statement just made by the representative of Eritrea. As I just said in my previous statement, in no way do I wish to get the Assembly involved in an argument today. The facts speak for themselves. I should just like to recall that available United Nations documents prove what I just stated: that the United Nations fact- finding mission concluded there was good cooperation on Djiboutis part and a lack of cooperation and the Secretary- Generals good offices on Eritreas part. Furthermore, I am very pleased to hear that the Eritrean delegation is speaking of calm and good- neighbourly relations. I think that perhaps that is the beginning of a change in position, which is desirable. That is why I should like the Members of the General Assembly to refer to the report of the fact-finding mission (), which is an official United Nations document. the last speaker in exercise of the right of reply. As we are now approaching the conclusion of the general debate, I should like to make a brief statement. "}}
