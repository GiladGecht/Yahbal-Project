{"speech":{"0":" First, I echo previous speakers in warmly congratulating Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, of the Socialist Peoples Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I am confident that under the able stewardship of Mr. Treki, a veteran of the United Nations, the Assembly will make significant progress on many critical issues of common concern. Our tribute also goes to Mr. Miguel dEscoto Brockmann, of Nicaragua, who successfully presided over the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. the considerable challenges that our world confronts, challenges such as the current global economic and financial crisis, climate change, food and energy insecurity, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I hope that in its deliberations the Assembly will come up with new ideas to cope with those global challenges. the present global economic and financial crisis will go down in history as a landmark case of world economic meltdown. This global crisis has clearly undermined the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). While the developed countries have more possibilities and resources to cope with the slowdown, the developing countries have suffered the most, with huge losses of national income, as their economic growth is expected to fall sharply due to a drastic reduction in exports, which they have largely depended on, rising unemployment and so forth. In order to help mitigate the impact of this economic and financial disaster on developing countries, we should do everything possible to get the Doha Round negotiations back on for a successful conclusion in order to break down barriers to improve market access, particularly in agricultural goods, and reduce agricultural subsidies. terrorism and is no doubt investments, the threats of There that falling trade, track threat In this regard, Cambodia greatly appreciates the commitment that the Group of 20 (G-20) made in Pittsburgh, just two days ago, to “bringing the Doha Round to a successful conclusion in 2010”. At the same time, the Monterrey Consensus should be invigorated in order to help developing countries to alleviate poverty and meet the MDGs. Under these terrible circumstances, we warmly welcome the G-20s commitment, made in London in April 2009, to address the impact of the global financial crisis with the injection of $50 billion to support social protection, boost trade and sustain development in low-income countries, and with an additional $6 billion concessional and flexible financing over the next two or three years for social protection, including through investing in long-term food security in the poorest countries. Today, everyone in the world is increasingly concerned about climate change, which is another very serious to humanity. Global warming has triggered more and more frequent cyclones, typhoons, extreme floods and droughts. Our planet is now confronted, more than ever, with increasing natural disasters. The worsening impact of climate change has now reached an alarming level everywhere around the planet. The shrinking of the Arctic summer sea ice should be an alarm signal for everyone that global warming is inexorably advancing, and with perilous speed. the Asian Development Bank (ADB), will be the most affected region. Its vulnerability to climate change is largely a result of its geography, with low-lying nations and long coastlines. The negative impact of climate change on farming in South-East Asia would seriously jeopardize the production of rice and other agricultural products, and consequently would have ripple effects on food security, as South-East Asia is one of the worlds most important rice crop regions. Based on the estimate by the ADB, the total cost of loss in agricultural production and other negative aspects of climate change would be equivalent to as much as 6.7 per cent of the regions gross domestic product compared with the 2.6 per cent loss estimated for the world as a whole. Cambodia is essentially an agrarian country, with the livelihood of more than 80 per cent of its population depending on farming. Therefore, it is very South-East Asia, according to 15 vulnerable to weather-related disasters. Fully aware of that danger and the serious consequences of climate change and global warming for the well-being, livelihoods and development of peoples around the world, Cambodia has been assuming its share of responsibility in the matter of global warming since 2003. We have made the utmost effort to implement the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol by promoting Clean Development Mechanism projects and implementing our National Adaptation Programme of Action on climate change. We have also launched a major campaign of reforestation all over the country; more than 49,000 hectares of trees have been planted. We have also banned timber exports. In this context, Cambodia warmly welcomes the recent United States initiative to engage with the lower Mekong basin countries by sharing with the Mekong countries its best practices and experience on climate change and flood and water resource management. At the same time, the Mekong countries and Japan are now looking into an approach for the future to achieve sustainable development of the Mekong basin potential, with better respect for the environment of the mighty Mekong River. Furthermore, Cambodia commends the recent promise of the Group of Eight (G-8) at its summit in July to work towards an 80 per cent reduction in heat-trapping pollution by 2050. Nonetheless, since climate change is evolving steadily with time, we may question whether the pledged reduction can match the speed of global warming. the industrialized countries, which produce 80 per cent of gases, the greater responsibility and take more drastic and urgent measures to reduce emissions of those deadly gases. Governments around the world have just over three months to craft a new treaty to deal with global warming. It will be a historic treaty for generations to come. The United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Denmark in December could secure a milestone plan to really slow down climate change for the safety of all humankind. Therefore, Cambodia believes that all countries and all actors should join hands in international community has an December. The to reach an agreement in Copenhagen I believe that greenhouse should share 16 obligation to roll back global temperatures before it is too late. The future generations of our children and grandchildren are at stake. I turn to the subject of food and energy security. The sharp increase in oil prices last year prompted a number of countries to turn to the production of bioenergy crops as an alternative source of energy, thus reducing the available cultivated land, while the worlds population continued to grow day by day, increasing demand for food. The combination of those realities underlines the importance of a comprehensive approach to tackle the planets food crisis. The challenge we now confront is, on the one hand, how to produce enough food to feed the growing world population, and, on the other hand, how to respond to the increased need for clean energy to save the global environment and stop the advancing climate change. The solution to this twin problem is to find a balanced approach between food crop and bioenergy culture, and to develop alternative energy sources to meet the growing demand. We should avoid any short- term solution to the energy problem that would have harmful consequences for food security worldwide in the long term. Finally, Cambodia welcomes the outcome of the G-8 meeting in LAquila, Italy, with the commitment to mobilize $20 billion over the next three years to support agricultural production in poor countries. We hope that the commitment will be translated into concrete and timely action. In parallel to all the serious global challenges that I have mentioned, there remain political and security problems causing great concern. Terrorism is a threat everywhere and has caused the death of innocent people. To fight terrorism more effectively, we need stronger and closer cooperation between the many authorities concerned in order to face up to such criminal acts against humanity. Moreover, some countries with the capacity to produce nuclear weapons have not yet signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The dissemination of weapons of mass destruction constitutes another massive, deadly menace to humanity. In this context, Cambodia highly values the call by United States President Obama on 23 September to “stop the spread of nuclear weapons and seek them” (). Cambodia also warmly welcomes the the goal of a world without Security Councils resolve, expressed at its summit (see 91) on 24 September, “to seek a safer world for all” (Security Council resolution 1887 (2009), first preambular paragraph). Within the framework of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), we have the Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone, which is an important instrument to keep South-East Asia free of nuclear weapons in order to ensure peace and security in that part of the world. It is also a good confidence-building mechanism, which needs to be adhered to by all, especially the nuclear-weapon States. In recent years ASEAN has actively encouraged the nuclear-weapon States to accede to the Treaty, but there has been no concrete result or effect yet. Here also we appeal to all nuclear-weapon States to engage more constructively with the Treaty. I come now to the Korean Peninsula issue. We are all concerned about the rising tension in that part of the world, which can affect peace and security in the region. Cambodia urges all parties concerned to exercise the utmost restraint and re-engage in peaceful negotiations in the six-party talks aimed at the early denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We should call upon the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea to keep in mind that the six-party talks remain an appropriate forum to contribute to the settlement of the overall problem in the Korean Peninsula. While talking about threats to international peace and security, we should also keep an eye on the Middle East situation. The never-ending cycle of violence of the Israel-Palestine conflict must be broken. One of the most pressing just, comprehensive and sustainable solution to the problem of Palestine in accordance with the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and the relevant Security Council resolutions. Cambodia strongly urges all parties involved to cease using military force and violence, in order to foster a peaceful and lasting settlement through the establishment of a State of Palestine living side by side with the State of Israel in a spirit of peaceful coexistence and close cooperation between the two peoples. Before concluding, I should like to say a few words about United Nations reform. For many years now, almost all delegations to the General Assembly have voiced their demand for reform of the United Nations. But when it was time to act a conflict of achieve issues is to a interest arose. In my view, the reform of the United Nations should be in the interest of peace, security and development for the whole international community, and not just the particular interests of a country. The reform should also go beyond the restructuring of the United Nations organs, in order to enable this world body to engage itself more actively in revitalizing the primary role of the United Nations in world affairs.
