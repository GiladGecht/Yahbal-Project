{"speech":{"0":" My delegation and I are honoured, for the second time, to address the General Assembly on behalf of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and the Government and people of Liberia. We congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki and his country, the Socialist Peoples Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, on his election as President of the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. We are convinced that, as a consummate diplomat, Mr. Treki will bring his wealth of experience into play as we tackle the complex issues on the current sessions agenda, while entertaining hopes for a resounding success. In this context, my delegation and I assure the President of our full cooperation. Permit me, therefore, to seize the opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to the preceding President, His Excellency Mr. Miguel dEscoto Brockmann of the Republic of Nicaragua, for the very able and effective manner the Assemblys sixty-third session. His sound and shrewd leadership was critical in steadying the turbulence occasioned by the severe global economic and financial crisis. Likewise, we commend the Secretary- General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, a visionary statesman, for the unfaltering efforts with which he continues to administer the affairs of this Organization. His renewed dynamism and sense of purpose serve as an the attainment of global peace, security and development. Liberia continues to make steady progress under the excellent, leadership of Her Excellency President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Since her inauguration first democratically elected woman head of State of an African country, the Government has undertaken a number of important initiatives aimed at enhancing national dialogue and reconciliation. to our collective aspirations for in which he steered the affairs of indefatigable impetus January 2006 the as in of the the two members implementation of On 30 June 2009, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission submitted an unedited report, which did not gain the unanimous consent of the Commission, since issued dissenting views. Nonetheless, since its release the report has spurred national debate, and the President has committed herself to working with all stakeholders towards implementation of the recommendations, which must be in consonance with the Commissions mandate, the wishes of the Liberian people and the laws of our country. In order to protect the fundamental rights of the Liberian people, the President has also nominated the members Independent Human Rights Commission, which will have the responsibility of monitoring the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report. Under the Liberian Constitution, the nominees must meet the consent of the Liberian Senate, and that process is currently under way. We have also established the Land Commission, and its Commissioners have been appointed to address the explosive issues of land disputes and the need for land reform. We note with satisfaction the achievement of the national disarmament, demobilization, rehabilitation and in conjunction with the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). That successfully concluded this year. However, high unemployment, especially among the youth, remains a major challenge. Liberia is pleased with the progress being made in the reconstitution of its armed forces, which includes the training of the 2,000-strong army with the assistance of our development partners, particularly the United States of America. We continue to encourage gender sensitivity in this important area of our national endeavours, considering that at present there are only 58 women in the new force. Improvements have also been registered in the performance of the reorganized Liberia National Police force, with the establishment of an emergency unit. The police, however, continue to face difficulties in achieving full operational capability in the areas of infrastructure, other requirements. Two weeks ago, successful partnership consultations were at United Nations Headquarters here in New York on the strategic plan programme was reintegration in July of programme, equipment, logistics carried held and out 24 in and Post-conflict to report significant justice. Concomitantly, We are pleased to make for the Liberia National Police. The responses of our partners, especially India, were encouraging. The objective of the strategic plan is to introduce an integrated programme that would ensure a consistent doctrine and training philosophy to enhance continuity. A similar strategic plan is also required for the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization to improve its efficiency and effectiveness in border control. that Liberia has continued strides the administration of justice and rule of law, in spite of daunting obstacles. We have established a special sexual and gender-based violent crimes court, which has begun hearing cases and encouraging victims to come forth and report on those crimes in the spirit of confidentiality the Government has further adopted several gender- sensitive policies and frameworks in pursuance of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). reconstruction and development require all Liberians to participate in the ongoing recovery and sustainable development efforts. The Government is therefore promoting and encouraging womens involvement at the leadership level and in all other spectrums of society, with emphasis on the education of the girl child. the International Colloquium on Womens Empowerment, Leadership Development, International Peace and Security, which was co-convened by the President of Liberia, Her Excellency Madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and the President of Finland, Her Excellency Madam Tarja Halonen, in Monrovia on 7 and 8 March 2009. At that event, the Monrovia Declaration was adopted, calling for action on resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security, and on climate change and gender. We want to thank all our partners and friends of the international community, including the institutions of the United Nations system and UNMIL, who contributed to the success of the programme. In that regard, we reaffirm that resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security recognizes that women, as civilians in conflict situations, are not only victims but also powerful agents for peace and the security for their communities. that Security Council resolution 1820 (2008) is an important component of resolution 1325 (2000) with regard to rape and sexual this connection, I wish We also recognize In to refer to to to that support violence against women and girls. Therefore, we recommend the Secretary-General appoint a special envoy on women, peace and security who would galvanize Member States implement resolution 1325 (2000) and ensure that the path towards its tenth anniversary is well prepared in a coherent manner. As a follow-up to the Monrovia extraordinary meeting, a side event to this sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly was jointly hosted yesterday by those two exemplary women leaders, here at United Nations Headquarters, to focus on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and climate change. In commending them for their excellent work, we join in their appeal to all Member States, Governments and non-governmental organizations the Monrovia Declaration. Liberia wishes to thank all the participants at that historic event for renewing their support of the Government of Liberia and for reform of the United Nations system, including the urgent need for gender equality in its organs and related agencies. Liberias economic revitalization is shaping up to become a post-conflict success story, due to the combination of the disciplined leadership and prudent policies of Her Excellency President Ellen Johnson- Sirleaf and the very constructive partnership with the international community. We remain cognizant of the fact that no amount of foreign assistance can transform a nation in the absence of sound moral leadership and technical competencies and of the commitment to improve the well-being of its citizens. It is out of this realization the Governments poverty reduction strategy and have cultivated a strategic partnership with friendly countries and organizations within the international community. The country experienced 7 per cent growth in 2008 and is expected to register 5 per cent this year, largely as a result of the negative impact of the global economic meltdown on demand for our major commodities and decreased capital inflows. National revenue collection rose by 25 per cent last year. We have improved our business and investment climate by establishing the “One Stop Shop” concept to spur private sector growth and create jobs. We have rehabilitated a total of 674 miles of primary and secondary roads to link communities that were isolated from the central administration as a result of the 14-year civil crisis. A robust and comprehensive that we formulated 25 is investment climate as well as civil service reform strategy has been instituted as a critical component of the public sector reform. Moreover, the President has promulgated a policy of mandatory free and compulsory primary education, with a special emphasis on girls, who are often victims of institutionalized bias and abuse. We have undertaken several economic reform initiatives and have set up the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission to create a transparent and predictable business and to encourage greater foreign direct investment. Liberia has also made noticeable progress towards reaching the targets for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. Qualifying under this process will open up the country to borrowing on the international financial markets and accepting loans. While Liberia has made and continues to make impressive progress towards consolidating peace, the gains remain fragile. In post-conflict situations such as ours, stability to development. Weak institutional capacity in the area of the rule of law, coupled with the absence of employment opportunities, especially for the youth, continue to threaten sustained progress. As we expect to hold general elections in 2011, successful conduct of these undertakings will set the nation firmly on the path of stability and democracy. It is therefore envisioned that continued, sustainable socio-economic development will serve as the catalyst for a smooth electoral process. The Mano River Union countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Cote dIvoire continue to host significant numbers of each others refugees in the subregion. For instance, more than 65,000 Liberian refugees are reportedly spread throughout West Africa, posing humanitarian challenges that require urgent action for cross-border movements. This is why we continue to urge the fast-tracking and relaxation of the stringent conditions for development assistance, if Liberia is to truly remain a model for post-conflict reconstruction and democracy. In this connection, Liberia requires the empathy and support of the international community for its young democracy as it improves the human rights situation, transparency, anti-corruption and good linked the the United Nations and governance, which are important priorities of the Government. In this vein, we wish to express the heartfelt gratitude of the Government and people of Liberia to the Security Council for extending the mandate of UNMIL for another year and further requesting it to provide a conducive security environment for the holding of general and presidential elections in 2011. The crucial nature of this democratic transition cannot be overemphasized as we commend the gallant men and women of UNMIL for their courageous and sacrificial services in keeping the peace. The issue of cross-border movement mentioned above demonstrates that the security and stability of the countries of the Mano River Union subregion are inextricably linked and that progress in one country cannot be divorced from progress in any one of the member States. Elections are soon to be held in Cote dIvoire and Guinea. As Chair of the Mano River Union and a member of the International Contact Group on Guinea, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf is urging international community to stay constructively engaged with Guinea while urging adherence to the original agreement so as to ensure a smooth transition to democratic rule in that country. Cross-border movements among the Mano River Union countries have become more complex and problematic due to the growing number of cases involving illicit drug trafficking, human trafficking and other organized transnational crime in the West African subregion and beyond. These problems necessitate the urgent need for collective international action to tackle these criminal activities, which are a menace to regional peace and security. Liberia supports the decision of the leaders of the Southern African Development Community on the lifting of United Nations sanctions against Zimbabwe. We are encouraged that the power-sharing agreement between the parties continues to hold as the country tries to recover. As regards Somalia, we note with regret the continuing deterioration of the situation in that country. In view of the unfortunate state of affairs there, Liberia calls for renewed commitment by the international community to provide logistical and financial support to the African Union peacekeeping initiatives to restore peace in that country. Liberia, as a beneficiary of 26 its into registers operations, strong the recent barbaric killings of peacekeeping condemnation of 17 African Union peacekeepers in Somalia. On Darfur, we are heartened by the expressed willingness of all the parties to end armed hostilities and to find a political solution to the problem that will ensure lasting peace for all people in that region. Liberia welcomes the just-ended Summit on Climate Change convened by the Secretary-General. We firmly believe that urgent action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to help all Member States, particularly developing countries, adequately respond to the harmful effects of this global phenomenon. Liberia continues to join in the call for a democratic Security Council that reflects the realities of the twenty-first century. The world today is far different from and more complex than that of the 1940s, when this Organization came into being. Liberia supports peacekeeping operations to put out the flames of war. However, we wish to underscore the benefits of establishing an early warning mechanism that will deal with potentially explosive situations before full blown conflagrations that present only ghastly choices. Additionally, it is important that the international community and dispensation to post-conflict countries to shield them from shocks in the worldwide system, such as the current global financial crisis. These upsets often have the effect of reversing the gains made in restoring peace to countries emerging from conflict. That is why Liberia welcomes the empathy and support of the international community in rebuilding its institutions destroyed by protracted civil conflict. The current global financial crisis is impregnated with the potential to undermine donor support to our national renewal agenda, thus threatening much needed foreign direct investment and delivery of social services. The result of the Governments inability to provide these basic services to its people has the propensity to provide fertile ground for acts of destabilization from internal and external sources. It is cheaper to prevent these risks than to have to mobilize already diminishing resources at much higher cost, sometimes lives and enormous resources, to react to them. involving human they escalate assistance provides special In conclusion, we pledge our unstinting support to your leadership and entertain the hope that together, we can advance the cause of humanity and make the world truly a better place to live.
