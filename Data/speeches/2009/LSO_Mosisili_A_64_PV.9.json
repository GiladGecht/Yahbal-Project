{"speech":{"0":" Mr. President, the theme that you have chosen for this session of the General Assembly — “Effective responses to global crises: strengthening multilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for international peace, security and development” — is both timely and relevant. We meet against the backdrop of some of the most serious challenges mankind has confronted in a long time. The financial and economic crisis, climate change and issues of international peace and security are but some of these challenges. No other organization is better placed than the United Nations to find solutions to them. June, your predecessor, Mr. President, the World convened a high-level Conference on Financial and Economic Crisis. We all had the opportunity then to identify and agree on the causes and effects of and solutions to this crisis. I shall not revisit the deliberations of that Conference. Suffice it to say that it seems obvious that Governments can no longer abdicate their responsibility of oversight and regulation of the global financial systems to financial institutions. The least developed and developing countries have been the hardest hit by the financial crisis. Their exports have been severely reduced and their capital flows choked. The impact of the crisis is felt in all aspects of life, be it in the increase in unemployment, illiteracy or the incidence of HIV- and AIDS-related In to complete deaths due to the unavailability or unaffordability of drugs. Lesotho, as a small economy, is highly vulnerable to external shocks and is therefore one of those adversely affected by the financial crisis. Demand for textile exports has dropped dramatically, resulting in unprecedented loss of livelihoods and erosion of the gains we had made in eradicating poverty. However, all is not lost. I note in this regard the efforts of the Group of Eight, which has pledged a stimulus package of $1.1 trillion, the major part of which will be made available to developing countries. My concern is that this initiative seems to have stalled and it is unclear how the funds will be distributed. It will be fair only if the disbursement is informed by the needs of individual countries, and I hasten to add that the disbursement should be free of quotas and conditions. While I remain optimistic that the pledge will see the light of day, I appeal for the fulfilment of commitments that have been made regarding overseas development aid. I further appeal for the requisite political will the Doha Round of negotiations as a matter of urgency. These negotiations are the anchor of our hope for the dawn of a fair and equitable international trade regime. on convening the just-ended Summit on Climate Change, at which we were unanimous in our belief that the challenges posed by climate change are beyond the capacity of any individual country to deal with alone. Response to the impact of climate change must be a top priority for the whole of mankind, for at stake here is the preservation of the very elements responsible for the sustenance of human life on our planet. the Copenhagen Conference will usher in a new global agreement that will result the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. We must never forget that at the forefront of those most affected by the impact of climate change are the poor and the innocent. Our call for the industrialized nations to help improve developing countries capacity for mitigation and adaptation is therefore not misplaced. Those who are responsible for causing pollution of the responsibility to make cuts in harmful emissions and to help those adversely affected. We acknowledge that climate change may not be our collective fault, but it is surely our collective responsibility. the environment have Secretary-General congratulate that Lesotho is hopeful I the in 29 the thereby Another challenge confronting us is that of international peace and security. This challenge is a matter of utmost interest to my delegation, for it reminds Governments of their obligation to protect their peoples from mass atrocities, including genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity. I am referring here to the principle of the responsibility to protect. The Rwanda genocide is still fresh in our minds. Though the wounds may have healed, the scars remain pronounced and serve as a painful reminder of mans inhumanity to man. They also serve as a sad reminder of how the international community can fail a people. Beyond Rwanda, and I dare say even post-Rwanda, we have witnessed mass atrocities committed with impunity against the most innocent and vulnerable populations. And sadly, the Security Council, in whose purview the power to act is centralized, has failed to act, incapacitating international communitys ability to act also. In our resolve never to fail any population again, we adopted the principle of the responsibility to protect at our 2005 World Summit. This principle seeks to restore the confidence of populations in the United Nations system. In July, the General Assembly held a debate on implementing the responsibility to protect (). Lesotho welcomes that balanced report, especially the proposed practical measures for its implementation. We view the report as a good basis for negotiations in the General Assembly on how to implement the principle. It is true that the scope of the principle is narrow and limited to genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. I would nonetheless discourage any reopening of the debates on paragraphs 138 and 139 of the World Summit Outcome Document (resolution ). I find a linkage between this principle and other critical feature on our international agenda. Among these are reform of the United Nations, especially the Security Council, disarmament and the International Criminal Court. Needless to say, the principle of the responsibility to protect is meaningful only if it is grounded in multilateralism the international community. The forums through which the responsibility to protect may be achievable is the Security Council and, beyond the General Assembly. Unfortunately, the Council, as presently the Secretary-Generals that continue collective action report issues that, and on to by the Council the United Nations. intents and purposes, composed, is not capable of exercising effective leadership in this area. The Security Council reflects the situation that obtained 64 years ago. It is not a true reflection of the current membership of Its composition is therefore irrelevant and undemocratic. For all lacks legitimacy. For as long as it remains undemocratic, it will continue to fail the vulnerable and defenceless. It will continue to use double standards and remain a tool of the foreign policies of certain States. The desired multilateral path will continue to give way to the unilateral one. It is imperative, therefore, to hasten the United Nations reform process. The intergovernmental negotiations that were held during the sixty-third session of the General Assembly have advanced the reform process a step or two. However, more still needs to be done and rather urgently. The United Nations was formed on the ashes of the two World Wars. Its main purpose was and still is to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold misery to mankind. But the continuing possession and development of nuclear weapons cast doubt on whether this objective can indeed be realized. At a time when the world is hungering for nuclear disarmament, why should some countries be testing, modernizing and producing new generations of nuclear weapons? international community to strive for a world free of nuclear weapons. We remain disappointed in those countries that are engaged in the testing of nuclear weapons. We must, however, reiterate the right of every country to the development and use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. The peaceful use of nuclear technology can be beneficial to all mankind. We are delighted that the third session of the Preparatory Committee the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons has adopted the agenda for the 2010 Review Conference. This historic achievement strengthens our optimism that our commitment to the disarmament process will gain renewed momentum and enthusiasm. In 1998, the Statute establishing the International Criminal Court was adopted in Rome. The Court is, inter alia, an answer to war crimes and crimes against the humanity. It safeguards is our obligation as the rule of law the for in It 30 that We also hope decolonization and sovereignty of nations. Both the General Assembly and the Security Council have recognized the inalienable rights of the Saharan people to self-determination and independence. We urge the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic and the Kingdom of Morocco to continue with their negotiations on an equal footing and without any conditions. The aspirations of the Saharan people to self-determination must take paramount priority in these negotiations. the positive signals of engagement between the Republic of Cuba and the United States of America will bring an end to the unfortunate financial and economic embargo imposed on the Republic of Cuba. Lesotho shall continue to support the call for the lifting of the economic embargo against the people of Cuba as a matter of principle and of urgency. I wish to conclude by saying that no obstacle can beat the might of the United Nations. We must continue to pursue and indeed to cherish the purposes that have brought us together. The responsibility to secure the future of mankind relies heavily on our ability to use a collective approach to resolving the challenges of the world. We cannot ignore our responsibility to build a better and more united world, future generations. the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and Minister for Defence and Public Service of the Kingdom of Lesotho for the statement he has just made. The Right Honourable Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, Prime Minister and Minister for Defence and Public Service of the Kingdom of Lesotho, was escorted from the rostrum. "}}
