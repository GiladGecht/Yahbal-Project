{"speech":{"0":" At to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. We wish him success in his work and assure him of Montenegros unwavering support. I would also like to thank the former President, Miguel dEscoto Brockmann, for his endeavours and personal contribution in discharging this challenging post. At the same time I would like to pay my tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his outstanding efforts in leading the Organization in these trying times. As we have heard from the statements of previous distinguished speakers, given the impact of the world economic and financial crisis and related food and energy crises, climate change and the flu pandemic on the economic and social growth and development, politics and global relations, including achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other internationally agreed development goals, only a coordinated and a concerted global effort can yield positive results. requires, Response therefore, that we pool all capacities and resources, as well as a strong political will from us all. In this, the key role belongs to the United Nations, the worlds most important multilateral forum. Montenegro, as a country that advocates the equality of peoples and nations international relations, is fully committed to active participation in efforts to work out a global response to present-day challenges. Preserving peace and security through activities creating positive political, economic, social and cultural environments for the implementation and respect of international law, the rule of law and the protection and promotion of fundamental human rights and freedoms are the main principles and bases of the Montenegrin foreign policy priorities. In that regard, Montenegro remains strongly committed to the fundamental principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter, which imply peaceful resolution of disputes and non-interference in the internal affairs of States. challenges current aimed to in at 33 are financial markets Strong cooperation with neighbouring countries and regional stability are the underlying principles of the foreign policy of Montenegro and a precondition for progress in its broader integration processes. Since the previous General Assembly session, we have moved to a new and more demanding phase of European and Euro-Atlantic integration. We feel the dynamic progress particularly encouraged by Montenegro has made towards membership in the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). We expect that in the near future the European Commission will issue an opinion on Montenegros preparedness for EU membership, and we also expect an invitation to join in the NATO Membership Action Plan, which will open additional opportunities for those two integration processes to gain momentum. Taking into consideration the strong impact of the world economic and financial crisis on overall socio- economic development, the most recent reports from the global encouraging, indicating an end to the global crisis even earlier than to ensure sustained expected. However, economic and implementation the achievement of international solidarity is imperative in addressing the needs of the worlds poorest and most vulnerable. Given that the recovery is going to be long and gradual, all countries, led by the United Nations, should be committed to the implementation of policies and measures initiated in the various international forums, including the United Nations Conference on the world economic and financial crisis and its impact on development, the G-20, World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Bearing in mind the nature of the Montenegrin economy as a small and open system, we have not been able turbulent global developments. In that regard, the Government of Montenegro has adopted a package of economic policy measures aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability, improving productivity and preserving a favourable economic environment. The harmful consequences of climate change, increasing growing dependence on imported fossil fuels, along with their negative impacts on the environment and standards of development, trade increased agreements consumption to remain aid and in order immune energy and the of to a for call change living, are issues causing profound concern among us all. The Summit on Climate Change held on the eve of the general debate is, in our view, a significant step forward in Member States political support for the process of the implementation of the MDGs in this field. We believe that both the character and the effects of climate comprehensive international response based on the principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which would facilitate sustainable economic development of society in accordance with the guidelines of the 2007 Bali Action Plan. I would like to take this opportunity to express Montenegros strong support for the negotiation process on a new post-2012 climate framework and for calls to “seal the deal” in Copenhagen in December. We believe that further efforts need to be made to promote a green recovery and to build up national capacities for adaptation and mitigation of the impact of climate change, while simultaneously stimulating innovation and economic growth, contributing to poverty reduction and ensuring access to sustainable energy sources. In that regard, we underline the importance of regional cooperation, which enables us to implement adaptation and mitigation measures in a regional context, which promotes political dialogue and leads to more effective action by States in the talks within the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol frameworks. the efforts being undertaken at the national and international levels in addressing the impact of climate change on the environment and economic development and in reaching a successful deal in Copenhagen, Montenegro will organize a regional conference on climate change and sustainable development for the Mediterranean and South-East European countries in Budva, on 16 and 17 October. The Millennium Development Goals require each and every one of us to redouble our efforts to reduce poverty, improve health and education, promote peace and sustainable development. We are aware that it is the primary responsibility of States to take measures aimed at improving the poor and vulnerable segments of society and alleviating the most the social security of to contribute In order achieve human rights, and to 34 aimed including the MDGs, documents — severe consequences of poverty. In this context we strongly welcome the convening of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) review summit in 2010. Montenegro strongly supports and is committed to fulfilment of the MDGs and implementation of all United Nations the Millennium Declaration — related to development issues and the special needs of Africa, as a pre-emptive action aimed at creating a safer world. As a country moving towards European integration, we welcome the European Union-Africa partnership and the efforts currently under way to find solutions to development needs and to root out poverty on the African continent. In this regard, we support the message of the 2008 Yokohama Declaration at giving momentum to current development issues, including education, health and sanitary measures within the framework of the development of agriculture to improve food security, measures to tackle climate change, as well as establishing and maintaining peace as a prerequisite for economic growth. We emphasize the crucial importance of the debate on the concept of the responsibility to protect, and we fully support the activities of the Secretary- General and the assessments outlined in his latest report. We believe that an upsurge of internal conflicts and serious violations of human rights in the 1990s has spurred a discussion on the need for the protection of civilians in armed conflict, which has unquestionably led to further deliberations on and analyses of the primary obligation of each State to protect its citizens from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, as well as to consideration of the international communitys responsibility in the event that countries fail to act. In this context, we underline the importance of reaching an agreement on an appropriate concept and instruments within the framework of the United Nations and international law, based on a broad consensus of all actors. In supporting peacekeeping missions as efficient and dynamic instruments for monitoring respect of human rights and building sustainable institutions in conflict areas, we have established legal prerequisites within our security policy in order to be able to contribute our military and police troops to the United Nations peacekeeping missions, including missions to (IDPs) and and the need for the importance of Given the problems of the Organization Montenegro stresses internally displaced persons the United Nations High Commissioner Liberia, Afghanistan and Cyprus and the European Union peace operation in Somalia. the Balkan region, Montenegro attaches particular importance to a policy that addresses the needs of refugees, asylum-seekers and is conducting extensive activities aimed at finding lasting solutions for the refugees and IDPs from the territory of the former Yugoslavia. As part of those efforts, a renewed registration procedure supported by the Office of for Refugees (UNHCR) is under way for refugees and IDPs living in Montenegro to resolve their final status, in accordance with the highest international standards and international law instruments. In this regard we highlight the importance of a comprehensive approach and the cooperation of all actors, primarily UNHCR, the European Commission and for Security and Cooperation in Europe. the promotion of and the respect for international law in the development of international relations today. In this context, the rule of law and the protection of human rights have an irreplaceable role in the fight against international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and organized crime. the coordinated efforts of the global community can take on international terrorism. Montenegro supports the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter- Terrorism Strategy, as well as measures to fight corruption, organized crime, drug trafficking and human trafficking, and we further underscore the need for cooperation among all the bodies of the United Nations system, in particular the committees of the Security Council the Counter-Terrorism Committee. Montenegro attaches particular importance to the fulfilment of the obligations stipulated by the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and it actively participates in projects of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which contribute to regional peace and stability, strengthening of the judiciary and a more efficient fight against all forms of organized crime. firmly convinced We are that only 35 that decision In our view, In view of all of the above, it is clear that the responsibility of the United Nations is only increasing. We therefore welcome the reform process of the world Organization and hope that it will result in a more democratic and representative United Nations. We attach particular importance to strengthening the role and efficiency of the General Assembly and its main bodies, and fully support intergovernmental talks on Security Council reform. These negotiations offer an opportunity for small States to express their interests, in addition to providing a vision for an improved and more transparent functioning of the most important United Nations organ. As the Assembly may know, this past June the United Nations Development Group identified Montenegro as a country eligible for implementation of the Delivering as One pilot initiative launched within the framework of the overall reform process aimed at improving the efficiency, coherence and coordination of United Nations development programmes on the ground. recognizes Montenegros strong commitment to United Nations standards and values and provides an endorsement of the highly successful joint efforts of the United Nations team and the Montenegrin Government. Given the myriad of challenges and their negative effects on the environment, as well as the potential increase in social, religious and cultural tensions leading to political instability, only the coordinated and comprehensive international stakeholders, including civil society and the private sector, can create the preconditions for efficiently addressing the consequences of the ongoing crises. In this regard, the United Nations has a decisive role to play in coordinating efforts towards the achievement of concrete results. Convinced of the great potential of the United Nations, if supported by the active participation of Member States, we reiterate Montenegros commitment to building a responsible international community ready to meet the needs of all of its members.
