{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of my delegation I congratulate Mr. Ali Treki on his election as President of the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I am sure that his wisdom and experience will guide us as we address the challenges on the global agenda. I would like to pay tribute to the important work of your predecessor Mr. Miguel dEscoto Brockmann. He led the Assemblys sixty- third through complex discussions and extensive investigations in a spirit of responsibility and good faith. I also take this opportunity to commend the Secretary-General and his staff for their continued dedication the ongoing efforts for improving the working methods of the Organization and its interaction with Member States. The world continues to face many challenges, both traditional and new. Whilst traditional challenges to international peace and security persist, we also have to cope with non-traditional threats such as pervasive increased intensity of natural disasters and frequency and environmental degradation. Added to those challenges in overseeing diseases, poverty, session deadly the understanding the realization of are the energy, food, financial and economic crises, all of which are hampering the Millennium Development Goals by the target date of 2015. Our growing interdependence in todays world only strengthens that current challenges transcend national borders and therefore require concerted action and responses from the international community. The United Nations therefore remains the central forum for addressing global issues, and we continue to advocate effective multilateralism not as an option but as a necessity. In this regard we deem it indispensable for the United Nations to continue its reform efforts. This should include meaningful reform of the Security Council, to make it more effective and responsive to todays challenging world. Of equal importance is strengthened cooperation within and between regional groups. We should continue to promote and pursue intensified channels of political dialogue between regional groups in reaffirming our shared commitment to multilateralism. In this spirit, my country participates in regional and interregional endeavours to strengthen political, economic, cultural and social cooperation and integration. I would like to highlight the importance of the United Nations as an effective agent in advancing multilateralism and emphasize the need for it to strengthen its role of consultation and coordination with regional organizations. The urgency of the threat posed by climate change requires the same degree of multilateral engagement as has been demonstrated in areas ranging from the fight against the uncontrolled spread of illicit small arms and light weapons, the fight against international to control HIAIDS, on the one hand, and peacekeeping and peacebuilding, the advancement of women and the protection of human rights, on the other. We express our appreciation to the Secretary- General for convening the recent Summit on Climate Change to garner the necessary political support to “seal the deal” in Copenhagen. Suriname expects an agreement in Copenhagen with ambitious mitigation and adaptation targets. We expect the commitments necessary to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in appropriate quantities and to support adaptation in developing countries. Countries that are historically terrorism and the effort 22 the look forward responsible for the current emissions of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere should take the lead in this area. Mr. Shaheed (Maldives), Vice-President, took the Chair. In forest carbon-mitigation the spirit of common but differentiated to appropriate responsibilities, we mitigation efforts by developing countries. As a high- forest low-deforestation (HFLD) country, Suriname will continue with its efforts to manage its forests sustainably. In this way we aim to keep and improve the climate-stabilizing capacity of our standing forests. We attach great importance to the establishment of a future regime providing positive incentives to HFLD countries. In this regard we call your attention to the report of the Informal Working Group on Interim Finance for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD). This report estimates that, if financing of €15 billion to €25 billion is available for the 2010- 2015 period, a 25 per cent reduction in annual global deforestation rates will be achievable by 2015. In this regard we call upon institutions and fellow Member States to support United Nations REDD+ efforts in recognition of the beneficial potential of tropical forests in mitigating climate change. Suriname has emphasized its support for the promotion of dialogue among civilizations and the culture of peace in various international forums, especially through the full implementation of the Global Agenda and Programme of Action for Dialogue among Civilizations, as well as the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace (resolutions and , respectively). Our democracy serves as an illustration of our quest for peace, security and development. Various ethnic groups with different multicultural backgrounds and religious traditions have come a long way in coexisting and cooperating in a harmonious and peaceful way. This engagement is reflected in the political representation of our administration. It is within this atmosphere of democratic values, of high levels of religious and ethnic tolerance, that we are building a society that can prosper and engage with the region and the world beyond. In order to achieve international peace, and development, cooperation should be based upon constructive and respectful dialogue. This dialogue should be guided by security advances. technological a spirit of tolerance, acceptance and trust among religions, peoples and cultures. Only with mutual trust and understanding will we be able to overcome international tensions. The Secretary-General recently emphasized the importance of education for development. Education has always been foundation of economic opportunity and prosperity. Knowledge and advanced skills are critical tools for enhancing every countrys economic potential, growth and standard of living. This is why we have to join our efforts to improve the capacity of countries to adopt, disseminate and maximize Improved international cooperation aimed at creating better educational systems will help developing countries progress faster towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, particularly those related to all levels of education, health and gender equality. The promotion and protection of human rights are among the most effective strategies for eliminating inequalities between social groups and within and between countries, and Suriname therefore remains committed to the promotion and protection of all human rights. the supreme of international namely, aggression — Suriname expresses that a decision on the elements of crime will be taken very soon. The upcoming Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, to be held in Uganda next year, should therefore address this issue seriously. For more than 60 years the United Nations has been able to build confidence and understanding between Member States and help keep global peace. to My development, and international peace and security. We will continue to engage in constructive dialogue aimed at contributing to a better future for all. "}}
