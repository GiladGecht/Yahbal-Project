{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of President James Michel of Seychelles, leader of one of the smallest nations of this Assembly, I congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. the entire organizational system and interdependent 32 As In Seychelles, our into a Standby Arrangement with With a population of just over 85,000, we are painfully aware of our vulnerability as a nation at the mercy of the ebb and flow of global tides. Our vulnerability is all the more acute in this age marked by economic and other crises and the increasingly destructive effects of climate change. However, precisely because of that, our citizens are aware of our responsibility as a nation within the community of nations. We are aware that the solutions to our problems do not lie solely within our borders. an assembly of nations, we must take into account more than ever the responsibility that we have and that we share. That is our responsibility to our peoples and to humanity as a whole. The international community has not shirked that responsibility in the face of the world financial crisis, for example, as every nation has had to react in one way or inherent vulnerabilities and economic imbalances, which had accumulated over time, meant that we had to act earlier than many other States to face up to the crisis. We entered the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and are also discussing debt rescheduling through the Paris Club. for every Seychellois, but we are seeing the results, and our nation is emerging stronger and more resilient. We still have a long way to go, but we, and our multilateral and bilateral partners, have all been surprised at how quickly we have emerged and managed to improve our economic situation. The process has also marked a milestone in the relationship between multilateral financial institutions and a small island developing State. It has proved to us that, although the voices of the smaller States are often drowned in the tumult of the international arena, the instruments of the global economy can be adapted to meet the needs of a smaller partner. Our specificities and vulnerabilities have been the discussions with our recognized multilateral and bilateral partners. Seychelles would like to salute the role played by the IMF, the World Bank and the African Development Bank in that process. We would also like to express our appreciation to our bilateral partners and other organizations that have supported us in one way or another in facing up to the crisis. It is an example of a responsibility shared. Through shared responsibility, a crisis can be The process has been difficult another. throughout shared responsibility, what contained. Through appeared to be impossible has become achievable. It is our duty in this Assembly to use the principle of shared responsibility in solving our global problems, especially in offering solidarity and assistance to those States in need of outside support. We have all heard how the unrest in Somalia has spilled beyond its borders to manifest itself as piracy on the high seas. Seychelles is one of the States directly affected and heavily impacted by that scourge, as pirates prey on shipping and lay siege to the yachting, tourism and fishing industries of the Western Indian Ocean. The long-term effects are much broader: as insurance premiums for shipping increase, the cost of transporting essential goods rises correspondingly. Also, we have often seen that economic desperation, coupled with long-term political instability, can lead to a breeding ground for terrorism. Seychelles is pleased to note the increasing engagement of many States in the fight against piracy in the Indian Ocean. We share the responsibility to ensure peace and stability in the region; as always, this is the prerequisite for progress. We must take action in three areas to effectively tackle the piracy situation. The root cause of the problem lies within Somalia. The long-term solution lies in establishing peace, stability, progress and the rule of law within Somalia. Through enhanced coordination and the sharing of information, we must ensure that piracy is not economically viable. We must share information to ensure that, by keeping vessels beyond their reach, we are always ahead of the pirates. We must ensure that there is enough deterrence in terms of military assets in the region. Seychelles alone has an exclusive economic zone of 1.4 million square kilometres to patrol and protect, which we would not be able to do effectively without the help of friendly countries. is our shared responsibility more needed than in protecting and nurturing our shared environment. For the small island developing States (SIDS), the preservation of our environment is about our safety, our security, our economy and, ultimately, our survival. Thus, the battle against climate change is for a battle for our survival. Small island States and other particularly vulnerable nations, such as the least developed countries, cannot look at that issue in any other way. Nowhere 33 previous global disasters, is not occurring in one sudden instant, but rather is gaining in pace and destructive power over time. It is also a disaster which is man-made, which is to say that it is our fault. As such, it is a disaster that we have a duty and a responsibility to prevent and that we can prevent. We cannot afford to leave any nation behind in Copenhagen, no matter how poor, how weak or how small. Once again, this is our shared responsibility that we must assume. "}}
