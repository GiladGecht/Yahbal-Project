{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, allow me to convey the warm greetings of the Head of State, Government and people of Togo on the occasion of the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I also wish to add that the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Togo, who unfortunately is absent from New York, asked me to read out the following statement : The fight against climate change is a fight based on our undeniable human right to exist not only as nation States, but as peoples and communities. For example, the Arctic peoples and other indigenous peoples are also suffering from climate change first hand. Their voices, just like those of us in the SIDS and other particularly vulnerable States, need to be heard by the world s leaders. Nothing is more critical to our survival as States, as nations, as peoples and as communities than an urgent, coherent and effective response to the effects of climate change. But the response thus far has been sorely lacking. Weeks before Copenhagen, we are still unsure as to what type of an agreement we will get there. Furthermore, there are indications that if an agreement is made, it will not suffice to save many island States. As the last small island developing State to speak in this general debate, Seychelles therefore feels it has a duty to remind the international community that in the coming weeks before Copenhagen, the Alliance of Small Island States will continue to steadfastly call for that which is necessary to our survival. That includes stabilizing long-term atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at well below 350 parts per million; ensuring temperature increases be limited to well below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels; and requiring global greenhouse gas emissions to peak by 2015 and decline significantly thereafter. Furthermore, greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by more than 85 per cent by 2050. Annex 1 greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by at least 45 per cent by 2020 and by 2050, at least 95 per cent of 1990 carbon dioxide levels should be reduced. Non-Annex 1 emissions should also demonstrate significant deviations from baseline over comparable time periods. Before concluding, Seychelles must salute the United Nations for the body of work it has contributed to advancing our understanding of how climate change is damaging our planet. Seychelles also thanks Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership in ensuring that climate change, and especially the plight of the particularly vulnerable such as the small island developing States, get the attention they deserve. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has shown us that climate change is a disaster very much in the making. It is a disaster which, unlike that average global surface to convey to you, Sir, “From this rostrum, where the leaders of the entire planet have expressed their views on the major questions of the time, I should in turn like to share with this Assembly the following ideas, prompted by the developments in our world over the past 12 months. “Before performing this duty, however, I wish the warm congratulations of the Government and the people of Togo on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. I can assure you of my delegations willingness to work with you to carry out your mandate, the success of which will do honour to Africa and in particular to your country, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, with which Togo maintains friendly relations of solidarity and cooperation. “Also I wish to convey to your predecessor, Father Miguel dEscoto Brockmann, my congratulations on his work and in particular for the commendable initiatives he undertook throughout his mandate to restore the General Assembly to its due place and role under the United Nations Charter. To His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, I convey our 34 in solidarity international congratulations for the dynamic and pragmatic manner with which he has guided our Organization. “I hereby forcefully reaffirm Togos full adherence to the ideals of peace, security and development that are at the centre of the priorities of our Organization. My country also endorses the approaches adopted by our Organization in recent years to further sustainable development by promoting peace and security and by mobilizing the economic, social and cultural arenas. “Political, administrative and economic governance remains essential to the consolidation of peace and security in our countries and undoubtedly helps to speed up achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. However, no harmonious and lasting development is possible without a climate of peace and national concord. That is why the Government of Togo spares no effort to create conditions conducive to bold reforms and to lay the foundations for a new republican pact and national reconciliation. Indeed, since 2005, the Government, under the guidance of the Head of State, has worked tirelessly for a policy of openness, the promotion of democracy, the strengthening of the rule of law and the reduction of poverty. A number of reforms have been undertaken in this regard, especially constitutional, institutional and socio-economic areas. “Politically, the Head of State has engaged in dialogue as an instrument of political consensus. This approach, based on a politics of complete openness, culminated in the signing in August 2006 of the Global Political Accord, which the formation of a Government of national unity, facilitated by His Excellency Blaise Compaore, President of Burkina Faso. I recall that the implementation of the Global Political Accord and the 22 commitments undertaken with the European Union led to the holding of free and democratic legislative elections in October 2007, which were welcomed unanimously by international community. In the same spirit, a Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission has been set up, the members of which were appointed on 29 May 2009. Its purpose is to shed light on the political the political, turn led the in in to “With regard relaxing to constitutional acts of violence that occurred in Togo between 1958 and 2005 in order once and for all to banish impunity from our country and to reconcile the people of Togo with their history. reform, significant progress has been made. In August, the National Assembly adopted a law modifying the electoral code, the eligibility conditions for presidential elections, and allowing for the establishment of a national independent electoral commission and its reconfiguration in order to adapt it to current political realities. At the same time, discussions of certain questions continue with the firm resolve of the Government to carry out the rest of the reforms on the basis of consensus, since we have made concerted action and dialogue the foundation of our political action in Togo. “In the institutional area, we have striven to reconstitute the Constitutional Court, the National Human Rights Commission and the High Authority for Audiovisual and Communication. Similarly, the Government of Togo has established a court of audits and adopted statutes for the opposition. It has also made arrangements for the public financing of political parties and the organs of the private press. judiciary, our vast the modernization programme of the judicial system continues in a satisfactory manner, with a view to involving the administration of justice. In this regard, the Government has taken measures to guarantee citizens freedom of expression, for example, by decriminalizing press offences. Furthermore, to demonstrate its desire to respect human dignity rights, our Government and defend human submitted the National Assembly a bill abolishing the death penalty. This law, adopted unanimously on 24 June, is the outcome of a constitutional provision that requires the State to guarantee the physical and mental integrity, life and security of all persons living on our national territory. “The efforts undertaken by the Government in the areas of health, education and employment, particularly for young people, have also seen the people more closely the security forces and “As concerns the army, to in 35 it a genuine instrument for cooperation. This the past 15 years due the financial constraints afflicting to considerable progress. In the field of health, we have established a national health development plan for the years 2009 to 2013, at a cost of 317 billion CFA francs, reflecting the will of the Togolese Government to respond effectively to our peoples health needs. With regard to education, Togos educational system has suffered from the the country for suspension of situation, compounded by a high demand for education, has resulted in a decline in teaching conditions and serious structural problems. In the face of these constraints, the Government has committed to establish a sectoral education plan that will allow the country to launch a fast-track initiative in 2010 to ensure education for all. “To put a new face on public administration and make the reconstruction and modernization of our country, we have undertaken broad reforms that require, inter alia, the recruitment of new officials. Thus, thousands of young people have found work in the public and private sectors thanks to the creation of better production conditions for the economic and social development of the country. the economic sector, appropriate measures have been taken to put public finances on a sound footing, create a favourable framework for business and attract investment, particularly from abroad. In this context, I take this opportunity to once again make an urgent appeal to all our bilateral and multilateral partners, particularly the European Union and the Bretton Woods institutions, to help in Togo towards socio-economic recovery. the “In development and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to international peace and security, and thus a reason for us to give these questions the highest priority. In this regard, my country welcomed the Security Council summit held on 24 September, under the presidency of the United States, on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. While we reaffirm that multilateralism is the fundamental principle of disarmament and non-proliferation, Togo hopes the opinion of my delegation, consideration a growing its efforts governing represent threat “With regard to 36 our times. In in modern this regard, the Assembly commit that the Security Council summit will lead to a new approach to this crucial question. With regard to light arms, Togo reiterates its desire to see the current session of to strengthening the implementation of the project aimed at negotiating a treaty on the traffic in light arms, as has been done by the Economic Community of West African States in this area. “Concerning terrorism, an obstacle to peace and lasting development, my country feels that it has become imperative to improve and globalize the international legal framework in order to combat this scourge, which has assumed a new form the completion within a reasonable time frame of negotiations on a draft comprehensive convention against international terrorism would be salutary and in the interests of all. “Similarly, the phenomenon of drugs, and in particular the illicit traffic in drugs along the west coast of Africa, has become a true danger and a destabilizing factor for the region. In light of the scale of this scourge, it is beyond a shadow of a doubt that no country can combat or hope to put an end to it alone. Togo therefore appeals for international cooperation, and in particular for the wealthy countries and assistance competent organizations, this phenomenon and thereby restoring the climate of security so essential to development. For its part, in spite of its scarce resources, Togo has undertaken a relentless struggle against drug traffickers and is cooperating with its neighbours in order to contain the scourge. “As we all know, international peace and security continue the stability of certain countries disturbed by conflicts, terrorism and underdevelopment, all of which are largely man-made. Indeed, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Chad, the Central African Republic and Darfur, where crises continue, our Organization should continue to engage in a search for solutions that will allow those countries to recover the peace and security necessary to their development. initiatives despite undertaken in April 2009 by the international community and by the African Union in July threatened and in eradicating “In Somalia, to be from the 2009 in support of security institutions and the African Union Mission in Somalia, the situation remains precarious and disturbing. That is why my country urgently appeals for other urgent measures to be taken to prevent that country from succumbing to chaos for good. “Regarding Cote dIvoire, we note with satisfaction the positive evolution of the political situation in that country since the Ouagadougou Political Agreement. Consequently, we call on the stakeholders to display the political will to organize the presidential election. “With regard to Guinea, it would seem appropriate and timely to encourage the political class to find, through dialogue and consultation, ways and means of ensuring a rapid return to constitutional order. “As to the situation in the Niger, where the revision of the Constitution has provoked a crisis, my country hopes that the parties concerned in the Niger will strive to restore dialogue and consensus in order to maintain a climate of peace and harmony in that sister country. the Middle East, a theatre of violence and desolation, an equitable and final settlement of the conflicts between the countries of this region should be found as soon as possible. To that end, the international community should encourage the various actors to find a peaceful solution to their conflicts. In this regard, my delegation reaffirms that the solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires the creation of a Palestinian State living side by side with the State of Israel within secure and internationally recognized borders. the continuing acts of terrorism that have afflicted the peoples of Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan and undermined the efforts of these countries to promote development. That is why we urge the international community to increase its assistance to the Governments of those countries in their fight against terrorism in order to promote peace and reconstruction. “After two decades of economic stagnation resulting from policies of budgetary austerity imposed on developing countries, the latter are “Furthermore, my country deplores in “Outside the African continent, now facing new challenges from the food, financial, energy and environmental crises. In the light of this situation, it is imperative to work to mitigate the financial shock and to pursue bold policies to increase the agricultural and energy production capacities of the developing countries. At the same time, we need to consider overall structural reform of the world economic and financial system in order to prevent a resurgence of such crises. “My country therefore welcomed the high- level Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development, held from 24 to 26 June, which illustrated the need for international solidarity in the face of the crisis in order to ease the suffering of the peoples of developing countries. “In that context, Togo welcomes the early implementation, in April 2009, of one of the pledges made at the G-20 meeting in London, concerning the establishment of the Global Trade Liquidity Programme amounting to $50 billion from 2009 to 2011, $15 billion of which are allocated to the African continent. Similarly, my country welcomes the initiative taken in March 2009 by the African Development Bank to create a special $500 million funding mechanism for African trade. “Furthermore, my delegation is pleased that the United Nations, at the initiative of the Secretary-General, has taken the measure of the danger posed to humanity by the problem of climate change and the environment. the high-level this meeting that took place a few days ago in this very body was an opportunity to analyse the situation and to clear the way for the Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December. To paraphrase a great man, we have inherited the Earth and we should not destroy it. Living creatures come and go, but the Earth remains. “In the face of the questions that my delegation has just raised, it is imperative to intensify partnerships of all kinds if we wish to prevent a situation in which, 64 years after its creation, our shared Organization should find itself still facing the same challenges. It is to be hoped, therefore, that Member States, in whose the degradation of regard, In 37 interest it is that the United Nations should be more democratic, strong and effective, should determine to give it the resources necessary to permit it to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and thereby to meet the challenges that our world faces today.” "}}
