{"speech":{"0":" This session is being held at a time of unprecedented efforts made by States and international institutions to overcome the global financial and economic crisis. Unfortunately, the present state of regional and national anti-crisis programmes and the huge cost of their implementation do not yet guarantee the stabilization of the world financial market, growth of demand and the revival of economic activity in the industrial sphere. In our opinion, effectively overcoming the global crisis and mitigating its consequences largely depend on the effectiveness and coordination of measures taken within individual States and by the world community as a whole — as well as, in particular, on the development of new rules to regulate financial markets that meet modern requirements, and on ensuring stricter control over the efficient use of enormous State and corporate financial assets by transnational and national banking institutions in order to avoid a new wave of inflation and economic bubbles and a collapse in the commodities and stock markets. I would like to say a few words about the measures to mitigate and neutralize the impact of the world financial and economic crisis. Our own model of transition from a centralized plan and ideological system to a free market, which is based on five well-known principles, has played a key role in those measures and in ensuring stability during the 1990s as well as the balanced development of Uzbekistans economy. Another element of success is our 2009-2012 anti-crisis programme, which is being carried out at this time. Thanks to the measures taken, macroeconomic stability, steady annual rates of economic growth averaging 8 to 9 per cent, low rates of inflation, the wide-scale attraction of foreign investments and an in Uzbekistan taken increase in the real level of income of the population have been ensured in the country in recent years. For the first half of 2009 and continuing throughout, gross domestic product growth amounted to 8.2 per cent. From this high rostrum, I would like to speak briefly about problems related to the growing threats to environmental security. Those include not only the threats arising from global warming, but also the serious problems of possible technological accidents and risks posed by gigantic hydropower installations in the region, which could seriously undermine the fragile ecological balance of Central Asia. We speak of these problems while keeping in mind the human-caused accidents at the worlds largest hydropower stations and hydraulic installations caused by their inadequate design and operation — for example, the accident at the Sayano-Shushenskaya hydropower station in Russia. We who live in Central Asia are seriously concerned about similar large hydro- installations operating today in watersheds of the largest transboundary rivers — the Amu-Darya and the Syr-Darya — and providing water to the populations of all of the countries of the region. The active manipulation of public opinion and attempts to attract wide-scale investments to build the two newest and largest hydropower stations — Rogun on the Syr-Darya river — are occurring today without taking into account the fact that the glaciers on the Pamir and Tian Shan mountains, which are the basic sources of water for these rivers, are shrinking every year. In addition, and of particular importance — even without considering tragic consequences of potential technological accidents at these installations — is the knowledge that these territories have seismic ratings ranging from 9 to 10 on the Richter scale and are more prone to strong earthquakes. In this regard, Uzbekistan will continue to insist that all planned construction of large hydropower installations in Central Asia be implemented only after impartial evaluation by international experts under the auspices of the United Nations in order to avoid possible catastrophic consequences. There is also an urgent need large hydropower stations on the Amu-Darya and Syr-Darya rivers that were constructed in the Soviet period. The war in Afghanistan, where tensions are currently growing, is one of the main sources of the Amu-Darya river and Kambarata on the existing the possible to re-evaluate 9 to to resolve involved today and the world community concern in particular of security threats in Central Asia. This problem and ways it are, without exaggeration, the focus of attention of the worlds largest Powers and the international community today. It is no longer a secret that the Afghan problem, which began 30 years ago, has no military solution. The overwhelming majority of countries in settling the conflict agree on this. It is impossible to improve and radically change the situation in the country without solving such urgent issues as the reconstruction of Afghanistans economy, communications and social infrastructure destroyed by war; without involving the Afghan people in this process; without a thoroughly considered and seriously organized negotiation process and the achievement of consensus between the conflicting parties; and without strengthening the vertical power structure. It is extremely important to pay full respect to the deep historical and ethno-demographic roots of the multinational people of Afghanistan, including the traditional values of Islam and of all confessions, which should be the main condition and guarantee of the negotiating process. The settlement of the Afghan problem could be facilitated by the creation of the six plus three contact group under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation of the plenipotentiary representatives of the States neighbouring Afghanistan plus Russia, the United States and NATO. The President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, has repeatedly emphasized that the implementation of this initiative involving neighbouring countries would allow the achievement of an accord both in and around Afghanistan. interdependence of regional and global problems necessitates close cooperation between the United Nations and such regional structures as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. In its capacity as the current Chair of the Shanghai Cooperation intensify Organization, Uzbekistan interaction between the Shanghai Cooperation Organization by turning the cooperation into a real partnership. In the absence of the President, Mr. Christian (Ghana), Vice-President, took the Chair. the United Nations and intends The to like I would In conclusion, the United Nations and In our opinion, interaction between the United Nations and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization should develop in such priority areas as security and stability and economic, social and humanitarian development, as well as other spheres of mutual interest. We believe that the effective combination of the United Nations great experience and the Shanghai Cooperation Organizations potential will strengthen regional and international security and promote sustainable development in the countries of the region. In this regard, we call upon Members of the United Nations to support a draft resolution on cooperation between the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, to be considered during the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly. to confirm Uzbekistans commitment to developing constructive multilateral cooperation within the framework of the United Nations for solving the most topical issues on the international agenda.
