{"speech":{"0":" I am deeply honoured to address the Republic of Moldova. At the outset, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session, to wish him success and to assure his Bureau of the full support of our delegation. I would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his high competence and professionalism, and his tireless efforts in leading the United Nations in these complex times. The distinguished speakers who have taken the floor in this debate have elaborated extensively on the most pressing issues that the international community has faced over the past year. The current financial and economic crisis, the food and energy crises, the first flu pandemic of this century, and climate change have been at the core of deliberations in the United Nations, revealing the central role of the Organization in dealing with these problems. A reformed, robust and effective Organization has to deliver prompt reactions and sustainable responses to the major challenges to peace, security and non-proliferation, climate change, food and energy security, and the spread of international terrorism. We commend the efforts of the Secretary-General in strengthening the United Nations and promoting the core values enshrined in our founding Charter: the fundamental principles of peace, justice and human rights. The Republic of Moldova supports the ongoing process of reform of the United Nations aimed at creating a revitalized, representative, efficient and more responsive Organization. Following significant advances in the reform of its principal organs, we development: disarmament and the part of recognize the steps being undertaken towards reform of the Security Council, which undoubtedly necessitates a firm political pledge on the entire membership. In our opinion, the expansion of the Security Council is a matter not only of equity but also of efficiency. Any proposal for reform of the Council has to reflect the legitimate aspirations of the regional groups. Thus, in supporting the expansion of the Council in both permanent and non-permanent categories, we believe it indispensable to allocate an additional non-permanent seat to the Eastern European Group. By virtue of the primary responsibility of the Security Council laid down in the United Nations Charter, its reform should also contain provisions for consolidating United Nations operational capacities in the field and revitalizing peacekeeping operations in order to make them more effective and capable of achieving their goals, including the development of cooperation with regional organizations and Member States for the resolution of conflicts in various areas of the globe. the greater commitment of Member States the area of disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation. We have recently witnessed a historic summit of the Security Council, which voted to stop the spread of nuclear arms and endorsed a broad framework of action to reduce global nuclear dangers.

The current global economic and financial crisis, one of the most serious since the creation of the United Nations, has affected virtually all countries, including the Republic of Moldova. In 2008, the previous Communist Government the existence of an economic and financial crisis; only after its defeat in the elections of 29 July 2009 did its representatives begin to raise the alarm. the Alliance for European Integration, is assuming full responsibility Building a safer world requires The current administration, in Chisinau denied in 23 At the the ensuring for managing the economic crisis by attracting funds from international financial organizations, securing foreign investment, providing jobs, reviving the real sector of the economy, ensuring the de-monopolization of production sectors, and liberalizing exports and imports. The liberal democratic Government relies on the support of United Nations institutions and all international structures in promoting the rule of law, safeguarding fundamental human rights and freedoms, and functionality of democratic institutions and the freedom of mass media. The Republic of Moldova followed intently the work of the high-level Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development, held this summer at the United Nations, and welcomed the adoption of its Outcome Document (resolution ). The Conference highlighted once again the role of the United Nations and gave a strong impetus to the dialogue on identifying solutions for overcoming the crisis and reforming the international financial architecture. for same strengthening the Economic and Social Councils coordinating role in formulating global economic and social policies and in further promoting active dialogue with the international financial institutions and the Governments of Member States in implementing the Millennium Development Goals. Nine years ago, in September 2000, the worlds leaders committed our countries to a global partnership in fighting poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Today, in the context of the global economic and financial crisis, considerable common efforts on the part of developed and developing countries alike are needed to achieve our commitments by 2015. We welcome the decision to convene a high- level meeting in 2010 dedicated to evaluating the Millennium Summit decisions. The General Assembly has proclaimed 2009 the International Year the International Year of Human Rights Learning, and 21 September as an International Day of Peace. It is in this vein that we would like to reiterate the necessity for an increased United Nations role and strengthened cooperation with regional organizations, such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in preventing and managing crisis and conflict situations; guaranteeing respect for and the promotion of Reconciliation time, Moldova stands and Respecting democratization the principle of of fundamental human rights in separatist regions; undertaking more efficient international actions to stabilize the situation in countries affected by internal conflict; and taking a complex approach under international law to mediation and conflict resolution. The intensification of international cooperation with a view to solving conflicts and preventing the future emergence or escalation of crisis situations that threaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States is of paramount importance for the Republic of Moldova, which faces a secessionist movement in the eastern regions of the country. the peaceful resolution of conflicts, we are confident that the demilitarization the Transdniestrian region are indispensable to a viable solution to the Transdniestrian problem. The new Liberal Democratic Governments coalition will undertake sustainable efforts to identify a lasting solution to the Transdniestrian problem in the current five plus two format and will consistently urge an increased United States and European Union (EU) role in the resolution process. Concurrently, the Republic of Moldova will revive its efforts towards the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country, replacing the present peacekeeping operation with a multinational mission with an international mandate, and achieving the integration of the country in all socio-economic segments by encouraging the broad participation of the non-governmental sector. We will consistently act in accordance with the law on the basic provisions of the Special Legal Status of Localities from the Left Bank of the Dniester River, adopted unanimously by Parliament on 22 July 2005.

Moldovan citizens to study in their native language. The implementation of democratic reforms and the normalization of the economic and social climate on the right side of the Dniester will accelerate the resolution of the Transdniestrian problem. The Republic of Moldova appreciates the activity of the EU Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine and its close cooperation with the relevant border management bodies Its contribution to border security and transparency has created a more constructive atmosphere in which to seek a resolution of the Transdniestrian problem. The Republic of Moldova will further direct its efforts to resuming negotiations in the existing format in view of resolving the Transdniestrian problem. We count on the consistent support and political will of all mediators and observers in the resolution of this conflict. Ongoing terrorist activities in various parts of the world demonstrate continuously threatens the security, fundamental democratic values, human rights and the letter of the law that are the basis of the United Nations Charter. This scourge can be defeated only by firm, common action by the international community. In this context, we would like to reaffirm the Republic of Moldova fully participates in the global fight against terrorism by implementing measures at the national level and by contributing to the international communitys efforts. The new Government of Moldova will take concrete action in accordance with international instruments, pertinent resolutions of the Security Council and relevant national documents, such as our national strategy for preventing and combating money-laundering and the financing of terrorism. In compliance with the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (see resolution ), the Republic of Moldova will further contribute to future United Nations efforts at consolidating international legislation to combat terrorism, especially in view of finalizing the comprehensive convention on international terrorism and organizing a high-level conference on terrorism under United Nations auspices. We believe that special attention needs to be paid to fighting those aspects of terrorism that are nourished by separatist tendencies that affect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. the negotiations of in combating international terrorism that terrorism that to our peoples and Climate change poses a grave challenge to the its international community. Global warming and including natural disasters, have related effects, threats to become major international security. Its consequences greatly affect vulnerable States, compromising economic growth and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. International cooperation is essential to dealing with the obvious threat of climate change. We have to raise alarm concerning the urgent need to strengthen regional and global cooperation and to enhance the assistance of donor States to developing countries and to countries with economies in transition. In recent years, the Republic of Moldova has been confronted with considerable natural calamities, from acute droughts to severe floods. Each year, the intensity and frequency of these phenomena increase. The harm caused to the population, to the agricultural and food sectors, as well as to the overall national economy is huge. In this respect, the implementation of the United Nations Conventions addressing climate change and desertification and the development of an international strategy for disaster reduction are of increasing urgency for countries severely affected by droughts and desertification. the importance of environmental protection to ensuring the sustainable development of the country, as well as the need for this issue to inform all national policies. In this connection, we welcome the outcome of last weeks Summit on Climate Change and strongly support the continuation of negotiations. We hope that we will conclude forthcoming Copenhagen Conference with a new far-reaching document. We praise the Secretary-Generals efforts in mobilizing the political will needed for the adoption of a new, equitable and ambitious agreement. The Republic of Moldova strongly supports the activity of the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis set up and led by the Secretary- General. The efficient collaboration between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions and other relevant United Nations structures, aimed at mobilizing new funds in order to overcome the global food crisis, will significantly contribute the achievement of a comprehensive action plan on food security. We support the convening of the World Summit on Food Security in Rome in November this year.
