{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, Mr. Treki, permit me on behalf of Yemen and on my own account to congratulate you on your well- deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I am confident that your long experience in the area of diplomacy, in particular Arab and African diplomacy, will ensure your skilful and able conduct of our proceedings. I wish you every success in carrying out your noble mission. I also wish to congratulate Father Miguel dEscoto Brockmann, President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session, on his efforts, which ensured the various Main Committees of the Assembly. In addition, I thank the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts to consolidate international peace and security and advance the work of the Organization. The Republic of Yemen is facing complex socio- political and development challenges, to which a number of factors have contributed, including the world financial crisis and its impact on Yemens economy, as well as an acute shortage of resources as a result of declining oil production and low prices on international markets. We also face a growing population, combined with water shortages and limited commitments by our development partners to help us combat employment opportunities and decent livelihoods for the Yemeni population. Despite those difficulties, the Yemeni citizen has the smallest share of official development assistance when compared with citizens of other least developed of development and rising unemployment and poverty countries. Undoubtedly, the success of providing poverty lack by 6 limited fighting its towards resources allocated rates have created many challenges and difficulties for our Government. The Government also faces other challenges, including, in particular, the rebellion by the Al-Hothi elements in the Sa ada governorate, who abandoned the Zaidi doctrine, which is the second most prevalent religious sect in Yemen, to embrace the beliefs of the Shi ite Twelvers sect. Although they had the right to do so as Yemenis, they exploited it to gain Shi ite support and sympathy after they had carried out an armed rebellion against the Government. These subversive groups have committed terrorist and violent acts against citizens, targeted State institutions and facilities and hampered the work of local councils, calling for changes in our democratic republican system in order to return Yemen to the days before the 26 September revolution. The Government has been compelled to deal with these destructive groups, channelling a portion of for the saboteurs and development re-establishing governmental authority and the rule of law throughout Yemen. The destructive acts carried out by these rebellious groups before the recent military operations against them caused the displacement of tens of thousands of citizens from areas affected by violence, which has recently increased as a result of military clashes. As a result of its concern about the situation of internally displaced persons the Yemeni Government has addressed that humanitarian situation responsibly and in cooperation and coordination with international and civil society humanitarian relief organizations, providing secure camps and meeting the needs of IDPs for food and health care. Here, I wish to recall that our Government has declared two cessations of hostilities during recent military operations, the second of which was in response to the appeal made and humanitarian and international organizations for the opening of safe corridors for the provision of relief to refugees. However, that ceasefire by increasing their attacks on our military forces, cutting off roads, planting mines and spreading false rumours about Government forces attacking the IDPs. The Government has established a committee to investigate the situation, although it is aware that there was no IDP camp in the area but rather a camp used as a supply centre and meeting place by the saboteurs, the saboteurs exploited Secretary-General the most (IDPs), the by among security coordination who have violated five previous agreements and returned to violent actions. I wish to highlight our commitment to the principles of guaranteeing human rights, protecting civilians from the effects of military operations and upholding the sovereignty of the Constitution and the rule of law in dealing with an internal situation caused by a group that is committing violent and terrorist acts in violation of the law and the Constitution. This challenge is growing, as can be seen from the activities of Al-Qaida elements in Yemen and their attempts to consolidate their presence in Yemen and to target our country and other States in the region. Al-Qaida is supporting the saboteurs in Sa ada, seeking to make their acts of violence and rebellion serve the interests of Al-Qaida in Yemen and to spread anarchy and instability. This highlights the need for continued Yemeni efforts to uproot terrorism and for continued international and intelligence organs, so that extremism and terrorism can be defeated. Meanwhile, a number of separatist elements are exploiting the atmosphere of democracy and freedom of thought and expression, the Governments respect for human rights, and economic difficulties and a low standard of living to promote their separatist agenda — which was rejected by the Yemeni people in 1994 — in an invitation to reject constitutional legitimacy and to conspire against the unity, security and stability of Yemen. level of expenditure required for our The Government to impose the rule of law and combat terrorism has reduced the number of employment opportunities, decent livelihoods and educational opportunities for our young people and the chance to fight poverty. Therefore, we urge the international international community, organizations and Yemens partners to join an international alliance to combat terrorism. Once again, we call upon them to shoulder their responsibilities and provide generous support to strengthen our development programmes to combat since poverty development and economic growth are important elements reducing terrorism, unemployment and achieving development. From this rostrum, we call on Yemens partners and donors to job opportunities, and provide to Yemen combating countries, in order donor in 7 its part, The difficult humanitarian situation of fulfil the pledges that they made at the November 2006 London conference in support of development. The Republic of Yemen continues to strengthen the democratic principles of its political system, reflected in political pluralism, the peaceful handover of authority, freedom of expression, respect for human rights, growing decentralization, building local government with broad powers, electoral and constitutional reform and improving partnerships with civil society organizations. Those involved in political work in Yemen agreed to postpone for two years the parliamentary elections that were to be held next April in order to reform the election law and to introduce some constitutional changes with a view to reforming the Government has governance. For introduced a system of broad local government involving the election rather than the appointment of governors with a view to bringing about further decentralization of authority. the Palestinian people under Israeli occupation should remind all in this Hall that the international community has failed to secure the legitimate demands of the Palestinian people and to assist it in establishing its own State, and that it has ignored the suffering of the Palestinian people, the systematic violation of their human rights and the increase in illegal settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories. The unjust blockade imposed on the Palestinians in Gaza makes life a tragedy for the entire population of Gaza owing to the complete disregard of the practices of the Israeli occupation relevant international resolutions and instruments, and in the light of the Israeli Government and its rejection of all initiatives aimed at moving the peace process forward, in particular with regard to the course adopted by the United States Administration to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict. We call upon our Palestinian brothers to show a spirit of national responsibility towards their people living under the yoke of occupation by unifying and putting an end to their differences so as to benefit the Palestinian issue and achieve their goals. the international community take more effective measures to achieve peace and security and to rebuild the institutions of the Somali State by urging the Transitional Federal Government to act in such a way as to contribute to the strengthening of peace and the recalcitrance shown by in violation of in Somalia calls the The situation for to to extend stability in the Horn of Africa. Here, we welcome the efforts of the Transitional Federal Government to secure peace and its administration throughout Somali territory. However, it urgently needs further support to enable it to serve the Somali people. We call on all Somali parties without exception to end their differences, to participate in national dialogue and to achieve reconciliation, putting the interests of the Somali people above all else. We call on the external parties to stop interfering in Somalias internal affairs. Instability in Somalia is adversely affecting all States of the region. The phenomenon of piracy and the increasing flow of refugees to neighbouring States, resulting from the instability in Somalia, are creating socio-economic and health difficulties for Yemen, as it bears the burden of caring for hundreds of thousands of those refugees. We call on the international community to help the Somali coast guard to protect the coasts and international maritime trade. With regard to the situation in the Sudan and in Darfur, we welcome the mediation efforts of Qatar, Libya and Egypt to achieve peace in the Sudan. We support the efforts of the international community in bringing about the reconciliation of all opposing factions, and we reiterate our call for the decision of the International Criminal Court with regard to President Omer Al-Bashir to be overturned as it does not respect the sovereignty of the Sudan and hinders the efforts for peace in the Sudan. Yemen condemns all acts of terrorism to which the Iraqi people are subjected, and we call on them to overcome their differences and to strengthen their national unity. Yemen welcomes the efforts of the Secretary- General the Organization. We reaffirm our position that the United Nations and its system should be reformed to achieve equitable representation and a better decision-making process required emphasis on development, fighting pandemics, easing poverty and addressing environmental issues, which have a direct impact on the standard of living of millions of people. We must strive to bolster the Security Councils role in the maintenance of international peace and security; at the same time we must reform the Council and expand it to make it more representative, ensure that its deliberations are more transparent and rationalize the towards reforming that places in order the 8 use of the veto so as to avoid its abuse and double standards. In conclusion, on behalf of the Government of Yemen, I would like to extend our appreciation for the good work of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in managing this Organization and in improving its work. I reiterate my congratulations to you, Mr. President, and wish you every success. "}}
