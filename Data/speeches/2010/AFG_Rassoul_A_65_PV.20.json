{"speech":{"0":" I I am confident in 26 the most effective universal body respect for human dignity. Today, the United Nations remains for preserving the principles upon which it was founded. As one of its earliest Member States, Afghanistan fully and consistently subscribes to the centrality of the United Nations and to the principles of multilateralism that guarantee a democratic international order in which we all have an equal voice and participation in decisions impacting our world. Today more than ever before, our world demands a commitment to working together so that we may overcome the multifaceted challenges and threats to our survival and well-being. The United Nations is pivotal to our ability to translate our common sense of purpose and determined political will to replace desperation with hope, poverty with prosperity, injustice with justice and violence with peace. Last week, the High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) adopted an outcome document and plan of action for the full realization of the Millennium Development Goals (resolution ). Fifteen years ago when the MDGs were adopted, we recognized that comprehensive and collective effort was essential to the attainment of the Goals. Last weeks summit again underscored the need for and coordination in order to achieve human development and well-being. Afghanistan remains fully committed to meeting its MDG targets. We have made some progress, but the scourge of insecurity and threats to the rule of law and governance remain enormous challenges to promoting human development in Afghanistan. On the eve of the ninth anniversary of the declaration of the global war on terror in October 2001, the international communitys promise to the people of Afghanistan of a life free from the fear of the threat and exploitation of international terrorism remains unfulfilled. Afghans continue to suffer from horrific acts of terrorist violence on a daily basis. On many occasions from this rostrum, the Afghan delegation has drawn the global communitys attention to the reality that terrorism and the ideologies of extremism and radicalism are spawned beyond the borders of Afghanistan. In spite of the combined efforts of our military allies, terrorists continue to infiltrate our borders with the intent of inflicting harm on our international international cooperation terrorism, enhanced they must in a strategy look beyond villages people and the brave soldiers of partner countries. As long as certain State and non-State actors provide Al-Qaida and affiliated individuals and entities with sanctuary, arms and financing, they will remain formidable and murderous adversaries. Terrorism in our region is a growing threat to world peace and security. The audacity and geographic scope of extremist and terrorist groups harboured in our region continue to expand. If our international partners and allies wish to win the global war on terrorism, in Afghanistan and engage that will effectively and decisively dismantle organizations and networks that continue to support terrorist and radical militants with impunity. Terrorism remains a global challenge that can be defeated only through a concerted international effort. In this context, Afghanistan is committed to expanding counter-terrorism cooperation with the Government of Pakistan and with other countries in our region. The people of Afghanistan have known too much violence and too much despair. We have seen too many of our young people lose their lives as a result of war and conflict. The Afghan people crave peace, stability and security. Although our fight against those who menace the lives and well-being of our people will continue unabated, we recognize that the success of our efforts for development and prosperity will depend largely on our ability to achieve sustainable peace in our country. the Afghan Government convened a National Consultative Peace Jirga in June of this year. The Jirga fulfilled President Karzais promise to consult and engage all Afghans in Jirga — which peacebuilding assembled and representatives of provincial councils, businesses and civil society, and had over 20 per cent female participation — helped to jump-start a representative peace and reconciliation process that will be pursued in conformity with our Constitution and human rights commitments. The Consultative Peace Jirga agreed on a framework to encourage the rank and file of the Taliban to end violence and to join a reconciliation and reintegration process. It defined the conditions for a peace dialogue with Taliban leaders and endorsed the leaders, parliamentarians, initiatives. The this objective With in mind, tribal 27 to to the Over remain critical realized commitment and obstacles establishment of a peace commission to oversee the reintegration of armed opposition fighters who renounce violence, resume civilian life, accept our Constitution and embrace our democracy. the past eight years, we and our international partners have substantial achievements, but also have made mistakes. Many challenges ensuring sustainable security for the people of Afghanistan and to meeting their aspirations to a better life and future. At the London and Kabul Conferences held earlier this year, the international community not only reaffirmed its safeguarding Afghanistans sovereignty, territorial integrity and stability, but also recognized importance of Afghan ownership and leadership to consolidating our joint achievements and engaging the greater confidence of the Afghan people. By building on the mutual commitments made at the milestone Conferences in London and Kabul to transfer security and development responsibilities to the Afghans, and by pursing comprehensive economic development, security, governance and our inclusive reconciliation strategies, we are convinced that we will successfully combat the efforts of extremists and terrorists seeking to regain hold of Afghanistan. For our part, the Government of Afghanistan is steadfast in its commitment to pursuing the reform agenda that President Karzai outlined in his inaugural speech. We are committed to reinforcing our social compact with the people of Afghanistan by strengthening our judiciary, combating corruption, revitalizing our economy and promoting good governance at all levels of the Government. As demonstrated by the recently held parliamentary elections, the people of Afghanistan are steadfast in advancing our democracy. the support and collaboration of our international partners and allies, we are committed to enhancing the capacity and ability of the Afghan Security Forces to assume greater responsibility for the protection and security of our country. In this context, I wish to acknowledge the enhanced effort of our military allies to protect our civilian populations from the detrimental effects of military operations against the terrorists and militants. The people of Afghanistan embrace the challenge of building a better future. However, the insidious the Government and With fight against dangers of extremism and terrorism and their ever- increasing link to narcotics pose a serious threat to the security and stability of our country and our region. Alongside our terrorism, we are committed to working closely with our neighbours and other international partners to win the war on narcotics. To complement our efforts to eliminate poppy production, we wish to see greater action to counter smuggling of precursors into our country and to reduce the demand for and consumption of drugs in other countries. Recent climate-induced disasters experienced in our region, such as the catastrophic floods in Pakistan, not only pose severe challenges for local populations and national Governments, but may also have ramifications for the economies of countries in the region and for global security. We see increased urgency for effective regional collaboration on disaster mitigation and response. At various international, regional and subregional gatherings, we have emphasized the importance of a stable, democratic and moderate Afghanistan to the economic development of our region and global security. By virtue of its location at the crossroads of four geostrategically important regions — Central Asia, South Asia, China and the Middle East — Afghanistan could play an important role in facilitating increased the enormous potential of our region. We will work towards further gains in trade and transit with countries in the region. the Afghanistan- Pakistan- Transit Trade Agreement and the signing by the heads of State of Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India of an agreement on a gas pipeline project regional cooperation. In addition, we have concluded the feasibility study for a Central Asia-South Asia project for the transfer of electricity from Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to Afghanistan and Pakistan. These initiatives will contribute greatly to peace, security and stability in our region. Afghanistan stands ready to step up cooperation with all its neighbours on economic, political and crime-related issues. I have spoken of the desire of the people of Afghanistan for peace and stability and of our right to them. We are, however, acutely aware that for over half a century our brothers and sisters in Palestine have transit and unleashing recent conclusion of are milestones trade and increased The for 28 to the revitalize been denied their right to an independent State living in peaceful coexistence with its neighbours. We are encouraged by the resumption of direct talks between the Israeli and Palestinian leadership, which give us hope that sustainable peace in the Middle East may be secured. To conclude, I thank the States members of this Assembly for their solidarity and their support for the liberty and well-being of the people of Afghanistan. The Afghan people will never forget the generosity and great sacrifices of the United States, NATO and other international partners, whose men and women have bravely stood with us to defend our common security and ensure peace and stability for Afghanistan. I thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his efforts sense of partnership, cooperation and confidence between Afghanistan and the international community. I also thank the dedicated and committed staff of the United Nations and its specialized agencies for helping the Afghan people build a peaceful, secure and prosperous future. "}}
