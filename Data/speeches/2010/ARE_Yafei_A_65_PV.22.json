{"speech":{"0":" I thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the floor to comment on the remarks by the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran. My delegation expresses its regret at the repeated position of Iran, which has rejected the numerous peace initiatives my country has announced to resolve the conflict over the three occupied Emirates islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb through bilateral negotiations or the International Court of Justice to seek a legal opinion. We reiterate our rejection of Irans occupation and of all military and civilian measures it has taken on the islands with a view to changing their historical and three commissions. Two of through recourse established that The United Arab Emirates hopes demographic nature and imposing a fait accompli of occupation. We are disappointed that Iran has repeated its position calling for dealing with marginal issues pertaining to the outcome of the occupation of the islands, rather than dealing with the main issue of occupation itself. the international community will support its position, which calls upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to reconsider its policy of illegal occupation of the islands and to respond to our peace initiatives, which aim at reaching a comprehensive and just settlement to the issue of these islands in a manner that strengthens security, stability and economic cooperation among the countries of the region. Mr. Nunez Mosquera (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): I marvel at seeing how the Permanent Representative of Sweden, representative of a supposedly civilized and incorruptible country, assumes the right to judge other countries — always poor and underdeveloped countries of the South — on the issue of human rights. The Ambassador spoke, judged, handed down his verdict and abandoned the Hall. I asked him to stay to hear my reply, but he left. I ask myself with what right and moral authority he dares to judge and give opinions on no fewer than eight countries that are respectable and worthy Members of this Organization. Who told him that he could lecture Cubans on human rights, something about which we are deeply proud? As the entire international community is aware, Sweden is among the countries to have authorized illegal secret flights over its territory by the United States Central Intelligence Agency. That is a dark chapter in Swedens actions, which it has yet to clarify. When one asks a Swedish official about this, they say that the relevant investigations are being carried out. They have been investigating for several years. They are trying to cover up the issue, but peoples do not have such short memories. I could also refer to the situation of prostitution in Sweden and of the assaults, including sexual abuse, against women and girls in that country. But, in the interests of time, I shall not do so. I merely ask: When is its investigations on the illegal flights over its territory? When will the Swedish Government renounce double standards and political manipulation on such a noble the Swedish Government going to finish to 47 It was therefore shocking issue as human rights? How long will they try to continue to mislead the General Assembly? Mr. Tag-Eldin (Egypt): I take the floor in the exercise of the right of reply to respond to the false allegation made in the statement that was delivered by the representative of Sweden, which included baseless claims about the situation of the freedom of expression in my country, among other countries. The representative of Sweden should know better. He should know that Egypt has been in the lead of political reform in the Middle East. Freedom of expression is guaranteed, by our constitution and practice, to each and every Egyptian citizen. In Egypt, we have more than 300 newspapers and journals published daily, representing all views from every corner of Egyptian society and political life. the representative of Sweden refer to my country in this manner. We would like to advise the representative of Sweden to become better educated about Egypt and its comprehensive reforms aimed at ensuring a better life for Egyptian citizens and guaranteeing full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of expression. Egypt totally and flatly rejects such allegations. The representative of Sweden should know the difference between freedom of expression and insulting prophets and defaming religions in his country, before evaluating the situation of freedom of expression in other countries. Mr. Ren Yisheng (China) (spoke in Chinese): I would like to speak in exercise of the right of reply with the representative of Sweden. The Chinese Government has always protected the economic, social and cultural rights of its citizens, in keeping with the law. Our Government attaches equal to other categories of rights such as freedom of expression. Since the beginning of the reform process, the human statement made by importance to hear respect to the rights situation in China has greatly improved. This is something that is recognized by everybody; something that no one can deny. In the course of its history, Sweden has seen some dark incidents of human rights violations. Today it continues to violate the rights of minorities within its borders. One might say the human rights situation in Sweden is rather sombre. That country does not have the right to point fingers at others over human rights situations. Without mentioning the human rights situation in his own country, the representative of Sweden commented on human rights situations in other countries. This utterly twists the truth and is a clear example of double standards. The Chinese delegation categorically rejects the unfounded accusations made by the representative of Sweden. "}}
