{"speech":{"0":" I would like to exercise the right of reply to the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Armenia on 21 September in the general debate of the General Assembly (see ). The statement of the Armenian Foreign Minister was yet another solid piece of evidence of that countrys outrageous racist ideology, as well as of its annexationist intentions and unwillingness to settle the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict in accordance with international law, by political means and in a constructive manner. There can be no doubt that the issue that Yerevan purports to advocate denotes a culture of impunity and the promotion of dangerous ideas of superiority and expansionism, based on the open ethnic and religious prejudices prevailing in Armenias policy and practice. The documentary evidence — and there is a mountain of it — proves that Armenia unleashed the war, attacked Azerbaijan, occupied its ancestral territories, including the Nagorny Karabakh region and several adjacent districts, carried out ethnic cleansing on a massive scale, and established a subordinate separatist entity on captured Azerbaijani territory along ethnic lines. The war led to the death and wounding of thousands of Azerbaijanis, the majority of them women, the elderly and children. It is essential to note that what the Armenian side considers to be the exercise of the right to self-determination by the Armenian minority group in Azerbaijan has been unambiguously qualified by the Security Council and the General Assembly, as well as by other authoritative international organizations, as the illegal use of force against the sovereign and territorial integrity of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Consequently, the claims of Armenia — which resorted to the unlawful use of force to occupy the territory of Azerbaijan and committed the most serious international crimes, such as war crimes, crimes against humanity and even genocide — are contrary to and unsustainable under international law. Thus, the destructive political agenda of Armenia, aimed at dismembering multi-ethnic societies and legalizing a product of aggression and an outrageous manifestation of ethnic differentiation, is fated never to be realized. Armenia must finally realize that, for the purposes of lasting peace and stability, there is no alternative but to put a prompt end to its illegal occupation of Azerbaijani territory, renounce its policy of ethnic hatred towards and territorial claims on neighbouring nations, and establish civilized relations with all regional countries. Mr. Kazhoyan (Armenia): I apologize for asking for the floor, but it is really impossible to remain silent 23 after what has just been said by the representative of Azerbaijan. The reference to the so-called military expansionism of Armenia made by the representative was totally misleading. Armenia has never started any aggression whatsoever. Moreover, it was Azerbaijan that started a full-scale war against the peaceful population of Nagorny Karabakh, forcing them to take up arms in order to protect their lives and homes. The current situation in the region is the consequence of Azerbaijans own decision to use military force to suppress the legitimate, just and peaceful quest of the people of Nagorny Karabakh to exercise their right to self-determination, which is guaranteed by international law and the United Nations Charter. Indeed, it is Azerbaijan that is in violation not only of the resolutions of the Security Council, which in fact urge the concerned parties to pursue negotiations within the framework of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as direct contact between them. Azerbaijans refusal to engage in direct negotiations with the elected representatives of the Nagorny Karabakh Republic and its hostile stance towards anything Armenian are the main impediments to the solution of the Nagorny Karabakh issue. Meanwhile, what Azerbaijani representatives continuously fail to acknowledge is that Armenia has done exactly what the Security Council resolutions have called on it to do — to use its good offices with the leadership of Nagorny Karabakh to help find a peaceful solution to the conflict. A ceasefire has been in place since 1994, and now it is high time to find a comprehensive peaceful solution to the issue so that the people throughout our region can live in peace, prosperity and harmony. Mr. Kim Moonhwan (Republic of Korea): I would like to exercise the right of reply in response to the statement delivered by the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea this morning (see ). First, regarding the tragic sinking of the Republic of Koreas naval ship Cheonan, the findings of the joint investigation group on the sinking of the Cheonan naval vessel were the result of a thorough, objective and scientific investigation, with the participation of five nations: the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Sweden. Those findings were endorsed by the international community in the presidential statement adopted by the Security Council on 9 July 2010. In that regard, I would like to reiterate that the Security Council presidential statement stipulates that: “The Security Council underscores the importance of preventing further such attacks or hostilities against the Republic of Korea or in the region” (PRS, p. 2). The unprovoked attack constituted a grave violation of the Armistice Agreement and the principles of the United Nations Charter. In that context, allow me to clarify the Democratic Peoples Republic of Koreas proposal to send its inspection team. My delegation wants to emphasize that there already exists an established mechanism for military talks. General officer-level talks between the United Nations Command (UNC) and the North Korean Peoples Army (KPA) have been the designated forum for any Armistice-related issues, in accordance with the agreement reached between the UNC and the KPA in 1998. Since then, the UNC-KPA general officer-level talks have dealt with other cases of violation of the Armistice Agreement. In addition, my delegation is compelled to refute the arguments expressed by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea in claiming that it is a nuclear-weapon State. In that regard, my delegation wishes to draw attention to the final document of the eighth NPT Review Conference adopted last May, which clearly reaffirmed that the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea cannot have the status of a nuclear-weapon State in accordance with the NPT.
