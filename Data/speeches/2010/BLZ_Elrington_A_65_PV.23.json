{"speech":{"0":" Please permit me, Sir, on behalf of the Belize delegation to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the sixty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly. As much as our peoples share common values of peace and democracy, your country and my own could not be more different. Switzerland is landlocked with a land mass twice the size and a population 25 times that of my coastal country. Belize has a $1 billion economy and Switzerland has a $400 billion economy. Nominal gross domestic product per capita in Switzerland is estimated at $67,000, while in Belize that figure is roughly $4,000. I bring up the differences between Belize and Switzerland because they are illustrative of the stark differences that epitomize todays world. We in this Hall tout sovereign equality, but we experience social and economic disparity on a daily basis, across the globe. Inequality persists between nations and within nations. Poverty proliferates in the midst of plenty. In my own country, although real output per capita grew over the past 10 years, so too did the proportion of Belizeans living in poverty. In other words, the commensurate we experienced growth without development of our people. Belize accepts that development is a matter of national responsibility. However, our contemporary reality now renders questions that were hitherto matters of national concern, matters of global concern. As a consequence of globalization, the management capacity of a State has diminished. Our macroeconomic policy and fiscal capacity cannot adequately address the multiple exogenous shocks occasioned, inter alia, by the triumvirate of the financial, food and fuel crises. Adequate and appropriate international support at this time is therefore critical if we are to avoid drifting further and further away from the attainment of our development goals. In that connection, developed nations urgently need to make good their promise to deliver 0.7 per cent of their GDP for official development assistance (ODA). For Belize, meaningful international support is becoming increasingly harder to come by because of our designation as a middle-income country. While we continue to benefit from ODA and foreign direct investment in our quest to further integrate Belize into the global economy, for the most part expensive foreign and local commercial debt has in fact fuelled the countrys development strategy. Thus, in the past 15 years, Belize has built up a high level of public debt, with high-cost long-term financing. The ratio of public debt to GDP grew steadily, from about 27 per cent in 1995 to 70.3 per cent in 2008, with a peak of 87 per cent in 2005.

(E) *1055396* in one slippage threatens debt-led strategy, which was the model of many other countries, will surely become an unwelcome and unwanted burden for our children. Perennial debt-servicing obligations constrain my Governments capacity to increase social investments, especially in those areas where they are most needed. It is therefore not surprising that Belize finds itself off track in meeting Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) on poverty, hunger, education and the empowerment of women. Considering the synergies between Goals, the achievement of others. The terms of engagement between international financial institutions and middle-income countries must be revised if countries such as my own are to break away from the vicious cycle of debt-led development. While those terms will necessarily have to provide for suitable risk-mitigation strategies, they should not be so burdensome as to constrain our policy space. They must respect the national ownership of our development initiatives. International cooperation and support therefore must complement, rather than dictate, the way forward. long provided valuable assistance, for which we will always be grateful, we are now benefiting from new modalities of cooperation, which are yielding more direct and immediate returns for our people. Belizes cooperation experience with Taiwan exemplifies a model of cooperation based on partnership. With the help of the Government of Taiwan, Belize has steadily developed its capacity in agricultural research, aquaculture, education and social-sector investment. In the Latin American and Caribbean region, cooperation has long been based on that approach. Belize has benefited immensely from partnerships with Cuba, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela. Of special significance is the cooperation in the health sector. In fact, today the progress that we can claim on the health-related MDGs is a testament, in part, to those partnerships. Beyond our hemispheric relations, we are forging new partnerships. We recently received two years worth of emergency relief materials from the United Arab Emirates, for which we are most appreciative, given the frequency of hurricane visitations to our shores in recent years. Through those partnerships, Belize is being enabled to pursue its broader national traditional donors have While Belizes Current structures decision-making development objectives. Our experience is being replicated the world over, as we see in other examples of South-South cooperation. We need now to make those partnerships the standard for global cooperation. At the United Nations, we have long focused on official development assistance as being synonymous with global partnerships. That myopic view needs to be broadened, and we must disabuse ourselves of the donor-driven dialectic. The United Nations has the responsibility to craft a new orientation, from a donor- recipient culture to one of true partnership with mutual respect. As every speaker in this debate has emphasized, in order for this institution to meet that challenge, it must itself reform. and organization tend towards a North-South polarity. That dynamic imperils cooperation and renders debate more ceremony than meaningful dialogue. Over the 65 years of the United Nations existence, our world has changed. We are dealing with new realities. The Organization is nearly universal, with 192 countries represented here. The club of nuclear-power States has expanded, and may yet continue to expand. Global integration has deepened with technology, market liberalization and the freer movement of capital. Our interdependence has generated global systemic risks. We need a United Nations that reflects more equitable North-South representation and that can effectively deliver. That means that the organs of the United Nations must be reformed. The process of decision-making must ensure coherence and be inclusive. Above all, equity and justice must inform our mechanisms for delivery. The reform we seek goes much deeper than the changing of the guards; it is a reform that would rebuild trust among each other and confidence in the system. Belize is crafting a twenty-first century vision for a modern, green and sustainable economy predicated human on development and is working towards building domestic capital through social investments, job creation, improved access to credit and combating crime and violence. To that end, we have launched project Restore Belize, which encompasses a comprehensive anti-crime initiative socio-economic innovation. Our Government capacity-building, complemented dignity, human by a 2 for for the adults, onward lending through education corporation that we achieve the provision of skills component aimed at restoring the social fabric of our society training, continuing infrastructure development and fostering civic pride. We have instituted school feeding programmes, subsidies for students of secondary schools, seed programmes for farmers and capitalization of our own development finance to entrepreneurs. The Government has also undertaken a national multiparty and multisectoral consultative process to redefine our national development objectives in our Horizon 2030 project. In addition, the Prime Minister has established a council of science advisers to better inform the Horizon 2030 process on the integration of science and technology in the national development agenda. Belize is resolutely embracing its responsibility for its national development. Our efforts are aimed towards ensuring type of development that genuinely affords all our people the opportunity to realize their true potential with dignity. To that end, we seek only empathy and partnership from the United Nations, not charity. "}}
