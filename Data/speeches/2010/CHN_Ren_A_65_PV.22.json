{"speech":{"0":" I would like to speak in exercise of the right of reply with the representative of Sweden. The Chinese Government has always protected the economic, social and cultural rights of its citizens, in keeping with the law. Our Government attaches equal to other categories of rights such as freedom of expression. Since the beginning of the reform process, the human statement made by importance to hear respect to the rights situation in China has greatly improved. This is something that is recognized by everybody; something that no one can deny. In the course of its history, Sweden has seen some dark incidents of human rights violations. Today it continues to violate the rights of minorities within its borders. One might say the human rights situation in Sweden is rather sombre. That country does not have the right to point fingers at others over human rights situations. Without mentioning the human rights situation in his own country, the representative of Sweden commented on human rights situations in other countries. This utterly twists the truth and is a clear example of double standards. The Chinese delegation categorically rejects the unfounded accusations made by the representative of Sweden. "}}
