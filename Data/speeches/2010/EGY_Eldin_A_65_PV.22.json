{"speech":{"0":" I take the floor in the exercise of the right of reply to respond to the false allegation made in the statement that was delivered by the representative of Sweden, which included baseless claims about the situation of the freedom of expression in my country, among other countries. The representative of Sweden should know better. He should know that Egypt has been in the lead of political reform in the Middle East. Freedom of expression is guaranteed, by our constitution and practice, to each and every Egyptian citizen. In Egypt, we have more than 300 newspapers and journals published daily, representing all views from every corner of Egyptian society and political life. It was therefore shocking to hear the representative of Sweden refer to my country in this manner. We would like to advise the representative of Sweden to become better educated about Egypt and its comprehensive reforms aimed at ensuring a better life for Egyptian citizens and guaranteeing full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of expression. Egypt totally and flatly rejects such allegations. The representative of Sweden should know the difference between freedom of expression and insulting prophets and defaming religions in his country, before evaluating the situation of freedom of expression in other countries. Mr. Ren Yisheng (China) (spoke in Chinese): I would like to speak in exercise of the right of reply with respect to the statement made by the representative of Sweden. The Chinese Government has always protected the economic, social and cultural rights of its citizens, in keeping with the law. Our Government attaches equal importance to other categories of rights such as freedom of expression. Since the beginning of the reform process, the human rights situation in China has greatly improved. This is something that is recognized by everybody; something that no one can deny. In the course of its history, Sweden has seen some dark incidents of human rights violations. Today it continues to violate the rights of minorities within its borders. One might say the human rights situation in Sweden is rather sombre. That country does not have the right to point fingers at others over human rights situations. Without mentioning the human rights situation in his own country, the representative of Sweden commented on human rights situations in other countries. This utterly twists the truth and is a clear example of double standards. The Chinese delegation categorically rejects the unfounded accusations made by the representative of Sweden. "}}
