{"speech":{"0":" I am taking the floor in exercise of the right of reply in connection with the statement made by His Excellency the Foreign Minister of Ethiopia this morning. Clearly, the Foreign Minister was trying to divert the attention of this body from his countrys refusal to withdraw its troops from southern Eritrean territories and his Governments military misadventures in Somalia. Eritrea rejects all unfounded allegations, and I do not wish to dignify all of those made this morning by trying to address them at this late hour. In the interests of time, I will briefly respond to the main issue at hand. Eritrea does not have problems with its neighbours, and if it has had in the past, it has been able to resolve them successfully, peacefully and legally, with the exception of its issues with Ethiopia. Ethiopia cannot hide behind the Security Council resolution mentioned by the Foreign Minister. Its attempt to find comfort in a resolution and to use Eritrea as a scapegoat for the problems of Somalia is misplaced criticism, and when no evidence was found to substantiate Eritreas alleged support to the insurgents in Somalia, all eyes turned to Ethiopia. Even some members of the Transitional Federal Government admit that Ethiopia is using the Security Council resolution to pursue its own hidden agenda. More and more voices are being raised to critically examine Ethiopias self-serving policies and actions in Somalia. Some sources are certain that Ethiopia, with a standing army of about 800,000 — the largest in sub-Saharan Africa — receives about $2 billion worth of military support per annum, which is used to supply Somalia and in turn feeds insurgencies. The Government in Addis must be held accountable for its destabilizing policies and actions, and it must be able to separate itself from the political affairs of Somalia. Unless it does so, the problems in Somalia and in the subregion will continue. I wish to underscore the fact that Ethiopia has been the only constant factor throughout the political crisis in Somalia. Furthermore, that regime has been a cancer in the Horn of Africa. It is a very well-known fact that Ethiopias invasion of Somalia in 2006 20 contributed to the rise of the Al-Shabaab group. Ethiopias occupation of Somalia not only created the greatest humanitarian crisis in Africa, but also significantly contributed to the destabilization of the country. Approximately 1.5 million Somalis were displaced and over 20,000 lives lost through its genocidal acts, which deserve thorough investigation by the relevant international bodies. The withdrawal of Ethiopian troops from Somalia was a face-saving measure for the Government in Ethiopia. Yet, refusing to learn from its military misadventures in Somalia, the Government of Ethiopia has again sent troops to central Somalia to continue its military and political interference in the affairs of that country. These acts should not be tolerated by any standard, and in particular not by the Security Council. The special treatment of Ethiopia is glaringly obvious and becoming a source of problems for the peace and stability of the subregion. Let all countries be subject to the same standards and set of rules, especially the Charter of the United Nations, which forbids military intervention unless it is authorized by the Security Council. While I have the floor, let me clarify Eritreas views on Somalia. Eritrea supports an inclusive peace process that allows all Somalis in the Government and outside the Government to come to the negotiating table. The peace process should be Somali-owned and Somali-driven, and Eritrea will continue to work constructively with all Somalis and the United Nations to achieve those objectives. Let me conclude by pointing out that Ethiopia has become part of the problem in Somalia, and that must be stopped if a Somali-owned and Somali-driven inclusive peace process is to take root in Somalia. Let me also urge the international community to call on Ethiopia to end its occupation of sovereign Eritrean territories in order to ensure a stable and secure subregion in Africa. Mr. Abay (Ethiopia): I am taking the floor in the exercise of the right of reply with regard to allegations directed at my Government by the Permanent Representative of Eritrea to the United Nations. Eritrea has been and is destabilizing the Horn of Africa, and that is a fact. Its sponsorship of various terrorist groups in the region has a long history, and that is another well-known truth. Nonetheless, despite its destructive role in the Horn, the international community has failed to take tangible measures commensurate with its bellicose nature. Late last year, the Security Council at last, after a long delay, imposed targeted sanctions on the Eritrean regime. Resolution 1907 (2009) was specifically aimed at trying to persuade Eritrea to mend its ways and to behave in a civilized and peaceful manner. Sanctions also underlined the message that international relations are governed by international law, which must be applied to its fullest extent. Eritrea cannot use its own excuses, real or imagined, to justify aggression against its neighbours, the blatant acts of destabilization it has been undertaking throughout the region, or the role it continues to play by supporting extremist elements in Somalia. Although evidence has never been in short supply, addressing the root cause of problems has never been Eritreas leaders strong point. That is why, ever since the imposition of the sanctions, the regime in Asmara has been waging a feverish campaign — as it has been doing this afternoon — to deflect attention from itself and to appear to be the underdog. Part of that campaign are Eritreas attempts at a make-believe fairy tale concerning the so-called occupied sovereign territories. I believe that my delegation responded adequately to this Eritrean mantra at yesterdays meeting (see ), and I will therefore not test the indulgence of members by repeating the same again today. What I would rather focus on this afternoon is the need to stay the course. The sanctions imposed by the Security Council in resolution 1907 (2009) have already had some impact. What is needed now is to firmly implement the sanctions policy, to exert more pressure on Eritrea and not to allow any backsliding on the issue just because of certain fictitious good behaviour that seems to have nearly seduced some quarters within the international community. The time is therefore long overdue for the Security Council to take resolute action and see to it that its decisions are complied with fully. With regard to the Ethiopian-Eritrean issue raised by the representative of Eritrea this afternoon, let me reiterate that Ethiopia agrees with the constantly affirmed view of the Security Council that the primary responsibility for the resolution of the dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea rests entirely upon themselves. Eritrea should realize that the solution on boundary or 21 any other differences can be found only by the two parties in a peaceful manner. Dialogue is the only way forward. Eritrea must understand that the option of violence is a complete non-starter. Mr. Sial (Pakistan): I am exercising the right of reply in response to some incorrect assertions made by the Minister for External Affairs of India in his statement delivered today in the general debate (see ). The Indian Minister for External Affairs once again made the self-serving claim that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India. Nothing could be further from reality and the truth. Jammu and Kashmir is an internationally recognized disputed territory that is still on the United Nations agenda. The United Nations has adopted more than a dozen resolutions calling for the settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute through a free and fair plebiscite under United Nations auspices. Numerous undertakings and statements made solemnly by the first Prime Minister of India are on record testifying to that fact. In his statement, the Indian Minister for External Affairs reaffirmed the resolve of his Government and the more than 1 billion people of India to stand by the commitments made by their first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. We welcome that reaffirmation. I would like to draw his attention to Prime Minister Nehrus commitments on Kashmir. On 2 January 1952, in Calcutta, Prime Minister Nehru said, “Kashmir is not the property of either India or Pakistan. It belongs to the Kashmiri people. When Kashmir acceded to India, we made it clear to the leaders of the Kashmiri people that we would ultimately abide by the verdict of their plebiscite. If they tell us to walk out, I would have no hesitation in quitting. We have taken the issue to the United Nations and given our word of honour for a peaceful solution. As a great nation, we cannot go back on it. We have left the question for final solution to the people of Kashmir and we are determined to abide by their decision.” It is amazing that a country that continues to violate several United Nations resolutions, including those of the Security Council, and fails to fulfil the commitments made by its leaders both to the international community and to the people of Indian-occupied Kashmir, not only has the audacity to claim democratic and pluralistic credentials, but also aspires to become a permanent member of the Security Council. As regards human rights violations, Pakistan has only echoed what has been said and reported both by international and Indian human rights non-governmental organizations and media about the ongoing situation, resulting in brutal violations of the human rights of Kashmiris in Indian-occupied Kashmir. If it pains India to listen to the truth from Pakistan, I can quote a number of statements made by members of the international community as well as well-reputed international and Indian non-governmental organizations that have expressed similar serious concerns. On 21 September 2010, the Secretary-General expressed regret for the loss of lives in Indian-occupied Kashmir and called for an immediate end to violence. Amnesty International, on 17 September, commenting on the increasing death toll in peaceful protests in Kashmir, called on the Indian authorities to take urgent steps to ensure respect for the right to life and to investigate killings of demonstrators by police. Human Rights Watch on the same day pronounced that Kashmiris had repeatedly been left without any justice. It called on the Indian authorities to abide by and implement the United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. Despite the use of brute force by Indian security forces, the recent widespread indigenous, peaceful and unarmed movement by the people in Indian-occupied Kashmir has once again proved the fact that Kashmiris despise the Indian occupation of their land and persist in their demand for the right to self-determination in accordance with Security Council resolutions. India has a tendency to malign Pakistan on the issue of terrorism in order to conceal the State terrorism it uses to stifle Kashmiri voices demanding the right to self-determination. Pakistans role in fighting terrorism has been well acknowledged by the international community. Although we are a victim of terrorism, our resolve to fight that menace has not wavered. The security forces of Pakistan continue to shed their blood in the fight against terrorism in order to make this world safer. On the other hand, there are countries that continue to provide unlimited supplies of weapons and 22 money to those enemies of humanity who want to play havoc with our civilized societies. We need no exhortations on that account from anyone. The Indian Government is well advised to take careful stock of its own policies and conduct, which include supporting terrorist elements in neighbouring countries that contribute to the problems facing South Asia. It was also India that conceived, created and nurtured the most lethal terrorist organization to introduce suicide bombings to our region. Yet, India still has the nerve to give lectures on morality to others. The legitimate struggle of peoples for the right to self-determination cannot be equated with terrorism. The only real foreign hand involved in terrorist activities, resulting in dramatic and massive abuses of the human rights of the Kashmiri people, is that of Indian State terrorism let loose by occupation forces under draconian laws that provide the licence to kill and maim innocent Kashmiris. It is a known fact that more than 700,000 Indian security personnel are deployed in Indian-occupied Kashmir — the largest concentration of troops anywhere in the world. One wonders how such a huge concentration of armed forces, backed by the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, can give Kashmiris lessons on pluralism and democracy. Pakistan remains committed to the peaceful resolution of all issues with India through a comprehensive and sustained dialogue. A peaceful and comprehensive resolution of the Kashmir dispute, in accordance with the wishes and aspirations of the Kashmiri people, will bring lasting peace not only between Pakistan and India, but to the South Asia region and beyond. Addressing the human rights concerns and ensuring the fundamental freedoms of the people of Indian-occupied Kashmir are the first step in that direction. I hope that this well-meaning advice will find receptive ears in the Indian establishment. Mr. Mehdiyev (Azerbaijan): I would like to exercise the right of reply to the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Armenia on 21 September in the general debate of the General Assembly (see ). The statement of the Armenian Foreign Minister was yet another solid piece of evidence of that countrys outrageous racist ideology, as well as of its annexationist intentions and unwillingness to settle the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict in accordance with international law, by political means and in a constructive manner. There can be no doubt that the issue that Yerevan purports to advocate denotes a culture of impunity and the promotion of dangerous ideas of superiority and expansionism, based on the open ethnic and religious prejudices prevailing in Armenias policy and practice. The documentary evidence — and there is a mountain of it — proves that Armenia unleashed the war, attacked Azerbaijan, occupied its ancestral territories, including the Nagorny Karabakh region and several adjacent districts, carried out ethnic cleansing on a massive scale, and established a subordinate separatist entity on captured Azerbaijani territory along ethnic lines. The war led to the death and wounding of thousands of Azerbaijanis, the majority of them women, the elderly and children. It is essential to note that what the Armenian side considers to be the exercise of the right to self-determination by the Armenian minority group in Azerbaijan has been unambiguously qualified by the Security Council and the General Assembly, as well as by other authoritative international organizations, as the illegal use of force against the sovereign and territorial integrity of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Consequently, the claims of Armenia — which resorted to the unlawful use of force to occupy the territory of Azerbaijan and committed the most serious international crimes, such as war crimes, crimes against humanity and even genocide — are contrary to and unsustainable under international law. Thus, the destructive political agenda of Armenia, aimed at dismembering multi-ethnic societies and legalizing a product of aggression and an outrageous manifestation of ethnic differentiation, is fated never to be realized. Armenia must finally realize that, for the purposes of lasting peace and stability, there is no alternative but to put a prompt end to its illegal occupation of Azerbaijani territory, renounce its policy of ethnic hatred towards and territorial claims on neighbouring nations, and establish civilized relations with all regional countries. Mr. Kazhoyan (Armenia): I apologize for asking for the floor, but it is really impossible to remain silent 23 after what has just been said by the representative of Azerbaijan. The reference to the so-called military expansionism of Armenia made by the representative was totally misleading. Armenia has never started any aggression whatsoever. Moreover, it was Azerbaijan that started a full-scale war against the peaceful population of Nagorny Karabakh, forcing them to take up arms in order to protect their lives and homes. The current situation in the region is the consequence of Azerbaijans own decision to use military force to suppress the legitimate, just and peaceful quest of the people of Nagorny Karabakh to exercise their right to self-determination, which is guaranteed by international law and the United Nations Charter. Indeed, it is Azerbaijan that is in violation not only of the resolutions of the Security Council, which in fact urge the concerned parties to pursue negotiations within the framework of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as direct contact between them. Azerbaijans refusal to engage in direct negotiations with the elected representatives of the Nagorny Karabakh Republic and its hostile stance towards anything Armenian are the main impediments to the solution of the Nagorny Karabakh issue. Meanwhile, what Azerbaijani representatives continuously fail to acknowledge is that Armenia has done exactly what the Security Council resolutions have called on it to do — to use its good offices with the leadership of Nagorny Karabakh to help find a peaceful solution to the conflict. A ceasefire has been in place since 1994, and now it is high time to find a comprehensive peaceful solution to the issue so that the people throughout our region can live in peace, prosperity and harmony. Mr. Kim Moonhwan (Republic of Korea): I would like to exercise the right of reply in response to the statement delivered by the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea this morning (see ). First, regarding the tragic sinking of the Republic of Koreas naval ship Cheonan, the findings of the joint investigation group on the sinking of the Cheonan naval vessel were the result of a thorough, objective and scientific investigation, with the participation of five nations: the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Sweden. Those findings were endorsed by the international community in the presidential statement adopted by the Security Council on 9 July 2010. In that regard, I would like to reiterate that the Security Council presidential statement stipulates that: “The Security Council underscores the importance of preventing further such attacks or hostilities against the Republic of Korea or in the region” (PRS, p. 2). The unprovoked attack constituted a grave violation of the Armistice Agreement and the principles of the United Nations Charter. In that context, allow me to clarify the Democratic Peoples Republic of Koreas proposal to send its inspection team. My delegation wants to emphasize that there already exists an established mechanism for military talks. General officer-level talks between the United Nations Command (UNC) and the North Korean Peoples Army (KPA) have been the designated forum for any Armistice-related issues, in accordance with the agreement reached between the UNC and the KPA in 1998. Since then, the UNC-KPA general officer-level talks have dealt with other cases of violation of the Armistice Agreement. In addition, my delegation is compelled to refute the arguments expressed by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea in claiming that it is a nuclear-weapon State. In that regard, my delegation wishes to draw attention to the final document of the eighth NPT Review Conference adopted last May, which clearly reaffirmed that the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea cannot have the status of a nuclear-weapon State in accordance with the NPT.
