{"speech":{"0":" Let me start by extending my sincere congratulations to you, Mr. President, and your country, Switzerland, for your election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I am confident that with your extensive experience and diplomatic skill, you will lead this session to a successful conclusion. I pledge the support of the Eritrean delegation in your noble efforts for the common good. to commend your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, President of the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session, for his excellent leadership. He indeed served us well. I would also like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki moon for his leadership and his report on the work of our United Nations at the outset of this general debate (see ). We meet again, at this sixty-fifth session of the Assembly, to expound on the state of our individual countries and to reflect on regional, continental and global affairs. We come to this gathering year after year to share our thoughts and explain our positions on some issues of interest. Yet we realize that the outcome of our deliberations and resolutions falls far short of our own expectations, let alone the aspirations of humanity. We agree that the institutions and procedures of this Organization have long outlived their time, and yet we remain paralysed in our efforts to transform the United Nations. While the prospects for a rapid reform of the United Nations system appear to be dim, we cannot and will not give up. We have to continue to speak out and work tirelessly for a United Nations that is fit for the twenty-first century and for a more just and equitable world. At the same time, we have to focus on our own nations and regions to ensure a peaceful and stable environment and a dignified life for our peoples. It is that perspective that informs Eritreas policies at the national, regional and international levels. Internationally, Eritrea seeks, through robust and constructive its modest contribution to global peace, security, justice and equity and to the protection and enhancement of the engagement, to make in the parties to to support to contribute its history. Eritrea believes environment in the face of changes that threaten the very survival of humanity. Regionally, Eritreas efforts are directed at securing peace, stability, development and cooperation in the wider Horn of Africa and the Red Sea regions. We endeavour transforming our dangerous neighbourhood, a neighbourhood mired in numerous conflicts, into a cooperative and peaceful region. In that connection, I wish to touch upon some of Eritreas immediate concerns. In regard to the Sudan, Eritrea is working closely with the Sudanese parties and with regional and international actors as the country enters a critical the period that international community as a whole needs to wholeheartedly the Comprehensive Peace Agreement as they approach the momentous referendum date in January 2011, and beyond. Irrespective of the outcome of the referendum, relations of trust and cooperation between the parties are crucial for peace and stability, not only in the north and south, but throughout the region. For all those reasons, we ought to encourage the parties to reach agreement on the post referendum issues and relations as soon as is feasible. There is also a need to simultaneously help the protagonists in the Darfur conflict to finally reach an agreement within the context of the Doha talks that are set to resume in the next few days. On Somalia, it is Eritreas considered view, borne out by the bitter experience and spiralling violence of the past two decades, that there can be no military solution that conviction by now is widely shared in the international community, serious doubts continue to be raised as to whether the alternative — that is, a Somali-owned and Somali-driven, is possible and practicable. Eritrea does not by any means believe or suggest that that is easy or that it can lead to immediate results. It will undoubtedly be a complex and protracted process, but ultimately achievable. For, even in the past two turbulent decades, Somalis have more than once demonstrated that, given the right environment, they are capable of finding home-grown solutions to their problems. Eritrea therefore urges the United Nations and all those concerned with peace and stability in Somalia to earnestly engage all Somalis and to give the inclusive political process — in Somalia. While to the problem 36 stems from its political process the serious and sustained attention it deserves. I turn next to the matter of Eritrea and Ethiopia. While the United Nations grapples with the Sudan and Somalia, it continues to ignore the grave consequences of Ethiopias continued occupation of sovereign Eritrean territory, eight years after the ruling of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission and three years after the Commission ended its work by depositing with the United Nations the demarcation of the boundary between the two countries. Ethiopias illegal occupation and the United Nations silence, which mean the continuation of the conflict, are exacting a heavy price on the peoples of Eritrea and Ethiopia and are complicating the regional situation. I wish to remind the United Nations that Eritrea awaits responsible and urgent action to end Ethiopias violation of international law and its threat to regional peace and security. Eritreas constructive engagement on regional and international matters firm conviction that a conducive external environment is essential for nation-building. As Eritrea enters its twentieth year of independence, it remains focused on broad-based and people-centred political, economic, social and cultural development that will afford a life of dignity and prosperity to our people. After several years of consistent investments in health, education, agriculture and other essential infrastructure, we have created a solid basis for sustained economic growth. It is expected that trade and domestic and foreign investment will provide additional impetus for the growth of our economy. I wish to seize this opportunity to extend an invitation to all interested countries and their in development. "}}
