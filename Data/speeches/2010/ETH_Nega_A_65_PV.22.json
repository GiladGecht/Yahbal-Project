{"speech":{"0":" I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the opportunity to present my delegations response in exercising our right of reply to the statement made by the delegation of the State of Eritrea this morning. Before responding to the specific accusations made by the delegation of Eritrea, I would like to highlight some of the distinctly aggressive behaviour of the incumbent Government in Asmara. First, in the mid-1990s, the regime invaded eastern Sudan, under the cover of a rebel group that it organized, trained and armed against the Sudan, and it continues to meddle unabatedly in the internal affairs of that country, including in Darfur. Secondly, Eritrea invaded Yemens Hanish Islands in the Red Sea in 1995 and remained in occupation there for more than two years. Thirdly, the Eritrean regime attempted to invade the northern borders of Djibouti in 1997, but backed off due to international pressure. Eritrea nonetheless committed another round of aggression against Djibouti in 2008 and remained in occupation of those areas until 2010, when it was forced to vacate under pressure from the Security Council and a combined face-saving mediation by third parties. Fourthly, the regime unleashed unprovoked aggression against Ethiopia in May 1998 and occupied the northern borders of our country until its army was routed after facing a debacle at the hands of the Ethiopian defence forces in May 2000. The Eritrean Government is campaigning wildly against my country to conceal the truth, alleging that we were the aggressors and that Ethiopia continues to occupy sovereign Eritrean territory by refusing to implement the decisions of the arbitration Commission established by the two parties — whereas the truth, as ascertained Claims Eritrea-Ethiopia the by 45 legal is a Commission, is that it was Eritrea that violated Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter by invading the sovereign territory of Ethiopia. Ethiopia accepted the Boundary Commissions delimitation decision and has clearly indicated, time and again, that the demarcation on paper fiction. International law regarding border demarcation knows no such thing as demarcation on paper. Demarcation is the implementation of the delimitation decision on the ground; demarcation is placing boundary pillars on the ground. Ethiopia, beyond any reasonable doubt, has been willing to engage with Eritrea in demarcating the common border on the basis of the delimitation decision of the Commission. Ethiopia has always been ready to sit down and discuss with Eritrea in good faith the sectors where the delimitation has not been clear or where differences in understanding or interpretation exist. Until such time as this occurs, it is obvious that Ethiopia or Eritrea may be in control of each others territory. I would like to emphasize that Eritreas alleged claim that Ethiopia is occupying its territory is a figment of imagination. The Boundary the Algiers Commission had no mandate per Agreement two parties. By the same token, as in the case of the dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the United Nations has no power to enforce decisions of arbitration tribunals or to effect a transfer of territory or territorial sovereignty without a specific mandate given it by the parties. It is up to the parties to the Agreement to implement the decision of the Boundary Commission, that through demarcation. Ethiopia is and has always been ready to carry out the second half of the Algiers Agreement, namely, a demarcation-focused dialogue. It is Eritrea that has refused to engage in dialogue with Ethiopia on the demarcation of the border, by claiming ad nauseam the so-called occupation of sovereign Eritrean territory. Eritrea is trying to use this to divert attention from its destructive activities in the Horn of Africa by creating a pretext for further aggression. its statement of 27 November 2006 was to indicate on paper the coordinates that describe the boundary. The Commission, in paragraph 22 of its statement, made the Boundary Commission did is, delimitation on the ground its own to transfer territory between the All in following territory and consequently are under the significant point, which Eritrea conveniently ignores. It reads, and I quote: “Until such time as the boundary is finally demarcated, the Delimitation Decision of 13 April 2002 continues as the only valid legal description of the boundary” (, enclosure, para. 22). In the final analysis, the most important task that remains is to demarcate the boundary on the ground as per the delimitation decision, which would usher in a durable peace between the two parties. Mr. Salsabili (Islamic Republic of Iran): This afternoon, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates raised unacceptable claims about the three Iranian islands located in the Persian Gulf, namely, Abu Musa, Tonb-e Bozorg and Tonb-e Kuchak. The Islamic Republic of Iran categorically rejects those remarks as unacceptable claims against Iranian territorial integrity and emphasizes that the three said islands, located in the Persian Gulf, are eternal parts of Iranian its sovereignty. The Islamic Republic of Iran, while stressing its determination to continue its good-neighbourly and brotherly relations with the neighbouring United Arab Emirates, reiterates that all actions and measures taken by the Iranian authorities in those Iranian islands are fully based on the sovereign rights of the Islamic Republic of Iran and on the principle of its territorial integrity. The Islamic Republic of Iran stands ready to continue its bilateral talks with the relevant officials of the United Arab Emirates, with a view to removing any misunderstanding to implementation of the arrangements emanating from the documents exchanged in 1971 on Abu Musa island. Ms. Haile (Eritrea): I am taking the floor in exercise of the right of reply in connection with the statement just delivered by the representative of Ethiopia. The representative of Ethiopia made several unfounded accusations that contribute nothing to the peace and security of the region. My delegation categorically rejects all such accusations. Let me set the record straight. The Eritrea- Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC), established by Eritrea and Ethiopia pursuant to article 4, paragraph 2, of the Algiers Peace Agreement, has put to rest the border dispute between the two countries. Referring to the EEBCs twenty-sixth report (, annex II), the Secretary-General states that that may arise with regard 46 “the boundary between Ethiopia and Eritrea now automatically stands as demarcated by the boundary points (coordinates) listed in the annex to the Commissions Statement of 27 November 2006, and that [the Commission] considers this decision as binding on the parties. The Commission further asserted that it ‘has fulfilled its mandate”. (, para. 40) Therefore, the crux of the matter is Ethiopias continued occupation of sovereign Eritrean territory, in defiance of the ruling of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission. No campaigns of misinformation or the raising of irrelevant issues in this body will erase that fact. Ethiopia has to face up to its obligations if it is interested in the peace and stability of the region. There is no need to beat around the bush: had Ethiopia not reneged on its commitment and had cooperated fully with the independent Boundary Commission, the issue between the two countries could have been resolved then and there, and the successful conclusion of the Algiers Peace Agreement would have brought the huge suffering of the two peoples to an end in no time. The peaceful settlement of disputes is the core principle of the United Nations Charter. But Ethiopia has shown its disdain for international law and its lack of interest in the peaceful and legal resolution of disputes. The Algiers Peace Agreement provides for the the establishment of commissions have been and have completed their work. The third commission, with the authority to determine the origins of the conflict, has not yet been established. That task cannot be demanded of any other commission. Mr. Al-Yafei (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in Arabic): I thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the floor to comment on the remarks by the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran. My delegation expresses its regret at the repeated position of Iran, which has rejected the numerous peace initiatives my country has announced to resolve the conflict over the three occupied Emirates islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb through bilateral negotiations or the International Court of Justice to seek a legal opinion. We reiterate our rejection of Irans occupation and of all military and civilian measures it has taken on the islands with a view to changing their historical and three commissions. Two of through recourse established that The United Arab Emirates hopes demographic nature and imposing a fait accompli of occupation. We are disappointed that Iran has repeated its position calling for dealing with marginal issues pertaining to the outcome of the occupation of the islands, rather than dealing with the main issue of occupation itself. the international community will support its position, which calls upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to reconsider its policy of illegal occupation of the islands and to respond to our peace initiatives, which aim at reaching a comprehensive and just settlement to the issue of these islands in a manner that strengthens security, stability and economic cooperation among the countries of the region. Mr. Nunez Mosquera (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): I marvel at seeing how the Permanent Representative of Sweden, representative of a supposedly civilized and incorruptible country, assumes the right to judge other countries — always poor and underdeveloped countries of the South — on the issue of human rights. The Ambassador spoke, judged, handed down his verdict and abandoned the Hall. I asked him to stay to hear my reply, but he left. I ask myself with what right and moral authority he dares to judge and give opinions on no fewer than eight countries that are respectable and worthy Members of this Organization. Who told him that he could lecture Cubans on human rights, something about which we are deeply proud? As the entire international community is aware, Sweden is among the countries to have authorized illegal secret flights over its territory by the United States Central Intelligence Agency. That is a dark chapter in Swedens actions, which it has yet to clarify. When one asks a Swedish official about this, they say that the relevant investigations are being carried out. They have been investigating for several years. They are trying to cover up the issue, but peoples do not have such short memories. I could also refer to the situation of prostitution in Sweden and of the assaults, including sexual abuse, against women and girls in that country. But, in the interests of time, I shall not do so. I merely ask: When is its investigations on the illegal flights over its territory? When will the Swedish Government renounce double standards and political manipulation on such a noble the Swedish Government going to finish to 47 It was therefore shocking issue as human rights? How long will they try to continue to mislead the General Assembly? Mr. Tag-Eldin (Egypt): I take the floor in the exercise of the right of reply to respond to the false allegation made in the statement that was delivered by the representative of Sweden, which included baseless claims about the situation of the freedom of expression in my country, among other countries. The representative of Sweden should know better. He should know that Egypt has been in the lead of political reform in the Middle East. Freedom of expression is guaranteed, by our constitution and practice, to each and every Egyptian citizen. In Egypt, we have more than 300 newspapers and journals published daily, representing all views from every corner of Egyptian society and political life. the representative of Sweden refer to my country in this manner. We would like to advise the representative of Sweden to become better educated about Egypt and its comprehensive reforms aimed at ensuring a better life for Egyptian citizens and guaranteeing full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of expression. Egypt totally and flatly rejects such allegations. The representative of Sweden should know the difference between freedom of expression and insulting prophets and defaming religions in his country, before evaluating the situation of freedom of expression in other countries. Mr. Ren Yisheng (China) (spoke in Chinese): I would like to speak in exercise of the right of reply with the representative of Sweden. The Chinese Government has always protected the economic, social and cultural rights of its citizens, in keeping with the law. Our Government attaches equal to other categories of rights such as freedom of expression. Since the beginning of the reform process, the human statement made by importance to hear respect to the rights situation in China has greatly improved. This is something that is recognized by everybody; something that no one can deny. In the course of its history, Sweden has seen some dark incidents of human rights violations. Today it continues to violate the rights of minorities within its borders. One might say the human rights situation in Sweden is rather sombre. That country does not have the right to point fingers at others over human rights situations. Without mentioning the human rights situation in his own country, the representative of Sweden commented on human rights situations in other countries. This utterly twists the truth and is a clear example of double standards. The Chinese delegation categorically rejects the unfounded accusations made by the representative of Sweden. "}}
