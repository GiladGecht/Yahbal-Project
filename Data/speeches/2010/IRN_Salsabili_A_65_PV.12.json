{"speech":{"0":" This evening, the delegation of Belgium made baseless allegations against the peaceful Iranian nuclear programme by considering it as a threat to the international non-proliferation regime. In this regard and in exercise of right of reply, I should like to state the following. First, these allegations are without any foundation. Irans nuclear activities are and always have been for peaceful purposes, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly confirmed the peaceful nature of Irans nuclear programme. Secondly, according to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the development of peaceful nuclear energy is an inalienable right of every Member State, and my country is no exception in this regard. In exercising this right, Iran takes its responsibilities seriously. Our commitment to non-proliferation remains intact. And, finally, unwarranted focus on the peaceful, safeguarded nuclear facilities of the Islamic Republic of Iran, rather than addressing the existing proliferation threat posed by the secret, non-safeguarded nuclear- 53 weapon installations of the Zionist regime, is counterproductive and constitutes a dangerous distraction. We urge Belgium to refrain from turning a blind eye to that genuine proliferation threat and, in this context, to abandon its inconsistent approach to non-proliferation. Mr. Grauls (Belgium): I would like to remind the representative of Iran that Belgium, as a member of the European Union, fully adheres to the position repeatedly expressed by the European Union with regard to the Iranian nuclear issue"}}
