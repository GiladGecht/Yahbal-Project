{"speech":{"0":" I have two points to clarify in exercise of the right of reply. First, this morning the Prime Minister of the friendly State of Kuwait referred in his remarks to those Iranian islands located in the Persian Gulf. My delegation would like to make clear that there is no conflict whatsoever over those islands, as they are an eternal part of the Iranian territory and are under the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Therefore, we regret the use of inappropriate qualifications for these Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf. It goes without saying that the Islamic Republic of Iran continues to spare no efforts in strengthening its good-neighbourly and brotherly relations with all neighbouring countries, including the Persian Gulf littoral States. As a second point, my delegation would like to comment on the remarks of the Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, which was delivered this morning (see ). The United Kingdom delegate made bizarre comments on a part of the address made by the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the General Assembly yesterday (see ). President Ahmadinejad simply raised a number of questions concerning one of the main events of the past decade, which has affected all international relations and which has entailed wide consequences all over the world, including in my region. We would submit that such a hasty and weird reaction only indicates the increasing level of intolerance and disregard for the freedom of expression and opinion as values for which, ironically, he regards himself as the sole advocate. My delegation would like to assure the representative of the United Kingdom that the time has long passed when less than a handful of power centres dictated to world public opinion on how to think. I would also like to recall that the Islamic Republic of Iran was among the first nations that expressed a clear position that the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 constituted a cowardly and atrocious crime"}}
