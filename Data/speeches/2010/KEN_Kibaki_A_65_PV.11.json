{"speech":{"0":" The theme of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly, “Reaffirming the central in global governance”, timely. Todays transnational challenges, including issues of peace and security, development, human rights, the environment and health require genuine global governance that encompasses all United Nations Member States. In this regard, Kenya fully reaffirms the central role of the United Nations in global governance, consistent with its Charter and international law. It is, therefore, imperative that the ongoing United Nations reforms be accelerated in order to ensure that this institution of multilateral engagement is representative and transparent, is accountable to its 192 members and optimally achieves the aspirations of todays world. When I last addressed the General Assembly two years ago, I briefed this august body on the major steps taken by my country to resolve the political difficulties following our general elections in December 2007. Since then, we have made tremendous progress in implementing far-reaching reforms that will entrench democracy and secure our peace and stability. Top on the reform agenda has been the enactment of a new constitution, which was promulgated on 27 August 2010 following a successful national referendum. the improves structures of governance and lays a firm foundation for political stability and economic prosperity. It has created new vitality and a sense of renewal. We believe that this step will go a long way in contributing towards the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals. It is also our hope that this historic development The new Constitution greatly to 29 in the thirds of the pursuit of time allotted for Climate change continues in poverty reduction and education, will contribute to the continued consolidation of democratic governance in our region. Ten years ago, world leaders meeting here in New York committed themselves to pursue the Millennium Development Goals in response to the worlds main development challenges of poverty, ignorance and ill- health. Two the attainment of these Goals has lapsed. With only five years left to the targeted year 2015, the urgency of bridging the remaining gap is a reality we must now confront. As I indicated in my statement to this Assembly invested significant three years ago, Kenya has resources the Millennium Development Goals. We have recorded substantial progress in reducing maternal and child mortality, in the fight against HIAIDS and malaria, and in promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women. to hamper our development aspirations. this challenge, my country has taken major steps to enhance as reclaiming and protecting our five major water towers; undertaking investments in wind, solar and geothermal energy; and making comprehensive commitments to green our economy. Despite these efforts, Kenya is facing many negative consequences of climate change. Our crop- and livestock-based agriculture, on which the vast majority of Kenyans depend, is now at the mercy of unpredictable weather patterns. It is with a deep concern, therefore, that we note the international communitys inability to make headway in the critical negotiations on climate change. It is Kenyas hope that the world will recognize the urgency of concluding these negotiations in the interest of the survival of humanity. I look forward to positive outcomes from the upcoming meetings on climate change in Mexico and South Africa. I now wish to turn to one of the major obstacles to the pursuit of peace and development, including the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals, in our subregion, namely, the continuing political instability in Somalia that is festering beyond that country. recognition of environmental sustainability, such In the the to of from the insecurity this year, In July of todays Somalia threat posed by to deteriorate and the support needed these decisions by in Somalia. Today, as Since the early 1990s, Kenya has borne the full weight of this Assembly meets, the security situation in Somalia continues threaten peace and stability across the entire region and beyond. Needless to say, to international peace and security is greater than that of any other conflict in the region. Yet Somalia continues to suffer benign neglect international community, leading to many lost opportunities to resolve the crisis. The perceived reluctance of the Security Council to engage with Somalia has been a matter of great concern for those of us who suffer the worst consequences of the conflict. Today, I wish to draw the attention of this Assembly to yet another opportunity that should not be lost. the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) Summit identified critical elements of engagement and took a number of decisions on the way forward. These decisions were endorsed by the African Union summit in Kampala in July 2010. Unfortunately, to implement international community has not been forthcoming. It is against this background that Kenya urges the United Nations and the entire international community to seize the opportunity created by the African regional initiative and lend support to the proposed measures, which include the appointment of an eminent high- level personality for Somalia, the effective deployment of the proposed 2,000 troops, a review of the current mandate of the African Union Mission in Somalia to enhance the extension of support the Transitional Federal Government to bolster its effectiveness countrywide. As the Chair of the IGAD Committee on the Sudan, I have remained actively engaged with the implementation Peace Agreement (CPA). I have done so because we in the IGAD region believe that the CPA holds the key to peace and stability in the Sudan and the region. I wish to inform this Assembly that I have received assurances from both President Omer Al-Bashir and First Vice-President Salva Kiir to remain on course with respect to the preparations for the referendum. I am pleased the Assembly that both reaffirmed their commitment to resolve all the its peace enforcement capacity, and the Comprehensive the outstanding to further issues, to hold inform 30 referendum on 9 January 2011, and to accept the outcome of the vote. We in the region are looking forward to the holding of a successful and peaceful referendum that promotes regional peace and stability. These efforts by the neighbours of the Sudan and the African Union have created a momentum that is critical to the full implementation of the CPA. It is crucial that the world stand in support of these initiatives as Sudan takes vital steps in relation to its future governance. I believe that continued engagement with the leadership of both the National Congress Party and the Sudan Peoples Liberation Movement is the only way towards the peaceful resolution of the challenges facing the Sudan. In view of this perspective, I wish to inform this Assembly that I will convene the second IGAD Special Summit on the Sudan in November 2010, in order to take stock of progress, ensure the process remains on course and support efforts relating the post- referendum arrangements. In conclusion, I wish to express my hope that through our unity, and commitment, the challenges facing the international community will be overcome. Let us rise to the occasion and demonstrate our political will and ability to work together for the good of all humankind. "}}
