{"speech":{"0":" I am honoured to address this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly on behalf of the people of Liberia. I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to lead this Assembly and am convinced that you will bring to the office your wealth of experience as a former President and Foreign Minister of the Swiss Confederation. Let me express appreciation to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, for the capable manner in which he conducted the affairs of the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Allow me also to extend highest commendation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his unwavering commitment to the Organization and his efficient management of its affairs.

(E) *1054965* the agenda of formally placed on force, have stabilized development effort and thereby have attracted some $16 billion in private investment in the reactivation of our mining, agriculture and forestry sectors. In addition, a new potential was recently discovered in oil exploration. The results of reform in our security sector, enhanced by the continued deployment of the United Nations peacekeeping the security situation in the country, where people move freely around. Experience in this regard shows that peacekeeping and peacebuilding can and should take place concurrently, and we are pleased that Liberia is now the Peacebuilding Commission to enable us to chart the way for a smooth transition from peacekeeping and peacebuilding to recovery. Moreover, we have encouraged a vibrant environment in which people have exercised their inalienable rights to free expression, association, religion and access to the press without hindrance. Nobody has been molested on account of views expressed. Liberia has no prisoners of conscience in detention, nor does anyone have cause to flee in fear for their life or safety on account of their political beliefs or association. Thus, in promoting a liberal environment in which freedom, equity and equality are exercised as the best guarantees of peace, security and stability, we can boast of being counted among the Governments that have demonstrated commitment to good governance and proven respect for human rights. Regionally, Liberia continues to demonstrate its commitment peaceful coexistence and respect for the sovereign integrity of other nations. We actively participate in subregional and regional affairs through the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States, the Community of Sahel-Saharan States, and the Mano River Union. The Mano River Union is currently under Liberias chairmanship, and this has allowed us to stay engaged with our members, Guinea and Cote dIvoire, as they embark upon their political transitions. We hail the recent breakthrough by President Barack Obama in bringing the Palestinians and Israelis back to the negotiating table and holding their leaders to their words to fulfil their promise to remain engaged and conduct direct talks aimed at ending that long- running crisis. good-neighbourliness, to Because we live in a global village, a continued crisis in any Member State or region should warrant our concern. Moreover, an unending crisis contradicts the cardinal objective of the United Nations, which is the promotion of international peace and security. In that regard, we suggest that the situation in Somalia warrants a Chapter VII intervention. In a country that has gone many years without a stable constitutional Government, the presence of pirates, extremists and other terrorist elements there should sound the alarm. The world needs to act promptly, as we cannot afford to see Somalia remain a haven for anarchists and extremists. That is why our Government supports the role of the African Union in fielding troops in Somalia. We call for more troop deployment from other countries, and we strongly support action to put an end to the Somali quagmire. We also call on the Somalis themselves to accept dialogue and go to the negotiating table to thrash out their differences and restore their country to rightful peace and dignity. While we acknowledge the right of States to self-defence and the promotion of programmes in support of national interests, we call on them to do so responsibly, with the respect for protocols such developments. At this weeks Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) summit, we reaffirmed Liberias commitment to continuing to work for the achievement of all eight Goals, although we are implementing those Goals under a more challenging context. Our national development agenda and programmes for ensuring national reconciliation, good governance and the rule of law, national security, food security, and the implementation of our poverty reduction strategy are consistent with the objectives of the MDGs. Our progress bears the fruits of this commitment. We are pleased to note the progress the world has made in the advancement of women. Today, there is greater representation of women in Government, in political life, business and civil society. Liberias own effort was recognized on Sunday when we received an award the empowerment of women. We also commend this body and in establishing the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, and we international public opinion and and for our progress on MDG 3, on the Secretary-General their work conventions surrounding for 2 applaud the appointment of the former President of Chile, Michelle Bachelet, to take on this responsibility. We have five years left to go to achieve the MDGs. For us, it is not the target date that matters; rather, it is the commitment to achieving the Goals that is important. We therefore call upon our partner countries to support the realization of the Goals through strong global partnership, as recommended in MDG 8. We believe in the partnerships we have enjoyed with the bilateral and multilateral institutions that have made our progress possible. We call upon all in this Hall to secure the strength of this partnership, which benefits all of our countries, by supporting the replenishment of the resources of the World Bank and the African Development Bank. Liberias progress is not without challenges. The satisfactory security environment of which I speak is still fragile, and made more so by the political uncertainties in our subregion. We also continue to face the tensions associated with the thousands of our young people who, lacking skills, are still unemployed. Moreover, we continue raised expectations expressed in the demand from villages and communities across the country for essential infrastructure such as roads, schools and clinics. Perhaps the greatest challenge we face is to go beyond the measures we have taken in formulating a public service code of conduct, introducing new procurement and financial management systems, and in establishing of integrity â€” all aimed at addressing long-standing corruption. Reform of the judicial system and efforts to change an inherited value system are additional measures that are under way. Another challenge is Liberias vulnerability to organized cross-border crime, including drug and human trafficking, as the result of porous borders and limited law-enforcement capacity, with weak national security organizations. Against this background, we recently the Freetown Commitment on Combating and Transnational Organized Crime in West Africa, which should assist us in promoting capacity-building in the region to combat transnational crime. The root cause of civil crisis in Liberia was the consistent failure of democratic transitions that would usher in Governments elected by the people. With the support of the United Nations, multiparty democratic Illicit Trafficking strengthening of Drugs to manage the signed in and the pillars elections were held in 2005, following the end of the civil crisis. In keeping with our Constitution, the Liberian people will once again exercise the right of choice when we hold elections in 2011. The 2011 elections will mark a groundbreaking turning point. They will complete Liberias transition to full constitutional rule and participatory democracy. This will be the true test of Liberias progress on the road to development and its defining moment, which, if successful, will serve as proof that we can truly stay on an irreversible course towards peace and development. It is absolutely essential that everything be done to ensure a peaceful, legitimate and transparent process. I wish to state categorically that my Government is completely and fully committed to this objective, and we call on the international community to stay with Liberia on this last stretch. Already, the process leading to the holding of elections in 2011 has begun with the release of the election timetable. As a founding Member of this Organization, Liberia remains inspired by the noble objectives of the United Nations in meeting enormous global challenges. We believe in its ability to formulate and implement programmes, particularly those aimed at raising the standard of living of people, forging global cooperation and solidarity, and encouraging dialogue to reduce tension and conflicts. In closing, we say again that Liberia is on the way to recovery. We have thrown off the label of a pariah State. We have restored hope to our people, credibility and honour to our national integrity, and won international creditworthiness and respect. Our confidence in the future of our country is firm. Our new vision of a rising Liberia seeks to move us to a middle-income country by the year 2030. This is an aggressive goal, but we are determined, and through efficiency in the allocation and use of our natural resources, we will succeed. We thank you, Sir, and all the members of this noble institution for the support that has brought Liberia to this point of progress. "}}
