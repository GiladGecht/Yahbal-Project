{"speech":{"0":" At this mornings meeting we heard the representative of the Netherlands express in his statement the refusal of his Government to accept that the President of my country, the Sudan, be permitted to travel to his country. He said that: I now give the floor to the representative of the “it is unacceptable to the Dutch Government that someone like President Al-Bashir of the Sudan, against whom an arrest warrant is outstanding, should be allowed to move freely in a country that is an ICC partner”. () I would like to tell the representative of the Netherlands that we are surprised by such a statement, which demonstrates an ignorance of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, because my country, the Sudan, is not a signatory of that Statute. It also shows a blatant ignorance of a principle of international law known even to junior law students — I repeat, junior students of the law. I am referring to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which stipulates that a State that is not a party to a treaty is not bound by that treatys provisions. I wish to call attention in the same context to a resolution issued by the African Union following the visit of the President of the Republic of the Sudan to Kenya and Chad and its affirmation of the commitment of all States members of the African Union to the decisions of the African Union in this matter. That statement expressed appreciation of the courageous stands of Kenya and Chad and their commitment to the decisions of the African Union. Furthermore, we tell the representative of the Netherlands that what he has said is unacceptable. It is an audacious interference in the internal affairs of our country, because it is the right of any country to host whomever it wants to host. However, it seems that some countries are still moved by memories of past colonialism, the same heinous colonialism whereby such countries usurped the freedom and wealth of other nations and peoples"}}
