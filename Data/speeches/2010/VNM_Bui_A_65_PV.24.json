{"speech":{"0":" Thank you, Mr. President, for allowing us to speak very briefly. And let me apologize to all the other representatives for requesting to speak at this late hour. We want to speak in response to the statement made by Sweden about the so-called jailing and harassment of journalists in Viet Nam. We believe that no country is perfect and Viet Nam is no exception. Therefore, we have established and constantly improved the legal system of a State governed by laws after many decades of ravaging and destructive wars. At the same time, we are open to all comments as far as my country is concerned, provided that such comments are constructive and well-informed. We have engaged in dialogue with many interested countries, including, for example, the United States of America, Australia and Canada, to name a few, as well as the European Union. In that context, we regret that Sweden has made uninformed, misinformed and ungrounded comments about the so-called jailing and harassment of journalists in some countries, including Viet Nam, which are contrary to the tradition of friendship between the two countries on the basis of mutual respect and respect for international law, and has allowed itself the right to judge the situation in other countries without any basis or grounds.
