{"speech":{"0":" I have asked for the floor to exercise my delegations right of reply to the statement made by the Azerbaijani Foreign Minister this morning (see ). The references in that statement to Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh can be attributed only to the imagination of the speaker, who still presumes that cold war-style propaganda and repeated anti-Armenian statements at the United Nations can be an effective tool for strengthening his countrys position the co-chairs of for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group to find a comprehensive — I repeat, a comprehensive — and peaceful settlement to the Nagorno Karabakh issue, and not the step-by-step solution referred to by the Azerbaijani Foreign Minister. That statement revealed that the Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan, while preaching to international law, has apparently taken it upon himself to rather, misinterpret — the United Nations Charter and statements made by the Armenian President and the Minsk Group co-chairs on the field assessment mission to the territories surrounding Nagorno Karabakh. It is regrettable that Azerbaijan is once again misusing and misinterpreting the field assessment mission report, as it did in 2005, to justify its militaristic rhetoric and move the discussions on the formats. Nagorno Karabakh Azerbaijans own report interpretation of in the ongoing efforts of conflict to other the Organization single-handedly the adherence interpret — or 12 but, more importantly, the contrary, the explanations and recommendations contradicts presented earlier by the Minsk Group co-chairs. The accusations contained in the statement by the Azerbaijani Foreign Minister are not only baseless and counterproductive they endanger the negotiation process. First of all, none of the four Security Council resolutions on Nagorno Karabakh contains a single word on the so-called Armenian aggression. On it was Azerbaijan that first launched a large-scale armed offensive against the civilian population of Nagorno Karabakh in response to the peaceful and constitutional expression of the will of its people to exercise their right to self-determination. Secondly, the aforementioned resolutions do not contain a word about the withdrawal of Armenian military forces from Nagorno Karabakh. That is simply because they have never been there. Thirdly, the defence army of Nagorno Karabkh controls only 8.5 per cent of Azerbaijani territory, which serves as a security buffer zone, as opposed to the 20 per cent quoted in the statement of Azerbaijan. Moreover, Azerbaijan itself controls 15 per cent of the territory of Nagorno Karabakh. Finally, the Azerbaijani Foreign Minister claims that there are 1 million refugees in the country — a figure that does not correspond to any official data provided organizations. Such exaggerations and distortions of facts and figures undermine the work of the United Nations and other international forums, artificially delaying constructive steps to meet the needs and alleviate the suffering of the people of Nagorno Karabakh. Even if Azerbaijan is misleading its own peoples public opinion by distorting facts, it cannot do so to the international community. Armenia has always supported the settlement of the conflict between Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh through the exclusive use of peaceful means, and has repeatedly proven that in practice. Armenia has given a clear answer to the latest version of the basic principles proposed by the three co-Chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group as a basis for negotiation of the settlement. If Azerbaijan is willing to agree unequivocally to it, it will be possible to see progress in the settlement process. international by has been responsibility in Azerbaijan that bears primary Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): I would like to exercise the right of reply to the remarks made by the representative of Armenia. Those remarks represent yet another piece of evidence that testifies to Armenias apparent disregard of its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and international law, and also demonstrate how far that Member State is from being engaged in a constructive search for peace in the region. It is curious that the delegation of Armenia — the country for unleashing the war of aggression against Azerbaijan, carrying out ethnic cleansing on a massive scale, committing other heinous crimes during the conflict, and advocating an undisguised racist ideology — should attempt to criticize my country and lecture it on issues pertaining to such notions as peace, human rights, negotiations and conflict resolution. The delegation of Armenia must be well aware that what it considers to be the exercise of the right to self-determination by the Armenian ethnic minority living unequivocally characterized by the Security Council and the General Assembly, authoritative international organizations, as the illegal use of force against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, and other egregious violations of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. The illegality of the separatist entity and its structures established by Armenia on the occupied territory of Azerbaijan has been repeatedly pointed out at the international level in the most unambiguous manner. The Government of Armenia, which has purged both the territory of its own country and the occupied areas of Azerbaijan of non-Armenians, and has thus succeeded in creating a mono-ethnic culture there, should be the last to advocate the unilateral secession of ethnic minority groups from sovereign States. The remarks of the delegation of Armenia have not deviated speculations and misinterpretations as to the true value and content of the conflict settlement process and mediation efforts. Intensified attacks over the past month on Azerbaijani civilians and civilian objects across the front line, and an unprecedented increase in hostile statements by the Armenian leadership — full of historical falsifications and factual distortions concerning the root causes of the war and the conflict settlement process — have as by other as well from the usual 13 confirmed the validity of our serious concerns about the destabilizing effect of Armenias policy, and represent a direct threat to peace, security and stability in the region. We are confident that Armenias destructive political agenda is fated never to be realized. Armenia will be obliged to cease its provocative policy, to ensure that its occupation of Azerbaijani territory is territorial ended, claims on its neighbouring nations, and to establish civilized relations with all countries of the region. Azerbaijan sincerely believes that there is no alternative to peace, stability and mutually beneficial regional cooperation. "}}
