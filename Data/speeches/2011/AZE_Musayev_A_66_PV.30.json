{"speech":{"0":" I would like to exercise the right of reply to the remarks made by the representative of Armenia. Those remarks represent yet another piece of evidence that testifies to Armenias apparent disregard of its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and international law, and also demonstrate how far that Member State is from being engaged in a constructive search for peace in the region. It is curious that the delegation of Armenia — the country for unleashing the war of aggression against Azerbaijan, carrying out ethnic cleansing on a massive scale, committing other heinous crimes during the conflict, and advocating an undisguised racist ideology — should attempt to criticize my country and lecture it on issues pertaining to such notions as peace, human rights, negotiations and conflict resolution. The delegation of Armenia must be well aware that what it considers to be the exercise of the right to self-determination by the Armenian ethnic minority living unequivocally characterized by the Security Council and the General Assembly, authoritative international organizations, as the illegal use of force against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, and other egregious violations of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. The illegality of the separatist entity and its structures established by Armenia on the occupied territory of Azerbaijan has been repeatedly pointed out at the international level in the most unambiguous manner. The Government of Armenia, which has purged both the territory of its own country and the occupied areas of Azerbaijan of non-Armenians, and has thus succeeded in creating a mono-ethnic culture there, should be the last to advocate the unilateral secession of ethnic minority groups from sovereign States. The remarks of the delegation of Armenia have not deviated speculations and misinterpretations as to the true value and content of the conflict settlement process and mediation efforts. Intensified attacks over the past month on Azerbaijani civilians and civilian objects across the front line, and an unprecedented increase in hostile statements by the Armenian leadership — full of historical falsifications and factual distortions concerning the root causes of the war and the conflict settlement process — have as by other as well from the usual 13 confirmed the validity of our serious concerns about the destabilizing effect of Armenias policy, and represent a direct threat to peace, security and stability in the region. We are confident that Armenias destructive political agenda is fated never to be realized. Armenia will be obliged to cease its provocative policy, to ensure that its occupation of Azerbaijani territory is territorial ended, claims on its neighbouring nations, and to establish civilized relations with all countries of the region. Azerbaijan sincerely believes that there is no alternative to peace, stability and mutually beneficial regional cooperation. "}}
