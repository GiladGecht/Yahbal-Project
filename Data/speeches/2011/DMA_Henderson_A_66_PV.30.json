{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of my delegation and the Government and the people of the Commonwealth of Dominica, to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, and to assure him of our full cooperation. We are confident that with his skills and experience, he will bring leadership the extensive and important agenda of this sixty-sixth session. I also extend a special welcome to the newest member of this Assembly, the Republic of South Sudan, which became the 193rd Member of the United Nations in July. to convey Dominicas to Mr. Al-Nassers predecessor, His appreciation Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, for having so ably guided the proceedings of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We also express our gratitude for the continued efforts of His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-Moon and for his leadership at this most challenging time. This meeting is being convened at a time of tremendous global insecurity. Never in the history of humankind have we had to struggle for our own existence as we have done in this past decade. We are still faced with unstable global financial markets, issues of food availability and affordability, increasing unrest in some regions and the high cost of energy, and we seem set to endure the mounting consequences of Mother Earths response to decades of global warming. the Caribbean Sea, are again in hurricane season, a period like Dominica, I would also it addresses Countries located like in 3 in that we of high vulnerability the Caribbean experience for a period of four to six months each year. Fresh in our minds are the recent unfortunate events that took place in the eastern United States. For the first time in its recorded history, the city in which we are convened came to a complete standstill because of Hurricane Irene in late August. We in the Caribbean understand clearly the challenges faced in the aftermath of hurricanes, as these are the kinds of disasters that small island States such as Dominica are forced to routinely schedule on our calendar of events and brace for every six months. For us, each years recovery efforts could become next years destruction point. On behalf of my delegation, I extend my condolences to and empathize with all those who were affected by Hurricane Irene. For reasons such as these, each year we come before this Assembly to report on the deterioration not only of the environment, but also of climate change negotiations. With full knowledge that these impacts are projected to increase over time, we believe that we can build on a number of outcomes agreed to in Cancun. We also believe that although some responses might not meet every Member States expectation, they could act as catalysts and springboards for new approaches and new solutions in Durban. As witnesses to environmental degradation at a time when reliance on the ecosystem to provide energy for basic needs continues to intensify, we as a people cannot continue to ignore the subject of climate change. We believe that climate change is an energy- related the provision of reliable, accessible and affordable energy and its by-products are critical the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Despite unfulfilled promises and a slow start to fast-start funding, we must report on actions advanced since Cancun that have helped position the small island developing States (SIDS) to transform their energy sectors. Specifically, I refer to the SIDS Sustainable Energy Initiative, also known as SIDS DOCK. Almost 30 SIDS have signed an agreement to establish this initiative, created by the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) under the chairmanship of Grenada and in partnership with the Government of Denmark, the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank. We wish to thank the Government of Denmark for its significant financial contribution to to sustainable development and issue and that the to address operationalizing this facility and for the leadership that it has given and continues to give to the process. My delegation expresses its gratitude to the other members of AOSIS for staying the course and reaffirms Dominicas commitment to the initiative. SIDS DOCK was the outstanding outcome for SIDS at Cancun, and, as we set our sights on Durban, the expectation is that other partners will support the initiative, which is set to transform the energy sector in SIDS. It is our hope that sufficient progress will be made in negotiating appropriate measures that might be implemented losses and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including impacts related to extreme weather as well as slow-onset events. These two initiatives are within the framework of the Bali Road Map and Action Plan and reflect actions that are geared towards the fulfilment of commitments and giving effect to the Cancun decisions. It is no secret that the Kyoto Protocol is in serious trouble. While it represents less than 30 per cent of greenhouse-gas emissions, it remains the only legally binding global agreement in our quest to address the growing threat of climate change. In order to build on the gains made under the first commitment period, we must ensure that the broad principles secured in the Kyoto Protocol are maintained in any legally binding global agreement at Durban. A sustainable energy sector is the foundation for sustainable development in small island States such as Dominica. For the past decade, Dominica has been working towards the development of our geothermal potential, with the assistance of international agencies and development partners. the European Union, the Government of France and the Regional Councils of Guadeloupe and Martinique, we are now closer the realization of our goal. Preparation for drilling has begun, and the three test wells will be complete by the end of 2011. The development of our geothermal potential will provide us with the capacity to meet our domestic needs and supply electricity to our neighbouring islands, especially the French territories of Guadeloupe and Martinique, through our connection via submarine cables. With this displacement of hundreds of megawatts of fossil-generated power, coupled with our the support and contribution of With to 4 impeding initiatives. renewable-energy sustainable development practices, Dominicas target is to be not only carbon-neutral but also carbon-negative by the year 2020. Like Dominica, many SIDS are pursuing their own However, unsustainable debt burdens and lack of technology have made such initiatives almost impossible for some SIDS. We invite other developed countries and international institutions to join the Government of Denmark in SIDS DOCK and the Government of Norway in its “Energy for all” initiative, by providing the critical support that SIDS so desperately need. We in the SIDS are committed to playing our part; suffice it to say, however, that there are still some major obstacles the pace of progress, particularly financing for SIDS-appropriate technology and transfer. As part of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) process, Dominica calls on the Secretary-General to establish a special SIDS-appropriate technology fund to address the issue of innovative financing for sustainable energy technology transfer and development for small island States. In that regard, we also ask that the Secretary- General consider appointing a goodwill ambassador tasked with advocating on behalf of SIDS and helping the Secretary-General in supporting the Fund. The effective transfer and development of SIDS-appropriate technology is essential for SIDS to build resilience to the present and future impacts of climate change. In addition to looking forward to securing a renewed sustainable development at Rio+20, the SIDS expect that the international community will reaffirm their support with the new and additional resources required to implement the programmes and activities agreed to, from Agenda 21 to the Barbados Programme of Action and further implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action. renewed commitments and agreements reached at Rio+20 must address the major impediments to implementing these summit outcomes, including the limited technical, financial and human resources, as well as the impact of exogenous factors, particularly the global financial crisis. There is no denying the importance of national security the unregulated, non-standardized and highly dangerous trade in arms and ammunition poses great threats to law and order in the Mauritius Strategy commitment political Any to a society; thus for for the to trade region Negotiations on an arms its most productive members is not a our societies. The Caribbean manufacturer of arms or ammunition, yet large quantities of illegal firearms and ammunition often associated with the illegal drug trade are transferred across our borders, infiltrating our society and causing mayhem and death, overburdening our health-care system and contributing to the destabilization of economic progress and well-being. The region has lost some of this unregulated transfer of arms. This is an unsustainable situation for any country, but even more so for small island States. treaty are welcome, and, as stated in the Caribbean Community Declaration on Small Arms and Light Weapons, Dominica is committed to full and active participation in all efforts related to the issue of small arms. Of particular importance is the 2012 review of the 2001 Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, as well as the 2012 United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty. In the absence of these and other initiatives to help combat global insecurity, threats to global peace and security will continue to multiply in both intensity and form. Multilateralism must take centre stage in the struggle to deal with these challenges. The work of the United Nations is therefore paramount in maintaining world peace and security. In its maintenance of this role, the United Nations must be able to clearly demonstrate legitimacy and fairness in its actions, cognizant always of the need to protect the most vulnerable. The ability of the Security Council to adequately respond to new and changing world dynamics rests with its acceptance of the need for continuous reform to adapt to the times, including a recognition of the increase in size of the United Nations membership and global economic power shifts. Reform reflects more than representation and, in this situation, should promote adaptation to the needs of Members and the drafting of strategies that would contribute to ending wars and halting disputes. In that regard, we welcome Mr. Al-Nassers proposal of “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means” as the theme for the high- level debate at the opening of this session of the General Assembly. 5 the to discontinue the earthquake that devastated for sovereignty and living. The paralysis of Earlier I spoke of the threats which plague mankind in this era of globalization. I also highlighted the need for multilateralism and for cooperation between and among States. These challenges can be overcome only in a global environment where there exists respect for one anothers territorial integrity, non-interference in one anothers domestic affairs, respect right of self- determination. It is in this context that we again call on the United States of America its economic blockade against the people of the Republic of Cuba. I also welcome the support of the President of the Assembly in keeping our sister island of Haiti on the global stage. There are few words left to describe the dire misery in which our brothers and sisters in Haiti are reconstruction and development activities has been the hallmark of the aftermath of that country in January 2010. We recognize the tremendous challenges to the those reconstruction efforts and wish countries, individuals who have contributed and continue to contribute towards this process. We again call on those who have made pledges to make good on their commitments in order to accelerate the reconstruction efforts. The presence of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) remains critical to the reconstruction efforts by providing security and support to the people of Haiti. We therefore urge the Security Council to extend the tenure of MINUSTAH to facilitate the efforts of the new Administration of His Excellency President Michel Martelly. We all accept that it is critical to collectively address the impact of climate change, to resolve conflicts throughout the world and to enhance peace and security for humanity. All these efforts, however, will be of little value to our peoples if we are not able to ensure that they are healthy. The United Nations has shown exemplary leadership in dealing with the fight against HIAIDS, together with its partners. This same leadership must now be given to the fight against non-communicable diseases. The frightening statistics of 2008 issued by the that World Health Organization, which estimated to 36 million due non-communicable diseases (NCDs), suggests that this deaths worldwide were institutions and thank to to to issued diseases include education; the world. The severe continue phenomenon is not unique to any one region and therefore cannot be downplayed. NCDs pose one of the greatest challenges to the health and development of Dominica, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and impacts of the rest of non-communicable place tremendous pressures on our health-care systems, productivity and already overburdened and struggling economies. It was for these reasons that the CARICOM Heads of Government the Port of Spain Declaration in 2007 to promote healthy lifestyles and to combat NCDs in our region. Prior to and since the declaration, the Dominican Government has adopted a national policy on NCDs. We have further implemented a number of measures as part of our multisectoral efforts the strengthening of our primary health-care system with the contribution of our partners, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the Republic of Cuba; the promotion of healthy lifestyles; greater access to treatment and free health care; and appropriate legislative and policy changes. The Government of Dominica endorses the Caribbean Community in this regard. We remain committed to the well-being of every citizen. We join our CARICOM colleagues in thanking the United Nations Member States and Secretariat for convening the successful High-level Meeting on NCDs. We look forward to the implementation of the Political Declaration (resolution ) and call on the developed countries to partner with us in our various efforts to combat NCDs. its confidence in the United Nations system as the ultimate negotiating and deliberating body for addressing major challenges confronting the world. The Assembly can count on Dominicas commitment to working in close collaboration with the United Nations agencies and respective Member States to strengthen the mission of this body. We cannot overemphasize the fact that, notwithstanding its many limitations and imperfections, the United Nations system is critical to maintaining world peace and security and an international humanitarian system. The world today is a much better place because of the United Nations. Finally, Dominica wishes leadership taken by reaffirm the to 6 The current world economic and "}}
