{"speech":{"0":" Allow me first to convey to the President my warmest congratulations on his election to guide the work of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I have no doubt that under his leadership, Qatar will be instrumental in the service of his presidency, and, indeed, in that of the Assembly as a whole, as we face the challenging times ahead. I also recognize the service of his predecessor and wish to record our appreciation for that service. To our Secretary-General, delegations congratulations on the renewal of his mandate, an act that bears testimony to the confidence placed in him by the Member States of this body. This is the last time that I will address this great Hall as President of my country. Before the end of the year, I will be proud to be the first President of Guyana to demit office under the constitutional term limits that I signed into law in the early days of my presidency. Inevitably, that milestone has caused me to look back on the changes that have taken place in this body since I first stood here 12 years ago. Three things strike me offer my I 15 as I reflect on the role of the United Nations over those 12 years. The first is that the central point that I and others have repeatedly made from this rostrum stays as true today as it was when we first articulated it. The core point is that, while the values that inform the work of the United Nations and our Member States — the values of peace, equality and justice — are timeless, they are of limited use unless we, as the United Nations and as individual Member States, draw on them to catalyse consistent, meaningful and practical responses to the contemporary changing challenges that our peoples face. The second point that strikes me is how utterly different todays contemporary challenges actually are when compared with those of just 12 years ago, not to mention those of the 1940s, when the United Nations was founded. The rise of China, India, Brazil and other developing countries is transforming the globe for the better. Billions of people have been lifted out of poverty; new businesses are generating millions of jobs, growth and capital; and there is once again genuine intellectual debate about the right way to embed rights and justice at the core of the global governance structure. However, the emergence of those great Powers is happening in a totally different way to how Powers emerged in the past. They are emerging in a world that instant communications is through capabilities and globalized trading and financial systems. What we are witnessing is unlike anything that has happened before, and few communities and no country on the planet are not impacted, almost in real time, by those changes as they happen. That presents the United Nations and its Member States with a great opportunity to realize our values and to secure the global peace, justice and security to which we aspire. But to do so, we must face up to the opportunities of interconnectedness with responses that are international collective action in recent years is not good. That leads me to my third point, which is that the search for justice and the achievement of rights for all require us to broaden our traditional understanding of security. We must struggle to achieve rights in a new way and, as many have said before me, alongside the physical security challenge, there are many other aspects to human security and the realization of rights. interconnected. Our interconnected record on that I think that there are four other elements of security, in particular, that we need to properly understand. First is the challenge of food security. We are heading for 8 billion, then 9 billion people. Rising prosperity means those people want greater amounts of, and more nutritious, food. By current trends, we need 100 million hectares of new land by 2020 to meet that demand. How do we do that and avoid excessive price increases and volatility? Second is the challenge of energy security. As the world gets richer, our demand for energy increases massively. We are likely to demand 36 per cent more energy by 2035. How do we generate the energy needed to meet such demand in a way that helps people everywhere to develop and does not choke off economic growth through high prices caused by energy scarcity? Third is the challenge of resource security. If we are to alleviate poverty, countries need to develop. And if countries are to develop, they need minerals and other commodities. China alone accounts for more than a third of the demand for many of the most important global commodities, and countries across the world, most notably in South America and Africa, can supply them. How do we help global development by sourcing such minerals and using them efficiently and justly? Fourth is the challenge of climate security. If we are the biggest economic and social to avert catastrophe ever seen, we must stabilize our planets climate. At the absolute limit, that means stabilizing global temperatures at a maximum of two degrees above pre-industrial levels. Yet we are on track towards perhaps a four- or five-degree rise, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. The disaster that is beyond anyones comprehension. And the fact that we are not treating it as an emergency will be viewed by history as the biggest derogation of responsibility by societies and Governments to ever take place. How can we rapidly change that situation before we run out of time? both represent opportunities and difficulties. The difficulties are obvious, but they are opportunities in the sense that we have enough land, innovation and human ingenuity to feed the world. We have enough clean energy potential to power future prosperity. We have enough resources to provide the foundations for economic growth. We know that to avert climate change means using fossil this could challenges represent Those four 16 fuels and land in the right way. Once we start realizing those opportunities, we can create new platforms for peace, development and physical security. That sounds an impossible task, but I would argue that it is not. There are solutions to enable those opportunities to be grasped today, and the United Nations can provide the platform for making the changes that are needed. We can do that if we draw motivation from the realization that the idea of integrated sustainable development, where we optimize our response to the interlinked security challenges, is not some abstraction for environmentalists. It is not a piece of rhetoric about a theoretical better future. Instead, it is an essential and specific call to action that has the potential to be the key global breakthrough of our time. It can change the global paradigm of development in a way that enables us to address the interconnected security challenges we face in the world today. Pursuing this integrated response to our global challenges presents unparalleled opportunities for peoples across todays developing world. The food we need, the energy we generate, the minerals and other commodities from which we grow our economies, along with our forests and other land that can be the drivers of climate solutions, are all largely in the developing world. With the right international action, the developing world can lead the globe in the creation of the transformational shift we need to see. the United Nations, we already have many of the entities we need to solve these problems in an integrated way. That realization should motivate us to understand that by next years United Nations Sustainable Development, we can start to make the progress that is necessary. But that means consistency in our efforts to address all forms of insecurity. We need to support peaceful peoples everywhere to assert their basic rights to physical security and development. The global the Arab Spring and other peace response movements across the Middle East has been remarkable for its inconsistency. Guyana supports the right of the Palestinian people to full statehood and urges the acceleration of the negotiations to achieve this. Palestinian rights and blood are as valuable and important as those of people everywhere else. I urge all Importantly, within Conference on to this weeks meeting Members to support the draft resolution when it comes before this body. Guyana was delighted to co-sponsor resolution that resulted in the entry of South Sudan into this General Assembly. But we need to do much more. Guyana will be supportive of all peoples who struggle for democracy and dignity. This also means that we need to rapidly upgrade our response to supporting development, food, energy and resource security. We need to see the Doha trade round not as some zero-sum game between the developed and developing world, but as a critical component to enable the world to meet the urgent challenges that an increasingly prosperous, growing population will present. We need to redouble our efforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals, and to defeat non-communicable diseases. Guyana therefore welcomes on non-communicable diseases and the adoption of the Political Declaration (resolution , annex). Finally, we need to move beyond the global insanity that is our response to climate insecurity. Existing pledges on greenhouse gas emissions under the Copenhagen Accord will not contain global temperature that will avert catastrophic climate change, and some States will face extinction. Moreover, the anaemic delivery on financial pledges made at Copenhagen and formalized in the to a disastrous Cancun agreements breakdown the developed and developing world. The prospects for reaching an internationally legally binding agreement on climate change at the seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Durban, South Africa, would appear rather bleak. There is therefore an urgent need for high-order political leadership to re-energize the climate change process and deliver credible results. To address these challenges, the United Nations and other international institutions need to modernize fast, and the international system needs to correct the inconsistencies between aid, trade and climate policies as I have outlined. In part, this means making the Security Council more democratic, transparent and legitimate. Fifty-four African countries have no permanent seat on the 33 countries that comprise the Latin American and Caribbean region. Guyana strongly supports early the Council; neither do trust between rises within limits is leading in 17 countries and destroy reform of the Security Council through an expansion in both the permanent and non-permanent categories and enhanced representation of developing countries. Todays developed world needs to catch up with the realization that the world has changed, and it is in its vital national interests to change its approach to development issues. Food security is not just about people in poor countries; prices in Europe and the United States are rising too. Energy insecurity will hit todays developed their competitiveness as rapidly as it will hit the developing world. Resource insecurity is already driving up imported inflation in many developed countries and elsewhere. Climate insecurity could be the tipping point for todays Powers to be relegated to history, with all the suffering that would entail for their peoples. So the narrative is changing and I hope that we will rise to the challenge. From now on, I will watch the proceedings in this Hall from afar, but for all of my invocations to the United Nations to do better, it remains the place where noble ambitions are pursued. I wish the United Nations and its Members all the best for a secure, prosperous and socially just future. On behalf of my country and people, I express our full support for the Organization and for strengthening its capacity to better fulfil the many mandates entrusted to it. "}}
