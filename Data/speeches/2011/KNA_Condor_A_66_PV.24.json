{"speech":{"0":" I wish, on behalf of the Government and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis, to express gratitude for the honour of addressing the General Assembly. I also extend on their behalf turn to 6 Most delegations recently participated, sincere congratulations to Mr. Nassir Abdul-Aziz Al-Nasser on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. My delegation also wishes to thank Mr. Joseph Deiss, President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session, for his leadership during a very busy and demanding session. Our new Presidents tenure coincides with a time when there is on the Assemblys agenda a confluence of global issues with particular relevance for the small island developing States of the Caribbean. for example, in the United Nations High-level Meeting on HIAIDS, held in June; the United Nations High- level Meeting on Youth, held in July; and the United Nations High-level Meeting on Non-communicable Diseases, held a few days ago. The convening of those meetings gives ample acknowledgement of the challenges that we still face in our relentless pursuit of a healthier world, and of the pivotal role of health and social cohesion as vehicles of national and global development. The President has the awesome responsibility of piloting us through follow-up actions resulting from those weighty deliberations. My delegation is confident of his capacity and experience for the required leadership, and assures him of our fullest support. The President has declared as his theme for the session “The role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means”. Certainly, my delegation supports the pacific settlement of disputes, and we likewise acknowledge mediation as a preferred vehicle in preventing or settling conflicts. In this endeavour, our small island Caribbean States would wish to be engaged in the support mechanisms in tangible ways, such as are already laid out in the provisions of such landmark resolutions as Security Council (2004), which addresses the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The people of my country and my region have great respect for the idealism that gave birth to this all- important Organization. Our indeed synonymous with those of the United Nations system, and our expectations are assuredly no less stately than those of large and powerful nations. At a time such as this, the United Nations must show its unifying character by assuring that all resolution 1540 ideals are is invariably is required integrated approach Member States are equipped to play a role in the maintenance of international peace and security and in the building up of one another. We are our brothers keeper. In todays global community, we must rely heavily on collective actions and solid partnerships, if we are to overcome the many common challenges that we face. Among those challenges are the misguided or ill-considered choices that are made by too many of our youth. A critical and defining aspect of my countrys future, and indeed a prospect that will largely define tomorrows world, is our youth. It is therefore worthy of mention that youth violence has attained epidemic proportions in the Caribbean. We appreciate that youth violence symptomatic of deeper individual, community and societal issues, and that a multisectoral, to redress the problem. At the national and regional levels, States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) are actively grappling with this challenge, and we are pleased to have participated in the discussions on this topic at the recent High-level Meeting. There is a need, however, to reinforce the fact that there is a role for United Nations agencies in supporting our efforts to reverse the bothersome trend of youth violence, with all its implications for many critical sectors, including security, health and development. Accordingly, we shall be heightening our engagement with WHO, UN-HABITAT, UNICEF and other international relevant United Nations and development agencies in this endeavour. The challenge of youth violence is also linked, to some extent, to the proliferation of small arms and light weapons. While my country acknowledges the strides made in our region with respect to small arms and light weapons, through the recent adoption of the CARICOM Declaration on Small Arms and Light Weapons, there is still a long way to go. It is imperative, therefore, that we work together to bring a solution-focused approach to the problem of easy access to small arms and light weapons in our countries. CARICOM here calls for an arms trade treaty. Related to this challenge is the issue of human security and development. My country is committed to 7 to support in keeping with countries achieve working diligently at the national and regional levels, and to collaborating internationally, to improve the lives of our people. Saint Kitts and Nevis is a relatively small country, and it is usually the small and vulnerable that are most severely impacted when global shocks and crises occur. That is why, as a region, we promote collective action to enhance our resilience, promote human security, lessen our vulnerability and build stronger economies. Such has been our widely acclaimed best-practice approach with regard to HIAIDS. Saint Kitts and Nevis applauds the General Assembly for convening the High-level Meeting on HIAIDS. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIAIDS (UNAIDS) has collaborated with the Pan Caribbean Partnership its Against HIV and AIDS, commitment the Millennium Development Goals and also in ensuring that HIV prevention, care, treatment and support services are provided to all in need. The agenda is still a full one and the challenge no less daunting than it was 10 years ago, in a region with the second highest global prevalence rate of HIV. We therefore anticipate and encourage the continued support of UNAIDS and other health and development agencies. to non-communicable diseases With (NCDs), the Caribbean can be justly proud that the initiatives in the Port of Spain Declaration of 2007 — “Uniting to Stop the Epidemic of Chronic NCDs” — which arose out of the first-ever heads of Government summit on the subject, has resonated across the globe, resulting in the just concluded High-level Meeting with a consensus on launching an international wellness revolution. Non-communicable diseases are to a large extent preventable. It is therefore essential that the outcome document from the High-level Meeting mirrors many of the chief concerns of the Port of Spain Declaration, aimed at encouraging Governments and the private sector increasing avenues for exercise, healthy diets and smoke-free zones for the benefit of the general public. A long-term reduction in the enormous costs of treating heart failure, diabetes and hypertension, and the resulting 60 per cent to 70 per cent mortality rates to collaborate on regard in resources, health and HIAIDS from NCDs, is worth the investment in protecting human capital and the development of our various regions. I am extremely proud that the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis has the lead responsibility for the human Caribbean Community, and continues to play a pioneering role. We recognize the urgent need to make good on pledges resulting from the High-level Meeting, which can only augur well for a future in which due recognition must be given to the role of health in overall development. It would be remiss of me not to highlight the significance of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. Next June, during this sixty- sixth session of the General Assembly, all eyes will be the Rio deliberations aimed at achieving on convergence on social, environmental and economic dimensions of sustainable development. I fully support the main objective of the Conference, namely, securing political commitment. That is the critical factor for success throughout the Rio+20 processes and beyond. Saint Kitts and Nevis is one of the small island developing States (SIDS) referred to in chapter 17 of Agenda 21. Throughout the international community has made tremendous strides in sustainable development. Regrettably, many an encouraging step forward has been offset by painful setbacks. The effect of climate change is a bane that is felt on a daily basis in Saint Kitts and Nevis, as in other islands. The question is no longer “if” and “how”, but rather “when” and “by how much” we will be affected. We need desperately to upgrade pre-emptive measures, to counter the imminent threat of climate change. to aggressively promote climate financing is highly recommended. It will be vital if our countries are to successfully address the effects of climate change without tapping into already limited and depleted resources. My delegation encourages other Member States to join the call for the full implementation of climate financing. In addition to pursuing outcomes that benefit all States, my delegation would like to highlight certain challenges that some members of the international the past 20 years, A defined strategy addressing SIDS challenges the to 8 community face, with which the General Assembly can assist. I speak of Haiti, Antigua and Barbuda, Cuba and Taiwan. We must ever remember Haiti, one of the most populous member States of CARICOM. We should remain acutely aware of Haitis trials and struggles against natural and man-made catastrophic events, unsettling social and political vicissitudes and economic hardships. Their effects have set Haiti many years behind, compared to the rate of development of other nations in the region. We therefore encourage the fulfilling of the many goodwill pledges that have been made for assistance in its reconstruction efforts. Another CARICOM member State, Antigua and Barbuda, continues to be locked in an underdog struggle to benefit from its success before the World Trade Organization Dispute Settlement Body. We again urge a speedy, fair and just resolution to this gaming dispute. Also within the Caribbean, the people of our sister nation of Cuba continue to endure much hardship as the consequence of a 50-year commercial, economic and the international community have consistently called for the lifting of the embargo. Our country reiterates its call, and the call of regional neighbours and the international community, particularly the General Assembly, for a speedy redress of this matter. Since 2009, Taiwan has been invited by the World Health Organization to attend the annual World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer. This practice and the related arrangements have established what has been termed the WHA model, which sets a useful precedent for Taiwans greater participation in the United Nations system. It is the view of my country that in todays highly integrated and interconnected world almost all issues demand full participation by, and cooperation among, international partners. As one of the worlds leading economic and technological powerhouses, Taiwan can contribute substantially to the international community. We therefore urge the United Nations to find a for Taiwans meaningful suitable way participation and mechanisms, including the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. financial embargo. The Assembly and to allow in specialized agencies its I have presented some of the challenges that we encounter as a country and region, challenges to which the Assembly has itself given prominence. I have also given consideration to some of our aspirations for the sixty-sixth session and beyond. They are issues that demand collective inputs and interventions. We are all part of the global community, and problems that permeate our tightly woven fabric invariably spread to affect us all in some way or another. It is incumbent upon us all, therefore, to ensure that the results of our collective enterprise and diligence allow for the realization of our desired goals. Surely, working together with purpose and integrity will ensure that we rise on the same tide. Let us rise together. "}}
