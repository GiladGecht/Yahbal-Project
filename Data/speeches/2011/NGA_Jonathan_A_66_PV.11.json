{"speech":{"0":" On Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and to invite him to address the Assembly. the Government and people of Nigeria, I would like to congratulate the President on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. I have no doubt that under his able leadership the work of the session will be brought to a successful conclusion. I should also like to acknowledge the excellent work done by his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, who guided the affairs of the sixty- fifth session with consummate skill and commitment. I must also take this opportunity to extend my warmest to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his well-deserved re-election, a tribute to his leadership and vision. He deserves our appreciation for the good work he is doing on our behalf. I also welcome the newest member of the Organization, the Republic of South Sudan. I am confident that South Sudan will bring a unique perspective to the work of the United Nations and enrich our collective experience. Despite our initial optimism, the peace dividend we had hoped would accrue following the end of the Cold War is yet to materialize. On the contrary, the world of the twenty-first century in which we live is becoming ever more precarious, unpredictable and certainly more dangerous — perhaps more than at any other time in history. The increasing use of terror in various regions of the world as a form of political action poses a serious threat to international peace and security. We must win the war against terror because it infringes on the fundamental right of all peoples to life and to live in safety from fear. Over the past few months, we in Nigeria have faced an upsurge in terrorist attacks in parts of our country. Only recently, the United Nations building in Abuja housing several United Nations agencies was the target of an atrocious terrorist attack that left several dead. On behalf of the Government and people of Nigeria, sincere condolences to the families of the victims and to the entire United Nations family for this barbaric and heinous attack on those who have dedicated their lives to helping others. As the United States and the rest of the world commemorate the tenth anniversary of the attacks of , we are reminded of the international to convey my I would like 43 the to relevant in order terrorism and imperative of a international bodies and sharpen our dimension of concerted global response to combat this scourge. For us in Nigeria, terrorist acts, rather than intimidating us, will only help to strengthen our resolve to develop appropriate national strategies and to collaborate even more closely with the international community in the fight against this menace. As part of Nigerias efforts to fight terrorism, on 3 June, I signed into law a terrorism bill and an anti-money-laundering prohibition amendment act. The new laws not only outline measures for preventing and combating acts of terrorism, but also prohibit the financing of terrorism and laundering of the proceeds of crime. Nigeria will continue to work with the United Nations and other partners in this global fight. To that end, Nigeria is working closely with the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force and the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate, as well as with friendly countries, response mechanisms. In that connection, the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force will launch its first project in Abuja in November, which will be aimed at preventing conflict and countering the appeal of terrorism to youth through education and dialogue. In addition, Nigeria is a member of a new global body, the Global Counterterrorism Forum, launched to galvanize and help pull our efforts together to fight this scourge in all its ramifications. We pledge to continue to work with all stakeholders as we enlarge and intensify our partnerships. When I stood before the Assembly last year, I made a solemn pledge that Nigeria would conduct free and credible elections in the second quarter of this year. I am glad to report that last April we indeed conducted what have been adjudged to be credible and transparent general elections. Let me this opportunity to thank the United Nations and all the other organizations, nations and individuals that helped us to achieve that feat. The elections are now behind us, and the Government that I head is well on course to implement our programmes of transformation — a strategic plan for the delivery of the dividends of democracy to citizens and for preparing our country for the challenges of the future. Indeed, all across my country, there is a renewed sense of optimism and self- belief in our ability to recreate a new Nigeria on the principles of personal freedoms, democracy, good governance and the rule of law. take and early identification Permit me to identify with the theme of this years debate of engaging the role of mediation in the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the world. The Assembly will recall that Nigeria was in the forefront of the campaign to promote this theme when, as the President of the Security Council in July 2010, my country adopted the use of preventive diplomacy to resolve armed conflicts across the world. This theme is apt and could not have come at a better time, when armed conflicts are increasingly taking a greater part of the time and resources of the United Nations. For too long, the international community has focused too little attention on mediation and preventive diplomacy, and far too much effort and resources on the military aspects of peace and security. Yet measures to address the root cause of conflict, including dialogue and mediation, can be far more effective as a means for achieving sustainable peace and stability. I believe that cultivating peace and fulfilling the aims of Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter require appropriate intervention in conflict situations in order to build confidence and trust and to preclude the eruption of violence between opposing parties. As I see it, our goal should always be to present the peaceful alternative as a less costly and effective way of achieving political and social objectives. I also believe that, in addition to other tools of preventive diplomacy, democracy and good governance can be particularly important in building a just, equitable and inclusive society. By focusing on mediation as a tool for conflict prevention, we are able to address the real triggers of conflict, without which we cannot achieve sustainable solutions. However, for the world to move from a culture of response after conflict that of a culture of prevention, the international community must muster the political will to promote preventive diplomacy, in particular through mediation. This will necessarily entail financial resources to institutions and mechanisms that already exist, within and outside the United Nations system, for conflict prevention and resolution. Going forward, I would like to propose the establishment, under the Secretary-Generals Office, of a conflict mediation commission, to be charged, among other things, with collating information on conflict situations across the world, identifying the dramatis rededicating greater human and traditional to 44 the to the our to, to the This explains light weapons This naturally brings me personae and developing appropriate strategies for initiating resolution of such conflicts. The commission would also develop rules of engagement, including sanctions that would apply to those who may obstruct efforts to resolve conflicts peacefully. issue of trafficking in small arms and light weapons. If the idea of resolving conflicts through mediation is to succeed, then the problem of trafficking in small arms and light weapons must be frontally tackled. The proliferation of small arms and is particularly worrisome, due their easy accessibility and availability to unauthorized persons and groups, who in turn have used these arms to create instability and insecurity in most of the countries of the developing world. Even worse, the proliferation of these weapons has proved handy in the hands of terrorists. and commitment preoccupation with, the actualization of an arms trade treaty that robustly addresses the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, which, as we all know, are among the major causes of destabilization and conflict in Africa. The danger of the proliferation of, and illicit trade in, small arms and light weapons informed Nigerias decision to sponsor resolution , of 2006, the principal objective being to provide a legally binding in conventional arms. We will continue to support all initiatives towards the realization of an arms trade treaty in 2012. I call on all Member States to join in this endeavour. The increasing rate of piracy and other maritime crimes, with their attendant damaging effects on security, trade and economic activities in the Gulf of Guinea and other locations, calls for coordinated regional and global approaches. In this respect, I would like to express support for the proposal of the Secretary-General to deploy a United Nations assessment mission to study the situation in the Gulf of Guinea and explore possible options for United Nations support and action. Our expectation is that a positive outcome from such a strategy will benefit not only our subregion but international community as well. I am already consulting with other leaders in our subregion to boost this initiative. The United Nations strategy for gender equality and womens empowerment, especially through the creation of UN-Women, deserves commendation and instrument for international larger the trade look forward support. Nigerias support for UN-Women, to which we have made substantial contributions, reflects our desire to harness the potential of women in the task of nation-building. Our national action plan on gender equality and womens empowerment places strong emphasis on womens effective participation in politics and adequate representation in public office. I am indeed proud to announce to the Assembly that more than 30 per cent of my Cabinet is made up of women. Let me also commend the Executive Board of UN-Women on the successful take-off of the entity. UN-Women can be assured of Nigerias strong support. This year, the prevention of non-communicable diseases was one of the issues slated for discussion at a High-level Meeting. Only three months ago, I attended the High-level Meeting on AIDS, where I pledged Nigerias commitment to health care, as part of our countrys human capital development agenda. My Government is intensifying efforts to improve national health-care delivery by allocating substantial resources to primary health care. We to a productive outcome to the High-level Meeting on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases at the end of that meeting. In the same vein, I welcome discussions at the High-level Meeting on desertification and land degradation, as to pose challenges to our development efforts. That is why Nigeria the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention including strategies and best practices to address this challenge. In order to demonstrate our commitment to human rights, Nigeria recently ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and acceded to four other international human rights instruments, including the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. In addition, this year, my Government passed into law the National Human Rights Commission Amendment Act, the Legal Aid Council Amendment Act and the Freedom of Information Act. Nigeria will continue to accord the highest priority to human rights issues, as they speak directly to the dignity and inalienable rights of humankind. on Biological Diversity, issues continue supports strongly these 45 realities can provide. I urge the President of the General Assembly to set up clear criteria for the reform of the Security Council in line with the demand of the majority of the world. A reformed Security Council is the only way to demonstrate that all nations have an equal stake in the United Nations. Nigeria looks forward to the prospect of membership in a reformed Security Council. "}}
