{"speech":{"0":" This morning the Assembly heard a statement by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Albania, Mr. Sali Berisha. In what has become an annual ritual, he devoted a significant part of his statement to the problem of Kosovo, a statement which contained the expected misrepresentations and falsehoods. They are of such a nature that they simply must not remain unanswered. Let me attempt to deal with them as briefly and succinctly as possible. Prime Minister Berisha stated that Kosovo “has shown assiduous commitment and seriousness in the process of negotiations in Brussels” (). It is equally true that Kosovo has shown assiduous commitment and seriousness by, in parallel, taking unilateral actions of a coercive nature, attempting to create a fait accompli on issues on which negotiations were still pending. By so doing, Kosovo creates tensions and conflicts, thus endangering the very process of negotiations to which it is supposedly committed. The truth is that Kosovo is not committed to that process at all. Aware that every process of negotiations involves give and take, Kosovo, emboldened by its mighty protectors, wants only to take. No sustainable solution has ever been possible on that basis. Prime Minister Berisha misrepresented the July 2010 advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, stating that it decided that “the declaration of independence of Kosovo” — supposedly from the Albanian version of the opinion — “is in full compliance with international law.” (ibid.) The Court never said that; it actually concluded that “the declaration of independence of 17 February 2008 did not violate general international law” (, para. 84), but only because “the Court considers that general international law contains no applicable prohibition of declarations of independence.” That formulation does not convey the opinion of the Court that the unilateral secession of Kosovo is legitimate, or that Kosovo became, through it, an independent State. The Court made it very clear that it did not even consider whether the declaration was justified, or whether it produced any legal effects. Every international lawyer knows that in actuality the real question posed remained unanswered. And, by the way, it created a number of dissenting opinions in the Court. Prime Minister Berisha spoke of “Ahtisaaris package”. It is obviously a “package” only for Kosovo and Albania, since neither Serbia nor the Security Council ever accepted it. It therefore remains at the level of individual ideas on the Kosovo problem. Furthermore, Prime Minister Berisha also stated that “Serbian cultural heritage in Kosovo is today more secured than ever.” (). In evaluating that phrase, one should only remember the Albanian pogrom of Serbs in 2004, when over 30 Christian Orthodox churches were destroyed. The remaining churches continue to be routinely desecrated today. 18 Prime Minister Berisha asserted that “interethnic relations in all areas where Serbs and Albanians live together in the same communities are very good” (ibid.). One should only analyse the minuscule number of Serbs returning to their properties in Kosovo, and daily accounts of attacks on remaining Serbs and their property, to see that that is a rose-coloured image of a grim reality. The Prime Minister of Albania spoke of “criminal groups and organized gangs that with weapons and other means are doing all in their hand to devastate the rule of law.” (ibid.). I suppose that the Prime Minister was speaking of Albanian groups, which have a long tradition of trampling the rule of law in Kosovo and in a number of other countries of the world. Films have been made on that subject, and even here, in New York, dozens of members of the Albanian mafia were apprehended only a few months ago. On the issue of the return of the remains of victims of the conflict in Kosovo, the Republic of Serbia has shown full readiness to do everything in its power to complete that task. It expects Kosovo to do the same. It is really difficult to listen to, or read afterwards, the attempts of the Prime Minister of Albania to deny the most horrendous crimes committed anywhere in the region of former Yugoslavia during the period of conflict: abducting hundreds of younger Serbs, killing them and selling their organs on the black market. It is easy to understand why the Prime Minister is doing it, because most of those crimes were committed in the territory of Albania. But implying that Carla del Ponte, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and Dick Marty and all the witnesses he spoke to are lying is simply too much. If he believes that he can wish those crimes away, we believe that he is wrong, and that the international community will insist on a full investigation and the prosecution of the perpetrators of the crimes, which are without parallel in modern humanity. Mr. Hoxha (Albania): I am compelled to exercise my right of reply after the comments made by the representative of Serbia in exercise of his right of reply. I profoundly disagree with what we heard. It is a well known fact that Albania and Serbia disagree on the Kosovo issue, as was also witnessed during the general debate. Nevertheless, Albania, like many other Member States, and an ever-growing number of them, is convinced that the independent Kosovo is the only solution in a region torn apart by war, fuelled by ethnic hatred of the Serbia under Milosevic rule. The independent Kosovo, as reality has proved, is, and will be, a key contribution to peace and stability in the region, and Albania continues to hope that Serbia will come to terms with this undeniable and irreversible reality. Last year, the Assembly received with respect the International Court of Justice advisory opinion (see ) on the declaration of independence of Kosovo, an opinion that, we should remember, was requested by Serbia. We all know the Courts conclusion — although we heard a semantic effort that said the same thing — that the declaration of independence did not violate any provision of international law. As was stated many times before the ruling, Serbia is expected to accept and respect the Courts findings. We are still waiting for that to happen. It needs to be emphasized that during the recent troubles caused by vandalism and primitivism in the north of Kosovo the open support offered by Belgrade to that unrest had a clear purpose. For months now, senior Serbian ministers and other high Government officials have rivalled each other in their declarations that the partition of Kosovo is the only solution. We need to remind the Assembly that whoever speaks of partition, of changing borders in the Balkans, is looking back to the darkest moments of recent Balkan history, which we think, and hope, will never return. Like many other countries, Albania extends its full support to the Government of Kosovo to implement the rule of law, exercise its authority in close cooperation with the international presence there, and never yield to criminals, to the parallel structures and to individuals who care only for their own interest, and not the interests of the Serbian community they pretend to represent. As German Chancellor Angela Merkel said a few weeks ago in Belgrade, Serbia must implement agreements with Kosovo, allow the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) to operate in the entire territory of Kosovo, and abolish the parallel structures in the north. We are waiting to see whether this message has been well understood in Belgrade. 19 The Serbian representative referred to a document known as the Dick Marty report. Let me be clear: the Albanian Government considers this report, and the heinous crimes it alleges, to be pure speculation, misleading assertions and unfounded conclusions that have no match with reality. Albania is a democracy, a State of the rule of law and a society that has put respect for human rights and dignity at the foundations of its society. Albania, as a party most interested in the truth, has officially invited EULEX to investigate in full, and in a transparent and independent manner, all aspects of those allegations that involve any part of Albanian territory. For that very reason, Albania voted for the resolution of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, as it believes that the ongoing investigation is the only way to cut short the loud propaganda, which we heard again this evening and which has been going on for too long. The question is whether Serbia will be able to accept the findings of the EULEX investigation or will act in the way that it did with regard to the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, which, as I have said, Serbia itself asked for. Albania and Serbia are two democracies, members of the south-east European community, which we believe is moving fast towards the future it deserves. We look forward to, and are working towards, a more integrated region at all levels. As has been repeatedly stated, we are ready to develop bilateral relations with Serbia, in the very same way as we are developing them with all the other countries in the region. We have many common issues to develop in what we see as our common agenda, the most important one being European Union integration, which we think should be the main drive for our common future. Mr. Milanovic (Serbia): My delegation has said all that we deemed necessary in relation to the statement of the Prime Minister of Albania. It is up to the members of the Assembly to draw their own conclusions, since we see no need to prolong this exchange. Mr. Hoxha (Albania): I am really glad that we at least agree that we have no need to prolong this discussion"}}
