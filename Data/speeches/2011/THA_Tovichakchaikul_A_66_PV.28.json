{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Thailand, allow me to extend to you, Sir, our warmest congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. It is a personal honour for me to speak for the first time before this gathering of the worlds nations. Please be assured of my delegations full support and cooperation in the conduct of the work of this body. The year 2011 has already become a monumental year in modern history. The call for reforms in the Middle East and North Africa has led to unprecedented transitions and popular uprisings. The so-called Arab the significance of peoples Spring underscores legitimate aspirations and respond adequately to them. In this age of globalization, information, ideas and values flow beyond borders. For Thailand, after experiencing some political unrest, the country has taken another step forward in its democratic process. The general elections held on 3 July this year went smoothly, which is a testament to the resilience of Thai democracy. The new Government has been successfully formed, with a solid mandate from the people. Indeed, the voter turnout was the highest history. The Administration of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra is now working resolutely to deliver on the promises it made during the election campaign. In implementing people-centred policies, it seeks to establish a strong, in Thailands the need electoral 34 to play a Thailand seeks further enhance equitable and sustainable economic infrastructure in the country. More importantly, the Government is determined to promote reconciliation and uphold the rule of law to serve as a basis for harmony and unity within the country. As far as our foreign relations are concerned, the Government will relations with neighbouring countries and our friends outside the region. Special emphasis is placed on promoting trust, confidence and mutual respect, which is particularly important as we prepare for the realization of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Community in 2015. We will also strengthen international cooperation at all forums and levels, particularly with the United Nations. responsible and constructive role in the current international order. Thailand is convinced that the three pillars of the United Nations ─ peace and security, development and human rights ─ are all interconnected and mutually reinforcing. They are issues that need to be addressed comprehensively in order to achieve the ultimate goal of human security for our peoples. They are also issues that Thailand will emphasize in its cooperation with the United Nations. In terms of peace and security, Thailand believes that this years theme for the General Assemblys general debate, as proposed by you, Mr. President, is very timely. Mediation is a crucial tool for helping to resolve disputes peacefully. The recent birth of the Republic of South Sudan and its swift admission to the United Nations are clear testaments to the constructive role of Mediterranean and the continued engagement of the United Nations in conflict resolution. Thailand welcomes the Republic of South Sudan into the global community, and wishes to forge bilateral relations and a partnership for development with this new State. Thailand is convinced that the peaceful resolution of conflicts is the most desirable and cost-effective approach in terms of both human lives and financial expense. For that reason, political will remains a key ingredient without which such an approach cannot be successful. Wishing to do our part, Thailand has actively supported the comprehensive peace operations and peacekeeping missions of the United Nations in more than 20 locations around the world. We are currently deploying an infantry battalion with the African Union- and adheres to approach lasting peace United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur. We have also sent police and military officers to the United Nations peacekeeping missions in Timor-Leste and Haiti, and we are about to deploy military officers to a United Nations operation in Kashmir. In addition, since autumn 2010 Thailand has sent two counter-piracy task groups to join international efforts to patrol and protect ships from pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden area. These are just a few examples of our effort to play a meaningful role in maintaining international peace and security. If international stability is one of our primary goals, Thailand firmly believes that a key foundation sustainable development. for is Sustainable development is an essential tool for eradicating poverty and inequality, which are root causes of insecurity. As the guiding principle of our social and economic policy, Thailand has long taken a people-centred the sufficiency-economy philosophy of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, which focuses on living in moderation and striking a balance between economic growth and the sustainable management of natural resources. Our Government is also working resolutely to ensure, among other things, equal opportunity for all, free primary and secondary education, and universal health care coverage. Although we have achieved most of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ahead of schedule, we are resolutely pursuing the MDG Plus targets. In the greater scheme of things, we are determined that no one in Thai society should be left behind. to be realized, cooperation among all sectors of society and partnerships with the international community are essential. Thailand has been active in promoting partnerships between developed and developing countries, and stands ready to serve as a bridge between both groups through triangular cooperation. At the same time, we will continue to strengthen South- fellow developing South cooperation with our countries, in the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 and China. Thailand has also assumed a more creative and proactive role in cooperation with the international community in various development areas. Over the years, relations between the United Nations and In order for sustainable development including those 35 relationship to one of partners Thailand have evolved from a traditional donor- recipient in development. Neither development nor peace and security can be sustainable if respect for human rights lags behind. Thailand firmly believes that human rights represent truly universal values. Respect for them must be a fundamental principle in every society. For Thailand, human rights issues are at the core of our domestic and foreign policy agendas. In terms of foreign policy, Thailand has striven to play a constructive role at the regional and international levels, especially through our membership of the Human Rights Council. During our presidency of the Council, Thailand was proud to direct the crucial task of reviewing its methods of work and operations in order to make it more relevant and credible. This was particularly important when it came to responding to urgent human rights situations in a more timely and effective manner. Every Government must find its own solutions and move at its own pace in a manner appropriate to its specific context and conditions. Meanwhile, it is incumbent on the international community to support and promote constructive dialogue and engagement with countries of concern, while respecting their sovereignty, territorial integrity and the will of the people. Such support and dialogue should aim at strengthening States capacity to meet their human rights obligations. Here it is important, in Thailands view, to find common ground on the value of technical cooperation in enhancing human rights. We have been holding consultations on an initiative to enhance the efficiency of the Human Rights Council in providing technical cooperation to countries in need. Thailand hopes that this initiative will receive the broad-based support of countries from all regions in the Council. With our genuine commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, Thailand is determined to continue playing a constructive role in the Council. In that regard, we will proudly stand for election once again for the 2015-2017 term. As Thailand continues to enhance its participation as a member of the Human Rights Council, we are determined to further contribute to human rights work and to strengthen the rights of vulnerable groups, both at home and abroad. We attach special importance to such groups, be they children, women, people with disabilities or the elderly. One notable example is in the area of womens rights. In December 2010, the General Assembly adopted the United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders, or the Bangkok Rules (resolution ), based on an initiative of Her Royal Highness Princess Bajrakitiyabha. The Rules aim to enhance the human rights of female prisoners in criminal justice systems by fully recognizing gender sensitivity and the specific needs of women. Thailand is committed to promoting the implementation of the Bangkok Rules worldwide and looks forward to continuing to work closely with all relevant stakeholders. Moreover, the recent election of the countrys first female Prime Minister confirms that Thai society is open to women and that we continue to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women. It should be evident from all I have said that the United Nations is a cornerstone of Thailands foreign policy, and that Thailand has been an active player in all three pillars of the United Nations. Peace and security, development and human rights are truly inseparable and should be strengthened simultaneously. Given our past experience and continued contributions to all three, especially the maintenance of international peace and security, Thailand has presented its candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the 2017-2018 term. We seek the support of our friends in the United Nations in this regard. We are convinced that such a position would enable us to fulfil our and constructively with all Members of the United Nations. Let us rise to the challenge together. Mr. Nassirou Bako Arifari, Minister Affairs, African Beninese Abroad of the Republic of Benin. Mr. Bako Arifari (Benin) (spoke in French): I should like at the outset to convey to you, Sir, my heartfelt and sincere congratulations on your well- deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session and to wish you every success in discharging your mandate.
