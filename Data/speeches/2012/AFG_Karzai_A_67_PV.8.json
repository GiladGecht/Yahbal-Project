{"speech":{"0":" As we speak today, the world is being shaken by the depravity of fanatics who have committed acts insulting the faith of more than 1.5 billion Muslims. We strongly condemn such offensive acts, whether they involve the production of a film, the publication of cartoons or indeed any other insults and provocations. Such acts can never be justified as manifestations of freedom of speech or expression. Equally, they cannot become a reason for genuine protests to be used to incite violence and terrible losses of innocent lives.It is a matter for grave concern that our world remains strewn with daily outbreaks of violence, hatred and injustice. In particular, the menace of Islamophobia is a worrying phenomenon that threatens peace and coexistence among cultures and civilizations. I call on 21Apart from advancing transition and pursuing the peace process, the past year has been one of significant progress for consolidating international commitment and partnership. In Chicago in May, we received the long-term commitment of NATO and other countries to training, equipping and ensuring the sustainability of the Afghan National Security Forces. In Tokyo this past July, the international community reaffirmed its strong commitment to Afghanistans social and economic development during the transformation decade, for which we are grateful.The Mutual Accountability Framework adopted in Tokyo sets in place a clear structure for a more results-oriented partnership and cooperation. We welcome the international communitys readiness to align aid with our national priorities and channel assistance through the Afghan budget. For our part, we have reiterated our determination to improve governance and to collaborate with our international partners to wipe out the cancer of corruption, whether it is in the Afghan Government or the international aid system.We recognize that Afghanistans destiny is tied to the region that surrounds it, with respect both to our common threats, such as terrorism, extremism and narcotics, and to the opportunities we must grasp to grow and prosper. In that context, the Istanbul Process presents a new agenda for security, confidence-building and cooperation across the region of which Afghanistan is the centre. We will spare no effort to build strong and lasting relations with our neighbors near and extended.Turning to the international arena, Afghanistan views the situation in Syria with much concern. Over the course of the past year, thousands of our Syrian brothers and sisters have lost their lives due to an escalating cycle of violence. We welcome the appointment of the new Joint Special Representative for Syria of the United Nations and League of Arab States, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi. We know him very well. Mr. Brahimi is well respected in Afghanistan, and he brings vast experience and a unique ability to the task before him. Here, I say to the people of Syria that we Afghans have experienced violence ourselves, and we know what it takes to rebuild a country. I hope very much, on behalf of the Afghan people, that the Syrians will sit down together as soon as possible and find a way to end the violence, since it will be not easy to repair.have initiated a peace and reconciliation process, which aims to induce all elements of the armed opposition to take up peaceful lives in our country.At this time last year, my visit to the General Assembly was cut short by the tragic assassination of Professor Burhanuddin Rabbani, the then Chairman of the High Peace Council. A terrorist posing as a peace emissary took his life, and by doing so dealt our peace process a serious blow. This year, however, and fortunately, the late Professors son, Mr. Salahuddin Rabbani, who stepped up to take the Chair of the High Peace Council, is part of the Afghan delegation and present in the Assembly today.I have often said that our hand of peace and reconciliation remains extended not only to the Taliban but also to all other armed opposition groups who wish to return to dignified, peaceful and independent lives in their own homeland. What we ask of them in return is simple: bringing an end to violence, cutting ties with terrorist networks, preserving the valuable gains of the past decade and respecting the Constitution of Afghanistan. To help facilitate the peace process, I am asking the Security Council to give its full support to our efforts. In particular, I urge the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011), the Taliban sanctions committee, to make more active efforts to delist Taliban leaders, as a step towards facilitating direct negotiations.In pursuing the path of peace, we remain hopeful about the critical role that our fraternal neighbour the Islamic Republic of Pakistan has to play. Over recent years, we have engaged our brothers in Pakistan in a close dialogue in support of the Afghan peace process. It is a dialogue that we believe is critical for Pakistans own security and for the security of the wider region and beyond. We are deeply committed to our brotherly relations with Pakistan, but we are aware of the challenges that may strain our efforts to build trust and confidence. Such incidents as the recent shelling of Afghan villages risk undermining the efforts of both Governments to work together in the interest of our common security and prosperity.For the past two years, our national priority has been to have Afghanistans own security forces assume full responsibility for the security of our country and our people. The transition process will be completed by mid-2013 and NATO and International Security Assistance Force forces withdrawn from our country by the end of 2014.22 Ssekandi, Vice-President of the Republic of Uganda, and inviting him to address the General Assembly.Mr. Ssekandi (Uganda): Uganda joins other delegations in congratulating Mr. Jeremic on his election as President of this body. My delegation has full confidence in his ability to steer our deliberations, and he can count on our support. I also wish to commend Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for his effective leadership during the last session.The international community has made significant progress in reducing conflicts around the world over the two decades since the end of the Cold War and the eventual freedom of South Africa from apartheid. However, we still face challenges arising from conflicts that take a heavy toll on nations and people around the world. The theme for this sessions debate is therefore timely and pertinent. We are again seeing an increase in conflicts brought about by unconstitutional changes of Governments, disputed elections, social tensions, extremist ideologies and territorial or border disputes, among other causes. We must redouble our efforts to resolve conflicts and disputes through peaceful means and in conformity with justice and international law, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.From Ugandas experience over the years, conflicts are best handled, first and foremost, by the political actors and citizens of the countries in question, following democratic principles and guided by the principle of equality of all persons before the law. In cases where national actors for some reason cannot resolve the problem, then subregional organizations should step in. In the case of Africa those include the East African Community, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), the Southern African Development Community, the Economic Community of West African States and others. The United Nations and the international community would then provide the necessary support to subregional and regional initiatives. Our recent achievements in the peace processes in Burundi, the Sudan, South Sudan and Somalia, among others, attest to the progress we can achieve by working together. The advantages of such an approach include the use of local actors who have more discerning knowledge of the problems and those in close proximity and with a greater stake in getting the problems resolved. In addition, there is the international support The continuing plight of the Palestinian people has been a source of deep distress for Afghanistan and the rest of the international community. The people of Palestine have suffered immensely for far too long. We remain in full support of the realization of the rights of our brothers and sisters in Palestine, including their right to an independent Palestinian State. The time has come for an end to the occupation and for realizing the just aspirations of the people of Palestine.Finally, reform of the United Nations remains an important item on the international agenda. Since its inception in 1945, the United Nations has exercised a key role in promoting a safer and more secure world, improving the lives of citizens worldwide, and safeguarding and promoting human rights. Nevertheless, in view of our ever-changing world, we cannot deny the fact that the Organization is in dire need of comprehensive reform, enabling it to better reflect the new challenges and realities of our time. The reform of the Security Council is long overdue. Achieving a reformed Council that is more inclusive, representative and transparent must remain a priority. We welcome the ongoing progress within the framework of the intergovernmental negotiations."}}
