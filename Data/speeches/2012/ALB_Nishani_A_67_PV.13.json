{"speech":{"0":" We gather here every year to share our analysis, our views and comments on the course of world events. We also take this opportunity to share our concerns and to meet, interact and try to offer our best commitment to finding appropriate solutions to current and future challenges. A year has passed since the last session, and the world has continued to change. Development and economic growth in many countries have raised hundreds of millions of people above the poverty line. Societies throughout the world are taking a stand today, demanding more rights and asking for effective political participation. Democracy, human rights and increased participation by women in public and social 10 difficulties in our history, we have always preserved and cherished the values of freedom and respect for the other that are fundamental to the modern concept of human rights. Albanians respect for one anothers rights and individuality is expressed first and foremost in an exemplary religious harmony. They have shown an outstanding acceptance of, and respect for, other cultures, ethnicities and civilizations, and have devoted special care and attention to those who have come seeking safe refuge from the horrors of war. Albanians have risked their own lives and far outspent their economic capacity in order to rescue and save those in need who came knocking at their door.It is against that backdrop that Albania remains a strong believer in dialogue among civilizations and continues to engage actively in bridging the differences among the wider membership on issues pertaining to the human rights agenda. That is why Albania, which currently presides over the Council of Europe, has chosen “United in diversity” as its theme. The dialogue among different cultures and civilizations should be seen as an ongoing process requiring dedication, goodwill and care. We cannot allow the sporadic reckless actions of disruptive groups to prevent us from making a genuine effort to reach a better understanding of one another in a world that is becoming more globalized every day.Although we were saddened and embittered by the worthless video that deliberately targets what Muslims everywhere consider sacred, Albanians, Muslims and Christians alike have expressed their indignation by simply ignoring such nonsense. We regret that the reaction to it in some parts of the world was different, used instead to fuel blind violence by angry, hopeless crowds, with fatal consequences. We must be clear: any form of terrorism or extremist act on the part of isolated, malevolent groups should never be confused with the position or identified with the attitude of an entire society or Government. No legitimate anger can excuse illegitimate violent acts that Governments, societies and political and religious leaders should firmly oppose. We condemn with indignation the terrorist act against American Consulate staff and premises in Libya and demand that the perpetrators be punished. We also condemn any act of violent protest against the Western embassies, whose mission it is to promote understanding and cooperation among countries and nations.With a foreign policy based on peace and good relations with all nations, its modest but important contribution to international missions aimed at safeguarding peace and human rights through a policy of good neighbourliness, as well as its efforts to play a moderate and constructive role in the region, Albania has become a direct contributor to stability and security on the regional and global levels. We are determined to maintain and further build on that record.Today, Albania participates in peacekeeping missions in several international operations within the framework of the United Nations and other regional security organizations, including in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iraq and more. My country acknowledges and supports every effort towards global peace and security and will continue to support the efforts of the United Nations, NATO and other actors to promote peace, stability and security around the world.Global peace and security continue to be challenged by tyranny and oppression in various parts of the world. We reiterate our strong condemnation of the ferocious repression of the freedom-loving people of Syria, whose blood is being shed through the primitive attacks on the part of a regime that has irretrievably forfeited its legitimate right to lead and represent the Syrian people. Let me join all those calling on the Security Council to step up and comply with its duty, as mandated in the United Nations Charter, to preserve peace and security. It is hard to believe that one can remain indifferent to events such as the terrible ones that have been unfolding every day in Syria for a year and a half, with tens of thousands of human losses and the widespread, deliberate destruction and suffering that have already set the country back by decades.Have we not already learned the hard lessons of similar mistakes in the past tragedies in Rwanda and Bosnia?Albania fully supports the peace process between Palestine and Israel. Albania reiterates its position in support of the two-State solution: a secure State of Israel and a viable State of Palestine, living side by side with each other in accordance with United Nations resolutions and the road map. The peoples of both Palestine and Israel are exhausted by that never-ending conflict, and their leaders should shoulder the responsibility of undertaking a legitimate quest for freedom and peace, with long-term vision and goodwill, and against extremists. The world longs to see the peace process in the Middle East shift from a 11the international law. Just a few days ago, the Republic of Kosovo reached another level of State consolidation with the end of the phase of independence supervised by the international community.I take this opportunity to congratulate the authorities of Kosovo on their continued progress in building and strengthening a democratic State and a multi-ethnic society, and I call on all those countries that have not yet recognized Kosovo to consider a review and assessment of that irreversible reality in the South-eastern European region. The recognition of Kosovo is an act of justice for a people that has suffered for too long, and represents a net contribution to peace and stability in the Balkans.We have already heard, and we are prepared to listen once again to the same old redundant arguments from Serbia regarding Kosovo. What war failed to do, propaganda will not achieve either. While Serbias leaders speak of partition and the redrawing of borders, and while they make troubling statements denying genocide in Srebrenica, one is right to ask whether the past continues to loom over the present there, obscuring reality and distorting their vision of the future.Albania has maintained strong positive economic growth despite the impact of the global financial and economic crisis. The pursuit of macroprudential policies and well-anchored structural reforms focusing on privatization, fiscal probity, trade liberalization, the business climate and the energy and financial sectors have enabled Albanias economy to become the most resilient of the economies of South-east Europe. During the period from 2007 to 2012, average economic growth has been 5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), peaking in 2008 at 8 per cent of GDP. Since 2008, Albania has had a f lat tax of 10 per cent; corporate tax has decreased from 25 per cent to 10 per cent; personal income tax has dropped from 23 per cent to 10 per cent; and dozens of fees have simply been eliminated. The Global Competitiveness Report 2011-2012, published by the World Economic Forum, ranks Albania seventy-eighth out of 142 countrieeconomies. The World Bank report Doing Business 2012: Doing Business in a More Transparent World ranks Albania eighty-second out of 183 economies in terms of ease of doing business. In the areas of getting credit and of protecting investors, Albania ranks twenty-fourth pattern of stagnation and become an inspiring example of difficult yet indispensable compromises.Albania remains deeply worried by the Iranian nuclear programme, which continues to raise serious questions as to its nature instead of providing answers and guarantees, as requested over the years. We must prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear threat.In November this year, my country will celebrate the centenary of its independence. We will commemorate a century that saw a diversity of events, which were not always among the happiest ones.Many have described the Albanian people as survivors of harsh chapters of history. They are not wrong: the Albanian people have suffered unwanted wars, forced movement from their lands, assaults and attempts to annihilate them, unjust partitions and, during the second half of the twentieth century, bravely resisted five decades of communism. All this has come at a stiff price. Today we look to the future with hope, in a spirit of deliverance, and with strong confidence that the coming century will be marked by continuous peace, economic progress, and cultural and intellectual revitalization.Our region, which was once a troubled hotspot and a sick area of Europe, has been profoundly and positively transformed. Six new States have been born out of the former Yugoslavia in the course of the past two decades.We all know that it has not been easy, and we all know why. But what matters most is that everywhere in the region societies have evolved, the ghosts of the past have ceded their place to new realities, and people, in particular the young generation, are more than ever turned towards the future.Let me point out here that the establishment of the independent State of Kosovo five years ago has become an important factor of peace and stability in the South-east European region. It has become stronger and overcome all kinds of obstacles created by those who still cannot accept reality and face the truth. As time passes, independent Kosovo is being recognized and accepted by an increasing number of States — close to half of the States Members of the United Nations.The advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on Kosovo (see ), rendered in 2010 upon specific request from Serbia, clearly ruled that the independence of Kosovo was in conformity with 12 President El-Magariaf (spoke in Arabic; English text provided by the delegation): At the outset, I am pleased to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremic on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I would like to commend Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for his leadership as President at the sixty-sixth session. I also wish to express our profound gratitude and appreciation to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his valuable efforts to achieve the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.Three years ago, a despot who ruled my country for 42 years with tyranny and oppression stood at this very rostrum and tore up a copy of the Charter, saying that he did not recognize the authority of the document. Today, I am standing on the very same rostrum to assure the Assembly of my delegations support and respect for the Charter.Today, I stand before the Assembly and the whole world to apologize for all the harm and the crimes committed by that despot against so many innocent people, as well as to apologize for the extortion and terrorism he inflicted on so many States. I want to assure the Organization that the Libyan people are determined to build a State that respects its neighbours, its international obligations and human rights, and that believes that genuine peace in the world will not be realized unless the conscience of every individual is brimming with peace. Libya will be a land of peace and security and a strong force for peace.I am speaking today before this international gathering to convey the greetings of the Libyan people, whose revolt on 17 February 2011 turned into a comprehensive, explosive revolution that shook the very foundations of the regime of the despot Muammar Al-Qadhafi, who declared that he would burn and destroy Libya and make it swim in a sea of blood. He killed thousands of civilians, recruited mercenaries from everywhere, assaulted peoples honour, ordered his militias and mercenaries to rape minors, and destroyed cities. However, our people did not kneel; they did not back down. Thousands of martyrs were lost among the wounded and missing. The price of freedom was paid in blood, lives, amputated limbs and lost youth.In this forum, on behalf of the Libyan people, I salute the United Nations system, which stood with our people, with the will of freedom against blood lust and annihilation, and adopted Security Council resolutions and sixteenth, respectively, putting it among the top reformer countries.On our road towards sustained development, progress and prosperity, we remain fully engaged and committed to carrying out all reforms and taking all of the measures required to continue successfully on the path to European Union integration. This is not an alternative but a long-term choice carefully pursued over the years, and we are determined to make it happen.In the weeks ahead, we expect a favourable decision by the Council of Ministers of the European Union on our bid for the status of candidate country to the European Union. That merit-based decision will constitute another milestone in Albanias journey to European integration and will place our commitments and our responsibilities at a higher stage of the process.In conclusion, let me assure the Assembly that Albania remains committed to international cooperation and is determined to continue to offer its contribution to advancing peace, freedom and security, and respect for human rights, fighting poverty, promoting sustainable development and prosperity, and, last but not least, protecting the environment."}}
