{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, I would like to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremic on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I am confident that his experience in international affairs will enable him to guide the work of this session wisely and ably, and I wish him every success in his task.I would also like to commend his predecessor, Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his successful and prudent leadership of the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly, and to commend the great efforts made by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and pay tribute to his tireless efforts and the role of this international Organization in promoting international peace, security and development.Security and stability in the Arab Gulf region are a high priority for all of us. Our balanced policies are based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the provisions of international law, especially those calling for peaceful coexistence, confidence-building, good neighbourliness, mutual respect, non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, and pursuing peaceful means in resolving conflicts and disputes.On the basis of those principles, my Government expresses, once again, its regret regarding the continued Iranian occupation of our three islands: Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb. We demand the restoration of the United Arab Emirates full sovereignty over those islands. We emphasize that all actions and measures taken by Iran are null and void, and are in contravention of international law and all norms and universal human values.The events unfolding in Syria are for us a cause for great sadness. They have gone beyond all limits and norms. The United Arab Emirates is closely, and with great concern, following the policies of violence, killing, displacement and expulsion being pursued by the Syrian regime against its people, which regime has lost all its legitimacy. We therefore call upon the international community to consider with seriousness and firmness what is happening to our Syrian brothers and to shoulder its humanitarian responsibilities. We see it as our duty to stop those atrocities against the peaceful Syrian people. We are convinced that a Climate Change and effective implementation of the globally agreed outcomes. Sweden calls on everyone in this Hall to do their utmost to contribute to ensuring that that occurs, and developed nations should take the lead.There are severe challenges, but there are also great opportunities. Technology brings new possibilities — to reduce emissions, increase growth, and move towards a truly sustainable future. As the current Chair of the Arctic Council — comprising the eight nations whose landmass extends beyond the Arctic Circle — Sweden will make its contribution. Together, we will set an example of positive cooperation in an area drawing rapidly increasing global attention and where, not long ago, many were predicting competition and conflict.We live in a new era. What happens in the Levant, the Arctic or elsewhere has immediate implications for us all. In order to deal with the challenges of this era, the connected nations of this world need a strong United Nations — a United Nations to discuss the issues of today and to truly seize the opportunities for collective action in order to shape a better tomorrow; a United Nations where we convene in these days to say that, while ridiculing what by others is held sacred is mean and offensive, it can never be used as an excuse for violence, destruction and death.But the United Nations — our United Nations — needs to step up to the challenge. The Security Council must assume its responsibilities, in Syria and elsewhere. Member States must empower the United Nations to become better at conflict prevention and peacebuilding, and ensure that it can deliver development results effectively and as one.It is up to us, the Member States, to meet our international human rights obligations, not just in order to protect the individual human being, but because respect for human rights is also, as we have bitterly learned throughout history, critical to peace and security.In these times of accelerating global change, with its great risks and even greater opportunities, Sweden will remain a steadfast member of this global Organization and, together with our partners in the European Union, we will continue to promote an effective multilateral system with the United Nations at its core."}}
