{"speech":{"0":" You now preside, Sir, over a forum for every voice — an Assembly of all people and nations, one for no country or bloc to dominate solely or lead as one alone, where small and medium-sized countries are truly heard. Australia warmly welcomes your election. The story of the United Nations is truly global, encompassing all the people of the world. It is a story of the progress of small and medium-sized countries, not just of great Powers. It is a story of reconstruction after world war and of the resettlement of massing millions, of navigating the winds of change and of the end of colonialism, bringing self-determination to the worlds great majority, the billions of the global South. It is the story of harnessing new sources of wealth and new 57that guarantees development. New, clean sources of energy deliver a new source of economic growth.Australia is one of the worlds most successful multicultural and multi-faith nations. The Australian experience proves a deeply important fact. There is nothing natural or inevitable about violent conflict over religious belief. We must reaffirm that again today. The denigration of religious beliefs is never acceptable. Australia seeks to be an example of freedom for all faiths, and we support that in the wider world. However, our tolerance must never extend to tolerating religious hatred and incitement to violence. Whether such attitudes lead to attacks against members of religious minorities or diplomats or to attacks against houses of worship or diplomatic missions, the perpetrators of all such violence must be brought to justice and all such incitement must be condemned. Australia condemns violence and we work for peace. We proudly do our full part in the work of the United Nations for peace and security. We stringently observe Security Council resolutions aimed at curtailing weapons proliferation activities, like those of North Korea. We take the leading role in the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste. We lead the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, which operates with the United Nations endorsement. And we have been the largest non-NATO contributor to the United Nations-mandated International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. Australia will bring that record of service to the international community to our service on the Security Council, should we have the privilege to be elected by the United Nations membership in October. There and beyond, our work and the work of every nation for peace must continue. As we meet, the Syrian Government is turning the instruments of State power against the very people whom State power ought to protect, employing heavy weapons and ground-attack aircraft against civilians and engaging in systematic human rights abuses. Syrias neighbours — in particular Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq — are burdened by growing numbers of refugees and are delivering vital help to desperate people. The United Nations has done important work already. Australia is doing its part to help through humanitarian aid. We must do everything we can to end the suffering of the Syrian people and to rebuild Syrian society. Those who are committing crimes against We will help increase gender equality. I am proud to announce that at the Pacific Islands Forum Australia said that it would work alongside our partners in the Pacific on an unprecedented gender initiative: Pacific Women Shaping Pacific Development. Australia will provide $320 million over 10 years to support womens political participation, to expand womens leadership and to spread economic and social opportunities in the Pacific. That is a principle underpinning every Australian aid intervention and initiative: empowering women and girls.We will help fight drug-resistant malaria. The Secretary-General has made malaria one of his key priorities for his second term. It is a priority we share. Since 2000, the world has cut the number of deaths from malaria by 26 per cent. Without those advances, 330,000 more people would have died of malaria last year, the great majority of them in Africa. But malaria itself is fighting back. New drug resistance in malaria must be overcome. Later this year, Australia will hold the Malaria 2012 meeting, bringing together political leaders, civil society and the private sector to accelerate efforts to control and eliminate malaria and combat growing drug resistance.While we are working hard to realize the MDGs in the next three years, Australia is looking further ahead. The year 2015 is a goal, but it is not a destination. Rather, it must be a new point of departure for much new work. Australia pledges to contribute to the important work of the high-level panel on the post-2015 development agenda.Australia brings considerable national experience in working with conflict-affected States and least developed countries, especially in our own region. We will seek to apply what we have learned in our work since 2000 to the worlds plans for beyond 2015. First, peace is an essential foundation to development, and building peace is vital to the progress of societies recovering from conflict. Peacekeepers today must be peacebuilders, not just stopping conflict but enabling development. Secondly, there can be no poverty alleviation without the creation of wealth and jobs. Growth alone is never sufficient; but to achieve development in the interests of all people we must create jobs and wealth. Thirdly, we cannot make poverty history unless we also consign to history the argument that environmental protection and human development are conflicting global goals. Climate change threatens the security of the food supply 58 a historic commitment in Australian policy, and it will endure. We urge a return to direct negotiations and that those negotiations be between the two parties. That is the only durable basis for achieving a two-State solution. The present impasse must be overcome. Both sides need to make compromises and avoid provocations. It will take sacrifice on both sides to settle complex and difficult issues such as settlements, borders, security and Jerusalem. The Israeli and Palestinian people deserve no less.Australias ideals in the world are those of the United Nations, and Australians know the practical value of the United Nations work. That is why Australia seeks to serve in all the work of the United Nations and on the Security Council. We are a strong democracy, welcoming all the peoples, languages and religions of the world. We are a country of the Asia-Pacific, a neighbour to developing countries, with a perspective of both the North and South. We are a State with a decades-long tradition of capable and committed work in the United Nations. We contributed to the first United Nations peacekeeping force in 1947, and we lead contemporary peacebuilding in our own region.We support the development of new norms to enable the United Nations and its States Members to act to prevent atrocities and to make the perpetrators of the worst crimes accountable for them. We act as a first responder to humanitarian need, as a donor who stays the course and as a partner in rebuilding after conflict. Australia embraces the high ideals of the United Nations and takes a practical approach to achieving change. The work of the United Nations is a historic task in which Australia wholeheartedly joins."}}
