{"speech":{"0":" It is always a very significant moment for the delegation of Burkina Faso when we find ourselves present at this traditional meeting that opens the annual session of the General Assembly. For us, it is a special moment for reflection on how the world is progressing and for sketching ways to build a world of peace, security and solidarity. The sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly is taking place in an atmosphere of uncertainty related to the very difficult international economic situation and the growing threats to international peace and security. The challenges that the situation poses to world require of us greater courage, effort, creativity and solidarity, if all of us wish one day to achieve the objectives of peace and development so dear to the international community.This year, Burkina Faso has been tested by a food crisis resulting from poor rainfall. The grain and cereal shortage was exacerbated by a massive inflow of tens of thousands of refugees from neighbouring Mali, sometimes with all of their cattle, as a result of the crisis that has raged in that brother country since 17 January. The situation has led the Government of Burkina Faso to undertake vigorous and urgent measures that have 45the fundamental freedoms of their fellow citizens and to clearly distance themselves from extremist and terrorist movements in order to promote the values of dialogue and democracy to which Mali is so wedded.The crisis situation in the north of Mali is a tangible manifestation of the type of threat facing all of the countries of the Sahel region. I therefore welcome the timely initiative of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that brought us together on 26 September on the margins of the General Assembly around the issue of peace, security and development in the States of the Sahel region. I renew my gratitude and reiterate to him the regard and appreciation of the Government of Burkina Faso for his availability and commitment to peace and development in Africa and throughout the world.Always working for international peace and security, Burkina Faso contributes to peacekeeping operations in Darfur and Guinea-Bissau. On Guinea-Bissau, Burkina Faso encourages the efforts undertaken by the transitional bodies to quickly restore constitutional order and urges all of the countrys stakeholders to ensure a consensual and inclusive transition and to create the best possible conditions in which to implement priority reforms, organize free and transparent presidential elections and entrench the rule of law. On Darfur, we encourage the parties to better implement the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur, and we continue to contribute through the implementation and follow-up mechanism provided for by the Doha Document. On the issue of the Western Sahara, Burkina Faso welcomes the determination of the parties to explore appropriate ways and means to achieve a fair and agreed political settlement of the issue. The current status quo is neither viable nor of benefit to any of the parties, given its impact on the subregions peace and security. That is why my country has continuously promoted dialogue and compromise aimed at achieving an acceptable political solution between the parties. In that regard, we believe that the Moroccan initiative for the negotiation of an autonomous status for the Saharan region could be an appropriate way to settle differences.The world is experiencing great uncertainty and anxiety as a result of the international economic and financial instability, the increase in poverty, ongoing environmental degradation and the increase in natural disasters. In particular, the recent international financial crises, which seriously compromised the balance of very grateful to President Vuk Jeremic for having placed this session of the General Assembly under the banner, “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means”. That theme underscores the importance of resorting to peaceful means as an appropriate mechanism for the settlement of disputes. Burkina Faso fully associates itself with the choice of that topic which, following on the sixty-sixth session, will enable the international community to deepen its thinking and commit itself resolutely to the peaceful settlement of conflicts through dialogue to avoid stalemate and the escalation of violence, which reduces to nought our efforts aimed at promoting sustainable economic and social development.It is along those lines that the President of Burkina Faso has accepted the mediation mission that its peers from the Economic Community of West African States have entrusted him within the framework of the crisis in Mali. The ECOWAS mediation, whose goal is to resolve, through dialogue, the dual institutional and security crisis that is raging in Mali, has focused its efforts on restoring the normal constitutional order and to setting up stable transition bodies that are accepted by Malians and recognized by the international community in order to implement the road map contained in the framework agreement of 6 April, which deals with the management of the crisis and the organization of elections. Burkina Faso will continue to work under the ECOWAS framework, with the support of the international community, towards Malis reunification and reconciliation so as to create conditions conducive to the holding of free and democratic elections throughout all of Mali. The establishment of stable and lasting peace in Mali will require a comprehensive approach combining political dialogue and the use of force mainly aimed at neutralizing extremist terrorist groups of a transnational nature, whose presence in the north of Mali is likely to irretrievably compromise efforts aimed at better governance and social and economic development. The President of Burkina Faso, with the assistance of President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, will continue in a clear-headed way to seek solutions to the deep-rooted causes of the crisis undermining our subregion, a crisis which the armed rebellion has but exacerbated. I therefore call upon the Malian armed movements to renounce the systematic use of arms as a means to achieve their demands. I urge them to respect 46 through a reform of the United Nations. Such reform remains a topic of great concern at the very heart of global governance. We hope that the negotiations launched within the framework of this reform will result in acceptable compromises that can strengthen the effectiveness and standing of the United Nations as it faces the new challenges of our changing world. Only in that way will we genuinely move towards building a more fair and united world.My delegation listened with great interest to the inaugural address by the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, in which he covered all the major issues of concern to todays democratic societies. I would therefore like to congratulate him on his election and welcome the vision with which he would like to endow our common Organization. He can rest assured of our delegations readiness for full cooperation.Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser of Qatar, for his efforts during the sixty-sixth session of the Assembly. That sessions very welcome results bear witness to the skill and effectiveness with which he led our work."}}
