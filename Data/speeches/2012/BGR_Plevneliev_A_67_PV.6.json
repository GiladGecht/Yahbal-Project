{"speech":{"0":" It is a great honour for me to speak from this rostrum for the first time since I took office in January. I would like to congratulate President Jeremic on assuming the chair of this highly representative body and wish him success in his challenging task. I also wish to commend the work of his predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. Let me express our gratitude and appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his inspiring vision, reform efforts and result-oriented action. I also wish to welcome the appointment of Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden as Deputy Secretary-General.Our time is marked by historic shifts and by achievements in science, technology and communications that shape the global economy and is a phenomenon that we have seen lately and which has regrettably led to the killing of innocent people.We have called and we continue to call for dialogue in order to exchange information and experience. We have called and continue to call for dialogue among civilizations and religions. We have established the Doha International Centre for Interfaith Dialogue. We have called and still call for dialogue aimed at acquainting ourselves with ideas and experiences from all over the globe and to learn about different faiths in order to ensure that human culture is interconnected and everyone has a say in its creation. Everyone should reap its dividends, based on understanding, appreciation, knowledge and the full exercise of rights.I have on previous occasions reiterated the importance of that question and the need to strike a balance between respect for sacred faiths and religions and freedom of expression in order for tolerance to replace intolerance and acceptance of the other to replace rejection and stereotyping, which is neither fair nor right. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to call on the United Nations, those who exercise wisdom and reason and those who have decision-making power at the international level to drsft internationally agreed laws, procedures and controls aimed at preventing religions and faiths from being insulted under any pretext and, at the same time, upholding the right of mankind to know and express its opinions.Ms. Flores (Honduras), Vice-President, took the Chair.One of the great challenges that we must face is the question of climate change and its terrible and destructive consequences for all countries. This requires us to cooperate and work together to reach the best solutions to that challenge and overcome our differences.I would like to note that the State of Qatar will host the eighteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The importance of this conference is that it could produce a road map that could help us deal with the negative effects of this phenomenon. I would like take the opportunity of speaking in this international forum to invite all countries of the world to participate in the conference so that we may reach an international consensus on the matter. 31Damascus has lost all legitimacy by waging a reckless war on its own people and refusing to heed the calls for a negotiated way out of the crisis. Due to the growing number of refugees, the humanitarian situation is deteriorating day by day and the stability of neighbouring countries is also at risk. Bulgaria condemns these gross violations of basic United Nations principles and of international humanitarian law. We call for full accountability on the part of the perpetrators, including by bringing them before the International Criminal Court. My country subscribes to the acts of solidarity undertaken by the European Union and its members in providing relief to the suffering civilian population through emergency humanitarian assistance.It is regrettable that the active involvement of the United Nations and the international community has so far failed to ensure the Syrian authorities compliance with the peace proposals elaborated through international mediation. Bulgaria gave its full support to the diplomatic efforts of Mr. Kofi Annan and welcomed the appointment of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi as Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria. While the violence and bloodshed should be stopped immediately, we also call for the start of a transition towards inclusive and representative democratic rule in Syria, one that guarantees the rights of all citizens regardless of ethnicity or religion. Bulgaria has supported the Syrian opposition groups in their efforts to unite on an alternative to the current regime, on the basis of the vision of a new democratic State that can be a home that welcomes all Syrians.The promotion of just, inclusive and transparent societies supports the process of democratic transition, known as the Arab Spring, that has swept across the Middle East and North Africa. Bulgaria welcomes the steps taken by several countries on the path to constitutional and political reform, and we trust that those are now irreversible.At the same time, the need to reactivate the Middle East peace process seems now more pressing than ever. Bulgaria looks forward to the resumption in good faith of direct negotiations and expects both parties to demonstrate their continued commitment to a peaceful solution that respects the legitimate interests and sensitivities of the Israeli and Palestinian people. All efforts should made to create an environment conducive to a comprehensive peace settlement between the two States, a two-State solution. In that respect, we urge politics but that, we should also bear in mind, have an impact on every human being. More and more nations around the world have now opted for open, free and democratic societies based on the rule of law and good governance. But such historic transformations do not always bring more peace and stability. On many occasions we still face extreme violence and bloodshed, causing senseless loss of innocent lives, human suffering and destruction.The main theme of the Assemblys general debate today could not be more relevant for us as political leaders. Dealing with violent conflicts and promoting peace, security, development and human rights have always been at the core of the United Nations. At yesterdays High-level Meeting, we affirmed our credo that the rule of law forms the basis of a peaceful and predictable system of international relations. Nowadays, as conflicts have become more complex, we share the view that mediation and good offices should be the tools of preference for dealing with escalating tension.Delivering justice is vital to addressing terrorism, one of the ugliest and most despicable crimes against humanity. No cause whatsoever can justify the indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians. Sadly enough, no country or human being today can feel safe or insured against this evil. Just a few weeks ago, at the Sofia synagogue, we paid tribute to the memory of five Israeli citizens and one Bulgarian who lost their lives in the shocking terrorist attack last July at the airport of Sarafovo, a lively tourist destination on our Black Sea coast. From this high stage today in New York, a few miles from the September 11 memorial, I now reaffirm our strongest condemnation of that awful crime. My country will spare no effort to bring the perpetrators and masterminds to justice. That attack on our own soil has made us stronger and more determined to align with others in implementing the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.We condemn the violent acts committed recently in the name of defending religious beliefs. This is unacceptable. We urge all involved to show tolerance and avoid provocative actions that can be destructive to peace and stability.For more than a year now the continuing brutal violence in Syria has provoked our extreme concern. Each day brings testimony of unacceptable levels of bloodshed and human suffering. The regime in 32 a year ago, Bulgaria initiated an international forum called the Sofia Platform , providing a useful venue for dialogue and an exchange of views and best practices among countries in the region. We got experts, officials and representatives from Governments, non-governmental organizations and civil societies all over the world focusing on the transition processes in Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Middle East. The forum showed that although the historical, cultural and political realities vary in different countries and regions, conclusions and lessons learned can be relevant in the field of national reconciliation, rule of law, institution-building and security sector reform.Bulgaria maintains its unwavering commitment to the process of European Union (EU) enlargement, involving all our neighbouring countries of South-Eastern Europe and the Balkans. We confirm our conviction that all States of the region should one day become part of the European Union, on the basis of their own merits and criteria fulfilled in the negotiation process. At the same time, pursuing the national reform agendas, solving outstanding issues and building regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations, in accordance with the European standards, is of direct benefit to all countries of the region and their European perspective. All of us in South-Eastern Europe are interested in promoting business and human contacts with our neighbours, developing cross-border projects and facilitating travel, building railways and highways, and developing communications and regional energy and transport infrastructure facilities — all as part of the pan-European networks. That is why we need to make the best use of existing regional bodies, such as the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and the South-Eastern European Cooperation Process with its Regional Cooperation Council.A few months ago, at the Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable Development, we made a good start on the path to a greener and safer world. The outcome documents indicate that sustainable development is the only possible way forward. The triple-win policies envisaged in the outcome document, “The future we want” (resolution , annex) seek to advance social development, economic growth and environmental sustainability, all at the same time. Our task now is to focus on the Conference follow-up and to deliver. The General Assembly should discuss the formulation of sustainable development goals to be integrated into the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015. We see an important role for the Economic and both the Palestinians and the Israelis to refrain from any unilateral actions that could be destructive to the peace process.Disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are areas that continue to demand strong political will and action by the international community. It is essential that we continue to strengthen the comprehensive regime of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and of other major international instruments, such as the Chemical Weapons Convention. With regard to conventional arms, Bulgaria consistently supports the negotiation process leading to the adoption of a legally binding arms trade treaty that is robust in substance.Along with others, we believe that Irans full cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency is of paramount importance. The Government in Tehran must show greater transparency of its nuclear activities and fully comply with all relevant Security Council resolutions. We look to a resumption of the high-level negotiations on the future of Irans nuclear programme and a clear demonstration of political will by the Iranian authorities to undertake concrete confidence-building steps and address the concerns of the international community.Bulgaria highly values the role of the Human Rights Council as the primary United Nations body for the protection and promotion of human rights. I am delighted to announce that my country will be seeking, for the first time, election to the Council for the period 2019 to 2021.Over the past two decades, Bulgaria has gone through a successful transition from totalitarian rule to a functioning democracy with an open market economy and a vibrant civil society. It has been a difficult, dramatic and sometimes turbulent journey. I think our greatest achievement in this process was to have preserved the long-standing tradition of tolerance and dialogue between ethnic and religious communities within Bulgarian society. That tradition can be clearly illustrated by a glimpse of the centre of our capital, where four temples of different religions — Islam, Judaism and Catholic and Orthodox Christianity — coexist peacefully, surrounded by archaeological monuments of several ancient civilizations.It is in this spirit that we stand ready to share the experience from our road to democracy with other countries undergoing similar challenges.
