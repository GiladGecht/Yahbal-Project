{"speech":{"0":" It gives me pleasure to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremic on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I am confident that he will successfully manage the session thanks to his competence and his rich and long experience in diplomacy in the service of his friendly country, the Republic of Serbia. I also express our great appreciation for the President of the Assembly at its last session, Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser of the fraternal State of Qatar, and thank him for the vital role he played, the constructive issues he advanced and his excellent management of the work of the sixty-sixth session. We are proud of him as a seasoned diplomat from a State member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, and wish him every success in his future endeavours.Let me also express our great appreciation for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and thank him for the strenuous efforts he has made to enhance the effective role of the Organization in various fields. We look forward to a renewed role for the United Nations compatible with the Secretary-Generals new vision so that the Organization will be able to address the major challenges before it.Since joining the United Nations, the Kingdom of Bahrain has worked tirelessly to promote the noble purposes and principles of the United Nations, in particular, the maintenance of peace and security and the development of cooperation and friendly relations among nations on the basis of mutual respect. Guided by full respect for those principles, I am honoured to represent a country that acts upon its international commitments and has laid the foundations of a modern State through initiatives, planning and political and organizational vision. We seek to build a modern society that is well organized and committed to its values in various fields, notably education, health, employment, vocational training, economic reform and the advancement of women. Our country, Bahrain, has opted for dialogue as an approach to all its modernization efforts aimed at meeting the requirements of its long history. We 32 the international community. The Kingdom of Bahrain believes that it is imperative to redouble efforts towards a just, durable and comprehensive solution, notably through the creation of an independent Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, in conformity with the relevant United Nations resolutions, the Arab Peace Initiative and the decisions of the international Quartet. We are extremely concerned at attempts to violate the sanctity of the holy sites in Al-Quds Al-Sharif and the attempts to alter their identity. We call on the international community to support Mahmoud Abbas, President of the State of Palestine, who is striving relentlessly to defend the cause of his occupied country and to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the region. We therefore urge the international community to demand that Israel cease its settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories and dismantle settlements that jeopardize the chances for peace. We also stress the need to implement the relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions by putting an end to ongoing Israeli violations and aggression, and to ensure the principles of international legitimacy, notably the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, which prohibits any geographical or demographic alteration in occupied territories. We look forward to peace in our region, which would serve the interests of all its peoples.One tenet of our foreign policy is to enhance peace and security in the region. In that regard, Bahrain reaffirms its unflinching position in favour of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. That will be possible only by compelling Israel to implement relevant international resolutions, to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and to subject its nuclear facilities to the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Moreover, we stress that the Islamic Republic of Iran must fulfil its commitments in full and transparent cooperation with the IAEA. Indeed, nuclear weapons constitute a serious threat to peace and security in the entire region, and various parties must therefore assume their responsibility for peace and security and refrain from the language of intimidation, threats and counter-threats that have recently dominated our region.In that regard, we stress the importance of an excellent preparation process for the 2012 conference to be held pursuant to the agreement reached in the Final Document of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation Al-Saud, to move from cooperation to union as a means of addressing those challenges and threats and building capacities to achieve a Gulf Cooperation Council society based on a shared vision of the future that responds to the accelerating pace of the world and answers to the aspirations of the peoples of the Gulf region. They are convinced that their interests and gains can be served only through solidarity and unity with a view to preserving national independence and State sovereignty and to meeting the needs arising from the strategic transformations on the regional and international scenes.My country believes that the United Nations has an indispensable role to play in addressing international and regional problems and finding appropriate solutions to them. Our region dearly needs that role to be fulfilled, given the catastrophic and fast-paced developments taking place in Syria. The international community, represented by the United Nations and its organs and bodies entrusted with the maintenance of international peace and security, is called upon to unify its position with a view to putting an end to the humanitarian suffering of the Syrian people and finding a political solution to the crisis that will end the violence and bloodshed, preserve the unity of Syria and the cohesion of its people, and spare the region as a whole serious repercussions that could spill far beyond the borders of Syria. The United Nations must therefore shoulder its responsibilities to protect unarmed civilians without allowing the Organizations procedures and mechanisms to impede its ability to prevent crimes against humanity from being committed. It must set aside narrow geopolitical interests and proceed to attain the supreme goal of protecting civilians in armed conflicts and wars. My Government welcomes the appointment of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi as Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States, and wishes him every success in his endeavours to achieve the legitimate demands of the brotherly Syrian people.On the basis of the same humanitarian principle, we should also stand by the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar in their ordeal and provide them with assistance and support while providing good counsel to the Government of Myanmar in that regard.Although the Syrian crisis is preoccupying the international community today, the Palestinian question remains the core issue for the Arab States and 33the peaceful settlement of the Moroccan Sahara issue pursuant to relevant Security Council resolutions.In regard to the current political developments in Somalia, the Kingdom of Bahrain welcomes the election of Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the new President of the Somali Republic in the context of the transitional process. We call on the international community to offer its support and assistance in the restoration of peace and security in the country and in the preservation of Somalias territorial integrity and political independence. We commend the efforts of the Somali Government, together with the international community, to restore peace, stability and cooperation, particularly in combating piracy in the Horn of Africa.We have recently witnessed ugly insults and denigration addressed to our beloved Prophet Muhammad — peace be upon him, his family and his companions. A typical example of that is the shameful video that the Kingdom of Bahrain condemns in the strongest terms, and which led to violence and destruction around the world. Our concern is compounded by the unjustified aggression perpetrated against the diplomatic mission of the United States of America in Benghazi that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and a number of innocent American diplomats, in f lagrant violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961.In spite of these serious developments and repercussions, we should not let that gloomy scene overshadow the spectacle of the crowds that took to the streets in Libya the following day to condemn that abominable attack on the American mission. We are all responsible, as peoples and nations, to teach each other about respect. We need to redouble our efforts to prevent the recurrence of insults to religions, prophets and other religious symbols as Allah commands us in the Holy Koran: “We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is all-knowing and acquainted” (The Holy Koran, XLIX:13). The Kingdom of Bahrain is among the first to have achieved most of the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) before the prescribed time frame in the fields of education, the empowerment of women, the expansion of social security to vulnerable groups, equal of Nuclear Weapons (NPCONF.20 (Vol. I)). We also reaffirm that the principle of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East in no way precludes the right of all nations to access nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, provided that they do so in full transparency and abide by the IAEA guarantee system.While the States members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have extended their hand to their neighbour, the Islamic Republic of Iran, they have unfortunately found no positive Iranian response that could facilitate confidence-building, peace and security. On the contrary, we have had to endure constant interference in our internal affairs from our neighbour. Recently, Iran has reiterated menacing threats to GCC Member States, in contradiction of the spirit of good-neighbourliness, thus generating tension and distrust in the region. More importantly, the Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms the need, either through direct negotiations or through arbitration by the International Court of Justice, to resolve the problem of the three United Arab Emirates islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb that are occupied by the Islamic Republic of Iran.With regard to the situation in brotherly Yemen, we are aware of the need for a successful transitional period in order to achieve security and stability in the country, in line with the agreement reached within the framework of the GCC initiative and its implementation mechanisms. We welcome the steps taken by Mr. Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour, President of the Republic of Yemen, to launch a national Yemeni dialogue, and we are fully confident of his wise leadership of Yemen during this critical transitional period, so that the aspirations of the Yemeni people can be realized.In that regard, the Kingdom of Bahrain welcomes the convening of the donors conference for Yemen, held in Riyadh and sponsored by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and fully supports the recommendations and conclusions agreed upon with a view to building a brighter future for brotherly Yemen, as well as the outcome of the meeting of the Friends of Yemen, held today in New York.We also reaffirm the unwavering, principled and consistent position of the Kingdom of Bahrain, in solidarity with the Kingdom of Morocco, regarding the preservation of the territorial integrity of Morocco and 34 to achieve the progress, dignity and prosperity to which our peoples aspire."}}
