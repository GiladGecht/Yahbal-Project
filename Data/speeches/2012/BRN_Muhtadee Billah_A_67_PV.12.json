{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of His Majesty the Sultan and the people of Brunei Darussalam, I would like to congratulate our new President, His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremic, 24 Success in those three areas means that our children and grandchildren will live in a world where ordinary people and their families have a real chance to live together in hope and confidence. That is the reason for our satisfaction with the work of the United Nations as a global Organization. In other words, in terms of the fundamental work of the United Nations, we see no need to undertake what our theme here describes as adjustment.Rather, it is in the structure of the Organization that we see a need for some things to be adjusted. The reason appears clear to many of those of us who are small both physically and politically. The current structure appears far too often to be the deep-seated cause of the headline news I referred to. We see it as a twentieth-century structure designed to meet twentieth-century realities. It is personified in the 64 years of suffering by the ordinary people of Palestine, and in all other desperate situations in which the root causes of conflict and confrontation are still buried in the past century.Simply put, that must change. In our globalized world, we are all equally interdependent and equally responsible. But, like many other members in the Assembly, we believe that the current structure does not truly reflect those realities. As such, it needs adjusting so that ancient political fault lines are repaired.The form we hope it will increasingly take should resemble that of some regions today that operate on the basis of consensus, rather than compromise and confrontation. That is what we have accepted in our own region of South-East Asia. It is the spirit behind the present focus of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) on building a peaceful and mutually respectful community of nations, regardless of background, economic resources or national preoccupations.That is why we greatly appreciate the strong support and goodwill that is constantly shown us by our many partners from outside the region. It is also why we in Brunei Darussalam, the smallest of all Member nations, feel honoured and privileged to assume the chairmanship of ASEAN next year. That organization is an association of neighbours that have deliberately chosen to adjust their regions previous identity. Until 45 years ago, ours was one of the most unstable regions on Earth, a confrontation point for the national interests of great Powers and a focal point of the Cold War.the welfare of future generations. I would therefore like to express our deep satisfaction with the work of United Nations agencies and international bodies. We believe they are providing us with the opportunity to move out of nineteenth-century colonialism and twentieth-century national interests. In the spirit of our theme here, they are helping us to adjust to twenty-first century regionalism and eventually, we hope, to successful globalism.I would therefore like to suggest three particular areas we find especially important. In each, we believe that the United Nations is helping to create a world in which the people it represents can look to a better future — one of hope rather than anguish, confidence instead of fear, and trust in the place of despair.The first area is the difficult long-term work being done on sustainable development. We were impressed by the results of the Rio de Janeiro United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, which was held in June and built on 20 years of effort. Sustainable development is now far more than an academic topic; it is firmly part of the United Nations long-term development agenda. Work has moved from theory into many practical ideas, projects and activities.The second area is covered in the United Nations Development Programmes Millennium Development Goals Report 2012. We especially noted the following statements by the Secretary-General in his foreword. The target of reducing extreme poverty by half has been reached five years ahead of the 2015 deadline. The target has been achieved on halving the proportion of people who lack dependable access to improved sources of drinking water. The conditions for more than 200 million people living in slums have been greatly improved. The primary school enrolment of girls has equalled that of boys. There is accelerating progress in reducing child and maternal mortality. We are especially encouraged by his conclusion that the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 is challenging but possible.The third area is the sum of the ongoing efforts of United Nations agencies such as the United Nations Development Programme, UNICEF and the Food and Agriculture Organization, which are operating in almost 150 countries. Their work is both wide-ranging and specific in its emphasis upon the basic components of everyday life for the people we represent. 25Historically and to the present day, they looked to heads of State and Government to provide them, their families, their communities and ultimately their respective nations with leadership and direction that foster that all-important sense of well-being and of feeling secure. Over time, across the world, there has been an increasing sense of impatience and agitation born of a sense of growing global insecurity.Accordingly, the United Nations agenda has expanded its focus to address the multifaceted challenges of food security, climate change, global pandemics and the global economic and financial crisis. We have already witnessed citizens from several nations spring into action with demands for change. Others chose to occupy various spaces in protest. In the light of that reality, many of those here — indeed, many of us as leaders — stand as buffers between apathy and anarchy. The theme for this years session of the Assembly, “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means”, is most appropriate and timely, given current events in a number of countries and regions that pose a threat to international peace and security. It ref lects the call by that young woman, who simply asked her representative to provide for her and hers an environment that is safe and secure. Yet her request is not as simple as it appears.The insecurity, impatience and unease that have emerged worldwide are explosive accelerants. They emerge from the heartbreaking scourge of poverty that was so aptly described by the Jamaican national hero, Marcus Mosiah Garvey, who reminded us that poverty is “a hellish state to be in. It is no virtue. It is a crime. To be poor is to be hungry without possible hope of food; to be sick without hope of medicine; to be tired and sleepy without a place to lay ones head; to be naked without the hope of clothing; to be despised and comfortless”.We must seek to rid ourselves of the conditions that lead to poverty. We must pursue social and economic policies that will ensure social equity and justice for our people and increase their well-being and sense of security. That can be achieved only if we, as Member States, work together in good faith to secure the sustainable future we agreed to at Rio de Janeiro. Let us create the future we want, and let us put our people first.Now, our region has adjusted, and is determined to operate in the interests of its community of 600 million citizens. It will continue to do so not by conflict or confrontation and not by compromising national values, but by peaceful consensus. In the same way, we hope that the structure of the United Nations can be gradually and carefully adjusted.Prince Haji Al-Muhtadee, Crown Prince of Brunei Darussalam, was escorted from the rostrum.Address by Ms. Portia Simpson Miller, Prime Minister of Defence, Development, Information and Sports of Jamaica "}}
