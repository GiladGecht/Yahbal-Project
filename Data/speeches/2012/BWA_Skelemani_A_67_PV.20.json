{"speech":{"0":" Allow me, on behalf of my delegation, to join preceding speakers in expressing our felicitations to Mr. Vuk Jeremic on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. Let me also seize the opportunity to sincerely commend his predecessor, Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, of the State of Qatar, 10 The catalogue of incidents of provocation and blatant acts of aggression against the Republic of South Sudan by the North that has led to instability in that region has been typical of the Sudanese regime for many years.We live in times when our common well-being is seriously compromised by such threats as nuclear proliferation, terrorism, climate change, environmental degradation, underdevelopment and pandemic diseases, coupled with the effects of the global economic and financial crisis and internal conflicts. The resolution of the myriad of challenges and threats confronting mankind requires urgent and concerted action by the international community. Because of its universality, the United Nations commands the requisite legitimacy and moral authority to provide guidance and leadership in addressing those threats and challenges. It is therefore imperative that the United Nations of the twenty-first century respond effectively to present realities and effectively handle future challenges.We believe that the international community should act and speak out strongly and forthrightly against human rights abuses and atrocities wherever and whenever they occur. In that regard, my delegation observes with deep regret that, over the past few months, the world community has watched helplessly and failed hopelessly to intervene as Syria descended into protracted anarchy. In the process, the Syrian people have been subjected to a cycle of violent repression and some of the worst human rights abuses and atrocities known to mankind.Even as we speak, the violent crackdown and bloodshed in that country continue unabated. Al-Assad has displaced more than a million Syrians to satisfy his lust for power. He has caused around 300,000 Syrians to f lee into neighbouring countries because of his criminal acts. He has slaughtered 20,000 of his citizens in order to remain President. He has killed men, women, children and babies to achieve that. The international community has, regrettably, failed to respond collectively. And Syria remains a Member of the United Nations, a body with the expressed objective of defending humankind. That surely cannot be right. Syrias allies in the Security Council and in the region need to be equally condemned.The uprisings in the Middle East, commonly referred to as the Arab Spring, have demonstrated that no amount of force can suppress the will of the people forever. The situation in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt, where the popular will of the people has ushered in democratic dispensations, attests to that.Concerning Libya, which had to engage in an internal conflict to rid itself of a brutal dictator, we commend the Libyan people and their allies in the military coalition that imposed a no-fly zone in order to remove Colonel Al-Qadhafi and his regime.My delegation is of the view that given its mandate to maintain international peace and security, the Security Council should assume the high moral ground in defending the victims of war crimes and crimes against humanity, such as those currently being committed in Syria. The principle of the responsibility to protect, as expressed in Security Council resolution 1674 (2006), should be forcefully applied wherever crimes against humanity occur. In that connection, my delegation condemns in the strongest possible terms the persistent vetoes by China and Russia of successive Security Council resolutions aimed at putting pressure on the Syrian leadership to cease its heinous crimes against its citizens. We therefore call on those members of the Council to live up to their responsibilities, in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. We urge the international community to act swiftly to save the people of Syria from further unwarranted bloodshed.Botswana will continue to sponsor and support the various General Assembly and Human Rights Council resolutions aimed at addressing the situation in Syria, as a practical demonstration of our unwavering commitment towards a resolution of the Syrian crisis. It is for that reason that we join forces with like-minded countries in calling for the situation in Syria to be referred to the International Criminal Court for investigation, so that those responsible for crimes against humanity can be held accountable. Al-Assad and his regime should be removed as soon as possible. We must encourage the opposition to unite and to form a transition administration that we can all recognize.We wish to commend Turkey and the other countries that have taken on the burden of accommodating Syrian refugees, have spoken out against the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Syria and have responded, with others, to the plea of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for contributions. For its part, Botswana has made a modest contribution to UNHCR to help the humanitarian relief efforts for Syrian refugees. 11actions as permitted under any of these freedoms, including freedom of speech, is itself irresponsible.Turning to environmental issues, we note the limited and disappointing progress made at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in addressing sustainable development issues, as has been the case at similar summits in the past. As we all know, the world is facing the twin challenges of scarcity of resources and climate change. Those problems are particularly acute in Africa, owing to the high incidence of poverty there. To respond to those big problems, which clearly need visionary solutions and strong partnerships for sustainability on a scale and with an impact that are unprecedented, my country took the important initiative of hosting in May the Summit for Sustainability in Africa. Participation was at the Head of State level, and included representatives of some of the most influential and significant private-sector stakeholders in the world. The Summit adopted the Gaborone Declaration, which, among other things, provides for policy improvements at both the Government and the private-sector levels, aimed at integrating the value of natural capital development. The Declaration also calls for increased private-sector investment in Africa to help reduce food insecurity, improve livelihoods and increase sustainability. We therefore call on the United Nations system and the international community in general to commit to implementing the Declaration.There are many important and urgent issues affecting developing countries that must be addressed. They include technology transfer, funding and capacity-building in other areas, aimed at enabling such countries to adapt to the requirements of a green economy in the context of sustainable development. In that regard, we urge the developed world to help developing countries to address these critical issues and take accelerated action in order to deal with climate change and its causes in their economies.However, we welcome the agreement to launch an intergovernmental negotiation process that will lead to the adoption of sustainable development goals as part of the post-2015 development agenda, when the implementation process of the Millennium Development Goals will have run its course. My delegation believes that the process for developing sustainable development goals should be synchronized with the 2013 review of the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. We also wish to commend responsible human-rights organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, for the work they do in seeking to safeguard the principles that protect humankind. Their mission — to act as watchdogs in matters of safeguarding human rights — is a very necessary one. Similarly, we commend those humanitarian non-governmental organizations that work tirelessly, with meagre resources and under very difficult circumstances, to bring relief to refugees affected by natural and man-made disasters.Human rights abuses and atrocities are not limited to Syria. It is in that context that we affirm our support for the International Criminal Court and urge it to continue to fulfil its mandate, including prosecuting those indicted for human rights abuses and crimes against humanity. We therefore appeal to States parties to fully cooperate with the Court in its efforts to bring the suspected perpetrators of such crimes to justice.We wish to add our voice in condemning the violence that occurred following the release of a publication that offended people of the Islamic faith. There can be no justification for such a violent response. The violence itself caused offence to its victims. Retaliation against offensive expressions therefore cannot take the form of other offensive actions aimed at innocent parties. However, where democracy is defined as Government of the people, by the people, for the people — in other words, doing what is in the best interests of the people — how can it be in the peoples best interests if freedom of speech results in insults?Other freedoms, in a democratic dispensation, include freedom of association — but we cannot associate with terrorist or criminal groups without consequences, since it is not in the peoples best interests to live among terrorists and criminals. Freedom of expression allows for protests — but only peaceful protests — in democracies, because it is also not in peoples best interests to have violent protests; and in democracies consequences do follow if protests become violent. The same goes for freedom of the press, if it is abused, as it often is. There must be consequences, in order to protect peoples interests from misinformation and attempts to discredit or defame them. With all such freedoms there must be limits. Democracy is supposed to be responsible. Causing offence and insult cannot by any stretch of the imagination be passed off as what we want in a democracy. Trying to justify irresponsible 12 and tourism score high. The design and construction of relevant infrastructure demonstrate Surinames potential to be a player on the supply side of strategic commodities. President Bouterse also presented a social package in which education and health care figure prominently. He made the point that strong international ratings are encouraging indicators for investors. However, the citizens of Suriname who lack the right opportunities will share in the achievements only if the Government is able to present them with a package comprising job-oriented education at an academic as well as a vocational level, adequate health services, sports facilities, access to potable water, information and communications technology facilities and proper waste disposal. The challenge of financing such an improved social package makes it necessary to empower our production and service sectors by providing funds and know-how to our entrepreneurs.Suriname, as a young nation, is experiencing an ongoing decolonization process that involves both its structure and its mindset. Building a nation of half a million people constitutes an enormous challenge when at least seven different ethnic and cultural traditions originate from the Americas, Africa and Europe, while a considerable part of the population traces its roots to India, Indonesia, China and the Middle East. .Suriname is known for the presence of a synagogue located next to a mosque in the heart of the capital Paramaribo, while Christian churches coexist with Hindu temples and places of worship with a strong African affinity. We are proud to state that we have been able to convert that challenge into a unique and exemplary benefit and that the divide-and-rule policy of colonial days is gradually disappearing, making way for mutual respect, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, which redound to the advantage of all our citizens.Suriname is a country blessed with an exuberant array of biodiversity. That splendid gift of the Almighty must be cherished and protected to the fullest extent. It needs to be mapped out in a way that allows for responsible use. The challenge we face is responding to the genuine developmental needs of our people, while at the same time respecting and preserving biodiversity for future generations, and indeed for humankind.My country has committed itself to that cause by, among other actions, creating a nature reserve of 1.8 million hectares. We have accepted the obligation We would like to take this opportunity to commend the work done by environmental organizations worldwide in their efforts to save the planet from climate change and its negative effects.Botswana participated in the ill-fated United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty in July, whose purpose was for Member States to agree on common international standards for regulating the international trade in conventional weapons. We believe that, when adopted, an arms trade treaty will complement the United Nations programme of action for combating the proliferation of arms and ammunition, which continue to cause untold suffering.Before concluding, I wish to state that Botswana fully supports the call for implementing the Assemblys successive resolutions on lifting sanctions against Cuba, something we believe is logical and long overdue."}}
