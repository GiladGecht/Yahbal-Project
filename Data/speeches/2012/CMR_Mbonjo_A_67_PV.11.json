{"speech":{"0":" I speak on behalf of Mr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic of Cameroon, who has had to remain in Cameroon owing to painful circumstances. He asked me to read the following statement.“Allow me, first of all, to warmly congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. The experience he brings as former head of the diplomatic corps of his country leads me to believe that he, like his predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, will lead the discussions with the requisite agility and talent. I would also like to It is important to act quickly, because the composition of the Council is the keystone of our collective security system, and in that light its composition should be designed to maximize efficiency. In order for the Security Council to be truly effective in its decisions, since it devotes two-thirds of its time to the African continent, we consider it more critical than ever for Africa to hold a permanent seat with the right of veto, in accordance with the recommendations defined in the Ezulwini Consensus. Taking duly into account the wishes of African heads of State and Government, the reform of the Security Council could represent a historical opportunity that the international community should seize in order to repair an anomaly in international relations. With that in mind, I hope that the forthcoming negotiations on Security Council reform will be crowned with success, yielding a Council that truly represents the realities of our shared history and our contemporary world.I would like now to make some remarks about the situation in my country. Thanks to the most valuable support of the international community, especially the United Nations, Cote dIvoire has emerged from the military and political crisis that rocked the foundations of its economic and social development for nearly a decade. Resolutely committed to the path of post-conflict reconstruction, and with the aim of national cohesion, Cote dIvoire has made considerable progress in the political, economic, social, security and humanitarian spheres since 21 May 2011, the official date on which President Ouattara assumed the presidency of the Republic. Those results were made possible by the determination of the Ivorian Government to implement the three central priorities defined by the President when he took office. First, on security and stability, significant joint efforts by the Government and the United Nations Operation in Cote dIvoire lead to improvements in the situation, even in the west of the country, which has been the most problematic area. Secondly, national reconciliation has been effected through the National Commission for Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation, which has been serving as the standing body for maintaining political dialogue. Reconstruction and economic renewal are already off to a good start, with an estimated growth of more than 8 per cent in the gross national product for 2012. The economic situation has greatly improved, thanks to the support of our development partners, especially 32 the media than the Rio meeting, that session aimed to curb the excesses of globalization and to refocus it on development. Globalization, because of what it has brought to the development of trade, economic and technological progress and the rapprochement of cultures, can be considered a positive phenomenon. The fact remains, however, that because of poor management and poor regulation, it was unable to prevent economic crises and relegated problems of underdevelopment to the backburner. UNCTAD, after the Doha meeting, was reinforced in its role in terms of trade and development, which is something to be welcomed.“Since 2008, we have seen a slowdown in global economic activity. Industrialized countries, be they European Union or the United States or Japan, have, to varying degrees, been experiencing serious difficulties — slower growth or even recession, increased debt and public deficits, imbalances in foreign trade, and so on. Emerging countries themselves, which had seen high growth rates, have been experiencing a slowdown as well. As to developing countries, even if they continue to make moderate progress, they fear the effects of a crash of the global economy and a possible contagion.“A few moments ago I said that globalization, even if it does have some positive aspects, has not achieved its main objective, that is, ensuring the harmonious functioning of the global economy and global finance while taking into account the interests of all concerned parties. That relative failure has revealed an urgent need for regulation. Right now it is hard to see how and when that need can be met.“Major forums, such as the Group of 20, of which industrialized countries make up the majority, and the World Trade Organization have, for their part, discussed several times the question of the global economy and outlined solutions that could re-establish an overall balance. But it has to be said that, given the scale of the task, the lack of available resources and the difficulties that major countries themselves are having to face, the discussions have not always been followed by action. From that standpoint, the international community seems to be going through a period of doubt and concern. Every one of us is aware that urgent and large-scale action is required, but, preoccupied with our own express to Mr. Al-Nasser my countrys appreciation for his action as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. “Finally, I would like thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his devotion to serving the ideals of the Organization.“This has been an active year for the Organization. We have held major meetings to discuss the important questions of the day and examined the most appropriate course of action to address them. Allow me to return to two of them.“First of all, there is Rio+20, the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, which was held in June 2012 to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the historic Earth Summit. The meeting enabled us to define the future we want to leave our children.“I am pleased that the vision adopted at the end of the meeting recognizes the need to further incorporate at all levels of activities the economic, social and environmental aspects of sustainable development. If we want to leave a liveable world to future generations, the green economy seems the most effective way of ensuring that development meets the needs of populations while at the same time preserving the environment. “For our part, Cameroon has already begun actions in that respect. We intend to work further to preserve our natural capital and to seek low-carbon solutions, as well as to promote production and consumption patterns that are sustainable.“In our view, progress towards the green economy must be gradual and enjoy the support of the international community. In that respect, the document adopted at the end of the Rio Conference committed the international community to upholding the many obligations that had been undertaken with respect to Africa in terms of sustainable development, while ensuring, inter alia, appropriate technology transfer. The international financial institutions and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) are called upon to strengthen their activities to that end. That is a significant step forward.“The second important meeting that we should note is the thirteenth quadrennial session held by UNCTAD in Doha, Qatar. Less commented upon by 33security through the adoption of effective collective measures and the settlement by peaceful means of disputes which could lead to a breakdown of peace, in accordance with the principles of justice and international law. That reminder is not without value at the present moment, when tensions persist in the Sahel, especially in Mali, when the Sudan and South Sudan struggle to normalize relations, and when Syria is ravaged by internal conflict. Those tensions highlight the risk of force being used to resolve differences.“The use of force can be justified in some cases, such as to respond to international terrorism, violations of human rights and democracy, threats to the security of persons or violations of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. However, it is clear that, before resorting to that extreme, peaceful means must first be used to resolve disputes, so as to avoid setting off a vicious circle of violence and retaliation. Far be it from me to indulge in utopianism. There are situations when military intervention is perhaps inevitable. But it is our responsibility to reduce to the minimum the likelihood of military action by taking a maximum of precautions. In any case, clearly the preferred way to settle disputes is still through prevention and negotiation. “For the greater part of international public opinion, the United Nations embodies the noblest human values and the hope for a future in keeping with the ideals of peace, security and development, as enshrined in the United Nations Charter. Let us strive to keep that hope from being yet again betrayed.”"}}
