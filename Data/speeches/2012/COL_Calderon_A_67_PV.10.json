{"speech":{"0":" Two years ago, during my first address before the Assembly as President of Colombia (see ), I expressed my countrys aspiration to become a member of the Security Council for the period 2011-2012.We assumed the responsibility of participating in making decisions about critical situations that threaten world peace in a spirit of absolute independence and well aware of the enormous commitment required to work for international peace and security. It has been a particularly turbulent time, but one during which the aspirations of many peoples who had suffered long conflicts and armed confrontation have been furthered. Countries like Liberia, Sierra Leone and Cote dIvoire are now making strides towards peacebuilding and the rule of law. In Libya, a ruthless tyranny in place for more than 40 years was dismantled in a process in which the Security Council played a decisive role. My Government did not hesitate to condemn the violent repression of the civilian population justly clamouring for the exercise of their fundamental rights. That is why we joined the Councils decisions furthering a transition towards a democracy that, although still fragile, enjoys the support of the international community as it seeks to entrench itself. There are still violent groups that want to sabotage that process by terrorist methods. I take this opportunity to condemn in the strongest terms the despicable attack perpetrated against the United States consulate in Benghazi. Extremism, terrorism and disregard for human life cannot be allowed to persist.Today, the Arab world is experiencing a fundamental political transformation, opening the way towards democracy. If the process is to last, it will require respect for peoples rights and the creation of conditions conducive to sustainable economic development. We hope that participation by citizens, especially women, will continue to increase and foster democratic systems and opportunities for development and welfare.With regard to the dire situation in Syria for more than a year and half, I must express our deep frustration with the inability of the international community to put United Nations asdfGeneral AssemblySixty-seventh session10th plenary meetingWednesday, 26 September 2012, 3 p.m.New YorkOffi cial RecordsPresident: Mr. Jeremic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Serbia)2 an end to the tragedy that every day takes more and more Syrian lives. From this rostrum, we reiterate our call for an end to the attacks and for a political negotiation that will meet the legitimate aspirations of all sectors of Syrian society. Implementing Kofi Annans six-point plan would greatly contribute to facilitating a Syrian-led political transition. We strongly support the new Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, and wish him much success in his very complex and difficult task.As a representative of a country that is currently a member of the Security Council, I would like to briefly turn to the matter of its reform, which has been under discussion for 20 years. Colombia believes that consensus should be our guide in developing a comprehensive approach that includes change in both the Councils composition and its working methods so as to promote more effectively the United Nations goals of peace, well-being and humanity. In our hemisphere, one country that requires comprehensive peacebuilding is Haiti. We continue to work for Haiti. Its recovery will require our continuous support in strengthening its capacities, institutions and productivity so as to generate employment, reduce extreme poverty and promote the United Nations work for development in the country. I urge everyone to persevere in that cause.A key event for the world this year was the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). Inspired by the Millennium Development Goals model, Colombia led the proposal to establish the sustainable development goals, which was the most important outcome of the Rio+20 process. Today, the sustainable development goals promise to be a fundamental component of the planets development agenda, and the Secretary-General himself has identified them as one of the five priorities of his legacy. We are therefore especially pleased that our Foreign Minister has been invited to be a member of the high-level panel on the post-2015 development agenda, which held its first meeting yesterday.This year, the sixth Summit of the Americas gathered in Colombia, with 30 Heads of State and Government from the western hemisphere in attendance. It was a fruitful gathering, which for the first time we organized simultaneously with a business summit attended by the leaders of the premier companies of the Americas. We also held a social forum that brought together people from diverse social organizations on the continents. The Summit of the Americas in Cartagena was characterized by frank and open dialogue about the most crucial issues for the region and the world. The Governments of the Americas agreed to undertake an analysis and discussion of the track record, effectiveness and future prospects of the so-called war on drugs, as well as possible alternatives to it. It is our duty to question with scientific objectivity whether we are doing the best we can or if there are better options to more effectively combating the scourge. To that end, we mandated the Organization of American States to begin an analysis and discussion, inviting other entities — the first of which would be, of course, the United Nations — to participate.That is only a first step, but it is of great importance because it is the beginning of a discussion that the world has avoided for many years. We hope that it will ultimately yield concrete results. The debate about drugs that have caused so much harm throughout the world and to my country must be frank and, most certainly, global. Similarly, in my statement before the General Assembly two years ago, I expressed my conviction that the dawning decade should be the decade of Latin America and the Caribbean — a decade that would consolidate that region of the world as a region of peace, progress and solutions for the rest of the planet. Today, we are pleased to note that our region is indeed experiencing a favourable moment with solid economies, functional democracies and no current conflict among the nations of which it is formed. Regional coordination mechanisms of relatively recent establishment, such as the Union of South American Nations and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, are evidence of the resolve of our countries and peoples to cooperate. I would like to highlight the enormous potential of the Pacific Alliance that was formalized this year among Mexico, Peru, Colombia and Chile. The Alliance is open to the participation of other States with which we seek to strengthen not only trade but also political and human ties, as well as to the nations of the immense Pacific basin.I cannot conclude without referring to the special moment that our country is currently experiencing. Against the backdrop of international turbulence, we 3With regard to my statement today, a few days ago I asked the Colombian people through social media what message they wanted me to bring here to the General Assembly. Among the many messages I received, I want to share one from my compatriot Henry Rodriguez Chacon: “An entire generation wants to wake up one day to the news of a peace agreement.” That is the most heartfelt wish of the Colombian people. Aware that the process must have brief deadlines and precise terms if it is to be successful, I trust that I will be able to deliver to the Assembly next year a positive outcome of the effort, which we undertake enthusiastically with a view to ending our 50-year conflict.We do not want to talk just about peace; we want to build conditions for peace. That is what we are doing on a daily basis with the actions of our Government and now with the talks that we are initiating. Today, with great hope, we present the world with this new special moment for my country, Colombia. "}}
