{"speech":{"0":" Allow me, at the outset, to extend my warmest congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremic, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia, on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I should like to express to him the pleasure of the Union of the Comoros at seeing him preside over our work and to assure him of the full support of the Comorian delegation in discharging his noble task.commitments; and the promotion of mutually beneficial and fair friendship and cooperation relations among States.Those norms are the basis for promoting justice and law in international relations, and no State or group of States should step forward to police their implementation. Such an act usurps the authority of the United Nations and undermines its effectiveness. The United Nations should impose its authority at the international level, avoiding any possible manipulation through external pressure from those that violate the spirit of its principles.Meanwhile, Equatorial Guinea endorses the wishes of the entire African continent to obtain a response to one of its legitimate demands, made on various occasions, namely, Security Council reform by increasing the number of Council members in both categories and reserving two seats as permanent members and five as non-permanent members for the African region. Democratic principles and the law are advocated at the United Nations. Africa claims its rights, including in the Security Council. Africa wishes to participate in the taking of decisions that affect its future.With the assistance of all, we will succeed in adopting appropriate measures to reduce the tendency towards unilateralism and hegemony in international relations. We will succeed in mitigating the effects of policies that threaten the peace and sovereignty of States and that oppose the economic and social development of peoples, thereby significantly violating the principles of international law.With regard to disarmament, which Equatorial Guinea fully supports even though it is neither a manufacturer nor a consumer of any sophisticated weapons of mass destruction, we believe that there should be no ambiguity on that issue. One cannot have the best of both worlds.We do not believe there to be a threat from other planets of the solar system or other bodies in outer space. The possession of nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction is a disgrace to todays humankind, which is preparing its own destruction. So who should arm themselves and who should be disarmed? The end of the Cold War was supposed to also mean the end of the arms race. It is now time for humankind to build its own future instead of wasting resources on extermination plans. 21African Union and the United Nations, to put an end to those violations, which have gone on for much too long.One should not, however, lose sight of the fact that while some advocate fanaticism and extremism, Islamophobia is also taking on alarming proportions. Indeed, the dissemination of the video Innocence of Muslims has led to waves of indignation and many demonstrations throughout the world. Several million believers have felt their faith insulted and harmed.However, the protests against the unspeakable insults to Islam, Muslims and the Prophet Muhammad — peace be upon him — cannot justify the violence against Western missions in many countries. My country therefore condemns the terrorist attacks that in Benghazi, Libya, caused the death of the American Ambassador, Chris Stevens, and a number of his colleagues. I take this opportunity to reiterate to the American people and to the grieving families of the victims the most heartfelt condolences of the people and the Government of the Comoros.The ongoing existence of many hotbeds of tension throughout the world, the violation of fundamental human rights, and the growth of piracy and terrorism all speak to the need for urgent and in-depth reform of the Security Council. My country therefore reiterates its support for the African Unions position regarding the need to reform the Council for better representation of the international community and for greater effectiveness in the settlement and management of conflicts.A few decades ago, my country resolutely committed itself to the path of democracy. It wishes to make its contribution to the promotion of a world of peace, security, justice and fairness. That is why I have committed myself, since my accession to the presidency, to spare no effort in promoting the rule of law and good governance in the Union of the Comoros. Above and beyond the setting up of all institutions provided for under our Constitution, including the Supreme Court, I have given major priority to the fight against corruption. An anti-corruption law has already been promulgated, and a national commission to combat and prevent corruption has now been set up and made operational. I thank the European Union for its assistance and expertise in this area, which enabled us to develop the document for our national strategy to combat corruption.I should also like to pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, former Permanent Representative of the State of Qatar, who presided over the General Assembly with such wisdom, skill and determination and who was successful in working to strengthen its role.Finally, I wish to congratulate the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the vision with which he has led the Organization and for the worthy initiatives he has ceaselessly undertaken to promote respect for the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, especially peacebuilding and stability for greater development.As was the case last year, the General Assembly is meeting in a context of global uncertainty. It is a climate marked by multifaceted crises, all of them major challenges for our institution. It is meeting at a moment when one of the Members of our United Nations family, Syria, is being rent asunder by a steadily deterioraiting fratricidal war, which poses a serious threat to peace both for the region and for the world, due to that countrys strategic geopolitical position. The resignation of the Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and the League of Arab States, former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, demonstrated, were there any need for such, the complexity of managing the Syrian conflict. It therefore behoves us to act without delay to put an end to the terrible suffering of the brotherly Syrian people and to save what can be saved of its various infrastructures.Just as important is the Palestinian cause. For decades now, it has awaited a fair and lasting solution, one found through our shared desire to establish together the solid foundations for a world of peace and prosperity. The Union of the Comoros reiterates its full support for the Palestinian people and associates itself with the formula of a Palestinian State as a full-f ledged member of the community of nations, living side by side and in perfect security with the State of Israel.The situation in northern Mali is also alarming. The attacks carried out against the civilian population of the region, the serious violations of human rights, the obstacles erected to humanitarian access, and the destruction and looting of holy places and other religious, historical and cultural sites are barbarous acts that are contrary to the principles of Islam. That is why my country supports the commitment of the Economic Community of West African States, alongside the 22 adapt to climate change and to make operational the Copenhagen Climate Fund. We need to honour the commitments made to the countries of the South by implementing, inter alia, the agreements on emissions linked to deforestation and forest degradation, as well as a comprehensive agreement on climate change. We must also respect the Kyoto Protocol on the reduction of greenhouses gases within the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Finally, we must do our utmost to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.Faced with all those equally important challenges, I urgently call on the most developed countries to apply to the most fragile countries the same mechanisms that have been implemented to reduce the impact of the crisis in Europe, in order to prevent more unfortunate consequences, knowing that our countries depend on the financial contributions of our people abroad. In that context, my country, which is currently a beneficiary of the Extended Credit Facility of the International Monetary Fund, hopes by December to have reached the completion point of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. In other words, the new world economic order, based on the shared principles of fairness, transparency and prosperity that we have willingly embraced, requires a real and dynamic easing of the crisis that has struck the world. Africa impatiently awaits the advent of that new order to realize economic and social integration and to embark resolutely on the path of sustainable development.In conclusion, with respect to my countrys stability, before the General Assembly, I once again appeal to France that a frank and sincere dialogue finally be set up between our two closely linked nations on the question of the Comorian island of Mayotte. It has grown increasingly clear that the fact that Mayotte remains under French administration constitutes a threat to the peace and stability of the three other Comorian islands — the peace that remains the foundation of freedom and prosperity.It is true, and a secret to no one, that that island has always served as a rear guard for the detractors of the Comoros, those who would prefer not to see our country move forward despite its great potential. Moreover, the year 2012, now drawing to a close, proved particularly dramatic for my people. Men, women and children aboard f limsy boats known as kwassa kwassa perished in the narrow waters that separate the Comorian islands of Anjouan and Mayotte because of the visas that France This year once again, the global economic and financial crisis is at the heart of the Assemblys general debate. That crisis has made evident the urgent need for a global form of economic governance based on the values of responsibility, fairness and solidarity. It has also placed before the eyes of the world the urgency of an in-depth reform of the international financial institutions.The repercussions of the crisis are becoming increasingly palpable, particularly in developing countries, where the rising price of staples threatens peace and stability. The crisis has also intensified problems linked to energy, which powers all socioeconomic development, limiting our ability to promote development through investments.Climate change is another major challenge our countries face. We must respond effectively to that phenomenon, which affects the entire planet, especially small island developing States such as the Union of the Comoros.I wish to stress that last April my country experienced two weeks of unusually violent torrential rains that hammered our islands, causing damage that had disastrous consequences for our population and the national economy. Ten per cent of the population was affected, a high percentage for a country as sparsely populated as the Comoros. In the name of the whole Comorian people and of my Government, I would therefore like to thank all the partners and friends who offered us urgent humanitarian aid to help us address that dramatic situation.The unprecedented storms led my Government to draw up a rapid recovery plan, with the aid and support of the international community. It will enable us to better help those affected and to restore destroyed infrastructure throughout our territory. That plan, which contains procedures aimed at restoring the situation within a period of six to 12 months, was launched at a round table held on 5 September in Pretoria, with the fraternal support of our friendly brother country, the Republic of South Africa. I would therefore like to appeal to all here to help finance the rapid recovery plan, whose cost has been estimated at $18 million. That will allow my country to better face the current situation and to better prepare for the future.The time has come to relaunch with greater determination a number of pending international issues, in particular those regarding measures to mitigate or 23on his election and to wish him much success in the coming year. We also wish to express our appreciation to the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his dedication to the work of the Organization. We especially thank him for his efforts to encourage us all to meet successfully the considerable challenges now being posed by life in the twenty-first century.At the same time, we would also like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his constant willingness to apply the core values of the United Nations directly whenever he has been asked to act on our behalf. We particularly welcome the five-year Action Agenda he has set out and the common vision it offers us. At its heart, the vision is one of tolerance, respect and understanding among nations.Sadly, over the past two weeks, we have witnessed events that present a very different vision. In considering them, Brunei Darussalam has stated its unreserved condemnation of their cause. We have equally strongly advised all our people of our Governments absolute rejection of the violence and extremism that have been their result. Here at the United Nations, we congratulate the Secretary-General on his statement about the matter. In doing so, we reaffirm our commitment to the universal values of tolerance and respect. Similarly, we uphold the institutions, structures and due processes of international affairs that this great Organization embodies.Turning now to the theme for this years general debate — “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means” — for me the key word is “adjustment”. I think it is well chosen. It suggests change that is carefully and gradually done. It does not invite confrontation. For us in Brunei Darussalam, it matches the main purpose of this annual meeting. We see it as an opportunity to express our satisfaction and our concern about how successfully the United Nations is managing the process of globalization that we have nationally embraced.In other words, are we satisfied with things as they are; or do we see a need for some adjustment? In answering that question, we would like to start by expressing considerable satisfaction with many aspects of the Organizations work. The media constantly headline the supposed defects, failures and setbacks of the United Nations. But beneath all of that we observe the enormous contribution of the United Nations to imposed on the Comorians of the other islands. Surely that painful, unacceptable situation, which has lasted for decades, cannot fail to move this worldwide Assembly, whose chosen theme for this year is “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means”, including the rule of law at the national and international levels.I therefore hope that France will honour its commitments as a country that respects international law. Finally, I hope it will respond positively to our urgent call so that together we may find a positive way for Mayotte to return to its natural home, which remains the Union of the Comoros. That is how to put an end to the humanitarian tragedy and to guarantee lasting stability for my country. It is through a definitive solution to this conflict, which has lasted far too long, that France can contribute to the ongoing efforts to enhance regional integration, and thus to safeguard the interests of this region of the Indian Ocean that we hope to build together in stability and peace."}}
