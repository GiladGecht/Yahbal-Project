{"speech":{"0":" I would like to congratulate President Jeremic on his election to serve as the highest representative of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. In recent decades, his country has gone through a difficult period. I am sure his experience as the Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs who saw the consequences of one kind of peacefully negotiated settlement and armed international intervention will benefit this years General Assembly and contribute to making our deliberations less formal and more practical.Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan), Vice-President, took the Chair.The Czech Republic firmly believes that international disputes and conflicts can and should be settled by peaceful, not military, means. We have been systematically demonstrating that for a long time. When the division of Czechoslovakia was taking place 20 years ago and the situation was emotionally strained and painful for us, it never crossed the mind of any of our politicians that the problem should be addressed by any other than peaceful means. The difficult negotiations, undertaken solely by our own representatives, resulted in achieving a settlement that political representatives and, especially, citizens in both the newly established States considered then and still consider to be a positive solution.Our experience affirms that it is the domestic politicians, in particular, who should be the driving 20 leaders in the West, both among politicians and in the media, to confront Islamophobia in all its many forms and manifestations. It is incumbent on us all to advance the cause of dialogue and cooperation, to fight the forces of division and hatred and to fulfil the promise of a better and brighter future for future generations. We must work to defeat the forces that foment conflicts among civilizations, and to support the voices of tolerance and understanding.My country, Afghanistan, is testament to the benefits of multilateral cooperation and international solidarity. It was a little over a decade ago that many countries from around the world joined the Afghan people in our struggle for peace and against the forces of extremism and terrorism. At the time, Afghanistan was a country decimated in every way. For decades we had suffered, unnoticed, from violence, deprivation and sinister foreign intervention. Long before terrorism became a security threat to the whole planet, Afghans were victims of atrocities inflicted by terrorist networks from various parts of the world that had made Afghanistan their haven.Looking back 10 years, Afghanistan has undergone a remarkable transformation. Democracy has taken root; health services are accessible to the majority of the population in every corner of the country; millions of students, boys and girls, are enrolled in primary and higher education. Our achievements have not come about easily, though. The aspirations of the Afghan people for security and peace have yet to be realized. As the global fight against terrorism continues unabated, the Afghan people continue to pay a bigger price than any other nation, in both life and treasure.Terrorism is not rooted in Afghan villages and towns; it never was. Its sources and support networks all exist beyond Afghanistans borders. Thus while the security of the international community is being protected from the threat of terrorism, the people of Afghanistan must no longer be made to pay the price and endure the brunt of the war. It is in deference to the immense sacrifices of the Afghan people, and to the precious lives lost from the international community, that the campaign against terrorism must be taken to the sources of terrorism and be results-oriented.Today in Afghanistan, we are pursuing the cause of peace and an end to violence as a matter of great urgency. Since peace is the greatest desire of the Afghan people, and since we are convinced that military efforts alone are not an adequate strategy for ensuring security, we and promotes their international application. We will support United Nations activities in the fields of disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Those issues are among our security policy priorities. The Czech Republic will continue to take part in United Nations peacekeeping operations, as well as in humanitarian and development programmes. It also supports efforts to reform the United Nations, including the Security Council, which in 2005 began to work towards responding to our changed international environment and promoting a more balanced representation of individual regions and States."}}
