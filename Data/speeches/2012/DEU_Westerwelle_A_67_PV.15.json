{"speech":{"0":" Freedom, dignity, self-determination and the hope of a better life were the driving forces behind the movement for change in the Arab world. As Germans, we know from our own bitter experience that freedom is not a gift. It has to be won and constantly defended. Freedom is more than just freedom of thought. It is freedom to express ones own opinion and to voice public criticism. For that reason alone, freedom is not always comfortable. The first article of the Basic Law, Germanys Constitution, states that human dignity shall be inviolable. That applies to every single individual, regardless of their origin, culture, creed or sex. As Germans, we have experienced what it is to lack freedom in the course of our own history. We will always stand by those who, wherever they are in the world, call for freedom of opinion, religion, the press and artistic freedom.16 All Syrians who want their country to have a democratic and pluralistic future based on the rule of law must work together. We support the efforts of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States, to find a political approach. Despite the escalating violence and despite the deadlock in the Security Council, we must not stop working on a political solution.During the past 20 months, the Arab League has demonstrated ever more clearly its adherence to the values enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. We welcome that and we want to build on it. At Germanys initiative, during the last week in September, the Security Council welcomed intensifying cooperation between the United Nations and the League of Arab States (see PRS). That is an acknowledgement of the Arab Leagues constructive and positive role.We also pay tribute to the efforts to gain freedom in other parts of the world. As a result of the remarkable opening-up process under way in Myanmar, the country is emerging from isolation and gradually leaving repression behind.We criticize and strongly condemn the ongoing repression in our own neighbourhood, in Belarus.In many other Asian and African countries, which have struck out in a new direction, we are supporting political transformation by providing assistance for economic and social development. That is in the common interest of the international community. For there is one thing that becomes ever more apparent, and that is that without development, there can be no security and without security there can be no development. That applies to our engagement in Afghanistan, which we will continue after the withdrawal of combat troops in 2014. It also applies to the efforts to bring stability to Somalia and Yemen, to the Great Lakes region and to the countries of the Sahel.We are very concerned by the still-unresolved dispute about Irans nuclear programme. Iran has still not produced evidence of the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. It has also failed to date to provide the transparency that the International Atomic Energy Agency has long demanded. So far, the talks during the last few months have not made enough progress towards reaching a solution. The European Unions three plus three group has put forward proposals for a substantive negotiation process. We still await a serious response from Iran. We want a political and diplomatic solution. Time is short. Israels security is at stake. Indeed, stability in the entire region is at stake. However, that is also about averting the risk of a nuclear arms race with unforeseeable consequences for international security. I call on Iran to stop playing for time. The situation is serious indeed, and time is running out. We want a political solution, and we are putting all our efforts into achieving that goal.Those challenges must not lead us to lose sight of the necessity of a negotiated peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. There is a danger that the goal of a two-State solution, the only solution that can reconcile the legitimate interests of the two sides, will slip away. The two sides must build new trust. At the same time, they must refrain from doing anything that might jeopardize a two-State solution.Germanys foreign policy is a policy for peace. Germanys foreign policy is anchored in Europe. Many have been wondering whether Europe can successfully manage its sovereign debt crisis and whether it will continue to play a leading role in the world. The answer is an emphatic yes. Europe has a great responsibility in the world. And Germany is aware of its responsibility for Europe. The way out of the debt crisis is difficult. It requires spending discipline, solidarity and growth. We will continue down that road. Europe is growing closer together. Europe is consolidating. Europe will emerge from the crisis stronger than ever before. Europe will remain a force to be reckoned with as the worlds largest donor of development assistance, as an inspiration for peaceful regional cooperation, as a pioneer in climate action and disarmament, as a champion of rules-based globalization and as a driving force for United Nations reform.My countrys peaceful unification more than 20 years ago also signified the reunification of Europe. Since then, the world has changed dramatically. Today, we find ourselves on the threshold of a multipolar world. The world with its interdependencies needs a cooperative order. It needs strong and representative institutions. We will weaken the Security Council if we fail to adapt it to todays world. Together with our partners in the G-4 group, India, Brazil and Japan, Germany is prepared to assume greater responsibility.It cannot be that Latin America and Africa have no permanent seats on the Security Council or that dynamic Asia has only one. That does not reflect the 17realities of todays world, and it definitely does not reflect the realities of tomorrow.The challenges are too great for us to simply accept the status quo. The world is not only growing together; the pace of change is increasing. We are living in an age of breathtaking change. That change brings with it risks and new dangers, as well as new uncertainties. Above all, however, that change brings with it great opportunities, especially for young people. In this changing world we need a clear compass, and our compass is freedom. The yearning for freedom is rooted in peoples hearts all over the world. They are our partners in building a better future.Address by Mr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Independent State of Samoa."}}
