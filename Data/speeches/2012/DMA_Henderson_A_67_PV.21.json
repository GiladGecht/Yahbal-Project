{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of the Government and people of the Commonwealth of Dominica, I would like to congratulate Mr. Jeremic on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session and to wish him every success. We also express our appreciation and gratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for the able manner in which he presided over the sixty-sixth session.The sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly has convened at a time when we face myriad challenges — the impact of climate change, civil conflicts, hunger and starvation, poverty, HIAIDS and chronic non-communicable diseases. Those challenges, however, are equally matched by the tremendous opportunities created by the rapid advancement in science and technology and the unprecedented level of international cooperation.We therefore need the political will to harness those opportunities for the benefit of our peoples. That would necessarily require the transformation of multilateral institutions, such as the United Nations, including its organs and agencies, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to reflect equity and inclusion. Those changes must be supported by a shift in our systems of production and consumption and by a new economic system, built on the principles of fairness and differentiated treatment on the basis of the unique challenges of countries, especially the vulnerability of small island developing States (SIDS). I am confident that, with such an approach, we will be able to overcome those challenges in a functioning multilateral system.The President returned to the Chair.The unsustainable consumption and production systems that continue to deplete the worlds resources and that simultaneously contribute to global warming remain a major threat to the survival of those of us who live close to the worlds oceans. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) was a commendable effort by the international community to take stock of the human impact on the Earths resources and to commit to reversing the present trend. The outcome document, entitled “The future we want” (resolution , annex), falls short of our expectations. However, it remains a work in progress and presents a useful platform for the ongoing discussion of multilateral resolutions to the growing concern of sustainable development. More important, the outcome system in the world. Between 1999 and 2012 we have held 14 clean national elections, a world record in political participation. We should issue a warning, here in this forum, that anti-democratic national elements, in alliance with foreign interests, are attempting to use violence in order to subvert the will of the people. The Venezuelan people are prepared, however, once again to defend their democratic and revolutionary achievements.Venezuela needs a democratic opposition. Pluralism and diversity coexist in democracy. And peace is the only path for the homeland of Simon Bolivar. President Hugo Chavez Frias is guaranteeing the continuity of our sovereign and supportive foreign policy, focused on improving Latin American and Caribbean unity, enhancing cooperation with the peoples of the South, and building a multicentric and multipolar world, without imperial hegemonies. Similarly, he is guaranteeing the continuity of a national policy based on social justice.The successes of the Bolivarian Revolution are evident. Venezuela has met the targets set by the Millennium Development Goals before 2015. The number of households in extreme poverty has fallen dramatically, from 21 per cent in 1998 to 7 per cent in 2010. Social investment in my country is among the highest in the world. Venezuela has the highest minimum wage in Latin America and the Caribbean. According to the Gini coefficient, our country is the most egalitarian in Latin America and the Caribbean. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, we are ranked tenth among the best-fed peoples in the world. We are the country with the fifth-highest percentage of university enrolment in the world. Education and health care are free. All Venezuelans, without exception, have access to those rights.Those extraordinary achievements in economic, social and cultural rights have been attained in the context of a participatory democracy, in which civil and political rights are fully respected, as never before in our countrys history. The Venezuelan people have regained their sovereignty and self-determination. A revolution for freedom, justice and equality is under way. That is the Bolivarian revolution."}}
