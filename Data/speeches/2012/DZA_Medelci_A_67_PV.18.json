{"speech":{"0":" I would like to take this opportunity to warmly congratulate President Vuk Jeremic on his election to the presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I also pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his efforts during his tenure. I would also like to commend the continuing commitment and efforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.Today our world faces a complex turning point in its history, replete with challenges and opportunities. The deep geopolitical upheavals in our region and the serious problems resulting from the economic and financial crisis attest to that. We believe that our collective faith in multilateralism will help us to unite our efforts to find solutions and overcome the persistent uncertainty that has resulted from those changes. The unprecedented extent of our problems may risk worsening the existing imbalances in relations among nations. All of us, without exception, bear a responsibility for the future of our planet, which we would like to be more just and more united. No country has been spared the consequences of the global crisis, and their management cannot be considered by only a small number of States acting 13and abject poverty. Algeria acts in concert with the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States and other regional actors concerned with a view to reaching a peaceful and lasting settlement of the crisis in Mali. The roles played by the General Assembly and the Security Council are essential for the preservation and building of peace throughout the world and for the realization of the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter in the areas of international cooperation and development. Moreover, the missions of those two principal and complementary organs are based on legitimacy, contrary to the deadlock in the reform process that began years ago. We must therefore do everything possible to ensure that the General Assembly, the most representative organ of the United Nations, reclaims all its competence in that context. The working methods and membership of the Security Council must be revised to ensure its democratization in terms of new permanent and non-permanent members from the developing world, in particular from Africa, the cradle of civilization. Algeria is proud to celebrate this year the fiftieth anniversary of its independence and of its membership of the United Nations. Faithful to its principles, Algeria has made a wise contribution to the complete decolonization of Africa. Today it enjoys peace with its neighbours with a view to completing the process of regional integration. Algeria would like to become a member of the Human Rights Council, for which it is a candidate for the period 2014-2016, in order to continue defending the values on which its history and its determination to overcome adversity is based.Everyone knows that the road of human rights is littered with many pitfalls and obstacles, such as authoritarianism, xenophobia, poverty, discrimination and unilateral economic sanctions. In that regard, the embargo on Cuba, which has lasted for more than half a century and has created deprivation, is both unfair and anachronistic. Furthermore, attacks on Islam and Muslims are a violation of human rights and a threat to peaceful coexistence among peoples. We should all fight against the phenomenon of Islamophobia, which is based on a xenophobic ideology that erroneously likens Islam to terrorism. That phenomenon must be fought. In that context, the tragic events engendered by the infamous video concerning Islam and its Prophet are reprehensible in many respects. Similary, Algeria condemns acts of and the interrelated scourges of organized crime and illicit trafficking in drugs and weapons, which are widespread our region.Algeria welcomes the recent changes in some countries of North Africa and the Middle East that reflected the will of their peoples, who are searching for a democratic ideal, justice and dignity. Those are, in fact, the founding principles of the Algerian revolution. Committed to the principle of self-determination of peoples and mutual respect among nations, Algeria condemns all forms of violence and repression, wherever they arise. We will continue to believe that dialogue and negotiation are the best means for settling disputes.Algeria hopes that the people of Western Sahara will exercise their right to self-determination. We urge Morocco and the Frente Polisario to act in good faith and initiate formal talks, under the auspices of the United Nations, with a view to reaching a just and lasting solution, pursuant to the norms and provisions of international law. The search for peace, security and development is a priority for us all. That commitment was formally reaffirmed by the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement, including Algeria, at the Movements sixteenth summit, held in Tehran last August.We support the commitment of the United Nations to conflict prevention through its unflagging diplomatic efforts, and we appreciate our Organizations role in promoting appropriate solutions to major crises within the context of its tireless and comprehensive efforts to bring about development. Algeria is a member of the special joint committee of the United Nations and the League of Arab States to monitor the Syrian crisis. We supported Mr. Kofi Annan and we will do the same with his successor, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, with a view to reaching a political solution to the acute crisis that is unfolding within that fraternal country.In our region today, we are facing new risks and threats that point to a return of terrorism in its more violent manifestations, along with its interrelated scourges of organized crime and trafficking in drugs and weapons. It is in that context that we have to consider the complex situation in brotherly Mali. That crisis seriously threatens the security of the countries of the Sahel. In fact the deep, root causes of the situation can be attributed to the ills of severe underdevelopment 14 The President of the Republic, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, has given new impetus to the programme of reforms aimed at strengthening the democratic process, the rule of law and the advancement of women. The legislative elections of 10 May 2012 yielded a significant increase in womens representation, with 146 women Members of Parliament, representing one third of the Lower Chamber. Our country has made tangible progress in the political, economic and social areas, and we continue our efforts to establish and consolidate our democratic freedoms based on the principle of equal opportunity embodied in our Constitution. Those steps have enabled our country to achieve in general the Millennium Development Goals prior to 2015. That led to Algeria being chosen as one of the 50 countries selected by the United Nations for consultations on the Millennium Development Goals and the post-2015 development agenda.In conclusion, I thank members for their attention and wish them every success in the work of our session."}}
