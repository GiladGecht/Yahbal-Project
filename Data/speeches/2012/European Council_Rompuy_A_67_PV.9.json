{"speech":{"0":" The advance of democracy has taken place in successive waves since the United Nations was created. That advance has experienced a new acceleration, which we all can all welcome. Without underestimating the difficulties and problems encountered elsewhere, I 48 Tolerance is the ability to withstand criticism, to offer dialogue, to refrain from violence. As such, it shows self-confidence. At the same time, respect for the faith and beliefs of others is a key value for living together. Tolerance and respect acquire their full meaning in an open society that protects freedom of expression. Each and every one of us in this Hall has a responsibility to defend and promote tolerance in and between our countries, as well as respect. Violence and killing, such as that of United States Ambassador Christopher Stevens, can never be justified, regardless of their motivations.Today I join the voice of Europe to those who have spoken to deplore the civil war raging in Syria. Confronted with the massacre of tens of thousands of people, the world has united in horror and condemnation, but — we must be frank — we have not yet been able to stop the brutal violence. Of course Europe and others provide humanitarian support to refugees. Of course we support individuals who risk their lives collecting evidence of the massacres. Of course our diplomats in Damascus do their utmost to support the United Nations efforts for a peaceful solution. But we will remain powerless unless the international community unites in a common determination to end this senseless violence, which threatens to wreak havoc in the whole region.I should like to commend the excellent work and strong commitment of the Secretary-General, as well as that of Special Representative Lakhdar Brahimi, to find a solution to overcome this tragedy. I also welcome the initiatives aimed at bringing together the main regional players in a coherent international approach. Earlier this year, European leaders called upon all members of the Security Council to work together in an effort to stop the violence. Today that call is even more urgent.The country needs to move quickly towards a Syrian-led political transition that meets the democratic aspirations of the Syrian people, while fully respecting the civil and human rights of minorities. It is the only way out. Those responsible for the repression have no place in determining the future of Syria and must step aside. The longer that the conflict continues, the more radicalized people will become, the more blood will needlessly be shed, and the longer it will take for the wounds to heal.overnight. We know about long transitions. When European integration first started, within my lifetime, a majority of the countries that are now members were not yet democracies. For us, a transition of such magnitude should not be judged by its speed but by its direction and by progress achieved through countless steps forward.The starting point is free and fair elections. We therefore commend the achievements of Tunisia, Libya, Egypt and other countries in successfully organizing democratic elections, in which many citizens voted freely for the very first time in their lives — elections for which we were happy to lend expertise to national and local authorities.In order to ultimately bring jobs, social justice and freedom of expression to all, this gigantic democratic process will have to overcome, every single day, the obstacles of corruption, red tape and economic privileges and maintain the political determination to ensure inclusiveness. It is an important effort, to which many parties are contributing. For our part, across the region we offer advice to entrepreneurs and officials, help train judges and police and support journalists and civil society groups.In our experience, societies are stronger when women are fully able to take part in the political and economic lives of their countries, when their voices are heard and their choices respected. There may be temptations, once power is gained, to refuse to grant to some the rights that until recently were withheld from all. But a democracy can f lourish only when it gives all its people — whatever their gender, religion, language or ethnic identity — an equal say and equal rights, guaranteed in law and in practice.Finally, neighbours can achieve more when they work together. That is why we share experience from our own European union on issues such as connecting energy networks and removing regional obstacles to trade.Bringing together and reconciling former enemies in a common desire for peace, democracy and prosperity has been one of the European Unions great achievements. Respect, tolerance and non-violence are the core values, without which living together harmoniously is not possible. These are fragile values; sustaining them requires constant attention, especially in a global digital world in which messages of all kinds can spread faster than ever and can easily be exploited. 49to become more competitive and create jobs for the future. We have started building a banking union to better manage and contain financial sector risk; and in the coming months we will be defining the perspectives on where we are headed and where we want our economic and monetary union to be in 10 years time.We have already come a long way, and today we see the first results of that collective endeavour. Although there is still some way to go, I am confident that those efforts will meet with success and that Europe will emerge from the experience stronger, economically and politically.(spoke in French)That is what I have come before the Assembly to say. In our view as Europeans, managing the financial crisis not only concerns monetary operations and balancing budgets. What is at stake is the very future of our European project. The project was born in order to overcome the wars and dictatorships that had long haunted our continent. For 60 years, our union has allowed us to end nationalist hatred between countries and to establish a unified continent in peace that seeks social justice and prosperity, which requires daily efforts to maintain those values and establish them more firmly. Gains can always be forfeited. At the global level, it is the task of the General Assembly to strive tirelessly to pursue the same goals that we all share, and to clear the way forward towards greater harmony and greater progress throughout the world."}}
