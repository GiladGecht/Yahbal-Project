{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of the Prime Minister and the people of Fiji, I congratulate the President on his election and have full confidence in his guidance of the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I wish also to pay tribute to the tireless efforts Armenia must finally realize that the irresponsible and provocative policy of territorial claims, animosity and hatred towards neighbouring countries and nations based on historical, cultural, racial and religious prejudices has no chance of success. The earlier it grasps that fact, the sooner our countries will be able to reach mutual understanding and enjoy peace, stability and cooperation.It is clear that both the conflict-settlement process and its outcome must be consistent with international law. The achievement of peace, security, stability and confidence therefore depends first and foremost on the removal of the consequences of Armenias illegal use of force. That will ensure that the occupation of the territories of Azerbaijan is at an end and that the right of internally displaced Azerbaijani persons to return to their homes and recover their property and possessions will be implemented. That is what international law and the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions require, which means that this condition cannot be subject to compromise or used as a bargaining chip in the conflict settlement process. Armenias implementation of its obligation to withdraw its armed forces from the territory of Azerbaijan and to resolve outstanding issues of State responsibility for acts deemed wrongful under international law cannot be made contingent on addressing the aggressors unlawful and unacceptable claims.The fact that the situation has remained unresolved for so long does not speak well for the strength and efficiency of the international organizations that are deaing with the issue. It is obvious that the primary role in the resolution of the conflict lies with the States concerned. At the same time, when it comes to principles, it is everyones duty to defend them. In that regard, Azerbaijan highly appreciates the principled stance of Member States, as expressed in various forums, including the most recent summits of NATO, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Non-Aligned Movement, on issues of vital importance to our country and pertaining to its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We count on the continued resolve of the international community to defend the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, and on its strong solidarity with the just position of Azerbaijan.We would like to express our concern over the situation with regard to the Middle East peace process, which has been at a standstill with no substantive progress towards the resumption of direct talks 12 But the reward is not in meeting the goals; the reward is in children who are healthier, families that are less burdened, and generations given a better chance to become productive adults. We must never forget that behind each of those Millennium Development Goals are human beings — the citizens of our nations — who look to us to provide opportunities for a fuller life. We still have work to do particularly in meeting MDGs 1, 3 and 6, and we are working on those as best we can. The particular case of small island developing States in meeting those goals and their specific challenges will be addressed by the third Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, to be held in the Pacific region in 2014. The success of the Conference will be measured in actions, not simply in more words. Substantive preparations for the Conference must therefore be oriented towards taking action and achieving specific goals.In addition to support for regional development, Fiji is also taking the lead in the region on broadband connectivity. It is clear to us that broadband is an essential technology for improving education, medicine, agriculture and environmental services. Broadband technology is especially important to us because it will help unite a dispersed people and help draw us closer to our island neighbours in the Pacific. If we take care to make it accessible, affordable and understandable, we will bring an entire universe of wisdom and understanding to the smallest schools and remotest villages. Information need no longer be the property mostly of people who live in the cities or who are attached to large institutions.Like all islands nations, Fiji relies on the ocean and its resources as our economic lifeblood and source of sustainable development. While fish and other living marine resources have been vital to Fijis economy and livelihood, we believe that our efforts to explore deep-sea mineral resources have greater potential, provided that a precautionary approach with regard to environmental sustainability is ensured.The theme selected by the President for this years general debate, “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means”, is most relevant in these times of turbulence across the world. The United Nations must continue to be at the vanguard of international peace and security. It must be able to respond to new types of crises, always with an aim to stabilize the places it of his predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, through what has been an eventful and turbulent year for the global community of nations.The world is facing many challenges that demand our attention and collective action. As we all gathered last June in Rio de Janeiro for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, millions of people were recovering from, or living through, natural disasters. In Fiji, we experienced our worst f looding on record during the months of January and April. Beyond the human cost, the economic damage to infrastructure, schools, businesses, agriculture and tourism — a sector that generates 33 per cent of Fijis gross domestic product — was immense, and we still have not fully recovered. Our f loods were by no means the worlds worst climatic disaster of the year; other peoples suffered much worse. But as a people who live on a group of small islands in the South Pacific, we feel particularly vulnerable.The ongoing failure of the international community to seriously address climate change means that we will all see more frequent and more intense weather events. Those will erode our development gains and leave our people feeling poorer and less secure, so it is clear that it is indispensable to incorporate disaster risk reduction into global and national development strategies.The post-2015 development agenda is now under discussion, and frameworks and modalities are being developed. However, our job with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is not complete. As a global community of nations that has committed to those goals, we must give meaningful support to all those States lagging in their progress. We must also ensure that a post-2015 development agenda does not simply delay the target date for the MDG indicators and goals. The development community can do much more, including meeting our agreed objectives for development funding.Fiji has embarked on a comprehensive reform programme not only to promote development, but also to improve the lives of our people. We have embraced the Millennium Development Goals as they were intended — to provide specific objective standards for improving the lives of our people. We are the second country in the world to introduce the pneumococcal and rotavirus immunizations as standard, with a view to minimizing child mortality. That represents progress towards meeting MDGs 4 and 5. 13parties. Fiji works through the Melanesian Spearhead Group in monitoring the progress of implementation of the Noumea Accord. Additionally, at the Engaging with the Pacific Meetings held in Fiji in 2011 and 2012, Pacific island leaders committed to supporting the inalienable right of the people of Maohi NuFrench Polynesia to self-determination. We look forward to working through the United Nations processes and with all relevant partners in order to have the question of Maohi Nuis self-determination placed on the United Nations agenda again.Fiji is itself working through a period of reform and transition. We are building a sustainable democracy founded on the principle of “one person, one vote, one value”. Elections will be held under a new constitution and electoral system no later than September 2014. Those elections will see the citizens of Fiji go to the polls without regard to their race for the first time in our nations history. Fijis new constitution will be based on some unassailable democratic principles: a secular State that recognizes our multi-faith society; a common national identity in which all citizens, not just indigenous people, will call themselves Fijians for the first time; a war against corruption, which inhibits the countrys development; an independent judiciary to uphold the rights of every Fijian; social justice and the elimination of all forms of discrimination, so that every Fijian is treated equally; good and transparent governance; and lowering the voting age to 18 to give our young people a voice.We set up an independent Constitutional Commission in March to draft a new constitution guided by those principles. It will be a constitution of and for the people. Ordinary Fijians are seizing the opportunity to put forward their views at public hearings throughout the country and to voice the issues that are most important to them. The Commissions recommendations will be reviewed by a Constituent Assembly in early 2013. This body, made up of a broad cross-section of Fijian society, will formulate the final document through public discussion and debate. That will set the scene for elections in 2014, for which preparations have already begun. Through a process of electronic registration carried out in July and August of this year, almost half a million Fijians have so far registered to vote.Throughout this process, we have stayed true to the principle that we in Fiji must determine our own destiny, one that is inclusive and fair to all citizens. enters and leave behind not just a state of peace and stability, but also an environment that fosters freedom and opportunity for the people.In that context, Fiji continues to play a role in peacekeeping missions around the world that is far beyond what is expected of a country of our size and level of development. We contribute troops and police personnel to operations in Iraq, Liberia, South Sudan, Darfur and Timor-Leste. Fiji has responded to exigent requests by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, above and beyond agreed contributions, to ensure that peacekeeping operations in Iraq can continue unhindered, despite the additional burden it has placed on our troops operating far from home and for longer than envisaged. We believe that all nations must find ways to make the world safer, more humane and more livable, and as a people we are proud that we can make that contribution to global peace and security and to the lives of citizens far away from us. That is not just Government policy; it is a calling that is deeply embraced by the Fijian people.Recognizing the role that peacekeeping missions with expanded mandates play in helping to build the foundations of a sustainable future, Fiji has in the past year also started to contribute in a small yet meaningful way to the corrections and justice sector of peacekeeping missions. Mentoring and strengthening corrections and justice institutions is part of the process of allowing post-conflict societies to take control of their own destinies, and Fiji is pleased to be able to be a part of those unfolding stories around the world.Fiji has been honoured to be a part of that process in our own region through our contributions in Timor-Leste via the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT). Following the successful elections in Timor-Leste early this year, UNMIT will be in a position to wind down its operations later this year, allowing the Timorese people to take full ownership and control of their own destinies. Timor-Leste is now an observer to the regional organization of which Fiji is the current Chair, the Melanesian Spearhead Group, and we trust that through that organization and the United Nations we will have many years of collaboration ahead.In the spirit of supporting self-determination, Fiji continues to work through the Decolonization Committee of the United Nations to ensure that New Caledonias right to self-determination, as expressed in the Noumea Accord, is implemented faithfully by all 14 opportunities for the young and less aff luent. As part of Fijis progress in reform towards democracy, we are reviewing our current labour laws to ensure their compliance with the 34 ILO conventions that Fiji has ratified. The tripartite Employment Relations Advisory Board is a key participant in this process. This year alone, Fiji has ratified or adopted eight ILO instruments, as recommended by the tripartite Board, including the 2006 Maritime Labour Convention. By empowering Fijians, the Government is seeking to ensure that all citizens, regardless of ethnic background, are on a level playing field and in possession of the tools needed to compete with their peers in the global community, improve their livelihoods and fulfil their dreams. By modernizing Fiji, the Government is seeking to make the country and its institutions and legal system strong, independent and world-class.Fiji may be a relatively small country, but it has big aspirations. They include being a good global citizen, a leader by example among island nations, and an actively engaged member of the international community. In the spirit of constructive contribution to the global community and the United Nations, I am pleased to say that at todays ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 and China, Fiji was endorsed as the Chair of the Group for the year 2013. Fiji takes on this responsibility with a deep sense of humility, a willingness to work collaboratively with all States, and a commitment to addressing the inequalities that exist between developing and developed countries.As we look forward to a productive sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly, we reiterate our full support for and cooperation with the President and all Members, with a view to advancing the objectives of this body and the aspirations of the global community."}}
