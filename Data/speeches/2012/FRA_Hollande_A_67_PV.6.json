{"speech":{"0":" This is the first time that I speak from this rostrum at the United 44 Iran, but to tell their leaders that enough is enough and that negotiations must be resumed before it is too late.The third urgent issue is at last to find a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The status quo is not a response; it is an impasse. France will make every effort to re-establish the basis for negotiations leading to the coexistence of the two States in question; everyone knows that this is the only solution that could lead to a just and lasting peace in the region.The last of the urgent issues that I will mention, although there are many others, might be the most important one for us to focus on this week: the Sahel. The situation created by the occupation of territory in northern Mali by terrorist groups is intolerable, inadmissible and unacceptable. It is unacceptable not only for Mali, which is affected by that terrorist threat, but also for all countries of the region and beyond the region — all of those that one day might be affected by terrorism.The African Union, which I commend, and the Economic Community of West African States have said that they are prepared to take courageous decisions. The authorities of Mali have spoken; there is no time to lose. France will support any initiative that will enable the Africans themselves to resolve that issue within the framework of international law, with a clear mandate from the Security Council. Mali must recover its territorial integrity, and terrorism must be eliminated from that area of the Sahel.The role of the United Nations is to respond to urgent situations. But there is another objective that should unite us here, and that is development. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in Rio, in which I participated, was a disappointing stage for some and an encouraging one for others. I believe that today we have an agenda that should encompass economic growth, poverty reduction, social progress and environmental protection. That is what we need to do over the long term.The 2015 deadline for a climate agreement is fast approaching. I wish to state here that France is ready to host the United Nations conference on climate change to be held at that time, because I want us to succeed together in meeting that challenge.In parallel, I would recall that one of the disappointments of Rio was our failure to agree on the creation of a major United Nations organization in favour of an increased African presence, including among the permanent members. Having a seat on the Security Council is not a privilege justified by history, and it is not a matter of satisfying some ambition related to economic power. No, having a seat on the Security Council means making the commitment to take action to promote peace in the world. Indeed, we must act and act together, but act quickly, because it is urgent. The most urgent situation is in Syria. The Assembly has several times denounced the massacres carried out by the Syrian regime, called for those responsible to be prosecuted and expressed the desire for a democratic transition. But the ordeal of the population continues to this day. There have been almost 30,000 deaths in the last 18 months. How many more deaths will we wait for before we take action? How can we allow the paralysis of the United Nations to continue? I know one thing for certain: the Syrian regime will never again take its place among the alliance of nations. It has no future among us. This is why I have taken the decision, on behalf of France, to recognize the provisional Government representing the new Syria as soon as it is formed. That Government will itself have to give guarantees that every community in Syria will be respected and will be able to live in security in their own country. Without further delay, I would ask that the United Nations immediately give the Syrian people all of the assistance and support they are requesting and, in particular, that the liberated areas be protected and humanitarian aid be assured for refugees. As for the leaders in Damascus, they must know that the international community will not stand by if they take the unhappy decision to use chemical weapons. Another situation that is urgent is the fight against the most serious of threats to stability in the world, namely, the proliferation of nuclear weapons. For several years now, Iran has been ignoring the demands of the international community. It shuns monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency. It does not keep its word or uphold Security Council resolutions. I had hoped that negotiations could take place in earnest and that steps could be outlined, but, again, no negotiations have taken place. France will not accept such actions, which threaten not only security in the region but peace throughout the world. I therefore state once again that we are prepared to adopt new sanctions, not to punish the great people of 45fundamental rights and freedoms. The Arab Spring showed that those values are universal and apply to all continents and countries.I want to welcome the events that took place in Tunisia, in Libya, in Egypt. It is true that transitions are not always easy. There are risks, and setbacks can occur. Some may attempt, through violence, to reverse the progress made and the achievements gained. France will call on the new political authorities emanating from democratic elections in those countries to wage an unrelenting combat against complacency, extremism, fanaticism, hatred, intolerance and violence, whatever the provocation may be, because there can never be any justification for violence.France wants to set an example. It is not telling anyone what to do; that is simply its history and its message. We want to be an example in the promotion of fundamental freedoms. That is our combat, and we are honoured to wage it. That is why France will continue to fight to abolish the death penalty, to ensure womens right to equality and dignity, and to work towards the universal decriminalization of homosexuality, which cannot be viewed as a crime but must be recognized as an orientation. We will continue to fight for the protection of civilians. Moreover, I recall that the Assembly affirmed the principle that all States have the responsibility to ensure the security of their civilians. If a State fails in that obligation, it is up to us, the United Nations, to use the means at its disposal to meet it in its place. Let us not neglect that promise, as it can serve us. I am thinking, in particular, of what is happening in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where civilians are the main victims of clashes and where foreign interference must cease as soon as possible.The President returned to the Chair.Those are the goals that France will support and defend at the United Nations. France has confidence in the United Nations. We know that no State, however powerful, can deal with emergencies, undertake the fight for development or overcome all crises. No State can do that, but, on the contrary, if we act together, we will live up to our responsibilities. France wants the United Nations to be the centre and the framework for global governance, but do the States that make up the Organization want that to be our purpose and goal? for the environment. That remains Frances objective. Such an agency would be based in Africa, because that continent, which has been neglected for too long, is facing climate-related challenges. It would also be highly symbolic to entrust Africa with such a global agency for the environment.With respect to development, I believe that we should face reality. We will not achieve the Millennium Development Goals without new resources. Everyone knows the budgetary limitations of our respective States. That is why today, from this rostrum here at the United Nations, I am making an appeal for innovative financing, which would give us the means to enable our organizations to fight effectively against diseases such as HIAIDS and malaria.I would like to commend the success of the International Drug Purchase Facility, which was financed by a tax on airline tickets. That path has been opened, and today we must take another step in that direction. I propose a tax on financial transactions — which several European Union countries have already agreed to — aimed at slowing down the movement of capital or at least financing development and helping to fight health-related scourges. France has adopted such a tax. We have also made another commitment: to dedicate at least 10 per cent of the benefits of that tax to development and to fight health-related threats and pandemics.That is the message that I wanted to send to the Assembly today: let us ensure that a global tax on financial transactions can be levied and that the benefits it yields can be spent on development and fighting pandemics. That would be an excellent example of what I call the globalization of solidarity, and one of the best ideas that todays world could implement.But the mission of the United Nations is not only to fight financial instability or ensure that development remains at the centre of our concerns: it is to work to counter all forms of instability. I am thinking here about drug trafficking, a scourge that affects producing, transit and consuming countries. To combat drug traffickers, who are frequently allied with terrorist networks, the United Nations must elaborate and implement a global strategy to fight against drugs.Arms trafficking also poses a major threat. France is firmly committed to the conclusion of a universal arms trade treaty. What the United Nations must defend and promote is a worldview that is based on respect for 46 very many conflicts. Energy resources are not equally distributed, so there is inequality in accessibility to energy. The existing dependency on energy remains a reason for abuse, not cooperation. A lack of clear and globally accepted rules and norms in the energy sector contributes to continuing tensions.Recurring gas and oil supply crises every year remind us that, in a global environment, friction and disagreements over energy still lead to conflicts and tensions of all sorts. Being a small country, without its own resources, especially sources of energy, Lithuania is well aware of the negative consequences of energy dependency in an environment that has no universal agreement on or compliance with clear rules of the game. What can we do?First, we need to increase global energy sustainability. I would like to congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his Sustainable Energy for All initiative, which is really relevant and timely. The improvement of energy efficiency, the diversification of the energy supply and global accessibility to energy are certainly the goals for which we should strive.Secondly, we need to make existing inequalities in access to energy a source of cooperation, not tension. The use of energy dependency as an instrument for political or economic blackmail must be eliminated, not only to ensure equality but also to increase global competiveness and effectiveness. With the ongoing practices of price-fixing and abuse of monopolistic positions, which both distort competition, there can be no development, security or effectiveness.Thirdly, our answer to energy-related conflict prevention should be international agreements that make clear that the use of energy to gain political goals is unacceptable. Responsibility for violations should also be clear and unavoidable. We must grant international institutions greater discretion to launch investigations and to impose sanctions on activities that hinder the free f low of energy resources, impede diversification or set unfair prices for customers.I have one final point. There is no energy-related issue as dangerous as unsafe nuclear energy development. It is obvious that each country can decide on its own energy mix. However, each national decision to develop nuclear energy can have a devastating and transboundary impact, and should be extremely well grounded and researched. There can be no sustainability, development or peaceful cooperation without nuclear I say in all seriousness that when there is paralysis, inertia and inaction, injustice and intolerance find their place. What I would like members to understand is that we must act in order to shoulder our responsibilities and to deal with urgent situations, such as Syria, nuclear proliferation and the Sahel. We must also work for another world that is based on development and innovative financing and for the fight against health crises. We must act, always and together. Let us live up to the mission entrusted to us and to the expectations of peoples. That is Frances message. "}}
