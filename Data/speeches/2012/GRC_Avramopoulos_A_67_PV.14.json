{"speech":{"0":" I would like to thank the outgoing President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser of the State of Qatar, and to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremic of the Republic of Serbia on his election to the presidency of the Assembly at the sixty-seventh session. I also want to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who tirelessly carries on at the helm of our Organization in an ever-shifting global environment.I wish to affirm our endorsement of the positions voiced in the statement made by the observer of the European Union. As always, Greece remains fully committed to the United Nations, to the values of peace, security, and to raising the living standards of people all over the world so that they may lead lives of dignity.(spoke in English)At the recent High-level Meeting on the rule of law, the States Members of the United Nations reaffirmed their commitment to one of the most important principles includes an item on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia.Our country is ready to actively cooperate with the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs and to participate in a number of initiatives in that regard. Given that further improving relevant United Nations agencies may be one practical step in implementing consistent disarmament measures, we think it appropriate to consider the establishment of a United Nations subregional centre for disarmament in Asia.Strengthening comprehensive, targeted and long-term cooperation with the United Nations is a strategic choice of Turkmenistan and a priority of its foreign policy. As an important part of that cooperation, our country is considering participating in United Nations activities to ensure human development, better living standards and peoples well-being; to establish conditions conducive to global economic and social growth; to utilize human creativity; and to promote peoples rights and freedoms.In pursuing those lofty goals and striving to contribute, where possible, to their achievement, Turkmenistan has announced its candidacy for membership of the Economic and Social Council for the period 2013-2015. That decision was made on the basis of the countrys current progress in the political, socioeconomic, cultural and other fields, its active role in international processes and its understanding of the responsibilities inherent to membership of the Council. If elected, Turkmenistan plans to use all available means to improve international cooperation for the effective implementation of sustainable development goals. At the same time, Turkmenistan will actively contribute to strengthening the Economic and Social Council by expanding its role in addressing the urgent issue of global socioeconomic development.The most important element of the modern system of international relations is humanitarian cooperation. To underscore that the humanitarian component is at the centre of the highest principles and values of the community of nations, our country will continue to promote its cooperation with the United Nations on protecting human rights and on establishing conditions conducive to human development. On that basis, given that the United Nations plays a major role in the comprehensive development of humanity and bearing in mind the achievement of the Millennium Development 23Security in the Middle East remains a crucial quest for the countries of the region and the world community. Greece maintains historic ties of friendship, cooperation and mutual respect with its neighbours in North Africa and the Middle East â€” countries that, following the momentous events of the Arab Spring, are moving towards successful electoral processes and towards building democratic institutions. The European Union should be there, right by their side, as they build their future. However, we have not seen successful outcomes everywhere. In Syria, demonstrators faced tanks and a brutal crack-down. On numerous occasions we have called on President Al-Assad to open the way for a transitional authority, comprising all sections of Syrian society. Yet, we are still in a prolonged bloody stalemate that jeopardizes the present and the future of the Syrian people, and stability in our region. The result has been no less than 29,000 victims, 250,000 refugees, 2.5 million Syrian citizens in need. We are convinced that a Syrian-led political solution is still achieveable, and we see no alternative to such a solution. Greece believes that there is no military solution to the Syrian problem. Peace and security in the Eastern Mediterranean cannot be achieved without a just, lasting and comprehensive solution of the Palestinian issue, on the basis of a two-State solution. We regret the prolonged stagnation in the direct negotiations between the two parties. It is only through negotiations that peace can finally be achieved. We believe that unilateral actions cannot fulfil Israels quest for security or the Palestinians aspirations for statehood, which we fully support. The two-State solution should remain feasible on the ground.I would now like to outline the current position on some salient issues concerning our immediate neighbourhood. The issue of the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is, beyond its semantic dimension, an important piece in the puzzle of putting to rest irredentist notions and attempts to rewrite history in our region. I have been informed of what the representative of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia said today in the General Assembly (see ). Distorting reality in front of the entire international community and using nineteenth-century rhetoric in the twenty-first century is counterproductive and will lead us nowhere. Populism and nationalism make up the worst possible mix for the promotion of underlying the international order, which should be our guide in the conduct of diplomacy and international relations. We fully agree with the Secretary-Generals opinion that freedom of expression is a fundamental right and privilege belonging to all people, without any discrimination, and should not be abused by anyone in a disgraceful and shameful way.Unfortunately, there are those who will do everything to provoke, as we have witnessed again recently in the provocative and unacceptable movie which denigrates Islam. Nevertheless, we should strongly condemn all forms of violence, and, in this particular case, the violence against diplomatic missions. There is no justification for it. After all, the measure and limit of every right is the respect of the right of the other.Greece is dedicated to United Nations efforts to enhance international cooperation on the promotion and protection of human rights. We have therefore decided to present our candidacy for membership in the Human Rights Council for the 2013-2015 term. In this context, we also support the adoption of the European Union Strategic Framework on Human Rights and Democracy and the appointment of the European Union Special Representative for Human Rights as important steps towards a more coherent European policy and approach to human dignity.The need to respect and protect human rights and humanitarian law is now as urgent as ever. In fact, illegal migration in the Mediterranean region has given rise to a humanitarian crisis. That is why Greece has introduced major legislative and institutional reforms in the fields of asylum and migration.I now turn to one of the main pillars of United Nations action: peace and security. Greeces neighbourhood has often been at the centre of serious, interrelated security challenges. My country has consistently played a stabilizing role, which we have accomplished through the pursuit of a policy of peaceful resolution of disputes, within the framework of the United Nations Charter, based on respect for international law and the principles of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. Despite the economic and financial crisis, Greece has continued to participate actively in a number of United Nations missions and operations around the world, including in Kosovo and Afghanistan and in the anti-piracy efforts off the coast of Somalia.24 resolutions and taking into account the fact that the Republic of Cyprus is a member of the European Union, which currently holds its presidency. However, after 38 years, the division of the island continues and the results of the talks have been disappointing, owing to Turkish-Cypriot intransigence about engaging in constructive talks. We applaud Cypruss decision to act on its sovereign right to exploit the natural gas deposits in its exclusive economic zone.We are forging partnerships with other emerging energy players in the region, including Israel and the Arab countries, with which we enjoy traditional relations of friendship and trust. Greece is contributing to bringing stability and economic growth to the Eastern Mediterranean, in order to promote energy security and diversification of sources and suppliers for the European energy markets. A resolution of the Cyprus issue would have a tremendously positive effect, not just for the Cypriots themselves but for Greek-Turkish relations and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean as a whole.I will conclude with a few words about the economic crisis that Greece is confronting with the help of its partners in the European Union and the international community. The new tripartite coalition Government in Greece is implementing an ambitious economic adjustment programme in order to improve its macroeconomic outlook and achieve fiscal adjustment, while at the same time addressing structural reforms aimed at growth and job creation. That effort has produced impressive results, especially a significant reduction of the primary deficit. At the same time, the Greek economy has regained more than 50 per cent of its competitiveness in relation to its global trade partners, while the business and investment climate is on a positive path. We are determined to continue along that path, bearing in mind that the Greek people are suffering tremendously from the implementation of the austerity programme.In a broader view, it is evident that this crisis is not just Greek or European. International economies are intertwined, and therefore ours is also a global crisis. In that respect, we need to examine measures aimed at generating all-inclusive and job-creating growth, measures that will regenerate economies and diminish the social impact of the crisis.The eurozone, with Greece at the forefront, is making a hard and painstaking effort and adopting new anyones national interests and the stability of our region. Greece believes that the solution lies in a fair settlement. That would be a name with a geographical qualifier, since Macedonia is a geographical region that overlaps the territories of three countries, the largest part being in Greece, followed by Bulgaria and then the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. And of course the name must be used in relation to everyone; it is an erga omnes obligation, to use the Latin phrase. When we resolve this issue, we will be able to realize the vast potential in our relations, to our mutual benefit, and Greece will be the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonias staunchest ally and friend in its efforts to fulfil its Euro-Atlantic aspirations. After all, as is well known, Greece is the most important economic partner of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, with a large presence of Greek companies operating there. We also support the European Union-facilitated dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina, and we welcome the constructive approach to the talks on the part of the Serbian leadership. Dialogue is the only way to resolve problems in Kosovo, while unilateral measures and escalation, especially in the north, should be avoided by all means.Less than two years from now, Greeces European Union presidency will launch Agenda 2014, which aims to reinvigorate the European perspectives of all our neighbours in the Western Balkans. Elsewhere in our immediate neighbourhood, Greece is consistently pursuing stronger cooperation with Turkey, through a wide range of initiatives, so that we can improve our relations to the benefit of both peoples. Moreover, Greece continues to support Turkeys candidacy for full membership in the European family, on the condition, of course, that all relevant membership criteria are met and that the necessary reforms are carried out. It is of the utmost importance that Turkey gives tangible signs of full respect for international law and abandons attitudes like the standing threat of casus belli against Greece, or its attitude vis-a-vis Cyprus, which undermines efforts to build trust.That brings us to the Eastern Mediterranean as a whole, where Greece continues to play its role as a force for peace and stability. Greece supports the efforts of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus to pursue negotiations with the Turkish Cypriot community, under United Nations auspices, aimed ultimately at reuniting the island, according to United Nations 25to thank Mr. Al-Nasser for his positive contribution as President at the last session.The world is undergoing major and profound changes. The trends towards multipolarity, economic globalization and the application of information technology are gaining momentum. Countries have never been as interconnected and interdependent as they are today. Emerging markets and developing countries have never had such strong influence, and cross-civilizational dialogue and exchanges are f lourishing as never before. To promote peace, development and cooperation has become the shared aspiration of people across the world and the common pursuit of the international community.On the other hand, the world is still far from being peaceful. The underlying impact of the international financial crisis and the European debt crisis remains strong. Destabilizing factors and uncertainties affecting global growth have increased. Regional turbulence persists, hotspot issues keep emerging and traditional and non-traditional security issues have become intertwined. The international security environment is highly complex.Facing both unprecedented opportunities and challenges, we must not allow the outdated Cold War mentality and zero-sum game theory to stand in our way. We should act like passengers who stick together in a boat when crossing a torrential river and seek win-win progress through cooperation. That is the only option for countries around the world. To ensure ones own security, a country should respect and accommodate the security of other nations. To achieve ones own development, a country should actively promote common development. In pursuing ones own interests, a country should take into account the interests of other nations. Only by promoting common security and development for all its members can the international community effectively address complex and multiple security threats and global challenges, resolve increasingly serious difficulties facing development and ensure durable peace and sustainable development in the world. With that in mind, China believes that it is important to do the following.We should promote equality and democracy in international relations. Mutual respect and equality are basic norms governing international relations. All countries, large or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are equal members of the international community. paths and ways to climb out of the deep economic crisis. The pivotal role and geopolitical importance of Greece in South-Eastern Europe, in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East will emerge as a result of the events unfolding in our neighbourhood. It is indeed a stabilizing role, since our vital national interests are aligned with the promotion of peace, stability, prosperity and regional security. Our advantage is not only our geographical position but also our strong political will to become a cornerstone of stability and security, at a time when uncertainty dangerously threatens our region.During the past two years, Greece has been portrayed by the global media as a country defined by its economic need. It is true that our country is experiencing a painful transition leading to economic recovery and growth. It is also true that the Greek people have known in their 3,000 years of history crises more serious than the present one. We survived. We excelled. Let me assure the General Assembly and the family of nations that Greece will make it.We will make it because Greece is larger than its geographical size and more precious than its present fiscal reality. Through knowledge, science and art, Greece is there when progress takes place. Through democracy Greece is present as a global civilization. Through Olympism Greece unites humankind. Through our merchant f leet and our maritime tradition we carry goods all around the world. Through our love for life we constantly remind the world that progress should always be measured on the human scale. Through and by our legacy we will make it once more.We will make it because Greece is not about asking. Greece is about offering. Let us not forget that Greece holds intrinsic value in the hearts and minds of people irrespective of nationality, race and religion. And that gives us the moral power, the support and the encouragement, along with our partners in Europe, to give to the world and to win our current fight."}}
