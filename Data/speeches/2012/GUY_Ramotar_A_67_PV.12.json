{"speech":{"0":" It is a distinct honour for me to speak today for the first time as President of the Republic of Guyana in this general debate of the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly.To the President of the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, I extend my delegations sincere congratulations on his election. I also pay tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, who presided over the sixty-sixth session with distinction during a trying period for this body. The Secretary-General deserves commendation for his unstinting service to the Organization and our continued support as the constitutions or charters, or fraudulent elections. Such a court would have to be competent to consider a number of disputes and issues, to rule on the legality or illegality of elections that are not in line with the Charter of the United Nations. All systems, especially democratic ones, would face the clear duty of being recognized by the international constitutional court. The court would also make recommendations and provide the necessary advice to all those who so request. The body could serve as a deterrent against any despot, any tyrannical regime, in the case of any such regime forging election results. The court would contribute to the very disappearance of those regimes, because it would strengthen the role of peaceful civic resistance. Otherwise, the only choice would be to live under oppression or to turn to violence. We all know just how expensive that can be.Tunisia strongly advocates the protection of the environment to ensure that we leave succeding generations a sustainable world.We also want to leave a world living in peace and to douse the f lames of war in Afghanistan, Mali, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan and the Middle East. Tunisia requests rapid humanitarian intervention to help save the heroic Syrian people and to ensure the departure of President Bashar Al-Assad and his criminal regime. We call for the deployment of an Arab peace force to guarantee the transition and to create a democratic State, which would be pluralistic and that could live in peace.Tunisia wishes to reiterate its support for the Palestinian people and their right to a just peace and the release of thousands of prisoners. We support the creation of a Palestinian State with Al-Quds as its capital and with membership in this Organization. We condemn violence against women and children. We denounce the fanaticism, the anti-Semitism and the Islamophobia that one often sees. We call for tolerance to allow all religious minorities, including Muslims in Burma and Christians living in all Muslim countries, to exercise their faith freely. The chasm between the rich and the poor must be reduced.During the upcoming Nuclear Materials Conference, Tunisia will insist on the need to free the Middle East from nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction. We champion pluralistic, tolerant civilian societies and institutions. Tunisia is the country of peaceful democratic revolution. 9attaining universal secondary education. However, significant challenges remain in reaching people in the remote areas of our country. If we are to encourage our youth to become responsible citizens and prepare them to be the leaders of tomorrow, we must ensure that our education systems allow for the development of their full potential.I am therefore honoured to join the Secretary-General in promoting the Education First initiative. We are nonetheless conscious that the sustainability of our growth and that of other developing countries will be hindered if the weakness in the international economy is prolonged.Guyana therefore continues to advocate for reform of the graduation policies and aid allocation criteria of the international financial institutions to take account of the structural vulnerability and level of economic resilience of small States, for measures to ease the debt burden, for renewed access to concessionary financing for highly indebted middle-income countries and for the strengthening of financial regulations.The international economic crisis has also led to growing negative social problems. Despite great efforts by many countries, the war against narco–trafficking is far from over. That scourge has an impact on all our countries. It has also directly and indirectly engendered the growth in criminal activity in our region. The availability of guns in many societies — I would note that we do not produce them — most of which has come as a by-product of the narco-trade, has contributed to the growth of gun crimes and murders in the region and beyond. To deal with the problem, Guyana is ready to cooperate fully with the international community to bring the criminals to justice and free our people from the multiple dangers that drug trafficking creates.Even as our society advances, the issues we have to deal with often seem to multiply. The issue of trafficking in persons has also arisen over the past decade as a major concern. We join with all democratic and decent people throughout the world in condemning that crime. Again, it is a campaign that requires a high level of cooperation. We are ready to play our part.If solving those collective problems requires greater will, then other transnational problems such as the climate crisis require urgent, immediate and decisive action. Our failure to do so risks causing irretrievable harm to humankind.United Nations negotiates the many issues that confront our world.The present international system is characterized by change and crises. A tide of change is evident at all levels, from the local to the global, and it is either being precipitated or accompanied by multiple crises within the global community.In the economic realm, continuing adverse conditions stymie global efforts to achieve internationally agreed-upon development objectives. Recovery from the global financial crisis is at best incipient and sluggish. Several of the major contributors to global output are grappling with unsustainable fiscal balances that hinder their ability to stimulate lasting recovery. The problems in those economies continue to place a drag on global growth. Compounding those difficulties is the slowdown in output in major emerging economies. Naturally, those events have had serious negative impacts on developing countries.Although more resilient than in earlier times, developing countries have paid a heavy price as a result of the present difficulties in the world economy. That has been reflected in growth that is generally lower than pre-crisis levels. Already grappling with adverse trading arrangements and the consequences of an inconclusive and disappointing Doha Development Round, the plight of developing countries has been made worse by the prolonged global slump. Many of the gains made before 2008 have been erased by the continuing difficulties in the world economy. The small, vulnerable economies of the Caribbean face special challenges, compounded by generally high levels of indebtedness and falling export revenues.It is within the unfavourable international climate that we have to judge our own performance. Guyana has had to face many serious challenges. However, we have worked steadfastly to build a more resilient economy and country. We have managed to forestall the worst effects of the international economic crises. Over the past six years, we have achieved an economic growth rate of approximately 5 per cent per annum. The growth rate is, I believe, the result of the investments that we have been making in our people. More than 30 per cent of our budget is dedicated to education, health, housing, water and social programmes to help the most vulnerable.Today Guyana has achieved universal primary education, and we have come a long way towards 10 Despite the strong scientific and economic case for action, the global response to the climate crisis falls short of what is required in terms of both scale and urgency. The projected level of reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions is much too low. Scientists are warning us of the catastrophic consequences if the rise in greenhouse emissions is not halted. Already some States are facing imminent extinction. To add insult to injury, the promise of fast-start financing made at Copenhagen a few years ago has not materialized. The result is that those most at risk are effectively deprived of the means to adapt to that existential threat. We cannot continue to deal with threats to the survival of the planet with such casualness.As a low-lying coastal State, Guyana is mindful of the dangers posed by climate change. We have been at the forefront of the appeals to the international community to match its concern with tangible action. It is clear that some countries are taking the issue seriously. Norway has led the way by giving tangible support in fighting climate change. Guyana, for its part, has chosen to pursue a low-carbon development strategy in order to ensure economic growth, social progress and environmental sustainability for present and future generations of our citizens. But, as our experience patently demonstrates, that path is not without its hurdles. Just three short months ago, in Rio de Janeiro, we renewed our collective commitment to sustainable development and to ensuring the promotion of an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable future for our planet. We also agreed that the eradication of poverty was the greatest challenge facing the world today, and we recommitted ourselves to freeing humankind from poverty and hunger as a matter of urgency.We need, therefore, as a matter of exigency, to respond to the plight of more than 1 billion of our fellow citizens who bear the ache of hunger on a daily basis. They are found on every continent, in every city and in rural communities across the world.Their plight is worsening. Food prices are surging once again, and risk rising even further as severe droughts decimate crop yields. Those who suffer from chronic hunger today cannot wait until the international community agrees on a post-2015 development framework. They cannot wait until we craft new sustainable development goals. They need action now. The decades-long under-investment in agriculture and rural development needs to be urgently reversed if food security is to be guaranteed on a sustainable basis. In line with the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security, Guyana calls for an acceleration of the twin-track approach to enhancing direct action against hunger for the most vulnerable and for promoting medium- to long-term sustainability in agriculture and rural development. In that context, increased international support for the expansion of rural infrastructure is critical.Ms. Flores (Honduras), Vice-President, took the Chair.If we are to maintain our credibility, we must avoid indecisiveness on the issues that aff lict humankind. We are only three short years away from 2015, the year we set for ourselves to reach important goals for improving the security of our planet and enhancing the quality of life for all. We must do what we promised to do and we must do so without delay.Greater alacrity is also needed in the area of politics, where tensions and unrest in many corners of our globe threaten to undermine international peace and security. The tide of democratic change that has swept the planet and raised the expectations of peoples for social progress and better standards of life in an environment of enlarged freedoms is receding. Those legitimate aspirations deserve the respect and encouragement of the Governments concerned and the support of the international community. No people should be denied the right to live in dignity or to live a life free from fear and want. At the same time, we must be careful to guard against the superimposition of agendas based on ulterior designs that are alien to those noble aspirations. While we give solidarity and support where needed, let us not forget that this body crafted an important principle of self-determination.Human rights and fundamental freedoms are best preserved in an environment of peace and security. Respect for the rule of law and tolerance for the faiths and beliefs of all humankind must continue to be the guiding principles through which we build harmonious societies. While we condemn the attacks and insults that the recent film heaped on Islam, we believe that nothing of that nature can justify the murder of diplomats and the violence we have seen. We therefore extend our sympathy to the people and Government 11The myriad challenges affecting our world today pose a formidable test to the multilateral system that embodies our collective aspirations for peace and development. Such challenges tax our collective resolve to act in the best interest of humankind.The United Nations was established at a time when the vast majority of the human family was not represented in its councils and most nations could not speak on their own behalf. That is not the case today. The near universal representativeness of its membership gives the United Nations unparalleled legitimacy among world institutions. The governance of the Organization needs major reform if it is to reflect the realities of the present time and give full expression to the aspirations of the worlds peoples. For the Security Council, the imperative for reform is particularly urgent. I reaffirm Guyanas steadfast support for timely reform of the Council through an expansion in both the permanent and non-permanent categories, with particular regard to the representation of developing countries.The United Nations must also be reformed in a manner that will enhance its contribution to global economic governance, in keeping with the purposes of its Charter. The United Nations has an important role to play in addressing the democracy deficit in decision-making on such matters, which often have far-reaching implications, particularly for small States. Reforming the United Nations along those lines will provide it with greater legitimacy, which is key to its effectiveness in the eyes of the world. That legitimacy will be enhanced by the delivery of results that meet the expectations of the global citizenry in areas where action is most needed.In conclusion, allow me to recognize the great role played by this body over the years in promoting world peace. It has done a lot to contain and resolve regional and local conflicts. In our time, the United Nations has become indispensable in tackling pressing global issues. We must therefore all work together to strengthen the Organization so as to make it more effective in the face of the many challenges that are ahead."}}
