{"speech":{"0":" As always, it is an honour to participate in this Assembly of the peoples of the world, which pursues the ongoing struggle, among others, for the universal principles upheld since 1948. It is here and at this time that we can see that we are different, precisely in this Assembly, which reflects the wealth of our diversity. It is here where we work constantly to overcome our natural differences, respond to our common problems and strengthen the human family through agreed outcomes. The international community must be consistent in that objective. We must be partners and allies at all times, ready to put forward initiatives, solutions and reforms that strengthen the need for close cooperation in the joint responsibility to protect not only the right to that diversity, but also the right to demonstrate it and to fully live it. All must participate in this forum, with no sister nation excluded or not invited. We are called upon to ensure the full recognition of each and every one, with complete security for all. In Honduras, for some years we have acknowledged in all areas the need for a reform process that ensures respect for peoples rights. Our first action, in accordance with our national law, was to invite regional and international organizations to come to Honduras and see our proposals and our work. We have set up a unit to investigate crimes against sexual diversity — lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender — under the Office of the Public Prosecutor. It focuses its attention on vulnerable groups and on furthering dialogue with the broader civil society.On gender issues, the Honduran State has a policy gender progamme, which is a technical and political tool to help women achieve full equality and fairness. My Government supports a 40-per-cent share of women in elected posts in the 2013 electoral campaign and a 50-per cent participation in the following election in 2017. In April, the National Congress of the Republic adopted a law against trafficking in persons. That is a measure of compliance by the State of Honduras with important recommendations on trafficking in persons drawn up by international human rights bodies.As we continue our fight for indigenous peoples, another essential part of our national plan and vision for the country is to put an end to the exclusion of such peoples and those of African descent and to ensure safety. Mistakes in nuclear energy are too costly to be allowed. In that respect, we welcome the actions taken by the International Atomic Energy Agency to improve the existing system of international nuclear safety regulations. Lithuania supports the position that nuclear safety standards should be strengthened and, if needed, legal international imperatives should be adopted. The 2012 Seoul Nuclear Security Summit clearly indicated that nuclear security and nuclear safety measures should be drawn up, implemented and managed in a coherent manner, as they both have a common aim to protect the people and their environment. Keeping the commitment that it assumed at the Summit, my country has contributed to international efforts to increase global awareness of existing energy insecurities and ways to prevent them by establishing the Nuclear Security Centre of Excellence in Lithuania.In order to tackle the causes of conflicts, not just the consequences, we have to be honest players. We must honestly define the problems; speak openly about their reasons; be clear and precise in naming the rules of the game; and, last but not least, find in ourselves the political will to play according to the rules globally, especially once agreed upon."}}
