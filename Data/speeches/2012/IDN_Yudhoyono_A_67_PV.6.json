{"speech":{"0":" May peace be upon us all. I am honoured to represent my country, Indonesia, at this years General Assembly debate to discuss how we can find better ways to peacefully resolve or manage conflicts around the world.This, of course, is what the United Nations is all about: to end the scourge of war, and to create a peaceful and equitable world order based on international cooperation.In the decades since its founding, the United Nations has developed a number of instruments to address conflicts in all their manifestations. During those decades, many inter-State and intra-State conflicts have been resolved — those in Angola, Bosnia, Cambodia, Timor-Leste, as well as many others.The question we must now ask is whether those instruments are adequate to address the whole spectrum of conflicts that the world community now faces.That is clearly evident in the Syrian crisis. The world community is witnessing, with great pain, the worsening violence and unfolding humanitarian catastrophe on the ground; at the same time, the United Nations is in a state of paralysis in responding to the situation. There is no end in sight to the conflict, and it appears that we have not yet seen the worst of the crisis.Indonesia therefore reiterates its call for the immediate cessation of violence in Syria, which has taken a high toll in innocent civilian lives. The Security Council must now unite and act decisively, as mandated by the United Nations Charter, to bring the situation under control.Social Council in the process, and we stand ready to contribute, taking the opportunity of our membership in the Council.In the context of the United Nations development agenda, let me stress that Bulgaria, as an EU member, is deeply committed to the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals and is working to gradually increase its share as a donor of development and humanitarian aid, in compliance with the commitments it has undertaken. During this Assembly session, Bulgaria will sign the Food Assistance Convention.Being myself a strong supporter of greater focus on education as a key area for sustainable development, allow me to express my high appreciation for the initiative of the Secretary-General “Education First”. I am convinced that in a knowledge-based network of economies, education is the best investment in order to prepare young generations for global citizenship. We welcome the designation of UNESCOs Director-General, Mrs. Irina Bokova, as the Executive Secretary for this initiative. In view of her outstanding performance so far, Bulgaria advocates Mrs. Bokovas re-election for a second term at the helm of UNESCO for the period 2013 to 2017.We highly value UNICEFs noble mission to promote childrens rights, safety and well-being. Over the past few years, the role of UNICEF in Bulgaria evolved from the usual technical assistance to a strategic partnership with the Government in order to promote fundamental reforms. In November this year, my country will host a UNICEF-sponsored high-level regional conference on child care system reform.Finally, let me assure the Assembly that Bulgaria will continue to give its full support to the noble cause of building a stronger, rule-based multilateral system with an enhanced role for the United Nations at its centre. Success on that path will be achieved only by working together."}}
