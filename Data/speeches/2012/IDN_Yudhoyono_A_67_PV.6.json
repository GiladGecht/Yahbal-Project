{"speech":{"0":" May peace be upon us all. I am honoured to represent my country, Indonesia, at this years General Assembly debate to discuss how we can find better ways to peacefully resolve or manage conf licts around the world. This, of course, is what the United Nations is all about: to end the scourge of war, and to create a peaceful and equitable world order based on international cooperation. In the decades since its founding, the United Nations has developed a number of instruments to address conf licts in all their manifestations. During those decades, many inter-State and intra-State conf licts have been resolved — those in Angola, Bosnia, Cambodia, Timor-Leste, as well as many others. The question we must now ask is whether those instruments are adequate to address the whole spectrum of conf licts that the world community now faces. That is clearly evident in the Syrian crisis. The world community is witnessing, with great pain, the worsening violence and unfolding humanitarian catastrophe on the ground; at the same time, the United Nations is in a state of paralysis in responding to the situation. There is no end in sight to the conf lict, and it appears that we have not yet seen the worst of the crisis. Indonesia therefore reiterates its call for the immediate cessation of violence in Syria, which has taken a high toll in innocent civilian lives. The Security Council must now unite and act decisively, as mandated by the United Nations Charter, to bring the situation under control. 33 Clearly, whatever the explanation, the present international system cannot for now resolve the Syrian conf lict. There is every likelihood that the community of nations will see similar conf licts in future. It will be in a different corner of the world, and in a different form, with different actors. It will not help the cause of international peace if, once again, we end up being divided and unable to positively alter the course of the conf lict. The world community must develop ways to address them more effectively, towards their peaceful end. We must adapt to twenty-first century security challenges. There is no question that the world we live in today is in much better condition than it was in the twentieth century. Freedom has spread. The threat of nuclear holocaust is receding significantly. There is no prospect of a world war, the kind that twice created such destruction during the twentieth century. The global economy has expanded remarkably. Nations are becoming more interdependent. International cooperation and partnerships are f lourishing. However, it is only relative peace, not total peace as yet. We have moved from the era of the cold war to an era of “warm peace”. In this warm peace, the world remains stuck with an outdated international security architecture twentieth-century circumstances, in contrast with the global economic architecture, which has done much better in adjusting to the twenty-first century. ref lects that still In this warm peace, the relationships between the major Powers are, for the first time, marked by relative stability and increased cooperation. But the question remains unanswered as to how they will accommodate the growing ranks of emerging Powers that are reshaping the world order. In this warm peace, old enmities and long-standing conf licts can still resurface in the new strategic landscape, even carried on by new generations. In this warm peace, we are seeing new security challenges and opportunities arising from the seismic power shifts that are occurring in some regions. The security implications of the political events in the Middle East are still unfolding. In this warm peace, the world community still has to contend with an array of unfinished business: the Arab-Israeli conf lict, nuclear disarmament, territorial disputes in the South China Sea, tensions in the Korean peninsula, and the like. In this warm peace, new progress can easily regress. Hard-won peace processes can stall or even crumble. Strategic miscalculations in disputed theatres may lead to rising tensions and armed clashes. And in this warm peace, pockets of hatred and bigotry, intolerance and extremism continue to litter our world. Perhaps we will have to live with this warm peace for decades. But I believe that we can lower the temperature of this warm peace. Where possible, we can resolve conf licts one by one. We can strengthen the building blocks of peace. We can promote a new globalism that can potentially change the dynamics of conf lict resolution. In order to do that, we need to try new approaches and be more imaginative. The first thing we have to do is to evolve a new strategic mindset. Let us face it: remnants of the cold-war mentality still persist in parts of the geopolitical landscape, not least in our own United Nations, where rigid, dogmatic, zero-sum calculations sometimes still come into play. For long-term peace, a peace born of trust and mutual confidence, we must get rid of that mindset. In that light, we must continue to work towards a reformed Security Council, a Council that ref lects the strategic realities of the twenty-first century and provides security to all. We must also work to perfect the instruments of peace, which include robust regionalism. We in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have seen how such regionalism can be a force for peace and cooperation. As a result of a strong regionalism, all of South-east Asia has thrived under ASEAN cooperation. South-east Asia, which was once the cockpit of border wars and the proxy wars of extra-regional Powers, has come together. After ASEAN was founded, in 1967, it devoted the early decades of its life as a regional organization to cultivating the habits of dialogue, consultation and cooperation, not only among its members but with its dialogue partners. Thus, each ASEAN country adopted a new strategic mindset based on trust and a sense of having a stake in the success and progress of all the others. Today the ASEAN family is united and at peace with itself and with the rest of the world. 34 Finally, the culture of peace, mutual tolerance and appreciation, and cooperation must be supported by the right kind of economics. People need to be fed, to be sheltered and to be assured of a future where they have opportunities for a living and a livelihood. That is the only way for peace to be locked in for the long term; that is, when it brings dividends that give human beings robust confidence in the future. The price of inequality between and within nations gives rise to tension born of grievances that can, unless effectively addressed, lead to radicalism and even violence, which threaten international and national peace and security. The solution is to form a global partnership for poverty eradication and for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and then to formulate a post-MDG development agenda we can fully carry out. Our experience in the resolution of the intra-state conf lict in the province of Aceh proves that, if we do enough for peace, if there is a conf luence of favourable circumstances, and if we are prepared to seize the moment, then peace can be achieved. The peace that we achieve will not only give temporary respite, it will also last for generations. For many years, peace has been treated as if it were a science. There are whole libraries about how it can be achieved and preserved. I have come to the conclusion, however, that if peace has a technology it is one born of experience. That experience can be shared and can be useful in creating new experience. And if there is enough sharing of experiences — and that is what Indonesia is trying to achieve — and if there is sufficient political will to apply what is learned from others to ones unique circumstances, then peace can be widely spread. Peace can be effectively waged. And we would have a gentler, better world. "}}
