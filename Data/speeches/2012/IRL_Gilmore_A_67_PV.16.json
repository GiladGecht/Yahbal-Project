Ireland will be proud to support a fair and balanced resolution to that end, and we look forward to the forthcoming consultations.We know of course that such steps will not alter the situation on the ground. Israel must stop expanding settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which only impede the prospect of achieving Israels own stated desire for a Palestinian State. The peace and security of the people of Israel, to which they are entitled, gain nothing from denying the basic rights of the people of Gaza, who are subjected to an unjust and counterproductive blockade.There is no alternative to serious negotiations between the two sides aimed at a comprehensive settlement. I would like to see President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu commit themselves to achieving a comprehensive peace agreement within a specified timescale. That will not be easy and will require painful compromises on both sides. But if both leaders are willing to embark on that path they will have the unstinting support of the entire international community, including Ireland.Peace and security are inextricably linked to development. And development is at the heart of Irelands foreign policy. We have maintained our official development assistance above 0.5 per cent of gross national product — an important achievement in the face of major economic difficulties — and we remain committed to reaching the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent as soon as we possibly can.Irelands aid programme represents a genuine investment by the Irish people in the world we share with the people of developing countries. We focus in particular on the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We have prioritized investments in education, in health, in good governance, and in the lives and rights of girls and women and of persons living with HIV and AIDS. We have seen remarkable economic progress made in African countries as a result of such investments. But great inequalities still persist.It is in all our interests as global citizens to stay the course in relation to the Millennium Development Goals and to continue to work together for a sustainable and just world in which States operate on the basis of the rights of all people to participate in and contribute to society and inclusive economies.about an end to their suffering and to achieve an early political transition. Ireland backs the Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and the League of Arab Nations, Lakhdar Brahimi, in his difficult task. The priority must be to achieve an immediate ceasefire and to get a political process under way that will facilitate the transition.What is needed, above all, is a strong Security Council resolution that will authorize targeted sanctions. It must include a comprehensive arms embargo against all those who are responsible for violating the human rights of the Syrian people. That is what the Syrian people want from us, and what they have a right to expect.There must also be full accountability for human rights abuses. To prevent further atrocities now and to save lives now, we must make it clear now that atrocities will not go unpunished. That is why Ireland supports the call by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and by Switzerland and others for the Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. We are working to build up strong cross-regional support for such a referral.If the events in the Arab world over the past two years have taught us anything, it is that leaders who deny legitimate demands for greater political and economic freedom and who instead resort to waging war on their own people will inevitably lose the right to rule. The systematic denial of human rights and suppression of democratic liberties has fuelled a profound desire for change. In Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Bahrain and elsewhere, Ireland has supported the will of the people, peacefully expressed, to bring about long-overdue democratic reforms.As world attention focuses on Syria, peace and justice remain elusive elsewhere in the Middle East. The need for a lasting resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict is as urgent as ever. Yet a depressing stalemate persists, with no progress towards a comprehensive settlement. Ireland has said on many occasions that the establishment of a Palestinian State, within borders based on those of 1967, is long overdue. We have made clear our hope that Palestine will be formally admitted to the United Nations as a full Member. While that hope remains to be fulfilled, we welcome the announcement by President Abbas of his plans to consult with the membership of the General Assembly on a resolution that, as an interim step towards the achievement of 14 A deep attachment to the safeguarding of human rights has been at the heart of Irelands foreign policy since the foundation of our State. Irelands commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights has been shaped by our own history. As a small island nation that has experienced the impact of colonialism, civil war and conflict, we learned the hard way that human rights can never be taken for granted.From the earliest days of our United Nations membership, we pioneered the promotion of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. We also paid close attention to decolonization and the struggle against apartheid. Today, we make substantial contributions to United Nations development agencies and funds and are active participants in United Nations peacekeeping operations. Thousands of Irishmen and Irishwomen have served in United Nations peacekeeping forces, and our people are intensely proud of that contribution to the ideals of the United Nations.Ireland also plays an active role in the work being done in the United Nations framework to protect and promote human rights. We are proud that our former President, Mary Robinson, served with distinction as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights from 1997 to 2002. When the Human Rights Council was first established in 2006, Ireland declared that it would seek election to that body in 2012. That is the first occasion on which we have sought election to the Council.We are committed to a robust and effective Human Rights Council. We want to see a principled Council that provides real leadership in that critical area. We also value and support the full participation of small States in the work of the Council. The Universal Periodic Review process has opened up an important space for national dialogue on human rights. Ireland engaged constructively and self-critically in its own review. We are also firmly committed to a strengthened United Nations treaty monitoring body system and have actively contributed to efforts to reinforce that system.Threats to human rights worldwide are proliferating steadily, whether from widespread poverty and hunger, repressive systems of governance, religious intolerance, gender-based violence or other sources. If Ireland is elected to the Human Rights Council in November, we will serve the cause of international human rights protection as an active and committed member of the Council.Against that background, the reality of hunger persists in our world. The scandal is that we have the tools to tackle that suffering and that terrible waste of human potential. How can people realize their rights and potential if they cannot meet their most basic needs for existence?No country knows that better than Somalia. Once, Somalia was at the centre of the worlds attention. But the media spotlight moved on, and the people of Somalia have faced a long struggle to emerge from war, famine and instability. Today, more than two million Somalis still need our help. On the last Sunday of July 2012, I visited Mogadishu. Amidst the grinding poverty and the misery of insecurity, I saw genuine signs of hope and opportunity. Schools, homes, shops and businesses are being rebuilt and reopened, and people are returning from exile. Increased international engagement has been essential. Real progress is also being achieved in Somalias transition to democracy, with impressive engagement by Somali traditional and political leaders. We must support them.I pledge today that Ireland will not turn away from Somalia or from humanitarian emergencies elsewhere in the Horn of Africa, the Sahel and across the globe. We will work with our partners to highlight forgotten crises and the needs of fragile States, as well as to forge a more coherent and effective international approach towards humanitarian action and development policy.Ireland has made the fight against hunger and undernourishment the key priority of its development policy. We have delivered on our commitment to direct 20 per cent of our aid budget to that priority. With our partners, we have worked closely with the Secretary-General to build and support the Scaling Up Nutrition movement. But we must do more. Collectively, we must act now to recognize the systemic linkages between recurring food price crises, humanitarian emergencies, chronic undernourishment and the effects of climate change.There is nothing that connects us more across borders, across oceans and across generations than our mutual dependence on the planet that we share. Climate change is not something happening in a far-off land or in a distant future. It is happening now and it is happening fast. It is not for another generation to solve. It is for us to take responsibility, to strive to achieve climate justice, and to act. 15of the United Nations as a multilateral forum for addressing todays crises and challenges. The conflicts in Syria and Mali and the ongoing reform processes in many parts of the Arab world demonstrate that we can face such challenges only through concerted action.In Syria, thousands have lost their lives in their struggle for freedom and reform owing to crimes committed by a regime that denies them every basic human right in order to stay in power. Austria condemns the systematic human rights violations and bloodshed in Syria in the strongest possible terms. The more than 27,000 victims and some 2.5 million people in dire need of humanitarian assistance are a stark reminder for each and every one of us that it is high time for the United Nations to finally act. The Security Council, in particular, must assume its responsibilities in relation to the ever-worsening situation in the country. Violence has to stop immediately, and both sides have to engage in a meaningful dialogue facilitated by Joint Special Representative Lakhdar Brahimi. There will be no solution unless President Al-Assad steps aside and gives way to the forces of reason and reconciliation.Austria continues to fully support the ongoing transition processes in the Arab world. We welcome the efforts undertaken so far to lay the foundations for more open, inclusive and prosperous societies. We encourage the newly empowered authorities to fulfil their mandate for democratic change responsibly. The aspirations of the people for dignity and freedom must be satisfied, thereby contributing to peace and stability in the region.In that context, let me reiterate my strongest condemnation of the recent attacks on diplomatic missions and personnel, especially the murder of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three of his colleagues in Benghazi. Violence is never an acceptable response to the exercise of the fundamental right of freedom of speech. To attack an Embassy and its personnel is not only contrary to international law but an attack on the very ideals that the United Nations stands for, namely, the peaceful cooperation of Member States to build a better future together.The still unresolved Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to gravely destabilize the Middle East. The terms of a negotiated and sustainable solution — two States with secure and mutually recognized borders — have been discussed over and over again and are broadly supported by the people and The United Nations was founded on the principle that diplomatic engagement and dialogue between nations are essential to peace and human development. Attacks on diplomatic missions, such as we saw recently in Benghazi, are attacks on that principle. They are never acceptable and must be condemned by the international community.Ireland is currently chairing the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). That has enabled us to make a contribution to the search for agreement across the full range of the OSCEs activities. We have drawn on our own experience in building peace in Northern Ireland to contribute to the work of the OSCE, which seeks to find peaceful settlements to protracted conflicts. I am hopeful that by the end of our term in office we will have been able to make progress in some key areas, including in the so-called human dimension of the OSCE and on some conflict issues.We have used our chairmanship to prioritize Internet freedom, reflecting the increasing importance of the Internet as a platform for the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms. A major conference in Dublin last June focused on how human rights and fundamental freedoms do not change with new technologies, but extend seamlessly into the digital age. We look forward to assuming the presidency of the European Union Council of Ministers in the first half of next year. We will bring to that role the same energy and commitment that we have devoted to discharging our OSCE responsibilities.A distinguished Irish politician and lawyer of the late eighteenth century, John Philpot Curran, once remarked that “the price of liberty is eternal vigilance”. If we are to live up to the aspirations of the Charter of the United Nations, we must also assume the burden of eternal vigilance. The daily challenges to human rights are painfully obvious. Our response must be clear and unrelenting. In the words of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the promotion and protection of human rights is “the first responsibility” of Governments. We cannot and must not shy from that responsibility."}}
