{"speech":{"0":" Today, in the Assembly, the Prime Minister of the notorious Israeli regime made a series of entirely baseless allegations against my country. At this late hour, I do not wish to take the precious time of my colleagues to reply to such unfounded statements, which I will not dignify with an answer other than to categorically reject them, in particular regarding the nuclear programme of my country, which is exclusively peaceful and in full conformity with our international obligations and undertaken in exercise of our inalienable right to use nuclear science and technology for peaceful purposes. I also do not wish to take the valuable time of my colleagues to explain the very well-known history and record of my country — a country that has no record of aggression in its centuries-long history; a country that 40 all this irresponsible behaviour in a volatile region such as the Middle East.Finally, for the second time in the recent history of the United Nations, today, in the General Assembly, an unfounded and imaginary graph was used to justify a threat against a founding Member of the Organization. It is worth mentioning, however, in our increasingly interconnected world, and in the information age, it is hardly possible for nations to be fooled by such absurd devices. It is evident that no amount of slanderous deception or smear campaigning by the Zionist regime can obscure its dark history or divert attention from the reality.Mr. Kodama (Japan): My delegation would like to exercise its right of reply in response to the statement made by the representative of the Peoples Republic of China on the issue of the Senkaku Islands.In his address in the general debate (), Mr. Noda, the Prime Minister of Japan, stressed that various international issues should be solved by reason rather than force. He has also repeatedly pointed out the importance of the rule of law, which is one of the foundations of global peace, stability and prosperity, and that any attempt to achieve a countrys ideological aims or claims by the unilateral use of force or the threat of force is inconsistent with the fundamental spirit of the United Nations Charter.The Cabinet of the Government of Japan made a decision in January 1895 to formally incorporate the Senkaku Islands into the territory of Japan, while the island of Formosa and the islands appertaining or belong to it were ceded to Japan in accordance with the Treaty of Shimonoseki, signed in April 1895. It is therefore clear at the outset that the assertion that Japan took the islands from China cannot logically stand. In any case, Japan had been conducting thorough surveys of the Senkaku Islands since 1885. Those surveys confirmed that the Senkaku Islands were not only uninhabited but showed no trace of having been under Chinas control. Based on that information, Japan formally incorporated the Senkaku Islands into its territory.Japan renounced territorial sovereignty over the island of Formosa — Taiwan — and the Pescadores, ceded by China after the Sino-Japanese war, in accordance with article 2 (b) of the San Francisco Peace Treaty. It was made clear, however, that the Senkaku Islands were not included with Formosa and the Pescadores, by the fact that the United States Taking into account these realities, and the Final Document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference (NPCONF.20 (Vol.1)), adopted by consensus, 189 States party to the NPT, including the United States and other significant supporters of the Zionist regime, unanimously appealed to that regime, by name, to accede to the NPT without conditions, and to put all its clandestine nuclear activities under international safeguards.Now the Prime Minister of the regime has shamelessly and hypocritically raised an outcry, and, by his baseless and absurd allegations about my countrys exclusively peaceful nuclear programmes, tried to abuse the tribune of the General Assembly to distract Member States attention from the danger of its nuclear arsenals, clandestine nuclear programme and unsafeguarded nuclear facilities, which are the only source of threats to peace, security and stability in the Middle East and beyond. Instead of making baseless allegations against other countries in the region, this regime must obey the repeated demands of the international community and accede promptly and without conditions to the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon party, as well as to place all its nuclear-related facilities under the comprehensive International Atomic Energy Agency verification system.The international community should also continue to exert all possible pressure on this regime, particularly during the upcoming 2012 NPT-related Conference on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, in order to force it to abide by international demands. Similarly, this regime, which is also not a party to WMD-related treaties other than the NPT, and which, by developing weapons of mass destruction, tries to solve its inherent legitimacy problems, must be compelled to comply fully with all its international obligations.While the use or threat of use of force on any pretext is a grave violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law, as well as the norms of international relations, the officials of the Israeli regime, who, rude as they are, threaten countries in the region, particularly my country, with military attack on a daily basis. Iran has the strength to defend itself, and reserves its full right to retaliate with full force against any attack. At the same time, the international community should live up to its responsibilities and exert pressure on this regime to end 41international obligations in good faith, one of which was to return to China all the territories, including the Diaoyu islands, that Japan had stolen. However, despite the many years that have gone by, the Japanese Government still clings to its obsolete colonial mindset, breaches its international obligations time and again, and attempts to continue to occupy the Diaoyu islands. The recent so-called island purchase by the Government is no different than money laundering. Its purpose is to legitimize its stealing and occupation of Chinese territory through illegal means and to confuse international public opinion and deceive the people of the world. Japans action constitutes a serious encroachment upon Chinas sovereignty, with Japan intending to continue its occupation and legitimize the fruits of its colonial policy. It is an open denial of the outcomes of the victory of the world anti-fascist war and a grave challenge to the post-war international order and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Any illegal act, no matter how it is packaged, is illegal in nature and never generates rights. That is a basic principle of international law. Japans act falls into that category and is utterly illegal and void. It will never change the fact that the Diaoyu islands are part of Chinas territory, nor will it ever shake Chinas resolve to safeguard its territorial integrity and sovereignty over the Diaoyu islands and their affiliated islands. The Government and the people of China will never waver in their will and determination to uphold Chinas territorial integrity and sovereignty. China is capable of safeguarding the integrity of its territory. The Chinese Government urges the Japanese side to put an immediate halt to all acts that undermine Chinas territorial integrity and sovereignty.Mr. Kodama (Japan): There is no doubt that the Senkaku islands are an inherent territory of Japan, based on historical fact and international law. Indeed, the Senkaku islands are clearly under Japans legitimate control. Chinas assertions have no grounds at all. In any case, there exists no territorial sovereignty issue to be resolved with respect to the Senkaku islands. I refrain from entering into any more detailed rebuttal of the statement made by the delegation of the Peoples Republic of China. The position of the Government of Japan on the issue is as stated previously.Mr. Li Baodong (China) (spoke in Chinese): China firmly opposes the statement made by the Japanese of America actually exercised administrative rights over the Senkaku Islands, as part of the Nansei Shoto southwest islands, in accordance with article 3 of the Peace Treaty, and the islands were explicitly included in the areas whose administrative rights reverted to Japan in 1972.It was only in the 1970s that the Government of China and the Taiwanese authorities began making their own assertions of territorial sovereignty over the Senkaku Islands, which are part of Japans inherent territory. Until then they had never expressed any objections to Japan, nor did they protest the fact that the islands were included in the area over which the United States exercised administrative rights in accordance with article 3 of the San Francisco Peace Treaty. The posture of simply attributing this difference of opinion between the two countries to the past war is not just unconvincing and unproductive; it is also a way to evade the essence of the issue.Mr. Li Baodong (China) (spoke in Chinese): On the question of the Diaoyu islands, the Japanese representative once again brazenly distorted history and resorted to spurious, fallacious arguments that defy all reason and logic to justify their aggression of Chinese territory. Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr. Yang Jiechi reiterated Chinas firm position on the Diaoyu Dao issue in the statement he made to the General Assembly. That position is consistent and clear-cut. The Diaoyu islands and their affiliated islands have been an integral part of Chinas territory since ancient times, and China has indisputable historical and jurisprudential evidence to support that claim. Japan waged an expansionist war of aggression against China at the end of the nineteenth century. In the same way that other colonial countries grabbed and occupied the land of many countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, Japan stole Taiwan and its affiliated islands, including the Diaoyu islands, from China through that war and began its colonial rule over them. During the Second World War, China, the United States and the United Kingdom issued the Cairo Declaration, which clearly stipulated that one of the purposes of the three countries in fighting that war was to make sure that all the territories that Japan had stolen from the Chinese would be restored to China. The Potsdam Declaration and the Japanese Instrument of Surrender issued in 1945 further confirmed that Japan, as a defeated country, would have to honour its 42 The Japanese act is a rejection of international efforts to end colonialism, an outright denial of the victorious defeat of Japan in the world anti-fascist war and a grave challenge to the post-war international order and international law. China is firmly opposed to that position. China will continue to take resolute and forceful measures to unswervingly safeguard Chinese territorial integrity and sovereignty. The current situation has been caused by the Japanese side singlehandedly. Japan must respect history, face reality, discard illusions, refrain from daydreaming, honour its international obligations, take concrete measures to redress its mistakes and stop all acts that violate and undermine Chinas sovereignty"}}
