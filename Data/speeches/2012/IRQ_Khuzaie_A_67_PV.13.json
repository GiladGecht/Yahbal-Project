{"speech":{"0":" I stand here today in order to convey to the General Assembly the sincere regards and best wishes of the people of Iraq, who wish to share in forging closer bonds of amity and cooperation between peoples and countries, at a time when my country is undergoing a structural transformation at every level, a process that will enable it to reform itself, achieve its goals and consolidate its gains.We are building a future through the conscious understanding of our history as the cradle of civilization and where the earliest writing system and codifi cation of laws were born. Iraq has been successful in establishing a democratic, pluralistic and federalist State on the basis of an enlightened Constitution, drafted by our peoples representatives and voted on by our people.Our Constitution lays out the aspirations of our people to a free and decent life based on freedom, democracy and the peaceful transfer of authority, citizenship and human rights. Iraq has regained its security, political and economic health in record time and under extremely difficult conditions, where the forces of darkness had been betting that terrorism would derail the experiment. However, thanks to God and the patriotic vigour and self-awareness of our nation, our people were able to turn the page. Our efforts are based on a cultural history of about 10,000 years and on a great human legacy created by the heavenly messages 22 which only leads to more violence, bloodshed and loss of life. The situation is endangering the social fabric of the Syrian people and may lead to fragmentation and disintegration of that people, whom we cherish and whose unity and sovereignty we care about.We also realize that the facts on the ground suggest that regional and international intervention could adversely impact the Syrian issue and might cause unlimited chaos and devastation that would spare no one, including the interveners. We therefore sincerely call for dialogue and a peaceful solution as the only means to end a crisis that could engulf the whole region and exacerbate the current situation.The events in Syria have demonstrated that resolving the crisis through violence and force could double the costs incurred by the Syrians and the region, for such means only increase the suffering of civilians, destroy infrastructure and multiply the number of displaced persons and refugees. That is why we hope that all the parties to the conflict understand that the military solution alone is a dangerous move and gamble. From this rostrum, we call upon kings, presidents and other heads of State here today at this humanitarian gathering to support reconciliation and dialogue among all Syrians and endorse the United Nations and Arab League initiative promoted by Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi after the noble efforts of Mr. Kofi Annan reached at an impasse.In that regard, we do not hide our concern about the consequences of the ongoing crisis, which could only worsen if sectarian and ethnic strife is triggered. That, in turn, could lead the region and its peoples into a spiral of fighting with no end on the horizon. Such a prospect makes it incumbent upon us on us to try in earnest to contain and peacefully resolve the crisis, while preserving the interests of the Syrian people and preventing further deterioration of the situation.Iraqs initiative aimed at resolving the Syrian crisis continues to stand as a beacon of peace, as we search for an exit acceptable to all the forces of good. Our initiative is based on the following two points. First, Iraq has a keen desire to see Syria remain intact as a State, and we support the hopes and aspirations of the Syrian people for a free and dignified life. Secondly, Iraq is concerned at the possible repercussions of the violence and destruction caused by Syrias internal war and sectarian strife, which we fear could have a spillover effect.investment law itself and through Iraqs accession to the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency in 2007 and through bilateral treaties to guarantee and protect investments.We were able to establish solid foundations for political conduct, which has matured rapidly as our people have grown to accept those unlike themselves and to live according to the principle of citizenship, the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary and the freedom of expression. We proudly announce that, owing to our freedom of opinion and expression, we do not have a single prisoner jailed for his beliefs or opinions. In our fight against terrorism, human rights remain a cherished principle that we respect and promote as a just cause. We do not have any justification to tamper with such rights.It is true that confronting terrorism has cost Iraq a lot of blood, tears, sweat and financial resources, but that confrontation has rewarded our people with a permanent immunity against violence. It has also created extreme sensitivity vis-a-vis violence as a means to resolve our strife with others. Therefore, as much as we care about sparing our people the ravages of fighting, we hope that other countries, especially neighbouring countries, will learn from the Iraqi experience and spare their peoples unnecessary turmoil. We call upon them to adopt the principle of negotiation to resolve conflicts and the use of dialogue, logic, reason, laws and the peaceful transfer of power.That is the essence of Iraqs position regarding the revolutions of the Arab Spring, which we cannot do anything about except to be entirely on the side of the people and their legitimate aspirations, their right to self-determination and the right to choose their own rulers. We share the concerns regarding the issues facing the peoples and States Members of the Organization; those concerns represent a humanitarian, legal and moral burden, because all of us share one world, which is affected by conflicts and their aftermath.Based on that, the Syrian issue and the humanitarian diffi culties facing civilians in that country occupy a great deal of our attention. We think that the escalating violence in Syria is a reason for distress and concern, and it is incumbent upon the leaders gathered here to work in earnest to stop the bloodshed, which claims the lives of tens and perhaps hundreds of people every day in Syria. We would like also to draw attention to the danger of providing the fighting parties with weapons, 23balanced and responsible spirit that characterizes Iraqs clear position with respect to that issue. It is a position that declares our firm support for international efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, while affirming the right of peoples and countries to benefit from the peaceful use of nuclear energy.We call upon the international community, represented by the United Nations and its Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, whom we highly respect and revere, to extend support to Iraqs efforts to exit from the Chapter VII provisions imposed on us as a result of the mistaken policies of the former regime following Iraqs invasion of Kuwait, especially as there is no longer any justification for such international action. Iraq is no longer a threat to anyone and has fulfilled most of its obligations, as is confirmed by the renewal of our brotherly relations with the State of Kuwait, seen specifically in the mutual visits of high-level officials of our respective countries and the serious and constructive dialogue based on a sincere desire and sustained efforts to resolve all outstanding issues between us. I would be remiss if I failed to speak of the repulsive abuse directed at the great Prophet Muhammad — peace be upon him — and the wave of violent protests that shook the Islamic world because of a ridiculous movie that attacked the image of our Prophet — peace be upon him — a movie that nearly caused relations between East and West to unravel. We need to conduct a sincere and serious examination on how to prevent the recurrence of such insults through an international ban that criminalizes those who insult religions, disrespect religious symbols or insult the great prophets and messengers. Such actions constitute a blatant aggression against everything great, holy and sacred. The recurrence of those obscene actions will supply terrorists with prime material for recruiting angry youth for use in violent actions that threaten peace and security, which could cause many casualties, as recent events have shown. We therefore clearly need to contain such attacks and prohibit the production and dissemination of similar provocative materials. As nobody in the Islamic world is able to contain the consequences of such disregard for Islamic values and their sanctity, we believe that the United Nations should play a central and constructive role in this matter, with a view to preventing potentially far-reaching and dangerous ramifications.Iraqs unwavering and well-known position does not deviate from the Arab ranks on issues of crucial importance to our Arab nation. We accordingly support the establishment of the State of Palestine in the occupied Palestinian territories, with Jerusalem as its capital, and declare our support for the membership of the State of Palestine in the United Nations. We also declare our unequivocal rejection of the policies of oppression, Judaization and usurpation of land that Israel pursues without regard for international condemnation of its unjust practices, including the use of brutal force. We also reject Israels disregard for the repeated international calls to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to place its military arsenal and facilities under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. We have tirelessly called for the establishment in our region of a zone without nuclear weapons. Therefore, within the international framework, we are contributing to efforts to implement a Middle East zone free of all weapons of mass destruction, chief among which are nuclear weapons. That is why we endorse the preparations for the Helsinki conference to be held this year with a view to setting up a process that would set up such a zone. Any failure in that endeavour would lead to an arms race in a region that is in dire need of peace and stability. We condemn and reject the discriminatory policies pursued against religious and ethnic minorities in many countries the world over. We especially condemn the inhumane violations of the rights of Muslims in Myanmar, who face genocide. The worlds conscience should not remain untroubled by the gravity of their plight. Such situations run counter to all the principles of human rights law, religious teachings and international conventions.Our good and friendly relations with our neighbours, the region and the entire world are governed by a balanced foreign policy based on mutual respect, common interests and non-interference in the affairs of others. We also uphold the principles of good-neighbourliness and dialogue in our relations with the Arab and Muslim worlds, as well as with the entire world. Iraq hosted the League of Arab States Summit in March, which marked a return to our active, natural and pioneering role in joint Arab decision-making and action. That was followed by Iraqs hosting of one of the rounds of international negotiations on the Iranian nuclear issue, which we undertook in the objective, 24 accorded to our President when he addressed the Assembly last year. He made that address at the time when the international community was concerned about the viability of our new nation. In the light of the progress we have made and despite recent events, I am pleased to address the Assembly this year under the theme of the sixty-seventh session “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means”.The Republic of South Sudan achieved its independence peacefully, through the exercise of the right of self-determination by the people of South Sudan in an internationally supervised referendum, as stipulated in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). The international community played an important role in this, our independence process. We are therefore very thankful to all those who helped us achieve independence, not least the United Nations.Our declaration of independence on 9 July 2011 did not resolve all the issues between us and the predecessor State, the Republic of the Sudan. These unresolved, post-independence issues include border demarcation, oil infrastructure, security and the final status of the Abyei Area. The bilateral engagement between the two countries failed to achieve an agreement. As a result, the African Union intervened by mandating the African Union High-level Implementation Panel, under former President Thabo Mbeki, to facilitate negotiations between the two parties.As the situation continued to deteriorate, the Security Council intervened and adopted resolution 2046 (2012). That resolution sets out a clear road map for resolving all the remaining differences between the Sudan and South Sudan, including Abyei, and addresses the conflicts in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile.Before I discuss the developments in the talks in Addis Ababa, allow me to also brief the Assembly on other issues of importance such as State-building, food security, public service reform, access to education, security and accountability in my country.We have embarked upon laying a secure foundation for a prosperous, democratic and stable nation by establishing institutions at the national, state and local Government levels for governance and the delivery of services to the people. We believe that food security is not a privilege but a basic right of each and every citizen in South Sudan. No citizen should go hungry. As the saying goes, a hungry man is an angry man. It In conclusion, we, the people and Government of Iraq, extend our hand to the other Member States with a view to increased collaboration aimed at achieving our common goals. Those are noble goals, based on lofty principles and cherished human values, and honour all human beings as supremely deserving of leading a free and safe life and enjoying fundamental freedoms. We hope that when we meet again our world will be a safer place, our peoples will enjoy better conditions and the international climate will have improved."}}
