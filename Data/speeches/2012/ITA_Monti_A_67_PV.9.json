{"speech":{"0":" I wish to warmly congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. Rest assured that you have Italys full support as you assume your crucial responsibilities in the service of international peace and cooperation.Every day and everywhere, people strive to overcome fear, achieve justice and persevere through hardship and uncertainty to protect their families and livelihoods and to ensure a better future for their children. Governments strive to achieve and preserve peace, justice and prosperity in a world gripped by political tensions, civil wars and a severe economic and financial crisis.54 relevant Security Council resolutions. Italy advocates more effective arms control regimes, and looks forward to concrete nuclear disarmament measures as proposed in President Obamas Prague appeal.Respect for the rule of law is the basic condition for promoting human rights and maintaining international peace and security. In that context, Mr. President, I welcome your proposal of “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means” as the overarching theme for this session of the General Assembly. I am also pleased to announce that Italy is now ready to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in accordance with Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Courts Statute. This is a defining moment for the International Court of Justice and for international jurisdictions in general, since they are the key institutions for interpreting international law and guaranteeing global compliance with its provisions. More and more, effective actions to assure international order and security demand respect for international law. The same holds true for actions to counter new threats, such as piracy, which is particularly troubling given its impact on the world economy and on the lives of seafarers. International efforts to protect sea lanes and fight piracy can be effective only if all nations cooperate in good faith, according to the established rules of international customary law and United Nations conventions, including those protecting the jurisdiction of the f lag State in international waters.The Organization can expect no less from each Member State, and especially from those Members that aim to have a decisive influence on the rules of global governance. Any erosion of the sending States exclusive jurisdiction over servicemen on official duty would jeopardize the status of our agents on international missions. Consequently, it would also undermine the sustainability of United Nations peacekeeping missions.By the same token, we must not tolerate any breach of diplomatic missions, whose inviolability must be respected. We firmly condemn any proposition that violence is an acceptable response to speech.Transnational organized crime also requires a collective response grounded in the rule of law and the principle of shared responsibility. With the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Italy has actively contributed to, and co-financed with Colombia, a contribution jointly with our partners and the States of the region.The ultimate goals of peace and cooperation will be achieved only if all the countries concerned work together on the basis of mutual respect and a shared sense of purpose. A culture of dialogue must prevail over confrontation. Extremism and intolerance must be isolated and rejected. Rights, dignity and opportunities must be offered to every component and member of our societies, especially minorities and women.Italy is fully committed to implementing such a vision. For us, protecting and promoting human rights is a long-standing domestic commitment as well as a fundamental pillar of our foreign policy. In that vein, we shall continue to pursue the universal abolition of the death penalty, the protection of minorities, the advancement of the status of women and the free and safe expression of religion or belief. We need to cooperate wisely in firmly rejecting the misrepresentation of religions or beliefs as an instrument of disruption and destabilization.To achieve that goal, good laws are always necessary, but they are not always enough. Tolerance must be promoted through educational programmes and consistent grass-roots work, engaging the efforts of both Governments and civil society. I strongly encourage the membership of the Assembly and all relevant international organizations to resolutely pursue such an approach.The Arab Spring has experienced difficulties, yet it has also scored a number of remarkable achievements. Nothing is easy, yet nothing is impossible. But nothing can be achieved without goodwill and good faith, which we will need if we want to put an end to the ongoing massacres and the massive human rights violations in Syria. The regime in Damascus refuses to comply with the resolutions of the Security Council, and it continues to commit indiscriminate violence against civilians. Italy fully supports the mission of the new Joint Special Representative for Syria and strongly urges the Security Council to overcome the stalemate that is preventing effective international action. History will not be lenient in judging those who bear responsibilities.Nor can we underestimate the increasing danger of nuclear proliferation. Italy supports the commitment of the International Atomic Energy Agency to obtaining clarification of the true nature of the Iranian nuclear programme. We urge Iran to fully comply with all the 55sustainable development — the social, economic and environmental — will be part of the scenarios we face in the future. We will also have to work within the framework of the new Busan Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation.In the area of climate change, sound and balanced management of land and marine resources, involving strengthened trans-boundary cooperation, deserves closer political attention and common application. Some challenges are particularly pressing. Tackling climate change through coordinated emissions-reduction policies is a prerequisite to substantially reducing, and possibly stopping, the serious degradation of planet Earths fragile ecosystems, on which our lives depend. In line with our joint strategic objectives to overcome the financial crisis, we attach great importance to innovative sources of financing for development. Italy has helped promote a number of significant initiatives, in particular in the health field. Migrant remittances play a key role in the development of many countries. That process will be facilitated by achieving the commitments of the Group of Eight (G-8) and the Group of 20 to reduce the average global cost of transferring remittances.Food security is a priority for the Italian Governments development assistance policy. In 2009, under Italys presidency, the G-8 adopted the LAquila Food Security Initiative, a new and inclusive mechanism that has been joined by more than 40 countries and has funded several food security projects amounting to an estimated $22 billion. We are still paying careful attention to policies aimed at mitigating the effect of agricultural price volatility. The availability of high-quality, healthy and sustainable food for all humankind is the historical and concrete challenge being taken up by Expo 2015 in Milan. The theme “Feeding the planet” is crucial to the global agenda — from the Millennium Development Goals to Rio+20 and its Zero Hunger initiative, as well as the G-8 and G-20 processes — and is particularly relevant to the work of the United Nations system. All States Members of the United Nations have been invited, and so far almost 100 countries and international organizations have confirmed their participation. In conclusion, I wish to respond to the appeal you launched in your opening address. Yes, Italy will make an active contribution to the efforts aimed at revitalizing the General Assembly by enhancing digest to promote the implementation of the Palermo Convention by illustrating best practices. The digest is a practical tool for law enforcement officials and prosecutors. It will be officially presented next month in Vienna, on the occasion of the sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.The United Nations is called upon to play a key role in conflict prevention, the settlement of disputes and providing assistance for crisis management and nation-building, in cooperation with regional organizations. Despite the current financial juncture, Italy continues to do its part in crisis management, peacekeeping and stabilization missions. Our expertise and resources — both military and civilian — will remain engaged in a number of critical theatres, especially Afghanistan and Lebanon. That commitment constitutes a heavy burden, but one we deem a worthy investment for the sake of the common interest.In that light, helping Somalia to recover its integrity and dignity will remain high on my Governments agenda.The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have played a crucial role in changing development cooperation policies and practices. But since they were first agreed upon, the development landscape has changed deeply. New challenges have emerged and other issues and processes have come to the fore. The post-2015 development agenda will therefore have to take those trends into account. It will have to include such important dimensions of development as reducing inequality, fostering credible democracy, promoting human rights, good governance, equitable growth, migration, employment, decent jobs and tackling climate change.We are very pleased with your decision, Mr. President, to constitute a high-level panel to discuss this fundamental issue, and to appoint three important leaders to conduct the international debate. We are confident that the process of defining the pillars of the future development agenda will be as inclusive as possible, while avoiding the top-down assumptions that emerged in 1995.In our view, the post-2015 MDGs will have to be harmonized with the inputs that emerged from the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro (Rio+20). The three dimensions of 56 resources through a revolution of rising expectations and during decades of dictatorship, famine and war. It is the story of bringing to justice the perpetrators of the worst international crimes and of preventing the worst human atrocities. Now, extending freedom and harnessing new markets, it is the story of lifting billions more out of poverty and oppression. That has been the work of the United Nations for seven decades.This year we assemble in the knowledge born of those years, neither expecting perfection nor accepting the status quo. We understanding that there is much that we can do together, and more that we can do together than we could ever do alone.The United Nations articulates humankinds highest ideals. Even more, it makes practical progress towards realizing those ideals in the world. There is no better example of that than the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) — specific, measurable targets of the highest human importance that are now familiar to us all. Twelve years after 2000 and three years from 2015, the progress we have made must be just as familiar. The global economy has grown. Hundreds of millions of people have lifted themselves up. That first fundamental Goal, to halve the proportion of the worlds population living in extreme poverty, has now been achieved: 1 billion human lives transformed. A decade ago 100 million children did not get to go to school. That number has been reduced by fully one third, and 33 million human futures have been entirely remade.But we must all acknowledge that there are vital areas where the international community is failing to achieve change. That is why I accepted the Secretary-Generals invitation to co-chair the Millennium Development Goals Advocacy Group alongside Rwanda: to advocate for practical progress in the coming three years. Where the world has fallen short of ambitious goals, our response must be action, not disillusion. That is what Australia will do. We will act. We will help improve education. Australias development spending on education doubled in the past five years. We will be among the worlds largest education donors in 2015. I am especially pleased to join as an education champion in support of the Secretary-Generals Education First initiative to mobilize global support to help achieve education for all children by 2015. I am honoured to lend it Australias support. its role and efficiency. Today more than ever, the world needs the authority of the United Nations. The reform of the Security Council is a key element of this agenda. We are very much counting on members assistance in making it happen. An effective Security Council is crucial not only to meeting the challenges to peace, but also to creating a better international order. An equitable reform of the Council is a matter of continuing legitimacy, rather than of increasing the national power of select Member States. The principles of accountability, consensus and regional empowerment must continue to inspire our commitment."}}
