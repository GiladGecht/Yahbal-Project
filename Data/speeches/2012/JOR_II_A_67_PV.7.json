{"speech":{"0":" It is an honour to join this eminent gathering. Allow me to extend Jordans sincere congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremic. I would like to assure him of Jordans full cooperation. May I also express to the Secretary-General Jordans appreciation for his untiring efforts. I welcome his voice and the voices of world leaders of many religions who stand with billions of Muslims worldwide in rejecting provocations meant to divide those of different faiths.Islam teaches us to honour all human beings, promote tolerance and show mercy. As a Hashemite and a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad — peace and blessings upon him — I condemn all acts that vilify the name of the Prophet or falsely use his name or the name of Islam — or any other religion, for that matter — to justify violence and evil acts such as we have recently Nations through two large-scale projects. The first is the United Nations Regional Centre for Latin America and the Caribbean in Panama, which will host the 16 United Nations subregional offices already established in our country. That Centre will contribute to greater coordination and synergy within the United Nations system, thereby contributing to its operational process, as outlined in the report of the High-level Pannel on United Nations System-wide Coherence, “Delivering as One” (see ). We invite friendly nations who are committed to those reforms to financially contribute to that project, which will soon be open to international bidding. The other project is the regional humanitarian assistance logistics centre for the Americas for the delivery of humanitarian aid in the event of disasters in the region. Panama is committed to being a responsible humanitarian actor in the region, and we place our advantages as an international logistical platform at the disposal of the international community.Panamas economic growth is widely recognized throughout our region. From 2012 to 2013, Panama moved up nine places — from 49 to 40 — in the Global Competitiveness Index, which represents our biggest jump in that ranking since 2005, when our country began to be monitored by the World Economic Forum. Such an increase indicates we are doing things well.Panamas economic growth is the greatest in Latin America. It is based on free market principles, is respectful of the environment, social standards and free enterprise initiatives, and is strongly committed to social inclusion. That has made it possible for us to significantly reduce unemployment in our country to 4.6 per cent and to reduce poverty, including extreme poverty, from 33.4 per cent to 25.8 in just three years, without compromising the riches of our environment. At the same time, our economic growth allows us to allocate resources to confront the threats of climate change, which is affecting and will continue to affect large and small nations without regard for their level of development. We all need to be more responsible in that regard.Panama will continue to advocate for the international community to work on an institutional and multilateral structure that would reinforce the rights of all people to a planet with an environment suitable for the development of a healthful and peaceful life. We will insist on a new high-level discussion forum on the protection of the environment in the context of the General Assembly.20 continue to shoulder that responsibility, international support is essential. We are very grateful for the generous response of Governments, international bodies and dedicated United Nations agencies. The somber reality is, however, that more will be needed, as the camps grow more crowded with vulnerable families and the cold desert winter approaches. I call upon the countries of the United Nations to work together to prevent a humanitarian disaster.While we deal with those challenges, we must never lose our focus on the crisis at the heart of the region. For almost 65 years, the Palestinian people have been the exception to the United Nations promise. We pledge the shelter of international law and human rights, except not yet; the dignity of living in freedom and security, except not yet; the right to self-determination, except not yet. It is time to say, “Enough!”As the Arab Spring demanded dignity for all, so it demanded the end of exceptionalism. No single issue causes greater anger than to tell an entire people that when it comes to global justice they do not count. The Arab Summer cannot bear its full fruit until the Palestinian-Israeli conflict ends, and ends with a just peace and a Palestinian State living side by side with a secure Israel at peace with the entire region.Earlier this year, in Amman, we succeeded in getting both sides back to the table for exploratory talks. Then positive traction stopped again. Illegal settlement-building and unilateral actions have continued, constituting direct threats to a negotiated peace. We are extremely concerned by threats to Jerusalem and the sanctity of its Muslim and Christian holy sites. The Al-Aqsa Mosque compound of Al-Haram Al-Sharif in East Jerusalem is under Hashemite custodianship, a special role recognized by the 1994 Jordan-Israel Treaty of Peace and protected as occupied territory by international law. It is Islams third holiest site and its importance to 1.7 billion Muslims, one quarter of the worlds population, is similar to the importance of the Kaba itself.Let me be absolutely clear, any invasion or division of the site of Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa would be viewed not only as a breach of Israels obligations but as a profound religious transgression. The international community must send a clear message that such a transgression, or any attempt to erase the Arab, Muslim or Christian identity of Jerusalem, will not be tolerated. What is needed now is the full weight of our nations, united. witnessed. There are no sidelines on this issue. All of us of every faith everywhere must be proactive in promoting understanding and a much stronger global dialogue.“To unite our strength” — these four words in the United Nations Charter are not just an old dream, they are a modern urgency. The United Nations and the General Assembly — empowered and strong — are needed today as never before.In my region, we have important tasks ahead. We must provide new and better opportunities for our people, especially our youth, to avert the dangers of regional instability and conflict and to fulfil the universal desire — the basic human right — to live in freedom, dignity, justice and peace. The international community has a crucial interest in supporting countries that are taking risks for peace and reform.In Jordan we have charted our course guided by our heritage, by our mutual respect and by moderation. Our Arab Spring journey is one of opportunity to accelerate home-grown reforms and achieve national goals. Last year I stood before the Assembly and spoke about the reforms that were on the horizon (see ). Since then, new and comprehensive constitutional amendments, as well as new laws, have created a matrix of institutions and principles to support our path of reform and democratization. And with the new year, we will have our new Parliament, and our Jordanian Summer will begin.I would like to address the tragic situation in Syria.Violence must end immediately, and a transition must begin now. There is no alternative to a political solution that will end the bloodshed, restore security and stability and preserve the territorial integrity of Syria and the dignity and unity of its people.The United Nations has an important part to play in helping people commit to a political solution. Jordan will do all in its power to support the newly appointed Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi.The peoples of Jordan and Syria have long and deep ties. Since the current crisis erupted, over 200,000 Syrians have sought refuge in Jordan, putting heavy pressure on our limited resources and our economy. Yet we, as Jordanians, have opened our arms, as we have many times in the past for others in need. As we 21President Ader (spoke in Hungarian; English text provided by the delegation): The rule of law is among the topics before the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly. This is an especially important issue, especially for someone who has had the opportunity to personally experience the lack of it. For many decades, Hungary belonged to the Communist-Socialist bloc. By 1949 the Communist takeover of power had been completed, just four years after the end of the Second World War. The multiparty system had been eliminated. The majority of leaders of political parties established after the war were forced into exile or were imprisoned.I was born 10 years later. I spent my early adult years, and thus the years of my political awakening as well, in a dictatorship. In fact, my two older children were born under that political system. For our generation, just as for that of our parents, our everyday experience was of being deprived of human rights and liberties. Independence? From what, when Soviet troops kept Hungary under occupation? Free elections? How, when political parties were non-existent and, even at late as 1988, it was a crime against the State to form political organizations.Constitutional freedoms, such as the freedom of speech, the right of assembly and the right to practice religion freely, existed only on paper or not even on that. The end of the 1980s and the fall of the Berlin Wall and of the Iron Curtain, brought democratic changes to Hungary as well. It was in the spring of 1990, more than 40 years later, that we could organize free elections again. Preparations for the peaceful transition, and then the post-election years, can be deemed to be a successful period from the perspective of the rule of law.Hungary, however, did not have a new, consolidated Constitution that was not unlike the 1949 Constitution, easily revealed through the number in its title. It was that shortfall that the Hungarian National Assembly rectified in April 2011, when it decided to adopt the new fundamental law of Hungary. What is now the youngest Constitution of Europe incorporates almost all elements of the European Convention on Human Rights, along with the rule-of-law institutions safeguarding the checks and balances established in 1990. As a new element, constitutional constraints compliant with the rule of law have been imposed to curb irresponsible public spending and the reckless increase of State indebtedness.Neither the parties nor the world can afford continued hostility and insecurity. There may be a rare window of opportunity later this year, after the United States elections, to achieve what both sides so urgently need, namely, two States at peace, Palestine and Israel, both secure, both free to look forward on the basis of a just, comprehensive and final settlement. That has always been and will remain a foremost priority for Jordan.Let me say now, as I have said before, that the Arab world seeks peace. We mean by that real peace: diplomatic relations, economic relations, trade and investment. We mean by that a new normality, in peace, where people are safe in their homes, where communities are able to build and where cooperation helps the entire region prosper. All this has been on offer for over 10 years, since 2002, under the Arab Peace Initiative, through which 57 Arab and Muslim countries reached out collectively to Israel. It is time for Israel to turn around, look to the future we must share and make a just and lasting peace with the Palestinians.Almost 70 years ago, countries from every continent chose to come together in hopes of a world united in peace and respectful of all humankind. After a bitter, destructive global war, the United Nations was the right step, the brave step. Today, almost three generations later, we have learned that it is not enough to make the right choices. We must also pursue effective action. Not only as nations but as nations united, we must take the right steps, the brave steps, now."}}
