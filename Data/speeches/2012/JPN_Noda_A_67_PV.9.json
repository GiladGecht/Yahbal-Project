{"speech":{"0":" First, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to His Excellency 44 years, Japan repeatedly procrastinated in policies and was considered a symbol of a country that delayed decisions. I pledged to change all that and staked my political life on implementing a comprehensive reform of our social security and taxation systems.That reform is an ambitious package of policies developed to support Japans social security system by maintaining a stable financial basis in the face of a rapidly aging population and by paving the way for fiscal rehabilitation. It is a comprehensive reform programme that pursues both economic growth and fiscal reconstruction. Japan is taking a firm step towards becoming a country that makes decisions without postponing difficult issues.Another pearl of wisdom that humans acquired came from the possibility of seeing the Earth we live on. I recently had the opportunity to communicate directly with astronaut Akihiko Hoshide from my office while he was orbiting the Earth in the International Space Station. At the time of our phone linkup, a female elementary school student who was in the office with us posed a riddle to the astronaut: “The Earth has air and gravity, but space does not,” she said. “What does space have that the Earth does not?” “The view of the Earth from outside it”, the astronaut replied. That conversation expressed in simple terms what I want to say today.Because we have attained the perspective of being able to see the Earth from outside, humankind as a whole shares the sublime mission of protecting the global environment. We must always return to that perspective, reaching beyond borders and advancing concrete measures to protect the Earths environment, which is the a basis of human survival. With the aim of protecting the global environment, a significant outcome for sustainable development was achieved at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in June 2012. Japan announced its green future initiatives, proposing that we explore sustainable growth in prosperity without the supply-demand crunch of natural resources and energy or damage to the global environment. Japan will implement a low carbon and sound material-cycle society and take the lead in solving the common energy challenges facing the world. To that end, we need more innovation in energy efficiency and renewable energy. In the light of the accident at Tokyo Electric Power Companys Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station on 11 March 2011, and with the goal of achieving a society exponential speed. Human wisdom seems to have improved dramatically. However, is that really true? At the forefront of a long human history, we are living in a period of complicated and violent change. Tensions among nations have risen in many parts of the world, with more uncertain prospects for the future. The real test for our survival in this unprecedented period is not how much knowledge and information we have, but to learn the true value of the numerous pearls of wisdom we have accumulated.One of the first such pearls of wisdom humans gained was the power to give adequate thought to not only the present, but also the future. It is also the power to imagine, beyond our own benefits, the benefits to future generations and the power to act on their behalf. Agricultural society, which prompted human beings to adopt a new vista, was made possible through the long-term perspective towards the future that human beings acquired when they waited for the harvest instead of thinking solely about immediate concerns.Now is the time for us to exert our wisdom and build a sustainable future for the sake of succeeding generations. Many countries have built up massive fiscal deficits, therefore fiscal soundness is now a common challenge. If people living now do not overcome deficits by cutting spending and striving to increase revenues, future generations will be forced to repay the deficits. That structure amounts to nothing but current generations exploiting future generations.Democracy has been historically proven to be the best political system. However, we now face the enormous challenge of learning whether or not democracy can maintain fairness between generations across the globe. Under the system of parliamentary democracy, todays representatives serve people living now; there are no guarantees with respect to properly representing the interests of future generations. The current structure encourages politics that will burden silent future generations by passing todays problems onto them. We are all responsible for the next generations. This generation must successfully meet the challenges before us, and todays political leaders must take responsibility now for tomorrow. In order to protect sound democratic societies, now is the time to exert the power to think about the benefits for future generations. Over the past 20-odd 45weapons of mass destruction and the prevention of terrorism remain key contemporary issues. The nuclear and missile issues in the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea and Iran currently pose serious threats to the entire world. It is essential that all countries coordinate at the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency, including the implementation of Security Council resolutions urging both the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea and Iran to take concrete action. Japan, the only country that has experienced the horror of nuclear devastation in war, will continue to carry out its mission of seeking a world free of nuclear weapons.The issue of the abductions by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea represents a violation of basic human rights. That makes it a universal issue and a matter of grave concern to the entire international community. Japan is committed to continuing its utmost efforts to achieve the return of all victims at the earliest possible date, through strengthened coordination with other Member States. Japan intends to maintain its efforts to comprehensively resolve outstanding issues of concern, settle the unfortunate past and normalize relations in accordance with the Japan-Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea Pyongyang Declaration. Japan continues to urge the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea to take positive steps.Humans have done more than just act on their lust for the use of force. We have also developed the skill to solve conflicts calmly through reason, which we call the rule of law. Every State has a responsibility to safeguard peace, ensure the safety of its people and protect its territorial and maritime sovereignty. Japan will fulfil those responsibilities in accordance with international law. Meanwhile, as globalization proceeds, the challenges confronting the international community are growing increasingly complex, and relations between nations can easily become tense. At this critical juncture, we must establish the rule of law as a basis for global peace, stability and prosperity. Because the rule of law is essential to preventing and resolving conflicts in a peaceful manner, and because it plays a critical role in the maintenance of stable and predictable societies, it must be further enhanced. Any attempt to impose a countrys ideology or claim by unilateral use of force or by threat of the use of force is inconsistent with the fundamental spirit of the United Nations Charter and runs counter to human wisdom; it is thus absolutely unacceptable. It is important to try not dependent on nuclear power by the 2030s, the Government of Japan will mobilize all possible policy resources to show the world a model that supports a good balance between the shift towards green energy and economic growth. We will constantly review and re-examine our policies while carefully assessing the outlook for the future, including the international energy situation. Being ever more conscious of our one precious Earth, we must direct our caring attention to the preciousness of each life breathing on the planet. The Japan-led resolution on human security (resolution ), adopted on 10 September, can be a solid guide to visualizing development for the next generation from the perspective of all people, including women and young people. In the light of the common understanding of human security stipulated in that resolution, Japan is determined to contribute to worldwide efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to work towards the establishment of the next development framework.The ideal of human security needs particular emphasis with respect to the African continent, which steadily reveals greater development potential but still suffers from many challenges, such as poverty, natural disasters and conflicts. On the occasion of the fifth Tokyo International Conference on African Development, to be held in Yokohama next June, Japan plans to discuss the measures the international community and Africa should adopt and implement. We must completely and successfully meet the challenges that place our precious lives in danger. Afghanistan is making significant efforts towards reconstruction after its prolonged experience of war. South Sudan is also moving forward in its nation-building efforts, and Myanmar has taken steady steps towards democracy and reconciliation. Japan will do its utmost to support and promote peacekeeping, peacebuilding and human security in each of those regions.A third pearl of wisdom that humans obtained was the manner in which human beings settle disputes reasonably under rules. Human beings acquired language and nurtured wisdom, but, even in modern times, they have failed to resist the temptation to solve conflicts by force. Despite two world wars and the two calamities of atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, disarmament, the non-proliferation of 46 international judicial institutions play in the peaceful settlement of disputes.Although the Middle East and Africa are still in a tumultuous whirlwind, they are in fact moving in the direction of establishing democracy. Japan will continue to support efforts at democratization and reform of every country. Moreover, we cannot overlook the ongoing violence and suppression in Syria, or the serious violations of human rights with respect to the rule of law. Japan strongly condemns the massive attacks in Syria that have involved tens of thousands of innocent citizens, journalists and aid workers, including Ms. Mika Yamamoto, a Japanese journalist. Japan intends to put more pressure on the Government of Syria, together with the international community, and to extend humanitarian assistance to the people of Syria.Let me emphasize that the international community must secure the protection of civilians and the safety of diplomats and workers of international organizations through the rule of law. Today, violence against that principle cannot be tolerated for any reason.The concept of the rule of law is the foundation for a stable and reliable society, making the movement of peoples and goods more vibrant and serving as a basis of prosperity. I believe that the rule of law can provide important infrastructure for order and prosperity for a network of States centred in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan will vigorously contribute to rule-making efforts to expand trade and investment, build maritime order, including the safety of navigation, and create stability for prosperity.The rules needed by the international community are not simply for solving individual problems. Orderly relations between nations or within international organizations require the rule of law, more specifically, enhanced global governance. Unless all nations fulfil their responsibilities in their respective capacities, we cannot overcome the various common challenges that the world is facing. I hope in particular that emerging countries will fulfil their responsibilities commensurate with their respective national powers.As part of such efforts, it is important that we engage in thorough discussions on how the United Nations should develop in the future. We strongly support management reform at the United Nations. Furthermore, in order for the Security Council to be fully effective, it must be endowed with a legitimacy to further develop international law and ensure that it gets implemented more effectively. I strongly call for leaders to strengthen the rule of law so as to leave future generations with a more peaceful and stable international community.We are currently witnessing the settlement of conflicts between nations on the basis of international law. A typical example is the dispute settlement process of the World Trade Organization, a mechanism that has made it possible for States to solve trade disputes with the common language of law, not by force, in a panel or appellate body.Japan has always valued the rule of law and has contributed to strengthening it. Since joining the International Court of Justice, Japan has consistently recognized the jurisdiction of the Court as compulsory and has taken the lead in practicing the rule of law. Japan is leading the world in its contributions of personnel and financing to international judicial institutions. In addition to having served at the International Court of Justice, Japanese judges have also served at the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia. Furthermore, Japan has provided the largest financial support of any country for the latter three institutions. Japan requests each country to kindly offer financial support to the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, which is facing a severe financial crisis at the moment.Supporting the United Nations in promoting the rule of law continues to be a great challenge. Once again, I call for nations to work in cooperation with the United Nations to recognize the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, as Japan did, and for non-member countries of the ICC and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to join at an early date.There are still a number of territorial and maritime disputes in many parts of the world. It is the philosophy of the Charter of the United Nations and a principle shared by the international community as a whole that disputes should be settled in a peaceful manner on the basis of international law. In all circumstances, Japan is determined to comply with that principle and seek peaceful solutions based on international law. The world should pay greater attention to the role the 47am thinking especially of the positive developments in Myanmar and Somalia and of the young democracies throughout the world, such as Timor-Leste. But it is, of course, the transformations under way in the Arab world that are foremost in my mind today.(spoke in English)When these historic changes swept through the Arab world, they stirred a mixture of deep emotions in those watching, both within the region and beyond. There was fear of bloodshed, regional instability and of a rise of extremism, and uncertainty about what was yet to come. But, overwhelmingly, the world looked on with solidarity, understanding and hope. We in Europe — geographically so close and with our societies so deeply involved with those in the countries experiencing these upheavals — were also acutely aware that the changes and the risks and opportunities that lay ahead would directly affect us as neighbours.Of course, expectations were high. It was tempting to read the events in Tunis or Cairo as the opening pages of a fairy tale. But this is the book of history. It contains dark pages too, some of them tragically being written at this very moment. We are bound by a simple truth: achieving lasting change takes time. New democratic institutions do not run smoothly as if by magic. Turning economies around and creating jobs for millions of young men and women are not things that happen at the wave of a wand. Deep tensions do not suddenly dissolve once a dictator has gone.The long path of transition lies ahead. There will undoubtedly be disappointments along the way. There will be wrong turns, hurdles and setbacks. But I firmly believe that despite the difficulties, the momentum is heading in the right direction and there is no going back. Whatever the future brings, the Arab Spring will remain a turning point. The movement is irreversible. Once the voices of the people have been set free — an unforgettable experience for all those who had never been heard before — those voices cannot be silenced.It is the responsibility of each country to chart its own course and to do justice to the aspirations of its people. The European Union is committed to staying by their side every step along the way. We are in it for the long run. I want to reaffirm that we still believe in the message of the Arab Spring.Europeans are well placed to recognize that political change is not painless and does not happen that reflects the realities of the world today. Japan is ready to take on greater responsibility in the international community. Now is the time to accelerate the stalled process on Security Council reform and to start genuine negotiations.So far I have mentioned three pearls of wisdom necessary for human beings to live sustainable lives in the future, and I have tried to convey Japans contribution in each. It is my belief that human beings will continue to adapt to a complex world and become wiser. I believe they will give adequate consideration to future generations and solve disputes calmly through reason based on rules generated from the perspective of looking at the Earth from the outside.Let us take charge of our responsibilities for tomorrow together. The lofty task for us living now is to carry out politics while imagining the benefits for future generations and gather all our wisdom to set a course towards the survival of human beings.I should like to conclude my remarks by pledging to the entire General Assembly that Japan will stand at the forefront of shaping the future of human history for peaceful and aff luent societies."}}
