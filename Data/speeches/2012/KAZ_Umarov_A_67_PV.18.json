{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of the Republic of Kazakhstan, I would like to congratulate you, Mr. Jeremic, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, as well as to wish you every success. I also wish to express our appreciation to Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, for his skillful steering of the Assemblys proceedings.In recent years, the world has lived through major political, social, economic and environmental upheavals. The geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East, as well as natural and man-made disasters, serve as compelling evidence indicating that the issues of security, stability and sustainable development are becoming increasingly relevant.We believe that world politics should be based on new global principles. In the twenty-first century, those principles encompass constructive multipolarity and transparency, trust and political tolerance, and the clear pre-eminence of evolutionary forms of development of the world. They should be enshrined in the core documents of the United Nations and in the entire international law system. In that context, we believe that it is fundamentally important to ensure strict adherence to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of Member States.The threat of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology, along with the spectre of their acquisition and use by terrorist entities, has been one of the most daunting challenges to humankind. It is our strongly held view that the possession of weapons of mass destruction is not a guarantee of security or greater independence. Kazakhstans own record shows that countries reap huge benefits from the renunciation of nuclear weapons. By voluntarily giving up the worlds fourth-largest nuclear arsenal and shutting down the largest test site in Semipalatinsk, on 29 August 1991, we have won more friends and have become a more prosperous, stable and influential country.Kazakhstan fully supports the proposal by the Secretary-General to adopt a nuclear weapons convention. Sharing its declared goals, His Excellency Mr. Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, suggested that, as an important step in that direction, the United Nations should adopt a universal declaration of a nuclear-weapon-free world. That would, undoubtedly, facilitate our advancement towards a nuclear-weapon-free world and an early adoption of a nuclear weapons convention. Kazakhstan welcomes the establishment of a constructive dialogue with the five nuclear Powers with a view towards signing a protocol on negative security assurances to the State 6 parties to the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia.We also call for an early establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. In that regard, we look forward to the upcoming conference in Helsinki and its positive outcomes.Kazakhstan is working on the practical implementation of a project to host an international bank of low-enriched uranium, under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which would allow, if need be, to ensure an uninterrupted supply of nuclear fuel. It should be made clear that the bank will in no way infringe upon the inalienable right of each State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, including the development of nuclear technology.This year, we will complete the project to enhance physical security of the former Semipalatinsk test site. We view this project, which is being implemented jointly with the United States and Russia, as our significant contribution to the global non-proliferation regime.Kazakhstan is actively involved in the fight against international terrorism and drug trafficking, within the framework of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia (CICA). As Chair of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, Kazakhstan consistently works to strengthen regional cooperation in this area. Special attention has been paid to the expansion of practical cooperation between the United Nations and regional arrangements, including, in particular, the Kazakhstan-based Central Asian Regional Information and Coordination Centre for the fight against the threat of drug trafficking, which is designed to enhance multilateral cooperation to counter the f low of drugs from Afghanistan.Given the increasing attention by the international community to the issue of international information security, we believe that the time has come to consider the introduction of new concepts into international law, such as electronic borders and electronic sovereignty, as well as the establishment of a cyberpolice unit.As the current Chair of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Kazakhstan will continue to fully support the process that aims to bring stability and peace back to the region of the Middle East and North Africa.Before I turn to regional issues, let me express our strong condemnation of the Internet video and cartoons that provocatively offend the religious feelings of Muslims. Such disgusting incitements must be stopped, because they lead to an escalation of violence by fomenting hatred between the representatives of religions, and they undermine inter-civilizational dialogue and confidence-building. The right to freedom of expression must be exercised with due responsibility.We were shocked by the tragic killing of United States diplomats in Benghazi. We condemn attacks on diplomats and diplomatic missions and call upon Governments to adhere to their international obligations to protect diplomatic representatives in their countries.We should support all efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Syria and assist in preventing a humanitarian disaster. We should also take measures to prevent any spillover of the crisis to the rest of the region. To that end, both the Syrian Government and the opposition should resort to diplomacy, not arms, and put an immediate end to the violence.The principles of sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs must be respected. It is the Syrians themselves who should determine the future of their country. We call on all nations to unite around the Syrian transition process, which should be based on dialogue and compromise, and support the activities of the Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi.Kazakhstan calls for the creation of conditions to settle the Palestinian issue, including through the continuation of direct Palestinian-Israeli talks. All obstacles to the negotiation process should be removed. Kazakhstan has been and continues to be a supporter of the legitimate rights of Palestine to establish a sovereign and independent State, within the 1967 borders, and its entry into the United Nations as a full member.We have consistently advocated a peaceful, exclusively diplomatic, resolution of the situation around the Iranian nuclear programme and look forward to the continuation of constructive dialogue between Iran and all interested parties with a view to developing mutually acceptable solutions.The reconstruction of Afghanistan is an important objective of the international community that meets the aspirations of the Afghans themselves. We believe that, 7if our cooperation on Afghanistan is to be successful, its economic dimension should be a priority. Efforts to stabilize the situation should be bolstered by reforms aimed at sustainable development and the improvement of socioeconomic indicators in the country, its level of education and other human standards.Kazakhstan is also actively involved in multilateral cooperation to assist Afghanistan, as demonstrated by its readiness to host, in 2013 in Astana, the next conference of the Istanbul process.Almaty, the southern megalopolis of Kazakhstan, has the necessary facilities to accommodate the offices of international organizations. Sixteen organizations of the United Nations family have already set up their offices in the city. Most of them enjoy a regional status. We promote further expansion of the presence of United Nations organizations, including its humanitarian agencies, and offer to establish a United Nations centre in Almaty, in order to effectively coordinate international efforts and implement regional projects of the United Nations, including those dealing with assistance to Afghanistan.This year, we mark the twentieth anniversary of the initiative to convene the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia, announced by President Nursultan Nazarbayev at the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly, on 5 October 1992 (see ). The anniversary session and the fourth meeting of CICA Foreign Ministers, held in Astana on 12 September, have become important milestones in the evolution of that Asian forum. Currently, the Conference brings together 24 countries that occupy over 90 per cent of the territory of Asia, where half of the worlds population now resides. As a platform for dialogue, CICA has an important role to play in efforts to ensure peace, security and stability in Asia.Kazakhstan urges that close attention be paid to the expansion of the trade, investment and transit transport capacity of least developed countries, landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and small island developing States. To advance the interests of these groups of countries, Kazakhstan, together with the United Nations, organized, from 12 to 14 September in Almaty, the fourth meeting of LLDC Trade Ministers and the high-level global thematic meeting on international trade, trade facilitation and aid for trade.Today, the whole world is facing new challenges to global energy security. Central Asia has great potential to become a global energy centre. The development of energy resources is a priority for the Republic of Kazakhstan. In our vision, the future of the region lies in the development of the oil and gas pipeline system to deliver our hydrocarbon resources to Europe and Asia.As a follow-up to the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development and to draw the attention of the international public to the issues of renewable sources of energy, Kazakhstan has decided to seek the nomination of its capital, Astana, as the host of the international exhibition Expo 2017 on the subject of “Energy for the Future”. We count on fellow Member States to support our bid. As one of the pilot countries selected from among States Members of the United Nations, Kazakhstan will actively promote the development of draft sustainable development goals for the period beyond 2015.Kazakhstan is not only in a position to ensure its own food security; it is also willing to contribute to global food security.Intercultural dialogue is an important prerequisite for peace and security. To promote such dialogue, Kazakhstan put forward an initiative to proclaim an International Decade for the Rapprochement of Cultures 2013-2022, which was adopted at the conclusion of the thirty-sixth session of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization General Conference, in November 2011.Kazakhstan attaches special importance to the protection of human rights and has announced its bid for membership in the Human Rights Council for the period 2012-2015. If elected, Kazakhstan will participate, with a full sense of responsibility, in the proceedings of that important human rights body, on the basis of an open, impartial, non-politicized and mutually respectful dialogue between the Member States of the United Nations.Last March, the Republic of Kazakhstan celebrated the twentieth anniversary of its membership in the United Nations. All these years, we have consistently stood for an inclusive, transparent and effective Organization. We strongly believe that it is only by uniting our efforts that we can make real progress in addressing the global issues and challenges facing humanity. We therefore call for joint efforts to seek solutions to common problems for the benefit of future generations and our common planet Earth. 8 As we all struggle to overcome the effects of the global financial crisis, we should not lose sight of new emerging challenges and threats, such as obstacles to sustainable development, the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), climate change, food security and so on. Many developing countries still face many obstacles to achieving all their MDGs by the target date of 2015, owing to their vulnerability to the global financial crisis, the challenges of the debt burden and the unmet commitments of official development assistance. Having achieved stable growth successively for a number of years, Cambodia is confident that, despite its limited resources, it will achieve the Cambodian MDGs by 2015. We welcome the adoption of resolution , entitled “The future we want”, by the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), held in Rio de Janeiro on June 2012, and strongly advocate that the MDGs should remain a fundamental milestone in the development agenda. We also call for renewed efforts to enable the developing countries to achieve their Millennium Development Goals on time.Climate change is a critical problem for the whole world, requiring immediate and concerted actions. The rapid pace of climate change could have devastating effects, particularly on small States in the Asia-Pacific and the Caribbean regions, in the form of rising sea levels. Other developing countries, mostly dependent on agriculture, are threatened by similar negative effects, such as extreme floods and drought, which affect their livelihood. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon described such phenomena as a real threat to international peace and security.Regrettably, despite all the adversities inflicted on the worlds most vulnerable people by climate change, the international community remains divided on implementing a rapid and critical global response. We call on developed countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in accordance with the United Nations principle of common but differentiated responsibility. It is disappointing that, for the most part, the promises made by developed nations in Copenhagen in 2009, in Cancun in 2010 and in Durban in 2011 have not been fulfilled in a timely manner.In the same vein, we are of the view that natural-disaster management and cooperation mechanisms should be further developed and strengthened at both the regional and the global levels, with a view to preventing natural disasters "}}
