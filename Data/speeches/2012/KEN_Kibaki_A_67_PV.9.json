{"speech":{"0":" It is an honour and a pleasure for me to once again address the General Assembly.Kenya is at a time in its history that is full of hope for a bright future. Over the past 10 years, our country has enjoyed a sustained blossoming of democracy. In the year 2010, Kenya adopted a new Constitution. With that constitution, we further secured the human rights and civil liberties of our citizens and entrenched constitutional governance and justice.Equally important, over the past 10 years, we have scored significant victories against diseases including HIV and AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other childhood and adult maladies. Hundreds of thousands more children have found their way into school and many more adults have found new life skills through training and capacity-building. We have also pulled hundreds of thousands of Kenyans out of poverty and put them on the pathway to economic independence and self-reliance. In doing so, we have also expanded our economic base, opening up new and extensive infrastructure, energy and information technology projects. 25the peace and security of Israel are both assured and guaranteed. In that regard, it is our hope that Palestine will soon be welcomed into the community of nations with full membership in the United Nations.There can be no lasting peace without sustainable and inclusive development. Kenya therefore greatly appreciates the achievements of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development held earlier this year in Brazil. Kenya is encouraged that, in line with recommendations proposed during the Conference, the General Assembly has placed high on its agenda for this session some of the decisions we took in Rio de Janeiro. That is indeed an indication of our collective political will to ensure that the decisions contained in the outcome document are implemented. Key among those is the decision to strengthen the institutional framework for sustainable development, including the upgrading of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Kenya appreciates that historic decision to strengthen and upgrade UNEP, which will enable it to fulfil its mandate effectively. Kenya reiterates its commitment to continue to host and facilitate the work of a revamped UNEP, and we look forward to its eventual transformation into a full-f ledged organization for the global environment.Finally, we are all aware that many of our modern disputes and conflicts revolve around concerns about water, available land and agriculture, forests, rivers and lakes. Dealing with our environment and the effects of climate change is therefore an important part of resolving disputes and conflicts around the world. Strengthening global institutions that deal with the environment, biodiversity and climate change must therefore be a core part of our strategy to avoid conflict and disputes among the peoples of the world.It is important that, as the community of nations, we invest in the peaceful settlement of international disputes. However, we must invest first in the prevention of disputes and, secondly, in addressing the root causes of conflicts, such as poverty, inequality, disregard for international law and disrespect for each others sociocultural and religious beliefs, among others. Only by addressing the root causes of conflict and disputes can we hope to find lasting peace in a just and equitable world."}}
