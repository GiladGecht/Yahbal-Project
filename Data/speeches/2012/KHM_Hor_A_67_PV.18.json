{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of my delegation, please allow me to extend our sincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I have no doubt that under your able leadership this session will yield fruitful outcomes. I would also like to convey my admiration to Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his untiring efforts to overcome the many multifaceted challenges confronting our world today.Let me start with the obvious. The twenty-first century we live in is facing one of its most difficult moments. Never before has the pressure of global interdependency been so intense. As economies become more and more interdependent, not only are opportunities to create wealth multiplied, but so are opportunities to transmit destabilizing shocks from one country to another. Imbalances and risks are omnipresent. In the context of declining economic prospects and mounting global challenges, collective actions are required to remedy the shortcomings of global governance in ensuring systemic financial stability, a stable monetary system and the regulation of international financial markets, and in dealing with major systemic shocks. The multilateral system, devised more than half a century ago, is facing challenges to its capacity to deliver on its mandate as the international agenda has become increasingly complex. Clearly, the current multilateral system needs to be radically reformed and made into a well-coordinated and permeable body of institutions that can deliver innovative and feasible solutions to a globalized international society.In order to respond to systemic risk in the financial sector, we have closely cooperated with China, Japan and the Republic of Korea within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to strengthen a regional financial safeguard mechanism, called the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization, which has recently increased its funding level from $120 billion to $240 billion. We strongly believe that that regional financial arrangement will complement the global firewall for regional crisis resolution. ASEAN has also established a macroeconomic and finance surveillance office in Singapore to achieve a more integrated, even-handed and effective surveillance mechanism. 9reform for growth and employment; the urgency to improve and strengthen the international financial architecture in an interconnected global economy; the imperative of completing the Doha Round and the prevention of the return of trade protectionism; and the priority of further facilitating trade, an important conducive factor for stimulate international economic growth, which all our countries need.Cambodia fully supports all the priorities agreed among the G-20 countries in Los Cabos to promote trade, job creation and economic growth, including their determination to finalize negotiations on the Doha Round agenda as soon as possible. International trade is one of the most important factors that will bring about economic growth and job creation in both the immediate and longer term.Since the establishment of the United Nations, in 1945, the global situation has changed so dramatically that global diplomac urgently needs to be strengthened. It is therefore in everyones interest to push for comprehensive reform of the United Nations so that it ref lects the diverse needs and representativeness of the world today. That reform should be comprehensive and should cover not only the Security Council but also other United Nations organs in order to preserve its relevance and legitimacy as an effective global governance institution to cope with the reality of the present-day world, which is different from that of the post-Second World War era. Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria), Vice-President, took the Chair. The General Assembly should be further empowered to enable it to play a leading role in addressing todays global problems as a democratic, deliberative policymaking organ of the United Nations. Both the permanent and non-permanent membership of the Security Council should be equitably expanded so that it represents both developed and the developing countries.In the spirit of the United Nations peacekeeping mission for the advancement of world peace, security and development, Cambodia has contributed 1,000 men to United Nations peacekeeping operations in Africa, especially in South Sudan and Lebanon. Through its experience of close collaboration with the United Nations and its own experience in ending war, and thanks to its win-win policy and post-conflict management, in particular with respect to economic and addressing related issues that have become more pressing owing to climate change. ASEAN has made great progress in that area at the regional level; the establishment of the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management, known as the AHA Centre, deserves mention in that regard.Food security is another serious issue of the present time. At the speed the worlds population is growing, the United Nations Environment Programme predicts that by 2030 we will need to produce 50 per cent more food, 30 per cent more clean water and 40 per cent more energy. Consequently, the increased competition for natural resources and between biofuel energy and food for human needs will only further exacerbate the food security situation. A major global reform is needed urgently to implement the Rio+20 recommendations on sustainable development, which emphasize both the need for major investments to modernize agriculture and encourage small-scale agricultural projects around the world and the vital importance of addressing interlinkages between energy and agricultural prices.Rising oil and food prices are a common concern of the majority of countries in the world. High oil prices contribute to soaring food prices. Rising oil and food prices mean increased poverty levels at a time when global growth is still weak and the number of the unemployed and underemployed is continuously rising in many countries. Our modern global food system is highly oil-dependent, but petroleum is becoming less and less affordable. Thus, there is no solution yet for the worlds worsening food crisis within the current energy and agricultural system. What is needed is a major rethinking of both food and energy prices and the coordination of agricultural and energy policies. We can but appeal to the world oil-producing countries to consider the negative effects of higher fuel prices and their impact on food and energy security.In our regional context, ASEAN has adopted a comprehensive strategy on food security with the signing of the Emergency Rice Reserve Agreement with China, Japan and the Republic of Korea, which is a permanent scheme for meeting emergency requirements.The Group of 20 (G-20) has a crucial role to play in meeting those global challenges. Cambodia, as Chair of ASEAN, appreciated the opportunity to represent ASEAN at the G-20 Summit held in Los Cabos in June. Cambodias views reflected the need to, among other things, to sustain economic stability and structural 10 and social development and national reconciliation, Cambodia wishes to contribute more effectively, through the Security Council, to the cause of peace, security and the peaceful settlement of conflicts in many parts of the world. To that end, for the very first time since joining the United Nations, in 1955, Cambodia has presented its candidature as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the period 2013-2014, for which voting will be held next month. I also wish to note that, since 1955, Cambodia has never occupied any seat in the United Nations system and that its candidature has been endorsed and supported by all ASEAN member States.Before I conclude, I would like to take this opportunity to stress that Cambodia deeply regrets the acts of violence against the United States Consulate in Benghazi, which caused the death of four American diplomats, including the United States Ambassador, even though we very well understand the legitimate anger at disrespect towards the Muslim religion."}}
