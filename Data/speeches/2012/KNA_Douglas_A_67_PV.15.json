{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of the Government and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis, I extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. Vuk Jeremic on his election to the presidency of General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. His task, we know, will be far from easy in the light of the wide range of taxing issues that will be brought before him. As he embarks on his tenure, it is our hope that under his astute leadership, the myriad issues that define the work of the Assembly will continue to find relevance for all of us.It is imperative, therefore, that the mobilization of commitments required to advance the agenda of this sixty-seventh session begin now. We are aware that the challenges associated with that task are demanding and will indeed require our focused attention, strong 21participate effectively in the multilateral institutions to voice our positions on the issue of NCDs. That is why the Caribbean Community has taken the lead on this matter in recent years, with the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases. Therefore, in the light of the clear nexus between a healthy workforce and a nations economic potential, I urge this body today to move forward to launch a United Nations campaign to curb the global toll of NCDs as we move towards the realization of our Millennium Development Goals. At the time of last years High-level Meeting on NCDs, there was a commitment both to ensuring that this grave issue remains high on the development agenda and to ensuring concrete action in that regard. Hence, the type of global effort previously recommended would constitute precisely the type of concrete action to which we committed ourselves one year ago.Any discussion of global health must address the issue of HIAIDS, and because our ultimate objective must be the complete eradication of that dreaded disease — as opposed to the lifelong management and accommodation of same by millions of people around the globe — I appeal today for a wise, determined and discerning onslaught against the scourge at the local, national, and international levels by us all. Here and now, we must recommit ourselves to eradicating the stigmatization of and discrimination against people living or associated with HIAIDS. The abuses of human lives that perpetuate discrimination and stigmatization must come to an end. We in the Caribbean are committed to achieving exactly that.I wish now to address a matter that is profoundly troubling to small island States like mine. Whatever the debate being waged internationally regarding the question of climate change, and however dramatic the rhetorical jousting within various circles on the issue, we in the Caribbean can attest to the radical climatic shifts that our region has undergone in recent decades. Moreover, it is very troubling that the largest contributors of greenhouse gases are still not taking responsibility for the increasing temperatures, rising sea levels, coastal degradation, coral reef bleaching and decimation, infrastructural damage and loss of lives that their actions have wrought. Our peoples, our maritime integrity, our soils and our infrastructure are all interrelated contributors to our addresses the issue of the reform that is required to ensure that our youth embrace renewed alternatives to lives of unproductivity and look towards a new hope for peace and prosperity through respect for human life. That is of great importance to us. The continuing f low of foreign-made small arms into our Caribbean region, however, concerns us greatly. Originating beyond our shores, those weapons have dire consequences in terms both of human life and of the economic stability of our nations.We are aware that changing cultural values are influencing the use of weapons by some in our nations, and we understand the importance of focused and effective policing and partnership on matters of security. In that regard, we urge the international community to make the production of a much-needed and long-overdue arms trade treaty an absolute priority. The interests of democratic nations everywhere cry out for the establishment of international standards and controls governing the illicit f low of conventional weapons, and I urge the establishment of a dedicated secretariat to assist States parties in that regard.I ask: How can small Caribbean nations be expected to deal single-handed with the double misfortune of being located between regions of massive drug production and regions of massive drug consumption? Small arms and light weapons always follow illegal drugs, and we in the Caribbean are simply not equipped to deal with the externally created crime fallout. On that point, I wish to stress that before its closure, the Barbados branch of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime provided critical, hands-on collaboration in this high-priority area of fighting crime. With its presence now having been withdrawn, the vital support that we need simply is not there, leaving us to adjust as best we can at precisely the time when drug- and deportee-related crimes continue to be a major hemispheric challenge.While we focus on the well-being of our people, my Government has strengthened its primary health care with increased attention to reducing the prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and has updated an implementable plan of action that addresses the priorities in keeping with the Political Declaration on NCDs (resolution , annex). As part of our national sensitization mechanism on health-related issues, we are institutionalizing a culture of wellness with emphasis on healthy lifestyles. Similar responses have been initiated at the regional level, as we encourage Member States to 22 developing States, by virtue of our size and geographic profile, are clearly among the worlds most vulnerable nations — hence the recognition of our need for special attention where sustainable development is concerned and the importance of everyone remembering the absolutely essential nature of special and differentiated responsibilities where small island States are concerned. I therefore urge that clear targets be established now so that we can all prepare thoroughly and well for the 2014 Conference, at which urgently needed attention will be paid to the ways in which our own vulnerabilities as small developing States might best be reduced. This body can be assured of our full participation in the process and in the post-Rio+20 sustainable development agenda. Permit me to point out, however, the extent to which the best-laid plans of countries like mine are repeatedly upended by decisions made in nations far beyond our shores. I mentioned earlier the impact of externally generated carbon emissions on our economic prospects. I also discussed the severe national security threat posed to our region by foreign-made small arms and weapons that have been finding their way into our nations. Particularly trying as well, and very troublingly and destabilizing for many countries throughout the region — and indeed the world at large — has been the global economic crisis that made itself manifest in 2008, the ramifications of which have been trying and testing regional economic planners to the limits ever since. In no way of our making, that global economic crisis has severely complicated the task of governance in advanced economies and more so in highly indebted middle-income nations like mine. It has introduced both new variables and additional unknowns to our economic planning models, and has, in a nutshell, thrust upon us a backdrop of global volatility that none of us could have anticipated, that none of us welcome, and that has created immense difficulties for all of our people.Indeed, Saint Kitts and Nevis was forced to pursue a new economic development programme involving fiscal balance and debt restructuring, with built-in social safety nets. The assistance of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Union and our many local, regional and international creditors, including the United Kingdom and the United States, as members of the Paris Club, have helped us to alleviate the severity of the social impact of the economic adjustment and to restore confidence among our investors in the overall social and economic viability. And the absence of corrective and restitutional action on the part of the industrialized nations involved is neither constructive nor understandable in this highly interdependent world. The physical, mental and financial burdens that other countries energy usage has inflicted on countries like mine has been enormous, plunging us deeper into debt and severely frustrating our efforts to meet our Millennium Development Goals. While a shift to renewable energy will not instantly solve the myriad problems caused by a significantly fossil fuel-based global economy, the embrace of green energy will indeed help to halt the intense downward spiral into which our fossil fuel-based economies have thrust our planet. And so we strongly urge that green energy be made an absolute priority globally. I must commend the Secretary-General for his visionary leadership and the Governments and financial institutions that have committed generously to ensuring that high-impact clean energy is utilized globally. My Government wishes to place on record its appreciation to the Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan and other development partners for their valuable assistance to my country in the area of renewable energy, which will positively impact our energy cost-reduction efforts as we move towards realizing a full green economy by 2015 in order to bring much-needed financial relief to our people.The recently held United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) set the stage for a reconfiguration of the global programme on sustainable development, and signaled a new era in the sustainable development agenda of the international community. Two decades of debate and deliberation were instrumental in our being able to frame the dialogue, and envision a path for the two decades ahead of us. If we are to even approach the potential of Rio+20, it will be essential that we first face up to, and then break, the strictures of indifference and narrow self-interest that have plagued us for far too long. It is therefore incumbent upon us and future generations to view our responsibilities as parts of an ongoing continuum, with each of our efforts benefitting from and building upon the work that came before.Saint Kitts and Nevis therefore applauds the decision to convene the third United Nations Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States in 2014. Small island 23nation, always been our guiding force. My delegation calls on all States members of this great body to similarly respect that most sacred pillar of international coexistence.Throughout the 29 years of our existence as a sovereign nation, the Republic of China on Taiwan has been a highly valued partner and ally. Throughout my nation, evidence of our collaborative efforts abound in areas as diverse as agriculture, agritourism, green energy, information technology, community development and education, to name just a few. In my own nation or even my region, however, Taiwans unfailing and valued contributions to the work of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the World Health Assembly and other forums have long demonstrated its outstanding credentials as a valued and impactful member of the global community. It is only fitting and just that all remaining strictures pertaining to Taiwans standing among the international community of nations be removed. Saint Kitts and Nevis appeals to this body to ensure that that will indeed be done.In closing, I wish to stress here how unfortunate it is that, yet again, the case has to be made for the lifting of the embargo on Cuba. The embargo is not, as some may wish to suggest, a matter of merely bilateral import. Not only have we repeatedly heard Cuba oppose the situation in this very body, but we also know that the embargos continued denial of certain medical treatments to the Cuban people is simply unconscionable. Cuba and its people have made considerable contributions to international medicine and higher education, and the Caribbean has been among its most sustained beneficiaries. It is therefore with the utmost conviction and clearest possible resolve that Saint Kitts and Nevis calls for the immediate end to the embargo.I recall that it was in July and August of this year that the international community participated in the games of the thirtieth Olympiad. At a time of rising international tensions and intensifying antagonisms, the time has probably come for us to introduce to other areas of international and intra-State realms of interaction the keen spirit of cooperation and mutual respect that has enabled the Olympics to function so constructively and so well for so many years.economy of Saint Kitts and Nevis. But we continue to face significant challenges, especially in relation to the attainment of economic growth in the context of a very sluggish and uncertain global economy. The mammoth challenges and difficulties that our small multi-island State faces underscore the need to pay greater attention to the issue of special and differentiated responsibilities in a rather trying era. It also underscores the need for small, responsible nations like mine to have fair and calm paths to redress in our relations with far larger and infinitely more powerful friends and allies.A few days ago in this very Assembly, the nations of the world held the High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law at the National and International Levels. While there is often debate as to the exact meaning of the rule of law, my delegation and the people we represent are happy to align ourselves with the core principle on the rule of law, as distilled by the late Mr. Thomas Bingham, Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales. In his book The Rule of Law, he stated:“The core of the existing principle is, I suggest, that all persons and authorities within the state, whether public or private, should be bound by and entitled to the benefit of laws publicly made, taking effect (generally) in the future and publicly administered in the courts.”Although not comprehensive, in my countrys view that represents a solid basis from which to identify the essential elements of a continually evolving concept and an essential mechanism for conflict resolution and for ensuring respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms of our people. I support the call of the Secretary-General for a comprehensive approach to strengthening the rule of law at the international and domestic levels.I make the point because, over our almost 30 years of nationhood, Saint Kitts and Nevis has studiously examined both trends here at the United Nations and developments throughout the international community as we have evaluated our place in the world. Throughout that time, we have been faithfully guided by our belief in the rule of law. We believe that in the international arena, the rule of law was created to protect the vulnerable, like ours, and to remind us of obligations to our fellow human beings. We further believe that orderly and constructive coexistence requires not only citizens, but nations as well to be bound by the rule of law. Respect for international law has therefore, for our 24 generations. The theme of the sixty-seventh session, “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means”, should therefore lead us to focus on finding lasting solutions to the numerous ongoing conflicts in various parts of the world that are causing vulnerable people to suffer. Members have the solemn responsibility to steer this multilateral gathering towards deeper consideration of the founding goals of the Organization, which are to encourage and create a more secure and peaceful world in which diverse cultures and civilizations can coexist without having to resort to force and violence to achieve their goals.This rostrum can testify to all the speeches that have been delivered by the worlds great leaders on a vast array of issues that affect humankind. Many of us representing politically independent nations here have shared the journey and the litany of heartaches and dreams deferred of many of our global citizens, whose human rights to larger political and civil freedom are still bound by the tentacles of imperialism and the legacy of colonialism. Even now, for the remaining colonized territories, this rostrum represents the pinnacle they so greatly aspire to reach one day. Since 1980, the Republic of Vanuatu has repeatedly called for the United Nations to strengthen its efforts towards achieving the full decolonization of territories still controlled by administrative Powers. I call on the independent, free nations of the world to complete the story of decolonization and to close that chapter. At this juncture, I urge the United Nations not to reject the demands for French Polynesias right to self-determination and progress. In the same manner, negotiations for the self-government of the indigenous people of New Caledonia must continue. We encourage the parties to ensure that the process towards achieving self-government will stay on track. I also call upon Members to ensure that collective action is taken to lift the embargo on Cuba. We, the Members of the United Nations, must revive our political motivation and courage, dispel our feelings of animosity, and ensure that United Nations resolutions on that issue are fully implemented. Our actions must not detract from the universal values of love and respect for people, no matter how insignificant they may be to the powerful nations. I hope that one day we will at last be able to echo the message of freedom to many of our friends who still suffer from the burden of conflicting ideologies.The international community is, by definition, diverse. Throughout the community, however, there run strong seams of commonality that can and must be better utilized in order to promote peace, the constructive airing of differences and the avoidance of violent conflict. Most importantly, when all else fails, we can and must settle the most vexing international crises through the good offices of this institution, our United Nations. That is the path that would serve all our best interests. I sincerely urge that we take it."}}
