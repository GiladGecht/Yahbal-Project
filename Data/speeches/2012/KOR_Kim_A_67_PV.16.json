{"speech":{"0":" Allow me at the outset to express my sincere congratulations to Mr. Vuk Jeremic on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I have every confidence that under his able leadership this session will be crowned with great success.Humankind continues to advance, drawing on our collective wisdom to address challenges throughout human history. Although new global challenges to mankind such as climate change, poverty and disease, underdevelopment, terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are now testing the international community, I have no doubt that we will overcome those challenges on our future path.The United Nations, the symbol of our collective wisdom, should take greater responsibility in coping with the challenges. I note with great satisfaction that the United Nations is becoming a more accountable and trusted international Organization under the prominent leadership of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. In that regard, I recognize and support the Secretary-Generals five-year Action Agenda, which I believe will guide us in addressing current world challenges and onward towards the future we are aiming for.The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), held in June in Rio de Janeiro, represented a critical step forward towards ushering in 26 Both a sound historical consciousness and a heartfelt soul-searching into any past wrongdoings are required in order to establish solid peace and stability between nations. A countrys true valour is proven when it confronts the dark side of its history and endeavours to rectify past wrongdoings.It is the firm conviction of the Korean Government that respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, should be the guiding principle for stable international relations. No country should abuse international legal procedures or the concept of the rule of law in order to infringe upon the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other countries or distort historical justice.The Republic of Korea is actively contributing to the global efforts being undertaken in pursuit of a world without nuclear weapons. The Seoul Nuclear Security Summit held last March brought together leaders from across the world to galvanize the vision and the determination of the international community to achieve a peaceful world without nuclear terrorism. During the Summit, the Korean Government played a leading role in forging a consensus to take important practical steps, such as the substantial reduction of nuclear materials, the promotion of the universality of international conventions and cooperation to combat illicit trafficking of nuclear materials. I am delighted that the High-level Meeting on Countering Nuclear Terrorism, which was convened this morning, has provided new momentum to further energize the efforts seen at the Seoul Summit for the prevention of nuclear and radiological terrorism. Furthermore, existing and emerging threats in cyberspace, such as rampant transnational cybercrime and potential cyber conflicts, present a serious challenge. It is therefore imperative that the international community address those threats. By hosting the 2013 Conference on Cyberspace, the Republic of Korea hopes to contribute in multiple ways to the ongoing global efforts to maximize the benefits of digital networks. We further believe that the event will provide an unparalleled opportunity to pool our efforts to cope with threats stemming from the misuse of information and communication technologies.The North Korean nuclear programme continues to pose a threat, not only to the security of the Korean peninsula and North-East Asia, but indeed to The Republic of Korea is also taking an active part in the discussions on shaping the post-2015 development framework. We fully recognize the importance of a comprehensive approach that takes into account the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.The aspiration for human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic values is the primary driving force for the advancement of humanity. Today, many countries have been striving to advocate human rights in tandem with democracy. The United Nations, as the epicentre of the international communitys efforts to promote and protect human rights, has provided timely assistance to such countries.Recently, we witnessed the strong desire of people in the Middle East and North Africa to realize their aspirations for democracy and respect for human rights. The recent positive developments in Myanmar are also well worth noting in that regard. However, while those changes are still unfolding, enormous challenges and difficulties still lie ahead. In Syria, a great number of civilians have been killed and gross violations of human rights have been witnessed. With high hopes towards the efforts of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, the Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria, the Korean Government will stand by the Syrian people through this time of suffering together with the international community.The Korean Government expresses deep concern at the recent attacks against diplomats and diplomatic missions in several places. Such violence cannot be justified regardless of the motivation.Putting an end to sexual violence against women in armed conflict is another issue that warrants serious attention. Wartime sexual violence is a fundamental infringement of human rights and is, in fact, an affront to human dignity and integrity. History has left important lessons that warn against such egregious acts.The Republic of Korea would like to urge the United Nations system and all Member States to do their utmost to put an end to such atrocities, not only by taking all measures to protect women and girls in armed conflict, but also by providing effective remedies and reparations for victims and ending impunity by bringing the offenders to justice in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. 27Prince Abdulaziz bin Abdullah (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, it gives me great pleasure to convey to Mr. Vuk Jeremic my sincere congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. We wish him every success in the performance of his duties and responsibilities, particularly under the current critical circumstances in which the international community finds itself at present. I would also take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude and appreciation to his predecessor, Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, who fulfilled his mandate with wisdom and professionalism. Moreover, it gives me pleasure to commend once more the great efforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in serving the Organization and promoting its message aimed at achieving international peace and security, especially under difficult and critical circumstances. The Palestinian issue, which is at the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict, has been a constant challenge for the United Nations since its inception more than 60 years ago. The cause of the stalemate is Israels attitude. We all know how intransigent Israel has been in its positions, which have undermined negotiations and have emptied all discussions of any meaning. Moreover, Israel has taken unilateral actions that could lead to more complications in the occupied Palestinian territories and to undermining the efforts of Arab countries and others in the international community to reach a just, comprehensive and lasting solution by establishing an independent, viable and contiguous Palestinian State, with Jerusalem as its capital. The situation requires that the international community, as represented by the United Nations, move quickly in order to put an end to the calamity that the situation represents for the Palestinian people and provide all manner of support and assistance for the Palestinian Authority. My country finds that Palestine must receive full membership in the United Nations, as that is its natural and legitimate right, and we should all help the Palestinians to achieve that objective. For its part, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is sparing no effort in fulfilling its commitment to the peace process with respect to our Palestinian brethren by providing various types of support and assistance. The issue of Syria is a very complex and exacerbated one and has led to the killing and displacement of tens of thousands of people. The international community has shown its inability to act, because of divisions in the very basis of the international non-proliferation regime. As long as the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea continues to pursue its nuclear and missile programmes, achieving the goal of sustainable peace on the Korean peninsula and in the region will remain far off. Unfortunately, the international communitys aspirations were shattered once again when the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea launched a long-range missile in April 2012. In response to that provocative action, the Security Council reaffirmed that the international community will not tolerate the continued pursuit by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea of its nuclear and missile programmes by issuing a firm and resolute presidential statement in an unprecedentedly swift manner (PRS).We urge with concern that the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea should take concrete measures aimed at denuclearization, which will also open an avenue to improving the livelihood of its people. At the same time, we sincerely hope that the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea will listen to the international communitys call for the improvement of that countrys human rights situation, as repeatedly affirmed in the relevant United Nations resolutions.As a country that has risen from the ashes of war, we have learned the values of peace and security. In that context, we earnestly hope to have the opportunity to promote such values by serving as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the 2013-2014 term. The Republic of Korea is determined to fulfil that role with the greatest enthusiasm and devotion. We hope that States Members of the United Nations understand and support our bid for membership in the Council.We are united by the ideals set out in the United Nations Charter. In pursuit of international peace and security, the continued promotion of social and economic development and the promotion of human rights, we should embrace a spirit of cooperation and tolerance, with the United Nations at the centre of international efforts to that end. The Republic of Korea will persist in fully playing its part in the invaluable work of the United Nations, taking on the various challenges that humanity will continue to confront. "}}
