{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to Mr. Vuk Jeremic upon his election to serve as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. It is my firm belief that, with his extensive experience and constructive initiatives, he will guide the Assembly towards achieving its objectives while serving the common interests of all its members.May I also take this opportunity to extend my profound congratulations to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, on the successful discharge of his duties.Likewise, I would like to commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for tirelessly leading United Nations efforts to meet its obligations and achieve its objectives, as well as working to improve the overall working methods of the United Nations.Over the past two years, the international community has encountered complex challenges in all areas. Regional political complexity and unrest, especially in the Middle East, seem unlikely to be resolved any time soon. The use of violence in any form, as seen in attacks on diplomatic compounds in Syria, is unacceptable to us. In addition, the global economic and financial crisis affecting all parts of the world has reached an alarming point, causing great concern for all nations, and even for the European Union — a major economic force.Such crises have challenged the capacity and credibility of the existing global governance mechanisms designed by the international community to address global challenges. This is a clear indication that our joint efforts and actions have not yet produced tangible outcomes.Negotiations on climate change have shown no progress, although the Kyoto Protocol is expiring this year. Efforts to formulate an international instrument to govern arms trade and prevent illegal trading, which started some years ago, have also failed. There has also been little commitment on the part of the developed countries to help the most vulnerable groups than serve as a pretext for illegal interference in the domestic affairs of States.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone is entitled to an international order in which their rights can be fully realized. Those who use military force and sanctions, bypassing the Charter, engage in illicit supplies of arms, or provide cover for terrorists grossly violate this right.Russia stands for the implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and respect for the traditional values on which human civilization is based and where all world religions converge. This is a moral foundation of modern society. It is the cement that bonds together nations and peoples. In recent years, these values have been put to the test by displays of immorality, extremism and racial intolerance. Of similar concern are the even more assertive actions of those who, citing freedom of speech, condone the glorification of the Nazis and their accomplices and desecrate the memory of the victims of the Second World War and the victors of fascism. Such actions are incompatible with the obligations of States under the Charter of the United Nations.Let me recall that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights directly prohibits the propaganda of war and incitement of national and religious discord. This means that freedom of speech and assembly cannot be used to justify the promotion of Nazi or other radical or extremist views, in violation of the basic principles and norms of international law.Yesterday, the Human Rights Council endorsed a resolution proposed by Russia on the interrelation of human rights and traditional values. It is regrettable that a number of Western States voted against this document, which is especially relevant today.Progress towards genuine partnership in international relations is possible only on the basis of equality and mutual respect. The course of events in the world leaves no alternative for anyone but to join efforts in order to build a stable, equitable and democratic international system. It would be possible to resist this objective trend and try to preserve the old order for some time, but such resistance would cost yet more lives, suffering and destruction. Let us display our vision and, instead of looking back at the history of previous centuries, take the side of the events unfolding before us today, and answer the call for strong collective statesmanship.24 Despite those achievements, the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic continues to face numerous challenges and constraints. In addition to problems resulting from the global and regional economic crises, natural calamities and the remnants of war, such as unexploded ordnance, continue to harm peoples lives and pose major obstacles to national social and economic development, including the attainment of the MDGs. In that regard, we call upon all countries to become party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions with a view to fully banning the use of such weapons.The Lao Peoples Democratic Republic feels honoured to be entrusted with hosting the 9th Asia-Europe Summit Meeting, which will be held on 5 and 6 November in Vientiane, the capital of the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic. That will provide a great opportunity for the leaders of Asia and Europe to discuss and exchange their views on global issues of mutual interest. The international community wishes to see the restoration of peace and stability in the Middle East. The conflict between Israel and Palestine will not be resolved without the full implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions supporting the establishment of two States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace. The Lao Peoples Democratic Republic reaffirms its support for the membership of Palestine to the United Nations.The economic, financial and trade embargo imposed on the Republic of Cuba has long caused considerable hardship to the standard of living of the Cuban people. That embargo must be unconditionally and immediately lifted.Owing to their geographical locations, the landlocked developing countries are among the most vulnerable Members of the United Nations. The special challenges and major development obstacles they face are the result of their great distance from world markets and high transit transport costs, which impede their national sustainable development efforts. Each year, the landlocked countries bear a heavy financial burden in the effort to improve their transit transport infrastructure network in order to ensure that their export products, which constitute a crucial part of their national income, have better access to world markets. Those problems are compounded when their national economies are affected by financial or social crises, natural disasters and climate change, inter alia. In addition, 50 per of countries: the least developed countries (LDCs), the landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), and the small island developing States.In the light of the current situation, it is more crucial than ever to strengthen the United Nations, the only universal Organization, in order to increase its effectiveness in addressing important global issues. To that end, all Member States should strive to extend their full support and cooperation to revitalize the United Nations, finding a harmonious balance between national and international interests in order to address the enormous global challenges in a timely and effective manner.In the current context, regional organizations have played an increasingly important role in addressing the global issues. In that connection, more and more countries in the world now attach greater importance to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the ever-expanding ASEAN-initiated cooperation frameworks. ASEAN is entering a crucial stage in implementing its leaders commitment to establishing an ASEAN community comprised of three pillars — a political-security community, an economic community and a social-cultural community — by 2015. I firmly believe that, by utilizing its own resources combined with external support, especially from its dialogue partners, ASEAN will be able to realize its ultimate goal of becoming a community that is politically stable, economically integrated and socially and culturally harmonious, thus contributing to the cause of peace and prosperity in the region and the world at large.As a member of the international community, the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic has done its utmost to fulfil its international obligations by pursuing a policy of cooperation with other countries based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and respect for the principles of national independence, sovereignty and non-interference in each others internal affairs, thus building an international environment conducive to national development. Over the past year, despite numerous challenges, the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic has continued to enjoy political stability and social order. There has been good progress in developing the national economy. That has laid a solid foundation for attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 and created conditions conducive to the countrys graduation from least developed country status by 2020. 25the world we hope for. The outcome document, entitled “The future we want” (resolution , annex), marks a substantial advancement for sustainable development. The task before us now is to capitalize on our achievements thus far and exert even greater effort on follow-up actions such as developing sustainable development goals, strengthening the institutional framework and mobilizing finance.As part of such endeavours, the Republic of Korea established the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI). Sixteen countries signed the agreement to establish the GGGI on the margins of the Rio+20 meeting, and the Institute will be launched as an international organization starting in October. The GGGI will engage in a range of activities for disseminating the green growth paradigm, in which the economy and the environment form a virtuous cycle. Moreover, the Korean Government is prepared to step up its contribution to international efforts to achieve a sustainable future by hosting the secretariat of the Green Climate Fund. The Republic of Korea stands ready to render wholehearted support for the successful launch and stable operation of the Fund.The Republic of Korea is keen on contributing to the balanced and harmonious development of the international community and is fully cooperating in such efforts in the context of the United Nations. The Korean Government continues to increase its official development assistance to help achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. The Republic of Korea underscored the importance of inclusive growth and development partnership at the 2010 Seoul Summit of the Group of Twenty and the Fourth High-level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, held in Busan in 2011. In June, the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation was launched for the implementation of the Busan commitments. The Busan Forum and the launch of the Global Partnership will mark a turning point for international development cooperation by broadening our perspective from aid effectiveness to development effectiveness.Our own experience has taught us that investment in education is at the heart of effective development. In that vein, we are confident that the Education First initiative of the Secretary-General will, indeed, provide a solid foundation for achieving the international development goals. The Korean Government extends its strong support for the initiative.cent of the LLDCs are also LDCs. I therefore urge the international community to devote greater attention and provide assistance to that vulnerable group of countries through full implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action, as well as to play an active part in the 10-year review of the implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action, to be held in 2014.The Lao Peoples Democratic Republic reiterates once again its firm commitment and determination to continue working closely with the international community to build a peaceful world under a just and more democratic new order, based on cooperation with all countries in tackling the various global challenges facing us. I am convinced that only through firm determination will we be able to achieve the immediate and long-term development objectives and ensure that the world is secure, peaceful and prosperous. "}}
