{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, I am pleased to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremic on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I would like to commend Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for his leadership as President at the sixty-sixth session. I also wish to express our profound gratitude and appreciation to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his valuable efforts to achieve the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.Three years ago, a despot who ruled my country for 42 years with tyranny and oppression stood at this very rostrum and tore up a copy of the Charter, saying that he did not recognize the authority of the document. Today, I am standing on the very same rostrum to assure the Assembly of my delegations support and respect for the Charter.Today, I stand before the Assembly and the whole world to apologize for all the harm and the crimes committed by that despot against so many innocent people, as well as to apologize for the extortion and terrorism he inflicted on so many States. I want to assure the Organization that the Libyan people are determined to build a State that respects its neighbours, its international obligations and human rights, and that believes that genuine peace in the world will not be realized unless the conscience of every individual is brimming with peace. Libya will be a land of peace and security and a strong force for peace.I am speaking today before this international gathering to convey the greetings of the Libyan people, whose revolt on 17 February 2011 turned into a comprehensive, explosive revolution that shook the very foundations of the regime of the despot Muammar Al-Qadhafi, who declared that he would burn and destroy Libya and make it swim in a sea of blood. He killed thousands of civilians, recruited mercenaries from everywhere, assaulted peoples honour, ordered his militias and mercenaries to rape minors, and destroyed cities. However, our people did not kneel; they did not back down. Thousands of martyrs were lost among the wounded and missing. The price of freedom was paid in blood, lives, amputated limbs and lost youth.In this forum, on behalf of the Libyan people, I salute the United Nations system, which stood with our people, with the will of freedom against blood lust and annihilation, and adopted Security Council resolutions and sixteenth, respectively, putting it among the top reformer countries.On our road towards sustained development, progress and prosperity, we remain fully engaged and committed to carrying out all reforms and taking all of the measures required to continue successfully on the path to European Union integration. This is not an alternative but a long-term choice carefully pursued over the years, and we are determined to make it happen.In the weeks ahead, we expect a favourable decision by the Council of Ministers of the European Union on our bid for the status of candidate country to the European Union. That merit-based decision will constitute another milestone in Albanias journey to European integration and will place our commitments and our responsibilities at a higher stage of the process.In conclusion, let me assure the Assembly that Albania remains committed to international cooperation and is determined to continue to offer its contribution to advancing peace, freedom and security, and respect for human rights, fighting poverty, promoting sustainable development and prosperity, and, last but not least, protecting the environment."}}
