{"speech":{"0":" We are convening in this Assembly at a time when we are witnessing a worrisome phenomenon, namely, senseless violence spreading through an entire region as a result of a senseless offence to religious feelings. More than any other organization, the United Nations stands for the ideals of tolerance, understanding and mutual respect. A strong message should therefore emerge from this debate. The hateful slander of people on the basis of their culture or religion is unacceptable. It is an abuse of the right to freedom of expression. However, we must emphasize just as clearly that violence cannot be justified by insults, however understandable the outrage may be. Such ongoing events also tell us that we must reach many more people in our effort to promote the values of the United Nations around the globe.When we last met, a year ago, we heard many calls from this rostrum to bring an end to the crisis in Syria. Since then, the violence has turned into a civil war that puts the United Nations to shame. We have seen open division in the Security Council and little interest by the parties to the conflict in a United Nations-led mediation. Instead, the situation on the ground has further escalated. The entire region is now threatened with instability. The blatant disregard for the lives and rights of civilians, of women and children in particular, is simply shocking. It is a crisis with profound and lasting effects for the three main pillars of the United Nations: peace and security, development, and human rights. It is therefore also an existential challenge for this Organization. The United Nations is only as effective as its political organs allow it to be. The crisis must therefore make us think in general terms about the lessons we should learn.The situation in Syria is clearly of burning concern to the membership as a whole as a human security crisis and a threat to international peace and security. At the same time, the Security Council is unable to carry out its tasks under the Charter because of disagreement among its permanent members. It is therefore essential that the General Assembly step in and play a more active role, as it has done on some occasions. That is all the more important as we are confronted by the failure to fulfil the responsibility to protect a civilian population â€” a principle adopted in this Hall at the highest political level.The stalemate in the Council demonstrates that we must look at the way in which the veto power is and can of women, as was affirmed by the Minister for Social Services during the consideration of the report on Bahamas by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women at its fifty-second session, held in July. The Bahamas, nevertheless, remains concerned about the increasing incidences of non-communicable diseases among the population, in particular women, who are disproportionately affected by such preventable diseases.We can draw much strength, wisdom and inspiration from the remarkable successes of our nations athletes nationally and subregionally at this years Olympics. On behalf of my delegation, I would like to pay tribute to the youth of the world for their stellar displays of camaraderie and talent at the recent Olympics. In this forum, I wish to salute in particular the gold medal athletes of the Bahamas, namely, Demetrius Pinder, Michael Mathieu, Chris Brown and Ramon Miller. Indeed, the performances of the athletes from the entire Caribbean Community region are noteworthy, particularly those of our sister countries Grenada, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. Those examples can be seen as contributing as much to peace and development in our world as our deliberations and initiatives at this session, hence, our warmest congratulations to them all.My delegation also wishes to record in this forum the passing of my late friend and brother, the late Paul L. Adderley, who was the longest-serving Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Bahamas. His tenure included the most critical foreign policy challenges of an independent Bahamas to date. Sadly, he died on 19 September. He believed in this world body and its tenets and exemplified how it can assist small States. It is therefore only fitting that we mark and record his passing.The Bahamas continues to believe that mankind can aspire to and achieve a higher inner strength that not can only cause us to excel even beyond our dreams, but also can lift all around us, even nations and the entire world. May each one of us therefore reach for that inner strength, change our world and transform an agenda of problems into covenants of partnerships. It remains as true as always that we need the United Nations."}}
