{"speech":{"0":" By virtue of its historical conviction, Mexico has always been a strategic ally of the United Nations. As one of the founding Members of the United Nations, we fully share its fundamental precepts.This is the last session of the General Assembly I will attend as President of Mexico. Over the past six years, my country has taken part in many different forums to pave the way for United Nations initiatives. We have endeavoured to make it the main body for dialogue, peace and security, and for the rule of law, including, in particular, the effective exercise of international law. Today the world faces challenges that threaten the very existence and viability of humankind. The first of those is the current economic emergency and the urgent need to promote global trade and growth with strong job creation. That problem has plunged entire populations in crisis and prevented developing nations from overcoming setbacks with respect to poverty, ignorance and marginalization.When Mexico became President of the Group of 20 (G-20) in 2012, our mission was clear: to reconcile the apparently competing interests of developing and developed nations. It is no secret that at the previous meeting of the G-20, in Cannes, we were unable to make as much progress as we would have liked towards adopting measures to advance the global economy. For that reason, the Mexican Government made it a priority to build a broader consensus. We brought as many countries as possible into the process, along with representatives of the widest possible range of sectors, including unions, entrepreneurs, civil society trade rules and practices and conditionalities imposed on the transfer of technology and access to necessary financing for development. We urgently need a new people-centred form of global economic governance that aims at consolidating cooperation between development partners on the basis of mutual benefit and interests.I have laid out our vision, which is shared by the Egyptian people. I have also attempted to briefly outline Egypts views on the main issues, which is to say the vision of Egyptian youth, children, women and men, Muslim and non-Muslim, on all important questions in the Middle East, Africa and the rest of the world. From that perspective, I am sure that the United Nations is capable of assuming its intended role of effectively addressing all global and regional issues and challenges through dialogue, understanding and joint cooperation, in accordance with the principles of international law.Post-revolutionary Egypt will spare no effort to deal sincerely with all Members of the Organization. We will always remain in the forefront of international endeavours aimed at achieving freedom, justice, social justice and dignity for all peoples, as well as security and stability for all our countries.I look forward with great optimism, and I see the peace that we call for prevailing all over the world — a peace based on justice and conferring on all their undiminished rights, a peace that does not discriminate between people for any reason. That peace will not come about until we all cooperate, until we realize that we are all equal and share many aspirations and ambitions. That is the peace whose message I bring to to the Assembly — a peace of right and justice, stability and development, interdependence of interests and benefits, love and mutual respect. I do not believe that achieving this will raise difficulties for any of us if we extend the hand of cooperation, sincere intention and righteous work. God is our witness. We are all hopeful that we will see a better future for the world."}}
