{"speech":{"0":" First and foremost, I would like to congratulate Mr. Jeremic on his well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. His country, Serbia, and Myanmar have traditionally enjoyed a close friendship and cooperation. Under his able leadership, the General Assembly will hold deliberations on measures to address the challenges faced by the world today. I am confident that his great wisdom, rich experience and great diplomatic skills will guide our discussions to produce the desired outcomes.I would also like to take this opportunity to extend our sincere thanks and appreciation to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his outstanding leadership at the sixty-sixth session.Myanmar consistently pursues an independent and active foreign policy, a basic tenet of which is to actively contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. In so doing, we encourage efforts to settle differences among nations by peaceful and amicable means. Our position is consistent with the essence of the theme of the current session, namely, “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means”.There are different views and assessments regarding the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, held in Brazil in June. A number of important decisions were taken on various issues, such as the renewal of commitments, the linkage of sustainable development to the Millennium Development Goals, renewable energy and the establishment of arrangements for better coordination on sustainable development. Member States must turn 13In order to redress the situation in northern Myanmar, leaders of the Union Peace-making Work Committee and the Kachin armed group are holding informal consultations and are working to further strengthen confidence-building measures. We consider any loss of life and property on either side in the armed conflict as a loss for the country.While the Government is resolutely pursuing political, social and economic reforms, some unfortunate and unexpected issues have arisen. A case in point is the recent communal violence in Rakhine State. In that connection, I would like to mention in the first place that the people inhabiting our country, regardless of race, religion and gender, have the right to live in peace and security.As the Assembly is aware, an independent national-level investigation commission has been established to look into the issue. To ensure impartiality, the commission is composed of representatives from all strata of society, including widely respected personalities from the Buddhist, Muslim, Christian and Hindu faiths. Upon completion of its task, the commission will submit its findings and recommendations to me.Demonstrating our determination to resolve the issue in a transparent manner, we have facilitated field visits to Rakhine State by representatives from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, United Nations agencies, the United States and resident foreign diplomats in Myanmar. Access is being facilitated to those organizations that are willing to provide relief assistance to both communities without discrimination.The issue at hand cannot be resolved overnight. It will be resolved by taking short-term and long-term measures through a multifaceted approach, taking into account political, economic and social aspects. I sincerely believe that as an independent and sovereign State, Myanmar has done the right thing to secure our borders and to safeguard our sovereignty. We will do our utmost to resolve the issue in line with international norms.I am well aware of the fact that Myanmars democratic transformation process will be a complex and delicate one that requires patience. To complete the process, we certainly need the understanding and support of the United Nations and its States Members, the international community as a whole and, last but not least, the people of Myanmar. At the same time, it is of worker and employer organizations; and increased participation by the people in the political process.At the current stage of the political process, we can see the emergence of democratic traits, such as the increasing participation of various political forces and their mutual tolerance, magnanimity, the expanded scope of political participation, representation and accountability. Our Government and other stakeholders have fostered a new political culture of tolerance and dialogue.The former main opposition leader, Nobel laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, now participates in parliament, not only in her capacity as a member but also as Chairperson of the parliamentary Rule of Law and Stability Committee. She is also in New York this week. As a Myanmar citizen, I would like to congratulate her on the honour that she has received in this country in recognition of her efforts for democracy.Our countrys political progress is strengthening its political legitimacy. That, in turn, facilitates the establishment of basic political stability, thereby paving the way for the economic and social transformation necessary for better living standards for the people.The legislative body has also developed well and functions more effectively at every sitting. Parliament has now adopted landmark laws through democratic practices. We are promulgating laws and by-laws, taking into account the fact that economic development must not widen the gap between the rich and the poor. The rights of citizens must be protected. The natural environment must be preserved. Our workers should enjoy rights in line with international standards. We give carefull consideration to investments in the extractive sectors, such as energy, to ensure transparency and impartiality.We believe that the cessation of all armed conflicts is a prerequisite to building genuine democracy. As such, we place high priority on achieving lasting peace in the country. In accordance with our motto “From war to peace”, we are striving to put an end to the long-standing problems in regions inhabited by our ethnic groups. To date, we have reached ceasefire agreements with 10 armed groups. We will continue the peace talks, while further strengthening confidence-building measures. Peace negotiations at the national level will then continue towards a final peace agreement, which would completely end the armed hostilities.14 "}}
