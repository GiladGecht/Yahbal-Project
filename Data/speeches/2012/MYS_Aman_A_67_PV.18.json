{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, allow me to congratulate Mr. Jeremic on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I am confident that he will successfully steer the proceedings of this session in an efficient and effective manner. I assure him of Malaysias full cooperation and support throughout his presidency. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the previous President, His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his leadership and guidance throughout the sixty-sixth session. We therefore reiterate the validity and relevance of the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and of other international instruments. Such values must remain the main source of inspiration in the pursuit of political and lasting solutions to conflicts. Mozambique thus believes that multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations, the African Union and other subregional organizations, play a fundamental role in the pursuit of peace and development. The release of the distasteful and insulting film Innocence of Muslims caused a wave of widespread protests across the Muslim world. The problem was compounded by the publication of offensive caricatures, which further angered Muslims. It is hard to understand how those responsible could resort to such actions, knowing that they would offend and provoke 2 billion Muslims, as anything other than blatant and malicious intent and purpose. The resolution of conflicts is a crucial condition for the achievement of internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, in particular by African countries and least developed countries. In that context, as part of the ongoing discussions on establishing a post-2015 development agenda, Member States must act jointly in seeking points of convergence that will make it possible to adopt consensus and sustainable solutions for the well- being of our people. It is our obligation as peace-loving people and responsible Governments to prevent a small minority of bigots from sowing the seed of hatred between Muslims and the Western world. We categorize those people as extremists. They insult Islam and advocate religious hatred. Such extremists have shown absolutely no regard for the implications of their actions. While we condemn the irresponsible actions of those who intentionally incite hatred, we are equally saddened by the violent reaction that ensued. In that connection, we would like to express our optimism over the consensus understanding reached at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. We are aware of the fact that the success of such an agreement depends on an integrated approach towards the economic, social, cultural and environmental components, as well as on defining a comprehensive framework for resource mobilization under the terms of the common vision of resolution , entitled “The future we want”. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate Mozambiques commitment to continuing to cooperate with the United Nations in seeking peaceful solutions to conflicts and to peace, stability and sustainable development.
