{"speech":{"0":" I extend warm congratulations to Mr. Jeremic and his country, Serbia, on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. My delegation is confident that, under his leadership, this session will address all burning issues on its agenda. I assure him of my delegations cooperation and support. I also wish to thank his predecessor for presiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. Similarly, I wish to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on assuming his second mandate as Secretary-General at the beginning of this year.The unresolved conflicts around the world demand commitment and resolve from us all in order to find durable solutions. I therefore commend the President for choosing the theme for the debate at this session, namely, “Adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means”. Namibia firmly believes that, if we all dedicate ourselves to finding lasting solutions to conflicts by peaceful means, our collective efforts will be successful. There is no better way to achieve peace than by upholding the cardinal principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes, as provided for under Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter.days have been lost in State schools and colleges in the past 10 years. That data is equivalent to three school years of 200 days. That means that a boy or a girl who has completed ninth grade in their studies has, in fact, only received a sixth-grade education. Clearly, that is a step backwards for society in general. According to figures from the Department of Education, in 2009, 80 school days were lost, in 2010, 30 days and, in 2011, 40 days. All those days correspond to calls for massive teacher walk-outs. According to a study of the National Independent University of Honduras, the countrys principal university, of the top 100 colleges, that leading State college is ranked in seventeenth position. What an injustice.It is our poorest children and young people, those who cannot afford private education, who go to State schools. We are condemning them to remain victims of the most serious exclusion. Those who most need them are denied opportunities. Why do we not declare in this Assembly of peoples that classrooms are sanctuaries of education and must never be closed?We must continue our efforts to ensure greater access for the poor to the productive sectors of the national economy. Rapid, fair and sustainable growth is the true productive development of the country and, along with education and health care, the best way to reduce poverty and extreme poverty.From the Office of the President and the First Lady, who is here with me at the Assembly, among others, we are working on a very important conditional cash transfer programme. It currently reaches 30 per cent of our poor families. That is an immediate and specific response to social exclusion.Our geographic location makes Honduras one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Along with our socio-economic characteristics, that compels us, both nationally and regionally, to remain constantly vigilant in order to respond to natural threats and disasters. That is why we deem it key to participate in all specialized forums, in particular the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. Today and now, in this Hall, Honduras reiterates its commitment to the international community to the comprehensive reform of the United Nations system. That will help to strengthen the principle of universality on the basis of just, fair and inclusive representation. The challenge is for us all and our commitment is universal. That is why we are gathered here now.50 Namibia resolutely rejects the secessionist attempts in northern Mali and the destruction of ancient shrines in Timbuktu. We wish to commend the role played by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in helping to resolve the conflicts in those two countries. At the same time, we urge the international community to provide support and assistance to ECOWAS.Namibia welcomes the recent positive political developments in Somalia, including the election of His Excellency Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as President of that country. I congratulate him and wish him well in the noble task of bringing normalcy and stability to that sister country. The international community should continue to support the people of Somalia as they embark upon the path to rebuild their country.For many decades, the people of Western Sahara have been denied their inalienable right to self-determination and independence. Namibia reiterates its call for the immediate and unconditional implementation of the United Nations Settlement Plan, leading to the holding of a free and fair referendum in Western Sahara.Equally, we wish to reaffirm our unequivocal support for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and national independence on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions.Each year during the general debate, the majority of States Members of the United Nations express their concern over the continued economic, commercial and financial blockade unilaterally imposed against the Republic of Cuba, with its adverse effect on the Cuban people. Thus, Namibia reiterates its call for the immediate and unconditional lifting of the embargo against Cuba.Namibia attaches great importance to sustainable development and the search for the best ways to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. In that regard, we will continue to actively cooperate with the international community to address climate change.In that context, Namibia seeks the support of Member States in hosting the secretariat of the Green Climate Fund in our capital city, Windhoek If successful, that would provide an opportunity for a developing country to host a United Nations agency of great importance. Given the opportunity, Namibia stands ready to discharge its obligations arising from In that regard, we should renew the original commitment to peace and progress as essential values of the United Nations. Namibia believes that respect for the sovereign equality of States, territorial integrity and independence constitute the pillars of international law and, indeed, the bedrock of peaceful relations among nations. The violation of any of those principles poses a serious threat to international peace and security.Regional and subregional organizations are important partners in solving conflicts in affected areas throughout the world. Their contribution to conflict resolution is provided for under the United Nations Charter. There is therefore a compelling need for the United Nations to take into account the views of regional organizations in the areas of mediation and peacemaking. Such institutions should be fully supported in finding lasting solutions to violent conflicts around the world.In Africa, since its inception, the African Union Peace and Security Council has cooperated with the United Nations Security Council towards those shared goals of conflict resolution. Similarly, the subregion of the Southern African Development Community has established initiatives to resolve political conflicts in the region through mediation. However, we are concerned about the deteriorating security situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. We therefore urge the international community to support the regional initiative aimed at resolving that conflict and to provide humanitarian assistance to displaced persons. We call on all neighbouring countries to work together with the Congolese authorities to help resolve the conflict and to ensure that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is not violated.In Madagascar, we urge the Malagasy political actors to expedite the full implementation of the road map leading to the holding of free, fair, inclusive and credible elections.With regard to the Sudan and South Sudan, Namibia calls on the two countries to resolve all outstanding issues peacefully. In the Darfur region of the Sudan, we urge the Government and the other parties concerned to find a negotiated and peaceful solution to the conflict.We denounce the unconstitutional changes of Government in Mali and Guinea-Bissau that took place, respectively, in March and April this year. Equally, 51Let us rededicate ourselves to the principle of the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means in order to save current and succeeding generations from the scourge of war and build a prosperous future for our children."}}
