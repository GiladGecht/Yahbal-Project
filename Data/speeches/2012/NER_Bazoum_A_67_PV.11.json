{"speech":{"0":" I would first like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session on his election. I also wish to congratulate his country for that success, which allows him to manage the Organization during his term of office. I would also like to congratulate the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, whose term of office was a very 26 It is said that history has more imagination than do men, because events often escape the control of those who cause them. It is my hope that this saying will not apply to the Arab Spring, which has created turmoil from which we hope good will come. Allow me to recall the fact that at the Group of Eight Summit in Deauville on 26 May 2011, President Issoufou drew the attention of the Heads of State and Government present on the need for them not to lose sight of the foreseeable consequences of a Libyan conflict in the Sahel-Saharan region.His fears were unfortunately confirmed with the outbreak of the rebellion in Mali on 17 January, triggered by elements from Libya and followed by the coup detat of 22 March, which dealt democracy a severe blow while enabling the occupation of two thirds of Malian territory, not just by external forces, some of them from Libya, but also by terrorists and criminal organizations specializing in various types of trafficking, particularly drugs. In our view, the current situation in Mali constitutes a serious threat to the security and stability of the member countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), as well as the countries in the thick of things.The ambition of the jihadists who have subjugated northern Mali, destroying the patrimonial historic sites of Timbuktu, cutting off hands and forcing women to wear the burka, is to conquer the whole of West Africa and the Maghreb. Once they have achieved that goal, will they stop there? Of course not. They will immediately go on to attack Europe and the whole of the rest of the world. This is therefore a global threat, and the response should be global, too.It must be immediate and unhesitating, because we know well that postponing a fight always puts one at a disadvantage. Therefore the international community, and the Security Council in particular, has a duty to take responsibility for the crisis in Mali without delay in order to restore a united, democratic and secular Mali. An operational concept for military intervention should be drawn up and adopted within the framework of a coalition that should include troops from ECOWAS member States as well as from the countries involved and from other African countries wishing to take part. Such an operation should receive the firm and determined support of the friends of Mali and Africa among the great Powers. It should be carried out through a Security Council resolution in a framework based on any regulation of the global economy, the domination of banks, unfair trade and the growth of inequalities between and within nations are factors of disorder, crises and conflicts that disrupt world peace. The rise of terrorism and the increasingly strong probability of criminal forces controlling great areas will worsen tensions throughout the world.Anticipating international conflicts and disputes is the best way to prevent them. As international economic competition can lead to war, the anticipation of crises should create specific conditions for global economic growth that benefits all. To do that, there should be mechanisms to regulate the global economy with the goal, among others, of ending the hegemony of financial capital and unfair trade. The end of the hegemony of financial capital should allow us to direct available financial resources towards investments in the real economy rather than towards speculation.The end of unfair trade will allow countries that produce raw materials, such as the Niger, to draw greater benefit from them, particularly through the change that generates added value. If a country such as mine were able to get a fair price for its raw materials and to establish real control over their exploitation, then the Millennium Development Goals could be achieved by 2015. That is one of the ambitions of the programme for the renaissance of the Niger that President Issoufou presented. On the basis of that programme, the Government has just drawn up an economic and social development plan for 2012 to 2015. For financing the programme, the Niger is organizing a donors meeting to be held in Paris on 13 and 14 November. The 3N initiative — Nigeriens Nourishing Nigeriens — is an integral and important part of the plan. I take the opportunity here to invite all partners of the Niger, both bilateral and multilateral, both public and private, to take an active part.Allow me also to take the opportunity to thank all those who have responded positively to the appeal that our President launched here on 23 September 2011 during his address to the Asembly at its sixty-sixth session, calling for assistance to the people of the Niger following that years mediocre harvest. The mobilization of the people and the Government, as well as all our partners, enabled us to prevent the drought from leading to famine, while creating the conditions to prepare for the 2012-2013 harvest. The results are very promising despite the recent f looding in the country. 27must comply with its international commitments and obligations relating to human rights. Justice must be done in all cases of violations of human rights and all those who are guilty must be permitted a fair trial, even if it was not something they allowed their victims. Romania has stated throughout that it is imperative that the international community curb the escalating violence in Syria; and of course we favour a political solution.In that regard, I would like to voice our firm support for the mission of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi in his new capacity as Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria. We were also a wholehearted supporter of the full implementation of the Joint Special Envoys six-point plan for Syria and, similarly, gave full and direct support to the activitiees of the United Nations Supervision Mission in the Syrian Arab Republic. In that context, I would like to remind the Assembly that Romanian monitors were part of its structure. I strongly believe that the only future for Syria must be an inclusive one for all Syrians, irrespective of religion or ethnic group. Any other option would be nothing less than a nightmare.The time has come for a more structured response on the part of the United Nations, based on a consensus approach by the Security Council. Obviously, we cannot and should not allow violence to prevail when people in Syria rely on our capacity to offer stability and predictability and when regional stability and security are at stake.Recent developments in the area of peace and security, at both the global and regional levels, do not offer many reasons for optimism. The year 2012 has seen limited progress with the Middle East peace process. The expectations raised by the statement of the Quartet for the Middle East on 23 September 2011 will remain unfulfilled as long as direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations are not resumed.Romania is a strong supporter of all efforts to achieve a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. We support all the initiatives of the Quartet and the full implementation of the road maps vision of two States, Israeli and Palestinian, living side by side in peace and security. We are also concerned about the lack of progress in finding negotiated solutions to protracted conflicts in the Black Sea region, such as those in Transnistria and Nagorno Karabakh and that in Georgia involving Abkhazia and South Ossetia. We the current efforts of ECOWAS but better coordinated with and controlled by the African Union through its Peace and Security Council."}}
