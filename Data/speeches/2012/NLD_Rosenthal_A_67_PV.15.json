{"speech":{"0":" Last month, I visited a refugee camp at the border between Turkey and Syria. I met children, women and men, who told me how they had escaped the violence and suffering in their home country. They had f led the bloodshed of a regime that is using indiscriminate violence against its own people. They had f led a country where children are being tortured, women raped and innocent civilians killed. They had lost their friends, family and homes, but they had not lost hope for a better future.One of the people whom I met near the border was Medya, the 25-year-old mother of a five-year-old girl. She had f led the city of Homs eight months earlier. Now, she travels back and forth between Homs and a refugee camp in Turkey at great personal danger. She risks her life to report to the world on the situation in Syria. Her reports are broadcast on major international networks.Medya told me about the terrible events that she had witnessed. I was touched by her sorrow and impressed by her determination. Her strong desire for freedom is something to which we can all relate. Those who have struggled for freedom do not give up easily. However, it is also clear that those refugees need the support of the international community at large. They need food, shelter and security. Ultimately, they need an effective United Nations and a strong international legal order.Promoting the international legal order is enshrined in the Constitution of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a mission that we share with many in this Assembly. Together with 49 other countries, we are helping to establish legal order and security in Afghanistan, for example. I want to pay tribute to the Dutch and the other men and women, soldiers and civilians, currently serving there.The Hague, a city of peace and justice, is known for its contribution to the international legal order. It is home to the International Court of Justice and the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which are both based peace process, where the fear of change is holding all those involved back. The parties concerned must face some uncomfortable truths in order to overcome the stumbling blocks. Bickering over who does what when is not the way forward. Forging common ground does not equate with giving in.Malta believes that the international community must redouble its efforts in that process and that there can be no rest until the world welcomes a truly stable and secure Middle East. We owe it to the Palestinians and the Israelis. We owe it to the wider Mediterranean region, which has now been deadlocked for far too long in the grips of that struggle. There really is no other option than that, for the alternative is further entrenchment of the positions held and more extremism and instability. Malta reaffirms its commitment to the efforts of the United Nations and the European Union, in particular towards the attainment of the goal of two viable States living side by side in harmony. However, that solution is possible only if it is feasible on the ground. That means no unilateral action, which would make it an unattainable reality.A year from now, we should no longer be talking of a Middle East peace process but of a Middle East in peace, and that is that. The sceptics among us will note that that is what was said last year and, of course, even the year before. For over 60 years, we have been making that call but we must not let the opportunity slip away once again. The Arab Spring shows us that we need to answer the call of history now. It can be different this time.The events happening around us highlight not only our sense of duty to promote and protect human rights worldwide but also our sense of responsibility, for the actions that we take or fail to take today will have a bearing on future generations. Malta drew the attention to that belief with its call for a universal declaration on human responsibilities, made in this very Hall during the sixty-fourth session of the Assembly in 2009. We know that we are not alone in the endeavour. We share with other Member States a commitment to solidarity, cohesive ideas and a harmonious discourse in favour of the sustainability of the planet and the stewardship of its peoples. That conviction encourages us to push forward with our efforts for we are certain that history will be on our side.In conclusion, our destiny is what we perceive our future to be. We are convinced that the United 36 Negotiations on a robust and effective arms trade treaty should recommence as soon as possible.A stronger legal order also promotes freedom. It promotes human rights, reinforces the responsibility to protect and helps prevent atrocities. Greater freedom means equal rights for men and women alike. Women make up 50 per cent of humankind. We need the full 100 per cent of humankind. It is in every countrys own interest to make sure that women are actively involved in society, the economy and politics. They must participate in the power structures as leaders of the world.Human rights cannot be imposed from the outside. But Governments carry the responsibility for observing their international human rights obligations and commitments. There is therefore a need to communicate constantly about the obligations and commitments.The role of the Human Rights Council in promoting freedom is crucial. We need to improve the way in which it functions. Countries that aspire to join the Council should be genuinely committed to respecting human rights. I am proud to reiterate our genuine commitment and to announce the Dutch candidature for the Human Rights Council from 2015 to 2017.People should be free to live their lives in peace and security. Therefore, every State has an obligation to prevent aggression, genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Prevention is key. But if countries cannot or will not act, the international community has a responsibility to protect.A strong international and domestic legal order promotes prosperity and, let me state it emphatically, economic growth. Trade, investment, innovation and economic development will all benefit from a stable, predictable and rules-based business climate. The economy cannot thrive in societies where human rights are violated, corruption is rampant and Government revenues are wasted. That is one of the lessons of the Arab awakening. Sustainable prosperity and sustainable economic growth depend upon a strong, legitimate and reliable legal order.For that matter, free trade agreements and a well-functioning World Trade Organization are crucial for stimulating growth. According to the World Bank, a new global trade deal would increase global welfare tremendously.at the Peace Palace. Next year, we will proudly celebrate its centenary. Former Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali recognized the role of the Netherlands in the international legal order by naming The Hague the legal capital of the world.We need international law to protect people, societies and nations, or, as former Secretary-General Kofi Annan recently wrote, the United Nations Charter was issued in the name of we the peoples, not we the Governments. So we need a stronger international legal order, first, to preserve peace and security; secondly, to protect freedom; and thirdly, to promote prosperity. That is the task that we face.A strong international legal order helps to preserve peace and security. To achieve that goal, we need greater unity. I regret the persistent disagreement in the Security Council. It has prevented the United Nations from taking decisive action on Syria. The world is in desperate need of a strong, united and determined Security Council.Mediation, arbitration and judicial settlement are indispensable for the peaceful settlement of conflicts. We should cherish and develop those tools, as Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson has so rightly said.Better implementation of existing treaties on non-proliferation, arms control and disarmament is of paramount importance. An effective international legal order means that countries are bound by their promises. Iran must completely fulfil its International Atomic Energy Agency obligations and abide by Security Council resolutions. The burden of proof is on Iran. As I said to my Iranian colleague, Minister Salehi, earlier this week: You are the one to convince the world of the peaceful character of your nuclear programme — not us.The international agendas on nuclear, chemical and conventional weapons must lead to concrete results and new treaties. The United Nations and the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva need to do better.The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague will this year celebrate its fifteenth anniversary. It should stand ready to assist in addressing the chemical weapons problem in Syria.The Netherlands will host the next Nuclear Security Summit, in 2014, as part of our efforts to enhance security and fight nuclear terrorism. 37protection and prosecution. Fifthly, countries that have not done so to date should join the International Criminal Court. That will ensure that civilians are protected and the perpetrators of atrocities are prosecuted. That takes me back to Syria. The Syrian crisis highlights the mounting challenges of the United Nations and its States Members. I applaud the active stance of the Secretary-General with regard to Syria. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Food Programme, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and many other organizations are providing crucial assistance to the victims of the violence. I want to pay explicit tribute to the Governments of Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan for their invaluable efforts to alleviate the suffering of the thousands of refugees.In conclusion, for me, meeting Мedya, that courageous Syrian journalist and mother, has given a voice to those refugees. I hope that I will meet Medya, that 25-year-old mother of a five-year-old child, again in the near future in Homs, Syria. I want to see her live in an inclusive and prosperous Syria, where democracy and human rights replace terror and violence. It is about democracy and human rights. That is our aim. I want to see her live in a Syria where jobs and economic opportunities have replaced poverty and despair. That woman, Мedya, has already shown the courage and the will to contribute to Syrias future. Together, we, the peoples of the United Nations, should show that same courage. Together, we must preserve peace, protect freedom and promote prosperity. Together, let us build a stronger international legal order."}}
