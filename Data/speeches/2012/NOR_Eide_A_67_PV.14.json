{"speech":{"0":" Leadership is about making choices. It is about the ability to make the right decision at the right moment and to have the stamina to deliver accordingly. It is about the will to help shape the future 30 In Colombia, the Government and representatives of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia have made the wise choice of entering into formal negotiations in order to end another age-old conflict.As Norways Foreign Minister, I am the Chair of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee for the Coordination of International Assistance to Palestinians. We met on the eve of this session of the General Assembly. I want to take this opportunity to share with Member States my deep concern about the state of play in the Israel-Palestine relationship. Exactly one year ago, we agreed here in New York that the Palestinian State-building process had reached a level where the institutions of State were in place. Great expectations were created, only to be frustrated. Time is running short — shorter than many seem to understand. There is significant fatigue among the Palestinian population. They may become inspired to look for alternative options — options that would severely hamper the prospects of Palestinians and Israelis alike. I see a similar fatigue emerging among the countries that are funding the Palestinian authorities.The two-State solution is the only path to sustainable peace, but the prospect of realizing a Palestinian State based on the two-State solution is diminishing as the expansion of Israeli settlements continues. Those actions remain the main obstacle to peace and they must stop. To get the peace process back on track, we need to break the impasse and reinstall the trust in a political horizon based on the final status issues. Negotiations remain the key to achieve that; they must start now.Leadership is also about trust. To achieve our goals, we need a strong United Nations. I applaud the Secretary-Generals tireless efforts aimed at reforming the internal workings of the Organization. We have elected a Secretary-General to lead, but we must allow him to do so. Intergovernmental micromanagement of what would be the chief executives prerogative in any modern organization is nothing but the opposite of making the United Nations work.To conclude, leaders have real choices. Leaders have real responsibilities. Humankind shapes its own future. Failing to solve the most critical challenges of our time not only harms those who suffer under poverty, war or oppression; it also deprives people of the conviction that they too can shape their own future. And that very conviction, that belief in oneself and each other, is what will make freedom from want, freedom a Security Council to act on our behalf. The permanent members were then entrusted with the right of veto. My countrys delegation at the time was led by Mr. Trygve Lie, who would later become the Organizations first Secretary-General. On behalf of my country, he cast his vote in favour of the right of veto for the five permanent members, as did many other small and medium-sized countries. They did so not only to reflect the world order of the day, but also to ensure that the Council would have genuine authority to make decisions and be able to act on our behalf. They did not do so because they held certain States to be superior to others. Therefore, and in the light of the Syrian drama, my message to the members of the Security Council is that people in the Arab world, in Europe, in Asia, in Africa and in the Americas are watching with horror how history is repeating itself. Once again, the permanent members of the Security Council are divided and unable to protect people on the ground. In its absence, extremists on all sides are free to kill, maim and rape. We now expect the members of the Council to act. We expect them to put away outdated ideas of zero-sum games or spheres of influence and to strive to seek a common position. Enough blood has been shed.The verdict is harsh against those who choose the wrong side of history. They must not allow narrow self-interest to block the winds of change that the vast majority of members of this Assembly applaud. President Al-Assad of Syria was not forced to take the path of conflict and confrontation; he could have opted for compromise and cooperation. Elsewhere in the world, quite different choices are being made.Today in this Assembly, we have heard how Myanmars reformist President Thein Sein is opening the door for a free and democratic Myanmar. I commend the courage shown by the Myanmar Government. I also commend the courage of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. She has chosen to talk to the very people who once held her in confinement.Earlier today in Addis Ababa, the leaders of the Sudan and South Sudan made the choice to end the bloody conflict that has marred their peoples lives for decades. The Sudan and South Sudan had again been on the brink of war, but by signing todays agreements they have opted for peace. We salute the African Union, which has, in close partnership with the Security Council, helped make that choice possible. 31conducted municipal elections in the 1920s and parliamentary elections in the past few decades. Important results have been achieved in providing a greater degree of equality, participation, transparency, political rights and human dignity. That is truly a historical milestone on the path towards building a society based on competitive sustainability, justice, the rule of law, equality and the consecration of the principles of popular participation and representation in the decision-making process.Notwithstanding all those remarkable national achievements, since last year the Kingdom of Bahrain has faced some serious challenges to its security and stability, which it has addressed in full transparency, commitment and honesty. In that context, we established the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry to ascertain the truth and provide redress. Consequently, we launched a comprehensive dialogue among the various sectors of society that resulted in a series of constitutional and legislative reforms encompassing all aspects of life — political, economic, social and legal.Against that backdrop, His Majesty King Hamad bin Issa Al Khalifa of Bahrain proposed the creation of an Arab court of human rights to lay the foundations of an environment conducive to the protection of human rights and the prevention of their abuse in the Arab world, using the model of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the European Court of Human Rights and the African Court on Human and Peoples Rights. The Council of the League of Arab States endorsed that historical initiative, and arrangements are currently under way to establish the legal basis for the courts establishment. We hope that the court will become a reality in the near future.Last week, consistent with our efforts to build a pluralistic Bahraini society and in full respect for the protection and enhancement of human rights, the Kingdom of Bahrain approved more than 90 per cent of the recommendations made by the Human Rights Council in Geneva during its Universal Periodic Review, including a possible accession to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.The challenges and threats facing our region have led the States members of the Gulf Cooperation Council to realize the need for greater synergies among them. They have endorsed the proposal of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz from fear and the freedom to live in dignity possible for all. That is the purpose of our leadership."}}
