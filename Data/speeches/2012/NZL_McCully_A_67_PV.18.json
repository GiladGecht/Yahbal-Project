{"speech":{"0":" I bring greetings from the South Pacific. For the past year, New Zealand has had the privilege of chairing the Pacific Islands Forum, a regional body that represents some of the smallest and most vulnerable States on this planet. For us that has been an important responsibility.Because we are a small country with modest resources, we choose to focus much of our attention on our own region. Over 60 per cent of our official development assistance is spent in our own neighbourhood. Serving as Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum has caused us to reflect on the role of regional organizations, and also on the extent to which we all depend on the United Nations for solutions to challenges that are truly global in character. I say with some confidence that we have been making good progress in dealing with those challenges that are capable of regional solutions. But I must also say that we need and expect more from this institution. The Pacific Islands Forum has 16 members, of which 16 are small island States. I was pleased this week to attend the first meeting between the Secretary-General and Pacific Islands Forum leaders, which I hope will mark a new era of enhanced high-level engagement between this Organization and our region and a greater understanding of our needs.The Pacific has had its share of stability and security challenges in recent times. As a region, we have done reasonably well in dealing with them. Most 21People in my country ask a very simple question: If 25,000 deaths, countless thousands injured and many more displaced and homeless are not enough to get the Security Council to act, then what does it take? Just what does it take? I welcome the leadership that the Arab League and Arab States have shown on this issue, and we have seen similar leadership from them on other difficult issues in their region. And I welcome the fact that the General Assembly has been looking for opportunities to be more engaged. In the absence of leadership from the Security Council, 1 suggest that the Assembly must find ways to play a more activist role.But from all of this, the case for Security Council reform has become utterly compelling. Indeed, increasingly, the future credibility of the United Nations may depend on it. If we are to make progress in this area we will need to see Members move past the extravagant attempts to maximize individual positions and try to find some meaningful, practical reforms that actually hold the prospect of widespread support.I represent a small nation of practical, constructive people. And it is because we seek practical, constructive reform that our Government supports the so-called intermediate solution: the creation of a new category of seat for the group of larger countries that feel underrepresented in comparison with the five permanent members of the Security Council (P-5), but seats that they would have to win in open elections so as to make them fully accountable to the broader membership.I do not intend in these remarks to discuss any other specific proposals we would like to see considered, with one exception. There are now compelling reasons for us to ask the P-5 to voluntarily accept restrictions on the use of the veto. To go further and to seek its abolition is pointless; it simply will not happen. But to ask the P-5 to acknowledge and respect the genuine concerns of the wider membership by voluntarily accepting a curb on the exercise of the veto is an entirely reasonable and achievable objective.My country was one of those that led the opposition to the veto when the Organization was being established; indeed, it was the only Charter issue that was forced to a vote. The permanent members argued at that stage that the veto was necessary in order to protect their vital national interests. Yet today we routinely see the veto exercised in circumstances that have little to do with national interests. My request to the five permanent that the Pacific, overendowed as it is with good sunlight, would by now be positively festooned with solar power plants. Sadly, I must report that that is not in fact the case. Indeed, one of the most striking features of our region has been the complete lack of progress in putting lofty climate change rhetoric into any form of renewable energy practice. In our year in the Chair of the regional body we have set out to correct that serious shortcoming. A small but important illustration lies in our work in the tiny Tokelau Islands. Until now, Tokelau has been 100 per cent dependent on fossil fuels for the generation of electricity. By the end 2012, Tokelau will be over 90 per cent resourced with renewable solar electricity. Good progress has also been made in Tonga, where I recently participated in the opening of a solar power plant supplying around 20 per cent of the electricity requirements of the main island, Tongatapu. And we are working with the Cook Islands Government, too, to assist in meeting their bold aspiration to 50 per cent renewable electricity by 2015, mostly through solar initiatives.These New Zealand-funded programmes are an important part of our overall commitment to our region. Our parting legacy from our year as Chair of the regional body is a renewable-energy pledging conference to be held early next year, with the objective of matching donors, suppliers of concessional and commercial finance, and others with the renewable energy plans of our Pacific neighbours. Here I should acknowledge the European Unions commitment in co-leading this initiative, as well as the support of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Governments of Australia, the United States and other generous supporters.While there is much that can be achieved by regional action, we must acknowledge that sometimes regional solutions are just not enough. That goes right to the very heart of the reason for the existence of this Organization. My point is most vividly illustrated today in relation to Syria. It would be difficult for me to overstate the level of frustration of the people I represent with the complete inability of the Security Council to act in relation to Syria. And it would be even more difficult to overstate the extent to which the Security Council is at risk of losing its credibility in the eyes of reasonable and fair-minded people through its inability to act.22 Zealand believes Iran must be told to step back from a course that risks further dangerous escalation of the situation. We hope the international community will stand firm in sending that sort of message. In return, however, I suggest that it is fair for the international community to make a request of Prime Minister Netanyahu. And that is to put the settlements on hold, at the very least while negotiations proceed, and to engage in the direct talks with his Palestinian counterpart that represent the only basis for a durable solution to this issue, and an essential step in removing the seeds of wider conflict within the region.I would like to remind the Assembly that these are very difficult times for Governments around the world. Budget economies have affected foreign ministries, my own included. It is only fair that we should in turn ask this large institution to find economies and improve working methods in order to deliver better value for our taxpayers. Smaller countries, like New Zealand, depend more than most on good multilateral institutions. We need a United Nations that is modern, efficient and able to meet changing needs. We all need a Security Council that is more responsive to the needs of the wider membership and more effective in dealing with the significant challenges that we all confront today."}}
