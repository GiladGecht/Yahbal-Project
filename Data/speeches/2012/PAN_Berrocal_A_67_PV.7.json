{"speech":{"0":" I congratulate the President on his election to preside over this session of the General Assembly. I respectfully offer him the support of the Panamanian delegation during his tenure. We welcome his proposal to focus this high level debate on the theme “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means”. That theme is based on Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter, which addresses the peaceful settlement of disputes.Since its establishment, the United Nations has played an essential role in the prevention and of the MDGs and other instruments whose tenets advance the human rights of women.We are concerned that sub-Saharan Africa is unlikely to meet the targets for the MDGs. Awareness of that possibility should not make us give up; in the next three years, we must accelerate the implementation of the MDGs. We appeal to all who have made financial commitments to Africa for the achievement of the MDGs not to renege on those commitments. We would like to express our appreciation to those development partners that continue to stick to their 0.7 per cent official development assistance commitment despite their financial difficulties at the domestic level.We support the Secretary-Generals High-level Panel of Eminent Persons to focus on the acceleration of the implementation of the MDGs, and would urge that much of its focus be on assisting Africa in meeting all its targets. However, we wish to caution against prejudging the review outcome and prematurely setting in motion processes that would undermine the ideals of the MDGs.The protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms should be at the centre of our collective desire to resolve international disputes by peaceful means. Racism and racial discrimination continue to be an affront to the very basic founding principles of the United Nations and must be fought relentlessly. We should shun any idea in any part of the world that seems to suggest that there is a superior race or human being on the basis of skin colour. The danger of such ideas is still fresh in our collective memory. We have learned from the evils of colonialism, two World Wars and the system of apartheid. We should all renew our commitment to continue to build on the solid foundation laid by the Durban Declaration and the Plan of Action that we adopted more than a decade ago at the end of the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance.In Durban last December, South Africa had the honour of hosting the seventeenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the seventh session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. Member States must ensure that agreements are implemented. In that regard, the Durban Platform offers an opportunity for progress that we must utilize to move forward.16 resolution of international conflicts. The commitment of the United Nations continues to be to protect future generations from the scourge of war and to ensure that peace and respect among nations are the permanent conditions for global coexistence.International conflicts have always been and will remain a challenge for the international community and a grave threat to freedom and the right to enjoy a peaceful coexistence among all the nations and peoples of the world. That is why all the countries of the world have the responsibility to ensure the maintenance of international peace and security.The Panamanian people possess the strong conviction and the commitment to use all existing peaceful means to solve international conflicts on the basis of the United Nations Charter and international law. Those are simple truths that are easily forgotten, but which we all must defend. They are the basic condition for our existence in full peace, freedom and independence.Panama advocates for the solution of all international conflicts by peaceful means. We support the promotion and defence of multilateralism and of all multilateral organizations as ideal frameworks for solving, through dialogue and cooperation, the problems that aff lict humankind so that we may thereby maintain peace and international peace and security.The search for mediation and dialogue has been the stance that Panama has historically always maintained with regard to the conflicts that disturb peace and international political stability. That search must include legitimate representatives of the parties in conflict, who must make efforts to recognize the rights of their counterparts and comply with their own obligations, with sincerity and a generous spirit, to reach just and permanent solutions.For that reason, the Government of the Republic of Panama considers that Palestine has the right to be recognized as a nation-State. However, it must resolve its differences with its neighbour, Israel, recognizing that Israel has the right to a peaceful and safe existence within its national territory — a right that has already been recognized historically and legally by the international community.Panama expresses its concern at the escalating violence that has been developing in the Middle East and calls upon the international community to propose and attempt to enforce plans and solutions oriented towards peace, contributing to ending violent acts that affect the most vulnerable populations.The Government of the Republic of Panama expresses is concerned about the severe crisis that has affected the fraternal Syrian Arab Republic for over a year. We therefore respectfully remind all parties involved that peaceably resolving conflicts is the only means acceptable to the community of nations and peoples of the world for achieving a just and permanent solution.The Panamanian people deeply deplore the murder of His Excellecy Mr. J. Christopher Stevens, Ambassador of the United States of America to Libya, as well as the Foreign Service personnel who were victims of the nefarious attack against the American Consulate in Benghazi. Our prayers and thoughts are with their families. Panama energetically condemns such actions, which cause sorrow and grief to a friendly nation and which violate the fundamental principles of international law, particularly the Charter of the United Nations and the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations.The recent attacks on the diplomatic missions of the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Israel and France are absolutely unjustifiable. We reiterate that host States have an obligation to ensure the principle of the inviolability of the diplomatic and consular missions of the world and to safeguard international peace and security, as they are the source of communication and understanding. We call loudly and clearly for tolerance, dialogue and peaceful coexistence,The Republic of Panama is convinced that all international conflicts should be settled by peaceful means, using the instruments and mechanisms that have been created for those purposes. For that reason, Panama formally joined the Group of Friends of Mediation, demonstrating its historic commitment to the peaceful solution of conflicts, which is the central topic of this debate at the current session of the General Assembly.As a firm believer that dialogue is a powerful tool for facilitating peace and the international political stability so necessary to ensure economic and social development for our peoples, Panama wishes to reiterate its call, as it has done on other occasions, to support the Chinese people in Taiwan so that they may have greater 17participation as observers in international forums, organizations and initiatives and may cooperate and support the development and maintenance of peace both in Asia and other parts of the world.Panama is a multicultural country where people of diverse ethnicities, cultures and religions coexist in peace and harmony and which has historically maintained friendly relations with States of different political and ideological orientations. I am speaking of a demilitarized country, one that by virtue of its domestic law adheres to the doctrine of human security and that possesses a canal that is neutral. In addition, Panama has tradition and experience as a participant in efforts for the peaceful solution of international controversies. Those conditions are our guarantee and asset in advocating for a world that is peaceful and respectful of international law.Panama continues to be committed to multilateralism, dialogue and negotiation among States as the only way to seek and achieve just solutions in global affairs. As a part of this commitment, in 2013 we will host a series of important international meetings at the global and regional levels.Panama will welcome the International Congress of the Spanish Language, an event of a universal character and a forum for the reflection on the status of the Spanish tongue, which shapes our identity as a nation and unites the peoples of Hispanic America. In 2013, Panama will also host the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption. That demonstrates that the fight against corruption and the promotion of transparency are essential elements of the modern rule of law to which my Government is fully committed.We will also host the fifty-fourth annual meeting of the Board of Governors of the Inter-American Development Bank, at which ministers of economy and finance, central bank presidents and representatives of various multilateral financial institutions will discuss topics related to their financial appointments.In addition, we will host the Americas Competitiveness Forum, which will address the issue of the development of the regions competitiveness agenda on the basis of the 10 general competitiveness principles of the Americas.We will also host the Ibero-American summit, which will bring together the 22 States of Latin America and those of the Iberian peninsula. That summit represents an effort, involving dialogue and cooperation, to foster the development of our countries by opening up new markets and new opportunities for trade and cooperation with the peoples and the countries of Europe.The international meetings set to take place in 2013 will be held in the context of the celebration of a historic event that marks Panamians to this day. I note that today is the anniversary of that event — the discovery of a passage, through our country, to the Pacific Ocean. Today — 25 September — marks almost 500 years since the so-called discovery of the South Sea, later known as the Pacific Ocean, a feat that changed the geography of world navigation and the history of humanity.With the discovery of a passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific, we saw the beginning of a process of economic and demographic globalization around the world. From that moment on, Panama began to play an important role in global navigation and trade that continues today. Since then, Panama has become the primary hub of the Americas. Indeed, it is one of the most important telecommunications and navigation routes in the world.We continue to make good progress in the expansion of the Panama Canal and Tocumen international airport, which will become the largest airport in Latin America. Both of those projects will make it possible to further develop the Panama Canal route and will have a tremendous impact on international trade and on tourism.The feat accomplished by Vasco Nunez de Balboa on 25 September 1513 helped to forge Panamas character as a country dedicated to the global transit of goods, and, with the construction of the Canal, it was consolidated as the hub of worldwide maritime trade.There is no magic formula for the resolution of conflicts. Nor do the global conditions exist for the complete fulfilment of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations, on the peaceful settlement of disputes. The world still has some important steps to take in order to ensure that dialogue is always the means of adjudicating differences. There must be a commitment at the State level for meeting that goal.One of the major steps forward we must take is in the area of education. Education not only sets us free: it makes us free thinkers. It helps us understand 18 in that direction will be key to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.Nevertheless, I remain uneasy about the risks posed by the misuse of cyberspace for boys, girls and adolescents.Our job will not be finished if we do not assume the responsibility of facing up to one of the most significant ethical and moral challenges of our time: the protection of children and young people from the threat posed to them by the misuse of cyberspace.For that reason, we support the initiative promoted by the International Telecommunications Union in that respect. I also invite all States represented here to share their experiences in order to establish and harmonize, on the basis of international telecommunications criteria, norms that will allow us to ensure that minors are no longer exposed to the risks and dangers disseminated through cyberspace. That should in no way be interpreted as a means of limiting or distorting freedom of expression or the universal use of the Internet, which we defend firmly and with great conviction.Panama is preparing draft legislation in order to establish minimum regulations geared towards protecting our children and adolescents from the dangerous content spread through the Internet and other electronic media. We are currently working to pass that legislation based on consensus with all of Panamanian society. We must become allies and close ranks against Internet sites that promote child pornography and pornography in general, obscene and lascivious conduct, and physical, sexual and emotional violence.Let us combine efforts and take concerted action against sites that facilitate the making of weapons or explosives, that incite illegal drug use, and that promote racism, xenophobia or any other type of discrimination that runs contrary to human dignity.Let us take measures against those who dedicate themselves to making public, using and disseminating minors personal information and to making threats of all kinds against our boys, girls and adolescents. Let us harness information and communications technology for the benefit of development and to ensure a better quality of life for our children, and let us not allow the benefits of accessing the Internet to put them at risk.The Government of the Republic of Panama supports the international community and the United and respect different ideas. It provides us with an opportunity to be dreamers. Through education we can learn to value cultures that might seem strange to us; being different does not make us enemies. But in order to understand this in an all-encompassing way, we need a good and objective education.Access to information through the Internet and social networks is an indispensable tool to raise the level of knowledge and discernment among all peoples.While I advocate for the responsible use of those tools, I think that we have to go further. I believe that we must also address the issues of equality and self-esteem, which help distance us from resentment and violence. Once again, education is the answer.Such intangible wealth leads us to honest competition. The substitution of competition for violence can be achieved only through a modernization process in which our principles are preserved. A good education is one that is built upon a foundation of ethics and values. Money is not the best type of assistance we can give our children. The best assistance we can give them is an education that is divorced from politics, passions and paradigms. That is the only way to achieve excellence.We must focus our educational efforts on young children. Good, balanced primary education is the base of a solid pyramid. Educating our children properly today is the best guarantee of a better future for all tomorrow.Without education, there is no possibility of dialogue and vice versa. That is the reason for my Governments focus on the well-being of Panamanian children through the improvement of our schools and classrooms; the creation of a free national Internet network; the provision of free computers; the implementation of a universal scholarship, without any distinction on the basis of class or politics; and, finally, the transformation of our educational curriculum.However, access to information must be provided to children in keeping with their developmental stage, respecting the fact that they are children and requiring that they do the best they can for their age. To respect children is to harvest peace.As I stated at the recent Connect Americas Summit, held in our country in July, we must continue to harness our respective wills to reduce the digital divide and to maximize Internet access around the world. Every step 19Mr. Kanda (Ghana), Vice-President, took the Chair.Finally, Panama reaffirms that it is a country that favours peaceful and respectful coexistence among all the peoples and Governments of the world. We Panamanians believe that humankind will always be capable of fighting for that cause, united by the hope that we can all build a better tomorrow. There is still time to share, as brothers, in the feast of existence on a peaceful planet that truly belongs to all."}}
