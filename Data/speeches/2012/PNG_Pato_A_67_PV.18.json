{"speech":{"0":" Papua New Guinea congratulates Mr. Jeremic on his recent election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. Our country pledges its support to him in that role. I also commend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for the valuable work that he has done in the past year.Papua New Guinea recently celebrated its 37 years of independence, on 16 September. Prior to that, despite various challenges, our country successfully completed its general elections in a fair and peaceful manner. Those elections culminated in the convening of our ninth National Parliament and the formation of a new Government. We thank our close friends and development partners that have assisted us in the election process, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, China, the United States, Great Britain, the European Union, the United Nations and the Commonwealth.As a young developing nation, we are proud of our Constitution-based and evolving democracy. While our people have subsisted on the island nation of Papua New Guinea for many centuries, our short modern history continues to be a testament to the will of our people to maintain and consolidate our burgeoning democracy in line with the rule of law. In todays world, that is the basis on which a just and fair society is built and on which societies have been built.Papua New Guineas key development priorities in the next five years are contained in our Medium-Term Development Plan 2011-2015. That seeks to achieve a 48 is MDG 4. So for our part, our country is taking full ownership of the MDGs.With the support of our development partners such as the European Union and the United Nations, Papua New Guinea is conducting a trial of the Millennium Village concept this month. We recommit ourselves to working with our international partners, including the United Nations, and we reiterate that the MDGs need to be the priority while we discuss sustainable development goals for the long term.Papua New Guinea continues to scale up its efforts to further strengthen human rights protection and advancement in the country. We are working closely with United Nations agencies and our other development partners in the furtherance of these objectives. To date, we have reported to the Human Rights Council on work done relating to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in July 2010. We have also reported to the Human Rights Council under the universal periodic review process. Additionally, the 2012 report of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences (HR) and the 2010 report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment are being considered by our Government this year.Papua New Guinea is committed to gender empowerment and equality. We recognize women and girls as not only key national development partners but also persons whose inherent human dignity must be respected and safeguarded. This is a central pillar of our Constitution and a core value of our national development road map. A testament to the success of this measure is that more girls are enrolling in primary and upper levels of education with an increasingly high retention rate. Women are also increasingly employed, recognized and given greater responsibilities in our public and private sectors. In fact, we achieved a historical milestone this year, and one which is unprecedented in our political history, in that, for the first time, three women were elected to the national parliament. This positive trend is increasing in our country at all levels.We also recognize the critical importance of protecting our women and girls from violence and discrimination. Papua New Guinea is taking a proactive approach through education, advocacy and legislation to prevent gender-based violence. We We believe that a strengthened economy will improve our social indicators, particularly by addressing our literacy levels, high maternal and infant mortality rates, law and order enforcement, the ageing public sector workforce and the declining state of our countrys infrastructure.Papua New Guinea supports the Secretary-Generals five-year action agenda on sustainable development, enhanced human security, enhancing the core values of the international community, supporting nations in transition, and working with and for women and young people, which was launched on 25 January. Papua New Guinea continues to benefit from a strong United Nations presence, through which various development programmes have been implemented. We highly value the contribution of the United Nations in that regard. We have also been implementing the One United Nations initiative since 2006 as a self-starter country. So far, that is working exceptionally well for our country. We are also grateful that the United Nations has heeded our call and has synergized its development assistance framework 2012-2015 with our Medium-Term Development Plan. However, we can do more. We urge donor partners to abide by the principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action. Through the Pacific Islands Forum, we have adapted the Cairns Compact in order to better coordinate development assistance and to ensure the effective delivery of aid.We welcome the proactive engagement of the United Nations with the Pacific region and thank the Secretary-General for his visit and ongoing commitment. We are encouraged by that and by the fact that contacts with the United Nations system and personnel will be strengthened in the Pacific Islands region.The challenge for Papua New Guinea is to ensure that the development of our natural resources is sustainable and that the benefits are effectively translated into the improved livelihoods of our people. That, in turn, will assist us in meeting our Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), especially the 22 indicators and 90 national targets that we have set ourselves. We acknowledge that it will be a challenge to attain all the MDGs by 2015, but note there has been measured progress in the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, which is MDG 1, and the reduction of child mortality, which 49ratify the Rarotonga Treaty, which prohibits nuclear weapons in the region, to do so.We remain concerned about the continued proliferation of small arms and light weapons. In this context, we call for the recent impasse on the negotiations on a global arms trade treaty to be ended as soon as possible.Papua New Guinea supports the Group of Seven Plus forum for its efforts to strengthen peacebuilding and State-building in fragile and post-conflict countries and commend Timor-Leste for their leadership. As part of our national commitment to fostering global peace and security, Papua New Guinea has commenced its contribution to the United Nations peacekeeping force and is looking to expand that contribution.We remain committed to the United Nations sustainable development agenda, especially on climate change, with respect to mitigation and adaptation. We are committed to working closely with the global community under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and subscribe to the Rio+20 outcome declaration, “The future we want” (resolution , annex).Papua New Guinea recognizes the pivotal role of the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) for sustainable development. As a founding member of GGGI, Papua New Guinea pledges to work together with other stakeholders to ensure the desired outcomes through the Institute. In this context, we pay tribute to the work that has been done by the Republic of Korea.In conclusion, we support the call made by the Secretary-General for the reform of the United Nations system. We also again call for the reform of the Security Council in both the permanent and the non-permanent categories of members, in order for it to reflect the geopolitical realities of today"}}
