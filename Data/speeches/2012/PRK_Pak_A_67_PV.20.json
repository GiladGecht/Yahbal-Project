{"speech":{"0":" Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I expect your proficient stewardship will guide the Assembly to success.At the outset, I would like to express our profound gratitude to the heads of State and Government and peoples of the States Members of the United Nations, the Secretary-General, the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, representatives of United Nations bodies and of many countries for deep condolences they extended to us at the demise in December last year of the great leader of our people, Kim Jong Il. General Kim Jong Il devoted tireless efforts until the last moment of his life to firmly safeguarding the dignity and sovereignty of our country and the prosperity and happiness of its people, as well as to accomplishing the cause of global independence and world peace and stability. Today, having hailed dear respected Marshal Kim Jong Un as the Supreme Leader of the Party, State and Army, our people are striving to build a prosperous and powerful socialist State. Dear respected Marshal Kim Jong Un safeguards the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula by carrying forward the Songun policy of General Kim Jong Il in good faith. He wisely leads the general advance march for developing our economy, improving peoples livelihood, and devising a development strategy of our own style and innovative methods with his insight into the world.Sustainable peace will not be possible without each and every one of us engaging in a constructive dialogue directed toward achieving dignified and decent living conditions for all human beings. That can be done only through a shared belief with regard to fundamental values that guarantee respect for human life. In that regard, respect for religious freedom is essential, within national public life as well as internationally. Reason tells us that each person has transcendental dignity, which brings with it freedom to determine ones own ultimate destiny and which national and international authorities, as well as social mechanisms, must fully respect. That is why actions by Governments and international organizations must necessarily strive to promote comprehensive human development, creating legal, economic and social conditions that genuinely reflect the importance of human dignity and its transcendental dimension, both at the personal level and collectively. Religion should not be thought of other than as a factor of peace and progress, a living force for the well-being of all. Indeed, it leads human beings to overcome every egotistical interest and to devote their energies to the service of others, including for peace among peoples. That is why all forms of fanaticism and exclusivism and all acts of violence towards ones neighbour are an exploitation of and a deviation from religion. Moreover, history has shown that a biased concept of secularism, or tolerance that would limit religious matters to the private sphere, can only undermine the bases for peaceful coexistence, at both the national and international levels. The Holy See has been involved in international cooperation activities since they were first given institutional structure. We established our Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York in 1964. The reason for its presence as a subject of international law in this intergovernmental institution is first of all its desire to offer to the international community a transcendent view of life and social relations, recalling in particular the dignity of the individual and his fundamental rights, in the first place the right to religious freedom. The international community has always welcomed this contribution, which allows common initiatives to put back into a profound perspective, in which the underlying unity of the human family and the call to the generosity of individuals and peoples must always be reaffirmed.22 integrity of Syria and the right to self-determination and existence of Palestine should be rejected.Democratizing the United Nations and, in particular, strengthening the authority of the General Assembly are urgent issues for enhancing the central role of the United Nations in international relations. The Assembly resolution adopted long ago on dismantling the so-called United Nations Command stationed in South Korea and the resolution adopted annually on ending the United States blockade against Cuba remain unimplemented. These are typical examples that show the need to strengthen the authority of the General Assembly.It is quite natural for the General Assembly, which represents the general will of all Member States, to supervise the overall activities of the Organization. In particular, it should be given the authority to undertake final review of Security Council resolutions related to peace and security, such as sanctions and use of force. The abuse of the Security Council as a tool for pursuing strategic interests by a handful of countries should never be overlooked. Last April, the United States took issue with our legitimate and peaceful space launch, which followed universal international law, and forced the Council to adopt an unjust statement. That alone shows how the Council has been abused.Security Council reform, which is at the core of overall United Nations reform, is a matter that should no longer be delayed. It should be carried out in a manner that guarantees responsibility, transparency, impartiality and objectivity in its activities and ensures full representation of developing countries in its composition.Other United Nations bodies in which double standards and the theory of force are extremely evident are the Third Committee of the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. Politicization, selectivity and double standards in deliberations on human rights should be put to an end. We should never allow the continuation of the practice whereby human rights situations of selected countries are either called into question or simply ignored in accordance with the political purposes and interests of the West and the Western standard values.In the field of sustainable development, which is now one of the three targets set by the United Nations, the agreement reached in the United Nations Our dear respected Marshal Kim Jong Un is firmly determined to make our people, who have overcome manifold hardships, enjoy a happy life to their hearts content in a prosperous socialist State. Dear respected Marshal Kim Jong Un is implementing independent foreign policy and opening up a new chapter in the development of relations with other countries that are friendly to the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, not bound by the past. Our people are following dear respected Marshal Kim Jong Un with absolute trust in him and are vigorously advancing to the final victory with full conviction in and optimism about the future, single-heartedly united behind him.The founding of the United Nations in the last century gave hope to mankind following a tragic world war — hope of achieving common prosperity by ensuring peace and security and developing cooperation among States based on the principle of sovereign equality. Yet today, after the first decade of the new century, that desire of the mankind has yet to be achieved. At present in international relations, high-handedness and arbitrariness are becoming ever more undisguised, and the use of force and acts of State terrorism aimed at infringing on sovereignty, interference in internal affairs and effecting regime change are being perpetrated under such pretexts as non-proliferation and humanitarian intervention.We are now witnessing the resurrection of the outdated international relations of the first half of the twentieth century, when a handful of great Powers dominated the world by resorting to the use of force. This resurrection tarnishes the credibility of the United Nations, whose mandate is to ensure global peace and security.The fact that the theme “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means” was chosen for the current session shows the seriousness of the current international situation. The most serious issue in the international arena at present is a f lagrant violation of the principles of respect for sovereignty and equality. Unless the high-handedness and arbitrariness of certain countries are thoroughly eliminated, it will be hard to say that the United Nations is fulfilling its role and function as a centre for coordinating cooperative relations between States based on the principle of sovereign equality as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The unjustifiable interference, pressure and use of force that violate the sovereignty and territorial 23of Korea that have prevented the continued military provocations of the United States from turning into all-out war on the Korean peninsula. However, this does not mean that the patience of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea is inexhaustible. Our people value peace and stability in pursuing their overall goal of building a prosperous and powerful State. But the dignity of our nation and the sovereignty of our country are even more valuable.Our principled stand is based on reacting to an aggressors reckless provocations with an immediate, corresponding strike in defence of our nations dignity and sovereignty, and to respond to a war of aggression with a just war of reunification of the country. The realities of the situation on the Korean peninsula prove that we have been absolutely right to have built a military deterrent capacity for our self-defence, by tightening our belts in order to pursue the path of Songun and independence. Our military deterrent is a mighty weapon that defends the countrys sovereignty and a powerful means of preventing war on the Korean peninsula, as well as a strong guarantee that enables us to focus our efforts on economic construction and improving peoples livelihoods.The only way to prevent war and ensure lasting peace on the Korean peninsula is to put an end to the hostile policy of the United States towards the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. That policy is the root cause that has made the Korean peninsula the worlds most dangerous hotspot, and it is the chief obstacle to lasting peace and security. The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is also a product of that policy. None of these problems, including the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, can be resolved without first ending the hostile policy of the United States, which views the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea as an enemy target and tries to stif le it at any cost. That is the essence of the process of our dialogue with the United States and a lesson we have drawn from practical experience.Since the turn of the new century, North-South summit meetings have been held twice, amid the joyful enthusiasm of all our fellow countrymen. They resulted in the adoption of the 15 June North-South Joint Declaration and the 4 October Declaration, and created an atmosphere in which the desire for reconciliation, cooperation and reunification between North and South reached a peak. Soon after taking office, however, the new South Korean authorities annulled all inter-Korean Conference on Sustainable Development, held last June in Rio de Janeiro, should be implemented. Practical measures should be taken to solve such issues as establishing fair international economic and trade relations, fulfilling official development assistance commitments, transferring environmentally clean technologies to developing countries and strengthening financial support.Today, due to the ongoing hostile policy of the United States towards the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, a vicious cycle of confrontation and aggravation of tension continues to aff lict the Korean peninsula, which has become the worlds most dangerous hotspot, a place where a spark could set off a thermonuclear war. At the root of that hostile policy, which has lasted for more than half a century, towards the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea lies the intention of the United States to destroy the ideas and system our people have chosen and to occupy the entire Korean peninsula, in order to use it as a stepping stone in realizing its strategy of dominating all of Asia.Since the day the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea was founded, the United States has designated it an enemy and refused to recognize its sovereignty. Since then, it has pursued every kind of sanction, pressure and military provocation against the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea for more than half a century. Its hostile policy is most deeply rooted in the military field. No precedent can be found in modern history for the situation whereby the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea and the United States have continued as warring parties after hostilities ended and for more than 60 years altogether.With a view to eliminating the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea by force, the United States has already finalized various war scenarios, and is waiting for a chance to implement them, as it has outlined in a contingency plan to impose military rule after a military invasion. In accordance with those plans for military operations, the United States has staged various joint military exercises under different names in and around the Korean peninsula for several decades. A typical example was a combined military exercise named Ulji Freedom Guardian, staged at the end of last August and involving huge numbers of armed forces, which pushed the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war.It is only the patience and military deterrent self-defence capacity of the Democratic Peoples Republic 24 humanism, multilateralism and the equality of States before the law. Since then, the great majority of countries have fought to see those principles complied with, but there have also been countries whose power has wrongfully enabled them to fail to live up to the principles and to their obligations within the system.The world has changed substantially since the road map for the United Nations was designed, and its functions must adapt to the new demands of international relations, characterized by exchanges of information and communications and by interdependent economies. We believe the time has come to end the illegitimate political exploitation of United Nations bodies by certain Powers, which continue to exert political and economic pressure and even to intervene militarily in sovereign States whose Governments criticize the international status quo or focus on different ideologies from those promoted by some Powers, or whose public policies are opposed to the economic interests of large transnational companies. Such pressure delegitimizes the system and distorts multilateralism itself.In the five years of President Rafael Correas Government, Ecuador has regained sovereignty in decision-making on its internal and international policies, pursuing decisions that promote a horizontal relationship between countries with the same rights and obligations. In those five years Ecuador has supported peace. That is why we have expressed our concern about the terrible consequences for human beings that result from military interventions conducted by the Powers, and why we are calling loudly for dialogue and for respect for human rights and the peoples self-determination in all countries in conflict. We have had enough of geopolitical visions that are imposed by force, destroying human rights. In that regard, Ecuador welcomes with great hope and enthusiasm the dialogue process in the sister Republic of Colombia, which is the bravest step that the Government of that fraternal country could have taken.Today the world is experiencing constant changes in the distribution of power. New regional Powers have emerged in the past 20 years and have begun to play a decisive role in international politics and security. Russia, China, India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Argentina, Indonesia, Venezuela and the developing world, in general, are now the drivers of the global economy. It is therefore a political imperative that multilateralism be strengthened and promoted with regard to respect and equality among States. agreements, including the 15 June North-South Joint Declaration and the 4 October Declaration, which had been warmly welcomed and were fully supported by the entire Korean nation and the international community, including the United Nations. Furthermore, the confrontation between fellow countrymen and systems have caused an extreme deterioration in inter-Korean relations. The South Korean authorities rubbed salt in the wounds of our people, who had suffered such a huge national loss, even insulting our supreme dignity with acts of political terrorism, and leaving inter-Korean relations totally bankrupt. History will bring them to justice.The Government of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea will join hands with anyone who truly desires the countrys reunification and national reconciliation and prosperity. With responsibility and patience, and relying on the nations concerted efforts, it is making every effort to realize the historic cause of national reunification by preventing interference by outside forces and any attempt by anti-reunification forces to achieve permanent national division.The Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea will continue to further strengthen and develop the relations of friendship and cooperation with all countries that respect its sovereignty, pursuant to the principles of independence, peace and friendship on which its foreign policy is based, and will actively cooperate with the efforts of United Nations Member States to secure world peace and stability and to achieve sustainable development."}}
