{"speech":{"0":" At the outset I would like to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremic on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session and to wish him all success.I would also like to express my thanks to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of the General Assembly at its previous session and one of the most capable Qatari diplomats, for his efforts to ensure the successful work of the General Assembly. 29The situation in Syria has reached an unacceptable phase. Hundreds of innocent Syrians are killed every day, under the fire of a regime that does not hesitate to use all sorts of weapons against its own people. We have used all available means to help Syria extricate itself from the cycle of killing, but in vain. The Security Council has failed to reach an effective position. In view of that, I believe that the Arab countries themselves should intervene, in order to fulfil their national humanitarian, political and military duties, and do what is necessary to stop the bloodshed in Syria, the killing of innocent people and their displacement and guarantee a peaceful transition of power. We do have a precedent in that respect. Arab forces intervened in Lebanon in the mid-1970s to stop the internal fighting there, and their efforts proved effective and useful. We urge all countries that believe in the cause of the Syrian people to provide every type of support to that people until they are able to secure their legitimate rights.Despite all the suffering in the Middle East, the core problem remains the Palestinian question: the continued Israeli occupation of the Arab territories in the West Bank, the Golan and Shabaa farms in southern Lebanon, the stif ling blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip and the continued arrest and imprisonment of thousands of Palestinians in Israeli prisons. The peace process has stalled because of the current Israeli position that insists on continuing the policy of settlements in the Palestinian territories and Jerusalem and refusing to cede them.Sometimes I would like to ask why the international community does nothing to implement the relevant resolutions on the Middle East. Why does the Security Council not adopt a resolution under Chapter VII that would force Israel to lift the blockade of Gaza and stop its settlement activity, a resolution that would return the peace process to the comprehensive track instead of the piecemeal approach, which does not lead to results? I find no answer to my questions.We firmly believe in the importance of the freedom of expression and the right of people to express their opinion based on our belief in the sanctity of humanity and the dignity of man, who was created by God as free and dignified. At the same time, we believe that freedom should not exceed reasonable limits and become a tool to hurt and insult the dignity of others or ther dignity of religions, faiths and sacred beliefs. This shows that peoples have sacrificed their lives and wealth to gain freedom. In the same way, dictatorships do not change at the first signs of revolution but require real resistance to depose them. The desire for advancement will not eliminate backwardness except through hard work. Occupied territories will never be restored by a mere rejection of the occupation, but by persistence in demanding rights and by resistance using all legitimate means.What adds to the difficulties of the transition in our Arab world is that it takes place in a time of great aspirations and a climate subject to all sorts of changes and complications. Our peoples have had to fight to change their lives under circumstances that differ greatly from those faced by others in similar situations. In America, Europe, Asia and other places, historical transitions have taken place within certain limits. In the Arab world, however, that birth has had to take place under spotlights, before the eyes of the entire world, under the watchful eye of satellites crisscrossing space and shaped by electronic media, without any shield or barrier of any sort.In order to achieve their objectives, those who undertake internal and external interventions to peoples from attaining their legitimate rights do not hesitate to use all means at their disposal, from exploitation of the past and its complex legacy to other means of provocation. They can even use arms, shedding seas of blood, if other means fail or take too long. All of that has made our transition from past to future and from backwardness to development a risky process, under fire from all corners.Together with others, we realized the risks inherent in the current phase of the evolution of our nation and of the Arab world. If we could ask for one thing during this session, it would be an encouraging reconfirmation of the right of our Arab world to continue its advancement and achieve its aspirations in a new world, a world shaped by science and technology, a world that the pioneers who wrote the well-known conventions on rights and freedom could not have imagined.On the other hand, I hope that this world gathering will take a stand that reflects sympathy with the historic transformations under way in the Arab world. That would reassure the people who are working hard and with determination to carve out a place for themselves in history and who struggle to achieve freedom and dignity, hoping for a better tomorrow for future generations.30 Before concluding, I would like to welcome the election of our brother Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as President of the Somali Republic, and to wish him every success in achieving security and stability in that country, whose people have suffered so much. I call on the international community to exert greater effort to help Somalia to reach a solution to its crisis that is acceptable to all the Somali parties, one that will pave the way for the return of peace to the country and will help rebuild the State after the long years of war and destruction."}}
