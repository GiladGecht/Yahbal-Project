{"speech":{"0":" The current session of the General Assembly gives us a complete picture of todays world with all its challenges and opportunities. We can also glimpse various paths opening up before us to help us meet the needs of humankind and of nations. I would like to focus on the three main areas of activity of the United Nations — peace and security; development; and human rights, democracy and the rule of law. In our approach we believe that the realities of the last decade have confirmed the profound and complex interdependence that exists between these areas. There is no peace and security without development and respect for human rights and democracy. Development is a catalyst for democracy and respect for human rights, and, at the same time, an essential factor for peace and security. In their turn, respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law strengthen development and create the conditions for lasting peace and security.(spoke in English)New situations of internal instability, civil strife and insecurity, with spillover effects, have arisen in the Middle East and other regions. It is regrettable that the new session of the Assembly is beginning in the shadow of the sorrow over the recent events in Benghazi. Attacks on diplomatic representatives are unacceptable for any reason. Diplomats are bridges between cultures, links among nations. Their inviolability is part of ancient custom. I strongly condemn the attacks and offer my sincere condolences to the families of the victims. The perpetrators must be brought to justice through a fair and equitable trial. At the same time, the ideals of democracy must be preserved. Stability and the rule of law should be the future pillars of society in Libya and elsewhere. We are firmly committed to supporting the efforts of the international community to consolidate stability and security, tolerance and religious understanding.Throughout 2012 we have been confronted with the dire effects of the crisis in Syria, where human rights violations are now rampant. The Syrian Government 28 within the United Nations. One area where we could find solutions within the United Nations framework is improving the functioning of the banking and financial systems and institutions. National and international banking and financial institutions should become ever greater partners for Governments — a part of the solution to the economic crises confronting countries and regions.Young people are the future of our nations and of our world. The United Nations has, in the past, takem up the problems facing younger generations, including through programmes of action adopted by the General Assembly. The time has come to revisit this area of interest to assess the achievements as well as the steps to be taken in order to meet the current expectations and needs of youth.We should reconsider from a broader perspective the vital role of the education sector in providing support, especially but not exclusively, to young people. Such support should include universal access for younger generations to education; professional training allowing rapid and efficient integration into the labour market; and participation in, and contribution to, the shaping of future societies in all the countries, especially in those in transition.For many years now, water has been a major concern as climate change affects its availability in all regions. Water, our planets most precious resource, must not be allowed to become our most disputed resource and a source of bitter conflict.Our attention should be focused on the follow-up to and implementation of the decisions recently adopted by the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. Relevant resolutions on enhancement of the institutional framework for sustainable development, agreement on sustainable development goals, and determination of certain financial aspects of the achievement of those goals are expected by all of us.(spoke in French)I should like to share some thoughts relating to the area of human rights, which is of growing relevance for our cooperation in the framework of the United Nations. International cooperation and discussions promoting human rights received renewed momentum with the establishment of the Human Rights Council. As an elected member of the Council since it began its work, Romania has contributed to the development must all keep our attention focused on these unsettled situations. Meanwhile, we express our satisfaction with the efforts carried out over the past 12 months by the special representatives of the United Nations, the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.Over the past year, the Security Council reacted promptly to new crises by adopting resolutions aimed at preventing the escalation of conflict or calling for the re-establishment of constitutional order or for efforts by all the parties involved to find negotiated solutions to new problems. The resolutions adopted have not always met expectations. In spite of the fact that the mandates of several United Nations peacekeeping missions were extended, little progress was made.Under the auspices of the United Nations, through a joint innovative and intellectual effort, the conceptual approach has been enlarged to include human security, the responsibility to protect, and mediation. There is still a long way to go before those concepts are operational. When the time comes, Romania stands ready to implement them.New categories of participants must be included in our common endeavour. Beside Governments, non-governmental organizations, civil society, parliaments and local communities are already acting to identify optimal solutions. Based on my previous experience as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate, I consider that the role of parliaments as elected bodies could be increased in prevention activities or in efforts to settle existing conflicts. In that respect, cooperation and interaction between the United Nations, national parliaments and the Inter-Parliamentary Union in peacebuilding efforts is highly relevant.Over the past 15 years, my country has taken a keen interest in, and offered important contributions to, civilian and military missions under United Nations mandates. Today Romania is honoured and proud to have contributed in a consistent way to various United Nations operations. I pay my deepest respect to the men and women of Romania who have lost or risked their lives in conflict areas, as well as to all the military, police, gendarmes and civilian personnel serving all over the world to bring peace and security under the f lag of the United Nations.As I have already mentioned, development is equally a major area of interest, action and cooperation 29the Ivorian delegation for the success of his mandate. I would also like to convey to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, my delegations satisfaction with the work undertaken and the encouraging results achieved under his presidency. His commitment to our common cause has allowed the Organization to fully play the role conferred upon it by the United Nations Charter. I wish to reiterate to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon my sincere thanks for his determined commitment and for his persistent quest for peace throughout the world. I reiterate to him once again the infinite gratitude of my President and the entire nation for his unfailing commitment to Cote dIvoire. Through the Secretary-General, I would like to pay tribute to all the civil and military personnel of the United Nations for their tireless efforts on behalf of peace and security.The theme chosen for this session, “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means”, follows on from the theme of the previous session. In particular, it ref lects the essence of the ideals of the San Francisco Conference, which led to the birth of the Organization. The purposes ascribed to the United Nations in its Charter can be summarized by the triptych of peace, liberty and development. To achieve those Charter purposes, the founding fathers of the Organization established a system of collective security on the basis of two major principles: the prohibition of recourse to the use of force in international relations and the obligation to settle disputes peacefully.Now more than ever, we must enhance our collective security system and ensure that it has all the necessary resources to be effective. For his part, the President of Cote dIvoire is committed to strictly following a policy of peace and dialogue. These are principles that were enshrined as cardinal virtues, through trial by fire, by the late President, Mr. Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who won a place in the history of Cote dIvoire, and indeed of the African continent, through his pragmatic approach to the settlement of conflict through dialogue. For that reason, President Allassane Ouattara spares no efforts in seeking lasting solutions, both nationally in the post-electoral crisis in Cote dIvoire, and regionally, especially with regard to the situations in Mali and Guinea-Bissau. Indeed, the security of West Africa is seriously challenged by military and political crises orchestrated by military, rebel or terrorist movements, particularly in Mali and Guinea-Bissau. and adoption of its working methods, based on a more analytical approach as well as on in-depth cooperation and interactive dialogue with Member States. The main objective of the Romanian presidency of the Human Rights Council in 2007 was to strengthen and more actively promote human rights at the global level. We believe that the universal periodic review is an appropriate instrument for implementing the international protection of human rights in all its aspects. It can also respond to new human rights challenges, such as those posed by the Internet.This spring in Geneva, Romania, together with Morocco, Norway, Peru, Qatar and Tunisia, promoted a draft resolution entitled “Human rights, democracy and the rule of law”, which was sponsored by 124 countries from all regional groups. The broad support for the resolution, and the large number of Member States that supported its adoption by the Council, confirms the interest of Member States in this subject. We saw a broad recognition of the close interlinkage of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. We would like to see in the near future the same approach taken by the General Assembly in the form of a similar resolution. In that respect, Romania is ready to set to work and to act together with other interested Member States.In conclusion, I would like to reaffirm my countrys commitment to the principles and values promoted and constantly enhanced by the United Nations. We recognize that there is no alternative to the framework of cooperation offered by the United Nations system, which aims to resolve the complex and interrelated problems of our day. Reforming and adapting the system to the new realities of the world depends entirely upon us as Member States. It depends on our political will as political leaders. By doing so, we will meet the expectations of our peoples."}}
