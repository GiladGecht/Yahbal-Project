{"speech":{"0":" For over a year and a half, the situation in the Middle East and North Africa has been the nerve centre of global politics. The deep changes that have swept over the region intertwine with the key problems of modern international relations and require everyone to take a comprehensive approach and to reject simplistic and ideology-driven patterns and double standards.Russia has consistently supported peoples in their aspiration to determine their destiny and to pave the way to more effective models of public governance. We believe it is particularly important to carry out those transformations in a non-violent way and without outside interference. We strongly believe that all members of the international community should be interested in making the Middle East-North Africa region peaceful, stable, democratic and free from domestic and inter-State conflicts. So far, however, there has been no progress in reaching unanimity in the efforts of outside players to create conditions for achieving that goal.Of particular concern is the deepening internal conflict in Syria. We have consistently called for consolidated efforts by the international community to compel the Government and its opponents to immediately cease the violence, come to the negotiating table and work out a compromise on the content and pace of reforms that would satisfy all Syrians and ensure the safety and rights of all ethnic and religious groups. That was the substance of the consensus recorded in the final communique of the Action Group for Syria (, annex), agreed upon in Geneva as a follow-up to the Kofi Annan plan.We call upon all members of the Action Group to fully abide by the commitments we all took on in Geneva. That is the fastest way to stop the loss of human life in Syria. We proposed a Security Council resolution endorsing the Geneva communique as the basis for negotiations at the beginning of the transitional period, Furthermore, in times of crisis, we can see that we run the risk of not reaching all of the Millennium Development Goals that we proposed to reach by 2015. We cannot allow that to happen. The commitments of the developed countries to allocate 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance must be honoured. Another grave problem is that of food insecurity. The food crisis is a serious obstacle in the struggle against poverty and hunger. We must work together to universally restore that right to the peoples. Our societies are struggling with the urgency of satisfying their most basic needs, with equitable profits from the benefits of development and with the importance of developing democracies based on representation and direct participation of the citizens. That is a road whose specificities must be respected without interference of any kind. Dangers lurk and have resulted in events that do not contribute to our political stability. Coups detat, such as those attempted in Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador or those carried out in Honduras and Paraguay, must be condemned and rejected, regardless of how they are executed or attempted. We cannot allow coups to once again become entrenched as methods for a political solution to conflicts, whether within any country or between States.We cannot ignore that the process of concentration of global power has repercussions in the political and social systems governing our societies. The final blow is intended to destroy or break up popular social movements in order to eliminate States and Governments that do not align themselves with the neoliberal model. Therefore, in the progressive or revolutionary national projects manifested through the nation States of our Latin and Caribbean America, our citizens, our peoples, are called to resist and to raise banners of peace, dignity, identity and national sovereignty.We are constructing a new world governance with our work to transform international institutions. We are strengthening a new world governance by incorporating more and more citizens in the work of building this new world to which we aspire. The present global order and its institutions are at an impasse. The only headway being made is through the new effort I am describing to deeply transform the economy, politics, society and culture. That effort alone will endure as the fruit of the 21among themselves. In that matter, the League of Arab States should play an important role.On the whole, we support closer ties between the United Nations and regional entities. I would note that in our part of the world today a memorandum on cooperation was signed between the secretariat of the Collective Security Treaty Organization and the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations. I am convinced that it will increase the efficiency of common efforts to ensure stability and security.All our actions should be founded solidly on the United Nations Charter, which makes no provision for the right to change regimes. It is unacceptable to impose a political system on a country and its people. Our position was clearly stated by President Vladimir Putin speaking at the Kremlin on 26 September. The entire sequence of events in the Arab world and other regions proves the futility of any such policy, which can lead to dangerous interethnic and interreligious clashes in international relations. We believe it is an obligation of all States to protect from provocations and blasphemy the religious feelings of people of any religious affiliation. At the same time, of course, there can be no justification for acts of terror, regardless of where they are committed, be they in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Yemen or anywhere else. Attacks against diplomats or United Nations personnel are absolutely unacceptable.In general, we are convinced that today, when the world is going through a transition period characterized by instability in the spheres of the economy, politics and inter-civilizational relations, it is particularly important for United Nations Member States to be able to rely on accepted rules of conduct and to agree on a joint response to the threats to global stability. We should not allow irresponsible actions dictated by expedient interests to shatter the system of international law. The world order is threatened by arbitrary interpretation of such essential principles as the non-use or threat of force, the peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and non-interference in their domestic affairs.Those are the key principles of the United Nations Charter, which confers the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security on the Security Council. In advancing the reform of the United Nations, it is essential to preserve the capacity of the Security Council to perform those functions. Their but that proposal was blocked. Those who oppose the implementation of the Geneva communique bear an onerous responsibility. They insist on a ceasefire by the Government alone and encourage the opposition to intensify hostilities, in fact pushing Syria even deeper into the abyss of bloody internecine strife. The militarization of the conflict continues, with calls for open intervention. Extremist organizations including Al-Qaida have become more active in Syria. They perpetrate terrorist attacks against innocent civilians and civil infrastructure. The number of war crimes is growing, on the part of both Government forces and the opposition, as recorded in the recent report of the Human Rights Councils commission of inquiry (HR).Russia resolutely condemns any violence, wherever it comes from, and is convinced that there is still an opportunity to undertake collective action. Practical steps to overcome the crisis need to begin with a comprehensive ceasefire, the release of prisoners and hostages and the provision of additional humanitarian aid. That would create the conditions to start an inter-Syrian dialogue. We hope that Lakhdar Brahimi, Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States, will be able to bring his vast experience to bear on moving towards an agreement on such arrangements, with the support of the international community. Russia will provide its full support to promote the success of his mission.The changes taking place in the Middle East should not marginalize the Palestinian problem. The achievement of a comprehensive, just and lasting Arab-Israeli settlement, which should lead, among other results, to the establishment of an independent, viable and contiguous Palestinian State, coexisting in peace and security with Israel, would be a major contribution to the normalization of the overall regional situation. The Arab Peace Initiative fully retains its relevance, and we support the efforts of the League of Arab States to move it forward.I also wish to stress the importance of implementing the decision on convening in 2012 a conference on establishing in the Middle East a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery (see NPCON (Vol.I)). It is clearly necessary to ensure the participation in the conference of all States in the region, and they should agree on key arrangements 22 All of this is related to the debate regarding the concept of the so-called responsibility to protect. Further discussion of this concept should be held on the basis of the approach agreed on at the 2005 World Summit, which reaffirmed the need to observe the principles of the Charter of the United Nations when responding to conflicts within States. The protection of civilians is an issue far too serious to be exploited to achieve political goals. The ambiguity of the so-called responsibility-to-protect concept can be better understood in light of initiatives formulated by Brazil and several other States to move towards consensus.Let us not forget that the founders of the United Nations, in their wisdom, agreed upon and endorsed a Charter that enshrined principles for the regulation of a multipolar world order. Now that the abnormal bipolar period of the Cold War is over, and now that it has become clear to all that there is no place for monopolarity in the modern world and international affairs can only be polycentric, we have a unique chance to fully implement the original potential of that Charter.This is a difficult challenge. International relations are clearly experiencing a lack of credibility. We regard this as the main obstacle to practical progress towards the establishment of universal foundations for equal and indivisible security, whether in the Euro-Atlantic area, Asia-Pacific region or other parts of the world. Such a state of affairs clearly contradicts the concept of collective security embodied in the Charter and the deep interdependence of the modern world, where most challenges and threats are common to us all and have a cross-border dimension.Strengthening confidence and collective principles in international affairs, with the emphasis on negotiating the pursuit of compromise solutions, would help substantially reduce the level of instability and move forward in the settlement of crisis situations, not only in the Middle East, but also with respect to Iran, Afghanistan, the Korean peninsula and other situations throughout the world.The final goal of the efforts to settle a conflict is to ensure the right to life and other fundamental human rights, be they political, economic or social. The events of recent years confirm that, without lasting peace and sustainable development, it is impossible to ensure human rights. In turn, the protection of human rights should contribute to security and development, rather erosion would deprive the international community of an essential mechanism for developing joint approaches to the settlement of crisis situations.It is appropriate to mention the compulsory instruments at the disposal of the United Nations. Under the United Nations Charter the imposition of sanctions falls exclusively under the jurisdiction of the Security Council. Decisions must be made on a collegial basis, with the understanding that sanctions should not lead to isolation of the State targeted for sanctions, but rather encourage it to engage in a dialogue to remove questions that the Member States may have. It is essential that sanctions should be well-measured and that they not cause any suffering to the population. In the past the Security Council has discussed the issue of the humanitarian limits of sanctions, but somehow the discussions have faded away. We believe it is important to resume them.Another issue that needs to be discussed in the Security Council is the consequences of unilateral sanctions imposed by a State or a group of States sidestepping the United Nations to advance their political goals. We have no doubt that such sanctions, especially when they are applied extraterritorially, weaken the unity of the international community and undermine the effectiveness of its efforts. For many years, the commercial, economic and financial restrictions imposed by the United States on Cuba have remained an illustration of the negative impact of unilateral sanctions. Russia, together with the overwhelming majority of members of the international community, calls for the swift lifting of the blockade, which is a relic of the Cold War.Special attention should be given to the practical enforcement of Security Council decisions regarding sanctions against non-State actors and illegal cross-border formations. In general, the events of recent years have clearly shown that unilateral action which violates international law and circumvents or distorts the decisions of the Security Council does no good.Of course, the legal norms of international affairs will be further adjusted as necessary. But these transformations should be treated with the greatest sense of responsibility and full consciousness of the serious risks involved. Consensus should be the sole route to their adoption. Violations of international law should not be portrayed as some sort of creative development. 23"}}
