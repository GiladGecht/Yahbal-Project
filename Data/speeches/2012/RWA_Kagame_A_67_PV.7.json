{"speech":{"0":" It is timely that we are meeting here over the next few days to seek ways and means to prevent and generally manage conf licts. While it may seem that conf lict is perennial and its forms increasingly destructive, we have the urgent task of seeking more effective ways to prevent, manage and solve it. The losses we witness or experience on a daily basis in terms of human life and devastation are unacceptable. Moreover, at a time when widespread poverty robs too many people of the opportunity to realize their full potential in life, conf lict also diverts us from development. We might ask ourselves why, after decades of efforts to rein in conf lict on a global scale and foster multilateral cooperation for sustainable peace, the results are still not where they should be. The reasons for this are several and multifaceted. First, we must appreciate that many conf licts arise when people are, or feel they are, excluded from full participation in the affairs of their country, particularly around issues that affect their everyday lives. Even a cursory look at the conf lict hotspots around the world shows us the dangerous consequences of a disenfranchised and despondent citizenry. Durable solutions can come only from an inclusive approach to both politics and development. Secondly, thorough analysis of the specific political and cultural contexts of any given conf lict is key to finding lasting solutions. Too often, the inclination is to parachute into a situation with ready- made answers based on a superficial examination of the conf licts dynamics, doing considerably more harm than good, despite good intentions. There is no one-size-fits-all remedy; these issues are complex and should be approached as such to arrive at the best possible outcome. Thirdly, the conf lict links between and development are often overlooked. If we are looking for peaceful ways to resolve and prevent conf licts, promoting development tops the list. The stakes are high. A civil conf lict costs the average developing country about 30 years of gross domestic product growth, and violence can easily spill over borders, This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of speeches delivered in the other languages.

Since security and development cannot be achieved without each other, we all — from the average citizen to Government leaders and global institutions like the United Nations — have to play our roles in order to find inclusive solutions for lasting peace and prosperity. Finally, it is increasingly obvious that local or regional initiatives aimed at resolving conf licts yield more positive results because those involved have a deeper understanding of the issues at hand. Their proximity to the conf lict makes them more invested in a comprehensive resolution and enables the necessary support for whatever process is agreed upon. We need to see these initiatives strengthened. We should be highlighting root causes as we address conf licts. In the 50 years of our independence and membership of the United Nations, Rwanda has lived through conf licts. Our country was destroyed by political exclusion and subsequent genocide. Over the past 18 years, we have been able to rebuild the country through policies that include all citizens in governance processes and by applying home-grown conf lict resolution and development mechanisms. While our experience with the United Nations since becoming a Member has been a mixed one, it has taken on a positive trajectory in recent years, and we are optimistic that it will remain there. The history of how conf licts have been handled in Rwanda, and indeed in our region, however, shows that improvement is needed. It is our obligation to point this out not in order to be critical, but because we subscribe to the ideals and principles on which the United Nations was founded. We can and should do better. Rwanda remains committed to a more effective United Nations, particularly with respect to its work towards a more peaceful, just and equitable world. We will continue to contribute to various programmes for development and peace, from our role in promoting the Millennium Development Goals and supporting the Broadband Commission for Digital Development to our troops participating in peacekeeping missions. We hope to contribute and participate even more going forward. Let me conclude by saying that although the challenge to better prevent and resolve conf lict may seem daunting, it remains ours to take on. When we see leaders work with the people in an inclusive manner; when development can proceed unhindered by conf lict; when regional groupings take greater responsibility in tackling their own issues; and when international cooperation takes place in a spirit of true partnership, I believe that the results will speak for themselves and billions of lives across the globe will improve. Ultimately, this is what we all should work towards. "}}
