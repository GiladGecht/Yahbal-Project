{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, it gives me great pleasure to convey to Mr. Vuk Jeremic my sincere congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. We wish him every success in the performance of his duties and responsibilities, particularly under the current critical circumstances in which the international community finds itself at present. I would also take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude and appreciation to his predecessor, Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, who fulfilled his mandate with wisdom and professionalism. Moreover, it gives me pleasure to commend once more the great efforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in serving the Organization and promoting its message aimed at achieving international peace and security, especially under difficult and critical circumstances. The Palestinian issue, which is at the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict, has been a constant challenge for the United Nations since its inception more than 60 years ago. The cause of the stalemate is Israels attitude. We all know how intransigent Israel has been in its positions, which have undermined negotiations and have emptied all discussions of any meaning. Moreover, Israel has taken unilateral actions that could lead to more complications in the occupied Palestinian territories and to undermining the efforts of Arab countries and others in the international community to reach a just, comprehensive and lasting solution by establishing an independent, viable and contiguous Palestinian State, with Jerusalem as its capital. The situation requires that the international community, as represented by the United Nations, move quickly in order to put an end to the calamity that the situation represents for the Palestinian people and provide all manner of support and assistance for the Palestinian Authority. My country finds that Palestine must receive full membership in the United Nations, as that is its natural and legitimate right, and we should all help the Palestinians to achieve that objective. For its part, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is sparing no effort in fulfilling its commitment to the peace process with respect to our Palestinian brethren by providing various types of support and assistance. The issue of Syria is a very complex and exacerbated one and has led to the killing and displacement of tens of thousands of people. The international community has shown its inability to act, because of divisions in the very basis of the international non-proliferation regime. As long as the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea continues to pursue its nuclear and missile programmes, achieving the goal of sustainable peace on the Korean peninsula and in the region will remain far off. Unfortunately, the international communitys aspirations were shattered once again when the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea launched a long-range missile in April 2012. In response to that provocative action, the Security Council reaffirmed that the international community will not tolerate the continued pursuit by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea of its nuclear and missile programmes by issuing a firm and resolute presidential statement in an unprecedentedly swift manner (PRS).We urge with concern that the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea should take concrete measures aimed at denuclearization, which will also open an avenue to improving the livelihood of its people. At the same time, we sincerely hope that the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea will listen to the international communitys call for the improvement of that countrys human rights situation, as repeatedly affirmed in the relevant United Nations resolutions.As a country that has risen from the ashes of war, we have learned the values of peace and security. In that context, we earnestly hope to have the opportunity to promote such values by serving as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the 2013-2014 term. The Republic of Korea is determined to fulfil that role with the greatest enthusiasm and devotion. We hope that States Members of the United Nations understand and support our bid for membership in the Council.We are united by the ideals set out in the United Nations Charter. In pursuit of international peace and security, the continued promotion of social and economic development and the promotion of human rights, we should embrace a spirit of cooperation and tolerance, with the United Nations at the centre of international efforts to that end. The Republic of Korea will persist in fully playing its part in the invaluable work of the United Nations, taking on the various challenges that humanity will continue to confront. "}}
