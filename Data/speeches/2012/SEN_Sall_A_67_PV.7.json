{"speech":{"0":" I should like to begin by extending my congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremic on his election as President of the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, and I wish him every success. I would also like to commend Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, for his positive contribution to the proceedings of the Assembly. I would like to reiterate to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon the encouragement and support of Senegal in the conduct of his delicate mission at the head of our Organization.On 25 March 2012, in a two-round, keenly contested presidential election, the Senegalese people, inspired by its values of democracy and freedom, calmly and serenely voted massively, by more than 65 per cent, for change and the respect of republican norms. We were supported by friendly countries and organizations in that great undertaking, which was aimed at the consolidation of our democratic tradition, especially through the improvement of our electoral institutions and the monitoring of the various stages of the process. I would like to express here my deep gratitude to all those who supported that process.In my capacity as Senegals newly elected President, let me reiterate our faith in our shared values and in the mandate of the United Nations to promote, through cooperation, the advent of a better and friendlier world for all.Building a better world entails, undoubtedly and above all, working together for peace to reign among and within our peoples, as suggested by the theme of this session: “Adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means”.Born out of the ashes and ruins of war, the United Nations is the expression of the dream of and hope for a world free from the spectre of antagonism and of any Manichaean view whereby the good are on one side and the bad on the other.Sixty-seven years on, through mediation efforts and good offices, conciliation, arbitration and peace missions, the United Nations has made a considerable 11and internationally recognized borders, is one of our longest-standing unfulfilled promises, even though its fulfilment is the only guarantee for a peaceful, fair and lasting settlement of the Middle East crisis. In the interest of all the peoples of the region and the world, it is high time that the Holy Land of the three revealed religions no longer be a land of fire, blood and tears. The light of wisdom emanating from its spiritual legacies requires it instead to be a land of peace and human fraternity.In Africa, as in the rest of the world, Senegal welcomes and supports the progress of democracy and fundamental freedoms. We are deeply concerned because some leaders deny the obvious fact that the destiny of humankind is to live free, and respond to the legitimate aspirations of their people with appalling violence against innocent civilians.The adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means, the apt theme of this session, should not overshadow other emergencies and unmet needs. More than ever before, we live today in an era of paradoxes and unanswered questions. The greatest paradox of our time is that never before in human history has the world accumulated so much wealth even though never before in human history has the world counted so many poor. So what will the world of tomorrow be like? The question is indeed difficult, but to govern is to foresee and we cannot dodge it.What kind of world do we want when, 20 years after the Rio Earth Summit, it is a proven fact that continuous environmental degradation as a result of human activity threatens to jeopardize the conditions for life on Earth? What kind of world do we want when, according to estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, more than 900 million people suffer from undernourishment even though agriculture has the potential to feed more than twice the planets population? What kind of world do we want when, in our towns and villages, millions of human beings have no access to basic social services and millions of women die in childbirth?What kind of world do we want when millions of young people, after years of study, hard work and sacrifice to escape their misery, rather than realizing their dreams are rewarded with nothing but the nightmare and indignity of unemployment? What kind of world do we want when millions of fathers and mothers working for the minimum wage wake up contribution to the pacification of international relations. Yet, although commendable progress has been achieved, threats to peace and security remain worrisome and have radically evolved.That is the case in northern Mali, where organized and heavily armed terrorist groups, living off trafficking of all kinds, are occupying, in complete illegality, two thirds of the country, sowing despair among the population and destroying symbols of the worlds cultural heritage. Northern Mali has become a lawless area, used as a safe haven for recruitment and training by the international terrorist nebula, which wrongly uses Islam as a pretext to disguise its criminal activities and seeks to attack foreign interests as well as extend its reach to other countries of the subregion.As the guarantor of the collective security of Member States under the Charter of the United Nations, the Security Council has an obligation to act in order to bring an end to such a situation. If it does not do so, it will have failed to live up to its responsibilities. Therefore we call once again on the Council to authorize all actions required to combat those terrorist groups and restore the countrys territorial integrity.In addition, I reiterate our firm rejection of any partition of Mali and our condemnation of the 22 March 2012 coup detat. It is our conviction that in Africa as elsewhere, the place of the army is in the barracks, under the command of a civilian authority.As for Guinea-Bissau, we, like other Economic Community of West African States member States, appreciate the efforts made by the transitional Government towards national reconciliation, the re-establishment of the countrys institutions, the holding of credible elections and the definitive withdrawal of the army from the political arena.Already ravaged by years of institutional and economic instability, Guinea-Bissau also faces the issue of foreign drug traffickers. The country deserves the attention and support of the international community.The same holds true for Palestine.In its capacity as Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, Senegal restates its support for the creation of a viable and independent Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital and with a seat here among free nations. A viable and independent Palestine, living in peace with the State of Israel, each within secure 12 unfounded feelings of suspicion and fear that deform our common humanity.If humankind embraces the “civilization of the universal” advocated by my illustrious compatriot, the late President and poet Leopold Sedar Senghor, man will no longer be a wolf to man, as Hobbes said. Instead, as the saying in our country goes, man will become a remedy to man. We owe that to ourselves and to future generations."}}
