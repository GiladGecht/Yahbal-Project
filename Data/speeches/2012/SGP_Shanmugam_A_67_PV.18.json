{"speech":{"0":" I extend my congratulations to Mr. Vuk Jeremic on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I wish him every success in the year ahead.The global economic situation remains uncertain. Europe is in recession and growth in other places is weakening. There is increasing concern that this combination of weak consumer demand in developing countries and a continuing crisis in the eurozone may lead to a global recession. An even greater danger, especially for small States like Singapore that depend on global trade, is the risk of increased protectionism.Populist pressures in countries affected by austerity and economic crisis can cause further instability as politicians become unwilling or unable to deal with long-term, structural economic problems. While emerging economies focus on maintaining economic growth, developed economies are preoccupied with both immediate and structural socioeconomic problems. Understandably, there is less focus on strategic regional and international issues. However, serious, long-term challenges remain. Rising income disparities, climate change issues and worries about food security are not being adequately addressed at the global level.Amid that uncertainty, no State or group of States currently has the power to definitively set the international agenda. Decision-making and governance on global issues have and will continue to become increasingly complicated. The multiplicity of interests 36 As major beneficiaries of a stable international system, it is incumbent upon small States to not only support the international rule of law, but to also speak up against its violation. This year, the 105-member Forum of Small States will commemorate its twentieth anniversary with a high-level conference on small States on 1 October. The conference will discuss the role of small States in international relations, including our commitment to the rule of law and the peaceful settlement of disputes. We invite all Member States to attend the conference. We hope that the conference will be a platform for small States to share our experiences and remind the international community that small States, too, have contributions to make to the maintenance of an international system that benefits all nations of any size."}}
