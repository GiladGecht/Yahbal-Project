{"speech":{"0":" Allow me, at the outset, to join fellow Member States in congratulating the President of the General Assembly on his election to preside over the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session and to commend his predecessor for his successful stewardship of the most recent session.I would like to seize this momentous occasion to express our deepest gratitude and appreciation to the Secretary-General for the passion and compassion he has shown in responding to the various global challenges facing the Organization and, most important, his unwavering personal support for our referendum on self-determination, our independence and the speedy admission of the Republic of South Sudan into the United Nations.Furthermore, we are also deeply grateful to the Assembly for the warmth, generosity and hospitality 25My Government is striving harder than ever to combat corruption in our public service. Along with reformed systems for management of public funds and tighter controls, we are combating corruption through the rule of law and through greater transparency and accountability. The Government has enacted legislation that holds public officials accountable and brings the management of our resources closer to international standards.The Government has published the entire annual budget and opened our books to public scrutiny. By the end of the year, we aim to be up to date on all of the audits of our national accounts since the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, in 2005. As an accountable Government before our people, we still believe that there is a long way ahead to achieve the efficiency, transparency and accountability in our public service and financial management. Despite the economic peril since the shut-down of oil production, we are, nevertheless, encouraged that the current period of austerity has strengthened our resolve to press ahead in our reform agenda and has allowed us to lay a strong foundation for more efficient and accountable governance beyond the austerity period — tough times never last, but tough people do.With regard to security, the Republic of South Sudan is currently facing security threats in the form of armed militia groups that are creating insecurity and undermining our young democracy. The Government has accorded the highest priority to reaching a peaceful resolution to these internal conflicts. Four of the armed militia groups have laid down their weapons and have integrated voluntarily into our national army and civilian life.We believe that the internal and external security of our nation is a prerequisite for having meaningful economic development and social progress. While we are working tirelessly towards achieving and maintaining peace within our borders, critical unresolved issues remain between South Sudan and the Sudan, including border demarcation, citizenship rights, the status of Abyei and oil-related issues. The lack of progress on those post-independence issues has been posing a threat to peace and stable relations between the two countries.Our relations with the Sudan reached a critical juncture last year, when Khartoum blocked tankers loaded with our crude oil and prevented them from departing from Port Sudan. In addition, Sudan seized will not be good for the stability of the country if we have many hungry and angry men. In our endeavour to achieve food security, we are diversifying the economy by utilizing oil revenues to fuel agriculture and build the necessary basic infrastructure. This is the only way we can benefit from the vast fertile agricultural lands that our country is generously endowed with.Our public service is functioning satisfactorily, especially after the introduction of far-reaching public service reforms. That has brought about efficiency and transparency in service delivery. We have introduced constructive and effective reforms in our public financial management and have strengthened measures to improve transparency and accountability.As for education, we have increased access to education for all children in South Sudan. Since the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, in 2005, enrolment in our primary schools has more than doubled. In the past year, we continued to strengthen and expand the education sector by further introducing alternative education. This innovative notion of an alternative education system is currently offering accelerated learning programmes to more than 200,000 youth and adults. Favourable conditions and terms of service for teachers have been introduced throughout the country, and the Government is working tirelessly to meet the rapidly increasing demand for secondary education caused by the increase in primary school enrolment.However, the Government still has a long way to go in providing educational opportunities for our children and youth that prepare them for the future and meet their expectations and aspirations. At this juncture, allow me to commend the launch by the Secretary-General of the Global Initiative on Education, which we hope will open up avenues of collaboration between South Sudan and the international community on improving education access for our children.Our nascent nation has been tested enormously in its first year of independence. We have been tested by conflicts within and beyond our borders; we have been tested by severe economic hardship; and we have been tested by the revelation of severe abuse of the public trust and funds resulting partly from malpractice and lack of capacity. The Government is undertaking serious corrective measures and institutional capacity-building to address that issue in order to restore public confidence.26 In that connection, South Sudan is currently carrying the burden of accommodating an increasing number of refugees from the two areas. We therefore call upon the international community to assist in meeting the humanitarian needs of the refugees within South Sudan, as well as throughout the Sudanese territory for those internally displaced by the conflict.Our President stated in his statement at our independence celebration:“We cannot abandon them, but would support their cause peacefully through negotiated settlement between them and the Government of the Sudan”. South Sudan will use its good offices as a former ally of the SPLM-North to assist the Sudan by acting as an honest broker in mediating a peaceful, but just, resolution of the conflict. We believe that our role as honest brokers will in the long term assist our neighbour to the north, the Government of the Sudan, to achieve peace and stability. We are glad that the United Nations recognizes that there can be no military solution to the conflict and that a negotiated settlement is the way forward.I am pleased to inform the Assembly that, today, President Salva Kiir Mayardit and President Omer Hassan A. Al-Bashir signed an agreement that will allow the two countries to pursue their national development efforts under a secure and lasting peace. We are hopeful that the new agreement with the Sudan will lead to the resolution of our differences on security, borders and the use of petroleum infrastructure.It is envisaged that if each side upholds its part of this agreement, the most significant causes of dispute between our two countries will have been amicably resolved. Diplomacy will have won, and reason will have prevailed. With the resolution of those key matters, preparations to resume oil production in South Sudan will now begin. The following agreements were signed today between our two countries: first, the Agreement Concerning Oil and Related Economic Matters; second, the Framework Agreement on the Status of Nationals of the Other State; third, the Agreement on the Demarcation of the Boundary; fourth, an agreement on border issues; fifth, the Agreement on a Framework for Cooperation on Central Banking Issues; sixth, the Agreement on Trade and Trade-related Issues; seventh, the Agreement on Certain Economic Matters: Division of Assets and Liabilities, Arrears and Claims and Joint and resold crude oil that we had sold to international customers. By January, we had lost some $800 million in revenues. At that point, my Government was left with no choice but to shut down oil production. The decision was publicly supported by the majority of our people.In the context of relations of South Sudan and the Sudan, it is incumbent upon my Government to shed some light of what became known as the Heglig or Panthou incident between us and the Republic of the Sudan. That crisis was the result of increasing border tensions and repeated bombings in the border areas of my country by the Sudanese Armed Forces.In April, our forces clashed with the Sudanese army in an area inside South Sudan, several kilometers south of Heglig. That resulted in our armed forces taking over Heglig temporarily; we acted in self-defence to prevent Heglig from being used as a launching pad for military attacks by the Sudanese Armed Forces on our country.In compliance with advice from the international community, we withdraw our forces soon thereafter. Although Heglig is historically part of South Sudan, it was not our intention to take it by force. We believe that we can settle the matter through peaceful negotiations.Another area in which we believe we have not been well understood by the international community is our alleged support for the Sudan Peoples Liberation Movement – North (SPLM-North). What may not be fully appreciated by outside observers is that those forces were integral members of the SPLM. But although they fought side by side with us, they were not fighting for the independence of southern Sudan, but for their own cause through alliance with us. Of course, we shared a common vision of creating a new, fundamentally restructured united Sudan of inclusivity, equity and dignity for all, without discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion or culture. But we also had issues that were specific to our particular situation and which, for us, eventually led to our independence.It should be recalled that the CPA included a special protocol on Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states that addressed their special grievances. That protocol is yet to be credibly implemented. As the SPLM-North were former allies who contributed significantly to our success in achieving the objectives of our struggle, we obviously have a moral and, indeed, political obligation to assist them in addressing their legitimate grievances, as stipulated and agreed in the CPA. 27Republic of South Sudan for the statement he has just made.Mr. Riek Machar Teny-Dhurgon, Vice-President of the Republic of South Sudan, was escorted from the rostrum.Address by Mr. Winston Baldwin Spencer, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Antigua and Barbuda "}}
