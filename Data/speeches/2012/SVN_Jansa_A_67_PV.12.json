{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, let me congratulate His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremic, President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, on his election and wish him success in discharging his duties. It is my honour to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his able leadership and tireless efforts in guiding the United Nations in these demanding times.The theme of this session of the General Assembly is “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means”. We had an opportunity to listen to the speakers at the opening of the session, who stressed the importance of preventing violence and the responsibility of all Member States, their leaders and international organizations to victims and witnessed its horrors have died. They died with memories, preserved in their minds and hearts, of their beautiful world that was devastated, their warm homes that were demolished and their peaceful villages that were erased from existence, and of the renaissance that was undermined, and their loved ones, dear men, women and children, who were killed in wars, massacres, attacks, raids and incursions, and of their beautiful country that was a beacon of coexistence, tolerance, progress and a crossroads of civilization. They died displaced and in refugee camps to which they were expelled following their uprooting from their homeland, as they awaited the moment in which they would resume their suspended lives, complete their interrupted journey and repair their shattered dreams. They died while they clung to their legitimate human right to justice, freedom and redress for the historically unprecedented injustice inflicted upon them. Has the time not come to undo that injustice?At present, 77 per cent of the Palestinian people are under the age of 35. Although they did not experience the horrors of Al-Nakba, they know very well all its horrendous details from the accounts of their parents and grandparents who endured it. They continue to suffer from its ongoing effects today and every day as a result of the practices of the occupation and of the settlers on a land that is diminishing in size. The horizon before them is closed to their simple, ordinary dreams. They see their homeland and their present and future vulnerable to continued usurpation and they say firmly: we shall not allow a new Al-Nakba to happen.I say to the Assembly that the brave Palestinian people will not allow themselves to be the victims of a new Al-Nakba. We will not allow that. We will stay on our land. My people will continue their epic steadfastness and eternal survival journey in their beloved land, every inch of which carries evidence and landmarks affirming their roots and unique connection to the land throughout ancient history. There is no homeland for us except Palestine and there is no land for us but Palestine. We shall not accept an alternative homeland, nor an alternative land. Palestine is our homeland and shall remain our homeland.Our people will continue to build the institutions of their State and strive to achieve national reconciliation to restore the unity of our nation, people and institutions via resorting to the ballot box, which will confirm our peoples pluralistic democratic choice. Our people are also determined to continue peaceful popular 36 of this session that we should give the responsibility to protect concept a tangible meaning.To my regret, however, we have not yet achieved a common understanding on the modalities involved. We should therefore focus and strengthen our dialogue to that end. There is room for improving the modes of collaboration between the national, regional and international levels.It will be recalled that after the Second World War more than 80 countries witnessed mass atrocities. At least 53 million innocent lives were lost. Behind those numbers were real men and women made of f lesh and blood, and also children. They had futures but were not allowed to live. Behind those numbers there are still traumatized families and the distorted creative potential of the affected societies. Bearing that in mind, we should be able to set at least basic limits on human behaviour and stop mass atrocities.I therefore urge the States Members of the United Nations, the members of the regional and subregional organizations and the United Nations system to develop a new strategy to prevent genocide and other mass atrocities. Moreover, an intergovernmental forum of like-minded countries should be formed to propose a United Nations resolution that would set a clear mandate for the preparation and adoption of an appropriate legal mechanism — a legal mechanism that would provide the responsibility to protect concept with new tools, a legal mechanism that would enforce crime prevention, a mechanism to facilitate a more rapid and effective response to acts of genocide and other mass atrocities.Slovenia stands ready to start a dialogue to that end. We are going to convene the first meeting in the following months. I am glad that we have already enlisted substantial support for the initiative during this Assembly session. The initiative originates from international civil society. The Institute for Cultural Diplomacy in Berlin has collected many thousands of supporters among international non-governmental organizations, lawyers, students, journalists and other individuals. Support is on the increase, and this is not just one isolated initiative. There are many others across the globe.We should, of course, also enhance our collaboration with a view to the prosecution of alleged perpetrators of genocide and mass atrocities, including individual States. Effective prosecution undoubtedly has a deterrent effect and contributes substantially to take any action they can to prevent and raise awareness of such horrible events.Among other issues of global concern, I would like to draw the Assemblys attention to the horrific scenes in Syria. A civil war has been dragging on there for many months. Efforts at mediation unfortunately have failed. It shocks our conscience that we have been unable to stop the bloodshed. Sadly, we have not succeeded in protecting civilians. In my view, the situation is critical. It speaks to the urgent need to consider strengthening the preventive capacities of the United Nations, its States Members and regional organizations.Concerted efforts to avert mass atrocities are needed. Last year we celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of the entry into force of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The Convention was the result of the tireless efforts of Mr. Raphael Lemkin, a Polish lawyer. He stalked the halls of the United Nations every day until December 1948, when the General Assembly finally adopted the Convention. Afterwards he continued his work, and his endeavours paid off in 1951, when the Convention came into force.We then waited half a century to see the first conviction of an individual for the crime of genocide. The establishment of the International Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda in the 1990s was followed by the historic creation of the permanent International Criminal Court. That was another milestone in the humanization of international relations. A further encouraging development is that the United Nations system has improved its internal coordination of activities related to the prevention of genocide. The Offices of the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide and Mass Atrocities and the Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect were established at that time. The Human Rights Council has helped to promote the culture of prevention.Over the past months, the Syrian tragedy has increased awareness of our responsibility to prevent and stop mass atrocities. United States President Barack Obama has established a promising atrocities prevention board and, in his remarks at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in April, made the point that national sovereignty was never a licence to slaughter your people. I hope we all share his belief that preventing genocide is an achievable goal. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged in his speech at the opening 37from Israel, and it is good to see all of the representatives here.Three thousand years ago, King David reigned over the Jewish State in our eternal capital, Jerusalem. I say that to all those who proclaim that the Jewish State has no roots in our region and that it will soon disappear. Throughout our history, the Jewish people have overcome all the tyrants who have sought our destruction. It is their ideologies that have been discarded by history. The people of Israel live on. We say in Hebrew, the Jewish State will live forever.The Jewish people have lived in the land of Israel for thousands of years. Even after most of our people were exiled from it, Jews continued to live in the land of Israel throughout the ages. The masses of our people never gave up the dream of returning to our ancient homeland. Defying the laws of history, we did just that. We ingathered the exiles, restored our independence and rebuilt our national life. The Jewish people have come home. We will never be uprooted again.Yesterday was Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year. Every year, for over three millennia, we have come together on this day of reflection and atonement. We take stock of our past. We pray for our future. We remember the sorrows of our persecution; we remember the great travails of our dispersion; we mourn the extermination of a third of our people, 6 million, in the Holocaust.But at the end of Yom Kippur, we celebrate. We celebrate the rebirth of Israel. We celebrate the heroism of our young men and women who have defended our people with the indomitable courage of Joshua, David and the Maccabees of old. We celebrate the marvel of the f lourishing modern Jewish State. In Israel we walk the same paths as those trodden by our patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. But we blaze new trails in science, technology, medicine and agriculture. In Israel the past and the future find common ground.Unfortunately, that is not the case in many other countries. For today, a great battle is being waged between the modern and the medieval. The forces of modernity seek a bright future in which the rights of all are protected, in which an ever-expanding digital library is available in the palm of every child, in which every life is sacred.The forces of medievalism seek a world in which women and minorities are subjugated, in which a culture of prevention. Moreover, a genuine culture of prevention needs to be developed globally. We should improve our understanding of the warning signs, which should trigger early action.These days we witness numerous acts of violence against diplomatic and consular missions in one part of our world. I strongly condemn such violent acts. They can never be justified. Freedom of speech is fundamental in a democracy, and a violent response has never been able to silence it. Only by strengthening intercultural dialogue can we diminish the potential for conflict. Only mutual respect can contribute to maintaining peace and security.Mr. Prosor (Israel), Vice-President, took the Chair.It was in 1946 that Raphael Lemkin asserted that our whole heritage is a product of the contributions of all nations. Each and every nation and the United Nations as a whole have an enormous responsibility, and also an opportunity, to prevent future atrocities. We cannot escape our history but let us learn from it.I fully believe that we do not want the mistakes of yesterday to be repeated tomorrow. We took over the responsibility for the world from our fathers and have an enormous responsibility to make it a better place for our children. I therefore invite all here to do so by joining in our efforts for a world free from genocide."}}
