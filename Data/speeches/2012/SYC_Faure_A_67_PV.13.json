{"speech":{"0":" In the modern world, the pace of change, whether political, social or economic, challenges our ability to react in a constructive, sustainable and just manner. And in the face of change, the role of the General Assembly becomes even more important, as the President of the General Assembly has reminded us. We look to the United Nations — our United Nations and our General Assembly — to help us find the common ground needed for the resolution of the big questions of our time. We can truly be a “G-193”, as our President has previously remarked.As an oceanic island nation, Seychelles understands intrinsically that the development of our region depends upon being able to defuse conflict and tension through diplomacy and on defining a framework to properly share all the opportunities that our ocean offers us. In the Indian Ocean, we are particularly concerned with two issues that challenge the proper application of the rule of law in a sustainable manner: the continued problem of maritime piracy and the resolution of the political crisis in Madagascar.Piracy fundamentally alters our relationship with our ocean. Piracy instils fear and uncertainty. We have two compatriots still being held captive in Somalia, and, as long as they remain separated from their families, our ocean represents risk for our nation, rather than the opportunity that it should. Establishing the rule of law in Somalia is obviously the only true long-term and sustainable solution to piracy. We welcome the moves in Somalia and by the international community to strengthen those efforts.Seychelles is already working with the central Government of Somalia, as well as the regions of Somaliland and Puntland, to be able to transfer prosecuted prisoners to serve their sentences in their country of origin. This is a key part of building the rule 20 us. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development has given new momentum to the concept of the blue economy.We are also very aware that the ocean will always be a shared space. As an archipelago, we are privileged to be custodians of that space. This year, for the first time in the history of the United Nations, Seychelles and Mauritius, two neighbouring SIDS, have agreed on joint management of an area of extended continental shelf of 3,000 square kilometres. That means that we are sharing the space for the benefit of our two peoples development. We are sharing the responsibility and the opportunity. We believe that all nations, large or small, must contribute to making this planet a better world to live in.Seychelles recently announced its intention to stand for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council in the year 2017, subject to endorsement by the African Union. We are doing so because we believe that the voices of all nations matter, whether they are large or small, rich or poor. As the smallest African nation, we keenly understand that we need to fight for Africas economic independence. We are committed to the ideals of the African Union, on the basis of which we attained our political freedom. Now more than ever we must invest in Africas economic freedom. We must create the means by which Africas share of trade and financial power can increase at a faster rate. We must empower African institutions. Seychelles adds its voice to the call for more investment in the African Development Bank, including by African nations themselves, by investing their reserves in it.We must also foster peace on our continent by leading efforts to find solutions to our problems, such as in Somalia, Madagascar and elsewhere in Africa. As a small island developing State, we have a greater understanding than ever of the ways in which our planet is under threat from climate change, and of the need to act now for the sake of all humankind. Most of all, as citizens of planet Earth, we understand that as individuals and as a nation our decisions have consequences beyond our borders. They have consequences for our future and for our children. These are all issues that must be weighed carefully, and it is important that all voices be considered in the debate. We thank the Assembly for giving due consideration to the voice of Seychelles.through the rule of law in Madagascar that we will be able to depend on sustainable development in the Indian Ocean.(spoke in English)Respect for the rule of law is also about ensuring that conditions are in place for equity and fairness in the international system as a whole. Small island developing States (SIDS) are too often on the periphery of most international decision-making bodies. Seychelles is proposing that SIDS be considered as offering unique opportunities for testing innovative policies and technologies that can benefit all humankind. In the fight against climate change, SIDS could be at the forefront of groundbreaking solutions.For example, the Global Island Partnership, co-chaired by Seychelles, Palau and Grenada, has proposed considering debt cancellation for SIDS to enable them to better prepare for climate change adaptation. A large number of SIDS have debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratios in excess of 100 per cent, and such debt forgiveness would give them more f lexibility within their own budgets to prepare to face climate change, and thus protect some of the most environmentally sensitive zones on the planet.With regard to the high volatility of international fuel prices, SIDS can strengthen their resilience through investment in renewable energy. We warmly welcome the Sustainable Energy for All initiative championed by the Secretary-General, and we commit our support to making it a success. While the latest technology in renewable energy often represents a significant capital outlay, by developing pilot projects in SIDS we can potentially create economies based on 100 per cent renewable energy that can then be replicated on a larger scale.Finally, it is very important that consideration be given to how to better support SIDS within the international trading system. Trade-based support for SIDS could easily be established without disruption or distortion of the global f low of goods and services. Islands are particularly reliant on open access to trade with as many countries as possible. In the context of the current challenges to food security, we urge that all barriers affecting trade with islands, including the economic embargo on Cuba, be lifted, since they serve only to increase the inherent challenges associated with trading from a position of insularity. As an island State, we are aware that the ocean must connect us, not divide 21and laudable human experiences that f lourished in our glorious land.Our renewed ambition to build a modern State where the Iraqi people enjoy freedom, development and prosperity requires us to move towards the establishment of good, friendly and equal relations with all nations in the world, within the framework of a cooperative international system governed by clear rules that prevent the problems and crises that could undermine its prosperity and stability. The new Iraq has chosen to embark on the path of cooperation and coordination with the international community in the political, economic and development spheres. Those efforts have been coupled with significant qualitative leaps in our economic growth that will qualify Iraq to return to the realm of the world economy and to emerge within the international economic system, based on a realistic vision that has achieved a number of positive developments over recent years.According to various indicators, our gross domestic product (GDP) has doubled, which has in turn doubled the per capita share of the GDP. According to projections by the International Monetary Fund, Iraqs GDP is expected to reach approximately $150 billion in 2014. The Iraqi Government has also succeeded in implementing policies to curb inflation and to control governmental spending, in addition to our success in collaborating with the international community to reduce the debt accumulated by the country over past decades.We have embraced a theory of balanced growth in our national development plans for the upcoming years, in which the oil sector is to serve as the engine for other sectors. Iraq has oil reserves amounting to about 143 billion barrels and potential reserves surpassing the current estimated proven reserves, in addition to large reserves of natural gas amounting to 126.7 trillion cubic feet. We expect investments to contribute to substantial development in the oil industry in Iraq through licensing rounds, establishing refineries and other oil- and gas-related sectors and industries. Estimates suggest that from 2017 to 2020 production will reach more than 10 million barrels of oil per day. The development plan will include all sectors and infrastructure in order to provide secure and promising investment opportunities. The Iraqi Government has prepared legislation to promote confidence in the Iraqi economy by providing legal protection for foreign investments in Iraq through the guarantees listed in the "}}
