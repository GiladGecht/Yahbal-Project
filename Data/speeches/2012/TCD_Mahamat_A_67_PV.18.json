{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, allow me on behalf of the Chadian delevation to wholeheartedly thank the President for selecting the theme for the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly, “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means”. That subject is at the very heart of the principles that underlie the existence of our Organization, and reflects the global concerns of our day. Indeed, the world is in an period of unprecedented tension, perhaps even more serious than that following the Cold War. From Afghanistan to Mali; from Pakistan to Somalia; from Libya to Syria; and from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to that of the Sudan and South Sudan, most of the crises that have recently shaken and continue to shake our planet, while undoubtedly rooted in political and social claims, also have considerable religious and cultural undertones that are often difficult to address. Africa is the crucible of all the scourges affecting the world. The war and attacks in Somalia, the situation in Mali, the crises in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and between the two Sudans, violence in Libya and outbreaks in Cote dIvoire and the Central African Republic are situations which many attempts to resolve have proved ineffective. Based on the principle that without peace and security development is not possible, the international community, embodied in the United Nations, has the firm obligation to contribute The five permanent members of the Security Council, with their veto powers, have the primary responsibility to make the Council more effective. That is why Singapore has consistently called for improvement in the Security Councils working methods. The Security Council is not a rubber stamp for the interests of its individual members. Its power, if not visibly and openly wielded for the greater good and to discharge its mandate in all instances, will eventually undermine its legitimacy and leadership role in the international community. That is in no ones interest.Singapore believes that the long-term goal of the United Nations should be to provide an effective system of international law and resilient mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of disputes. That will provide a platform for States under threat to bring their problems before those mechanisms with confidence, rather than trying to resolve them by force.The President has selected an important theme for the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly: bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means. In a fast-changing environment, where the global governance structure is fragmented and coordination is difficult, the parameters of dialogue among States become crucial. In that dialogue among States, respect for the rule of law by all parties is essential. If that were not the case, small States would lose their independence and autonomy, and even the larger and stronger States could never feel entirely secure. A stable international system is critical to our collective security. Small States like Singapore are vulnerable even at the best of times, and these are not the best of times. It is therefore particularly important for small States to be in an international environment where international law and institutions based on law can f lourish. We need a predictable and stable, rules-based international system in order for all of us to survive.Singapore firmly believes in the importance of safeguarding the international rule of law. We have participated actively in various multilateral negotiations, used international dispute mechanisms, such as the International Court of Justice and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, to resolve disputes we have had with other countries. Our view is that disputes, including those over territorial sovereignty, can and should be resolved peacefully, in accordance with international law. 37the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States (CEN-SAD) have undertaken a reform of our organization, which will incorporate peace and security dimensions into its updated texts. The President of the Republic of Chad, Mr. Idriss Deby Itno, has invited his colleagues from member countries to a summit meeting in NDjamena on 29 November to adopt new texts aimed at refocusing CEN-SADs objectives on the specific concerns of the region. The ability of extremist groups to cause harm across borders calls for a collective and appropriate response. Our community, CEN-SAD, which includes almost all of the countries of the Sahel and the Saraha, seems to be the appropriate structure in which to bring together all our response strategies. Drawing on lessons from the difficulties experienced by the United Nations on the ground, Chad requested the departure in 2010 of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT). The Mission had been mandated to stabilize the region and protect Sudanese refugee camps in Darfur and those of internally displaced persons in eastern Chad. Despite a huge budget and considerable resources, that force did not prove to be an effective deterrent. It left the bulk of the work to the Detachement integre de securite (DIS), a special national Chadian force made up 600 men and women. After MINURCATs departure, Chad decided to entrust DIS with the protection of refugees and displaced persons and any humanitarian organizations that provided assistance. A joint support programme for DIS was signed in February 2011 in order to mobilize the necessary logistical financial support to enable it to operate. The overall budget was estimated to be $20 million, about 2 per cent of the budget allocated to MINURCAT, which, I would remind the Assembly, amounted to some $800 million per year. That support has not yet been forthcoming, and Chad has been bearing the cost of the unit alone, estimated at about $4 million per year. I would also remind the Assembly that the responsibility of providing security to refugees, displaced persons and humanitarian organizations living in that region cannot and should not be left to Chad alone. The international community has the obligation to consider that issue and address it. That is why Chad is reiterating the special appeal it launched from this rostrum last year, requesting our Organization to take heed.Africa sorely needs international solidarity, not only to settle the conflicts and crises sweeping through to establishing peace by making use of all the legal mechanisms at its disposal for settling conflict. The Organization has been particularly active in recent years in different theatres of conflict, such as Afghanistan, Darfur, Cote dIvoire, Libya and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since its inception, the United Nations has never been so involved in different hotbeds of tension around the world. We commend that presence because of its calming and legitimizing effect on populations and even on protagonists. However, we also need to ponder the form and effectiveness of that presence. The stalemate in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, despite the massive and costly deployments of the forces mandated by the United Nations, clearly reflect the inability of the international community to impose peace where it is necessary. The crisis in Mali comes as a test and a challenge for the international community. Along with that crisis, obscurantist and violent religious fundamentalism, drug and human trafficking and irredentist claims have taken root in the very heart of Africa today. Can the world continue to stand by for much longer given that that gangrene, of which Mali is only the epicentre, threatens to spread throughout the entire Sahel? Our delegation commends the determination of the international community seen at the high-level meeting on the Sahel that was organized on the initiative of the Secretary-General. We commend the commitments of France, the Economic Community of West African States and above all those of the primary party concerned, namely, Mali, to act to eradicate that gangrene. The United Nations, too, needs to expedite procedures and act quickly by adopting a resolution that would authorize the intervention of an international military force. I would like to take advantage of my presence at this rostrum to warmly commend Mr. Omer Hassan A. Al-Bashir of the Sudan and Mr. Salva Kiir of South Sudan, who overcame their differences and reached a peace and security agreement, albeit partial. We sincerely hope that the agreement will quickly lead to a final understanding, which is so necessary to the progress of the countries and to the stability of the subregion. It is my pleasure to inform the Assembly that within the framework of subregional initiatives with respect to peace and security in the Sahel, the member countries of 38 Despite all those constraints and the sacrifices undertaken by Chad, we have not been able to benefit from the debt relief that comes with reaching the completion point. We therefore call on our bilateral and multilateral partners to take into account our unique situation and support us as we move forward. The theme of our session this year reminds us that all of the formulas that have been used to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have failed. As the crisis goes on and on, it is becoming accepted; yet, it is at the very root of the worst violence the world has seen in recent years. The community of nations cannot behave like an ostrich indefinitely, allowing a crisis as old as the United Nations itself to drag on interminably — a crisis which is a constant threat to peace and the regional and global balance. Here, too, old postures need to change and robust initiatives need to be taken to put an end to the conflict, which has gone on far too long.The international realities of our time should also strengthen our determination to bring about the reform of the Security Council. The primary innovation should be to expand its membership, with the admission of Africa as a permanent member with the right of veto. The world has greatly changed. We therefore need to adapt our global governance to these developments.In conclusion, the delegation of Chad, through me, would like to express how much we admire the newly elected Presidents steering of the work of the General Assembly. We also would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his personal commitment in the quest for peace worldwide. We firmly hope that his efforts will be successful and bring about more justice and serenity for humankind."}}
