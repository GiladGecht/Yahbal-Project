{"speech":{"0":" It is an honour and a privilege to address this forum today and to share the views of the Republic of Macedonia regarding a number of issues of concern for all of us.Allow me first to extend our congratulations to Mr. Vuk Jeremic on his election to the prestigious position of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I believe Mr. Jeremic will respond to all the challenges and tasks that await him, and I wish to express our full readiness to cooperate. Allow me also to express my thanks and to compliment the former President of the Assembly, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his successful presidency during the sixth-sixth session.I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the work and efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, which undoubtedly have contributed to strengthening the role and reputation of the world Organization. It was a real honour for me and for the citizens of Macedonian to be his host. The Republic of Macedonia highly values and supports the Secretary-Generals endeavours, and he can count on our continued full support.Now, more than ever in the history of humankind, the nations of the world are confronted with the same challenges, are victims of the same threats and share the yearning for a better future. Effective multilateralism is of essential importance for the development of collective action to respond to common challenges. The United Nations is an organization whose legitimacy to tackle global challenges through global actions is universally accepted and undeniable. The support provided by Member States is of crucial importance. I wish to assure the Assembly that the Republic of Macedonia will continue to contribute actively to the reinforcement and improvement of the efficiency of the system.This diverse world is in need of a common denominator, a link that unites all individuals, peoples and countries regardless of differences in culture, language and religion. That link is the Charter of the United Nations, with its principles and fundamental equally important that Myanmar should be viewed from a different and new perspective. It is also necessary for us to be able to work in a more favourable environment than ever before.Myanmar is now ushering in a new era. As a member in the family of nations, Myanmar will participate more actively in the activities of the United Nations in various fields. Standing as a responsible and respectable nation on the world stage, we will take on the challenges of the twenty-first century in a bold and resolute manner.I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment as General-Secretary and on his achievements thus far.Before I conclude, allow me to briefly mention an important figure, namely, U Thant, a brilliant son of Myanmar who served as the third Secretary-General. Even in those days, U Thant had a vision of one world. He envisioned a global society guided by the spirit of one world â€” a world safe for diversity and a place of peaceful coexistence where global citizens could practice the virtues of tolerance, cooperation, understanding and compassion. We believe that if we make his vision a reality, we will soon achieve a world that is more peaceful and prosperous. U Thants tireless endeavours for peace and his achievements during his tenure as the Secretary-General will never be forgotten. The people of Myanmar will always take pride in and remember him as a great son of Myanmar."}}
