{"speech":{"0":" Uganda joins other delegations in congratulating Mr. Jeremic on his election as President of this body. My delegation has full confidence in his ability to steer our deliberations, and he can count on our support. I also wish to commend Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for his effective leadership during the last session.The international community has made significant progress in reducing conflicts around the world over the two decades since the end of the Cold War and the eventual freedom of South Africa from apartheid. However, we still face challenges arising from conflicts that take a heavy toll on nations and people around the world. The theme for this sessions debate is therefore timely and pertinent. We are again seeing an increase in conflicts brought about by unconstitutional changes of Governments, disputed elections, social tensions, extremist ideologies and territorial or border disputes, among other causes. We must redouble our efforts to resolve conflicts and disputes through peaceful means and in conformity with justice and international law, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.From Ugandas experience over the years, conflicts are best handled, first and foremost, by the political actors and citizens of the countries in question, following democratic principles and guided by the principle of equality of all persons before the law. In cases where national actors for some reason cannot resolve the problem, then subregional organizations should step in. In the case of Africa those include the East African Community, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), the Southern African Development Community, the Economic Community of West African States and others. The United Nations and the international community would then provide the necessary support to subregional and regional initiatives. Our recent achievements in the peace processes in Burundi, the Sudan, South Sudan and Somalia, among others, attest to the progress we can achieve by working together. The advantages of such an approach include the use of local actors who have more discerning knowledge of the problems and those in close proximity and with a greater stake in getting the problems resolved. In addition, there is the international support The continuing plight of the Palestinian people has been a source of deep distress for Afghanistan and the rest of the international community. The people of Palestine have suffered immensely for far too long. We remain in full support of the realization of the rights of our brothers and sisters in Palestine, including their right to an independent Palestinian State. The time has come for an end to the occupation and for realizing the just aspirations of the people of Palestine.Finally, reform of the United Nations remains an important item on the international agenda. Since its inception in 1945, the United Nations has exercised a key role in promoting a safer and more secure world, improving the lives of citizens worldwide, and safeguarding and promoting human rights. Nevertheless, in view of our ever-changing world, we cannot deny the fact that the Organization is in dire need of comprehensive reform, enabling it to better reflect the new challenges and realities of our time. The reform of the Security Council is long overdue. Achieving a reformed Council that is more inclusive, representative and transparent must remain a priority. We welcome the ongoing progress within the framework of the intergovernmental negotiations."}}
