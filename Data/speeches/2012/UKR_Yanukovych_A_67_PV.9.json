{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of Ukraine, I sincerely congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremic on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I wish him every success in the post and hope that all his actions bear fruit.The theme of this years debate, “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means”, is always a pressing one. That imperative was enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations by its founding members, including Ukraine. I am convinced that the fundamental principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes remains today the cornerstone of the modern system of international relations. It is the underlying mission of our Organization and the immediate duty of every Member State.Today, we are closely watching the situation in Syria, which remains extremely alarming. Ukraine shares the deep concern of the international community regarding the escalation of violence in that country. We call on all relevant parties to make every effort to settle the conflict on the basis of respect for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the universally recognized principles of international law.The people of Ukraine have never been and will never be indifferent to human suffering. We make no distinction between our grief and that of others. Last year, thanks to Ukraines humanitarian mission to Libya, people of many nationalities, mostly women and children, were evacuated and saved from hostilities. In referring to that case, we are speaking not just about one action but about Ukraines resolute intention to use its capabilities to protect civilian populations in hot spots.14 as an important milestone in the development of international cooperation under the auspices of the United Nations in that sphere. The outcome document of the Conference has proved the ability of countries of different political and economic weights to reach a compromise, even in todays difficult times.We support the complex approach that has been initiated in connection with sustainable energy for all, sustainable consumption and production, the elimination of hunger, and ensuring urban infrastructure development.Ukraine welcomes the decision of the Conference to consolidate the United Nations Environment Programme with a view to a system-based management of the whole complex spectrum of environmental problems.We deeply appreciate the establishment of a high-level political forum on sustainable development and the creation of an intergovernmental working group that will chart post-2015 sustainable development goals. That theme is of special interest for Ukraine, as demonstrated by the voluntary presentation of Ukraines national achievements with respect to the Millennium Development Goals, which took place at the Economic and Social Council in July. I avail myself of this opportunity to assure the Assembly that participation in the sustainable development efforts of the United Nations will remain Ukraines unwavering priority.Global, man-made climate change represents a threat on a planetary scale. Therefore, we consider efforts to counteract that challenge to be a priority task for humankind as a whole. Let me note that Ukraine has voluntarily acceded to the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, undertaking to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020. Bearing that in mind, Ukraine will also promote discussions, in the framework of its future OSCE chairmanship, on the environmental impact of energy-related man-made activity, energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources.Turning to international security problems, I should like to stress that Ukraine is deeply committed to the cause of bringing about a safer and more secure world. That commitment emanates from the national conscience of the people of Ukraine, who have experienced the scourge of war, totalitarianism and artificial famines, as well as the consequences of the cooperation and dialogue so as to maintain stability, resolve crisis situations and ensure post-conflict reconstruction. We will devote special attention to negotiations on the Transdniestria conflict; Ukraine has for many years actively participated in efforts to settle that conflict.We will promote in every possible way the Nagorno Karabakh settlement process, as well as the Geneva discussions on security and stability in the Caucasus.I would like to stress that Ukraine, as a non-bloc State, cannot but be concerned with the erosion of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. We consider that international legal document to be a cornerstone of stability on the continent and that therefore States parties should make every effort to ensure its fully f ledged and efficient application.Ukraine, in the framework of its OSCE chairmanship, will therefore pay special attention to the resolution of the crisis surrounding that Treaty. Peaceful settlement and conflict prevention will be the foundation and the starting point of Ukraines activities if it is elected to non-permanent membership in the Security Council for 2016-2017.At the beginning of this year, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon made public a five-year Action Agenda for the Organization. We fully support the priorities identified in the agenda and consider them a road map for United Nations activities in the near future.We are currently going through a period of unprecedented change. Unfortunately, and especially in view of the world crisis, there are global tendencies towards the stagnation of economic development, growing poverty and social inequality, and increasing instability in certain States and regions.It stands to reason that the only way to effectively counteract those threats is for the international community to deploy joint efforts. In that regard, we deem it especially advisable to increase the efficiency of international cooperation among security and law-enforcement agencies, develop best practices for addressing new challenges and threats, and introduce reliable confidence-building measures.It should be noted that this years United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) left open a number of issues, given the close interconnection of the environmental and socioeconomic aspects of modern life. However, we view the Rio+20 Conference 15Ukraine welcomes the successful completion of the General Assemblys High-level Meeting on the rule of law that took place here in New York on 24 September. At the Meeting, Ukraine announced the political obligations that we will fulfil consistently. We are certain that international efforts to ensure the rule of law should remain centred around the United Nations.At the same time, relevant international organizations should continue to play an important role in that sphere. For Ukraine, such an organization would be the Council of Europe and its Venice Commission in particular. Our close cooperation with the Council and the Commission has assisted us in making steady reforms to ensure the rule of law and thereby realize our aspirations to European integration. That process is actively promoted by Ukraines Constitutional Assembly, a special political institution established to find a nationwide consensus on the provisions of the basic law. In the course of constructing and developing Ukraines Constitution, we will study and take into account best practices from other countries.I am deeply confident that global advances in each of the crucial areas I have mentioned would be impossible without a United Nations that is more efficient, viable and updated to the realities of the twenty-first century. The key here is to deepen United Nations reform, and primarily that of the Security Council. Ukraines position is well known. We are ready to discuss all progressive concepts of Security Council reform capable of achieving the broadest possible consensus among States Members of the United Nations. The latter invariably make allowances for the legitimate requirements of all regional groups, in particular those of Eastern Europe. Only the United Nations is up to the task of strengthening humankind to face contemporary challenges. The united will of all 193 Member States represents an overwhelming force capable of coping with the most complicated global crises. We must strengthen and preserve our unity. I believe that the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly will be conducive to that noble goal."}}
