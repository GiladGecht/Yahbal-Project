{"speech":{"0":" Vanuatu wishes to associate itself with other delegations in congratulating the President and the members of his Bureau on their election to lead us through this sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I am indeed profoundly delighted, as Mr. Jeremic assured us in our meeting earlier this week, that he will do his utmost to assist with and bring to the forefront the issues that confront the Pacific island States and other marginalized nations. We trust that with his guidance, this session will conclude with successful outcomes.Allow me also to pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, who, with strong leadership and diplomatic finesse, led us to great outcomes during the sixty-sixth session of the Assembly.Our world has seen unprecedented disputes and conflicts, most of which have spanned successive 25category, the United Nations will need to ensure that proper resolutions are adopted by the General Assembly to ensure that small island States graduating from LDC status continue to enjoy certain preferential treatment, even after graduation, to offset the vulnerability factor. Let me take this opportunity to invite the members of the triennial review to visit my country to establish first-hand information and ascertain the findings of the World Risk Report prior to escalating the process of graduation in 2013.Our own experience has shown that the different ways that multilateral organizations and institutions categorize member countries can affect the f low of development assistance. For instance, Vanuatu, together with 15 other countries, was selected several years ago from among the Pacific island countries to benefit from the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) funding of the Government of the United States of America. At the time of our selection, Vanuatu was graded as a low-income country and, by the eligibility criteria of the MCC, was automatically qualified for and benefited from $66 million to build two major national roads on two different islands in the country. I wish to express our appreciation to the United States Government for its assistance.However, when the Report on Countries that are Candidates for Millennium Challenge Corporation Account Eligibility for Fiscal Year 2010 was released, Vanuatu failed to qualify. The reason was simply that the MCC was using World Bank criteria and graduated Vanuatu from the status of low-income country to that of low-middle-income country. In other words, the World Banks criteria may be totally different from the LDC criteria defined by the United Nations. I therefore wish to call on the United Nations, especially the Economic and Social Council, to ensure that the LDC definition and criteria used by United Nations agencies are compatible with those of the international financial institutions.The vast Pacific Ocean is our heritage and the prime means of livelihood of the people living in its island countries. Like other Pacific Island countries, Vanuatu continues to be exposed to and threatened by the negative impacts of climate change, such as coastal erosion, coral bleaching and ocean acidification. At the Forty-Third Pacific Islands Forum in the Cook Islands, the Forum leaders noted that many challenges remain in realizing benefits from the pledged new and additional targets of the Copenhagen Accord. In that respect, I Last year, I reiterated to this Assembly our serious concerns over the denial of a countrys right to exercise its full political freedom and inherent cultural rights over its maritime territories. Since we gained our independence 32 years ago, our territorial dispute with the French Republic over the southern two islands of Vanuatu, Matthew and Hunter, has been a reminder that we must continue to uphold the notion that the rule of law should not be used by powerful nations as an instrument to coerce weak and small nations, especially in territorial disputes.The French and the Vanuatu Governments met in Paris in April to commence dialogue on the issue of the territorially disputed islands. We take this opportunity to thank the French Government for finally opening its door to dialogue and negotiation in an attempt to resolve that outstanding international dispute. We acknowledge the procedures outlined within the United Nations to ensure that such disputes are amicably resolved.As a small island State surrounded by the vast Pacific Ocean, Vanuatu is exposed to the notorious illegal transshipment of and trade in illicit arms. The international arms trade has continuously lacked proper and coherent regulation and is responsible for the loss of innumerable lives. Like many other countries, we call on the United Nations to take a much firmer approach in expediting the conclusion of an arms trade treaty, which would provide greater security and control over such illegal activity. That is an issue of paramount importance to all countries exposed to the illegal trade in arms and light weapons.My country has consistently argued that the mechanisms and criteria for assessing graduation eligibility must not be isolated from the permanent and inherent vulnerabilities of our countries. It is unrealistic for United Nations agencies to assess progress and make projections without taking into consideration the matter of permanent vulnerabilities and the capacity to sustain growth in our countries after graduation. I wish to further state that, according to the World Risk Report 2011, Vanuatu scored highest on the World Risk Index as the country with the greatest disaster risk, due to its high exposure and weak coping capacities. The findings of that report are critical, and we therefore ask that the United Nations Committee for Development Policy carefully weigh its arguments and reassess the vulnerability graduation criteria.I would also like to state that, prior to another triennial review of the least developed country (LDC) 26 I am grateful for the opportunity to express my views in this forum. Long live our aspirations to create a better and a more secure world for everyone, and may God bless the United Nations."}}
