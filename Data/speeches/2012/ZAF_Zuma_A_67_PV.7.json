{"speech":{"0":" I thank you, sir, for the opportunity to address the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh general debate. Let me start by congratulating Mr. Vuk Jeremic and the Republic of Serbia on his election to preside over the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We also acknowledge the contribution of the President of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser.South Africa fundamentally believes in the principles and purposes contained in the Charter of the United Nations, and correctly so, given our nations history. This year, we are proudly celebrating 100 years of our peoples self less struggle for freedom, led by the African National Congress movement. We recall with great appreciation the immense contribution of the one morning unemployed because the company has gone bankrupt, while those responsible enjoy generous golden parachutes?In a time of so many old and new challenges, history has shown that paradigms have changed and that old solutions will definitely not work. We need to redefine our priorities, invest in the real economy and agree on a new and fairer world order. The African continent, having endured centuries of slavery and exploitation, cannot afford to accept yet another Trojan Horse and be duped into forfeiting its resources in a contest hobbling its progress and well-being.We call for new relations with Africa, not acting upon Africa and Africans but acting with Africa and Africans, in a spirit of cooperation and fairness, taking into account all parties priorities and interests. That is the hope we declare here in the United Nations. It is also what we call for in the relations between the New Partnership for Africas Development, on the one hand, and the Group of Eight, Group of 20 and other partnership mechanisms, on the other hand.As for Senegal, beyond the demands of democracy and good governance, about which we agree, our national priorities must more than ever focus on agriculture, infrastructure and energy. That is the only path to the progress that will improve peoples day-to-day lives, the sine qua non of development and democratization.With respect to the reform of the Security Council, Senegal reaffirms its belief in the African position expressed in the Ezulwini Consensus. It is only justice and common sense that Africa, the continent with the largest number of countries at the United Nations, and whose problems take up most of the work of the Council, should be fairly represented in that body. Indeed, the democracy required of States should also be required of the Organization to which they all belong.To conclude, on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, currently chaired by Senegal, I hope to renew our common faith in dialogue and the peaceful coexistence of religions, cultures and civilizations. Entering into dialogue and learning to live together depends on recognizing and respecting our differences as a source of richness rather than as a springboard for confrontation. It requires rejecting the defamation of religions and violence in all its forms. It demands renouncing any thought of domination by one culture or one civilization over others. It is about promoting mutual understanding in order to overcome 13act and assist, and when it comes across as paralysed in certain instances, due to the actions of some Member States. We have seen a divided Security Council unable to muster the collective courage to say “no more” to warring parties in the interest of peace. That brings to the fore the need to continue and deepen the reform of the United Nations and its organs to make it agile and nimble in addressing the contemporary challenges facing humanity.The debate on the reform of the United Nations and its organs, in particular the Security Council, has been going on for the past 18 years. However, there has been no significant movement forward. I would like to focus in particular on the Security Council. Given its mandate, the Council has to be legitimate, democratic and transparent. Its current composition has a propensity for deadlock and paralysis even in the face of crisis. It remains unrepresentative and undemocratic in both its composition and decision-making.We would like to see a more meaningful representation of Africa in the Security Council. About 70 per cent of the Councils agenda is taken up by issues from the African continent. The Security Council has to be expanded in both categories, with at least two seats for Africa in the permanent category and five in the non-permanent category. In addition to seats for the continent in the composition of the Council, the United Nations should also fully recognize and appreciate the role of regional organizations working with the United Nations in conflict management and resolution.In that regard, we urge closer collaboration with the African Union (AU) peace and security mechanisms, especially given the progress being made by the AU in conflict resolution and peacebuilding in some parts of the continent since its formation 10 years ago. Therefore, cognizance should be taken of Chapter VIII of the Charter, in particular when dealing with African issues.That is why South Africa piloted resolution 2033 (2012) during our rotating presidency of the Security Council in January.Currently, the AU continues to address one of the longest outstanding conflicts on the continent through one of its mechanisms, the African Union High-level Implementation Panel on the Sudan. Together, as the international community, we recently celebrated the creation of the State of South Sudan. We wish to congratulate the Somalis and their leadership on choosing the path of peace, democracy and prosperity. United Nations to the creation of a free and democratic South Africa.In 1966, the General Assembly labelled apartheid a crime against humanity in resolution 2202 A (XXI), which ultimately led to the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid, later known as the Apartheid Convention. The United Nations defined the crime of apartheid as “inhuman acts committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing them” (resolution 3068 (XXVIII), annex, article II). The Apartheid Convention was adopted by the General Assembly on 30 November 1973 and set the tone for vociferous action against apartheid around the world.Let me repeat the words our leader and international icon, President Nelson Mandela, uttered in his very first address to the General Assembly, in 1994, the first by a democratically elected leader and Head of State of our country. He said,“The millions of our people say ‘Thank you and ‘Thank you again, because the respect for your own dignity as human beings inspired you to act to ensure the restoration of our dignity as well.” (, p.7)The theme of this session is most appropriate as it takes us back to the basics — to the founding principles of the United Nations. The founders intended the United Nations to be the foremost multilateral forum entrusted with bringing hope, peace and order to the world. Indeed, the United Nations enjoys universal membership and is at the centre of global governance and multilateralism. The theme reminds us that peace is a choice. We can either choose peace as Member States or choose the path of conflict.The founders of the United Nations made that choice 67 years ago. They decided that the United Nations must lead the world to peace. It is important for the United Nations and its organs, especially the Security Council, to execute the Organizations mandate of working for peace without fear or favour. We must not steer away from the founding objectives of the Organization.The United Nations faces immense pressure when the world sees the unprecedented loss of lives, as it now does in Africa and the Middle East. It is of concern when it appears as if the United Nations were unable to 14 We have taken note that the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency has been able to draw the conclusion that all declared nuclear material in Iran is used for peaceful activities. Clarification of the nature of undeclared materials will enable the international community to have full confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of Irans nuclear programme. South Africa therefore encourages Iran to continue its cooperation with the Agency.We should also remember that so long as some States are allowed to operate outside internationally agreed norms, such as those of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, it will be difficult to expect others to operate within them. South Africa supports the long-standing call for a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. In that regard, the peaceful resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue is very important.Let me use this opportunity to reiterate our support for the ongoing struggle for self-determination by the people of Western Sahara. We urge the international community to support their quest for freedom, human rights and dignity.We also reiterate our call for the lifting of the economic and financial embargo against the people of Cuba in order to help the Cuban people to gain their economic freedom.Poverty, underdevelopment, lack of opportunities and competition for scarce resources contribute to some of the conflicts in the developing world, including Africa. Therefore, the promotion of sustainable development and the fight against poverty cannot be divorced from the quest for peace.In 2015, the United Nations will be 70 years old and will also reach the target year for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). World leaders committed themselves to eradicating extreme poverty, facilitating universal primary education, attaining gender equality, improving maternal and child health, reducing the burden of disease primarily by combating HIAIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, protecting the environment, and mobilizing global partnerships for development by 2015. The Heads of State also committed themselves to promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women as effective ways to combat poverty, hunger and disease and to stimulate truly sustainable development. We urge the United Nations to continue promoting the achievement The international community and the United Nations must continue to give the people of Somalia all the necessary support.Africa is indeed making progress and, with United Nations support, that could go further. To promote the peaceful settlement of disputes, we also wish to emphasize that the Security Council should carry out its Charter mandate within the confines of international law.Any Member State or international body that implements Council resolutions should be accountable to the Council, so as to ensure that we avoid the abuse of internationally agreed principles such as the responsibility to protect and the protection of civilians. Those principles must not be used, amongst other things, to justify the notion of regime change. They exist to prevent mass atrocities, war crimes, genocide and ethnic cleansing.We should continue the debate on them in order to develop norms and standards for accountability when actions are taken.It is also of critical importance for the United Nations to closely guard its impartiality, independence and objectivity and not allow itself to be dragged into a conflict to take sides with any party under the guise of protecting civilians.The situation in the Middle East, in particular the Palestine-Israeli question, continues to be of concern to us. The United Nations should play a central and decisive role in efforts to resolve the long-standing conflict in that region. Any act of aggression or violations of international law should be condemned unequivocally by the United Nations at all times. As the United Nations, we cannot be seen to be strong in condemning some acts while being soft on others. As South Africa, we remain committed to the two-State solution based on the 1967 borders, with Palestine and Israel coexisting side by side in peace.Let me also emphasize that South Africa fully supports the application by Palestine for full membership of the United Nations. It is unacceptable that, even today, Palestine remains outside the membership of the United Nations. We trust that that matter will soon be positively concluded.In further promotion of the peaceful resolution of disputes, we believe that the sovereign right of States to nuclear energy for peaceful and civilian use should be respected in accordance with international law. 15Todays timely debate is a reminder that, ultimately, peace is a choice. Peace is achievable. The wise and brave choices we have the power to make can deliver lasting peace to every corner of the world. We are called upon at this sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly to choose peace by reforming and strengthening the United Nations so that it can play its rightful role and deliver peace, security, sustainable development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world. As the foremost multilateral forum bringing together all nations of the world, the United Nations is best placed to play this role. It requires our support as Member States at all times, both for our sake and for that of future generations."}}
