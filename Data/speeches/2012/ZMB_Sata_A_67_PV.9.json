{"speech":{"0":" I am greatly honoured to deliver my inaugural address to the General Assembly. Allow me to begin by congratulating the President on his election to oversee the sixty-seventh session of the Assembly, and to wish him every success in his position. His great country, Serbia, has historically enjoyed close ties with Zambia. We are therefore delighted to see him in that important seat.I would also like to thank His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the steady manner in which he has continued to steer our global Organization. In Zambia we are particularly appreciative that, despite his busy schedule, the Secretary-General made time to visit our country earlier this year to undertake some important programmes.About a year ago, I ended my decade-long career as an opposition politician when the people of Zambia overwhelmingly chose to change their political leadership through a democratic and peaceful electoral transition that ushered me into office as the fifth President of the Republic. I am indebted to the people of Zambia for once again undertaking that process in a peaceful manner.It is my desire to utilize my experience at both ends of the leadership spectrum to make a worthwhile contribution to our democracy. I trust that Zambia will be able to share its lessons, as well as to learn from those with longer and even better democratic experiences.As the Assembly is aware, we still face considerable challenges with respect to meeting the basic needs of the majority of the Zambian people. Shortly before I took office, there was much publicity about our positive 8 the infrastructure and to human capital development. Despite those efforts, however, 60.5 per cent of the Zambian people continue to live in poverty.My Government attaches similar importance to promoting good governance. As such, we have put in place a robust anti-corruption programme with improved and increased resources, which should set a new stage for our development. In addition, for the first time, Zambia has entrusted the governance of our legislative and judicial institutions to our women. The Inspector-General of Police, the Chief Justice and the Deputy Chief Justice, the chair of the anti-corruption commission and the commissioner of the drug enforcement commission are all women. I remain convinced that they will improve our record and surpass the nations expectations.Our national programmes are also focused on creating employment for our youth. Despite our vast natural resources, unemployment continues to be the most pressing problem for the younger generation. We are therefore looking to improve partnership with the various United Nations agencies and the rest of the international community to harness best practices from across the world. After all, it is the youth of 2012 who have made Zambia the African football champion.Our Government has recognized that without the rule of law, social justice and an independent judicial system Zambia will not be able to attain sustainable social and economic development. As an initial step in that regard, our Government is currently undertaking a constitutional review process that is intended to ensure the primacy of the individual citizen and his liberties. We further wish to speed up the process of domesticating the international conventions that seek to bridge the gaps for minorities. Special emphasis will also be placed on improving the treatment of people with mental and physical challenges.Zambia participated in the process leading to the Rio+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. Over the years, we have learned to appreciate the transboundary nature of matters such as our common environment. I would like to express appreciation to the Government of Brazil, the Chair of the Conference and all who made tremendous efforts to bring about the final outcome document of that historic conference. We are concerned, however, that as States Members of the United Nations we missed the opportunity to develop a formidable international macroeconomic indicators, but those results did not trickle down to the average citizen.In the quest to develop at the micro level, the focus of my new Government is on enhancing agricultural productivity and access to markets for peasants and small-scale farmers, providing improved health services as close to the families as possible, improving the quality of education and facilitating access to decent housing and accommodation.As we draw closer to the 2015 deadline for meeting the Millennium Development Goals, the international community needs to maximize its efforts towards achieving all eight goals. Zambia has made steady progress in achieving some of them.That is most visible in the education sector, which has seen an increase in the net enrolment of children in primary schools, while the health sector has seen reductions in the prevalence of HIAIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.Notwithstanding our progress in tackling communicable diseases, Zambia is also attempting to address non-communicable diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and cancer.While still considering matters related to the health sector, allow me to mention that my Government recently reviewed statistics that indicate that Zambia now has the second-highest rate of cervical cancer in the world. From 22 to 24 July, our capital, Lusaka, hosted the sixth annual Stop Cervical Cancer in Africa Conference, made up by the Forum of African First Ladies against Breast and Cervical Cancer and the African Parliamentarians and Health Ministers against Cancer. Just last year, former United States President George W. Bush travelled to Lusaka to launch the Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon campaign against breast and cervical cancer. He has since facilitated some generous contributions for the facilities now in place to fight the diseases. I would like to express the Zambian peoples deep appreciation for all those efforts. However, the challenges in the health sector and elsewhere do not end there, and by no means have we stood by with folded arms.Since my Government assumed power, in September 2011, our country has seen reasonable improvements in our economy, with an inflation rate that is down to 6.6 per cent and a gross domestic product growth rate of about 6 per cent, in spite of slow global economic trends. That has been attributed to enhancement of the investment policy framework and to improvement of 9and we need only look at the sovereign representation in this Hall to prove that.It is therefore imperative that ongoing efforts to reform the United Nations be approached with renewed vigour. We are concerned that a seemingly difficult deadlock has been created in the reform process of the United Nations.In addition, I wish to reiterate that despite the slow process of the reform of the Security Council, Africa should not relent or become frustrated. We should stand up and be counted. As enshrined in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, Africa must be given two permanent seats with a veto immediately exercisable and two non-permanent seats to correct the historical injustice that the continent has suffered and also adhere to the geopolitical realities of modern times. Furthermore, the Council should improve its working methods.I wish to appeal to all nations to renew their commitment and to strive for new common ground where individual national interests take a back seat. Just as many international conventions have been subject to innovative translations in the recent past, we must plan to be as f lexible in creating a new United Nations, sooner rather than later. To ignore this need for transformation would be tantamount to killing the Organization."}}
