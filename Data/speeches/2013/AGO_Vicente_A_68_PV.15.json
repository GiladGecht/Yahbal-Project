{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of the President of the Republic of Angola, His Excellency Mr. Jose Eduardo dos Santos, whom I have the honour to represent before the Assembly, allow me to congratulate Ambassador John William Ashe on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and to assure him of my countrys support in the fulfilment of that important and noble mission. I would also like to express our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremic for the effective manner in which he conducted the work of the previous session, and we salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his continued dedication to the cause of our Organization.This session of the General Assembly is taking place in a complex international climate, one where the intervention of the international community is needed to provide lasting solutions to conflicts that constitute serious threats to international peace and security. The prevalence of armed conflicts and their impact on populations, terrorism, organized crime and drug trafficking, maritime piracy, environmental crimes and looting of resources, as well as extreme poverty, deprivation and hunger are issues that require priority attention from our Organization. Angola reiterates the importance of the role of the United Nations as a driving force behind global efforts to maintain peace, stability and economic and social development, and it is therefore important to strengthen its capacity for conflict prevention and crisis management.My country will continue to contribute actively in peacekeeping efforts, assuming responsibilities at the international level, in particular with regard to Africa, as well as in the regional framework and the economic and political groups it is a part of, including the Southern African Development Community, the Economic Community of Central African States, the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and the Gulf of Guinea Commission.In that context, the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region, signed in February in Addis Ababa, is both the most appropriate mechanism for the peaceful resolution of the conflict in the eastern Democratic in Agenda 21, the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development provided a sound basis for policy-making at the national and international levels and for ensuring the social, economic and environmental welfare of our peoples. To that end, we reiterate that it is essential to take appropriate measures to strengthen international support for actions in support of sustainable development, as well as to increase the financial resources of the United Nations budget through contributions so as to enable the Organization to fulfil its mandate efficiently and make sustainable development a reality.On another topic, the embargo against Cuba violates the rules of international law and has for decades been a major impediment to the development of that country and to the improvement of the living conditions of the Cuban people. Angola reiterates its position of principle that, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations, the embargo should be brought to an end.Angola reiterates its belief in mutual respect and mutual benefit, good neighbourliness and the strengthening of regional economic integration. Angola will continue to respect all international commitments and treaties to which it is a party. We respect and implement the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Constitutional Act of the African Union, and we establish relations based on the principles of self-determination, the peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for human rights.Currently, Angola is experiencing a period of consolidation in its democratic institutions and the rule of law. There has also been a dynamic process of reconstruction and development marked by the consolidation of macroeconomic stability through the implementation of a national policy and strategy for the promotion of economic diversification contained in our economic and social development plan for the period 2013-2017.By agreeing to join the programme of countries eligible to graduate from the least developed country category, Angola reaffirms its priority to implement a programme of diversification of its domestic production aimed at achieving balanced growth in various sectors, expanding employment opportunities and decreasing its dependence on imports of consumer products and its high dependence on oil sector exports.have successfully held free and fair elections and are now making strides towards building democratic States, establishing the rule of law and promoting economic and social development. In that connection, we welcome the democratic election of President Ibrahim Keita in Mali and express our solidarity with the process of reconciliation and reconstruction of the country. We also congratulate those countries that have shown positive developments and that despite unstable situations are working to implement agreements aimed at resolving crises and normalizing their constitutional frameworks. They include Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Somalia, the Sudan and South Sudan. We call for the entire international community to support the efforts those countries are making to achieve peace and stability.Six years after the onset of the international financial crisis, with its grave repercussions for the world economy, many countries are experiencing serious difficulties in financing programmes for economic growth and mobilizing resources for development aimed at improving living conditions and meeting the Millennium Development Goals. That situation is even more problematic for developing countries, particularly in Africa, where armed conflict and poverty frequently coincide.In that context, the Angolan Government believes that it is essential that we consider “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”, the theme of this session of the General Assembly, in the hope that it will contribute effectively to the economic and social development of developing countries. The Angolan Government is of the view that during this session the Assembly should consider holding regional meetings based on the report of the High-level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through Sustainable Development, in which various leaders could define their positions on the post-2015 agenda from a regional perspective, and which could be followed by another meeting at the global level. In that regard, the Government of Angola reiterates its support for initiatives aimed at liberalizing international trade so as to promote fair and balanced competition, and we hope that the ninth World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference, scheduled to take place in Bali in December, will lead to the best results.Environmental challenges persist. By renewing the commitments to sustainable development contained of Honduras, and inviting her to address the General Assembly.Mrs. De Bogran (Honduras) (spoke in Spanish): The Government of Honduras extends its warmest congratulations to Mr. Ashe on his election to preside over the proceedings of the General Assembly, and we wish him every success.I am grateful for the honour that the President of Honduras conferred upon me by asking me to represent him in this world forum. As we come to the close of our term in office, we in the Administration of President Porfirio Lobo Sosa note with satisfaction that we have laid the foundation for national unity and reconciliation. We have successfully overcome the severe political crisis that affected Honduras during the previous Government, and Honduras now looks forward to new general elections in November.The Government of President Lobo Sosa has normalized relations with the international community. We have secured ties of close cooperation with more than a hundred friendly countries, restored foreign credit and shown the world that we are a country that lives up to its democratic and peaceful calling. Today, Honduras is a member of the principal international and regional organizations. Our membership in major forums has given us access to new markets, opportunities for investment and employment and helped to strengthen our energy sector.As part of the process of unity and reconciliation, the President of the Republic created a Government of National Integration, with the participation of all the political parties that took part in the last electoral process. Fortunately, that participation continues today and will continue through the end of the present constitutional term. Accordingly, I wish to mention that, as part of the process of healing the wounds of the 2009 political crisis and building the future together, we have successfully adopted by consensus a long-term country vision and a national plan from which our Government programme is derived. That shared vision is being implemented through a major national agreement for economic growth with social equity between the Government of President Lobo Sosa, trade unions, business owners, workers, farmers and civil society. I believe that Honduras and the world should welcome those efforts, together with the spirit of dialogue and commitment of all sectors of Honduran society, which have shown that collective interests come well before individual interests.Despite progress made in the past decade and the fact that the Angolan economy is on the right path, much remains to be done in order to fulfil the Millennium Development Goals. Aware of that challenge, the Government continues to develop programmes aimed at reducing social inequality, while pursuing the fight against hunger and poverty as two crucial elements for building a prosperous society and attaining social justice. Furthermore, rehabilitating and upgrading the main productive and social infrastructure, including the reconstruction of roads and railways, electricity and water supply and distribution systems, and sanitation and telecommunication networks, continue to be a challenge for the Government in its quest to improve the well-being of the population and attain sustainable development in Angola.I would like to conclude by referring to an issue of particular importance for the Government of my country. The Republic of Angola is a candidate for non-permanent-member status in the Security Council, with elections to be held at the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We hope we can count on the support of all the States that make up the Assembly.I will finish by expressing my countrys unconditional support for the initiatives of the United Nations aimed at building a better world for all, based on justice and freedom, free from all threats that endanger international peace and security."}}
