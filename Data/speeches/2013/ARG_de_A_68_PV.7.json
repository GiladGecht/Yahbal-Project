{"speech":{"0":" The world is constantly changing and the pace of change is increasing every year. The world is a very different place today compared to 10 years ago when the Millennium Development Goals were set. But it is important to understand the nature of the changes and to draw the right conclusions, because only then will we be able to have an influence and shape our own future.We are seeing the fastest reduction in poverty in human history. Child death rates have fallen, meaning that 14,000 fewer children are dying every day. Deaths from malaria and tuberculosis are decreasing. New HIV infections are declining. People are living longer. One hundred years ago, the average life expectancy in Sweden was less than 60 years. Today, many children born in my country will live to celebrate their 100th birthday. Those are truly amazing developments.The world economy is growing. This year, developing and emerging countries share of the world economy will surpass the share of developed countries. In 10 years time, they will dominate the growing world economy.We see the same pattern in expanding global trade f lows. The share of developing countries exports has grown substantially and now accounts for almost half of all exports in the world. That creates jobs and growth for everyone and increases global equality. Technological change is also rapid. Seeking information from the other side of the globe is now part of everyday life for many people, not only for the privileged few. As an example, the number of mobile phone users has risen from fewers than 1 billion to more than 6 billion. But challenges are still abundant, and it is crucial that we intensify our efforts to achieve the existing Millennium Development Goals.Sweden continues to contribute 1 per cent of its gross national income to official development assistance. Sweden is a firm believer in multilateral organizations, in international cooperation and in the United Nations. The United Nations plays a key role in coordinating our efforts towards the Millennium Development Goals. We believe that together we can become hopeful instead of helpless. Therefore, Sweden contributes approximately $1.2 billion yearly to the United Nations system. That makes us the second biggest contributor per capita to urgent need for a political solution to the conflict and a transition to a free and democratic Syria.It is time for a new era in which countries in conflict can join the rest of the world in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. For that, we need a strong United Nations and a well-functioning Security Council.I want to thank all peacekeepers and peacebuilders of the United Nations for their efforts and sacrifices. Sweden will further contribute to and participate in those efforts. We also give strong support to the areas of democracy, human rights and freedom from violence. Sweden is one of biggest donors to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. We are trying to help out though humanitarian assistance for the crisis in Syria and by receiving refugees. This year alone we have welcomed 16,000 Syrians to Sweden.Let me mention a third area that we need to focus on in the post-2015 development agenda, namely, trade and competition. Protectionism is very expensive. It raises prices and lowers standards of living. Let me illustrate this by a striking example. According to the World Trade Organization, consumers and Governments in rich countries pay $350 billion per year supporting agriculture. That is enough to f ly their 41 million dairy cows first class around the world.Allow me to mention some other, maybe more down-to-earth, examples. When competition was introduced for mobile phone companies in some countries, the cost of calls fell by 30 to 50 per cent. Studies show that lowering service barriers by one third under the Doha Development Agenda would raise developing countries incomes by approximately $60 billion. Unfortunately, progress in the Doha Development Round has been slow. But the good news is that many countries are doing what they can to liberalize trade through regional agreements instead, because they know that that will benefit their economies.The two free trade agreements now being negotiated — between the United States and the European Union and between the United States and a number of countries in Asia and Latin America — will cover two-thirds of world trade. That will create jobs and growth. Sweden is one of the countries within the European Union working the hardest to get the transatlantic deal in place. Freer trade and openness also mean that new impulses and trends affect a country faster. That puts pressure on reform in countries and the public good and to less corruption. The inclusion of women in peace processes makes peace easier and more stable. Let me be very clear: it is simply neither acceptable nor very smart to discriminate against women and girls.To achieve sustainable development, we need a democratic governance that encompasses all individuals. We need a system that covers not only the State, but also the private sector and civil society organizations. We need a governing system that is accountable and transparent with regard to its actions. Nevertheless, nearly one third of the worlds population lives under authoritarian rule, a serious barrier to development. With the growing economic power in many developing countries comes an opportunity and a responsibility to use that power wisely and for the common good of everyone. Every persons human rights must be respected, regardless of origin, religion, handicap, gender, sexual preference or transsexual identity. Only then will society reap the benefits of all human resources. Only when people can freely express their political opinions and freely participate in a thriving civil society can they truly participate in the lives of their communities. That also applies to freedom on the Internet. Only with functioning courts do people feel safe to make investments and develop their businesses. Only with respect for the rule of law can we tackle organized crime and corruption. Only with democratic principles can we ensure freedom from conflict and violence.Violence and oppression in all their forms are among the main threats to the development of people and the development of societies. We know that it takes, on average, seven years to fight a civil war, and 17 years to recover from a war. That is why conflict is sometimes called “development in reverse”. As we speak, there are several major ongoing conflicts, resulting in death and suffering, hunger and disease, and rape and sexual violence. Those conflicts are depriving men, women and children of their right to a prosperous life and a future of hope. A focus on fragile States will remain necessary.The civil war raging in Syria for more than two years must come to an end. Those responsible for systematic violations of human rights, including those responsible for the use of chemical weapons, must be held accountable. The conflict must, however, be handled within the United Nations system. There is an The international structures we have to deal with climate change commitments are unfortunately obsolete. We need a new agreement that ensures that all major emitters make commitments that are sufficient so that we can reach the two-degree target.It is our duty to strive for a society and a world that gives everybody the possibility to create his or her own future. That is what every woman, every man, every girl and every boy deserves. Let me underline that it is in the very interests of every country, because people are the real wealth of a nation. The Millennium Development Goals have been very successful in coordinating and focusing our efforts on the areas where progress has been most urgent. Now we need to prepare for tomorrow. In doing that, Sweden is convinced, the United Nations will play a very important role. We will continue our strong support to the Organization."}}
