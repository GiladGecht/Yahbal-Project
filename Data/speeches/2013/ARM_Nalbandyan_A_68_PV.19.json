{"speech":{"0":" I would like to join previous speakers in congratulating Mr. John William Ashe on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and to thank the outgoing President, Mr. Vuk Jeremic.During the past two decades, the international community has made great strides towards the development of a cohesive approach aimed at addressing the political, social and economic challenges that the international community is facing today. We need to analyse our commitments, keeping in mind the difficulties that we have encountered while the three permanent members of the Security Council, have never made another reference to those resolutions.Azerbaijan is acting as if the international community shared its approach and as if it shared the approach of the international community. In reality, Azerbaijan continuously rejects all proposals of the internationally mandated OSCE Minsk Group co-Chair countries. Baku has rejected all versions of the Basic Principles of the settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict proposed by the co-Chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group, including those presented at the Kazan, Sochi, Astrakhan and Saint Petersburg summits. Baku refuses not only the Basic Principles, but also the confidence-building measures proposed by the co-Chairs on consolidation of the ceasefire, withdrawal of the snipers from the line of contact and the establishment of a mechanism for investigating ceasefire violations. Azerbaijan not only obstructs confidence-building measures, but also periodically organizes provocations on the line of contact with Nagorno Karabakh and on the border with Armenia, which has resulted in new casualties.At the previous session of the General Assembly (see ), I spoke about the Azerbaijani leaderships release and glorification of an axe-murderer named Ramil Safarov, which was strongly condemned by the entire international community and by the human rights commissions of the United Nations and other international organizations. Even today, more than a year after Safarovs release, the Azerbaijani leadership continues to declare that what they did is just and right and dares to criticize the stance of the international community. That clearly demonstrates the deepening gap between the Azerbaijani leadership and the international community in terms of perceptions of what is good and what is bad.Most recently, Azerbaijani authorities at the national level have ostracized the eminent Azerbaijani writer Akram Aylisli for publishing a novel in which he talks about the pogroms against Armenians in Baku, Sumgait and other parts of Azerbaijan. Aylislis books were publicly burned, and the writer had to leave the country after receiving death threats.Just last week the Azerbaijani leadership once again came up with new threats against Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh and made claims to Armenian territories, including its nearly 3,000-year-old capital city, Yerevan. Notwithstanding Azerbaijans destructive (OSCE) — Russia, United States and France — made a new statement on Nagorno Karabakh in the framework of the Group of Eight Summit in Enniskillen. In Armenia, we welcomed that statement and affirmed that, like the co-Chairs, we continued to believe that the elements outlined in the statements of the Heads of State of the co-Chair countries over the past five years can form the basis for reaching a fair and lasting settlement of the conflict. We share the position of the co-Chair countries that those elements should be seen as an integrated whole and that any attempt to select some elements over others would make it impossible to achieve a solution. We absolutely agree that peoples should be prepared for peace, not war. Unfortunately, to date the Azerbaijani leadership has been doing just the opposite, increasing warmongering and anti-Armenian hate speech on a daily basis, even using the lofty rostrum of the United Nations for its purposes.We absolutely agree with the Heads of the three co-Chair countries — which are also three permanent members of the Security Council — that the use of force will not resolve the conflict and that only a negotiated settlement can lead to peace and stability. However, through its unprecedented accumulation of offensive weaponry at a massive scale, Azerbaijan seriously endangers regional and international security, despite its membership in the Security Council.Unlike Azerbaijan, Armenia has on several occasions reiterated its commitment to the principles of international law and, in response to the Enniskillen appeal of the Presidents of the United States, the Russian Federation and France, once again reaffirmed that commitment, particularly with respect to the non-use of force or the threat of force, equal rights and the self-determination of peoples and territorial integrity.Azerbaijan keeps misinterpreting the 1993 resolutions of the Security Council — resolutions 822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993) — the core requirement of which was the immediate cessation of all hostilities and hostile acts and the establishment of a durable ceasefire. Azerbaijan has not only failed to comply with the latter requirement, but further intensified its aggression and the military operations against Nagorno Karabakh and Armenia using mercenaries closely linked to notorious terrorist organizations. It is not surprising that since the ceasefire agreement was signed in 1994, the mediators, congratulations to the President on the occasion of his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I am convinced that he will spare no effort to strengthen the gains made and to firmly establish international peace and security, so as to create an international system in which all of mankind enjoys well-being, stability and progress. The Presidents experience and political skills in heading his countrys Mission for over a decade are also factors that make him a natural leader during this session.I should also like to praise the efforts of his predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremic, and commend him for his interest in the problems of the African continent and his efforts to strengthen the principle of dialogue as an effective tool for consultation and the role of the rule of law and good governance.I would also like to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his unflagging efforts in the service of international peace and security and his focus on climate change issues and the fight against famine and deadly diseases, as well as on realizing the Millennium Development Goals.Last June, in the important speech that the President delivered to the General Assembly on the occasion of his election to preside over the sixty-eighth session (see ), he outlined his ambitious programme of action, which takes into account the participation of women, youth and civil society in the post-2015 development agenda, the role of South-South cooperation, the role of human rights and the rule of law, and the role of information technology and communication in the proposed development agenda. Those are important topics, and we thank him for including them.Over the past two decades — in step with the Human Development Report — some developing countries have experienced substantial economic change. However, the majority of developing countries, especially the least developed ones, remain very far from achieving the Millennium Development Goals. On the threshold of 2015, it behoves us today to implement plans and programmes that take into consideration the failures of the past and the challenges of the future and to effectively prepare the post-2015 development agenda. In that regard, we call upon the wealthy countries of the world to live up to their promises regarding the financing of development programmes in those developing countries that have such pressing needs. stance, Armenia will continue to make efforts towards the settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict exclusively through peaceful means and on the basis of the purposes and principles and norms set forth in the United Nations Charter and the provisions of the statements made by the Presidents of the three co-Chair countries at LAquila, Muskoka, Deauville, Los Cabos and Enniskillen.In March, the Human Rights Council adopted by consensus a resolution initiated by Armenia and co-sponsored by over 60 countries on the prevention of genocide. The recognition, condemnation and prevention of genocide remain a priority for Armenia, and we will take the necessary actions to prevent new occurrences of the crime of genocide, while keeping the issue of responsibility for crimes against humanity and the denial thereof high on its agenda. As the nation that survived the first genocide of the twentieth century, Armenia unequivocally welcomes the clear position adopted by the States Members of the United Nations that precludes any possibility of immunity or pardon for perpetrators of crimes against humanity.In May 2013, Armenia assumed the chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, a regional organization that is a key partner of the United Nations in our shared global quest to advance the principles of fundamental freedoms, the defence and promotion of human rights and the continuous efforts for peace and security.Cooperation between the two organizations is also well established in the fight against racism, xenophobia, hate speech and intolerance. Those issues are also among the priorities established during Armenias chairmanship, elaborated in response to the challenges that Member States of both the United Nations and the Council of Europe are facing today.Armenia is committed to strengthening the institutional capacities of the United Nations. In that regard, we support the United Nations reform process and are ready to contribute to it. We believe that the reforms provide an opportunity to enhance the role of the Organization in addressing the crucial issues facing the world."}}
