{"speech":{"0":" As a freshly minted Foreign Minister, I am delighted to take part in this general debate. Only a few weeks ago, Australia held national elections and chose a new Government. Only nine days ago, I was sworn in as Australias thirty-eighth Minister for Foreign Affairs. A change of Government is a significant national decision. It has happened only seven times in our country since the Second World War.Australia is an open, liberal democracy. We recognize our good fortune in having an unbroken record of peaceful democratic transition stretching back to 1901. The United Nations offers that same ideal of peace and order in relations among States. It gives us a place to resolve our differences and to be heard on the concerns that matter most.There is an intrinsic connection between the security and stability of Governments and economic development. Good Governments understand that providing a secure and stable environment for their citizens is their most fundamental task, but that task is tied inextricably to the strength of their economy. Economic growth, development and trade are the key drivers of national and international prosperity, and a vital support for global security. That is why the new Australian Government will put economic diplomacy at the centre of our foreign policy.We will promote responsible economic governance and open trading systems that support export-oriented economies. We recognize that a strong business sector, open trading rules and liberal foreign investment policies can foster economic growth and, with it, opportunities to achieve prosperity and security. Strong economies give nations and their people an environment in which to build their lives — to make choices for the lives they The situation in Syria is an urgent security and humanitarian crisis we must address. Left unchecked, it will continue to cause great human suffering and further destabilize the region. Along with the rest of the world, Australia has condemned the horrific chemical weapons attack on 21 August, as we have condemned the Al-Assad regimes use of conventional weapons against its own people.The first obligation of any Government is to protect its own citizens. In 2005, leaders of all States Members of the United Nations signed on to this principle in the World Summit Outcome on the responsibility to protect (resolution ). Australia, as current President of the Security Council, will therefore co-sponsor a draft resolution before the Council that condemns in the strongest terms any use of chemical weapons. The draft resolution will make clear, for the first time, that the use of chemical weapons is a threat to international peace and security, and in doing so set a new international norm that will help to deter future use. It will say that those responsible for using such weapons must be brought to justice — a call we strongly endorse.We welcome the fact that draft resolution sets out in no uncertain terms that the Al-Assad regime must comply fully with the requirement to destroy its chemical weapons. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons now needs strong international support for its role in the destruction of Syrias chemical weapons.Australia will also continue to press for the Council to take action to assist the humanitarian effort in Syria and, of course, provide our full backing to efforts to find a political solution in accordance with the Geneva communique (, annex) that leads to a cessation of violence and a political transition which meets the aspirations of all Syrians.But we cannot just focus on a single instance of global security, for we are engaged on security challenges around the world, including in the Indo-Pacific region. Through our Security Council membership, we draw on lessons learned from our experience in peacekeeping and peacebuilding and take forward initiatives that are meaningful to our region. We welcome the strong support which the Security Council gave yesterday to Australias resolution 2117 (2013) on small arms and light weapons. These weapons are a major driver of many conflicts that are brought to the attention of the Council.There is a role for aid in helping to overcome the obstacles to investment. It must attract, but should never replace, private-sector capital. The returns are high. A joint report of the World Trade Organization and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that every dollar invested in aid-for-trade can lift exports from developing countries by $8.We firmly believe that the economic growth of developing countries can be unlocked through trade. Australia will continue to promote trade liberalization through the World Trade Organization, through regional and sector-specific deals, and through bilateral free trade negotiations. The Australian Government aims to build a network of bilateral and regional free-trade agreements. We will work in the World Trade Organization to rebuild the multilateral trading agenda. Australia puts the highest priority on global economic reform and trade liberalization as the best way to secure jobs and economic growth. These will be key themes for us as we chair the Group of 20 in 2014.No one should pretend that the economic sphere exists in isolation from other parts of our human experience. Economic progress alone is not sufficient. We need to ensure that all people around the world are free to fully exercise their economic, civil and political rights. Australia was one of eight nations involved in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in 1948 the Australian President of the General Assembly, our Foreign Minister Mr. H. V. Evatt, oversaw the adoption of the Declaration (see 3).Since then, Australia has been at the forefront of defending human rights globally and regionally in support of equality and fundamental freedoms — freedom from discrimination; freedom from slavery, torture, arbitrary arrest, detention or exile; freedom of speech, conscience and religion; freedom to work, to enjoy health and education and to participate in the life of the community. Importantly, these freedoms must extend to all women and girls, including through equal access to employment, resources, education and health services, and they must be underpinned by robust and independent legal systems to enforce economic, social and political rights.Australia will continue to promote and protect human rights standards around the world. That is why we are seeking membership of the Human Rights Council for the 2018-2020 term. that underpins and supports international peace and security."}}
