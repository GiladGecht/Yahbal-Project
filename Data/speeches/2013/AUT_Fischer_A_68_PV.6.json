{"speech":{"0":" I thank the President for raising for discussion at this years general debate a very pertinent subject, namely, “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. Shaping our planets future after 2015 is indeed a crucial task ahead of us, as Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon described very impressively in his presentation this morning (see ). While we remain fully committed to the full implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, the post-2015 agenda has started.One idea that has caught my particular attention is to upgrade the eradication of hunger from an indictor to a goal in that new agenda. More still needs to be done, and everyone must contribute a fair share: States, international organizations, the private sector, academia and civil society alike. Let me assure the Assembly that Austria will contribute its share as well.The international community currently faces major threats in its search for global security. The Middle East remains exposed to fundamental challenges. We welcome the agreement reached between the United States and the Russian Federation on a framework for the destruction of the Syrian chemical weapons arsenal. We believe that the Security Council should refer the While some might believe that there is a contradiction between respect for cultural and religious differences on the one hand and the universality of human rights on the other, I am convinced that they reinforce each other. If people and nations can count on human rights being protected, they will show respect for the other side.The Human Rights Council, with its universal periodic review mechanism and special procedures, has, within a few years, developed into an effective instrument to address human rights violations and crisis situations in many instances. Austria, as a current member of the Council, is contributing to those efforts with targeted initiatives for the safety of journalists, the protection of religious minorities and the promotion of the rights of the child. We welcome the continuing trend towards the universal abolition of the death penalty, which is a longstanding interest of mine. However, too many countries still maintain a retentionist policy with regard to that cruel and inhuman form of punishment. Our diplomatic efforts therefore have to be reinforced.We are worried by the increasing number of human rights violations based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna and the 2005 World Summit firmly placed human rights at the centre of United Nations activities. Respect for human rights is an indispensable prerequisite for peace, security and development.Last year, the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Rule of Law provided an excellent opportunity for us to renew our commitment to the rule of law at the national and international levels. The Austrian Government is considering setting up an Austrian rule-of-law trust fund, designed to support international actors in strengthening the rule of law and to offer legal expertise and deploy legal experts free of charge to developing countries, at their request. International law and the rule of law are the foundations of the international system. Austria strongly believes that only an international system based on the rule of law can lead to lasting peace, security, economic development and social progress. Obviously, that is particularly true for the use of force, which should occur only in self-defence or when authorized by the Security Council.In that spirit, let me confirm that Austria remains fully committed to an effective United Nations system. Austria is also the host country of the newly established International Anti-Corruption Academy. This international organization and centre of excellence has already undertaken several successful activities in fighting corruption — a major obstacle to reasonable development in all areas of society. I thank the Kingdom of Thailand for hosting the second Assembly of Parties, scheduled to take place in December. Furthermore, I would like to invite all States that have not yet done so to become members of the Anti-Corruption Academy.This years Forum of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations took place in Vienna in February, with the forward-looking theme of “Responsible leadership in diversity and dialogue”. More than 1,500 participants from Government, civil society, the private sector and the media, as well as a youth forum of 150 outstanding and highly dedicated participants, provided most valuable input for the discussions of the Forum.In that context, I am also pleased to report that the King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz International Centre for Interreligious and Intercultural Dialogue was inaugurated in Vienna on 26 November 2012. The Centre — a joint initiative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Austria — serves as an interactive platform for religious leaders, experts and civil society alike.Multilateral cooperation can deliver solutions to global problems. The historic accomplishment of the Arms Trade Treaty is an important example in that regard. We look forward to its earliest possible entry into force. At the same time, the international disarmament and non-proliferation regime is being challenged, day after day, by alarming developments. We were, and still are, deeply shocked by the use of chemical weapons in Syria. We observe North Koreas continued development of nuclear weapons and missile capabilities with concern. And we have new hope that the Iranian nuclear issue will be resolved by negotiations, which, after the election of a new Iranian President, should be resumed shortly.Similarly, the continued reliance on nuclear weapons and the limited progress towards nuclear disarmament are of great global concern. Nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation efforts can be achieved only when they go forward together. Nuclear weapons should be stigmatized, banned and eliminated. The humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons have to be put at the centre of our attention. process, whereby the will of the people honoured me with the highest office of our Republic. Those events also represent the conclusion of a long transition towards democracy in Paraguay. For the second, time in our history, executive authority was consecutively transferred from one political party to another with full respect for the constitutional framework. That is no small achievement in our 202 years of independence, and it signals the true beginning of a new historic and auspicious period for my country.Republican institutionalism, the building of consensus, the strengthening of the democratic system, unconditional respect for human rights, and freedom of speech and of the press are the cornerstones of my Government, which aims to be an exemplar of patriotism, honesty, inclusion and effectiveness, with the capacity needed to propel Paraguay towards its destined greatness.The people of Paraguay have been waiting for a great Government for a long time. I hope to be able to deliver on that great vision, which will position my country firmly on the global stage, where we want to stand out by ensuring that we are a land of opportunity for Paraguayans and foreigners alike. As has been said, Paraguay is one of the most closely guarded treasures of Latin America, and there are good reasons to hope that it will have a promising future.I have made combating poverty a priority for my Government. It is incomprehensible that a nation so rich in resources should have so many poor. We will give no quarter in the fight to reduce our poverty indicators as much and as quickly as possible. Change is coming, and not through aid but by ensuring human dignity. Social investment is at the forefront of my Administrations agenda. That is the new direction we want to take in my country, with investment that is for the people, so that they may live in dignity and become the engine of our development, and, better still, so that the general welfare of the people can become the firm basis of our democracy.My Government has also committed to a policy of zero tolerance for corruption and an end to impunity. We expect to face that challenge with the firm support of the judiciary and the Office of the Attorney General.Paraguays economy has enviable numbers. We are the only country in the region that has not altered its currency, the guarani, since it was first introduced in 1943. Our macroeconomic indicators are more than In that connection, I especially want to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts and his commitment to peace, the rule of law and human rights."}}
