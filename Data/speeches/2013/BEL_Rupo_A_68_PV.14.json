{"speech":{"0":" It was in my country, in Ypres, during the First World War, that chemical weapons were used in a conflict for the first time. We can all recall the dreadful suffering of thousands of those soldiers. Almost 100 years later, that same suffering is being inflicted on thousands of Syrians. Despite the international Geneva Protocol of 1925, the history of the world — a shared history — is repeated, from Ypres to Damascus.This is the second year that I have addressed the General Assembly from this rostrum. In one year, so many hopes have been raised and fulfilled but, at the same time, so many additional war crimes have been committed. A year ago, I spoke of 30,000 Syrian deaths. Today there are 120,000. And that conflict is not the only one. While we are talking here, atrocities continue in various parts of the world.All of us here must show as much courage as the men and women who are fighting in the streets for their freedom and dignity. Within the United Nations, we have everything we need to act, while those who are fighting often have nothing but their courage to live on. If a veto must be cast, it should be a veto on tyrants and their crimes.No one can end a famine or stop a tyrant alone.Peace is a shared responsibility. That is why there is no alternative to multilateralism and politics, if we seek to improve the lot of humankind. That is what motivates Belgiums commitment, which is political, financial and at times even military, as the fifteenth most significant contributor to the United Nations.My country is also of the view that among our responsibilities we have the responsibility to protect — that is to say, the responsibility to prevent and fight the particularly atrocious crimes of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. Belgium fully supports the actions of the United Nations in that regard. In 2014, we will organize an international conference in Brussels on the prevention of genocide.When we work together, we achieve results. Mali is proof of that. But let us not forget that nothing is ever United Nations asdfGeneral AssemblySixty-eighth session14th plenary meetingThursday, 26 September 2013, 6 p.m. New YorkOfficial RecordsPresident: Mr. Ashe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Laws must be respected, including in situations of conflict. I am referring in particular to humanitarian law, so that victims can receive assistance and care.Belgium has echoed and tirelessly backed the calls from humanitarian agencies for the obstacles to their activities to be lifted. We demand that access to health care be improved on the ground everywhere, including in Syria. All parties must respect international humanitarian law. My country participates actively in efforts to provide assistance to populations that have been victims of fighting. The onset of winter and the sharp rise in the number of victims, refugees and displaced persons mean that the international community must step up its efforts further still.The law must also stop impunity. Peace cannot ever be built on amnesty for the worst crimes, or turning a blind eye thereto. Together with 56 other States, Belgium has called for the situation in Syria to be referred to the International Criminal Court. The work of the Court is contributing to bringing about an era of responsibility. All States should cooperate with the Court.The law must also make it possible to bring dictatorships and oppression to an end. In 2010, all those who defend democracy welcomed the advent of the Arab Spring. I am not one of those who today have turned their backs on that hope. Let us not forgot all of the women and men in Tunisia, Libya, Egypt and elsewhere who wish to live in peace. We must support them and promote the holding of free elections. We should encourage them to draft constitutions that guarantee fundamental rights, justice and equality. We should also recall that winning an election or exercising authority following elections does not give someone the right to oppress minorities. True democracy means respecting and protecting minorities.The law must guarantee individual freedoms. Freedom means, for example, the right of young women to study and to choose their partners for themselves or to remain single. Freedom also means the rights of women to move in public as they please. Freedom also means to right to practice ones religion or to practice none at all. Freedom also means the right of heterosexual and homosexual couples to walk hand in hand in the street or in other public spaces. I am proud that Belgium guarantees those fundamental freedoms. I am also proud that my country promotes efforts to spread such freedoms everywhere in the world.settled forever. For it to last, peace must be continuously nourished. I would like to commend in particular the recent efforts of the international community in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The population of the north-east of the country has for years suffered massacres, mass rapes, the forced recruitment of soldiers, including of child soldiers, pillage and forced displacement. Just yesterday, witnesses told me of martyred children. That is shameful.The efforts of the Secretary-General and the Security Council to strengthen the mandate of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are bearing fruit. The Intervention Brigade is playing an active role in protecting the population. The Addis Ababa Framework offers a genuine possibility for the stabilization of the entire region. However, let us make no mistake: agreement at Kampala is essential for the process to be successful. Pragmatic solutions must also be found — without, however, accepting general amnesty or allowing for impunity for war crimes and crimes against humanity.Belgium stands ready to contribute to such solutions. The territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo must also be respected. All external interference must cease. Belgium urges the Congolese authorities to implement the structural reforms needed in the army and the police, so as to re-establish the rule of law throughout the national territory and to guarantee the prosperity of the Congolese people.Going to war, building walls and curtailing rights is always easier than building bridges and keeping the peace. It is easier to build walls than to organize a democratic system or build hospitals and schools. In our contemporary globalized world, conflicts can be resolved only by political solutions. That is why Belgium supports the efforts of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States, as he seeks to bring the parties to the negotiating table. In that regard, I welcome the American-Russian initiative to hold the “Geneva II” conference.It is not death that metes out justice; it is respect for the law. It is the law that organizes human societies, protects the weak and prevents violence. Law is essential because a world without rules — whether in terms of civil interactions, trade or finance — leaves humankind face to face with its worst enemy: itself. two areas that are basic for all peoples? I support the call by the President of Brazil for protecting the private lives of citizens everywhere, in particular on the Internet. She proposed the establishment of a multilateral framework designed to effectively ensure the protection of data online. The Internet must not become an invisible battleground. It should remain an instrument of freedom and development for all, a place where all can communicate in peace and security.In 2014, along with other nations, Belgium will solemnly commemorate the centenary of the First World War. We will do it out of duty to the memory of the young men from more than 50 countries who came to die on the battlefields of my country in order to liberate us. They were not even 20 years old. We will also commemorate the wars centenary in order to teach young people of today, so that they too can become militants for peace."}}
