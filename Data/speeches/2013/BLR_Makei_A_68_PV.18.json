{"speech":{"0":" I will begin with a simple question: what is the key challenge facing todays world? I believe that it is the fact that humankinds societal evolution has not kept pace with globalization. We are constantly lagging behind. Our failure to adjust quickly and effectively has given rise to a range of political, economic and social problems. That mismatch between technological and societal development has been the norm since the beginning of the industrial revolution, in the late eighteenth century. Furthermore, these days it represents a far more serious threat than ever before. The pace of globalization has been steadily accelerating, and therefore we have had to adapt much more quickly.We need a mechanism that will enable us swiftly and effectively to address this problem. Such a mechanism could appropriately be called “a new global world order”.Today we can hardly say that we have a global order at all, as the notion of order implies stability, which we do not have at present. The old rules are not being observed, and new ones have not been established. We permanently find ourselves stricken by various global crises. The great Powers seek to provide global governance by means of clubs whose membership is limited to themselves. Other countries wager on regionalism, and medium-sized and small countries see their rights infringed at every turn. Overall, the current geopolitical situation is characterized by an increasing dynamic of multilevel competition as well as by the global governance crisis. What is even more alarming is that all of this is taking place against a backdrop of increasing global inequality. seek neither diktat nor dominance over others. What is more, having just recently emerged from the grip of poverty and domestic instability, many countries have fully realized the importance of global development and of solidarity aimed at the least developed countries.Building on that understanding, Belarus is keen to rekindle the topic of middle-income countries at the international level. In May, we held a regional conference on middle-income countries in the context of sustainable development. We witnessed immense interest in that event. Likewise, Belarus welcomes the high-level international conference on middle-income countries held in June in Costa Rica. Those and other relevant events point to the need for more focused work within the United Nations system on cooperation with middle-income countries. At the same time, a number of ongoing trends are working to prevent the strengthening of the middle class in those States. The unfettered globalization ardently carried out by the so-called market fundamentalists has served to increase inequality in the world and hollow out the middle class. Many, in both developed and developing countries, are already confronting the resulting political and economic consequences.We pin our hopes for improvement on the ongoing effort at the United Nations to design a post-2015 United Nations development agenda. The world is fast approaching the 2015 completion deadline set for the Millennium Development Goals. My countrys current view is that the key lesson to be drawn, even at this stage, is that there can be no lasting progress in todays world in any individual area if other areas are neglected. That is because everyone and every thing in the world — people, economies and threats — has become highly interconnected. For instance, one cannot succeed in tackling migration without addressing poverty, conflicts and environmental disasters. That perception, in turn, points to the need to set the stage for a comprehensive post-2015 development agenda. It is highly commendable that the United Nations, its Member States and many other stakeholders have already been actively engaged in the preparatory process. Likewise, it is gratifying that everyone views the paradigm of sustainable development as the basis for the future agenda. That is the proper course, as sustainable development — based on its economic, social and environmental components — is the best approach to meeting the global development challenges in a truly comprehensive manner.Let us then build relations based on the notion of content rather than form. Indeed, why does the domestic political situation of, say, Belarus or Cuba serve as a basis for some countries to pursue policies of sanctions and persecution — policies that contravene international law — against those States? After all, it was the people of those countries who determined their form and they do not wish another, because their Governments pursue accountable policies. By and large, the people have no objections to them in terms of content.The call for a strong State, of course, has nothing in common with a call for dictatorship. Franklin Roosevelt said: “History proves that dictatorships do not grow out of strong and successful Governments, but out of weak and helpless ones”.State weakness is no longer a humanitarian concern but a problem of international security. It is a guarantee that we will fail to cope with the mismatch generated at the global level by the different paces of the globalization and societal adaptation processes.We deem the next area of focus to be efforts to ensure global convergence. It is worth pointing out that such attempts have often been undertaken in the past. Unfortunately, the areas of application were inappropriate from the start. Convergence basically occurred in the context of attempts by the mighty of the world to impose their own political and economic models on other countries. That was outright coercion. As a result, all such attempts have backfired.Ms. Picco (Monaco), Vice-President, took the Chair.In todays world, completely different approaches are needed — approaches aimed at unity and stability rather than disunity and anarchy. We need social convergence. To put it simply, we must work to create a robust middle class in every State, without coercion. After all, all countries have an interest in a sizeable national middle class. History has clearly shown that success in that area will ensure the domestic stability of a State and foster its interest in pursuing a foreign policy of international stability. We are convinced that the benefits produced by the middle class at the national level can have a similar impact at the international level. A large number of middle-income countries worldwide would be the best safeguard to ensure a truly multipolar, fair and stable world. Such a group of States would Nations and multilateralism of his country, Antigua and Barbuda, the Caribbean Community and the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States. I would also like to convey my countrys acknowledgement of the dynamism and dedication with which the President of the General Assembly at its previous session, Mr. Vuk Jeremic, performed his duties. I wish also to express special appreciation for the Secretary-Generals untiring work in defence of peace during an extremely challenging period for the international community. As always, the Secretary-General can continue to count on Portugals support. I take this opportunity to strongly condemn the terrorist attack that occurred in Nairobi and to deliver a message of solidarity to the authorities and the people of Kenya. Acts such as those remind us that efforts to combat terrorism continue to be of paramount importance. We will not live in a world of peace and liberty or in an environment of tolerance and mutual respect until we eradicate terrorism.The Organization was created to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, basing its action on faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person. The United Nations has undertaken much in its 68 years to achieve those goals globally. Unfortunately, in many regions those goals remain an illusion. Such is the case in Syria, where the horrors of war and the unspeakable suffering of the population now prevail. The devastating images that reach us daily show a country that is being physically destroyed. The numbers speak for themselves: more than 100,000 dead, almost 7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, 4 million internally displaced persons and 2 million refugees. A tragedy on that scale is the result of serious and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, aggravated by the recent and unacceptable use of chemical weapons, something we believed had been universally banished forever.The world was shocked at the use of chemical weapons in Ghouta on 21 August. I want to be very clear about this: the use of chemical weapons represents a violation of international law, a heinous crime and a regression from civilization. We cannot stand idle in the face of such a violation of the barrier between civilization and barbarism, a barrier that the international community has vowed never to cross again. We, the members of the Assembly, once again face a serious international crisis where we are in a Belarus shares the view that the sustainable development goals should be at the heart of the next agenda. We see the need to develop such goals in as many areas as possible. It is particularly crucial that they address those areas not covered by the Millennium Development Goals, such as, for example, migration, energy and employment. We believe that each and every goal must be achieved through appropriate thematic global partnerships among States, international organizations, civil society and the private sector. A good example of that is the global partnership against slavery and trafficking in persons initiative, which is now being successfully implemented. We hope that a comprehensive approach to development will help in controlling globalization and, more important, ensure that it is fair. After all, it must work in the interests of all rather than of a few. Drawing on a historical analogy, one can argue that the post-2015 development agenda represents our future, comprehensive “new deal” — like the one launched by Franklin D. Roosevelt. The United Nations serves as the indispensable platform — thanks to its unquestionable legitimacy, universal membership and comprehensive scope — for the international community to appropriately reconcile and subsequently implement its interests in terms of the new deal.The greatest danger in geostrategic uncertainty is not the uncertainty itself; rather, it is the desire to take action in a complex setting using yesterdays logic, namely, a business-as-usual attitude. We are certain that only by shaking off such an approach will we be able to forge a global order to benefit all people on Earth."}}
