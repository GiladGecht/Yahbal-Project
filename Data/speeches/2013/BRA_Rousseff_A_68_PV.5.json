{"speech":{"0":" I would first like to briefly express my pleasure at seeing the representative of Antigua and Barbuda, a country that is part of the Caribbean and is very dear to Brazil and our region, at the helm of the proceedings of this session of the General Assembly. You can count on the permanent support of my Government, Sir.Before I begin my statement, I would also like to voice the Brazilian Governments and peoples repudiation of the recent terrorist attack in Nairobi, and to convey our condolences to and express our solidarity with the families of the victims and the people and the Government of Kenya. Wherever terrorism may occur and wherever it originates, we will always condemn it unequivocally and resolve firmly to deal with it. We will never compromise with barbarity.I would like to draw the Assemblys attention to an exceedingly important and serious matter. Recent revelations concerning the activities of a global network The choice of the post-2015 development agenda as the theme for this session of the General Assembly could not be more appropriate. The fight against poverty, hunger and inequality constitutes the greatest challenge of our time. For that reason, Brazil has adopted a socially inclusive economic model based on generating employment, strengthening small-scale family agriculture, expanding credit, increasing the worth of salaries and developing a vast social protection network, particularly through our family stipend programme. In addition to those achievements, we have lifted 22 million Brazilians out of extreme poverty in only two years through out plan to free Brazil of extreme poverty. We have drastically reduced child mortality. A recent UNICEF report indicates that Brazil has achieved one of the most significant reductions in the child mortality in the world.Children are a top priority for Brazil. That is reflected in our commitment to education. We are the country that has most increased public investment in education, according to the latest Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development report. We have also just approved legislation that earmarks 75 per cent of all petroleum revenue to education and 25 per cent to health services.In the debate on the post-2015 development agenda we must focus on the results of the Rio de Janeiro United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development as key drivers. The major step taken in Rio de Janeiro was to place poverty at the very centre of the sustainable development agenda. Poverty is not a problem exclusive to developing countries, and environmental protection is not a goal to achieve only after poverty is overcome. The meaning of the post-2015 agenda is the development of a world in which it is possible to grow, to include, to conserve and to protect. By promoting social mobility and overcoming extreme poverty, as we are doing, we have created an immense contingent of citizens with improved quality of life, increased access to information and greater awareness of their rights â€” citizens with new hopes, new desires and new demands.The demonstrations last June in Brazil were an inseparable part of our process of building democracy and of social change. My Administration did not repress them; on the contrary, it listened to and understood the voices from the streets. We listened and understood because we ourselves came from the streets. We ourselves came of age and developed through the great cannot possibly allow recurring illegal actions to take place as if they constituted a normal, ordinary practice. They are unacceptable. Brazil will redouble its efforts to adopt legislation, technologies and mechanisms to protect us adequately from the illegal interception of communications and data. My Administration will do everything within its reach and powers to defend the human rights of all Brazilians and all the worlds citizens, as well as to protect the fruits of the ingenuity of Brazilian workers and companies.The problem, however, goes beyond the bilateral relationship of two countries. It affects the international community itself and demands a response from it. Information and telecommunication technologies cannot become the new battlefield among States. The time is ripe to create the conditions to prevent cyberspace from being used as a weapon of war through espionage, sabotage and attacks against the systems and infrastructure of other countries. The United Nations must play a leading role in the effort to properly regulate the conduct of States with regard to those technologies. It should also consider the importance of the Internet and social networks as part of our efforts to build democracy worldwide.For that reason, Brazil will present proposals for the establishment of a multilateral civil framework for the governance and use of the Internet, as well as measures to guarantee the effective protection of the data and information that traverse it. We must establish multilateral mechanisms for the worldwide web that are capable of ensuring key principles. The first is freedom of expression, individual privacy and respect for human rights; secondly, multilateral, open democratic governance, conducted with transparency while stimulating collective creativity and the broad participation of civil society, Governments and the private sector; thirdly, the principle of universality, which ensures social and human development along with the construction of inclusive and non-discriminatory societies; fourthly, cultural diversity, without the imposition of beliefs, customs or values; and fifthly, the neutrality of the web, which must be governed only by technical and ethical criteria, rendering unacceptable any restriction of it for political, commercial, religious or any other purposes. Harnessing the full potential of the Internet therefore requires responsible regulation that will simultaneously guarantee the freedom of expression, security and respect for human rights. towards sound macroeconomic policies; secondly, continuing and upholding successful social inclusion policies; and thirdly, the adoption of measures aimed at increasing our productivity, and therefore our international competitiveness. We are committed to stability and inflation-control, to improving the quality of public spending and to upholding proper fiscal performance. We reiterate our support for a reform of the International Monetary Fund. The governance of the Fund should reflect the weight of emerging and developing countries in the world economy. Delaying such adaptive reform will further reduce the Funds legitimacy and effectiveness.The year 2015 will mark the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations and the tenth anniversary of the 2005 World Summit. As such, it will be an occasion for us to carry out the urgent reform that we have been calling for since that first summit. We must avoid a collective defeat of coming to 2015 without a Security Council capable of fully exercising its responsibilities in todays world. The limited representation in the Security Council, in view of the new challenges of the twenty-first century, is a source of grave concern. Examples of that concern include the huge difficulty in providing a solution for the ongoing Syrian conflict and the state of paralysis in addressing the Israeli-Palestinian question. The recurrent polarization among permanent members on important issues has led to a dangerous inaction. The Council must be urgently endowed with voices that are both independent and constructive. Only by expanding the number of permanent and non-permanent members of the Security Council and by including developing countries in both categories will it be possible to solve and overcome the current representativeness and legitimacy deficits from which the Council suffers.The general debate provides us with an opportunity to reiterate the fundamental principles that guide my countrys foreign policy and inform our stance on pressing issues on todays international agenda. We guide ourselves and our actions through a defence of a multilateral world governed by international law, where the peaceful solution of conflicts holds sway and where the pursuit of a fair and solidarity-based order prevails both economically and socially.The crisis in Syria has caused unrest and breeds a sense of anger. Two and a half years of lives lost and destruction have caused the greatest humanitarian disaster of the century.struggles of Brazil. The street is our ground, our base. The protesters did not ask for a return to the past. Rather, they asked for further progress towards a future of greater rights, more participation and more social gains.In Brazil, it was during this decade that we experienced the greatest reduction in social inequality in the past 50 years. It was during this decade that we created a system of social protection that has allowed us to nearly eradicate extreme poverty. We know all too well that democracy generates the desire for more democracy, that social inclusion creates demands for further social inclusion, and that quality of life awakens peoples yearning for even more quality of life. For us, all the progress achieved thus far is just a beginning. Our development strategy demands more, as desired by all Brazilians.It is not enough to listen. We must act. We must transform this extraordinary energy into achievements for everyone. I have therefore launched five major pacts: a pact against corruption and for political reform; a pact for urban mobility, geared towards the improvement of public transportation and urban reform; a pact for education, our great passport to the future, which will be supported by royalties from oil revenues and the petroleum social fund; a health pact that provides for doctors to assist Brazilians in the poorest and most remote regions of the country; and a fiscal responsibility pact, to guarantee the economic viability of this new stage in our history.Although the most acute phase of the crisis is behind us, the situation of the world economy remains fragile, with unacceptable levels of unemployment. According to statistics from the International Labor Organization, there are more than 200 million unemployed people throughout the world. That phenomenon affects populations of both developed and developing countries. This is the right time for us to strengthen the trends for growth in the worlds economy, which is showing signs of recovery. Emerging countries alone cannot ensure the resumption of global growth. More than ever before, it is necessary to engage in concerted action in order to reduce unemployment and re-establish momentum in international trade. We are all in the same boat.My country is restoring growth despite the impact of the international crisis of the past few years. We have relied on three key elements: first, a commitment would be able to overcome the wounds of the Second World War and the hope that, yes, it would be possible to build, from the rubble of destruction and massacre, a new world of liberty, solidarity and prosperity. We all have the responsibility not to let such a generous and fruitful hope die. "}}
