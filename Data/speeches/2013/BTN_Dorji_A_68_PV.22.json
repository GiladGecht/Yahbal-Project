{"speech":{"0":" I bring to you, Mr. President, and through you to all representatives the warm greetings and good wishes of His Majesty Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. Allow me also to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I assure you of my delegations full support and cooperation as you steer the important work of this session.I am deeply honoured to have the opportunity to address the Assembly for the first time. I do so owing to the mandate accorded by the people of Bhutan to the Peoples Democratic Party at the second parliamentary elections held this summer.The second parliamentary elections were yet another milestone on the path of democracy that Bhutan chose to undertake five years ago. In 2008 there were two political parties, whereas four parties contested this years elections. The people of Bhutan voted for change and ushered in a new Government. These, I believe, are signs of a vibrant democracy enabling the people of Bhutan to exercise their will through the ballot box.We know that democracy needs to go beyond elections. We will therefore continually work to strengthen democratic institutions, the rule of law, an independent judiciary, a vibrant civil society, an open and free media and, above all, a democratic culture that enables people to voice their aspirations and to live with dignity, equality and prosperity. As we embark on a new phase in our relatively young democracy, we do so in full confidence that democracy in Bhutan is irreversible and on a firm footing. In this journey, we 20 March as the International Day of Happiness, at its sixty-sixth session.Happiness as a development policy must relate to individuals as well as to Governments. It is the sacred responsibility of Governments to ensure that conditions are created for its citizens to pursue their individual happiness within the larger aspirations of the country. All our achievements, including the peaceful transition to a democracy in 2008, as well as the progress realized in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, have been as a result of embarking on a people-centred development approach.Encouraged by our positive national experience, Bhutan has facilitated efforts to elaborate a holistic approach to development. We intend to share the findings with Member States and the wider international community at an appropriate time. We hope that this modest contribution will serve as a useful input to the ongoing discussions on the post-2015 development agenda.While Bhutan has made significant socioeconomic progress, we face many challenges and vulnerabilities, being both a landlocked and a least developed country. Our economy remains import-driven and dependent on a single export commodity. Poverty, youth unemployment, natural disasters and vulnerability to adverse impacts of climate change, including glacial lake outburst f loods, pose challenges. We will therefore continue to count on external support and assistance as we work towards achieving our long-cherished goal of self-reliance and graduation from the least developed country category.We recognize that a vibrant democracy should be built on a strong economy, which is essential to bring about improvement in the lives of the people. Therefore, in the eleventh Five-Year Development Plan, the main thrust will be to promote prosperity for all through inclusive social development, accelerated green economic development and infrastructure development.The United Nations, with its global scope and mandate, remains the only universal organization that can forge a global coordinated response to the pressing challenges in areas ranging from peace and security to development. The challenges of our times are, however, testing the United Nations and the resolve of its Member States to work together. Every effort must be made to strengthen the role and efficacy of a United Nations that is just, democratic and representative and allows space built. These principles must guide our efforts to come up with a holistic and transformative development agenda that puts people at the centre of development and brings about shared prosperity and happiness to all. Within this broader vision, poverty eradication must form a central theme of the post-2015 agenda. For Bhutan, the alleviation of poverty remains a challenge and features as a key priority in the current eleventh five-year development plan.Equally important is the need to bring about inclusive development, which is one of the priority objectives of the Royal Government of Bhutan. Targeted interventions are being planned to promote the livelihoods of the poorest and most vulnerable communities in Bhutan.The empowerment of women should constitute one of the main building blocks of the post-2015 development agenda. Any development agenda will fall short if it does not include the empowerment of women as a key component.Issues related to youth and to providing gainful employment to a growing population is one of the critical challenges that my country continues to face. It is therefore vitally important that the post-2015 development agenda address the issues of youth, as they are the key stakeholders of that era.I cannot overemphasize the importance of a strong means of implementation in the post-2015 development agenda. Without it, the capacity of developing and least developed countries to realize the post-2015 development priorities will remain severely challenged. At the intergovernmental level, Bhutan will continue its close engagement in the work of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals, on which it is pleased to serve as a member. We look forward to contributing to the intergovernmental negotiations towards the elaboration of a single post-2015 development agenda.The subject of development inevitably leads me to refer to my countrys experience, in which it is guided by the development philosophy of Gross National Happiness, a vision that has given character to my country. Happiness and development have come to mean many things, and there are indeed many experts and a rich body of literature on the subject. This body also adopted resolution , on happiness, at its sixty-fifth session, and resolution proclaiming Development Goals are an important first step towards addressing some of the worst socioeconomic conditions facing approximately 40 per cent of humankind, targeted as they are at reducing the worst manifestations of underdevelopment.In our view, the success of the Millennium Development Goals depends on two sets of simultaneous actions: first, a reorientation of national responsibilities; and, second, of equal importance, the reorientation of the international community. Such reorientation will enable us to chart a more meaningful path towards meeting the targets of the Millennium Development Goals and moving towards the post-2015 Development agenda.That is particularly relevant if we take heed of the 2013 report on the Millennium Development Goals, which reveals some rather interesting facts, such as: most developing countries are performing well in meeting the targets; and developed countries, which have committed themselves to Goal 8 by making their aid pledges viable and effective, are nevertheless well behind in their general performance in meeting the targets.Official development assistance is in constant decline, and the agreements concluded in 2001 within the context of the World Trade Organization to improve access to international markets have been stalled during the Doha Round. That stalling has proved to be so harmful that dealing with market access on behalf of the poorest nations has been left out of subsequent agendas. Furthermore, as we all know, the ongoing financial and economic crisis is having a detrimental impact on developing nations because official development assistance is drastically declining.Clearly, a number of large developing countries, mainly in Asia, as well as some countries endowed with natural resources in Africa and South America, have made substantial economic progress. Their statistics, however, should not blind us to the fact that inequality is rampant and that almost 1.2 billion people are still living in extreme poverty and do not have access to affordable and adequate health services, while millions of children are still denied their right to primary education.We have learned the important lesson that developing countries are obliged to undertake adequate measures to strengthen economic interactions among themselves in addition to ties with their traditional trading partners for its Members, including the smallest, to participate fully in its work. That is the key to the legitimacy of an effective multilateral system.We remain hopeful that under your able leadership, Sir, the sixty-eighth session will further advance work on the reform of the United Nations. The General Assembly must be revitalized and its role strengthened. The membership of the Security Council in both the permanent and the non-permanent categories must be expanded to bring it into line with contemporary realities and to make the Council a more representative body.These are challenging times indeed. It falls upon us to seek the wisdom of those who created this great institution to work together in the spirit of international cooperation in solving international problems. We have the opportunity not only to strengthen the role of the United Nations and advance multilateralism, but also to define a holistic development agenda that will respond to the universal aspiration for happiness."}}
