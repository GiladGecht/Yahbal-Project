{"speech":{"0":" Allow me, on behalf of the Botswana delegation, to join previous speakers in congratulating President Ashe most sincerely on his assumption of the presidency of the Assembly. His election demonstrates the confidence and high esteem in which he personally and his great country, Antigua unremitting efforts to save the planet from climate change and its negative effects.Botswana welcomes the adoption earlier this year of the long-overdue Arms Trade Treaty. The Treaty establishes common international standards for the regulation of international trade in conventional arms, ammunition and parts and components, with a view to strengthening international peace and security. In that regard, I am delighted to report that arrangements are under way to facilitate our signing and ratification of that vital instrument in the very near future.Botswana remains firmly committed to a strong and effective international criminal justice system â€” hence our continued strong support for the mandate and work of the International Criminal Court. We believe that the Court has a vital role to play in the fight against impunity, genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression.In that regard, last April, Botswana hosted a regional workshop for African States parties to the Rome Statute. The workshop was aimed at encouraging African States parties to ratify the 2010 Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute, which deal with the specific question of the crime of aggression. I am pleased to say that, following the workshop, Botswana became the first African State party to ratify the Kampala amendments. We can only hope that other State parties will follow suit so that we can secure the requisite number of ratifications for the amendments to enter into force.Turning now to issues of international peace and security, it defies logic that, throughout the course of history, humankind has unleashed untold suffering on humankind. Conflict is raging in many parts of the world, where innocent lives are being lost needlessly. My delegation wishes to reiterate that States have a duty and a responsibility to protect their populations from war crimes and crimes against humanity and to see to it that the perpetrators of such crimes do not benefit from impunity. In situations where it is clear that States have failed or are unwilling to exercise their responsibility to protect, it is only fair and proper that the international community should intervene. In that regard, I refer mainly to the responsibility of the Security Council.For slightly over two years now, the people of Syria have been engulfed in a brutal civil war whose end seems nowhere in sight. We remain deeply concerned that Syria continues to be soaked in the blood of its HIAIDS treatment, care and support services. We have drastically reduced the mother-to-child transmission of HIAIDS. We are working tirelessly towards achieving zero new infections and zero HIAIDS-related deaths by 2015.We reaffirm our commitment to the fight against HIAIDS. Central to our efforts is the commitment to ensuring respect for human rights and expanding access to prevention, treatment and care support services for affected populations, including those most at risk. In addition, we remain committed to providing a good quality of life for all of Botswana. In that regard, we give the utmost priority to the implementation of poverty eradication programmes, with particular focus on vulnerable communities and vulnerable groups, such as women, youth, the elderly and persons with disabilities.Despite all of the achievements we have made to date, serious challenges remain. Permit me to briefly address the vexing subject of climate change and the situation of countries in special categories, including middle-income countries. Botswana is among the sub-Saharan African countries that suffer the most from the adverse impact of climate change. Some of the notable manifestations of climate change are extreme temperatures, water shortages, land degradation, desertification and persistent drought. Climate change also has adverse impacts on health and food security.While it is gratifying that progress continues to be made in many countries in the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, my delegation believes that more needs to be done, particularly to assist vulnerable countries in arid and semi-arid areas and landlocked and transit countries, such as my own, that are also susceptible to drought and desertification. Financial support, technology transfer and capacity-building need to be generously extended to that special category of countries in order to assist them in adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change.Last year, Botswana hosted the Summit for Sustainability in Africa, whose outcome declaration calls upon Governments to ensure that the contributions of natural capital to sustainable economic growth and the maintenance and improvement of social capital and human well-being are quantified and integrated into development and business practices. We wish to commend the work done by non-governmental environmental organizations worldwide in their sympathy to the affected countries and the families of the deceased. Those acts of terror are a threat to international peace and security and militate against the international communitys efforts to build a secure, peaceful and prosperous world.Such terrorist acts are transnational in nature and call therefore for a global response. To that end, we appeal to the conscience and resolve of all members of the international community to remain united and steadfast, if we are to win that fight. There can be no doubt that, if left unchecked, international terrorism has the potential to undermine our global development agenda.We find it opportune to commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the vanguard role he continues to play in the maintenance of international peace and security, as well as in addressing issues of human suffering across the globe. The Secretary-General should also be applauded for his continued efforts to coordinate international efforts to advance the post-2015 development agenda.Let me conclude by reaffirming Botswanas continued commitment to playing its part in the quest for international peace and security as well as in the international communitys unrelenting efforts towards making the world a safer, peaceful and more prosperous place for both present and future generations."}}
