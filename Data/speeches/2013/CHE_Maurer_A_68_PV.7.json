{"speech":{"0":" The world in which we live is profoundly changing, but whether it changes for the better is another matter. That is up to us. We often get the impression that great strides are being taken towards a better, more peaceful future. Unfortunately, reality imposes disappointing setbacks upon us. I recall an important step taken 150 years ago. In 1863, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was founded in Geneva, giving rise to a global movement. Thanks to their humanitarian spirit, representatives of that organization work to provide humanitarian help worldwide for people affected by armed conflict and other violent situations. The humanitarian work of the ICRC is based on the principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence. All victims of conflicts receive the same treatment, and help is granted to all vulnerable persons. All human beings are valued equally. Alongside the humanitarian tradition shared by Switzerland and the ICRC, my country is proud of another tradition dating back centuries — neutrality. I would recall that for centuries Switzerlands foreign policy has been anchored in peaceful coexistence among States. Thanks to our neutrality, we maintain relations with all countries. We never take sides, but we can provide support or propose our mediation. Furthermore, our neutrality allows us to offer our good offices. Humanitarian engagement is part of our history. It is an honour for us to make our neutral soil available for peace talks, and we will continue to do all we can to contribute towards peace in the world, in particular through our good offices. That impartial work is based on our belief that there are differences between people and between nations. Those differences are natural. Moreover, all human beings enjoy equal rights. The protection of human rights is a key element of the Swiss commitment. Those rights are an expression of the obligations set out under international law and must be protected. Switzerland is concerned by the widespread excesses of violence and numerous human rights violations. It calls on all States and civilian actors to renounce violence. In the Middle East, violent conflicts are imposing unacceptable suffering on the civil population. The situation in Syria has deteriorated to such an extent that United Nations asdfGeneral AssemblySixty-eighth session7th plenary meetingTuesday, 24 September 2013, 6 p.m. New YorkOfficial RecordsPresident: Mr. Ashe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The United Nations was created to find such solutions, and to that end it must be efficient, innovative and effective. Only thus will it be able to make progress in ensuring the equal rights of people and nations. Switzerland is firmly committed to contributing to that task. At present, certain developments are at odds with the shared values laid down in the Charter. I would like to address those subjects and launch a discussion on these worrisome developments.As the representative of a neutral State with a long-standing humanitarian tradition, it is with some concern that I observe the growing resurgence of power politics. I note that large States are once again choosing to exercise their power and force and that they view smaller States less and less as equal partners. I sincerely hope that this trend will be reversed as soon as possible. Otherwise, the fundamental values of the Charter, which unite the international community and to which its members feel committed, will be placed in doubt. As I have already said, the tendency towards power politics on the international stage worries me, for we believe that the countries on this planet should be free to choose their own futures, even as they respect others States and accept the rules of peaceful coexistence among peoples, without sacrificing their specific character. We believe in peaceful competition among economies. We believe in the diversity of the world — the peaceful diversity of sovereign States that treat one another fairly and as equal partners. People are free to draw up their own constitutions and to determine their own economic order and their own system of law. No State may impose its law over that of another country. Problems are not solved by diktat, but through negotiations. The shared norms and rules of international law exist to ensure that it is not simply the law of the strongest that applies. The principles of sovereignty and equal rights provide peace and stability and foster friendly relations between all peoples.Those are the convictions upon which the Charter of the United Nations is based. Do we still share these convictions today? The way in which large nations have acted in dealings with small nations recently has disturbed me because I often have the impression that force has often been placed above the law. The United Nations is active humanitarian organizations are unable to cope. Serious and systematic violations and abuses of international humanitarian law and human rights cannot be tolerated in any circumstances. Such crimes must not go unpunished, regardless of which side is responsible. That is why my country, together with 57 like-minded States, called on the Security Council in January to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. The use of chemical weapons is a particularly despicable crime. It is imperative to shed light on all facts. With that in mind, Switzerland welcomes recent developments. I stress the need for the international community to spare no effort to pave the way for another conference at the earliest possible date in Geneva. That conference should result in a negotiated and lasting solution that would take into account the legitimate aspirations of all Syrians.Switzerland is not the only country bound by the principle of equal rights. The Charter of the United Nations endows it with universal validity. The preamble reaffirms “faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women”. What applies to all human beings also applies to the States we live in. That is why, in the same sentence, after referring to the fundamental rights of all people, the Charter refers explicitly to the equal rights of nations “large and small”. Under paragraph 2 of Article I of the Charter, the United Nations seeks “to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples”. Paragraph 1 of Article 2 states that “[t]he Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members.”I firmly believe that those principles are the keystone for the peaceful coexistence of all people and populations of this world.But are we still sufficiently aware of this? Or are we prone to lose ourselves in grandiose ideas and minor details? I have the impression that in international politics too much is said of how things should be in an ideal world and too little about reality. I cannot help but feel that excessive bureaucracy creates a kind of parallel universe that leads to increased isolation. At the end of the day, that leads to increasingly higher costs and fewer concrete results. education and governmental affairs. I would say that social democracy was invented in Uruguay. For nearly 50 years, the world saw us as a kind of Switzerland, but in reality in economic matters we were the bastard children of the British Empire. When the empire ended, we experienced the bitter and terrible terms of trade and we yearned for the past for almost 50 years, remembering Maracana. Today, we have re-emerged in a globalized world, having learned from our pain. My personal story is that of a boy — because I once was a boy — who like others wanted to change his times and his world and dreamed of a free and classless society. My mistakes were in part the results of my era. Obviously I take responsibility for them, but sometimes I cry: “If only I had the strength that I had when we enjoyed such utopia!”However, I do not look towards the past because what we have today was created from the fertile ashes of yesterday. On the contrary, I am not on this planet to settle scores or to reminisce. I am greatly anguished by the future that I will not see, and to which I have committed myself. Yes, it is possible to have a world with more humanity, but perhaps today the main task is to save life.I am from the South and I have come from the South to this Assembly. I share with the thousands of poor compatriots in cities, in the jungles, in the plains, in the pampas and the canyons of Latin America the common fatherland that we are creating. I bear upon my shoulders the indigenous cultures, the remains of colonialism in the Malvinas, and the futile and regrettable blockades of Cuba under the Caribbean sun. I also bear the consequences of the electronic surveillance, which does nothing but create the distrust that poisons us needlessly. I also come with a huge social debt and with the need to defend the Amazon, the seas, and our great rivers of America. I also have the duty to fight for all on behalf of my fatherland and so that Colombia can finally regain peace. I have the duty to fight for tolerance for those who are different and with whom we have differences and disagreements. We do not need tolerance for those with whom we agree. Tolerance is the foundation of peaceful coexistence, understanding that we are all different in this world. I fight against the illicit economy, drug trafficking, theft, fraud, corruption — the contemporary scourges unleashed by an opposite set of values and by those in a vast range of areas. There is perhaps a risk that it has taken on too much and lost sight of what is essential and concrete. The United Nations and its Member States often seem at a loss when the principles upon which the Organization were founded are at stake. Let us never forget what underlies these principles: the equal rights of people and the equal rights and sovereignty of nations. They are embodiments of the lessons of history, which has been a painful story of oppression, foreign domination and conflicts.Together we must decide which path we want to take. Do we want to continue squandering our strength on issues of secondary interest? I believe that we should strive, here and now, to reaffirm and live out the values of the United Nations. Let us commit ourselves to achieving a peaceful world in which people and nations enjoy equal rights and are of equal value — a world in which right prevails over might. It is up to all of us here in this Hall to do all in our power to achieve that goal. Let us start without delay. "}}
