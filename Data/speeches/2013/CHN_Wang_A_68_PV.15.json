{"speech":{"0":" This year has been an unusual one in Chinas development. Chinas new central collective leadership has put forward the concept of the “Chinese dream”, a dream of the great renewal of the Chinese nation, and it is leading the 1.3 billion Chinese people in an endeavour to fulfil the two centennial goals, namely, to finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects by 2020 and to turn China into a modern socialist country by the mid-twenty-first century. Having experienced profound changes in the past 5,000 years and especially the past century, China has reached a new historical starting point today.What development path will China take in the future? What domestic and foreign policies will it and bring an increasing number of tangible benefits to other countries.China will firmly promote reform of the global governance system with the United Nations at its core. The United Nations is a big stage for all countries to conduct consultation and cooperation with one another. It is also a big family where people of all countries are brought together. It is our consistent position that the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations form the cornerstone of current international relations and provide safeguards for world peace and stability. Respecting national sovereignty and opposing interference in internal affairs, safeguarding peace and opposing aggression, and promoting equality and opposing power politics; those are important principles that must be observed. China firmly upholds the role and authority of the United Nations, supports the United Nations in its renewal and self-improvement efforts, in keeping with a changing world, and looks forward to a United Nations that plays a larger role in international affairs. China is ready to deepen cooperation with the United Nations and get more actively involved in United Nations activities in various fields.China is committed to promoting democracy in international relations and the trend toward a multipolar world. We call for a greater representation and voice for developing countries in the global governance system and support the Group of 20, the BRICS group — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — and other emerging mechanisms that are playing a key role in making the international order fairer and more equitable. We also call for the reform of the international monetary and financial systems and want the role of the World Trade Organization as the main forum in the area of trade to be maintained. We are opposed to trade protectionism and are working to make economic globalization more balanced, inclusive and beneficial to all. We call on countries to enhance macroeconomic policy coordination and be mindful of the spillover effects of their respective adjustment of economic policies. We call for the strengthening of North-South dialogue and South-South cooperation to make development benefits more accessible to people of all countries.China will firmly fulfil its international responsibilities and obligations. The Chinese nation is responsible and ready to play its part. Although it remains a developing country facing the daunting task of development, China, as the second-largest economy China will remain committed to reform, to opening up and to sustainable development. It has been five years since the outbreak of the international financial crisis. The global economy is back on the right track to recovery, but the foundations of the recovery are not solid and the speed is not fast enough. The root causes of the financial crisis have yet to be removed, and the structural problems of developed countries remain unresolved. The adjustment of unconventional monetary policies from the outside, coupled with other factors, have posed new challenges and the risk of financial market volatility to emerging market countries.Where the Chinese economy is heading engages both domestic and international attention. In that regard, I wish to inform the Assembly that both the fundamentals and the overall performance of Chinas economy are sound, and Chinas development prospects are bright. The leading indicators of the Chinese economy are generally good, and China leads the major economies in growth rate.In pursuit of progress while maintaining stability, the Chinese Government has followed a macroeconomic policy that addresses both immediate and long-term needs and has adopted a series of innovative policy measures with a view to promoing steady growth, economic structural adjustment and reform. We are vigorously pursuing reform, opening up, deepening economic structural adjustment and accelerating the shift in our growth model. We are implementing the basic State policy of resource conservation and environmental protection and promoting green, circular and low-carbon development to build a sound ecological environment and a beautiful China.With its increasing economic output and its changing growth model, Chinas economy has entered a phase of high-to-medium growth rate. That is dictated by the law of economics, and it will ensure the sustained and healthy growth of the Chinese economy. The Chinese economy is being upgraded, and its future growth will deliver major dividends in four areas as a result of industrialization, information technology application, a new type of urbanization and agricultural modernization; reform and innovation; structural readjustment; and further opening up. It is projected that in the coming five years, Chinas imports of commodities will exceed $10 trillion, its overseas investment will reach $500 billion, and Chinese tourists will make over 400 million outbound visits. That will give stronger impetus to the world economy have provided and will continue to provide assistance within our means to the Syrian people, including Syrian refugees outside the country.Recently, China has been providing emergency humanitarian aid to Jordan in the amount of ¥15 million, and has provided emergency humanitarian aid in cash worth ¥24 million to the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization for displaced people within Syria and Syrian refugees in Lebanon, respectively.China has been working to promote a peaceful settlement to the Iranian nuclear issue through dialogue. We have played a constructive role in seeking a comprehensive, lasting and appropriate solution to the Iranian nuclear issue so as to uphold the international non-proliferation regime and peace and stability in the Middle East. The dialogue between Iran and the permanent members of the Security Council and Germany has created new opportunities. All the relevant parties should scale up diplomatic efforts and work for substantive progress in the dialogue at an early date.The Palestinian issue is at the core of the Middle East conflict. Guided by President Xi Jinpings four-point proposal on resolving the Palestinian issue, China will continue to work for a comprehensive, just and durable solution to the issue.Thanks to the concerted efforts of all the relevant parties, tensions on the Korean peninsula are easing. Achieving the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and maintaining long-term peace and stability on the peninsula will respond to the common interests of all parties concerned. It is Chinas consistent position that a negotiated solution through dialogue is the right way to resolve the nuclear issue on the peninsula, and the Six-Party Talks are an effective platform to promote denuclearization on the Korean peninsula. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the launch of the Six-Party Talks. We hope that all parties will create conducive conditions, build consensus, work towards the same goal and resume the talks at an early date.International development cooperation is at a crucial stage, where we must build on past achievements to make new progress. China supports the continued and full implementation of the Millennium Development Goals and the early launch of intergovernmental negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda. The post-2015 development agenda should continue to focus on development and poverty elimination, give due and a permanent member of the Security Council, is fully aware of its responsibilities and the expectations placed on it by the international community. We will be fully and more actively engaged in international affairs and work closely with other countries to meet complex global challenges and tackle the difficult issues facing humankind. We will voice Chinas views, offer Chinas wisdom, propose Chinas solutions, play Chinas due role and provide more public goods to the international community.We will vigorously advocate the right vision on justice versus special interests, and we will endeavour to build a community of common destiny with other developing countries. In our exchanges and cooperation with other developing countries, we will uphold justice and place it above special interests. We will provide assistance to other developing countries to the best of our ability, so as to enable developing countries to realize independent and sustainable development.We will play a more proactive and constructive role in addressing international and regional hotspot issues to promote peace and dialogue, defuse conflicts and safeguard world peace and stability. We will maintain our escort missions and counter-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden and increase our participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations so as to contribute more to peace and security in Africa and other relevant regions.The turmoil in Syria has lasted for nearly three years, causing great suffering and trauma to both the Syrian people and Syrias neighbours. The recent use of chemical weapons has met with universal condemnation. China firmly opposes the use of chemical weapons. We hope to see the early adoption of a Security Council resolution to support the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in launching the verification and destruction of chemical weapons, and we stand ready to make financial contributions to the OPCW for the destruction of chemical weapons in Syria and to send experts to work there on the ground.China calls for an immediate end to hostilities and violence in Syria so that the necessary conditions for the verification and destruction of chemical weapons can be created. We call for the early convening of the “Geneva II” conference and faster progress on a political resolution of the Syrian issue. China seeks no gains for itself in Syria. We respect the aspirations and choice of the Syrian people. China is following the humanitarian situation in Syria with great concern. We threats to regional and global security. The situation unfolding in Afghanistan, according to experts, is generally uncertain and unpredictable overall. In these conditions, the drawdown of the International Security Assistance Force troops in 2014 may lead to an escalation of confrontation in the country, stir up terrorism, extremism and drug trafficking, and aggravate the interregional standoff. Undoubtedly, it will have a negative impact on the situation in the wider region of Central Asia and contiguous regions.It should be recognized that the world has adopted the unambiguous view that there can be no military solution to the Afghan problem. The only way out of the Afghan crisis is a political process through negotiations among the main parties involved, the achievement of consensus regardless of how difficult it might be, and active assistance provided by the international community and the United Nations.Uzbekistan adheres to an open and clear policy with respect to Afghanistan on the basis of the principles of good-neighbourliness and non-interference in the countrys internal affairs. Uzbekistan shall further develop mutually beneficial and friendly ties with Afghanistan on a bilateral basis, and support the Government elected by the Afghan people themselves. We shall also continue to render practical assistance in restoring the economy of Afghanistan, taking into account the fact that economic well-being is an indispensable condition for ensuring peace and prosperity in that country. These principles and approaches towards Afghanistan are enshrined in Uzbekistans foreign policy concept, which has the status of law.Secondly, today a new global development agenda is under consideration at the United Nations. It must reflect the interconnection of human beings with the environment and contribute to supporting economic and social development while maintaining ecological sustainability. Uzbekistan attaches priority to sustainable development and ecological safety. We have recently adopted an action programme on environmental protection for 2013-2017, which serves as confirmation of that priority. The Government of Uzbekistan will allocate approximately $2 billion for implementation of the programme aimed at further maintaining decent conditions in the environment, the reasonable use of natural resources, and the introduction of the ecological basics of sustainable development in the economic sectors.consideration to national conditions and the various stages of development in the different countries, and respect their independent choice of development path. The agenda should give priority to strengthening global development partnerships; adhere to the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities, equity and respective capabilities; improve follow-up mechanisms; step up development financing; promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation; and increase official development aid and technical support to developing countries.China welcomes the positive outcomes of the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Doha in late 2012. China hopes that the developed countries will demonstrate political will and honour their commitments by scaling up emissions-reduction efforts and providing capital, technology and capacity-building support to developing countries. The Chinese Government takes climate change seriously, and the many forceful policy measures it has taken have resulted in notable progress. China will continue to play its due role in addressing global climate change.Time flies. We will soon be celebrating the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. Born out of the ashes of the Second World War, the United Nations embodies the yearning of the peoples of all countries for world peace and global development. The Chinese dream is a dream of prosperity for the country and happiness for the people; it has much in common with the dream of people across the world. As a responsible Member of the United Nations, China is ready to work with all other Member States to faithfully adhere to the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, faithfully carry out its historic mission and continue to make relentless efforts to advance the noble cause of peace and development for humankind."}}
