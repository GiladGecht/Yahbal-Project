{"speech":{"0":" Allow me at the outset to convey to all present the apologies of His Excellency Paul Biya, President of the Republic of Cameroon, who wanted to participate in the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly but was not able to owing for constraints relating to the national political calendar. He instructed me to read out the following message:“As President Ashe takes the reins of the General Assembly, the United Nations is entering a a full economic recovery, further strengthening the social sphere and generating new jobs. The borders with Afghanistans neighbouring countries should be considered the front line in combating drug-trafficking and, in that regard, efforts with respect to their logistical strengthening and the prompt creation of a modern and effective Afghan border police presence should be stepped up. There is an urgent need for Afghanistan to be fully included in the multidimensional regional cooperation process. Involving the neighbouring countries in the development of Afghanistan and giving due consideration to the regional context in the post-conflict rehabilitation of the country will guarantee success in the ongoing efforts undertaken by the world community.It is clear that illicit drug trafficking has become one of the major sources of financing of international terrorism. The urgency and magnitude of the problems associated with drugs and illicit drug trafficking are clear indications of the global danger threatening international stability and security as a whole. The international community must unify its efforts to reduce the supply of and demand for drugs and its efforts aimed at integrating national and regional efforts into the international drug-control strategy. During the period of its membership in the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs, 2014 to 2017, Tajikistan will strengthen and expand its interaction with other Member States and international and regional organizations in practical implementation of the international conventions on drugs and the Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem. Combating terrorism is a long-term and complicated joint task that will require strengthening by applying the entire spectrum of political, economic and financial measures. We deem it important to expedite the coordination and adoption of a comprehensive anti-terrorism convention. Regional and subregional organizations capable of providing support to the global system for combating international terrorism must play an important role in combating terrorism and extremism.In recent years, Tajikistan has intensified its interaction with United Nations law enforcement mechanisms, including the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. The countrys main priorities “We noted that, despite the progress, at the current pace of implementation very few countries would achieve all the MDGs by the deadline. With two years to go, we must point out that it will be difficult for Cameroon to achieve some of the Goals. Substantial progress has been made in reaching some of the targets. In the area of health care, which is considered to be the catalyst for economic and social development, with a view to reducing poverty, my country remains committed to the effort to combat the AIDS pandemic. The allocation of substantial resources to the fight against that disease, the distribution of free antiretroviral drugs, the effective care of the sick and the implementation of an efficient prevention programme, including the transmission from mother to child, have led to a considerable decline in the rate of HIV infection in Cameroon. From 10.5 per cent in 2000, the rate dropped to 4.3 per cent in 2012, a decline of more than 50 per cent. “Another genuine source of satisfaction for Cameroon is the progress made in the area of education. The Government has strived to continue and strengthen the numerous efforts to ensure primary education for all Cameroonians. I would underscore that the national target is to provide to all children — boys and girls — throughout Cameroon, the resources to achieve a complete primary schooling cycle. The implementation of the sectoral strategy on education has led to clear progress in the implementation of the education policy. I can mention, among other things, the expansion of school infrastructure, the improvement in the teacher-student ratio, the reduction in the number of students who repeat a school year and the improvement of girls education. The result of those actions is that the Cameroon today has one of the highest literacy rates in sub-Saharan Africa, with an enrolment rate of nearly 100 per cent. “But the same progress has not been achieved with respect to the targets of the other Goals. That is the case for most developing countries, including Cameroon. Hence the need to further our thinking that began in Rio de Janeiro in the context of the post-2015 development agenda and, as the President wished, to set the stage for the post-MDG development agenda. That thinking should be based on a clear assessment of the challenges encountered and lessons learned in the implementation of the critical period that should lead to the defining of the international development agenda that will follow the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Aware of his vast responsibility and the tremendous amount of work he will be facing during this session, I would like to convey to him the sincere congratulations of my country in connection with his election to preside over the Assembly and wish him every success in this challenging but rewarding undertaking. His vast experience in the area of diplomacy, which was made clear when he presided over the Commission on Sustainable Development and the Group of 77 and China, ensures a fruitful outcome to our present deliberations and to the work of the General Assembly for the 12 months ahead.“Those same qualities were the major strengths of his predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremic, and I should like here to commend his dynamic and effective presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.“Lastly, I would extend our sense of satisfaction to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his efforts in the service of peace and economic and social development worldwide.“This session is beginning in a context marked by the bloody terrorist acts committed in a mall in Nairobi, Kenya, several days ago. This is for me an opportunity to strongly condemn those acts of violence and to convey to the people and the Government of that brotherly country the deepest condolences of the people and the Government of Cameroon.“Let me, on a more optimistic note, welcome the end of the crisis in Mali, which resulted in the democratic election of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. The end of that process, which had the welcome support of the international community, represents a milestone in peacebuilding, security, national reconciliation and development in that country.“As I noted at the start of my remarks, throughout this session we must reflect deeply on the post-2015 development agenda. During the 2010 high-level debate, we noted that while progress made in achieving some of the MDGs, significant disparities persisted between countries and between regions. development. It is in that context that, in 2010, Cameroon crafted a strategy document for growth and employment. That document is part of Cameroons shared development vision to 2035, through which the economic performance of my country will lead to concrete results in terms of creating jobs, reducing poverty and significantly improving the living conditions of our people, especially for women and youth. “While the creation of decent jobs should, according to Cameroon, occupy a central position, environmental issues should not be neglected. In accordance with the spirit of Rio de Janeiro, those issues will make it possible to determine the future we want for humankind and to work seriously to bring it about.“To ensure that new development goals will be achieved by the established deadline, coherent national initiatives must be supported by an effective global partnership. Therefore, in addition to the provisions that may be taken at the international level by donors — increased pledges, concessional loans, debt swaps, debt restructuring and debt cancellation — and at the national level by developing countries, it is crucial that control be better maintained over the financial and raw materials markets in order to enable countries to better withstand external shocks.“We should also consider the possibility of setting up a support fund for implementing the new development programme, as well as regular follow-up mechanisms at the international and regional levels for achieving each goal. “Beyond the difficulties I have already noted, the MDGs, like the future international development framework, can be optimally achieved only if an appropriate security environment is ensured. Unfortunately, developing countries, and Africa in particular, continue to be a stage for many conflicts. “The situation in the Central African Republic, that in the eastern part of the Democratic Peoples Republic of the Congo and the turmoil following the crises of the Arab Spring in North Africa are all sources of concern that could jeopardize the development efforts undertaken by the States involved. With respect to the political, security and humanitarian crisis in the Central African Republic MDGs in order to consider the prospects for the future international framework. “The full implementation of the Millennium Development Goals faces structural difficulties for some and temporary difficulties for others. They include climate change, the financial crisis and food insecurity. Those difficulties raise a number of important questions about how the MDGs were formulated. Were we too ambitious? Was the 2015 deadline realistic? Would an effective follow-up and support mechanism for States not have been necessary? Did we give ourselves adequate resources to ensure implementation? Clearly, Millennium Development Goal 8 — ‘develop a global partnership for development — was the beginning of an answer to the last point. However, that Goal will also be difficult to achieve by 2015.“All the MDGs will probably not all be achieved by 2015. We should, however, acknowledge that the programme will enable the achievement of clear progress in many areas. It has allowed us to convey the very complex language of development in clear objectives accessible to all and enabled every one to articulate simple requirements and needs to their Government. We should safeguard those achievements in framework of the post-2015 agenda. “The post-2015 agenda should also take into account the viewpoint of developing countries, which are the primary targets. In that regard, I congratulate the United Nations for having initiated a broad and inclusive process of consultations to garner the views of all, in particular those of academics and civil society organizations, with respect to the MDGs and the framework that will follow them. Consultations of that kind have been held in Cameroon. They have enabled civil society to issue recommendations for the post-MDG framework. Those recommendations are in keeping with the MDGs in terms of strengthening the actions to undertake in order to provide universal access to primary education, to reduce maternal and infant mortality and to improve access to water and sanitation.“Furthermore, in the context of the next programme, my country believes that particular focus should be placed on creating decent jobs as an engine of economic growth and sustainable quickly as possible. I would here like to commend the assessment of the results of the summit by the United Nations and other strategic partners and their commitment to support the implementation of the resolutions Yaounde meeting.“As I pointed out on the occasion of the summit, in order to achieve the desired security objective, it will be necessary for all stakeholders to fully assume their role in the effective implementation of the instruments that the three organizations have put in place. As with the MDGs, the support of all of our strategic partners is crucial to effectively fight against piracy and other forms of insecurity in the Gulf of Guinea. “Anything that will promote the development of the region will contribute to improving global growth and security and represent significant progress towards ‘The future we want — a future of peace and prosperity for all.”"}}
