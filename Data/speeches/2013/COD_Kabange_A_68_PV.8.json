{"speech":{"0":" When the nations of the world come together in the General Assembly to consider the major issues facing humankind, it is an honour and a privilege to take the f loor and to express the viewpoint of ones country. Animated by those twin sentiments, on behalf of the Congolese people I address the Assembly and through it the community of nations as a whole.At the outset, I wish to express my most sincere congratulations to Mr. John Ashe on his election as President of the General Assembly at the sixty-eighth session. I also congratulate the members of his Bureau. I further wish to hail his predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremic, for the outststanding way in which he fulfilled his term as President. I would also like to pay well-deserved tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for all his initiatives for peace and security throughout the world and for his personal involvement in seeking ways and means to bring peace and stability to the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the entire Great Lakes region. His efforts are all the more commendable given the fact that the enemies of peace are always on the lookout, ready to strike anyone, anytime and anywhere, as we have unfortunately been recently reminded by the terrorist attack that brought such tragedy to the Republic of Kenya. On behalf of the Congolese Government and people and on my own will be able to address the emerging security challenges on the African continent. It is urgent to make operational the African rapid response force, proposed at the last African Union summit.In Guinea-Bissau, Senegal is supporting the Governments efforts to successfully carry out the electoral process. We urge our partner countries and institutions to pursue their support for the definitive resolution of the Guinea-Bissau crisis through the countrys economic recovery, the crucial reform of the defence and security sector, and the fight against illicit drug trafficking. We hope that similar attention will be paid to the Central African Republic and to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the legitimate aspiration to peace, stability and the preservation of territorial integrity. Throughout Africa, we are committed to upholding respect for the African Union principles against anti-constitutional changes of Government, regardless of the process used.In regard to the Middle East, Senegal expresses its deep concern over the untold suffering of the Syrian population. We urge the Syrian Government to exercise restraint and to comply with the Chemical Weapons Convention in the control and destruction of its arsenal of chemical weapons.In its capacity as Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, Senegal is following the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. It is a courageous and responsible act because it translates the vision of two States, Israel and Palestine, living within secure and internationally recognized borders. We therefore call for a halt to acts likely to affect that perspective, notably the ongoing establishment of settlements on Palestinian land by the Israeli Government.On 24 September, Senegal joined other countries in launching the international campaign for the fight against sexual violence in armed conflict. Sexual violence in conflict is an act of unbearable cruelty for the victims and their families. It is a war crime and a serious violation of human dignity and universal conscience. In the name of our common humanity, it is time to act to prevent and stop such horrors. It is time to act so that victims will no longer feel alone in their suffering, which destroys the very foundations of society. It is time to act so that the perpetrators and their accomplices in those crimes are tracked down everywhere, prosecuted and punished in a manner commensurate with the atrocities of their crimes. positive change, based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. In that respect, it is important to utilize the contribution of women, youth and civil society in both the design and the execution of the agenda. We should also draw lessons from the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals.With regard to climate change as an important issue to resolve in the post-2015 period, allow me to recall that, under the final document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (resolution ), States pledged to abandon unsustainable long-term patterns of consumption and adopt sustainable ways of managing natural resources as the basis for economic and social development and the very future of humankind. Climate change is a threat to humankind and fundamental human rights, particularly for vulnerable populations and especially those from the African continent and island countries. Seeking to limit its impact is, for each of our countries, a responsibility that we must shoulder as a duty towards our people, a service to the human race and an act of international solidarity.Recognizing that fact, the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country of exceptional biodiversity, has always sought to manage its natural resources with a view to the future. The management policy for of our forest ecosystems is aimed at that. The Grand Inga project has also been designed along those lines. We should emphasize, in fact, that that project should eventually enable us to produce enough electricity to meet the energy needs of nearly half of Africa. It will also be clean and renewable energy, consistent with the requirements of sustainable development.Today we must begin to set the stage for the post-2015 period. In that context, I express the hope that proposals will be made during this session to translate into reality our common desire to promote the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. Such proposals should cover our local, national and regional development programmes. They should also encourage bold international cooperation and reflect the will of each of our States to contribute to international peace and security.Without peace, no progress is possible. Without the minimum conditions for the safety of persons and property, all development is hypothetical. That is all the more unacceptable since a breach of the peace is the result of aggression. That is the sad recent history of my country.behalf, I condemn that despicable act. We express our condolences and solidarity with the brotherly people and leaders of Kenya.We welcome the Presidents choice of theme for this general debate, namely, “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. He mentioned the equally relevant need to draw lessons from the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, consider new and emerging development challenges, create measurable indicators, establish new types of partnership and better integrate the economic, social and environmental aspects of sustainable development. The importance of the theme chosen and the relevance of the indicators that accompany it are undeniable. Our thinking must be even more rigorous, as we witness several troubling elements in the international environment.With respect to organizing for the post-2015 period, the international community is increasingly witnessing non-compliance on the part of certain Members with the basic principles of international relations, persistent selfishness on the part of States and convulsions in the global economy. The consequences are manifold. They range from threats to peace to deadly conflicts and from globalization driven mainly by the unbridled pursuit of profit to the aggravation of poverty. That comes in addition to the food crisis, famines, diseases — including endemic diseases that had once disappeared and are now reappearing — and environmental destruction, which is the main cause of climate change and its deplorable effects.To remedy the situation, the General Assembly has established several bodies, and I welcome their creation: the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals, the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing and the high-level political forum to promote the implementation of recommendations and decisions on sustainable development. My hope is that that process will be consistent with the ongoing transformation of the Economic and Social Council and, beyond that, of the entire United Nations system, in order to better integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development, namely, the economic, social and environmental dimensions, in the new post-2015 agenda.The new programme that we are called upon to create must be universal, ambitious and able to meet the huge challenges facing humankind. It must bring about the United Nations. It is clear that denouncing violations of those principles is a good thing, but punishing those who violate the principles is preferable by far, especially when those violations are ongoing and recurrent.I cannot conclude my remarks without expressing my thanks to the Southern African Development Community, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, the African Union and the European Union for their essential role in maintaining peace in our region. I also thank the United Nations, in particular the members of the Security Council, and all of those States that have, for many years, remained at our side in order to ensure peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We are all the more thankful to them, as they have participated in one of the breakthroughs of the post-2015 development agenda aimed at ensuring a better world for all.We must be convinced that beyond our differences lies a common future. Our diversity must be seen as the essential source of wealth that it is. It is high time that we, the international community, find the ways and means to enable millions of people to not simply live, but to live a life of dignity in a world where peace, security and justice are a reality for all."}}
