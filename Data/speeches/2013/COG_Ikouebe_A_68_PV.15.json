{"speech":{"0":" At the beginning of this week, at the opening of the general debate, the international community strongly condemned the heinous attacks that have once again struck Kenya. That situation should lead us to reflect on our ability to prevent, manage and settle conflicts. Kenyas tragedy is to be situated near the territory of Somalia, which for too long has been left to terrorist groups. The lesson is to avoid the creation of any vacuum that could serve as fertile ground for subversive movements. That is why in Central Africa the member States of the subregional community have reacted quickly to the risk of the “Somalization” of the Central African Republic ever since the beginning of the crisis there, despite our limited resources.The dialogue on the humanitarian crisis in the Central African Republic that we, the partners of that ravaged country, held recently in New York, on 25 September, clearly indicated that the international community has taken stock of the challenge and has decided to resolutely provide assistance to the Central African Republic on the political, security, humanitarian, economic and financial levels, and to ensure that it has a successful transition, like that of Mali, a country which we commend and which deserves all our attention and solidarity today as it did yesterday.Therefore, beyond the humanitarian emergency, the Central African Republic must be given all the resources necessary to restore the authority of the State, enable its Administration to operate, revive the economy and prepare for elections. An international support mission in the Central African Republic is being established under African leadership. We encourage the Security Council to swiftly adopt a resolution supporting that initiative, which is aimed at creating the necessary conditions to restore peace and security, which would ensure the much-needed stability and the effective implementation of the transition road map. As a mediator and as chair of the follow-up committee of the Economic Community of Central African States on the situation in the Central African Republic monitoring that crisis, the Congo can only welcome that very encouraging development.It goes without saying that a nation that was built by claiming its lands from the sea is concerned when rising sea levels might endanger that claim. Therefore, we feel a strong solidarity with other countries that are threatened in the same way. The Netherlands wants to strengthen the synergy between climate and poverty-reduction policies, particularly in the field of water and food security.Exactly 75 years ago today, British Prime Minister Chamberlain said, in a radio address on the Sudetenland crisis,“How horrible, fantastic, incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas-masks here because of a quarrel in a far away country between people of whom we know nothing.”Czechoslovakia was dismembered shortly afterwards. That was not just the fault of the signatories of the Munich Agreement. The entire international community — especially Czechoslovakias fellow democracies in Europe, including my own country, the Netherlands — looked the other way.Today we can no longer pretend to know nothing of quarrels in faraway countries or of the people who live there. If we fail, it is not because of the deficiency of the legal instruments that we have developed. It is because of the international communitys deficient sense of responsibility. It is our duty to take responsibility in addressing the crisis in Syria.The Secretary-General talked earlier this week about leadership and identified Nelson Mandela as a shining example. I wish we would all listen to “Madiba” more often. On Syria, we should follow the Secretary-Generals lead and make peace and justice a reality.Investing in the United Nations is an investment in our common future. We are shareholders with a long-term interest. We need to have the instruments for peace, justice and development ready for the moment that they can help avert catastrophe. That is why we invested in the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which has now proved crucial in the Syrian crisis. That is why we should invest in the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Security Council. That is why we should work as hard as we can to come up with a clear and ambitious post-2015 sustainable development agenda. We are all in this together; we should invest together in our United Nations. With regard to the situation in Syria, my delegation strongly condemns the use of chemical weapons and welcomes the Syrian Governments adherence to the Chemical Weapons Convention and its decision to place its stockpile of chemical weapons under international control for destruction. Nevertheless, we believe that only a political solution can put an end to the martyrdom of the Syrian people and the fratricidal war that has already killed more than 100,000 people. That is why the Congo welcomes the United States-Russian agreement and the discussions under way in the Security Council on the adoption of a resolution that would mark the first steps in a process that will, we hope, in the near future, bring together the Syrian actors and all parties involved around a table in the framework of a conference for peace in Syria. In that regard, once again, we believe that the focus must be placed on finding a peaceful solution.At the same time as Syria is agreeing to eliminate its stockpile of chemical weapons, it is appropriate to recall one of the most serious threats to humankind — the nuclear danger. It is indeed urgent for the nuclear-weapon States, as well as for those that have other weapons of mass destruction, including biological weapons, to implement concrete measures enabling the elimination of those arsenals and making progress towards real disarmament, while ensuring respect for the prohibition of nuclear proliferation for military purposes. This is also the moment to commend the overtures made here by Iran concerning its nuclear programme.Last year, the Congo supported the General Assemblys historic decision to confer United Nations non-Member observer State status on Palestine. It was a symbolic act that the Assembly welcomed almost unanimously. The new American initiative designed to relaunch the Israeli-Palestinian talks also deserves the support of the entire international community. Here too, the Congo encourages dialogue and rejects any recourse to force or violence.Given the current series of political crises and in the spirit of peace and justice, how can we fail to ask that the embargo unjustly imposed on the Cuban people for five decades be lifted? That unilateral decision is contrary to the principles and values of the Charter of the United Nations and to international order, based on non-interference in a States internal affairs and peaceful cooperation.Also in the context of my countrys neighbourhood, by participating in the signing of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region, which took place on 24 February, President Denis Sassou Nguesso reaffirmed his commitment to a foreign policy aimed at peace and security in the world in general and in Africa, particularly in Central Africa and the Great Lakes Region. In doing so, he favoured the quest for peaceful solutions and showed his willingness to continue along that path. The various consultations he has initiated in the context of the implementation of the Framework agreement and the appeals directed to him demonstrate his approach.In that spirit, the Congo is pleased with the conclusions of the Second Meeting of States Parties to the Framework Agreement, which was held in New York on 23 September. We commend the leadership of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, while we call for those efforts to culminate in talks in Kampala.Just two years ago, we welcomed the wave of popular uprisings — the so-called Arab Spring, which led to the fall of some political regimes in the Arab world, sometimes by force of arms. We welcomed those movements, just as we welcomed the enormous changes that transformed the European landscape after the fall of the Berlin wall, in 1989. Today, in view of the developments in some of those countries, whose populations aspired and still legitimately aspire to freedom, democracy and social justice, I cannot fail to recall the remarks that I made from this rostrum during the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly (see ). I called then for greater caution and prudence, convinced that the overthrow of a political regime does not necessarily bring freedom and democracy, since they must be won and nurtured by other victories that cannot be imposed from the outside.The situations we have just mentioned are replete with lessons, not just because of the internal instability that may result from them, but also and above all because of their unpredictable negative impact on regional and international peace and security.It that regard, I shall mention other challenges to international peace and security, particularly those of the Syrian tragedy, which is unfolding relentlessly before our eyes, and the untenable Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has consumed so many human lives and so much energy and time. Congo has also benefited from substantial debt relief after reaching the completion point for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative in January 2010 and will from now on have more resources available for national development programmes, particularly in the social sectors.Structural reforms undertaken through the Extended Credit Facility of the International Monetary Fund have enabled us to make essential progress in managing the public finances and macroeconomic stabilization. The business climate continues to improve. Other measures have been taken to enable the Congo to speed up its achievement of the MDGs between now and 2015.The 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) outlined for us “The future we want”. Ambassador Ashe, who was one of the co-facilitators of the Rio+20 process and is now the President of the General Assembly, is therefore well placed to help us to set the stage that will enable us to reach the horizon that is the future we want. “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” is the theme of the current session. It invites us to establish the foundations for another vision of development, focused on poverty eradication and human development. My delegation agrees with the President that what is needed is an ambitious, bold programme that takes new and emerging development challenges into account and that better integrates the economic, social and environmental aspects of sustainable development.The Congo, a country in the forested Congo basin, can only concur with that view. The Congos commitment to sustainable development at the national level, as well as at the regional and international levels, has been unflagging. It is in that context that, after having spoken for Africa throughout the Rio+20 process, the Congo has continued its active commitment within the framework of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals. Once those sustainable development goals have been defined, there remains the vital issue of how to finance sustainable development, which will be tackled by establishing a committee of experts on the issue.It is regrettable that the issue of climate change, which affects all humankind, is still suffering from a lack of consensus. Permit me to revisit a subject of deep concern for developing countries such as ours, namely, the issue of financing the fight against climate change, which should be a central element in our negotiations. For our part, we affirm the importance of supporting The damage done by the economic and financial crisis that recently shook the world is far from being repaired; even if here and there we can see some signs of recovery, they are unfortunately not capable of relaunching sustained growth. The progress that about 40 developing countries have made has definitely led to some rebalancing of power, as the Human Development Report 2013 of the United Nations Development Programme indicates. However, the fruits of that growth are unequally distributed. Similarly, the disparities both within countries and between rich and poor countries once again raises the problem of inequality and social justice, which often causes social unrest. Between now and 2015 there will be numerous African countries that will not meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).For my own country, there has been significant progress in achieving the MDGs, especially those relating to education and maternal and child health, thanks to my Governments efforts and initiatives in areas such as abolishing school fees, providing free textbooks, recruiting teachers and providing free Caesarean sections, vaccinations and antiretroviral treatments. However, progress has been somewhat slow in fighting poverty and promoting decent jobs. Nonetheless, combating poverty remains a major concern to which my Government accords high priority through investment programmes in health, education, professional training, infrastructure, agricultural production, forestry and mining.We have reasons to hope for progress between now and 2015. The national context is being prepared. The Republic of the Congo enjoys reassuring stability and a favourable economic environment. Lasting peace has been established. We are consolidating the democratic process, which is strengthened by a regular dialogue between the Government and the opposition on organizing peaceful elections. My country has also built a harmonious overall framework for implementing its development policy, focused on modernizing and industrializing the country on the basis of our national development plan for 2012-2016.The favourable rise in the price of petroleum products and other natural resources such as wood has enabled my country to register significant increases in its economic growth rate, now over 5 per cent per year since 2010, allowing for inflation. That economic improvement has notably benefited State revenues, which have been going up steadily. The Republic of the As President John F. Kennedy noted as early as in 1963, at the eighteenth session of the General Assembly,“The United Nations cannot survive as a static Organization. Its obligations are increasing as well as its size. Its Charter must be changed as well as its customs. The authors of that Charter did not intend that it be frozen in perpetuity.” (09, p. 7)We are therefore at the heart of an important and timely debate.United Nations reform is therefore urgent and possible. It must be based on the principles of democracy, justice and equality. In that regard, the cycle of the intergovernmental negotiations on the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the Council should lead, through a consensual framework, to concrete results. That reform is part of the will of the Member States to make the Organization an institution that expresses the values of modernity and is open to the future, a sanctuary for builders of the future of the world, a world where planetary challenges require concerted global solutions, a world that is being built on the bedrock of solidarity, unity, mutual respect and tolerance"}}
