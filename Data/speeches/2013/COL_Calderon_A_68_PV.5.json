{"speech":{"0":" I should like to depart slightly from protocol and start my statement by speaking about a humble woman, a Colombian named Maria Zabala, who has to bear the burden of immense pain in her heart day in and day out. Two decades ago, armed members of illegal groups arrived outside her house located on the Colombian Caribbean coast, determined to impose their rule of terror. In front of her and her small children, they murdered her husband and two other relatives. They forced her to leave her house and then they burned everything down. She barely managed to remove the corpses from the ashes. She buried them right there and f led from her parcel of land with her children and without any belongings. All she carried was the immense weight of her tragedy.Today, Maria Zabala is a courageous and inspiring leader, a leader of victims, who is working for peace in my country. In Colombia, sadly, there are many thousands of cases like Maria Zabalas. It is estimated that over the past 50 years, over 220,000 people died because of the conflict. That is more than twice the death toll of the Bosnian war in the former Yugoslavia, which was an open and ruthless conflict that moved the honesty and seriousness, and that is what we are doing in Colombia.We have adopted an integrated strategy for transitional justice that addresses the issues of truth, justice and reparations, which we hope will enable us to make the transition towards peace. We can say that we have been pioneers in the implementation of transitional justice measures in the midst of conflict, giving priority to satisfying the rights of victims. No one in my country wants the perpetuation of violence.What we are asking from the United Nations and the international community is that both Colombias and every nations right to seek peace be respected We ask for continued support in that effort, along with respect for our decisions and our approach, with confidence in the fact that our actions have never deviated from the values of the international community.We cannot investigate every action committed over half a century of violence, prosecute each and every one of those responsible and then find ourselves unable to follow through. But what we can do is to build a realistic and transparent strategy that may satisfy the rights of all the victims in the best possible way. If we understand justice and the fight against impunity in a transition as a set of measures aimed at satisfying the victims and not just as the administration of criminal processes, it will be possible to find a comprehensive solution for everyone. I refer to measures such as genuinely establishing the facts of events, the acknowledgment of responsibility, the recovery of trust, access to reparations, and measures aimed at ensuring that there will be no recurrence. In that way justice becomes — as it should be — a support for, rather than an obstacle to, peace.I want to be clear: there will be no impunity for crimes against humanity or war crimes committed in a systematic fashion. On the contrary, this is the first time that Colombia is seriously assuming the obligation of fighting impunity for crimes committed in our armed conflict. The purpose is not to sacrifice justice to achieve peace, but rather to achieve peace with maximum justice. I am saying that out of deep conviction. There is much at stake, that is, no less than an end to the half-century long conflict, as well as the fate of 47 million Colombians.We have been involved in talks for one year now, but we have reached agreements on just one of the six items on the agenda. I am still optimistic, but of the same nation against each other and delays our development. Maria Zabala is one victim among many, all of whom are entitled to justice, truth and reparations and to not seeing history repeat itself. That is what we are working on in our country.My Government has promoted our most ambitious bill yet, recognizing and compensating victims in the midst of a conflict. I had the honour of ratifying that bill in the presence of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. But our commitment goes beyond serving the victims of the past; our most urgent obligation today is to eliminate the possibility of new victims being claimed by the conflict. Our obligation is to end the conflict now and to ensure that the spiral of violence and pain will not continue to recur. We are doing that in accordance with our democratic tradition — of course respecting, as we always have, the rule of law — and in compliance with our international obligations. We wish to achieve an end to our conflict without relinquishing justice, much less the truth and due care of the victims. I take this opportunity to offer my thoughts to the General Assembly on the role of the United Nations and the multilateral organizations in our peace process and its future implementation. The subject is relevant and current, since Colombia is possibly the first country in the world to engage in a process of that nature since the entry into force of the Rome Statute, which will make us a model for other cases where dialogue is given priority over armed solutions, as should be the case. Former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour of Canada recently stated that international doctrine had not been successful in finding practical answers as to how to resolve the real tension that exists between peace and justice in a negotiation process. Ms. Arbour recalled examples, such as International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, which had been given immense resources but had yielded very poor results.The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, established in 1994, has managed to dispose of only 40 cases out of the nearly 800,000 murders committed in a single year. In 20 years, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has resolved barely 100 cases.Therefore, how can we simultaneously achieve the end of armed conflict, fulfil our obligation to investigate and prosecute and realize the rights of victims? That dilemma must be confronted with all universities and think tanks, and in the context of different forums, not just from Latin America but from the whole world, because it is a global problem that requires a global solution. Because of that — because it is a global problem — we expect their conclusions to also be discussed in this body, the United Nations, which has already called for a special session on the drug problem to be convened in 2016. If we act together on the drug problem and adopt a new, modern and comprehensive vision that is free of ideological or political bias, imagine how much harm and violence we will be able to prevent. I am not just speaking about harm to people, but also harm to nature, because drug trafficking has become a major destroyer of our tropical forests and forests in general, in what can be termed a veritable ecocide.Colombia is deeply committed to environmental protection. At the Rio de Janeiro Conference on Sustainable Development, we put forward the proposal to establish sustainable development goals as a mandatory benchmark in the development agenda for the coming decades. We are taking an active part in the design of those goals, and they can and should be incorporated into a visionary and ambitious development agenda for all countries as of 2015. In fact, we were a member of the High-level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, convened by the Secretary-General and co-chaired by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron, which has already presented its report. Colombia, for its part, is continuing to do a great deal. For example, a few weeks ago, we doubled the area of the largest national park in Colombia, the Chiribiquete National Natural Park, located in the very heart of our Amazon region. We designated that area a natural reserve and prohibited mining and deforestation activities in an area roughly the size of Belgium, and not just in any place, but in the area where the Amazon region has the greatest biological and cultural diversity. This very morning we are launching, with the Prime Minister of Norway and five other countries, the New Climate Economy initiative. With the support of the most respected research institutes, we will seek the best way of making economic efficiencies and the fight against poverty compatible with the preservation of the environment. In that way we are shouldering our responsibilities with respect to climate change, which has already had an impact on Colombians. We will the patience of the Colombian people is not infinite. The guerrillas will have to decide whether they opt for an honourable and lasting peace, or whether they will continue to wage war. From this rostrum, I call upon them to understand that history has led us to this decisive moment. The time for decisions has come. If we leave empty-handed, we will doom our nation to many more years of bloodshed and pain. We cannot miss this opportunity.Future generations and history will not forgive us.Moreover, our conflict, with all its violence and cruelty, has been affected by a poisonous scourge that fuels it and is fuelled by it: drug trafficking. That illicit activity has been the main funding source for violence and terrorism in my country — and I would say in the whole world as well in recent times. Without the grim influence of drug trafficking, which fuels the fires of our war, I am certain that the war would already have ended. That is why we have included the topic of illicit drugs as a specific item in the agenda of the discussions with the guerrillas.If we manage to have the guerrillas change sides, once they have demobilized, and become an ally of the State in order to definitively curb drug trafficking and eliminate illegal crops, just imagine what could be accomplished. A Colombia without coca crops and without a conflict was once a utopia and an impossible dream, but it is one that we can now realize for the benefit not only of Colombians but of the whole world.Almost a half century ago, in this very place, the Convention that gave birth to the war on drugs was adopted. Today we must recognize that that war has not been won. I say that as the President of the country that has suffered the most deaths, the most bloodshed, the most sacrifices in that war, and also the country that has achieved the most results in the fight against this scourge and the mafias that underpin it. Last year, when chairing the Summit of the Americas, fully aware of that dilemma, I led a proposal to debate and explore different scenarios in the fight against the global drug problem, aimed at evaluating what we are doing and at seeking ways to be more effective. We commissioned the Organization of American States to conduct studies with experts, academics and people with different approaches on how to face the problem. Those studies were delivered to us in May. Different Governments are evaluating them and they should serve as inputs for discussions at to dedicate their efforts to finding solutions to the issues of poverty, hunger and sustainable development in a way that goes beyond simply convening conferences and adopting resolutions, and even beyond the necessary collective attention and campaigns that are called for from time to time, important as they might be.Recently, the Arab region has experienced many historic events and accelerating change. It has witnessed turbulent events arising from popular movements and their forceful entry into the public and political arenas.Stalemate continues to characterize the Arab-Israeli conflict. That conflict is at the forefront of the issues threatening international peace and security, owing to the continued Israeli occupation and the injustices inflicted upon the Palestinian people, as well as the failure to reach a just and lasting peace in accordance with resolutions of international legality. The continued Israeli occupation of Palestinian and Arab territories cannot be accepted as normal. Its practices include the changing of the demographic conditions in those territories, particularly through the expansion of settlement activity, the Judaization of the city of Jerusalem, the unjust embargo against the Gaza Strip, and intensification of settlement activities in the occupied Syrian Golan and changing its status quo and demographics. This is not simply because such actions represent f lagrant violations of international laws and covenants, but also because the Palestinian cause is a just cause and the historical injustice inflicted upon the Palestinian people must end.The major international bodies were established on the basis of the right to self-determination in the aftermath of two world wars. It is unreasonable that they cannot do anything about the last remaining colonial issue in the world. Israel should realize that coercion and de facto policies do not bring security. It is wrong for it to establish a State that believes that the prospect for peace lies in subjugating other peoples, denying their rights and making that a priority over peace. There can be no security without peace. True peace can come about only through coexistence among peoples on the basis of good-neighbourliness, mutual respect and respect for the interests of all. The peace we desire is built upon dignity, justice and the principles of international legality, as well as United Nations resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative, the principle of a two-State solution and the withdrawal of Israel protect the sources of oxygen and water necessary not just for Colombias survival but that of the entire planet.I will conclude by stating that in my country we are working and will continue to work to prevent the plight of Maria Zabala and millions of other victims from ever recurring. Never again! I hope that the President of Colombia will come to the Assembly next year bearing the good news that the conflict has come to an end."}}
