{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, let me convey to the United States authorities our full gratitude for the always warm and fraternal hospitality they show us at this great annual event in New York at the United Nations. I also express my sincere congratulations to the President, and I wish him every success and an excellent conduct of the work of the Assembly at its sixty-eighth session on the post-2015 development agenda. Finally, on behalf of my delegation and myself, I join the other heads of delegations present in the Hall to express my full gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon for his willingness to serve our world with the commitment and self-sacrifice for which he is known. At a time when the world is facing the most serious kinds of crises, blind barbaric terrorist acts, which we strongly condemn, have just been perpetrated in Kenya, claiming dozens of innocent victims, including women and children. At a time when armed conflicts are challenging our common abilities to build a world where peace reigns, the crisis that has been evolving in Syria for two and a half years, with its litany of distress and human tragedy, should call on us to reach an early settlement of the conflict and put an end to the suffering of the Syrian people. We strongly condemn the use of chemical weapons in Syria against innocent populations, just as we vigorously condemn the perpetrators of that horrible act. Let me formally draw our attention to other crises and other evils that, while they may appear to us to be minor or insignificant, are also every bit as serious. They are serious particularly because they lead to a heavy loss of human lives and, for those who live with them daily, they frequently give rise to frustration, scorn and a sense of abandonment. At the same time, those other evils actually should not even exist, because it was together in the United Nations that our predecessors unanimously, in a spirit of the equality of peoples, universal justice, fairness and humanism, decided with an open heart and free spirit to make humankind more harmonious for the well-being of our species. Indeed, it was our Organization that decided to decolonize all territories under the colonial yoke. It set the rules, laid out a path, and supported the peoples to be freed. Let me also pay tribute to the permanent members of the Security Council and to all States Members of the United Nations for the responsible attitude they completion of the treaty that will renew and reinforce our relationship.Palau would also like to acknowledge the significant support we have received over the years from our friend Japan. We are hopeful that expansion and reform of the Security Council will result in permanent membership of the Council for Japan. In addition, we would like to thank the Republic of China on Taiwan for its friendship and economic support in helping Palau to achieve its Millennium Development Goals and move on to the post-2015 development agenda through grants and technical assistance in the areas of infrastructure, food security enhancement and human capacity. We strongly support Taiwans expanded participation in the United Nations system, acknowledge the expansion of its meaningful participation in United Nations specialized agencies and mechanisms, and call on the United Nations system to accept Taiwans participation as a valuable contributor to our collective efforts.Beginning with the leadership of those assembled here, and working down to every level of international action and cooperation, we can respond, in a timely and expedited fashion, to the real emergencies we face. But the time for excuses is over. It is now time for leaders to lead."}}
