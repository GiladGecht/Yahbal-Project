{"speech":{"0":" Exactly 40 years ago, the two German States joined the United Nations. For Germans, that marked our full return to the community of nations. Germany supports the United Nations as the beating heart of a global order rooted in cooperation, peaceful compromise and cooperative solutions.The world has changed dramatically since then. New centres of economic and political power are emerging. In recent years, Germany has established new strategic partnerships with the new global players in Asia, Latin America and Africa.The setting of our meeting today is different from the usual one. The United Nations is undergoing renovation, which must not be restricted merely to the buildings. The United Nations must reflect the world as it is, not as it used to be. Only then will it be fit for the challenges of our age. A Security Council without permanent seats for Africa and Latin America does outcomes of the recently concluded high-level special events on the MDGs and on disability and development during the sixty-eighth session.Papua New Guinea is unlikely to achieve most of the MDGs by 2015. However, my Government remains committed to implementing the goals beyond 2015. We have tailored our Millennium Development Goals targets and indicators in accordance with our 2011 to 2015 medium-term development plan and the Vision 2050 policy framework. We are making progress in the areas of universal primary education enrolment, poverty reduction, reduced infant and maternal mortality rates, combating HIAIDS, tuberculosis and other health issues and strengthening gender equality and empowerment.Papua New Guinea expresses its appreciation for the support it has received from United Nations agencies and other development partners complementing our efforts to accelerate the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals.I am pleased to report on the continued progress in the implementation of the Bougainville Peace Agreement and the successful scaling down of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. We thank the United Nations, regional partners and the international community for their continued assistance in both instances.On international peace and security issues, Papua New Guinea remains concerned about conflicts and tensions in various regions of the world, including in the Middle East, North Africa, the Korean peninsula and the South China Sea. We urge all parties involved to defuse the situation through peaceful dialogue.We join the international community in condemning the use of chemical weapons in Syria and urge full compliance with the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention. We therefore commend the Security Council for adopting resolution 2118 (2013) with a view to dismantling and eradicating Syrias chemical-weapons programme.Since October 2011, Papua New Guinea has been contributing to United Nations peacekeeping operations in the Sudan and South Sudan. Earlier this year, we became the 148th State Member of the United Nations to join the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations. We are now looking at expanding and increasing our troop contributions. We also pay tribute beyond Syria. All the facts available to us show that the regime is responsible for the use of chemical weapons.The use of chemical weapons cannot be allowed to go unpunished. That we owe not only to the victims in Syria, but also to future generations. Those responsible for using such weapons must be called to account before the International Criminal Court, which must at last be able to begin its independent investigations. We welcome the agreement reached in the Security Council yesterday. The chemical weapons in Syria must be completely destroyed in accordance with a firmly agreed timetable. Germany is prepared to provide financial and technical help to destroy those chemical weapons. A world without weapons of mass destruction would be a better world.We must take advantage of the opportunity for a political process offered by the agreement on destroying the chemical weapons. After all, people in Syria are still being killed every day by conventional weapons. But there will be no military solution in Syria. Only a political solution can bring lasting peace to Syria. That would include an immediate ceasefire. I am pleased that there is at last a timetable for a possible peace conference, details of which still have to be clarified even after yesterdays decision in the Security Council. Only with a substantive political process can we counter the destabilization of the entire region.To date, Germany has made available more than €420 million to ease the worst of the suffering of the Syrian people. But despite all of the outside help, millions of Syrians are f leeing. Ever more people are at acute risk of starvation, and very soon they will also be at the mercy of the cold weather. They do not have even the most basic medical care. We must seize every opportunity to provide humanitarian access to the suffering population as quickly as possible. Amid all the devastation and hatred, the United Nations and its staff are the face of compassion and, for many Syrians, the only hope. I would like expressly to pay tribute to their work and commitment.The tragedy in Syria underlines the extraordinary and growing importance attached to disarmament aimed at eliminating weapons of mass destruction and the strengthening of the non-proliferation regimes. Attaining a world free of weapons of mass destruction is our generations prime task for the future. Disarmament is a crucial issue for the future of humankind.not reflect the realities of todays world. A Council in which the emerging and highly populous region of Asia is represented by only one permanent seat does not reflect the realities of todays world. Nor does it ref lect the reality of tomorrow. Germany, with its partners Japan, India and Brazil, is prepared to assume greater responsibility. In essence, it is a matter of strengthening the United Nations. The authority of the United Nations depends on its being representative.Mrs. Miculescu (Romania), Vice-President, took the Chair.We are seeking reform of the United Nations so that its power to build consensus, establish global rules and act effectively in response to crises and conflicts can be demonstrably strengthened. This is a call not only to the United Nations itself, but also to each and every individual Member State. Only if we are prepared to compromise and are willing to act together will we be able to make the United Nations strong. Germany remains committed to the United Nations. A strong United Nations is in Germanys interests.Our cultural differences and diverse traditions are not going to vanish in the age of globalization, but it is not only the worlds markets that are becoming ever more closely interconnected: peoples expectations, hopes and ideas are globalizing too. The developments in the Arab world have shown us that a countrys stability depends primarily not on the stability of the Government but on social stability. The best guarantees for a societys internal cohesion are respect for individual human rights, the triumph of the rule of law over the arbitrary, and broad economic, social and political participation on the part of the people. Germany is committed to democratic change and to respect for human and civil rights, not because we want to take the moral high ground but because we have learned from experience — from the painful experience of our own history.In Syria the people took to the streets to protest against a repressive regime. For more than two years now, the regimes response has been brutal violence, which has brought countless deaths, immeasurable suffering and terrible destruction on the Syrian people and is now jeopardizing stability in the entire region. The use of chemical weapons, ascertained by the United Nations, is a crime against civilization. Its terrible dimensions have consequences that extend far German foreign policy is a policy for peace. It focuses on crisis prevention. We Germans accept our responsibility for international peacekeeping. We focus on personal and social development. We focus on strengthening civil society. We want to contribute to a global process in which we — in the North, South, East and West learn from each other and develop joint solutions by working together. Germany will continue in future to use its economic clout and full political strength to promote peace and the balancing of interests.The digital age brings with it entirely new opportunities and challenges. We need an Internet in which freedom, security and the protection of privacy are appropriately reconciled. Just as we have to regulate international financial f lows in order to prevent global crises, so we need binding rules and standards for global data f lows. That is why Germany has submitted to the Human Rights Council an initiative regarding the protection of the right to privacy in the digital age. Everyone using the Internet should be able to be sure that their rights are being respected worldwide vis-a-vis private companies as well as vis-a-vis States. Not everything that is technically possible must be allowed to happen, nor is everything technically possible legitimate.Germany remains firmly anchored in Europe. Europe is a community of shared cultures, bound together by a common destiny. Close union among the nations of Europe is and will remain the response to our history and to our future in a world of change. German foreign policy is firmly embedded in European foreign policy. Europe will continue to use its clout, its influence and its resources to uphold peace and justice, to encourage development and cooperation and to promote climate protection and disarmament throughout the world.That is Germanys twin obligation: a strong united Europe in the world and a strong, effective United Nations for the world."}}
