{"speech":{"0":" It is an honour, Mr. President, for me to address the General Assembly. Things have changed since I was first here, and not only because time has passed and we have all become a little older — not that old age is a problem. The problem is how we approach it and, indeed, how we approach disability. That is why Ecuador believes that, in the context of the 2015 and post-2015 development agenda, we should include quantitative targets with measurable goals for persons with disabilities, together with international cooperation. Let us never again adopt a development agenda that fails to take account of persons with disabilities and their families. We must take specific measures to incorporate disability at the global, regional and national levels with a view to achieving verifiable results.As I was saying, things have changed since my first visit to the General Assembly Hall. Many words have reverberated within its walls, and ended up who knows where. Much has been said, and perhaps even the most patient among us is becoming a little exhausted. Our address, which may contain many impromptu comments, states things as we find them. I see, as others perhaps have, that every day it is becoming increasingly difficult to reach this colourful, cosmopolitan city. I do not think that is what its inhabitants want, for with their clamour they seem to be celebrating the diversity of the world that is characteristic of New York. It is in fact the bureaucrats that put obstacles in our way, drawing lines that are frequently difficult to cross.What shall we do in future years in the face of the obstacles that sometimes isolate the United Nations Headquarters? How can we, with the agreement of all, ensure that the Charter of the United Nations is Office for Central Africa and the United Nations Office for West Africa to be a strong presence in the quest for solutions to the problem, through the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of Central African States and the Economic Community of West African States on maritime safety and security.The summit that was held in Yaounde on 24 and 25 June led to the adoption of a code of conduct for the prevention and suppression of acts of piracy and armed robbery against ships and illegal maritime activities. The fight against those scourges calls for enhanced international cooperation, in particular among United Nations and regional and subregional organizations, in line with the Charter of the United Nations. However, regional and subregional organizations will not be able to effectively tackle those current major challenges if they are not granted substantial resources.The Syrian conflict continues with its atrocities and daily tragedies, which culminated in the use of chemical weapons on 21 August. The international community has long stood by, powerless, as the conflict has taken its gruesome toll. However, we express the hope that Security Council resolution 2118 (2013) will open up promising new prospects for peace and an inclusive political transition in Syria. That means that the international community must do more on the humanitarian front by providing aid to Syrians in need, both inside and outside the country. In that regard, we ardently hope that the holding of the “Geneva II” conference will provide an opportunity for ending the crisis through the establishment of a transitional Government based on consensus and an inclusive process.I cannot fail to mention the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by welcoming the resumption of direct negotiations between the two parties, thanks to the sustained efforts of President Barack Obama. Togo calls on the Israeli and Palestinian authorities to negotiate in good faith to reach, in the shortest possible time, an agreement that finally allows for the creation of two States living side by side in peace and security and within internationally recognized borders.The challenges facing our States are numerous and vast, but we believe in the ability of the United Nations to deal with them. It is therefore important that we re-establish the United Nations on the basis of the values that led to its creation, which are, essentially, the maintenance of international peace and security and the strengthening of international cooperation. excluding such other entities as the Human Rights Council.Because we believe that this is the forum in which to defend the right of all peoples to be respected, beginning with respect for their territorial integrity, we are reitereating, for the umpteenth time, that the time has come for the Israeli settlements to cease and for Palestine to be respected and recognized within the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.Along the same lines, we would like to make a democratic appeal: 188 of the Organizations 193 Member States have clearly stated that it is time to end the unjust embargo that the United States has imposed on Cuba. Cuba is part of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our Americas. Cuba is a member State of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. Cuba is part of the international community, and its people cannot continue to suffer the harmful consequences of that embargo.We also would like to reiterate our belief that dialogue can resolve the Malvinas Islands conflict. The United Kingdom must accede to what has been called for at the United Nations so often, that is, to sit at the negotiating table and leave the history of overseas territories to the shameful past. The Malvinas lie very close to Argentina, and quite far from the United Kingdom.Allow me briefly to mention that, in my country, we have recognized the rights of nature. We have to wager on different things. We must rein in the capacity to devastate of those who want unlimited growth even at the cost of ecological balances. Once disrupted, nature itself will restore those balances and all of us will be cast out, with not even a trace remaining of what we arrogantly call civilization.We have therefore decided to raise our voice against the high-handedness of some multinational firms — and in that regard have had the support of other Governments — whose unbridled pursuit of unlimited profit subjugates human beings for the sake of capital, damages the environment and violates human rights, all the while having us believe that it is possible to bring a State and its people to its knees.Ecuador has stood up to the defamatory campaign of one such company. In 2011, Chevron was ordered to pay $19 billion in response to the claim lodged by 30,000 inhabitants of my country who were affected by the devastating pollution that firm left behind in the respected? The host country, which is well aware how diverse the Organization is, wants to be the sole arbiter of who can come and who cannot, on the basis of its own likes and dislikes.That very powerful State has also taken it upon itself to spy on us, on the pretext of safeguarding its own security. It is true that human beings everywhere have lived through times of fear and terror. There is good reason to be vigilant. But the history of humankind, and consequently of the Organization, is in part the recording of an evolution in the rights of every one of us. We have been building and reinforcing rights that we consider to already have been established, such as the privacy and inviolability of communications. It is therefore regrettable that, at a time when technological advances have enabled every man and every woman to communicate with every other man and every other woman throughout the world, an Administration has set up a global surveillance system that knows no borders, that does not differentiate between friends and enemies and that fails to distinguish between criminals and law-abiding citizens.Let us be frank: it is not the existence of a system that intrudes upon the private life of every person in the world that surprises us. We all in fact suspected that such a system existed. No, it is its sheer scope that confounds us — a global espionage system that knows no limits, without even respect for the bounds of common decency, and without regard for the sovereignty of States and the right to privacy and freedom of expression of all citizens.It cannot be denied that the bonds of trust between States and Governments, which underpin negotiations, among other things, and effective agreements to combat international organized crime, including terrorism, have been seriously compromised by the unrestrained actions of the United States, which has taken it upon itself to spy on our communications. Many of the countries affected have requested, on behalf of their Governments and citizens, that the United States Government account for its universal espionage programmes, but have not to date received a satisfactory response.On numerous occasions, we have heard the representatives of the United States Government express to the United Nations their readiness to discuss the issue. My delegation is willing to initiate such a discussion forthwith, in a frank, clear and open fashion, and believes that there is no better forum for doing so than the Assembly and its Committees, without the use or the threat of the use of force and calls for respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States. As a State party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, we condemn the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic by any party. We also reiterate the obligation of States to refrain from providing any type of military support to non-State actors.Those are some of the topics that cause us major concern. There will be more, voiced by others, so that we can ultimately approach the world with hope and restore our human capacity to be able to continue believing in what inspired the establishment of the United Nations: dialogue for the sake of peace, as well as democracy, justice, inclusion and equality and as an antidote to war."}}
