{"speech":{"0":" It gives me pleasure to congratulate Mr. John Ashe and his friendly country, Antigua and Barbuda, upon his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremic of Serbia, for his efforts during the previous session.I reiterate our support to the Secretary-General as he strives to realize the purposes and principles of the Charter. I also welcome the choice of “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” as the main theme of this session, considering the high priority that the United Nations and the peoples of the world accord to the achievement of development in all its dimensions.Allow me to deviate from customary practice for a debate in the General Assembly by conveying to the Assembly a message that comes not only from the President of Egypt, Mr. Adly Mansour, but from the people of my country — the Egyptians who laid the foundations of human civilization and have recently inspired peoples around the world. Egypt holds a unique position in the history of humankind, past and present. Its status, role and influence derive essentially from its culture and civilization. It would have been a historical inconsistency had the will of the Egyptians remained shackled at the dawn of a new century, and had our youth remained deprived of the right to design their own destiny and future. It was therefore natural for our people to take to the streets on 25 January 2011 to declare their determination to build a democratic and modern State in which their children could enjoy freedom, dignity and social justice.This is the Egypt that millions of my countrymen and women chose then — the same Egypt they yearned for on 30 June 2013. In doing so, they showed the world that the will of the people cannot be broken and that it can grant authority, just as it can remove it from the hands of those who abuse it.The Egyptians have an ambitious vision for the future that can be achieved by working systematically in a reasonable time frame. Its success is based on a society that is open to all peaceful political currents, that pluralistically embraces the diversity of all its have not yet had a chance to serve on the Human Rights Council. We therefore hope to be able to count on the support of the Assembly in the elections for that body to take place in 2014. We accept and have implemented virtually all of the 86 recommendations that resulted from our experience in the Councils universal periodic review (UPR) of 2009. We will submit to a new UPR in 2014. If the Assembly invests its trust in us to elect us to serve for the 2015-2017 triennium, we will fulfil our mandate in the deep conviction that the United Nations human-rights-protection system should remain strong, independent, impartial and demanding, and that, in this regard, we should always resolve to aim higher. We will continue in the same vein as we approached our membership of the Security Council in 2011-2012, characterized by openness to dialogue and by a constructive and balanced attitude, and seeking to build bridges and generate consensus, without relinquishing values and fundamental principles.The Portuguese language is the common element of unity that brings together the diversity of States of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries. We are a Community of eight countries, with about 250 million speakers spread across four continents. Portuguese is the third most widely spoken European language in the world, with a growing role and status on the international scene, both as a vehicle of communication and as an economic language used in trade and business, culture and social networks.In October, Lisbon will host the second conference on the status of the Portuguese language in the international system, at which participants will consider the challenges faced by their common language. Portuguese is currently the official or working language of several international organizations, including some specialized agencies of the United Nations. The CPLP has the ambition and goal of seeing Portuguese adopted as an official language of the United Nations. I take this opportunity to salute the Mozambican presidency of the CPLP and its efforts to strengthen and deepen our Community.I conclude by wishing the greatest success for the General Assembly at this session. The Assembly can count on Portugals active contribution and support in upholding international law, promoting the peaceful settlement of disputes, defending and promoting human rights, and working towards greater prosperity for all of humankind. stronger ties of cooperation between our people and the rest of the world. Those relations should be based on the principles of independence, mutual respect and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and on a foreign policy founded on equality and a constructive, civilized vision for the future. Egypts foreign policy is now a reflection of the will of our people, and it is formulated in line with our national interests and security with no regard to any other consideration.We fully recognize that Egypts national security is linked to the security and concerns of our Arab nation. Given its geographical location, history and identity, Egypt is committed to continuing to defend the interests of its African continent, to address the issues of importance to the Islamic world, to spread the Islamic values of moderation and tolerance, and to promote dialogue among divine religions. Egypt also remains committed to tackling the challenges facing the South at a time when the world is witnessing an imbalance of power.I would now like to briefly highlight Egypts position on several issues of high priority in our foreign policy.In Syria, the tragedy has now extended to the resort to chemical weapons. We strongly condemn their use and support the agreement reached between the Russian Federation and the United States, as well as Security Council resolution 2118 (2013). While the humanitarian crisis resulting from the fighting continues to intensify, the Syrian State itself is on the verge of disintegration. It is imperative to reach a political solution as soon as possible that would establish the freedom, dignity and democracy to which the people of Syria aspire and preserve the unity of the State. We hope that can be achieved through the holding of the “Geneva II” conference, so that a transitional authority can be put in place to end the civil war and the foreign interventions that we have long warned against.The Palestinian question remains the main source of tension in our region. Palestine is still suffering the effects of the ongoing Israeli occupation of Arab territories and the intensification of settlement activities. The hope for achieving a two-State solution was until recently on the verge of fading away irrevocably. Given that bleak scenario, we welcome and appreciate the recent efforts of the United States to advance the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. The members, and that inclusively ensures the equal rights and duties of all citizens through the rule of law and equality before justice. The principles and practices of this vision are consistent with the fundamental rules that govern democratic practices throughout the world, in particular respect for peaceful dialogue, the rejection of violence, the rule of law and respect for human rights.Our conviction that Egyptians have the right to fulfil such a vision underpins the road map that Egypt has been implementing since 3 July. That road map includes a national agenda to build the institutions of a democratic State in a specific time frame. All Egyptians are invited to participate in all phases of the political process, as long as they are committed to renouncing violence and terrorism or incitement thereto.Work is under way, in line with the road map, on several tracks. To date, it has succeeded in establishing the principles of justice, freedom and democracy as bases for governance. Work is under way on the new constitution, to be followed by parliamentary elections and presidential elections, bringing the transitional phase to an end by next spring. We are determined to fully implement the road map. This requires us to give the utmost priority to preserving security, enforcing the law and countering any attempts to intimidate or humiliate us or hinder our efforts. Some parts of Egypt were recently hit by desperate terrorist attacks. Among their victims were Egyptians from all walks of life — men and women, young and old, Muslims and non-Muslims. Those hideous acts of terrorism sought to undermine the democratic process and to destroy our economy. I would like to emphasize and reiterate in the strongest terms our full confidence that the brave Egyptian people, who succeeded in imposing their will, can eradicate terrorism within the framework of the rule of law. I trust that the international community will stand firmly with the Egyptian people in the fight against those who commit or advocate for violence, and will accept no attempt to justify or tolerate it.I take this opportunity to convey my deep condolences to the Government and the people of Kenya and Pakistan on the loss of innocent lives as a result of the latest terrorist attack.The message I am carrying from Egyptians, particularly our youth, who are joining me here today and representing their ancient country, would not be complete without mentioning Egypts aspirations to enjoy more democratic international relations and Biological Weapons Convention. Syria must ratify the Biological Weapons Convention and take the remaining steps it has pledged to take in relation to the Chemical Weapons Convention. Egypt must ratify the Biological Weapons Convention and sign and ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, provided that all countries of the Middle East complete measures of accession to the international conventions prohibiting weapons of mass destruction and related arrangements and treaties.Thirdly, we must pursue international efforts to ensure that the delayed 2012 conference to establish a Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction is convened as soon as possible, preferably before the end of 2013 and by the spring of 2014 at the latest.Egypts roots go deep in Africa. We are proud of the many positive changes that Africa has witnessed and of the strides the continent has taken towards democracy and development. Yet Africa remains in need of concerted national, regional and international efforts to enable the continent to resolve its conflicts and challenges. Accordingly, Egypt will soon establish an Egyptian agency for development partnership. Most of its future resources will be directed to African countries so that they can benefit from Egyptian technical expertise and assets.We cannot talk about democracy in current international relations and the rule of law at the international level unless comprehensive and substantial reform of the United Nations takes place, so that the Organization is better able to respond to challenges and to meet the aspirations of peoples worldwide. The only logical and sound way to achieve that desired outcome is the reform and expansion of the Security Council. Egypt therefore renews its call for an end to the monopoly of permanent members over the decision-making process in the Council and for the rectification of the historical injustice inflicted on Africa. The continent does not have a permanent seat on the Council and is poorly represented in the category of non-permanent members. Africa will not renounce its demands to obtain the permanent membership it deserves, as specified in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.In conclusion, I would like to highlight our priority issues within the United Nations system. They include strengthening the international human rights framework, addressing the absence of democracy in international relations, accelerating the achievement of commitment of both sides to engaging in a process of time-bound negotiations is a significant development. We should all support the ongoing negotiations so that they may lead to the final settlement of the Palestinian question, which has continued since the past century.Egypt will continue to support the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the establishment of an independent and sovereign State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, on all the territories of the West Bank and Gaza and in accordance with the Arab Peace Initiative and the relevant terms of reference. I reiterate that the needs of the Gaza population must be met. The failure to do so has become politically and morally unacceptable. We therefore call on Israel and the international community to shoulder their responsibilities and ensure that the Palestinians in Gaza have access to basic supplies. We are ready to cooperate with the Palestinian authority and all concerned parties to agree on appropriate arrangements that guarantee the delivery of provisions in legal and transparent ways.The Assembly will agree that a new Middle East will not emerge until the right to equal security is ensured and the threats posed by the existence in our region of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction are eliminated. The situation threatens the credibility of the non-proliferation regime and the United Nations. For that reason, and to preserve that credibility, I would like to introduce to the Assembly today an initiative consisting of the following steps.First, we must invite all countries of the Middle East and the five permanent members of the Security Council to deposit official letters with the Secretary-General stating their support for declaring the Middle East a region free from nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction.Secondly, the countries of the region that have not signed or ratified any of the international conventions on weapons of mass destruction should commit, before the end of 2013, to simultaneously signing and ratifying the relevant conventions. They should also deposit documentation of their accession to those conventions with the Security Council. I invite the Secretary-General to coordinate such steps so that they are carried out simultaneously to ensure their success.Those actions translate into the following. Israel must accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a non-nuclear State, ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, and sign and ratify the Kyrgyzstan has done its part. That is reflected in the national sustainable development strategy of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2013-2017, which identifies five-year targets and plans for a transition to sustainable development, culminating in 2017. Our vision is to form a stable country where human rights, freedom and security are guaranteed, where a multi-ethnic society is governed with equal adherence to the rule of law, and where all prerequisites for sustainable economic growth and a decent standard of life are the norm. The tasks ahead are complex, and we believe they should be addressed in partnership with the United Nations and the international community.The main strategic resource for the green economic growth of Kyrgyzstan is water. The role of water has increased significantly due to the major challenge of sustainable development posed by global climate change, which is already affecting our region negatively. Most importantly with regard to the state of water resources, Kyrgyzstans glaciers have shrunk by 30 per cent as a result of global warming. According to preliminary expert forecasts, unless urgent measures are taken there will be practically no glaciers or snowfields on the countrys territory by the year 2100. Those melting waters are the primary source of the rivers of Central Asia.This ongoing negative trend may well lead to a substantial reduction of river f low in Kyrgyzstan, and consequently to social and economic tensions in the region as a whole. We must pursue our work in the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The relevant international financial and ecological organizations must continue to assist the countries of Central Asia in addressing the problem. That is particularly important in the transition to a sustainable use of both water and natural ecosystems resources.The development of hydro-energy is strategically important to the sustainable socioeconomic development of the region. We are convinced that it would contribute to an integrated solution of many current and future challenges. We believe that the construction of large hydroelectric power facilities should be considered one path to clean development. Harnessing the hydropower potential of the upstream countries should be considered part of low-carbon development, and developing water resources should be considered the core model for green development in the economic progress of the region. We are ready to participate in an exchange of the Millennium Development Goals, realizing nuclear disarmament and fighting corruption, including recovering the assets stolen by key members of the regimes recently brought down by our peoples. We reiterate that we are determined to continue empowering women nationally and internationally, to protecting human rights, and to allowing our youth to contribute effectively to the elaboration of Egypts vision for the world and for its future. I take this opportunity to welcome the appointment a few months ago by the Secretary-General of a Special Envoy on Youth who comes from the Arab world. We must also exert concerted efforts at the international level to combat terrorism and strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to coordinate those efforts and address the root causes of terrorism.In conclusion, I truly hope that the message I have delivered on behalf of the people and the President of Egypt has been received by the Assembly today. I also hope that the aspirations it identified will be realized so that we may achieve progress, peace and development and that next year we may reap the fruits of our labour. "}}
