{"speech":{"0":" Let me first join previous speakers in expressing my delegations deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of the victims and to the people and the Government of Kenya on the terrorist attack at Westgate Mall in Nairobi.It is almost two generations now since Eritrea first begun to lodge petitions for justice with this body. Sadly, in all of those instances, the Assembly has persisted in ignoring Eritreas pleas, shuttering its doors as a “closed monastery”. Those setbacks notwithstanding, Eritrea remains firmly convinced that the promotion of peoples rights and interests and mutual respect among the community of nations will remain precarious without an international body that upholds the supremacy of international law and justice. As such, our choice, like those of other peoples, has been and remains the funnelling of efforts towards expediting the reform of the United Nations.To focus exclusively on the harm done to the people and State of Eritrea may convey the false impression of an aberration in an otherwise effective and well-functioning United Nations. As it is, the particularity of our case only amplifies the wider backdrop of a United Nations debilitated by chronic weaknesses progress in broadening the sphere of individual and collective rights and freedoms, of preserving human dignity and of strengthening the protection of the rights of its citizens, especially the rights of women, children and persons with special needs.In its amended 2011 Constitution, the Kingdom of Morocco dedicated a chapter to respect for human rights as they are recognized internationally. Morocco has always desired to preserve a balance between its international and national commitments and priorities. As a founding member of the Human Rights Council, Morocco has participated effectively and constructively in the formulation and implementation of the institutional texts of the Council, in particular the universal periodic review. When it was decided to take another look at the rules and mechanisms in 2011, Morocco was given the task of conducting the negotiations on them. At the same time, the Kingdom of Morocco enjoyed positive cooperation with the various institutions and mechanisms and interacted with their recommendations, in particular the universal period review, treaties and special measures, whose assessments Morocco continues to welcome, facilitate and answer with its observations. Morocco hopes to gain the Assemblys support for its candidacy for the Human Rights Council for the period 2014-2016, in order to further contribute to strengthening the role of the Council and to ensure the effectiveness necessary for its operation.In that connection, we have recently launched an initiative relating to immigration, especially illegal migration. Morocco wished to establish other mechanisms for refugees in connection with how we address the issue and rights of immigration, especially illegal migration, and asylum. A few days ago, a new statute on immigration was enacted and the right to asylum, so as to give new rights and documents to political refugees. All of this is a very important development for our country.I would like also to touch on the key issue of the territorial integrity of Morocco and the issue of the Moroccan Sahara. For several years now our authorities have followed the diligent efforts of the Secretary-General and the Security Council to resolve the Sahara issue. Morocco complies with all Security Council resolutions and has acted in good faith with respect to those resolutions and to the efforts of the Secretary-General. The most recent resolutions called for a new round of negotiations among the parties so as to Monetary Fund, in order to control the global economy, leading to an intractable global financial crisis with lethal ramifications for the majority of the peoples of the world. We have also witnessed the misuse of the mass media and cultural centres in order to create false images and to promote decadent value systems, intimidate peoples and demonize any dissent; and the employment of various subterfuges in order to control, directly or indirectly, all international, continental, regional, governmental and non-governmental bodies. Those manifestations of the current world order can be corroborated, beyond abstract analysis, by numerous specific cases and evidence related to particular events, places and time. That is precisely why the twenty-first century requires a revitalized United Nations that transcends a bipolar or unipolar world order, and that is firmly rooted in the supremacy of, and respect for, international law and justice.As I have intimated, Eritrea, like other African States that were formed during the colonial scramble, should have attained its sovereign independence during the process of decolonization that transpired in the aftermath of the Second World War. The inalienable national rights of the Eritrean people were, however, compromised to serve the strategic interests of the United States, which had emerged as a triumphant Power. Eritrea was therefore doomed to colonial rule by proxy. The people of Eritrea had to endure colonial suppression for almost 40 years under successive regimes, which were propped up, alternately, by the United States for the first 23 years and by the former Soviet Union for the subsequent 17 years. The Eritrean people had to wage their liberation struggle under those conditions, which exacted heavy sacrifices from them to achieve their independence in 1991. That historical truth, coupled with other similar phenomena, illustrates the perils of a world order that is driven by the rivalry of domineering super-Powers, and highlights the need and urgency for an effective United Nations.The Eritrean people were neither compensated for the transgressions meted out to them nor given respite in the subsequent years. As they embarked on the arduous task of rebuilding their war-torn country, they again became pawns in the broader Horn of AfricMiddle East chessboard of domination and influence and have suffered unjust and distorted policies for the past 20 years. In that respect, border conflicts that do not have political and legal justifications and that were never raised prior to the independence of and shortcomings. In any event, my message today will focus primarily on the urgency of reforming the United Nations and redressing the injustices committed against the people of Eritrea as well as other peoples of the world.The negative experiences during the first 50 years of the existence of the United Nations and the paralysis and constraints under which the United Nations had to operate in the context of the realities of the Cold War in a bipolar world accentuated the need for structural reform of the United Nations at that time. In Eritreas case, our inalienable right to independence was trampled at the onset of the Cold War, since the country was perceived as a mere pawn in the overriding strategic rivalry of both super-Powers. Our liberation struggle was likewise suppressed by both super-Powers in an alternating fashion because of the same strategic considerations and shifting alliances.Yesterdays history is too fresh in our minds to induce in us any nostalgia for the Cold War. Our call for reform of the United Nations is thus not influenced by some innate preference for the return of the old, bipolar configuration to replace the prevailing unipolar world order. The fact is that the United Nations should have undergone incremental reform and revitalization during the 50 years of the Cold War. The end of the Cold War was certainly the most auspicious moment for undertaking that belated task.Indeed, it is now clear in retrospect that had such reforms occurred then, the wars and destruction that have unfolded in the past 20 years could have been avoided. However, the major Powers that controlled the General Assembly and the various institutions and agencies of the United Nations, through partial hegemony, felt after 1991 that they were better positioned to secure and consolidate their total domination of the United Nations. They blocked any reform of the United Nations, and so that historic opportunity for international peace and justice to prevail was lost.In the past 20 years, we have witnessed excessive control over global resources and the creation of spheres of influence, which has triggered international instability; the use of force and coercion as primary instruments for controlling global resources while preventing and denying others the opportunity to acquire comparable military capabilities and technology; and the deployment of international financial institutions, including the World Bank and the International reform of the United Nations. The fact is that the Assembly has legal, moral and historical obligations and responsibilities entrusted to it by the peoples of the world that it cannot shrug off.In conclusion, I urge the United Nations to adopt practical resolutions that are commensurate with its legal, political and moral responsibilities in order to, first, uphold the rule of law; secondly, bring to an end the invasion of our sovereign territories; thirdly, lift the unlawful and harmful sanctions against Eritrea; fourthly, terminate interventions that jeopardize the peace and stability of the peoples of the Horn of Africa; and, fifthly, deter all acts that breed crises, loss of life and destruction."}}
