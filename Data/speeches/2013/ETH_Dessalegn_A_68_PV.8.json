{"speech":{"0":" It is with great pleasure that I congratulate the President on his election to his high office to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session, which is being held under the theme: “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. I wish to assure the President of the full support and cooperation of my delegation in the successful discharge of his heavy responsibilities. I would also like to commend his predecessor for the able leadership he demonstrated during the previous session.Let me begin by condemning the terrorist attacks in Kenya that claimed the lives of innocent civilians and left many more injured. I wish to express my heartfelt condolences to the people and Government of Kenya, as well as to the families of the victims of that callous attack. That incident once again demonstrates the need for us to renew our commitment to fight terrorism and extremism in all its forms and manifestations.I am addressing the Assembly today not only on behalf of my country but also as the representative of the African Union (AU), which Ethiopia has the honour of chairing this year. It is a welcome coincidence that Ethiopia, which played host to the founding Conference of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), 50 years ago, has assumed the rotating chairpersonship of that premier continental organization at a time when its golden jubilee is being celebrated. We were very pleased to host the Special Summit of African Heads of State and Government, which marked the OAAU jubilee on 25 May, and I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to all those who sent delegations to Addis Ababa to take part in the celebration and conveyed messages of support and solidarity to the African Union. Since the fiftieth anniversary will be a year-long event, we would like to continue to mark the historic milestone during this session of the General Assembly by reflecting on the relations between the United Nations and the then Organization of African Union and todays African Union over the past half-century.When the Charter of the United Nations was signed in 1945, much of Africa was under the yoke of colonialism. Since then, our continent has been liberated from the remnants of colonialism and other forms of subjugation. Today, it is gratifying to note promoting development and to significantly improving in the quality of life of the people of Burkina Faso. As we approach the deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals, the theme of the current session, “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”, raises in a pertinant way the issue of the dialectical relationship between development, peace and security. It therefore offers us an opportunity to focus our thinking on a new vision in order to achieve comprehensive progress, based on strong international solidarity, towards sustainable development. That is why it is important that we redouble our efforts to regulate environmental issues on the basis of the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (resolution , annex), held in 2012 in Rio de Janeiro.Peace and stability appear as still-distant goals, given the number of centres of conflict throughout the world. That situation demands that we further strengthen multilateralism, rigorously apply the principles enshrined in the Charter of our Organization, strengthen the instruments for promoting those ideals and carry out the reform of United Nations bodies, in particular the Security Council. It is my hope that the General Assemblys work at this session will contribute to achieving those noble objectives for a more fulfilled and united humankind."}}
