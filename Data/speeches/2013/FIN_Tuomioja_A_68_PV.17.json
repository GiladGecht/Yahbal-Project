{"speech":{"0":" We have convened here in New York at a time that poses enormous challenges to the authority and credibility of the United Nations. First, we are at a crossroads where we have to decide the future course to attain sustainable development. Speaking for Finland at the Rio de Janeiro Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), I stressed that, faced with advancing climate change and the accelerating loss of biodiversity, we might, at best, have only a few decades in which to reach ecologically, socially and economically sustainable development. Decisive action based on a sense of urgency is needed to turn the tide globally before it is too late. Either we succeed in that together or we are going to perish together.This week, we have taken stock of progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. They have been a powerful tool to direct our action. In the near future, we are expected to agree on a new development agenda, a new set of goals that, in my view, could be called sustainable development goals. A green economy is not a luxury, but a prerequisite, for poverty reduction and sustainability. In short, the new agenda must be even bolder and more ambitious than the previous one. Its implementation will require action in all countries.Secondly, we are facing a failure of the United Nations to act in its core domain, that is, in maintaining peace and security. One hundred and ten thousand people have been killed and 2 million people have been forced to leave their homes in Syria, where a tragic civil war has been going on for more than two years. The United Nations has been unable to act to end war crime for which those responsible must be brought to justice through referral to the International Criminal Court. Finland welcomes the agreement reached on a strongly worded Security Council resolution to collect and destroy chemical weapons in Syria under international control. There can be no impunity for the perpetrators of war crimes and other atrocities. The agreement has to be followed through with a political solution to the conflict. That is the only way to stop the violence. That means negotiations. The international community, the parties to the conflict and especially the Security Council must take responsibility for working towards political negotiations. We continue to support the initiative of the United States and Russia of proposing the “Geneva II” conference, as well as the mediation by the United Nations and Arab League Joint Special Representative, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi. All permanent members of the Security Council must shoulder their responsibility.The humanitarian suffering of the Syrian people continues. We all must intensify our work to help the refugees and support the neighbouring countries bearing the heaviest burdens. The United Nations will also need to have a strong presence in Syria after the arms have fallen silent. Finland stands ready to contribute to a possible United Nations peacekeeping operation to be established in Syria.The resumption of direct final status negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis is long-awaited and most welcome news. Since the Oslo agreement 20 years ago, it has been clear that the best outcome for all the parties is a two-State solution, which can accomplish a reign of peace and security for the two peoples. We may still have at hand perhaps the last chance for such a resolution of the conflict. When I say “perhaps the last chance”, it is not because I think there may be more chances later, but rather it is because, at worst, the last chance may already have been missed. But it is our duty to make the effort to achieve a negotiated two-State solution.Finland commends Secretary Kerrys dedication and the personal commitment demonstrated by the parties. The entire international community must lend all its support for the negotiations to succeed. That must be concrete and effective support. The role of regional partners is crucial, and I welcome the efforts made by the League of Arab States in reviewing the Arab Peace Initiative.mobilization and management. Nations should mobilize their own resources through inclusive economic action and through responsible international trade and investments. Developing national taxation systems and tax-revenue collection, as well as addressing unregulated capital f light and putting an end to illegal tax evasion and tax havens, should be central elements in sustainable development financing. Our own national experience shows that taxation is an effective means of addressing inequality.Direct foreign investment can be a driver for growth and development. Investment should be sustainable, accountable and adhere to norms of corporate social responsibility in creating economic and social development. The current proliferation of bilateral investment agreements, already numbering in the thousands, is not the best way to manage investment f lows or set the rules they should follow. As part of our efforts to promote sustainable and fair financial governance, Finland supports efforts to create an international investment regime that is transparent, balanced and equitable.The sustainable development goals must be universal, and they must integrate different dimensions of development. Fears that sustainable development would challenge the traditional development agenda are unfounded. These agendas are not competing, but complement each other. We must do our utmost to agree on a new way to sustainable development in the very near future. Our planet and its citizens cannot wait. We, the States Members of the United Nations, are shouldering a great responsibility in that respect. We must be able to deliver as the United Nations.We also have more traditional security challenges at hand. The conflict in Syria has seriously undermined the authority and credibility of the United Nations. The United Nations has not been able to act in its core domain in maintaining peace and security. Both the Syrian Government and the international community have failed to implement their responsibility to protect.The situation in Syria started as a peaceful and justified call for reforms. The Governments response then turned it into an increasingly violent conflict and a breeding ground for terrorist extremism. That has led to humanitarian suffering, which has already reached historic proportions. The use of chemical weapons on 21 August near Damascus can be a turning point in the conflict: the universal condemnation of their use as a Only when the Treaty enters into force and is implemented will it make a real difference in saving lives, minimizing human suffering and lessening criminality and threats to civilian populations by providing the highest common standards for the trade in arms, ammunition and components. Once again, I should like to thank and congratulate the non-governmental organization community for its dedication and tireless efforts in favour of the ATT. They never lost their faith and pushed Governments hard to achieve that result. But our work is not yet done. Together we must continue to secure the 50 ratifications needed and ensure more to support for the ATT. We must also persuade those countries that abstained in the voting to support a regulated arms trade and the Treaty so as to make it universal.Finland, as one of the seven co-authors, has from the beginning been and will in future be very much involved with the Arms Trade Treaty. This week, the co-authors organized a high-level event to promote the signing of the Treaty. We are also prepared to assist countries that have difficulties in ratifying and implementing the Treaty. When implemented, the Treaty should also have a major impact on development, particularly in the least developed countries, where conflicts are a major obstacle to development.The success or failure of the United Nations ultimately depends upon us, the Member States. There is no alternative to the United Nations. Let us give it a chance. That is what our peoples expect from us."}}
