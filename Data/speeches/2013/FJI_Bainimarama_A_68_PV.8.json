{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, I wish to congratulate President Ashe on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and express my confidence that under his able and wise guidance, the Assembly will successfully accomplish its many tasks. I would also like to pay tribute to the tireless efforts of last years President, His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremic, and extend my appreciation for the effectiveness with which he directed the work of the Assembly at the previous session.Fiji reached a pivotal moment in its history earlier this month, when His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji promulgated the nations new Constitution. This Constitution introduces the first genuine democracy that Fiji will enjoy since we gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1970. Forty-three years and three Constitutions later, we finally have a Constitution that is worthy of the Fijian people. It is a Constitution that meets the test of a genuine democracy, that upholds the legal and moral basis of a common and equal citizenry without denying anyones individuality or culture. The 2013 Fijian Constitution enshrines principles that are at the heart of all the worlds great liberal democracies: an independent judiciary, a secular State and a wide range of civil, political and socioeconomic rights. It recognizes the indigenous peoples of Fiji and their customary practices, protects the rights of the predominantly indigenous landowners and those of their wealth accumulation and technological advances, the rift that divides the rich and the poor zones of the world ever widens. We must therefore not lose focus on one imperative of our time: equality among nations, big and small, is central to the relevance, credibility and even survival of this global Organization.In that regard, we are encouraged by the progress made thus far in the General Assembly towards expeditiously launching the follow-up mechanisms agreed at the Rio+20 Conference in 2012. Throughout the course of this year, the Group of 77 and China has emphasized that the road map towards a post-2015 development agenda needs to address the implementation gaps of the Millennium Development Goals, with poverty eradication remaining an overarching goal. The new development agenda must be universal, applicable and relevant to all Member States. Let me also stress that the new development agenda should be centred on economic development that supports both social inclusion and environmental sustainability.Our common desire for a transformative global development agenda beyond 2015 can best be achieved through collective efforts and an enhanced global partnership. Such efforts must place the development and well-being of people at its core. If the international community and national Governments seriously commit to an agenda for meaningful transformation at the structural, institutional and normative levels, the post-2015 development agenda has the potential of achieving a paradigm shift in global conditions.Fijis commitment to being a good global citizen is manifested through our ongoing engagement with the United Nations and its associated agencies and secretariats. Our decision to take on the mantle of chairing the Group of 77 and China for the year 2013 was informed by the fact that Fiji embraces its rights as an equal Member of the United Nations and that we must therefore also carry all the due responsibilities expected of us within this great family of nations.Fijis commitment to United Nations peacekeeping remains unwavering. It is a source of great pride that, for a nation of our size, we are able to make a meaningful and significant contribution. For the past three decades, we have always responded to the call of the United Nations to serve, including in the most difficult circumstances around the world. While we fully recognize the risks involved, Fijis confidence in close to 540,000 Fijians — out of an estimated 620,000 eligible voters — have registered for the 2014 election.Many modern, stable democracies have gone through their own turbulent periods. Some have gone through decades of instability and bloodshed, while others have had a single defining moment. Those events changed the course of history. They turned their countries from bastions of elitism and oppression into nations of freedom, equality and true democracy. The United States has its Bunker Hill and Civil War. France has the storming of the Bastille and the French revolution. Australia has the Eureka Stockade, and Britain has had a bloody history as it struggled to establish a constitutional monarchy. We Fijians have also had our share of turbulence.Regrettably and to our great disappointment, some of our oldest friends had no faith in us. They abandoned us and sought to punish us with sanctions. We sought their assistance and understanding, but they turned their backs on us. They chose to support a form of democracy, governance and justice in Fiji that they would never have accepted for themselves. We hope that they see now that we were true to our word. All nations struggle over time to overcome their unique challenges, to correct historic sins and to be worthy of the principles on which they were founded. We in Fiji are no different. Our isolation led us to seek out new relationships, which have proven fruitful. Now, our standing in the world has never been stronger. A key principle that has guided Fijis political development and foreign policy and is soundly grounded in the Charter of the United Nations is that we determine our own destinies as sovereign States. At the same time, we recognize the necessity of collaborating with all Member States of the United Nations with the aim of supporting sustainable world peace, substantive justice, dignity and respect for all. It is that spirit of collaboration that has inspired us to go beyond parochial interests and reach out to help others. That spirit enjoins us to be loyal to common ideals, goals, values and principles. They remain our guiding beacons as we navigate our way in this millennium.The theme set by the President to guide the general debate at this sixty-eighth session, which is “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage,” is most fitting for the juncture at which the United Nations stands. In the midst of increasing poverty and underdevelopment and during an era of unprecedented The United Nations efforts to eradicate colonialism must forge ahead within the context of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, of which Fiji is a member. Through the Pacific regional body known as the Melanesian Spearhead Group, Fiji works together with other members of the Fourth Committee to accelerate the process of decolonization.In reforming and developing its information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure, Fiji has adopted a comprehensive approach by combining a national framework for ICT development with effective and pragmatic policies and initiatives to deliver results directly to the Fijian people. That approach is bearing fruit. Fiji has achieved 95 per cebt mobile coverage, including 3G; concluded one of the regions first open auctions for the 4G spectrum; and is implementing a number of innovative initiatives to increase affordable access and improve services, including in the most remote parts of our country.The International Telecommunication Union, in its annual review of more than 150 countries delivery of ICT infrastructure and services to their populations, gave special recognition to Fiji as a developing country. Fiji tied for the third largest improvement of any country and is ranked fourth globally in percentage terms, having improved by 14 per cent.As the first country to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Fiji has kept its oceanic obligations at the core of its foreign policy. While some disconnect exists between what is contained in international instruments and what is or is not implemented, we need a commitment to clear steps to turn words into actions in order to facilitate the sustainable management of ocean resources and make equitable the share of benefits from their utilization.Fiji hosted the inaugural Pacific Islands Development Forum (PIDF) last month. Its formation makes the PIDF the only South-South organization in the Pacific region that provides for a multi-stakeholder platform where Governments, the private sector and civil society can discuss what we Pacific Islanders need to do to achieve sustainable development.We look forward to a productive sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Let me reiterate our full support and cooperation with President Ashe and all members with a view to advancing the objectives of the United Nations and the aspirations of the global community.its peacekeepers prompted us to provide troops to the Golan Heights this year to assist the United Nations in a time of need. The many years of service of Fijian troops in the Middle East region, particularly in Lebanon, Iraq and Sinai, are an asset that our troops take with them to that mission. Fiji also sees police peacekeeping and contributions in the corrections and justice sector as important in building local State institutions that can be run by local authorities once peacekeeping missions end, and we are building on our many existing commitments in that regard in Liberia, Darfur and South Sudan.It is up to us in the General Assembly to ensure that all support possible is given to troop- and police-contributing countries serving on the ground, including through clear and appropriate policy guidance. For the good of the countries concerned, we must not abdicate that responsibility. I urge us all to work together in the United Nations to provide such concrete policy guidance, particularly as we see peacekeeping missions evolve into multidimensional and complex missions that differ greatly from early United Nations peacekeeping missions.As a Pacific island nation, Fiji reaffirms its support for the efforts of small island developing States (SIDS) to achieve sustainable development. Not only are SIDS acutely vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such as sea-level rise, ocean acidification and the increased frequency of extreme weather events, but for some of us the threat is to our very existence. Our response to the plight of those most at risk must therefore be characterized by a requisite sense of urgency.The convening of the third International Conference for Sustainable Development of SIDS in 2014 will be critical to addressing, in a very specific and concrete manner, the many challenges faced by SIDS. It is an opportunity for the international community to renew its commitment to the implementation of the decisions and agreements pertaining to SIDS. As the international community discusses the post-2015 development landscape, including a successor to the Hyogo Framework for Action, we must ensure that a new model accounts for and addresses the risks we face. This is particularly relevant for SIDS, where hundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses occur as a result of so-called natural disasters every year. Protecting development gains and investing in disaster resilience is vital to sustainable development. this respect is indispensable and has been underscored time and again by the 28 Governments of the European Union. Following the Secretary-Generals report and the inventory of its arsenal provided by the Syrian regime, it is urgent for the Security Council, together with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, to take the necessary decisions to ensure the swift and secure destruction of Syrias stocks of poison gas and nerve agents. A clear resolution of the Security Council would mark a turn, and I plea for its adoption. Eliminating Syrias chemical arsenal is in itself a major step. Potentially, it could also be important for the wider dynamics in the region. Clearly, the conflict wrecking Syria reflects many of the deep-seated tensions rippling throughout the Middle East. It is fed by these tensions and fuels them as well. So a solution for Syria will need to take the wider picture into account. That is why any political opening matters deeply; a breakthrough on chemical weapons could start opening other doors. In the black wall of Syrias doom, it will be a first crack.Paradoxically, there is more scope for quiet hope today than there was even a few weeks ago. Because if commitments can be upheld and promises kept on chemical weapons, if lines of communication can reopen, if we can find an agreement within the international community and at the Security Council — if we can do all this on chemical weapons, then chances are we can do it elsewhere. There must be ways to open up opportunities. But when new opportunities arise, we must seize them. Only then will we see the outlook improve for Syria. Now is indeed the moment to work actively towards the “Geneva II” conference. The international community must fully engage with all available diplomatic means. The first priority is to bring all parties to the negotiating table. Those close to Damascus and those close to the Syrian opposition must do all within their power to draw each side to the table. The European Union is ready to provide all support needed to achieve a political settlement. Elsewhere in the region too, new opportunities must and can be seized, not least in the Middle East peace process, where prospects for progress look better than they have for some time. All parties are returning to the negotiating table with renewed seriousness. For the European Union, the parameters are clear. Palestine and "}}
