{"speech":{"0":" I am pleased to join previous speakers in congratulating the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I thank our outgoing President for his excellent leadership. Allow me also to extend my respect and gratitude to the Secretary-General for his untiring commitment to the mission and ideals of the United Nations.Since the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the international community has supported the principle that the best form of development is one that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Since that time, however, production and consumption patterns have become increasingly unsustainable, driven primarily by a desire to develop economies at any cost. The Federated States of Micronesia has therefore proposed the following approach to global development beyond 2015. First, any post-2015 development agenda must move beyond addressing basic human needs and focus on sustainable development. Secondly, in order to ensure that sustainable development is carried out in a dynamic and inclusive manner, the post-2015 development agenda must honour the environmental, economic and social pillars that make up sustainable development. Finally, international cooperation and assistance are crucial to fostering sustainable development globally. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have posed significant challenges. We continue to look to the international community for We did many good things, but like any leader — and when I became President, I was then the youngest president in the world — I realize that some things were done at a very high cost because of lack of experience. In our rush to impose a new reality against the background of internal and external threats, we cut corners and certainly made mistakes. At times we went too far and at other times not far enough. I fully acknowledge my responsibility in that regard, and I sincerely feel for all those who believe that they did not benefit enough from our work, or even that they were victims of our radical methods.I want to tell all Georgian citizens — those who supported our project, our policies and our party and those who rejected them — how proud I am of their maturity. We promised them this project, but we did not promise them that it would be smooth going. We were very ambitious, and that was because our people were so mature and so brave. I want to tell them from this rostrum how humble I feel in the light of the sacrifices and the efforts they made.We are and should remain a nation united in a common love for freedom and dignity. We are and should remain a nation united in the deepest respect for the sacrifices made by our soldiers, a nation sharing the same sorrow when they lose their lives - in Afghanistan, for instance - and taking the same pride in their bravery. We are a nation that is proud of our soldiers, who stood up to a force of Russian invaders one hundred times the size of our contingent, and gave us and the world time to mobilize and to protect and save our independence — something that, with all due respect, many much bigger and more powerful nations could not do in the twentieth century. We are and we should remain a nation united in our historical identity and our desire to join the European family of democratic nations, the family we should never have been separated from in the first place, our family. The path of the Georgian people towards freedom, regional unity and European integration is far from over, and I will continue to dedicate every day of my life to its success, as a proud citizen of a proud nation."}}
