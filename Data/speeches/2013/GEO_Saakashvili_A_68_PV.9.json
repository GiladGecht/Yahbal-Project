{"speech":{"0":" It is a great honour to once again represent my beloved nation at this rostrum. During the past decade, when I have had the privilege to address the Hall, Georgia has moved from a failed State to a market democracy. We have experienced both advances and setbacks, both breakthroughs and mistakes. But the world has been able to witness my nations constant commitment to freedom. I ask members today once again to hear the voice of a nation that transcends political, social and religious differences in a common love for freedom — a voice that, despite all the problems we have encountered and the challenges we still have to overcome, is full of hope. Looking at our world today, I think that this voice of hope is needed.The optimism of the early 1990s, when the spread of liberal and democratic values seemed natural, when the end of history had been proclaimed, and when the United Nations was set to become the heart and the soul of a world finally at peace, the optimism of that era — noticeable when I was a student in New York and visited the United Nations as an intern — was then crushed by a wave of pessimism and cynicism.The world is not at peace. Humankind has not reconciled with itself, and the United Nations did not become the heart and soul of a united globe. Western civilization, once triumphant, is now trying to tackle a deep economic, social, and spiritual crisis. In Eastern Europe the colour revolutions are challenged by the very forces they defeated a few years ago. In the Middle East the glorious images of cheering crowds in Cairo and Tunis have been replaced by the horrendous videos of the gassed children of Damascus.There are many good reasons to be disillusioned. But should the untrammelled optimism of the 1990s be replaced by an equally untrammelled pessimism, by a sense of resignation that stif les hope? Should the fact that the expansion of democracy and freedom turns out to require profound struggle cause us to renounce our beliefs and our principles?The creation of jobs, sustainable livelihoods and equitable growth is critical for the development of any country and is linked to the goal of ending poverty. Emphasis should be put on value addition, technology transfer and the development of entrepreneurial skills, particularly for young people. As a country, Swaziland is fully behind the post-2015 agenda, because it remains a guideline for the international community in working together for the sustainable development of our respective countries.The issue of the reform of the Security Council remains a top priority for the African continent. We are calling for a Council that will give equal opportunities to all regions of the world to voice their opinions as an international family on issues regarding global conflict. We believe our proposal is just and fair so that as a region Africa can have a voice in the affairs of the Council as equal partners in this global Organization.The United Nations should continue to play its advocacy role to ensure humankind continues to live peacefully with each other. All nations around the world should be given equal opportunities to share their expertise and experiences with the Organization.The Kingdom of eSwatini is happy to note that, with solid international support and cross-Strait developments, the Republic of China on Taiwan has increased its meaningful participation in United Nations specialized agencies and mechanisms. We will continue to encourage positive interaction in the international arena between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Finally, I hope that this session will come up with the desired results and tangible targets. We also look forward to a post-2015 agenda that will create a conducive landscape for all humankind to live in."}}
