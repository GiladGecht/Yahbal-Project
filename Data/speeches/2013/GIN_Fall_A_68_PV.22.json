{"speech":{"0":" It is with legitimate pride that I address the General Assembly, a symbol of the resolve of peoples to pool their potential in order to forge a better world where peace, security, prosperity and solidarity will allow humankind to face the many challenges before it.My pride is as great as my country, since we as a nation have just reached an important stage in our history by finalizing the transitional process and holding legislative elections on 28 September. Guinea has thus joined the melting pot of democratic nations that respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. It was able to do so thanks to the assistance of its partners whose action catalysed a fruitful dialogue among the actors of Guinean political life. The elections have certainly opened the path to widespread development blazed by the Government so that the Guinean population can finally take advantage of its rich potential. I cannot fail to raise the issue of Western Sahara, where we call on all stakeholders to spare no effort to arrive at a political solution. Our solidarity with Cuba is as strong as ever as we seek to have the embargo unjustly imposed on its people lifted.I should like to weigh in on a subject of major concern that is the focus of the international communitys attention — the Palestinian question. In spite of the many injunctions of the international community, the Palestinian people continue to suffer. Arbitrary violence, settlements and the seizure of goods continue to be the peoples daily lot. Guinea reiterates its unceasing support for the Palestinian cause, in the belief that peace and stability in the Middle East require the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the road map of the Quartet, which foresees the creation of an independent, sovereign and viable Palestinian State living side by side and in peace with Israel within safe and internationally recognized borders. We express the hope that the negotiations under way will enable the Palestinian people to finally enjoy their inalienable rights.Ever since its creation, the United Nations has spared no effort to promote peace, security and international cooperation in order to ensure the harmonious development of humankind. In this context, the Millennium Development Goals were a source of real hope for developing countries. The undeniable progress made in many areas — growth, education, gender equality, and maternal and child health — has largely contributed to pushing back the borders of poverty. Nevertheless, many important challenges have still to be met.At a time when the international community is investing in the creation of a post-2015 development agenda, we must recognize that the results achieved by the Millennium Development Goals have not lived up to our hopes. The eradication of extreme poverty depends on the strengthening of the human development base and the promotion of a competitive economy that respects the environment, which is an engine of inclusive growth and decent work. It also depends on governance that is favourable to sustainable development in the context of peace and security.In this quest, the focus must be on the monitoring, transparency and management of our natural resources. We must join in international partnership on the basis of reaffirmed solidarity and shared responsibility. That commitment to the stabilization of the subregion. The Guinean Government reiterates its determination to work for the re-establishment of constitutional order in Guinea-Bissau on the basis of the recommendations of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Union, the International Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau, the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, the European Union and the United Nations.The Mano River Union is an essential link for the consolidation of peace in West Africa and deserves our full attention. The international community, and in particular the United Nations and ECOWAS, must work to support that organization in its global approach to meeting the security and socioeconomic challenges.We welcome the determination of the Peacebuilding Commission to assist Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea in their efforts in security and defence sector reform, while promoting youth employment and the empowerment of women on the basis of national reconciliation.With respect to the Great Lakes region, we urge the parties to renounce violence and to firmly commit to bringing peace to the region via adherence to the Framework Agreement of 24 February. We thank the Mediator, President Denis Sassou Nguesso, for his efforts to re-establish sustainable peace in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and the Great Lakes region.As for the Central African Republic, urgent measures are needed to prevent a collapse of the State and to avert the chronic instability that threatens the country. We urge the Sudan and South Sudan to pursue dialogue in order to solve pending questions, specifically the status of Abyei province, and to relaunch bilateral cooperation.Given the deteriotation of the situation in Syria, the international community must strive further to bring an end to the relentless violence and massive destruction of lives and property. Guinea condemns the use of chemical weapons, which violates international norms and human dignity. Robust action must be undertaken for the destruction of the chemical arsenal in Syria, in accordance with the Russian-American initiative and Security Council resolution 2118 (2013). At the same time, the legal framework prohibiting the manufacture, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons must be strengthened. fear, illness or the spectre of ignorance. Our duty is to leave to future generations an environment conducive to sustainable development. Together we will save humanity."}}
