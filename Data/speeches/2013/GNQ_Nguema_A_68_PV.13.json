{"speech":{"0":" We bring to this sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly the fraternal and friendly greetings of the people of Equatorial Guinea. We also bring our fervent desire for peace and prosperity for all countries in the world at this difficult time, when the international community has to deal with major challenges that are thwarting the aspirations of the peoples for well-being and happiness.May I also extend my congratulations to Mr. John William Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda on his election to preside over the work of the General Assembly at this session. We wish him all the very best and every success in his difficult task, and we assure him of our support and cooperation. We would also like to thank his predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremic, for the excellent work he carried out and the dynamic style with which he presided over the work of the Assembly at its previous session.This sixty-eighth session is beginning its work on a tragic note, namely, the criminal and barbaric attack against innocent people in Kenya. It was an attack on a supermarket, a mall, which is a peaceful gathering place for people, which reflects the criminality of the perpetrators. Equatorial Guinea strongly condemns the heinous attack against the freedom and dignity of the Kenyan people, which also retards its national United Nations, our regional resources and bilateral partners. The statements of sympathy in the plenary are all too often not translated into effective, island-tailored results. Our in-country United Nations presence still has a long way to go in truly delivering as one and better addressing pressing threats. I encourage a direct discussion between the United Nations and our region on practical efforts to enhance in-country effectiveness and collaboration. No one people or nation should be passed over.Even as the United Nations enters into a new discussion in setting the stage for the post-2015 development agenda, improved progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) remains no less a priority. I would also like to recognize the contributions that Taiwan has made in helping my country in efforts to achieve the MDGs.Pacific Islands Forum leaders have, for the first time, recognized the role of the United Nations in authorizing nuclear-weapon testing during the Cold War and welcomed the recommendations of the United Nations Special Rapporteurs recent report (HRAdd.1). Nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands is no mere historical event, but an international legacy that will stay with us for generations. While the bulk of the unmet responsibilities still rest with our historical Administering Power, the United States, the United Nations can, for its part, no longer ignore its own role during the Trusteeship era. I am strongly encouraged by the Secretary-Generals commitment to addressing the ongoing impacts of nuclear testing in the Pacific and look forward to practical steps in that regard.My Government is gratified to note that — with solid international support and cross-strait cooperation — the Republic of China on Taiwan has increased its meaningful participation in United Nations specialized agencies and mechanisms. We will continue to encourage positive interaction between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in the international arena.Too often, despite our own aspirations, we struggle to move inches when urgency demands miles. We wish to inform the Secretary-General that our political will stands ready and that our hands are extended for a durable partnership."}}
