{"speech":{"0":" I congratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I convey my deep gratitude and appreciation to the Secretary-General for his work to strengthen the role and effectiveness of the United Nations, fully supporting the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.I take this opportunity to emphasize my countrys alignment with the positions of the European Union, presented by the President of the European Council, Mr. Herman Van Rompuy, in his address (see ).Greece remains fully committed to the objectives of the United Nations, whose universal ideals have never ceased to inspire us. We are deeply committed to our collective work for sustainable peace, prosperity and safeguarding human dignity. In that spirit, we lend our full support to the efforts to reform and strengthen the Organization in order to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.We welcome the special event on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the High-Level Political Forum that took place this week and highlighted the broad themes of international development and cooperation. The effective management of migration can have a positive impact on the countries of origin and of destination. The High-Level Dialogue on International Migration and Development to be held on 3 and 4 October presents an important opportunity to develop a global agenda for the effective and inclusive management of migration and to reaffirm the necessary political will. Greece is committed to participating actively in joint efforts to that end.violence on development. The crisis situations and threats that I have just mentioned illustrate this clearly. We must also speak firmly about governance that is conducive to development, institutions that guarantee the rule of law, freedom of expression, and transparent and accountable Governments. We must talk about justice, the fight against impunity and respect for international law.Luxembourg fully subscribes to the Secretary-Generals call for the post-2015 objectives to be based on the international norms and principles of human rights. Those objectives must apply to everybody and help address the global challenges of the twenty-first century, building on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). They must contribute to eliminating poverty and promoting sustainable development, and be integrated into one coherent framework. The special event held the day before yesterday by the General Assembly allowed us to take stock of ongoing work towards achieving the MDGs and to welcome significant progress made, but also to identify the sectors where it will be important to redouble our efforts. As the Secretary-General has reminded us, the picture before us is only half finished. We must therefore speed up the march towards attaining the MDGs. We must renew our commitment. We must keep our promises.My country will continue to do its part. Since 2009, our official development assistance has amounted to 1 per cent of our gross national income. We are determined to maintain this effort despite the crisis. At the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in June 2012, we reaffirmed our commitment to sustainable development in its three interdependent dimensions: economic development, social inclusion and environmental sustainability. We reiterated our determination to address the threats that climate change and environmental degradation pose to humankind. With its European partners, Luxembourg has made binding commitments to reduce its carbon emissions and to mitigate the effects of climate change. We are resolved to do our all to achieve a universal climate agreement in 2015.Last year in the Hall of the General Assembly, our Head of State, the Grand Duke, underscored Luxembourgs willingness to serve the United Nations (see ). Today, I take this opportunity to thank the Assembly for having elected my country to a two- of Syrias chemical arsenal. We welcome the diplomatic breakthrough expected to be achieved by the Security Council on the destruction of Syrias chemical weapons. It is our fervent hope that it will be a crucial turning point in the Syrian crisis, providing vital momentum towards a “Geneva II”-type process that can take us to a viable and inclusive political resolution of the Syrian crisis.Greece has always been a firm supporter of a European future for the Balkan region. The process of European integration means leaving behind old, divisive mentalities and moving towards an era of close cooperation, on the basis of shared values and principles. Demonstrating political courage, Belgrade and Pristina concluded an historic agreement in April, which is a major development towards consolidating peace and stability in the Western Balkans and advancing the European integration of both sides.We seek to develop our relations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on the basis of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and within the framework of good neighbourly relations. Greece is committed to the ongoing United Nations-led negotiation process and to finding a solution on the issue of a name. We therefore continue our efforts to reach a mutually acceptable name for all uses, erga omnes, that will leave no grey areas and allow for a clear distinction between our neighbouring country and the region of Macedonia in northern Greece. The solution of the name issue will enable both Greece and its neighbour to develop multidimensional and productive cooperation at the bilateral and regional levels. It will also contribute to the stability and prosperity of South-East Europe and boost the countrys Euro-Atlantic aspirations.Thirty-nine years after the Turkish military invasion of the island, the Cyprus problem remains first and foremost an issue of illegal military occupation of well over one third of the territory of a Member State of the United Nations and European Union. A comprehensive agreed settlement of that major international problem is a top priority for the foreign policy of Greece. In that context, Greece greatly values the Secretary-Generals mission of good offices, in particular his ongoing efforts to successfully relaunch the intercommunal negotiating process. We also fully support President Anastasiadis renewed constructive package proposal.We hope that Ankara will decide at long last to pursue a new policy of normalization of its relations Greece and the other countries of southern Europe are under great pressure with regard to the issue of illegal immigration, which weighs heavily on our financial and administrative capacities. The effective management of migration represents for our country a key political option in that it relates directly to safeguarding and respecting human rights, social cohesion and public security, and to maintaining the economic stability of our countries. On the basis of our experience of recent years, we have reviewed our national action plan to reform the system of asylum and immigration. Furthermore, migration and mobility issues will be among the priorities of the Greek presidency of the European Council in the first term of 2014.The promotion of human rights is a priority interest. Greece will lend its full support to strengthening the Human Rights Council with a solid mandate. Greece is determined to contribute actively to the mission of the Human Rights Council and is presenting its candidature for the 2017–2019 term. Greece is strongly devoted to the decisive role of the United Nations in peace and security. In spite of financial restraints, we remain firmly committed to peacekeeping operations, to which we contribute personnel and resources, including to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. We support efforts to prevent conflicts and promote the peaceful settlement of disputes. Moreover, we attach particular importance to cooperation between the European Union and the United Nations in the field of crisis management, and we welcome the work undertaken to further strengthen that cooperation.(spoke in English) The relaunching of peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, facilitated by the United States, provides an important opportunity to reach a final settlement to this long-standing problem, to the benefit and stability in the wider region, based on a two-State solution with a secure Israel and a sovereign, contiguous and viable Palestine living side by side. Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas must be praised for their leadership and courage to engage in the peace talks. Now is the time to take bold and concrete steps towards peace.Greece is very concerned with the ongoing crisis in Syria, which jeopardizes stability in a very fragile region. Greece and the European Union have unequivocally condemned the use of chemical weapons, and we strongly support the United States-Russian Federation initiative for the collection and destruction necessary structural reforms in public administration, the investment sector and the labour market, and our privatization programme is already yielding results. But all of that has, of course, come through great sacrifices borne by the Greek people and at a very high social and political cost. Defending democracy and the rule of law against forms of racist, xenophobic conduct and all forms of social violence is a fundamental engagement of the Hellenic Republic.I also wish to say a few words about the priorities of Greeces upcoming presidency of the Council of the European Union in the first half of 2014. Coming at a time of unprecedented economic challenges for the Union, our presidency will carry forward the vital debate on the future of Europe — a debate that will intensify as we approach next years European elections.All the issues that humankind is facing and that are being dealt with by General Assembly at this session highlight the need to enhance the role of the United Nations and to further consolidate the institutions of global economic and political governance. The hopes of the international community are oriented towards the United Nations. Our Organization has to send a strong and clear message of peace, security and prosperity to the peoples of the world, particularly the younger generation"}}
