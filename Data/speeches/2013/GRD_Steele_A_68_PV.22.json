{"speech":{"0":" I wish to extend my sincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. The fact that you were elected by consensus speaks in unequivocal terms of the high esteem in which you are held by your colleagues and the respect that you command in this forum. I am confident that your vast practical experience at the multilateral level will serve you in good stead as you guide this session to a fruitful outcome. In the same breath, I pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremic, for his astute stewardship at the previous session. development as the organizing theme for the development of our island and for our engagement with international partners. Grenada is a party to more than 40 multilateral environmental agreements. The push to harmonize local laws with those international instruments is testament to Grenadas commitment to that agenda. The reasons are clear, the causes of climate change and the impacts of climate change are negatively affecting Grenadas ability to fulfil its social contract with its people, including its ability to fully deliver on the Millennium Development Goals.So far I have spoken only about economic sustainability and environmental sustainability. The third pillar of sustainable development relates to social sustainability. Grenada is a society in which social development is given equal weighting with the importance of investment and economic growth driven by the private sector. On 13 May, a mere three months after assuming office, my Government ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. We are proceeding apace to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, thus demonstrating that Grenada is committed to the removal of all forms of discrimination.Grenada associates itself with efforts to dedicate the Caribbean region to the development of humanity. We also acknowledge that through the ages the Arab world has contributed enormously to the world of science and mathematics, including the very numerals we use today. We see a modern Arab world taking positive steps to take the lead in developing breakthroughs on the key issues that confront our planet. We very much welcome initiatives such as Masdar City and the hosting of the International Renewable Energy Agency by the United Arab Emirates. The role of Qatar in hosting the United Nations Climate Change Conference is also noteworthy. Grenada joins with other countries in seeking to deepen our relationship with the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council and places a high degree of importance on the peace and security of the region.We are mindful that the region and the entire United Nations system have been seized of the issues of peace and security during United Nations Week. Grenada and many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are home to a vibrant and entrepreneurial diaspora from the Middle East, including people from Syria and Lebanon. As a consequence, Grenadian citizens are very concerned about the prospects for peace in Syria and the wider Middle East.United States economy, the costs ran between 0.5 per cent and 2 per cent of the gross domestic product of the United States. That is in sharp contrast to the costs of between 20 per cent and 200 per cent of gross domestic product when hurricanes hit island economies.Therefore, Grenada is joining with other SIDS in urging the shareholders, the donors and the boards of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to translate the recognition of climate vulnerability in small island States into a meaningful package of financial and official development assistance for SIDS.The issue of the graduation of SIDS is an issue that has been raised year after year. Let us return to the General Assembly next year confident that progress on that matter has been made. In that regard, we wish to suggest for consideration during your presidency, Sir, a call for a substantive paper and a debate on the issue. Ideally, the outcomes of that debate should be provided as an input towards the 2014 third International Conference on Small Island Developing States, to be hosted by Samoa, and as an input to the Secretary-Generals debate on climate change scheduled for September 2014.Also contributing to the indebtedness and fiscal unsustainability of small island States are the volatility and high prices for fossil fuels. On average, small island developing States are paying between 20 cents and 40 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity, some as high as $1. That contrasts with prices of 5 cents to 15 cents in developed countries. We welcome, therefore, the initiative of the Alliance of Small Island States in establishing the SIDS DOCK Support Programme. We also wish to express gratitude to the donors and institutions for helping to facilitate that programme.In addition, the Government of Grenada is taking major steps towards creating a green economy. One of the priorities for Grenadas Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Keith Mitchell, is the dismantling of a monopoly that is contributing to high energy costs on the island of Grenada. The Government is seeking partners to help create a level playing field, which will allow many more private-sector players to have a role in innovative and substantive power-generation solutions, while positioning Grenada as an exemplar for a sustainable planet.Mr. President, as you have chosen the theme of sustainability for the sixty-eighth session, so too has the Government of Grenada chosen sustainable Finally, my delegation uses this occasion once more to express our solidarity with the Cuban people, who continue to suffer from an unnecessary economic, commercial and financial embargo that is a relic of the Cold War. Grenada once again calls on the United States of America to respect the views of the overwhelming majority of humanity and lift the onerous measures imposed over five decades ago now.We support your theme, Mr. President, for this sixty-eighth session and wish to assure our partners that they can count on Grenada to be an active participant in these deliberations and in the implementation of their outcomes.Grenada is open for business. My Government recognizes that a tried-and-tested route to sustainable development involves a significant component of foreign direct investment. Grenada therefore reaches out and seeks new friendships while maintaining and building upon its existing and long-standing relations with many States members of this body.In 2014 Grenada marks its fortieth anniversary of independence, and we invite each and every Member to celebrate with us on 7 February. We also see our 40 years as a milestone that recognizes 40 years of struggle, 40 years of development. But also, more importantly, it marks 40 years of expectations not yet fully delivered upon. As such, my Government, under the leadership of our Prime Minister, sees this year as the year of less talk and more action, the year of tangible deliverables, and the year that great socioeconomic strides are made. We have a young and vibrant population that cannot wait any longer, that should not wait any longer, and with the help and cooperation of our friends, new and old, we will deliver. They will not wait any longer."}}
