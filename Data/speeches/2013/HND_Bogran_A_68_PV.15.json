{"speech":{"0":" The Government of Honduras extends its warmest congratulations to Mr. Ashe on his election to preside over the proceedings of the General Assembly, and we wish him every success.I am grateful for the honour that the President of Honduras conferred upon me by asking me to represent him in this world forum. As we come to the close of our term in office, we in the Administration of President Porfirio Lobo Sosa note with satisfaction that we have laid the foundation for national unity and reconciliation. We have successfully overcome the severe political crisis that affected Honduras during the previous Government, and Honduras now looks forward to new general elections in November.The Government of President Lobo Sosa has normalized relations with the international community. We have secured ties of close cooperation with more than a hundred friendly countries, restored foreign credit and shown the world that we are a country that lives up to its democratic and peaceful calling. Today, Honduras is a member of the principal international and regional organizations. Our membership in major forums has given us access to new markets, opportunities for investment and employment and helped to strengthen our energy sector.As part of the process of unity and reconciliation, the President of the Republic created a Government of National Integration, with the participation of all the political parties that took part in the last electoral process. Fortunately, that participation continues today and will continue through the end of the present constitutional term. Accordingly, I wish to mention that, as part of the process of healing the wounds of the 2009 political crisis and building the future together, we have successfully adopted by consensus a long-term country vision and a national plan from which our Government programme is derived. That shared vision is being implemented through a major national agreement for economic growth with social equity between the Government of President Lobo Sosa, trade unions, business owners, workers, farmers and civil society. I believe that Honduras and the world should welcome those efforts, together with the spirit of dialogue and commitment of all sectors of Honduran society, which have shown that collective interests come well before individual interests.Despite progress made in the past decade and the fact that the Angolan economy is on the right path, much remains to be done in order to fulfil the Millennium Development Goals. Aware of that challenge, the Government continues to develop programmes aimed at reducing social inequality, while pursuing the fight against hunger and poverty as two crucial elements for building a prosperous society and attaining social justice. Furthermore, rehabilitating and upgrading the main productive and social infrastructure, including the reconstruction of roads and railways, electricity and water supply and distribution systems, and sanitation and telecommunication networks, continue to be a challenge for the Government in its quest to improve the well-being of the population and attain sustainable development in Angola.I would like to conclude by referring to an issue of particular importance for the Government of my country. The Republic of Angola is a candidate for non-permanent-member status in the Security Council, with elections to be held at the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We hope we can count on the support of all the States that make up the Assembly.I will finish by expressing my countrys unconditional support for the initiatives of the United Nations aimed at building a better world for all, based on justice and freedom, free from all threats that endanger international peace and security."}}
