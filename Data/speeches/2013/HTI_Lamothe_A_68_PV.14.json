{"speech":{"0":" I would first like to express my warm and fraternal gratitude to the President of the Republic of Haiti, His Excellency Mr. Michel Joseph Martelly, for the trust he has placed in me and, above all, for his courage and unwavering determination to build a new Haiti. I would also like to congratulate Mr. John Ashe, Permanent Representative of Antigua and Barbuda, for his election to the While I am speaking of continuing our efforts and making them lasting, I would like to mention the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. It is absolutely vital that we seize the opportunity afforded by our American friends. A solution must be arrived at now, based on the coexistence of two States, with the State of Israel and an independent State of Palestine living side by side in peace and security. We have also made it very clear that we are against colonization. In that context, Belgium is ready to host a conference in Brussels aimed at ensuring that private economic partners provide support for the peace process. We believe that there can be no economic plan, however, unless there is a political plan with a concrete timetable.Peace and security also depend on harmonious prosperity, whose benefits must be shared equitably around the globe and among its citizens. According to scientists, the worlds ecological footprint now exceeds the worlds capacity for regeneration by about 50 per cent. That situation is untenable and affects everything on the planet. I welcome the United Nations initiative to convene Heads of State and Government here in New York for a forum on sustainable development. It is here that less developed and developed countries can solve the huge challenge of sustainable development together. Every country has problems that are either shared or complementary and interconnected. By that I mean extreme poverty, desertification, the exodus for ecological reasons of millions of people, the exhaustion of natural resources and climatic warming.Despite the progress that has been made, much remains to be done to meet the Millennium Development Goals. Hunger, poverty and unequal access to education and health care are intolerable injustices. We must continue to mobilize to fight them. That is why Belgium asks that the efforts made under the rubric of post-2015 development be merged with the goals of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in a single negotiation framework within the United Nations. That single framework should bring together the economic, social and environmental aspects that are becoming facts of life for all of us.I would like to touch on one final subject, that is, espionage and cybercrime. Our colleague President Dilma Rousseff asked a true question for today (see ). Is it permissible to ignore privacy laws in the name of security and the fight against terrorism, and policies that are focused on a strategic long-term development plan.The aims underlying our Governments action go hand in hand with the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. However, the development under way cannot take place without a deep-seated reform of the public administration and good political governance. That is why the rule of law is one of our priorities. In that regard, we have made great strides in 28 months. A Supreme Council of the Judiciary has been put in place to ensure the independence of judges and of all the justices appointed to the Court of Cassation. The professionalism of the Haitian National Police enables us today to provide and guarantee security and to create a climate conducive to investment, which is necessary to combat extreme poverty. The performance of our police force has meant that Haiti is now ranked as one of the safest countries in the Caribbean. Next year will mark the tenth anniversary of the military and police presence of the United Nations in Haiti. The Haitian Government welcomes the implementation of the plan for the gradual withdrawal of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, which is now possible thanks to the considerable progress achieved in the area of security.The implementation of the constitutional mechanisms envisaged in the context of the rule of law is an ongoing priority for the Government. We have managed to create a climate conducive to political stability and to the expression of ideas and democratic values. The Haitian press enjoys full freedom, and members of the political opposition exercise their rights without restrictions. I would also like to mention the commitment and work of the Government in consolidating the rule of law and ensuring the sustainability of democratic institutions. To that end, the Government continues to give its full support to the transitional college of the Permanent Electoral Council to ensure that legislative and local elections take place as soon as possible. Despite its lack of resources, the Haitian Government has already allocated significant funds to the electoral body. The President of the Republic of Haiti is personally involved in initiating a dialogue with stakeholders and political parties and is encouraging them to participate in the upcoming elections in order to respect the process of democratic change, as it is essential to the rule of law.presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session, as well as to salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.I am proud to speak in this forum of modern global history, one that has witnessed so many great leaders discussing their vision for a world that is more just and a humankind that is more enlightened and balanced.It has been 13 years since the States Members of the Organization, buoyed by the basic values of freedom and equality, met to launch a new world order for development when they adopted the Millennium Declaration (resolution ). It has been a strong period for the United Nations, which continues to stand out through its efforts to call on the peoples of the world to unite to overcome the challenges linked to poverty and social exclusion.I speak on behalf of Haiti when I voice our pleasure at the increasing vitality of the Organization, which over the years has succeeded in preserving the ideals of peace and solidarity. My country has always sought, with the United Nations, to provide a better future to generations to come. We have done so enthusiastically, because over the past two centuries, Haiti — the land of Toussaint Louverture, Alexandre Petion, Jean-Jacques Dessalines and Henri Christophe — has never missed the great historic events. It is up to all of us to preserve this vital tool for the future of humankind.The theme of the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly is “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. This is the ideal opportunity for Haiti to present to the entire world an initial assessment of the work carried out by the Government, work which largely meets the aims of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and which allows us to see a burgeoning new Haiti.Before presenting those achievements to the Assembly, it is important to recall the situation that Haiti found itself in when President Michel Martelly was sworn in. In January 2010, Haiti was in a particularly critical situation, especially because of the devastating, large-scale earthquake. The natural disasters following the earthquake exacerbated the already very difficult problems. Despite daily difficulties, Haiti is now resolutely and definitively on the path of progress. Our country is gradually recovering from the natural disasters it experienced and today is facing the future with confidence. We have adopted effective measures In the twenty-first century, people are still starving in Haiti. That is unacceptable and intolerable. As Nelson Mandela said, “overcoming poverty is not a gesture of charity, it is an act of justice.” For President Martelly and myself, combatting extreme poverty is a commitment that we make to history.In terms of health care, there are considerable challenges to be met in Haiti. The prevalence of certain diseases, the high rates of infant mortality and the shortcomings in health-care infrastructure have deprived millions of Haitians of good-quality health services. That situation was exacerbated by the earthquake in 2010. Furthermore, in October 2010, there was a very serious outbreak of cholera in Haiti, for which the Haitian people continue to pay a heavy price in human lives. Given the catastrophic consequences of that scourge — more than 8,000 dead and 650,000 people infected — the Haitian Government is proposing that a significant amount of the new global fund to combat cholera be earmarked exclusively for the eradication of the disease in Haiti. While we continue to believe that the United Nations has some moral responsibility with regard to the outbreak of the epidemic, it is nonetheless true that the Organization has already supported some of the Governments efforts to combat the disease. However, those efforts are far from enough. We would therefore like to propose the establishment of a joint commission, including members of the Haitian Government and representatives of the United Nations, to consider ways and means to definitively eradicate the disease in Haiti.In the face of those major public health challenges, the Haitian Government has not stood idly by. Working with our national and international partners and public health experts, we have managed to curb the spread of HIAIDS. In terms of treating AIDS today, Haiti has moved from a prevalence rate of 5.5 in 2000 to 2.2 today, with a projected 1.5 for 2015. Such results are a just reward for the years of effort that have made Haiti a model universally recognized in international scientific and academic circles. But we will not stop there. Much remains to be done in terms of prevention and treatment. We very much hope that we can definitively halt the spread of AIDS and make treatment more affordable. In Haiti, the public health network and the provision of health care are largely insufficient. New efforts in terms of prevention must be made.With regard to education, more than 1.2 million Haitian children have benefited from the free education programme put in place by the Government. We have achieved that in particular by establishing a universal, free and compulsory education programme. That is a major achievement for Haiti, and one that is in keeping with one of the most important Millennium Development Goals: the achievement of universal primary education by 2015. The Government is aware that this achievement does not resolve the challenge of providing access to quality schooling for everyone. That is a new objective that we are determined to achieve. Moreover, an ambitious programme to combat illiteracy is under way. It will impact more than 250,000 people in 2014.With regard to combating hunger and extreme poverty — another Millennium Development Goal — despite the serious social inequality in Haiti, the Government has made considerable efforts to avoid a humanitarian crisis. To achieve its goals in the fight against extreme poverty, the Government has invested more than $150 million in social assistance and protection programmes, which is a first for our country. The programmes are aimed at helping the most vulnerable. Since 2012, three ministries have been established to strengthen public policies for the elimination of extreme poverty. The Government is pursuing a national food-security policy that includes a series of 15 measures that are expected to yield results in the short, medium and long terms. In the short term, the objective is, first, to stabilize the price of basic consumer goods and, secondly, to provide assistance to those living in extreme poverty. In the medium and long terms, the objective is to increase national production and to reduce our food dependence. We have also introduced a social innovation that is unprecedented in the history of our country by initiating a series of social programmes for the most vulnerable groups under the theme “Help the poor”. After one year of operation, those programmes are now reaching more than 1 million Haitian people living in extreme poverty: thousands of mothers, students, older persons, disabled people and victims of natural disasters. Finally, along the same lines, I would like it to be noted that of the 1.5 million earthquake refugees who were living in tents in subhuman conditions, more than 1.25 million have now been rehoused. A new Haiti is emerging. More than ever before, Haiti feels that it is taking its place in the great family of the United Nations and in the international community, without which many of the achievements of the past three years would not have been possible.We are doing a great deal with very little. If the international community had fully met its commitments — amounting to $10 billion — made at the 31 March 2010 meeting, the results would be even better, and the suffering of the Haitian people would be less harsh. Today, we are still far from our goal, because only a part of those commitments have been honoured.Based on its desire for transparency and efficiency and to avoid duplication of effort on the part of non-governmental organizations, the Government has stepped up its leadership role and set up a mechanism — the National Coordination Framework for External Development Aid in Haiti — to take over the management of international assistance.Haiti is once again present on the regional scene. This year alone our country has hosted three major regional summits, including those of CARICOM, the Ministers of the Association of Caribbean States, and Petrocaribe. During those meetings, there were also discussions on the best regional strategies to combat hunger, abject poverty and exclusion, topics that are in line with the Millennium Development Goals. Finally, the Haiti of which I speak is the one that Haitian men and women are working tirelessly to forge each and every day. The results are coming; progress is already palpable. Our country is no longer on the front pages of the international press owing to repeated coups detat, social turmoil, insecurity and instability. Our country is henceforth stable and secure, thanks in particular to the tremendous efforts of the Haitian National Police, with the support of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. Work on infrastructure and on the reconstruction of public buildings destroyed by the earthquake has begun. The country offers excellent investment opportunities in all sectors. Haiti today is on the right track, moving towards a new era of social and economic progress and respect for human rights. We are acting specifically to achieve progress towards a Haiti that is more solidarity-based and more prosperous — a Haiti that the entire world will want to visit to see its extraordinary sights. Long live Haiti!The question of the environment is of major concern to the Haitian Government, because the vegetation cover over a very large area has disappeared. In order to raise awareness among people about the need to replant that vegetation, large-scale programmes have been set up, and others are being drawn up, with the aim of meeting the challenges of replanting, reforestation, providing drinking water and sanitation and protecting ecosystems — all of which have been neglected for far too long. Without appropriate protection of the environment, there will be no sustainable development; no food security is possible for a growing population, nor can there be a decline in poverty and misery.As set forth in the noble Millennium Development Goal on the topic, the Haitian Government, aware of the need for gender equality, has made significant efforts to ensure equality between Haitian men and women. While Haitian society has always accorded an important role to women, the Government has undertaken significant initiatives to enable women to have access to highly responsible positions in public administration. Thirty-five per cent of the Cabinet is made up of women, and they have important portfolios. Much remains to be done to ensure the full emancipation of Haitian women, particularly among the most vulnerable populations. In our country, women deserve better access to education and health-care services.I conclude by asking the Assembly to observe more closely the new Haiti that has been emerging over the past two years despite its day-to-day problems and the extremely difficult legacy, of which we are all aware. That Haiti is one where more girls and boys go to school, where new international-class hotels are opening up their doors every day, breathing new life into our tourism, where the economy is growing at the rate of 4.6 per cent, where inflation has been stabilized at 6.7 per cent, where for the first time foreign direct investment has increased by more than 19 per cent annually, where a fierce fight against smuggling and corruption is being carried out and where today the lowest rate of homicide in the Caribbean is seen. The new Haiti is modernizing the old Haiti little by little and is adopting courageous reforms. The new Haiti is increasingly focusing on constructive dialogue with the countrys social partners — the press, political parties and the private sector. That Haiti has the courage to invest in the worst-off and the poorest, despite a degree of misunderstanding and some criticism. than they are failures on our part, as its Member States, and on the part of those who have the responsibility of leading those States.There would be no dreadful humanitarian situation in Syria if Syrias leaders had upheld the commitments made to the international community and to the Syrian people when Syria joined the Organization and ratified the human rights covenants.The Organization would not also have been a powerless bystander to the Syrian tragedy for over two years if the lack of agreement among the Security Councils permanent members had not shielded the Al-Assad regime, thereby reconfirming the fears of New Zealand and others that had opposed the veto at the original San Francisco Conference, in 1945.New Zealand is pleased that the Security Council has at last met on the situation in Syria. The Secretary-General has advised the Council and the General Assembly that the United Nations Mission has now confirmed, unequivocally and objectively, that chemical weapons have been used in Syria. The report (see ) found clear and convincing evidence that surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent Sarin were used on 21 August.The information in the report also makes it very clear that those rockets must have been fired by the Syrian regime. As the Secretary-General has said, these are war crimes, and those responsible must be brought to account.Those that try to cast doubt on the reports conclusions make themselves look foolish and do a disservice to the United Nations.It is imperative now that the Council act. It must adopt a resolution that responds to the use of chemical weapons. It must find a means to hold those responsible to account and establish an effective mechanism for the destruction of those weapons in line with the proposal developed by the United States and Russia. The resolution must also provide for the protection of the civilian population. While Syria necessarily commands our attention, I also want to spend some time on some more positive developments for both the Organization and its Member States. I want to begin with my own country, New Zealand, whose emergence as a fully independent State has proceeded in parallel with the development of the United Nations."}}
