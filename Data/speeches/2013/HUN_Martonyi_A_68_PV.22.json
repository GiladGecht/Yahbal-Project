{"speech":{"0":" Defining the post-2015 strategy for development is among the most important long-term multilateral agendas existing today. The task is complex, but the mission — to make our common development sustainable — should be clear. It is not just a synonym for the protection of the environment. The mission is to make sure that our societies, economies, environment and partnerships will serve us all and serve the generations to come.By 2030, our population will be 9 billion people, 65 per cent of whom will live in cities, forming consumer societies with ever-growing demands but using the same or a declining pool of natural resources. Civil societies and other non-governmental players have more influence than ever on our values and decisions. We are racing against climate change. Our perceptions of progress, equity, inequality, aff luence and resource management are changing as we speak. The post-2015 development agenda has to reflect these changes.As we face a turning point in our history and the state of the Earth, it is only with a fundamental shift in mindset that humanity will succeed in a transition to global sustainable development. We have to accelerate progress towards the goals set out in the Millennium Development Goals. However, we know that by 2015 we may not be able to meet all the targets we set in 2000. Therefore, the next important step is to create a single agenda through which we will complete the unfinished business and make sure that the results will last even in the light of the tremendous challenges facing humankind.We should aim at eradicating extreme poverty in a single generation. The transformation to sustainable development is costly; however, it would be incomparably more costly to miss the chance. We should learn from past mistakes and find better alternatives. We all need economic growth. We all need justice, respect for human rights, gender equality, dignity, good governance and successfully implemented national development plans. We all deserve to live free of want and from fear of devastating conflicts. Our objective should be not a zero-sum game but a win-win outcome. We all share the consequences; therefore we should be aware of our common responsibility as well.The decisions we make today will also need to be relevant in 15 years. When our successors look back in 2030 on the agenda we are about to decide on, they should acknowledge the purpose, priorities and targets jointly set. They should be convinced that our action had the right impact and made this world a better place.

The next Forum is due to take place in November and will be dedicated, among other things, to the relationship between human rights and sustainable development.Hungary is committed to disarmament and non-proliferation efforts, which are fundamental for maintaining global peace and security. We urge all countries to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention. We also support the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, as foreseen by the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.My country was greatly honoured to chair the International Atomic Energy Agencys International Conference on Nuclear Security in July and sincerely hopes that the results of that Conference will contribute to a safer world.On the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), I am confident that its entry into force will greatly strengthen global peace and security. Only a treaty in force will confine the chapter on nuclear testing to the history books. We therefore need to further intensify our respective efforts. I and my fellow article XIV Coordinator Mr. Marty Natalegawa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, will make an attempt to bring us closer to that goal. I look forward to our co-coordinatorship of the CTBT for the period 2013-2015 with a view to accelerating the ratification process.The use of chemical weapons in Syria was a crime against humanity. The international community has finally embarked on action to ensure that similar attacks will never be repeated. We urge that the perpetrators of all war crimes be brought to justice. Without justice there is no reconciliation. Without a chance for reconciliation, there is no lasting settlement. We welcome the United States-Russia agreement on the framework for the elimination of Syrian chemical weapons as well as the consequent resolutions adopted by the Executive Council of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and the Security Council. We look forward to a timely, transparent and full-scale implementation under the watchful eyes of the international community.Hungary is ready to provide chemical and biological experts on the ground to facilitate those international have shown in Hungary by entrusting us to co-chair the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals. We will do our best to achieve a consensual, forward-looking, win-win formula as the outcome of the negotiating process.Hungary attaches the utmost importance to the issue of water and sanitation. We believe that it needs to be addressed in an integrated way to achieve a human rights-based social development prosperity and ecological balance. Water is a source of life, health, prosperity and a shared future, but it can also be a source of risk.In order to take stock of the various international developments in the field of water, Hungary has decided to organize the Budapest Water Summit, to be held in our capital from 8 to 11 October. Hungary is a downstream country with about 95 per cent of all f luvial waters originating beyond our State borders. We have accumulated precious know-how in f lood control, drinking water, wastewater treatment and irrigation, just to list a few. The Summit will be accompanied by a science forum, a youth forum, a civil society forum, a business leaders forum and Expo, and a philanthropy round table. We look forward to welcoming Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the United Nations agencies active in the field of water, as well as other international and national leaders to the conference. More than 100 countries and international institutions have confirmed they will be represented in Budapest. The Summit will adopt the Budapest Statement, and we hope that it will, as a synthesis document, greatly contribute to and facilitate the discussions and negotiations on the sustainable development goals.The appalling situations in various parts of the world leave no doubt as to the interdependence and mutually reinforcing nature of democracy, peace and security, development and human rights. A cross-policy approach that takes account of those interrelationships should be integrated into the work of the various bodies and forums of the United Nations.Hungary welcomes the measures that the United Nations system is introducing to mainstream human rights. Likewise, it encourages national initiatives and contributions to the protection of human rights. Hungary remains dedicated to the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It was in this spirit that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Hungary established the annual Budapest Human Rights Forum, I could not find a better opportunity than from this rostrum to convey the gratitude of the people and Government of Guinea to the international community and to reiterate my countrys commitment to the principles and purposes of our Organization, . I should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, whose devotion and, above all, competence have strengthened the central role of the United Nations in managing crises and improving the living conditions of our populations.I am firmly convinced that the new President of the General Assembly, Mr. John William Ashe, a man of the South, will understand better than anyone what is at stake in the theme for this session. I assure him of the full cooperation of my delegation in carrying out his noble mission. We also express our great appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremic, for his efforts in maintaining the Assembly at its highest level.World peace and security are at the heart of our concerns and should be the subject of our full attention. A number of conflicts have been ended. Countries such as Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote dIvoire and Burundi have been able to turn the page of war in order to dedicate themselves to peacebuilding, thereby guaranteeing national reconstruction and sustainable development. The international community has the duty to support and assist them.In this context, I should like to evoke the case of Mali, which is emerging from a period of crisis. Sadly, the recent past of that brotherly country reminds us of the vulnerability of our States to terrorism and extremism, as well as the fragility of our institutions. The international community mobilized unanimously to maintain Malis sovereignty and territorial integrity and to restore the authority of its State and constitutional legality.The peace that reigned in the presidential election in Mali certainly augurs a new era of prosperity for the country. Mali urgently needs assistance in order to build peace, reconcile the Malians and rebuild their country. It needs assistance to strengthen its security, which is indivisible from the Sahelo-Saharan region. We must always recall that terrorism never sleeps; we must combat and defeat it. International security is at stake.Guinea will never abandon its solidarity with Mali. Its presence within the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali testifies to our efforts. We urge the Syrian authorities to take full responsibility to ensure that their chemical weapons are stored securely until inspection and destruction, and do not fall into the hands of any other State or non-State actor. Syria should live up to its commitments, including by providing full access to the international inspectors.We hope that these developments will bring us closer to a lasting and sustainable political solution, which should remain the backbone of our efforts in the Syrian crisis. Well over 100,000 lives have already been lost and 5 million people displaced in this conflict. Most regrettably, it was only after a terrible chemical attack last August that the Security Council became ready to fulfil its duties and embarked on action. I urge all partners in the international community to seize this momentum and reinvigorate the process leading to the long-overdue “Geneva II” international peace conference on Syria.Last, but not least, my country is shocked by and strongly condemns the surging terrorist attacks against civilians at the Westgate Mall in Kenya, students in Nigeria, and Christian, Muslim and other communities in Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Our solidarity and sympathy go to the innocent victims."}}
