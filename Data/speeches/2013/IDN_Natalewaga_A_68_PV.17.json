{"speech":{"0":" Let me begin by congratulating His Excellency Ambassador John Ashe on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. May I also take this opportunity to commend His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremic for his skilful stewardship of the sixty-seventh session. Our profound appreciation of course also goes to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his inspirational leadership of the Organization.The theme of this session — “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” — is timely and well-chosen, for we are now making the final push must be strengthened for South-South and triangular cooperation so as to complement official development assistance activities. Strengthening resilience in order to withstand external factors such as climate change and the financial and food crises will have to gain priority under the new agenda.In that regard, Kazakhstans chairmanship of the last and symbolic twentieth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development effected its official transition and handover to the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. The establishment of the High-Level Political Forum is historic as a universal platform to meet current realities, closely linked with global security, which justifies the rationale for a direct nexus between the High-Level Political Forum and the Security Council over the issues of food, the environment, energy and water security.For the first time since its independence, Kazakhstan has announced its candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period 2017 to 2018, based on the principles of fair and equitable geographical rotation and the adequate representation of all States members of the Asia-Pacific regional group. The experience we have gained from recently chairing a number of regional and international organizations and forums, such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Collective Security Treaty Organization and others, gives us unique access to a wide and diverse range of experiences and approaches to solving international security problems addressed by the Security Council.If elected, Kazakhstan will unfailingly be united with others to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security and will support efforts to reform the Council, transforming it into a more representative and transparent body that can effectively address the full range of challenges and threats facing the world today. We therefore count on the broad support of Member States for our candidacy to the Security Council for the period 2017 to 2018.Last year, Kazakhstan celebrated the twentieth anniversary of its accession to the United Nations, and this year the twentieth anniversary of a United Nations presence in our country. Our Government and people strongly support the United Nations in all of sustainable development and inclusive financing and overcoming the challenges of climate change. We have in ourselves the wherewithal to address the development challenges of our time — for example, to work for an early conclusion of the Doha development agenda and a new climate-change regime by 2015.Key to that, however, must be a strong commitment to the spirit of partnership and an unshakeable belief in the power of multilateralism: cooperation and collaboration rather than discord and division. The development agenda must work for all countries, large or small, developed and developing. Each of us must share responsibility. Developed countries must take the lead, while developing countries must do more.The pursuit of a diplomatic path becomes fraught with challenges in a complex and fast-changing world where the issues of governance, human rights violations, extremism and intolerance within countries can quickly gain inter-State dimensions. We must ensure that the institutions of the United Nations are ready to address such contemporary challenges. Therefore, as countries embark upon a process of democratization and the promotion and protection of human rights, as they draw a line against intolerance and extremism, the international community, the United Nations, must contribute towards ensuring an atmosphere that is conducive to their peaceful transformation, one that reflects the wishes of the peoples concerned.Together with its partners in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Indonesia is steadily developing a regional architecture conducive to the peaceful promotion of human rights and democracy. It is called the ASEAN Political-Security Community. Together with the economic community and sociocultural community pillars, it makes up the ASEAN Community that we are to achieve by 2015. Through a process of sharing lessons learned derived from our respective successes and setbacks, we provide mutual encouragement and support in our promotion of the principles of democracy, the rule of law and good governance, and respect for and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms as inscribed in the ASEAN Charter.Beyond South-East Asia, Indonesia is pursuing the same positive and constructive approach through what is called the Bali Democracy Forum, a platform for countries in the wider region to shareone anothers experiences. At all levels — national, regional and towards the fulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals by the 2015 deadline. Simultaneously, work has begun on framing the post-2015 global development agenda to end extreme poverty and ensure sustainable growth with equity. That agenda must be anchored by a new global partnership — a vision reflected in President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyonos role as one of the three co-Chairs of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda and recognition of the fact that the success of the forthcoming intergovernmental process requires the capacity to forge a global consensus to identify and build upon common interests. Indonesia has an enduring belief in the efficacy and effectiveness of diplomacy, maintaining peace and security, advancing social progress and economic prosperity and promoting democracy, human rights and tolerance.The conflict in Syria has long demanded such a political and diplomatic solution, for amid the undoubted complexity of the situation three key points are compelling, namely, halting the violence, facilitating humanitarian relief and beginning an inclusive political process that reflects the wishes of the Syrian people. The recent breakthrough on the issue of chemical weapons in Syria is clear evidence that diplomacy works. Further diplomatic momentum must be generated. The Security Council must be one to forcefully make the case for a peaceful settlement. To get the parties to the negotiating table, the “Geneva II” conference must be convened at the earliest opportunity.On the issue of Palestine, the full weight of diplomatic pressure must similarly be brought to bear and resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council implemented. The historic injustice that the Palestinian people have suffered for so long must be ended. We are encouraged by and welcome, therefore, the resumption of direct negotiations between Palestine and Israel, the result, no less, of painstaking and relentless diplomatic efforts. The revival of the long-stalled nuclear disarmament agenda is also key. In particular, as co-President of the Article XIV Conference on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, Indonesia calls for the early entry into force of the Treaty.The same relentless diplomatic pursuit must be applied to what is manifestly in the common interests of all, that is, the eradication of poverty, the promotion address the critical importance of our relations and cooperation with countries in our region and with the broader community of nations.To better illustrate the journey that Afghanistan and its noble people have been on over the past 12 years, I should like to share two contrasting pictures of the reality of Afghanistan — in the year 2001, at the time of the collapse of the Taliban regime, and in the year 2013, as we are going through a historic period and a process of transition.For a little more than two decades prior to November 2001, when the Afghan people ousted the Taliban regime from power, with military backing from the United States-led international military coalition, the people of Afghanistan suffered incalculable pain, deprivation and losses through three distinct periods. Between the communist coup in 1978, followed by the invasion of our country in 1979, and the fall of the communist regime, more than 1 million Afghan men, women and children were killed, more than 2 million were made orphans or left with severe war wounds, and more than 5 million were forced out of their villages and towns into refugee camps in neighbouring countries, mainly in Pakistan and Iran, as a result of the brutality of the occupation and the communist regime and in the course of our resistance against that occupation. We fought for our freedom and independence — our holy jihad — and we won, in the process helping the national freedom and independence movements in Eastern Europe.The international community that had supported our struggle for several years abandoned us when the defeat and withdrawal of the Red Army became apparent. Exploiting the vacuum and internal strife created during the early 1990s, the foreign-backed Taliban movement rose to power and quickly controlled more than 90 per cent of Afghan territory. Then, equally quickly, they removed their masks and revealed their true identity, holding the Afghan nation hostage and embarking on a period of particularly cruel and barbaric violence and cruelty under the guise of Islam. With their backward views, violence and brutal suppression of the rights and freedoms of the Afghan people, especially women, they turned our country against itself. The international community did not mobilize to take action against the Taliban regime until the terrorist attacks in the United States, including in this city.At the end of 2001, when, with the military backing of the United States-led international coalition, we were getting ready to drive the Taliban regime from power, global — we remain steadfast in promoting tolerance and religious freedom, pushing back against prejudice and intolerance and building partnerships, harmony and mutual respect. Indonesia recognizes, therefore, the special responsibility incumbent upon it as host of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations Global Forum in 2014, one that aims to promote unity in diversity.The primacy of diplomacy and of the peaceful settlement of disputes over war and conflict is not more evident than in the quiet and yet fundamental transformations that have been taking place in our region, South-East Asia. Notwithstanding the continuing challenges, Indonesia believes that the dividends of peace and stability are self-evident: economic and social progress.The continued stability and security of the region is therefore the key to securing our prosperity. Peace and development are indivisible. With other ASEAN nations, Indonesia has worked constantly to develop the regions capacity to manage and overcome any potential for conflict and to ensure that it remains a net contributor to international peace and security; to extend the arc of stability beyond South-East Asia to the Asia-Pacific region at large while promoting common security, common prosperity and common stability for all in the region; and, through commitments to the peaceful settlement of disputes and the renunciation of the use or threat of force, to ensure that the region places diplomacy at the forefront.Indonesia will be tireless in promoting the primacy of diplomacy, and unwavering in its belief in the noble goals of the United Nations."}}
