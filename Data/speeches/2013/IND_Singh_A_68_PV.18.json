{"speech":{"0":" Let me first of all congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. We wish you every success and assure you of our fullest cooperation.At a time when the world is facing multiple challenges, there is renewed attention to the role of the United Nations in advancing international peace, security and prosperity. However, never has scepticism about the capacity of the United Nations to do so been higher, or the external environment less propitious for multilateralism.The nearly seven decades of work of the United Nations hold one simple lesson: that we are most successful when we adhere to the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter, basing our decisions on the widest possible consensus and balancing equitably the needs and responsibilities of nations at different stages and levels of development.In those seven decades, the world has changed in fundamental ways. Asia and Africa are independent and resurgent. Countries are now not only more interdependent, but also face new, increasingly complex challenges. For multilateralism to remain relevant and effective in the future, multilateral institutions need to be reformed urgently. The place to begin is right here.The Security Council must be reformed and restructured to reflect current political realities. More developing countries should be included as both permanent and non-permanent members.The multilateral financial institutions should also enable an enhanced voice for developing countries in their decision-making structures. Multilateral efforts must guide our quest for peace and security, wherever they are threatened, and the centrality and contribution We are encouraged that direct talks have resumed between Israel and Palestine. India supports the early realization of a sovereign, independent, viable and united State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living within secure and recognized borders, side by side and at peace with Israel. We also remain committed to the Palestinian quest for full membership in the United Nations.In our own region, Afghanistan prepares for a historic political, security and economic transition. The international community must support the people of Afghanistan through this transition and beyond in combating terrorism, preserving the progress of the past decade and creating a stable, united and prosperous Afghanistan.Terrorism remains a grave threat to security and stability everywhere and exacts a heavy toll of innocent lives around the world. From Africa to Asia, we have seen several manifestations of this menace in the last few days alone. State-sponsored, cross-border terrorism is of particular concern to India, also on account of the fact that the epicentre of terrorism in our region is located in our neighbourhood, in Pakistan.From this rostrum yesterday, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan spoke of making a new beginning (see ). I reciprocate his sentiments and am looking forward to meeting him tomorrow. India is sincerely committed to resolving all issues with Pakistan, including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, through bilateral dialogue on the basis of the Simla Agreement. However, for progress to be made, it is imperative that the territory of Pakistan and the areas under its control not be utilized for aiding and abetting terrorism directed against India. It is equally important that the terrorist machinery that draws its sustenance from Pakistan be shut down. There must be a clear understanding of the fact that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and that there can never, ever, be a compromise with the unity and territorial integrity of India.We need to renew our commitment, especially here at the United Nations, to concerted, cohesive and continuing global action against terrorism. There can be no tolerance for States sheltering, arming, training or financing terrorists. Nor can States absolve themselves of the responsibility to prevent their territories from being used to launch acts of terrorism.A meaningful post-2015 agenda must place equally high priority on food and nutrition, health, education, infrastructure, water, sanitation, energy and combating discrimination against women. Especially critical is womens equal access to economic opportunities and ensuring that they do not become victims of violence or the targets of prejudice.In India, we have sought to promote inclusive development in multiple ways. Legislation has broadened access to education and secured rural livelihoods. We are now building the worlds largest programme for food security. Digital technology is being harnessed to improve the delivery of public services and benefits to the people.India is proud of its partnerships with developing countries. Using modest resources, we have built strong ties with Africa and the least developed countries. We are committed to building 100 institutions in Africa and have offered capacity-building support, including thousands of scholarships, and made available over $9.5 billion of concessional assistance. India and Africa are engaging through the India-Africa Forum Summit process. We also look forward to participating actively in the third International Conference on Small Island Developing States, to be held in Samoa in 2014, and to contributing to its outcome.Climate change is one of the defining challenges of our times. We must summon the political will necessary to craft a robust global response to climate change on the basis of equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.We are deeply concerned about the future of West Asia, a region with which India shares deep bonds of history and one that is critical for our energy security as well as the livelihoods of the nearly 7 million Indians who work and live in the region. Not only is the increasingly lethal conflict in Syria a tragedy for the people of Syria, but it also threatens stability and security in the region and beyond. It has been made worse by the use of chemical weapons. The use of chemical weapons, whosoever may have deployed them, must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. India strongly supports the elimination of chemical-weapons material and equipment in Syria.There is no military solution to that conflict. We must intensify efforts to end the conflict and seek a political settlement. It is essential that the “Geneva II” conference be convened at the earliest opportunity. to bear in the conduct of our debates and in carrying out the General Assemblys important tasks.At the outset, I would like to commend the remarkable work the United Nations has done so that we have the opportunity to advance the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to work together today to set a new post-2015 development agenda. Indeed, that is a global challenge that, besides inaugurating a new era in global development, challenges us to meet the eight Millennium Development Goals. The focus of this session, as was declared by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, is fairness and dignity for all, a task that challenges everyone and requires new attitudes and behaviours, based on the premise that a better world is possible.Cape Verde, a small island developing State that has been independent for less than 39 years, has already achieved most of the targets envisioned and will continue its efforts to meet all the Millennium Development Goals. Thanks to a transformation agenda that we have been promoting since 2001, when Cape Verde was on the list of least developed countries, our nation has made significant progress in the socioeconomic and political arenas and has improved the peoples overall standard of living. Our focus on and investment in access to education, health care, water and food have been clear, unambiguous and systematic, as have our efforts to competitively integrate our economy into the international market, with the support of our international partners.At the same time, the transformation agenda, which is fully aligned with our MDG commitments and targets, has created the conditions for Cape Verdes historic transition to the realm of middle-income countries, although, owing to the strong impact of the international crisis, which has to some extent put the brakes on the momentum of the countrys ongoing progress, it still falls within the lower-middle-income scale. Our indicators show that we have reduced poverty by half, and it is clearly on a downward trend. Our current challenge is the close monitoring essential to preventing any setbacks that might result from the global economic situation and its impact on Cape Verde. In fact, despite our graduation to middle-income-country status, our indicators still show high rates of poverty, inequality and unemployment, as well as insufficient access to many goods and services, and we are still short of our goal of achieving well-being and and a high standard of living for all our people.The increasingly complex challenges to international peace and security require a new international consensus to be built, whether it is in the field of cybersecurity, non-proliferation or terrorism. This year, 25 years after Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi put forward a comprehensive action plan for a nuclear-weapon-free and non-violent world order, we must strengthen efforts against nuclear proliferation and pursue time-bound, universal, non-discriminatory, phased and verifiable nuclear disarmament. We must also guard against terrorists and non-State actors gaining access to sensitive materials and technologies.Two years from now, the United Nations will be 70 years old. Every new State born during that period of 70 years has taken its place in the Assembly not just with pride but also with hope. The year 2015 will be a time to celebrate our successes and ensure that the United Nations is ready for this century, by completing much-needed reforms of the Organization and its Security Council, developing an ambitious and balanced post-2015 development agenda and demonstrating our capacity to cooperate effectively for durable peace and security in the world we live in."}}
