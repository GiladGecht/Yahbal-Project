{"speech":{"0":" Mr. President, at the outset, I would like to offer my most sincere felicitations on your deserved election as President of the General Assembly and to seize the moment to express appreciation for the valuable efforts of the Secretary-General.Our world today is replete with fear and hope — fear of war and hostile regional and global relations; fear of deadly confrontation between religious, ethnic and national identities; fear of the institutionalization of violence and extremism; fear of poverty and destructive discrimination; fear of decay and the destruction of life-sustaining resources; fear of the disregard for human dignity and rights; and fear of the neglect of morality. Alongside those fears, however, there are new hopes — the hope of the universal acceptance of “yes to peace and no to war” by the people and the elite all across the globe; and the hope that dialogue will be preferred over conflict and moderation over extremism.The recent election in Iran represents a clear, living example of the wise choice for hope, rationality and moderation by the great people of Iran. The realization of democracy consistent with religion and the peaceful transfer of executive power showed that Iran is an anchor of stability in an ocean of regional instabilities. The firm belief of our people and Government in enduring peace, stability, tranquillity, the peaceful resolution of disputes and the reliance on the ballot box as the basis of power, public acceptance and legitimacy has indeed played a key role in creating such a safe environment.The current critical period of transition in international relations is replete with dangers, albeit also with unique opportunities. Any miscalculation of ones own position, and of course those of others, will cause damage on a historic scale; a mistake by one actor will have a negative impact on all others. Vulnerability is now a global and indivisible phenomenon.At this sensitive juncture in the history of global relations, the age of zero-sum games is over, even though a few actors still tend to rely on archaic and deeply ineffective ways and means of preserving their old superiority and domination. Militarism and the recourse to violent and military means for the purposes States, under the aegis of the African Development Bank. Of the estimated 7 billion people in the world, 1.5 billion live in situations of conflict and fragility. That data puts fragile States at the centre of the new post-2015 agenda. We hold the view that international partners should accommodate the peculiarities and special circumstances of post-conflict nations. The achievement of sustained economic growth and development in those countries is critical to reducing their vulnerability to new political and economic shocks, fuelled in many cases by high expectation gaps that need to be mitigated. We therefore call on all our partners to renew their support to the New Deal for Engagement on Fragile States, which calls for stronger ownership, harmonization, results and mutual accountability.The President returned to the Chair.I would like to conclude by expressing our gratitude to the United Nations family for sustaining our agenda of peacebuilding and sustainable development. Since its founding, the United Nations has had its share of challenges, but it remains the beacon of hope for the peoples of the world who thirst for peace; a world that is fair, a world that is prosperous, a world in which the uncommon dreams of all will have a fair chance of realization; a world where the weak can become strong; a world where no nation feels developed and powerful until all nations have their share of global wealth. The leaders of today must rise to those challenges. The future begins today. We must commit to a new global development trajectory that gives all of humankind a world of peace, dignity and prosperity."}}
