{"speech":{"0":" I have great pleasure in participating in the current session of the General Assembly to discuss the vital issue of post-2015 sustainable development and the achievement of its goals, which we all hope to be able to accomplish.Having overcome the serious consequences of the economic, political and social policies pursued by the former regime, which were not based on scientific grounds but on the regimes personal reckless whims, Iraq has sought to translate what was agreed upon by world leaders in 2000, notably the development goals, into practical and concrete steps. By adopting plans, strategies and enacting laws that provide for the necessary mechanisms, Iraq has endeavoured to achieve the essence of sustainable development, namely, the integration of its three dimensions: economic, environmental and social.Iraq has been working on financial and monetary policies to increase the financial f lows to its public budget, which is expected to reach approximately $150 billion in 2015, 40 per cent of which is envisioned to be allocated to the requisite investment expenditure in order to provide basic services, improve infrastructure and strengthen the Iraqi economy.Iraq is expected to achieve steady growth in the economic sectors through its 2013-2017 development plan. However, oil is still the main engine driving the other sectors, thanks to Iraqs abundant oil and gas reserves, which surpass confirmed reserve estimates by a very large margin. Estimates put the potential of extractable oil reserves at 250 billion barrels and that of gas at more than 250 trillion cubic feet.take this opportunity to reiterate the solidarity and full support of the people and the Government of Mali for the Palestinian people in their legitimate struggle for the exercise of their inalienable right to sovereignty.I welcome the measures taken in recent years by the United Nations to bring about qualitative changes in the priority fields of development, peace and collective security, as well as human rights, and to reform the Organization. Despite the progress achieved, much remains to be done, especially concerning the necessary reform of the Security Council and the revitalization of the General Assembly. We must continue our efforts to ensure that the General Assembly, the main deliberative organ of the Organization, occupies a central position, with the means to implement its resolutions.Turning now to the reform of the Security Council, Mali reiterates its commitment to the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration adopted by the heads of State and Government of the African Union, and supports the legitimate demands by Africa to have two permanent seats and five non-permanent seats in the Security Council.The Security Council thus reformed would better reflect the geopolitical realities of todays world and would repair the “historical injustice” done to Africa, the only region of the world that does not have a permanent seat on the Council.Mali is back. Mali now takes back its place, its rightful place in keeping with its rich history, in the community of free and democratic States. The Malian people stand ready to take part, to play a full-f ledged role in building a world of peace, tolerance, freedom, justice and democracy. Malians remain convinced that it is along that path that we, the leaders of the world, will lay the milestones of sustainable development for our peoples and will spare present and future generations the scourge of war. That is our mission and, God willing, we will accomplish it."}}
