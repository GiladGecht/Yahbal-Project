{"speech":{"0":" First, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session.I would now like to make a new pledge about the situation in Syria. The use of chemical weapons has caused profound shock and anger on the part of the people of Japan, including myself. Chemical weapons must never be used again. I hereby declare that Japan will provide thorough support to, and the greatest possible cooperation with, the international communitys efforts to dispose of Syrias chemical weapons. We feel righteous indignation about innocent civilians continuing to be victims. Japan regards the cessation of violence, the initiation of political dialogue and the improvement of the appalling humanitarian conditions as issues of the utmost urgency. At this very moment, the number of refugees is soaring. To them, Japan will provide still greater assistance. We will act in cooperation with the international community to extend a helping hand to internally displaced persons and refugees f leeing across national borders. I take pride in the fact that Japans non-governmental organizations and volunteer organizations are working around the clock to help them.Japan will also continue to provide assistance to areas under the control of the opposition groups, where it is difficult for assistance from the international community to reach. We are working to undertake the training of staff working at medical centres. We will also deliver portable X-ray devices and other medical equipment to those areas. that occasion, I was deeply struck by the eagerness expressed by representatives of African nations for private sector investment. Investment f low to Africa now exceeds the f low of assistance. I also heard from the African leaders time and again that assistance should be utilized strategically as a catalyst for attracting investment. That is the evolution that discussions in the 20-year-long TICAD process have witnessed and given rise to. TICAD V became a forum where we celebrated the path that Africa has walked down, and together we reconfirmed that Japan has been an enduring partner weaving dreams side by side with Africa.I hold the firm conviction that the future course of Japans diplomacy will begin here, by sparing no pains — and with our regained strength and capacity — to become actively engaged in meeting the historic challenges that todays world faces. I consider “sparing no pains” to be nothing less than the basso continuo notes that set the basic tone for Japans actions, be they in diplomacy or any other field.As a country with such intentions, strengths and achievements, Japan considers it extremely regrettable that the structure of the Security Council is still frozen in a state that reflects the realities of some 70 years ago. Security Council reform must proceed without delay. Japans aspirations to becoming a permanent member of the Council have not changed in the slightest.Everything begins with Japan refortifying its true abilities and its economy. The growth of Japan will benefit the world. Japans decline would be a loss for people everywhere. How, then, does Japan aim to realize its growth? Mobilizing the power of women will serve as both a source and outcome of growth, a point almost self-evident at this gathering.There is a theory called “womenomics”, which asserts that the more the advancement of women in society is promoted, the more growth increases. Creating an environment in which women find it comfortable to work and enhancing opportunities for women to work and to be active in society is no longer a matter of choice for Japan. It is instead a matter of the greatest urgency.Having declared my intention to create a society in which women shine, I have been working to change Japans domestic structures. However, that is not confined merely to domestic matters. I would now I will enable Japan, as a proactive contributor to peace, to be even more actively engaged in United Nations collective security measures, including peacekeeping operations. I believe that Japan must continually cultivate our human resources so that they are appropriate for use in United Nations activities.For Japan, whose national interests are firmly connected to the stability of open seas, changes to the maritime order through the use of force or coercion cannot be condoned under any circumstances. Japan has great expectations that public spaces, ranging from outer space and cyberspace to the skies and the seas, will be rigorously preserved as global commons governed by rules and laws.Japan, as a country that understands the horror and devastation wrought by atomic bombs, will utterly devote itself to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and the total elimination of nuclear weapons. North Koreas nuclear and missile development cannot be condoned. Japan also maintains serious concerns with respect to other weapons of mass destruction that North Korea is likely to possess. Pyongyang should listen to the unified voice of the international community and rectify its own actions by taking a tangible step. We demand that North Korea return every Japanese national whom it has abducted, without exception. While in office, I am determined to resolve that issue completely. The normalization of diplomatic relations with North Korea remains unthinkable without the resolution of that issue.As for the nuclear issue of Iran, Japan hopes that the countrys new Administration will move forward with concrete actions. We are ready to continue to play a role in resolving the issue.In the Middle East region, a cornerstone for world peace and prosperity, Japan will continue its unique contributions towards the Middle East peace process.Japan will also continue to extend cooperation to the countries of Africa, which are certain to become a growth engine in the twenty-first century. Firmly rooted in our own experiences, that cooperation takes the fostering of human resources as its main emphasis and seeks to achieve sustainable growth while cultivating ownership by Africa itself. In June, my Government invited African Heads of State and Government and representatives of international organizations to Japan, where it convened the fifth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD V). On use of public entertainment to persuade the villagers, Ms. Sato finally found herself accepted by the village community. Ms. Satos tenacity gradually transformed the traditional idea that the one who decides the number of children is the husband, not the wife, into a mindset that values the health of women.As the Assembly is aware, my country played a leading role in the establishment of the the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Japan intends to continue to make an appropriate contribution at the upcoming Fourth Replenishment, which seeks to secure additional financing for the Fund. However, as for the post-2015 development agenda, it would be most appropriate to broaden the focus to encompass those diseases individually. Japan regards approaches that address individuals holistically as better able to meet their broader health needs. That is why Japan decided to promote universal health coverage — “UHC — on the occasion of TICAD V. To address health issues in the African region, we have readied $500 million and are at present concentrating on setting up training for 120,000 health and medical services providers. With regard to medical care for all, there can be no doubt that the people who give the human touch to the three letters in “UHC” are, in concrete terms, people like Ms. Sato, who without hesitation go into local communities. The second person I would like to introduce is Ms. Nilufa Yeasmin, a young Bangladeshi woman and the mother of two. Her professional title is “Poly-Glu Lady”. Poly-Glu is a made-in-Japan water purifier derived from a food that can be found in Japan in great abundance. One simply adds it to turbid water. Poly-Glu acts as an adsorbent, adhering to excess substances in the water, and then falls to the bottom as a precipitate, leaving the water clear. It is necessary to teach people how to use it correctly at the outset, and Ms. Yeasmin and other Poly-Glu ladies serve as both salespersons and instructors.As members can see, as with what is called a “base of the pyramid” business, that endeavour is characterized by the expectations placed on the power of women. By combining her income with her husbands, Ms. Yeasmin has been able to send her children to an institution of higher education. Poverty caused her to give up on the dream she had cherished as a little girl of becoming a doctor someday. But I understand that now she proudly states she has become a doctor of clean water. Can we like to discuss how it is also an issue guiding Japans diplomacy. To begin with, I would like to state four contributions through which Japan aspires to remain a leading member within the international community. First, Japan respects the activities of UN-Women and intends to become one of its leading contributors, and therefore an exemplary country in that area. Japan will also work closely with the relevant international organizations.Secondly, as other like-minded countries have already done, Japan also intends to develop a national action plan with regard to women, peace and security, in cooperation with people working at the grass-roots level. Thirdly, Japan will cooperate closely with not only UN-Women, but also the International Criminal Court and the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms. Zainab Hawa Bangura. It is an outrage that there continues to be sexual violence against women during times of armed conflict even now, in the twenty-first century. Japan will do everything possible to prevent such crimes against women and to support — both materially and psychologically — those people who unfortunately become victims of such acts.Fourthly, Japan will submit once more at the next session of the Commission on the Status of Women a draft resolution that gives careful consideration to women in natural disasters, as they are likely to be vulnerable. Japan, which experienced a major natural disaster two years ago, wishes to garner support for the draft resolution, which embodies our outpouring of support for the matter.I would now like to make use of the examples of three individuals to clarify Japans development concept aimed at bringing about a society in which women shine, and also to shed light on some issues that must be tackled. I will first introduce the examples of a Japanese woman and a Bangladeshi woman, and then that of an Afghan woman, as the third example.Ms. Tokiko Sato was an expert at the Japan International Cooperation Agency, responsible for improving maternal, newborn and child health for over 15 years in a remote village in Jordan. Undaunted by the suspicious looks she initially received from the villagers, Ms. Sato would speak with anyone, anywhere. Devoted to her ideas, including making of maternal, newborn and child health, an MDG whose attainment has been conspicuously slow. My Administration will, as its second priority policy area, engage greater efforts towards womens health and medical care.Finally, what I hoped to convey through the tragic example of Islam Bibi is the importance of womens participation and their protection in the context of peace and security. Japan intends to promote measures to ensure womens participation at all stages — including in conflict prevention and resolution and in peacebuilding — and to safeguard their rights and the physical well-being of women who are exposed to danger in times of conflict.I would like to state here that in establishing those three pillars, the Government of Japan will direct official development assistance in excess of $3 billion over the next three years, to target the pillars.In conclusion, if we were to follow the wisdom of the so-called “womenomics” theory, as mentioned earlier, the development concept aimed at cultivating the power of women would generate greater peace and well-being in the world. I wish to bring about a society where women shine, within Japan and in conflict regions and countries suffering from poverty. In that context, I do not consider the outlook to be optimistic. However, I know one thing: in Japan a considerable number of people are working unsparingly towards that end. They are the people who are making every effort to ready themselves to be able to work together, in unity."}}
