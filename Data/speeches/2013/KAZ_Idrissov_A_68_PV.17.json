{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of the Republic of Kazakhstan, I should like first to congratulate His Excellency Mr. John Ashe on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and to wish him every success in his important functions. I should also like to take this opportunity to express our profound gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremic, President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, for his able stewardship, energy and dedication in finding solutions to critical international challenges.Since we met here at the United Nations a year ago the world situation has not improved but, on the contrary, has deteriorated, becoming more fragile and vulnerable to new risks and threats. A growing number of States in the Middle East and Africa, which were making steady progress, both economically and socially, ensure progress in the dialogue between the group of international mediators and Iran, Kazakhstan hosted two rounds of negotiations in Almaty this year. Specific agreements have yet to be reached, but we are confident that a mutually acceptable outcome is possible. We believe that concrete actions by Iran to ensure the transparency and peaceful nature of its nuclear programme, along with reciprocal constructive steps on the part of the group of six, will advance the settlement of the problem, rather than relying on sanctions alone. We all witnessed the latest positive signs of understanding on that issue during the current session and wholeheartedly welcomed them, remaining fully available to contribute to a productive negotiation process.We express our grave concern about North Koreas nuclear programme. Attempts to engage in the secret development of nuclear weapons in violation of international obligations cannot be justified under any circumstances. At the same time, Kazakhstan is against a military solution to the problem, since we are convinced that only the peaceful settlement of that crisis, within the framework of the Six-Party Talks, can ensure peace and stability in North-East Asia. Kazakhstan is genuinely interested in the sustainable and stable development of Afghanistan through its transformation into a politically stable and economically viable State in keeping with the decisions of the ministerial conference of the Istanbul Process held in Almaty last April. We support the rapid integration of Afghanistan into the regional framework so as to promote its speedy social and economic recovery.The Asian continent is transforming itself into a global powerhouse for the twenty-first century, with its production of more than 57 per cent of global gross domestic product — a trend that is expected to increase. However, that growth could be jeopardized by an aggravation of existing conflicts, illegal migration, drug trafficking, territorial claims, separatism, religious extremism and terrorism. To cope with those challenges, Asia needs a regional security architecture. Kazakhstan, as the host of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia, is striving to maximize opportunities for joint decision-making on security and cooperation in Asia.Kazakhstan is committed to the fundamental principles of international law, among which respect for human rights and freedom, based on impartiality and non-politicization, is deemed pivotal for a fundamental pillars of the Treaty — non-proliferation, the peaceful use of nuclear energy and disarmament — in a balanced way. We call on all non-NPT countries possessing nuclear weapons to sign the Treaty and on all States parties not to withdraw. The entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) should become an important catalyst in the non-proliferation process, promoting the effective implementation of the NPT. We urge those countries that have not yet done so to sign and ratify that important document. The General Assembly resolution initiated by Kazakhstan establishing 29 August as the International Day against Nuclear Tests (resolution ) matches the goals and objectives for the entry into force of the CTBT.The Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia, which came into force in March 2009, represents an important contribution by the Central Asian countries to international and regional security. It is the first nuclear-weapon-free zone established in the northern hemisphere and shares common borders with two major nuclear Powers. It is also the first such zone where previously nuclear weapons had existed. Kazakhstan welcomes the willingness of the five permanent members of the Security Council to hold a dialogue on the Additional Protocol with the five countries in the zone and to provide negative assurances as soon as possible.Kazakhstan supports the early convening of the conference on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction under the auspices of the United Nations and calls upon all States in the region actively to cooperate to make that important undertaking possible.In order to take further decisive actions to eliminate the nuclear threat, President Nursultan Nazarbaev of the Republic of Kazakhstan has proposed the adoption of a universal declaration for a nuclear-weapon-free world, which would be an important step towards a nuclear-weapons prohibition convention, and thereby achieving a nuclear-weapon-free world. We count on Member States to finalize and submit a draft resolution on the universal declaration of the General Assembly at this session.We support an immediate political and diplomatic settlement of the situation concerning the Iranian nuclear programme on the basis of strict compliance with the provisions of the NPT and the International Atomic Energy Agency regulations. In order to The second World Anti-Crisis Conference, which is to be held next May in Kazakhstan, will draft the world anti-crisis plan to combat the financial and economic crisis so as to ensure long-term sustainable economic growth.We are pleased to note the commendable work of the United Nations in implementing the agreements reached at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development held in Rio de Janeiro (Rio+20), and Kazakhstan is actively contributing to that work. A national plan for transitioning to a green economy has been developed, with programmes in key sectors of the economy — energy, water, utilities, agriculture, industry and biodiversity. Kazakhstan has also initiated the transition to a green economy in Central Asia within the framework of the regional Intergovernmental Commission on Sustainable Development. The Rio+20 Conference supported the Kazakhstan-sponsored Green Bridge Partnership Programme as a voluntary framework for mutually beneficial cooperation between the developed and developing world in the interests of sustainable development. Next Monday, 30 September, Kazakhstan will host the International Conference on the Green Bridge Partnership Programme in Astana with the participation of regional countries, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the Economic Commission for Europe and other stakeholders. At that Conference the programme will be institutionalized and its secretariat established.Kazakhstan has made voluntary commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions within the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions and investing in low-carbon development, all of which constitute Kazakhstans contribution to the Secretary-Generals global Sustainable Energy for All initiative and other initiatives aimed at sustainable development.I am pleased to inform members that Kazakhstans capital, Astana, will host the international exhibition EXPO 2017, entitled “Energy for the Future”, which is designed to disseminate best practices in the field of sustainable energy. On the basis of national consultations, we have developed a number of recommendations on development goals for the post-2015 agenda and submitted them to the United Nations. We believe that those Millennium Development Goals that were not reached must be included in the post-2015 agenda, in conjunction with the objectives of sustainable development. International partnerships sustainable, universal and effective global architecture for protecting human rights. That, among other things, requires appropriate budgeting and the strengthening of the Human Rights Council and its special procedures, in particular the universal periodic review and the institution of special rapporteurs, as well as supporting the capacity and authority of United Nations human rights mechanisms.We need to implement civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights at the national, regional and global levels while paying particular attention to vulnerable groups. Kazakhstan, as a multiethnic and multi-confessional country, can facilitate a comprehensive dialogue among civilizations within the United Nations and various international and regional organizations. The Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions, which Kazakhstan convenes every three years, contributes to global and regional security by mobilizing the spiritual and moral potential of world religions to mitigate international conflicts so as to prevent confrontations between faiths and cultures.Additionally, at the initiative of Kazakhstan, the General Assembly proclaimed the period between 2013 and 2022 as the International Decade for the Rapprochement of Cultures. Its official inauguration was held in Astana last month, thereby paving the way for cultural diversity and tolerance. Kazakhstan calls on Member States actively to participate in the events of the Decade and to support synergy between the Alliance of Civilizations and the Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions.The consequences of the global financial and economic crisis have led to the conclusion that the world needs a common policy of global governance. Kazakhstan therefore welcomes the adoption of the resolution on the United Nations in global economic governance (resolution ), which recognizes the value of cooperation and interaction between the United Nations and various regional and subregional groups.Over the years, Kazakhstan has hosted the Astana Economic Forum, which is now a reputed international platform that covers the most pressing and ever-expanding issues of the world economy. The first World Anti-Crisis Conference was held as part of the Forum last May in Astana. The Astana Declaration, the recommendations of the Astana Economic Forum to the Group of 20 leaders and the road map of the World Anti-Crisis Plan were adopted as outcome documents. its programmes. Kazakhstan acts as a geographical and political bridge between North and South, Europe and Asia. For that reason, it is ideally suited to foster cooperative initiatives in that vast regional landscape. Promoting Kazakhstan to the status of a middle-income country represents both challenges and opportunities for the development agenda, shifting the focus from being a recipient country to that of a regional development partner.Regional cooperation is critical to ensuring national and regional security. Persistent conflict and instability in Afghanistan also have an effect on Central Asia. Poverty, unemployment and growing disparities in economic and social development in the countries of Central Asia are strong factors indicating the potential for new mass population movements, instability, environmental degradation, drug trafficking, religious extremism and terrorism, all of which must be addressed through regional cooperation. Such collaboration can be facilitated through the establishment of a United Nations multi-country centre in Kazakhstan in the city of Almaty as a hub for promoting regional development, security and stability. Kazakhstan is ready to bear all the costs for the construction, equipping and maintenance of such a United Nations office bridging the gap between Vienna and Bangkok.The 20 years of Kazakhstans membership and cooperation with the United Nations have been characterized by the highest dedication to the ideals and principles of the world Organization. We will continue to play the role of an engaged and responsible Member State, ready to take on increased responsibilities and consistently implement them in full."}}
