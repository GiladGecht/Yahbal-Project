{"speech":{"0":" Thirteen years have passed since the adoption of the Millennium Declaration (resolution ), and the established deadline to achieve the Millennium Development Goals is rapidly approaching. The world has changed since then, and we anticipate that, in the next 15 years, it will change a great deal more. In that context, the main theme of the general debate, “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”, is obviously very appropriate and relevant. We are convinced that the new development agenda will provide a clear vision for our post-2015 development. It should be formulated in the best spirit of the Millennium Development Goals, with special attention to the issues of poverty eradication, education and health care, the economy and employment, governance, agriculture and food availability, energy, peace and security.The need for a common agenda is unquestionable. All countries must enthusiastically embark on the path of sustainable development. The global challenges can be effectively met if they are included as core priorities in each countrys development strategy. Central Asia”. We call on members to support the draft resolution.It is well known that development and security are closely interrelated. Unfortunately, the maintenance of security and stability and the fight against international terrorism, religious extremism, and illicit drug and arms trafficking and trade remain on the development agenda of Kyrgyzstan and our region. Those issues are most acute in our region because of the current situation in Afghanistan. Despite some progress in the political process in Afghanistan, the stability and security of the country remain at risk. Furthermore, the Afghan drug-production trade, being the largest in the world, is generating a whole range of threats and destabilizing both the political and military situation in Eurasia. Those problems are more critical and significant in our region than ever before, especially in view of the upcoming withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan in 2014.Kyrgyzstan, in accordance with its commitments, has fully complied with its mission in counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan. Over the past 12 years, Kyrgyzstan has provided an important channel for the supply of military and humanitarian goods to Afghanistan through the transit centre at Manas International Airport. We believe that the international communitys efforts have contributed to the relative stabilization of the situation in Afghanistan and helped the Afghan authorities to assume their leadership role and responsibility in the fields of public administration and development. We are determined to continue our strategic dialogue with partners on all issues of mutual interest. We believe that in the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking and other security challenges stemming from Afghanistan, regional organizations have proved their effectiveness and should be even more involved. I am talking here in particular of the Collective Security Treaty Organization and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Kyrgyzstans chairmanship of those international and regional organizations this year has once again confirmed the need to have comprehensive measures in place to stabilize the situation as soon as possible, both in Afghanistan and in the region as a whole. Along with other measures to combat security challenges and threats, it is necessary to pursue a policy of industrialization aimed at building a sustainable best practices in water management, water use and the construction of irrigation systems.More than 90 per cent of Kyrgyzstan is located in mountainous areas, which play an important role in the accumulation of water. In that regard, we support the further promotion of the developmental goals of the mountain regions, in accordance with the decisions taken at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. I am confident that a draft resolution on the issue, to be submitted to the General Assembly at this session with the co-sponsorship of Kyrgyzstan, will enjoy the support of all United Nations Members.Some mountainous landlocked countries have special needs for development. High levels of poverty, isolation, the burden of transportation costs and a heavy debt are among the basic range of problems that many mountainous countries face. In such conditions, it is difficult to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to meet the commitments set out in United Nations documents on sustainable development. We hope that the special needs, problems and challenges of mountain countries and communities will be properly reflected in the post-2015 development programme.It is well known that mountain ranges provide valuable ecosystem services and serve as important indicator of environmental health and a support system for the snow leopard, a rare and endangered highland animal. In that regard, Kyrgyzstan is developing a 10-year national protection strategy. We invite everyone to the world forum on the snow leopard to be held on 22 and 23 October in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. The rehabilitation and security of uranium tailings, which today total more than 8 million cubic metres on our territory, is very important in Kyrgyzstan. The situation is aggravated by the fact that most are located in seismically active mudflow and f lood-prone areas with high groundwater levels, as well near the banks of rivers that form the basis of the Central Asian water supply. The potential consequences of ineffective solutions would have a very negative impact on millions of people in Central Asia.In order to raise the international communitys awareness of the problem and to attract additional assistance towards its solution, at this session the Kyrgyz delegation will introduce a draft resolution under agenda item 19 (j), “The role of the international community in the prevention of the radiation threat in That can be achieved through reforming the United Nations, which should be done in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and on the basis of a broad consensus on the part of States Members of the United Nations.We believe that all States Members of the United Nations should strictly comply with the decisions of the Security Council; we are in favour of expanding its membership in order to make it more representative, transparent and democratic.We attach particular importance to the work of the Economic and Social Council. Kyrgyzstan therefore welcomed the adoption last week of resolution , on strengthening the role and enhancing the effectiveness of the work of the Council. We hope that a strengthened Council will become an effective mechanism for the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda and continue to serve as an important platform for multilateral political dialogue on global social and economic issues.In conclusion, I would like to emphasize the need to move forward firmly and resolutely by means of joint efforts and a common resolve on the part of all countries in order to overcome threats and challenges, maintain peace and well-being and promote development for future generations. Kyrgyzstan is fully prepared to engage in such constructive and effective international cooperation."}}
