{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, I would like to congratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. My delegation has full confidence that under his able leadership the new session will draw to a successful conclusion. The President can rest assured of Cambodias full support and cooperation throughout his presidency.This year sessions theme, “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage,” is very timely as we have less than 1,000 days to reach the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets. That development agenda will be one of the most ambitious projects undertaken by the United Nations, in which all demining and clearance of other unexploded ordnance as an additional MDG of its own. Substantial progress has been made in realizing that goal, as is demonstrated by the sharp decline in the number of mine explosion accidents in Cambodia, from over 300 cases in 2008 to 186 in 2012. As Chair of the Eleventh Meeting of the States Parties to the Mine Ban Treaty, or Ottawa Treaty, Cambodia made a strong commitment to work towards a world free of landmines and unexploded ordnance. Since 2006, Cambodia has contributed to United Nations peacekeeping operations by sending mine-clearance experts to a number of countries in Africa and the Middle East, including the Sudan, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, Chad and Lebanon, and very soon to Mali.On the situation in the Korean peninsula, we welcome the positive developments between North Korea and South Korea, which, I hope, will lead to a significant improvement in inter-Korean relations and the resumption of the Six-Party Talks. We encourage the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea to comply fully with its obligations to cease its nuclear programme, as spelled out by the relevant Security Council resolutions.My country reaffirms its support for the Palestinian peoples just demand for a sovereign and independent State of Palestine and for the two-State solution to the Palestine-Israel conflict. We urge all parties to play a constructive role in the efforts aimed at resuming peace talks and to remove any obstacles standing in the way of such resumption.With regard to the Syrian situation, Cambodia strongly condemns human rights violations and the use of chemical weapons. My delegation fully supports Security Council resolution 2118 (2013), adopted on Friday with the aim of destroying Syrias chemical weapons.My delegation also calls for an end to the unilateral embargo on Cuba, which has caused the Cuban people decades of untold suffering.We are seriously concerned about the extensive levels of sexual violence inflicted on innocent women and children in armed conflicts around the world. My country endorses the declaration of commitment on ending sexual violence in conflict, issued on 24 September at a side event during the general debate.The President took the Chair.Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through Sustainable Development, and which sets forth a universal agenda to eradicate extreme poverty from our world by 2030 and to deliver on the promise of sustainable development.Cambodia believes that the post-2015 development agenda should carry forward the spirit of the Millennium Declaration in various ways: first, by setting out a balanced integration of the economic, social and environmental dimensions for sustainable development; secondly, by aiming at the completion of the work started under the MDGs, particularly the goal of eradicating extreme poverty; thirdly, by emphasizing inclusive, equitable and sustainable development and economic growth aimed at effectively addressing inequality and any associated factors; and, fourthly, by focusing not only on the global dimension of development, but also on its regional dimension, while taking into account the particular challenges of the least developed countries.With regard to the nineteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Warsaw in November, my country has high hopes that the Conference will ratify the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol by 2015. Cambodia greatly appreciates the developed countries continued commitment to providing funds and technology to help developing nations tackle climate change, in accordance with the United Nations principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.Global and regional peace and security are currently threatened by conflicts, armed confrontation and transnational organized crime, which take a heavy toll on many development efforts. Against that backdrop, Cambodia welcomes the signing of the Arms Trade Treaty, the first ever international treaty to regulate the trade of conventional weapons.Another security issue is the presence of landmines and other explosive remnants of war, which continue to pose constant threats to human security and safety and hinder national development. To counter those threats, last year in Phnom Penh the leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) decided to establish the ASEAN Regional Mine Action Center and to base it in Cambodia.For its part, Cambodia has spared no effort to address the issue of landmines. To that end, it has established development that is inclusive and sustainable. As a result, our Government has kept our people at the centre of development.We have been able to bring significant improvements in the lives of our people and to attain all the Millennium Development Goals, despite our limitations. We have reduced poverty and hunger by more than half. Our children, boys and girls, now have universal access to both primary and secondary education, as well as expanded access to post-secondary education and training. Our girls and women are not only being treated as equals with boys and men but have received tremendous support in improving their living conditions. Our elderly people and children enjoy free access to public health care.Dominica has continued to maintain its coveted title of “nature island of the Caribbean” by adhering to self-imposed sustainable environmental practices over the past several decades, a model that we hope more States around the world can emulate.As we approach 2015, we must resolve to take stock. We must be forever mindful that those who are condemned to poverty still await our intervention. The more than 1 billion people who have known only darkness at the end of each day long for at least one light bulb in a rural home so that their children can have opportunities for a brighter tomorrow. We have run out of excuses for why we are still waiting to act or cannot act. Rest assured that our people will judge us harshly for failing to make a difference in their lives.Despite the current global challenges, South-South cooperation continues to play a significant role in helping small countries like Dominica to achieve their Millennium Development Goals. The Government and people of Dominica express their sincere gratitude to the Governments of the Peoples Republic of China, Venezuela, Cuba, Morocco, the European Union, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America and other bilateral and multilateral partners for the tremendous contributions they have made, and continue to make, in the development of our human-resource capacity and infrastructure and in the implementation of our public-sector investment programme.Our commitment to the MDGs should consist of a redoubling of efforts towards a post-2015 agenda that will bring about development that is inclusive and sustainable. The outcome of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (resolution Since the establishment of the United Nations, in 1945, the world situation has changed so dramatically that there is an urgent need to strengthen global diplomacy. In that context, the reform of the United Nations should be comprehensive and include not only the Security Council but also other organs, so as to maintain the Organizations relevance as a global governance institution that can cope effectively with world reality. The General Assembly should be empowered to play a greater leading role in strengthening the wider United Nations system, improving international governance and enhancing multilateralism. At the same time, the Economic and Social Council should also be strengthened, so that it can effectively coordinate international cooperation and efforts to tackle social and economic challenges. Both the permanent and non-permanent membership categories of the Security Council should be expanded in an equitable manner, so that the Council represents both developed and developing countries. A comprehensive reform of the Council to make it a body where real negotiations and compromises can take place is acutely needed."}}
