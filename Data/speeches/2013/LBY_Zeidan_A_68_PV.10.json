{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, I warmly congratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election as President of the General Assembly. I wish him every success in his endeavours. I also wish to convey my greetings to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon and to commend him and his team for the remarkable efforts they continue to exert in the realization of the lofty purposes and principles that have been at the heart of the United Nations since its inception.I have the honour to speak before the Assembly today on behalf of my country, the new Libya, which is forging ahead towards democracy, establishing State institutions, the rule of law, development and prosperity, despite the range of political, economic, social and cultural difficulties and obstacles we face as a result of the burdensome legacy left behind by the any compromise thereof, especially in some countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, where coercive measures have caused significant damage to those investments.My country attaches great importance to human rights issues and to the process of safeguarding and promoting those rights. Preventing any violations in this area is therefore a priority for Libyas interim Government. That is why our Government, in coordination with the General National Congress, has taken a number of steps to that end. They include amending or repealing legislation that is inconsistent with the international obligations of the Libyan State in the field of human rights, as well as setting in motion a process of constitutional review of legislation that runs counter to the provisions of the Constitutional Declaration. We are also taking steps to ratify or accede to certain international human rights conventions, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. Preparations are under way to accede to other international agreements, such as the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. A further step includes developing a practical mechanism for the implementation Human Rights Council decision , in order to provide technical assistance and capacity-building to Libya through direct cooperation between the Libyan Government and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, with the assistance of UNSMIL. We are also establishing a ministerial committee to follow up on the situation of human rights in Libya, headed by the Minister of Justice and including the deputy ministers of the interior, defence and culture, as well as representatives of civil society. We are making every effort to prepare for the visit to Libya by High Commissioner Navi Pillay before the end of this year. We hope that the visit will reinforce the relationship between Libya and the Office of the High Commissioner, in the mutual interests of both.Libya contributes very seriously to the international efforts to eliminate weapons of mass destruction and safeguard international peace and security, and we cooperate fully with international institutions and organizations in this field. We reiterate the call to conclude an unconditional and legally binding instrument to protect non-nuclear States from the threat or use of nuclear weapons, pursuant to the relevant and curb the phenomenon of illegal migration, ensure respect for the sovereignty of States, promote and ensure the rights and dignity of the illegal migrants themselves and enhance cooperation with international organizations.I would be remiss if I failed to express my sincere gratitude to the International Organization for Migration for its cooperation with the relevant international institutions. I also wish to thank the European Union for its assistance to Libya in curbing the problem of illegal migration through its assistance to Libyan institutions in securing the vast borders.Libya faces a number of security threats, including the illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, illegal migration and arms smuggling. That is why we hosted a regional ministerial conference on border security in March 2012, which included the adoption of the Tripoli action plan for border cooperation and the establishment of mechanisms and structures for cooperation and the sharing of information and experience in the field of border protection and control.In addition, last spring, the Libyan city of Ghadames hosted a meeting of the Heads of Government of Libya, Algeria and Tunisia to strengthen joint security operations in addressing the challenges posed by developments in the Sahel and Sahara regions.We also contributed to the ministerial conference on support to Libya in the areas of security, justice and the rule of law, which was held in Paris in February at the initiative of the Libyan interim Government and with the support of the French and British Governments. Two action plans were adopted at that meeting on the development of the Libyan security and justice sectors.The interim Government is sparing no efforts in reactivating the role of the Arab Maghreb group to promote political, development and security cooperation and to promote the interests of all countries in North Africa and the Arab Maghreb. Libya is taking all the necessary steps to get back on the path to development and to complete national projects in all sectors, which requires substantial funds. It is crucial that we recover the looted funds that were smuggled out of Libya. From this rostrum, I reiterate the call that we made to all States to cooperate with and help us locate and recover those funds.We also emphasize our request to the countries in which there are Libyan investments to ensure the right of the Libyan State to those investments and to prevent The tragic developments taking place in Syria make it incumbent upon the international community to put an end to that human tragedy and stop the bloodshed and destruction. We therefore call upon the Security Council to act in accordance with the concept of the responsibility to protect in order to find a solution to the problem, through consensus among its members, so as to save the Syrian people from the daily massacres and help them to achieve their legitimate demands.Libya once again calls upon the international community and human rights institutions to put an end to the human tragedy being experienced by the Muslim Rohingya minority in Myanmar and to accelerate the setting up of an international investigation committee to bring those responsible for the tragedy before international justice, ensure the return of the displaced to their homes and provide compensation to the victims.A revolution took place in Libya to put an end to despotism and dictatorship, a revolution that was the result of deep and long suffering. I assure the Assembly that, with the will of the people who brought about that revolution, our Government will build State institutions, uphold the rule of law, protect its borders, fulfil its promises, honour its obligations towards neighbouring countries and work for the promotion of peace and security. The revolution will achieve peace and security. I wish the Assembly every success at this session."}}
