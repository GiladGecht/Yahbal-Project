{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, let me convey the sincere condolences of the people and the Government of Liechtenstein to all those affected by the abhorrent terrorist attack in Kenya. Our thoughts are with the victims and their families.For the second year in a row, the Assembly is meeting under the shadow of the crisis in Syria. It is the challenge of our time. No other situation in the recent past has so dramatically tested the United Nations ability to respond. And none has so starkly illustrated the limitations and the weaknesses of our multilateral system. Thousands of people have been killed in a brutal war, many of them women and children, and many of them victims of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Regional stability has been eroded. Millions of people are depending on humanitarian assistance, which is often impossible to deliver. Humanitarian access to those most in need, including the sick and the wounded, is being systematically denied owing to cynical political calculations. The humanitarian agencies have become a pawn in that perverted game.Sadly, it took a particularly outrageous act to generate action in the Security Council: the use of chemical weapons, with hundreds of victims, including countless children. We are encouraged to see that the Council has decided to ensure the destruction of all chemical weapons in Syria. That should also provide new momentum to ensure that all remaining States join the Chemical Weapons Convention. Indeed, it should be a step towards the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction worldwide.The use of chemical weapons in Syria has marked a watershed in the conflict. Nevertheless, that issue must not divert our attention away from the core problem: the fighting in Syria continues unabated, with blatant disregard for the civilian population and international humanitarian law. Weapons and ammunition cross the borders more easily than humanitarian assistance.The recent breakthrough on the issue of chemical weapons shows that political progress is possible. endeavours of the Secretary-General and his personal envoy in their search for a definitive, lasting, fair and comprehensive solution that is acceptable to both parties. Such a solution would bolster peace and security in the region and facilitate the building of a prosperous Arab Maghreb that is in step with the legitimate aspirations of its people.The Arab-Israeli conflict is considered a source of hostility and a threat to peace and security in a vital and critical region of the world. It remains so in spite of the legal framework and general conditions for the settlement of that dispute that have been established over the years by a series of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. Those foundations were recently further backed by the Arab Peace Initiative based on the land-for-peace principle. In spite of all of that, the conflict continues, as it has done for too long.We welcome resolution , of 29 November 2012, whereby the General Assembly granted Palestine the status of non-Member observer State in the United Nations. We hope that that resolution will mark the beginning of a new era that will see justice done for the Palestinian people and their rights restored through the establishment of their independent and sovereign Sate along the 4 June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. That would put an end to the suffering of the Palestinian people, which dates back to the inception of our Organization.Based on the need to ensure justice, credibility and equity in the relations between the two parties to that conflict, and out of respect for the relevant resolutions and decisions under international law, the international community should live up to its historic responsibilities with regard to Palestine. We reiterate our condemnation of the ongoing blockade against the Gaza Strip, and we condemn the massacres perpetrated by the Israeli war machine against Palestinian civilians and the destruction of their facilities. We welcome efforts, most recently by the United States Administration, seeking the resumption of negotiations between the two parties. We hope that those efforts will contribute to the realization of the Palestinian peoples simplest right: the establishment of their independent State.The commitments made by the international community through the United Nations will go unrealized if the people of the world are unable to fulfil their potential for development, especially in developing countries, to live lives of dignity and freedom, and to positions. It is therefore implementing its mandate and not politicizing the work it does.Recent events in Syria have reminded us of the importance of the amendments to the Rome Statute adopted in Kampala in 2010. We added provisions that criminalize the use of poisonous and other gases, whether they are used in international or in internal armed conflict. It is troubling that those provisions have become relevant so quickly. But the biggest steps forward are amendments to crimes of aggression. They complement the prohibition of the illegal use of force enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The most serious forms of the illegal use of force by one State against another will become a punishable offence before the ICC. The Court will thereby help enforce the core principle of the rule of law at the international level. With ratifications by Andorra, Cyprus, Slovenia and Uruguay earlier this week, we have come a significant step closer to our common goal, namely, the activation of the Courts policy over crimes of aggression in 2017. Liechtenstein was the first country to ratify the amendments, and we will continue to assist in the ratification process.Liechtenstein firmly believes in the responsibility to protect populations from crimes of atrocity. Clearly, we have much work left to do in order to put that norm into practice. Our inability to respond to the crisis in Syria demonstrates a crucial weakness in the system: the use of the veto, or its threat, in a manner incompatible with the purposes of the United Nations. That can make the Security Council irrelevant when it is most urgently needed. During this general debate, the President of France suggested a common code of conduct for Permanent Members of the Security Council (see ). We strongly agree with that proposal. All five permanent members should be able to give the world one public commitment, that is, that they will not use their veto to block action aimed at ending or preventing crimes of atrocity. That would be crucial to enhancing the Councils effectiveness and credibility. Unfortunately, we have not yet reached the point where we are able to bring the composition of the Security Council in line with the geopolitical realities of the twenty-first century. But the Council is also struggling to adjust its working methods to new challenges in order to better include the perspective of non-members in its decisions, which is a crucial ingredient for effective leadership. We will therefore continue our efforts to Hopefully, that will create the momentum for the Council to finally live up to its responsibility: to end the supply of weapons, pressure the parties to the conflict to accept a ceasefire, work towards a political solution and prepare the ground for accountability for past crimes. There may be different views on who used chemical weapons in Syria, but everyone agrees that that use constitutes a crime against humanity and a war crime that must not go unpunished. It must therefore be put before a court of law, together with the countless other crimes committed, for an independent and impartial investigation.Syria is our biggest collective failure with regard to accountability in recent history. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has been operational for more than a decade now. During that time, we have not witnessed any other situation in which crimes have been committed so systematically, on such a scale and for such a long time without any adequate response from the international community.It is well documented that crimes have been and continue to be committed by all sides. That is precisely the type of crisis for which we established the ICC, and it is precisely the type of situation that led us to give the Security Council the competence to refer situations to the Court. In its recent resolution 2118 (2013), the Council made a limited statement on accountability. More determined and more concrete action must follow. A referral to the ICC will ultimately also contribute to a viable political future for the country, create accountability for those crimes, provide redress for the victims and establish the truth.The establishment of the International Criminal Court has been the most significant development in international law for decades. Only the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty earlier this year has come even close in terms of significance. With 122 States parties, the Court has attracted a strong following. But the emergence of an effective international judicial mechanism also poses challenges. We have mandated the Court to investigate and prosecute the most serious crimes under international law. And we have asked it to focus on those perpetrators who bear the greatest responsibility. Therefore, it cannot be surprising to anyone that the Court is dealing with individuals in leadership positions. We are satisfied that the Court follows the evidence, and that it does not shy away from investigating and prosecuting those in powerful of global impact and for setting standards that apply to all. This is our General Assembly. Let us use it."}}
