{"speech":{"0":" At the very outset, allow me to congratulate Mr. Ashe on his well-deserved election to the office of the President of the General Assembly. I assure him of my delegations full support and cooperation during his tenure of office. I also wish to commend his predecessor for the exemplary leadership he demonstrated during the previous session. From the humble beginnings of a f ledging organization more than six decades ago to a massive expansion in membership today, the United Nations has undoubtedly stood the test of time. Its worth as an indispensable entity in shaping the world of our time is a matter of common cause. Some of the great strides the United Nations has made span the peaceful settlement of disputes, restoring calm in many countries through peacekeeping, raising awareness of human rights and eradicating diseases. Nevertheless, much still needs to be done.Much of the world remains mired in poverty and disease, while peace, security and stability continue to be fragile. Economic development continues to be the greatest challenge in our history. As we ushered in a new millennium 13 years ago, we adopted the Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in order to focus the worlds attention on ending extreme poverty in all its forms. The 2015 deadline for the achievement of the MDGs is fast approaching, yet it A decade has passed since the initiation of the notion of the responsibility to protect. Yet, the operationalization of that concept has not become a reality. The fact that crimes of mass atrocity continue to be committed around the world is a stark reminder that the time for a collective approach to protecting populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity is now. Most mass atrocities often do not occur spontaneously, but rather as part of a planned process. Over the years, we have learned the important lesson that the Organization cannot stand on the sidelines when challenged to take preventive action. In so doing, we should guard against the misuse and abuse of the norm of the responsibility to protect by infringing on the national sovereignty or altering the legal obligation of Member States to refrain from the use of force except in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations.From the Horn of Africa and across the Sahel region to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the African continent is facing a rise in lawlessness and conflicts. As we celebrate the jubilee of the formation of our continental organization, the Organization of African Unity, we are resolved, as leaders of Africa, that Africa must open a new chapter going forward and extricate itself from the conflicts that have so soiled its reputation and compromised its development. We are determined to build a safe, secure and peaceful Africa from here forward.With the presence of extremist groups and terrorist entities in the Middle East and elsewhere, terrorism continues to pose a serious threat to world peace, security and development. The ugly face of that scourge has once again resurfaced in Kenya. We condemn the barbaric killings of innocent people in the Westgate mall in Nairobi, committed by Al-Shabaab. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families that have lost their loved ones. We all know that solutions to these problems cannot be through military means alone. We have to invest more in creating a holistic and integrated approach that targets, among other things, the improvement of economic development, the promotion of the rule of law, the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and good governance.In the face of the numerous global challenges existing in the world today, promoting more effective global governance should be at the forefront of the international agenda. We, the membership of the United Nations, should strive for an international Organization mountain ecosystems should be at the forefront of our plans.The state of peace and security in the world is gradually getting worse. The possession of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction remains the principal threat to the survival of humankind. The widespread sectarian strife in the Middle East and elsewhere and xenophobia are some of the great challenges to global peace. Sadly, discord remains among Member States on how to overcome those problems.Of particular concern to my delegation is the situation in Syria, which poses a serious and growing threat to international peace and security. Scores of civilians continue to be the principal victims. Women, children and the elderly are bearing the brunt of the conflict. The use of chemical weapons in Syria is not only abhorrent, but also a crime against humanity. We condemn it in the strongest terms, as it threatens to undermine the norm against the use of chemical weapons universally embraced by the international community. We welcome the partial report of the United Nations chemical weapons inspectors investigating the use of those weapons in Syria, and hope that the culprits will face the might of international law and justice.The crisis in Syria has the potential to engulf the whole Middle East region, with global ramifications. We call on the international community to find a quick and lasting solution to the conflict. Whether in Syria or anywhere else, perpetrators of crimes against humanity must be held legally accountable for their actions.History has revealed that human societies can enjoy peaceful, orderly progress only if the rule of law obtains. The conviction that peace and justice are inextricably intertwined has always underpinned the efforts of the United Nations in the area of the maintenance of international peace and security. Indeed, the International Criminal Court (ICC), created in 1998, is a beacon that speaks to that truism. We must use institutions, such as the ICC and other international legal tribunals, as a reflection of the international communitys increasing rejection of impunity and evidence that there is a rising tide in favour of the rule of law. At the same time, we need to ensure that institutions, such as the ICC, are adequately insulated against politicization. Selective prosecutions must be avoided. mirror reflecting a divided and troubled world. Rather, they yearn for progress and solutions to the problems besieging their world. They want ideas, leadership and concrete hope for the future. Our actions and decisions should embody themes of peace and development that look far beyond the immediacy of the moment. The challenges that confront us today must be, more than ever before, addressed with the candour and decision that the present global economic and political situation dictates to us all."}}
