{"speech":{"0":" There are two years left until the deadline for achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. It is therefore time to review what we have succeeded in achieving and set the guidelines for the work that remains.Development is a global challenge. Every contribution that is made, every experience that we share and every lesson that we have learned is very important for all of us. By sharing we set the stage for learning from each other — and not only from our own mistakes. In todays world, every country has the right to choose a path that best suits its experience, culture and needs, as long as it does not infringe upon the rights of others and guarantees human rights and freedoms. The international community has an obligation to offer support based on the principles of ownership and empowerment so that those choices may be realized.Development cannot be imposed; it must be promoted. But it is not only about development. It is about free choice, democracy and fundamental rights, each of which is key to the success of the Millennium Development Goals and the post-2015 development agenda. Today we live in the twenty-first century, but there are still those who want to enforce a specific course of development on others, using economic pressure, energy levers or cybertools, by distorted information or threats. It is true that internationally approved guide our deliberations on the many challenges that the world faces today. Also, allow me to commend His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremic for his excellent leadership during the sixty-seventh session.The President knows better than most the unique combination of challenges faced by small island developing States. We are being battered from all sides, both literally and figuratively. Over the past decade, we have faced a f lood of crises with a genesis far from our shores that have stretched our capacity to protect and improve the health and prosperity of our people.The near collapse of the global financial system and spikes in food and energy prices have caused enormous difficulties for our small and vulnerable economy. A severe drought caused additional hardship and foreshadowed the much more difficult future we will face in a warming world. At the same time, the f low of official development assistance and climate financing have begun to stagnate.Thankfully, we are presented with an unprecedented opportunity over the next few years to transform how the international system supports sustainable development. We will be continuing work on a number of important processes over the next year., They include the crafting of sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda, the work of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development and — of particular importance to my country — the proceedings of the third Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. In addition, we must make rapid progress towards a new climate-change agreement in 2015, which will obviously have enormous implications for the sustainable development prospects of small islands. We must work in a coordinated fashion so that those processes are mutually reinforcing and deliver concrete results, rather than produce the usual rhetoric. It will be a challenge, but under the Presidents skilled leadership, I am confident we can succeed.However, I fear we will come up short of our ambitions for transformational change if we shy away from making fundamental reforms in the way the global economy works. We began a promising conversation on the matter back in 2008 when the financial crisis was still fresh in our minds, but as stock prices have rebounded, our attention has wandered. Let us not forget that most of the problems that caused the previous crisis have not been fixed. Those same problems also manipulation of energy prices, the use of pressure and open disrespect displayed in information forums.The countries of the European Union Eastern Partnership are not the only ones experiencing such problems. Even Lithuania, which holds the presidency of the Council of the European Union and has successfully consolidated its course of development, is under similar pressure. Barriers to travel, unreasonable delays in cargo transportation, the milk wars — those are just a few very recent controversial examples. For nations, the decision is really difficult to make when free choice means being threatened with gas-price increases and blocked trade, instead of receiving support and advice. Under such pressure, it is hard to implement reforms that empower members of society and open up opportunities to engage in the state-building process.The post-2015 development agenda must provide instruments that empower States to seek development, based on free will and their individual needs. There is no place for forced choices, open threats or demonstrations of power. The international community, especially the United Nations, should empower States to realize such self-determination. I urge us all to give the matter our very careful attention."}}
