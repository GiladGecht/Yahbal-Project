{"speech":{"0":" The President of the General Assembly has chosen for this session and this general debate the theme “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. He has thus called on the Assembly to be bold and ambitious, to work together towards the same objective, to prove to the world that we will not accept defeat, and to exert our collective responsibility in order to eradicate poverty and promote sustainable development.Luxembourg stands ready to do so. We are ready to work towards a renewed global partnership based on a common understanding of our shared humanity, on a new spirit of solidarity, cooperation and mutual accountability, and on coordinated action that embraces security, development, governance, human rights and the rule of law.To live free from fear, conflict and violence is the most fundamental human right, and yet we witness unspeakable violations of human rights and international humanitarian law every single day. The use of missiles, bombs, cluster munitions and chemical weapons, the systematic imposition of sieges, forced displacements, torture, sexual violence, violations and abuses committed against children, more than 2 million refugees, more than 100,000 dead — these are the chilling results of two and a half years of brutal repression and conflict in Syria. The list of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed on a daily basis continues to grow. Against such horror, I repeat once again that the situation in Syria must be referred to the International Criminal Court. Allow me to quote High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres: “Syria has become the great tragedy of this century — a disgraceful humanitarian calamity with suffering and displacement unparalleled in recent history”. The Syrian people need assistance now, and they have the right to such assistance under the most basic criteria codified in international humanitarian law. The Syrian authorities must urgently meet the demands of development actors. I would like to support the single overarching post-2015 framework, which will link poverty eradication in all its dimensions and the promotion of sustainable development. I therefore call for the full integration of all relevant international processes, which have been separate until now, in particular the review of the MDGs and the work of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals.We have to make sure that the future goals will be universal for all countries but at the same time remain realistic, taking into account the actual possibilities of each country. They must be achievable and measurable. I appreciate the fact that the report of the High-level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda puts emphasis on inclusive growth and considers the role of innovation, technology and the private sector actors. The proposed development goal to secure sustainable energy is a very good example and should figure among the future development priorities.In December, the international community will commemorate the sixty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The situation of human rights has improved in some areas. New human rights challenges have emerged. A great deal of work still lies ahead of us. The Czech Republic, a member of the Human Rights Council and the country of Vaclav Havel, will always defend human rights wherever they are violated.In conclusion, I should like to focus on issues related to the process of reforming the United Nations. The Czech Republic appreciates the dedicated work of the Secretary-General, which is transforming the United Nations into a more effective and accountable system. Unfortunately, there are not enough means to fund all initiatives. We all have to do more with less. I am sure that we will find internal reserves that will allow the United Nations to achieve the tasks entrusted to it with greater success. By performing well and by being responsive to its Member States, the United Nations will strengthen the political will of its Members to invest in multilateral forums and thus contribute to a safer world."}}
