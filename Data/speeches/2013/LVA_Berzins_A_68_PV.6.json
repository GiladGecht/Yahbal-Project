{"speech":{"0":" The three pillars of the United Nations — peace and security, sustainable development, and human rights — are interlinked and mutually reinforcing. Respect for universal human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law is a cornerstone of international peace and stability.Fragile, conflict-affected and least developed countries face the biggest difficulties in ensuring sustainable development. Growing evidence shows that progress on the Millenium Development Goals in those States is impossible without first achieving peace and security. That leads us to one of the cornerstones of the new post-2015 vision: peace and security are basic conditions for a decent life and for the enjoyment of human rights.The priorities of the Assemblys sixty-eighth session are topical and very pertinent. The new development framework for post-2015 will remain high on the United Nations agenda for the next two years and beyond. It should set out a comprehensive and coherent framework around a single set of global goals, driving action in all countries. A set of peacebuilding goals should be high on the post-2015 agenda, in which the United Nations should continue to play the leading role in promoting the settlement of disputes by peaceful means.The Middle East stands at a crossroads. Events there have global impact, and the international community must take decisive actions. Latvia counts on the support of Member States and gives its assurance that it will contribute to the work of those bodies in a responsible manner."}}
