{"speech":{"0":" It is often said that things always come in threes. Indeed, this is It is also important to remember other parallel truths that are often overlooked or hidden. Because we acted in solidarity by welcoming Rwandan refugees to our territory, the Congolese population in the eastern part of the country has been deprived of peace — a fundamental right of all persons — and they continue to count their dead. The most recent episode of the unending tragedy occurred when bombs crushed the women and children of Goma last July. It was truly a tragedy unequalled in history and which cannot leave any heart untouched. It is time to ask ourselves what will remain of international humanitarian law if welcoming refugees in distress, which is a humanitarian act par excellence, becomes sufficient reason to justify the eruption of war. The recent bombing of Goma was all the more reprehensible as it was perpetrated while the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo was in the process of implementing the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework of Addis Ababa, including talks with the armed group responsible for the bombings. Nevertheless, I wish to reaffirm my countrys determination to comply with all of the commitments contained in the Framework agreement. From that perspective, my Government has already undertaken the following definitive actions: the establishment of the National Follow-up Mechanism to implement the commitments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo; the acceleration of security sector reform, especially the army, police and justice sectors; further progress in decentralization, by adopting the necessary implementation laws; the reform of public finance management; and the restructuring of the Independent National Election Commission. This last was immediately implemented in order to prioritize the organization of local, municipal, provincial, senatorial and provincial governor elections. A national dialogue has been organized, starting on 7 September, with the goal of seeking national cohesion to better respond to all of the challenges facing the country.Beyond those efforts on the part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the dawn of sustainable peace in the region depends on two main conditions — ending impunity in all its aspects, and the diligent execution of their commitments by the other signatories of the Framework agreement. Therefore, my country again urgently appeals to the Organization to deal with all Member States with equal rigour and to require that each one strictly respect the principles of the Charter of Madagascar is finding it difficult to attain all the Millennium Development Goals, despite the efforts everyone has made. Given that situation, I have to wonder what sort of contribution we, the leaders of our nations, can make individually to that collective effort, with a view to finding ways of improving the daily lives of those who have put their trust in us and placed their destiny in our hands.In his statement yesterday (see ), Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stressed the fact that, in streets and squares across the world, people are pressing those in power. They want world leaders to listen. They want to know that we are doing everything we can to secure a life of dignity for all. The popular unrest in the context of the Arab Spring and the movements of the outraged exemplify this observation and reflect a legitimate aspiration. I fully support the Secretary-Generals remarks and call upon all of us to ensure that we clearly understand the demands of the demonstrators. Madagascar would also have wished to benefit from such understanding when the Malagasy people rose up against an unpopular regime to demand a better life through the establishment of genuine change. But that was not the case. On the contrary, Madagascar encountered misunderstanding and the inflexibility of an international community operating at various speeds, not to mention the application of dogmatic texts, even though popular uprisings elsewhere, in very similar circumstances, had been viewed sympathetically and with concern.Efforts must therefore now be made to end the unequal treatment of countries in crisis. We must become aware of popular aspirations and realities on the ground so as not to take the wrong decision. If it is valid elsewhere, surely it is also valid in the case of Madagascar? All the conditions were in place in Madagascar. The danger of a social explosion and a fratricidal conflict was omnipresent, but fortunately — unlike some countries that continue to experience unrest and even armed violence, and despite all the economic and social restrictions and the absence of support and assistance from the international community from which Madagascar has suffered in recent years — the people of Madagascar did not fall into the trap of internal conflict, which some would have taken advantage of.the third time that I have had the privilege to address the Assembly as President of the Transition of the Republic of Madagascar. Here we are again, convening as we do every year for the General Assembly. All the leaders of the planet meet regularly to debate, exchange views and share their experiences within the framework of a process of consultations that belongs to a long collective march towards peace, security and sustainable planetary development. But each year, new, ever more violent and more lethal conflicts are waged, requiring that we respond with equal intensity. Shall we limit ourselves to simply speaking about conflict resolution, or shall we to challenge ourselves, analyse the underlying causes and take the necessary measures to preserve stability in the world? As I add my voice to those who have spoken before me, I warmly congratulate the President on the votes that he won in support of his candidacy. Madagascar will endeavour to provide him its sincere support and cooperation.Regrettably, over recent decades, when we speak of Africa, we generally see States that are exposed to permanent violence and the progressive loss of democracy, States where wars, conflicts and crises continually break out and there is more division than consensus. According to Ambassador Jeremic, who presided at the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly, humankind is facing an existential crisis, with symptoms such as economic instability, social inequalities and environmental degradation. For my part, I would add that humankind may be losing its forward momentum but that it is not giving up. Yes, the news delivered by the media every day is extremely worrying throughout the world. Whether the country is developed, emerging or poor, no segment of society escapes deterioration of various kinds, including poor employment conditions, unemployment, declining purchasing power, the total absence of any income at all, lack of access to basic necessities in food, clothing, health care and education, and, in addition, poverty, deprivation and indigence. Those are all factors that are the nurturing ground for intolerance, confrontation and conflict, thereby helping to give rise to global insecurity. I refer here particularly to recent events in Kenya, Iraq, Pakistan and Syria, to name just a few. We fully share in the pain and sorrow of the families of the victims. Some 800 days from the deadline of 2015, like most African States and many developing countries, In my case, I did everything I could to overcome the political crisis in Madagascar and maintain national unity and the best interests of the Malagasy people. I also decided that I will not be a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections. It is on that note, and with the well-known words of American theologian and writer James Freeman Clarke, that I would like to conclude: “A politician thinks of the next election. A statesman, of the next generation.”"}}
