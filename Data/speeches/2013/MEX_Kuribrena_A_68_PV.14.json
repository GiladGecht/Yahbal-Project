{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of President Enrique Pena Nieto, it is an honour for me to address the plenary of this Organization, a symbol of universal values and of the best causes of humankind. On behalf of the people and Government of Mexico, I thank the international community for the generous expressions of solidarity and support following the weather-related events in my country. They contribute to the work of the Government and to the fraternal participation of civil society in providing assistance to those affected. Over the past two weeks, Mexico has suffered the unprecedented simultaneous arrival of two hurricanes, Ingrid and Manuel, one on the Pacific coast and the other on the Atlantic coast. Over the past few decades, Mexico has worked hard to bolster its capability to protocols of the ICGLR, as well as statements and decisions made by Heads of State and Government of member States in Addis Abeba and Kampala. At the regional level, we reaffirm our commitment, under the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region, signed in Addis Ababa on 24 February. With regard to the very unstable situation in the Central African Republic, Burundi, as a member of the Economic Community of Central African States, is ready to work with other nations to deploy a military contingent there in order to participate in re-establishing peace. Concerning the situation in Egypt, Burundi hopes that the Egyptian people find a swift way out of the crisis. With our African Union and United Nations partners, we are prepared to ensure that the Arab Republic of Egypt and its people revive their democratic institutions. With regard to Syria, Burundi believes that the international community must do all it can to help all parties reach a ceasefire in order to settle their differences peaceably. With regard to the conflict in the Middle East, Burundi reiterates its support for a negotiated solution that leads to two States living side by side in peace and mutual respect, in line with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. Terrorism in its various forms has become a source of daily concern. Not even a week goes by without an act of terrorism being carried out somewhere in the world. Barbaric acts strike indiscriminately, affecting innocent people who have had the misfortune of finding themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. The Government of Burundi would like to take this opportunity to condemn, in the firmest way possible, the cowardly and arbitrary terrorist attack at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi. That heinous act has plunged into mourning not only Kenya, but the entire international community, given the different nationalities of the victims. We would like to convey to our brothers the people of Kenya and to their Government our sincere condolences and to reassure them of our friendship and solidarity. Burundi reiterates its full support for the United Nations Global Counter-terrorism Strategy, adopted by Member States in 2006. Nayarit, on Mexicos Pacific coast, we will host the second Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons.Human security is also affected by the irresponsible use of, and illicit trafficking in, conventional weapons. Mexico therefore welcomes the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty. Demonstrating great vision, the Mexican Senate has approved the Treaty, and I deposited our instrument of ratification yesterday. We will comply with it immediately, even before its entry into force worldwide. Mexico calls on all States to ratify the Treaty, which is a testament to the Organizations ability to achieve common solutions to shared challenges. I also hope that the United Nations will show the same willingness to take on the fight against sexual violence as a weapon in conflict situations.Mexico is also acting responsibly in dealing with the global drug problem. Like Chile, Colombia and others, Mexico believes we should evaluate internationally agreed policies in the search for more effective responses based on a focus on health and a framework of respect for human rights and from a perspective of damage control. The goal must be the well-being of society in all its aspects. Along with Costa Rica, Paraguay and others, we believe we should give priority to prevention so as to reduce the impact on health and, in particular, the violence associated with drug problems. Similarly, it would be helpful to strengthen international cooperation so as to reduce the illegal f lows of arms and money that fuel criminal networks. Along with Guatemala and others, we believe the new global strategy should be based on an open and inclusive debate leading up to the special session of the General Assembly scheduled for 2016. We welcome the Antigua Declaration issued at the General Assembly of the Organization of American States as a first step in the right direction towards the 2016 special session.The fight against organized crime must always respect the rule of law and human rights. When there is a risk or merely a possibility that the right to privacy of any citizen might be infringed by any Government, we have demanded that it be investigated and the parties responsible held accountable. In Mexico, the protection of personal data is a human right guaranteed by the Constitution.Mexico believes firmly in free trade and in building mechanisms that promote the free circulation prevent and respond to natural disasters. However, the increased vulnerability we face in the world underscores the need and urgency for action. That is why we welcome the Secretary-Generals decision to convene a summit in September 2014 to address the impact of climate change. Mexico will participate enthusiastically and will continue to contribute to the implementation of the agreements reached in 2010 at Cancun. I join in the international communitys unanimous condemnation of the unspeakable attacks against civilians in Nairobi. Mexico expresses its solidarity to the Government and people of Kenya, as well as our condolences to relatives of the victims. Such unfortunate acts constitute an affront to peace and clearly demonstrate the need for us to remain vigilant in the fight against terrorism. We also join those who have expressed their condolences to the Government and people of Pakistan following the recent earthquake.My countrty believes in multilateralism and reiterates its unflinching commitment to the Organization. We support the diplomatic initiatives aimed at finding a peaceful political solution to the crisis in Syria, in particular the agreement reached by the United States and Russia on eliminating chemical weapons in that country. The prohibition of the use or threat of use of chemical weapons is absolute. The events of 21 August outside Damascus are unacceptable. The dismantling and destruction of the Syrian arsenals, under the auspices of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the Security Council, must be immediate and unconditional. There can be no room for dilatory tactics or blackmail. Mexico supports the convening of the “Geneva II” international conference on Syria as soon as possible, with the goal of achieving lasting peace there.The challenges we face today compel us to seek a Security Council that is truly representative of the international community, without positions of privilege reserved for a few; a Council that is transparent and accountable; and a Council that acknowledges that a veto does not work in situations involving genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.Mexico believes that disarmament should continue to be one of the key goals of the United Nations. In keeping with my countrys longstanding contributions to the cause of disarmament, in February 2014 in Indigenous Peoples,to be held in 2014, for which great event we will host a preparatory meeting.Our experience shows that to achieve the goal of inclusion, we must consider every dimension of poverty — lack of income and financial inclusion, nutrition, health, education, housing and basic services. Both through our national crusade against hunger and as a member of the Group of 20, Mexico has sought to place such deficiencies at the centre of the debate. The innovative feature of our national crusade against hunger lies in its focus on a multidimensional measurement of poverty and in the fact that it seeks to overcome the deficiencies thus measured in order to arrive at sustainable and structural ways of mitigating the conditions that lead to hunger.In the spirit of moving Mexico forward, we are undertaking transformative reforms for increasing access to quality education, telecommunication, the financial system and social security. Strengthening international support will be crucial to implementing the post-2015 development agenda. We must meet the international commitments on financing for development agreed on under the Monterrey Consensus and achieve coordinated, transparent cooperation with clear goals. That is why Mexico will host the first High-level Meeting of the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation next year. Central to the agenda for that forum will be the mobilization of domestic resources for development. Mexico therefore agrees with all measures that help prevent the erosion of our tax base and its migration to jurisdictions with low or no taxes.Today the world is coming closer together, because we have a greater global awareness. We are all affected by the suffering and challenges of other nations, wherever we are. Let us capitalize on that awareness in order to include those who are excluded and to extend a hand to those who have not had our opportunities. Let us do what is necessary to make our world a place where greater equality is a reality. President Enrique Pena Nieto wishes to leave no doubt as to his and Mexicos commitment to a peaceful world, a world in which the best causes of humankind make headway, an inclusive world in which inequalities are reduced and extreme poverty is eradicated and a world in which economic growth produces prosperity for all. From this rostrum, Mexico declares its firmly held belief in its global responsibilities. of people, goods and capital. That is why we and Chile, Colombia and Peru formed the Pacific Alliance, which is organized in a spirit of openness and plurality, as the heterogeneity of its members with observer status reflects. Our only goal is for the Pacific Alliance to be an inclusive, useful tool for the promotion of prosperity for the citizens of our nations. That is also the spirit behind our work this year in the Association of Caribbean States.During this session of the Assembly we will begin the process of evaluating our achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and outlining a road map for the post-2015 agenda. The success of the Millennium Development Goals is rooted in focusing the actions of the international community on clear and ambitious targets. Despite that, it is important to acknowledge that painful inequality and a lack of participation and access to development still persist among the most vulnerable groups in highly industrialized countries, as well as developing ones. Poverty, inequality and social exclusion exacerbate conflicts and help to undermine the rule of law. The development agenda must be based on a commitment to inclusion. Policies that bring together mechanisms promoting development and openness to innovation, coupled with political determination on the part of the international community, will enable us to advance towards a world with opportunities for all.Inclusion should be a central premise in the negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda, thus ensuring not only a narrowing of the poverty and inequality gaps but also active participation by societys most vulnerable groups. That is why we will convene a meeting in Mexico to promote a global perspective on inclusion, in which Governments, civil society and United Nations agencies, funds and programmes will participate with the aim of defining the parameters of inclusion and its impact on development policies, so we can establish minimum thresholds for inclusion to which every human being is entitled. In that context, we acknowledge the high-level events being held within the framework of this session of the General Assembly — on persons with disabilities and on international migration and development. Full observance of the rights of such groups is an essential component of the post-2015 development agenda.Mexico is a multi-ethnic and multicultural nation that is proud of its 68 indigenous peoples. That is why we attach such importance to the World Conference on the international community will enable significant improvement in the performance of least developed countries. Benin has taken that opportunity to develop a road map that includes a stopwatch for the last 1,000 days in order to speed up the achievement of the Goals by 2015. My country is one of 16 African countries deemed able to achieve at least five of the eight MDGs by that date. I would like to commend the leadership of the United Nations and its relevant bodies, as well as other partner agencies, in mobilizing energies to assist States in achieving the Goals. It is important to fully include in the post-2015 development agenda those MDGs that have not been achieved on time and give them top priority in order to ensure there is continuity with the new normative framework established by the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development held in Rio de Janeiro and the demands that will result from the goals currently being developed. In that regard, the main theme for the general debate of the sixty-eighth session — “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” — is quite timely and perfectly in line with the consultations that have taken place at various levels to develop that agenda.Thanks to the meticulous clarification of issues and challenges by the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, appointed by the Secretary General to present recommendations to him, we have a galvanizing vision and appropriate materials to build a unique, coherent programme regarding all those points, and pragmatic enough to ensure that everybody on the planet is placed on a sustainable development path so everyone can have access to shared a prosperity that leaves no country or person aside.The post-2015 development agenda must be universal in nature. It must also be broken down into specific measures targeting reforms and corrective measures needed to re-establish any balances that have been upset or threatened. From that standpoint, it is of crucial importance that the situations of greatest current concern to the international community should enjoy particular attention, as stipulated in principle 6 of the 1992 Rio Declaration. We should therefore strongly support what is stated in the Secretary-Generals report entitled “A life of dignity for all” (), that the needs of the least developed and most vulnerable countries should form the basis for defining the goals of the programme."}}
