{"speech":{"0":" It is my honour to convey to the Assembly the warm greeting of “Yokwe” from the Government and people of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.Every September, world leaders take to the stage of the General Assembly to broadcast our common concerns. But I am concerned that this poetic ritual too often hides the problem of political will. In January, the Secretary-General outlined two key political priorities for leaders: addressing climate change risks and the strategic importance of the EUs enlargement policy. It must be continued with respect to all countries of the Western Balkans — based on their individual merits — as it is the best option for long-term stability in the region. We strongly support all of the countries in our neighbourhood in their endeavours and believe that their efforts towards future membership of the European Union will be successful.It is important to understand that reconciliation and cooperation have become a new standard for regional policies, and in that regard, we welcome closer collaboration among all countries of South-Eastern Europe, both bilaterally and in the framework of regional organizations and initiatives.Before concluding, I would like to address the issue of United Nations reform. We believe that there is a need for true reform of the current United Nations structures and mechanisms if the United Nations is to achieve its ambitious goals and strengthen its capacity to meet new challenges.The first area is Security Council reform. Croatia commends the persevering commitment of Member States to the ongoing negotiating process and believes that broader understanding of sustainability should find its place in that context as well. However, any reform of the Council must not have a negative impact on its ability to perform its main duties and meet its primary responsibilities. Enlargement of the Council is closely connected with the reform of its working methods, while the continuing veto powers of the permanent five continues to raise numerous questions. That is why such reform must be comprehensive. That having been said, it is Croatias position that any enlargement should take place in both the permanent and the non-permanent categories of membership, with one additional non-permanent seat reserved for the group of Eastern European States. That would more properly reflect the reality of international relations in the twenty-first century.As a member of the Economic and Social Council, we intend to continue advocating a stronger and more efficient role for that main body in its efforts to seek solutions to the most significant social and economic challenges of our time. The General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council should also find ways of working together to support deliberations on the complex matter of sustainable development. Within its broad, overarching mandate, the General Assembly remains the central point for all of our discussions. Our Pacific legacy is not as small island States, but as large ocean nations. We are stewards of what is a truly global resource — our oceans and fisheries. Even a casual glance at a map reveals a world of deep and vast blue, and not only scientists but our own local communities see change in our waters. Local and global ocean impacts affect not only every region, but also global food security. I join with other Pacific leaders in urging dedicated treatment of the oceans as a post-2015 United Nations sustainable development goal.Pacific nations, including the States parties to the Nauru Agreement, are leading the world in changing fishing practice. We are not only leading the world in advancing sustainable fisheries, but at the same time boosting our own economic growth. Perhaps no other effort or region is such a strong textbook example of sustainable development in action. But for all of the expressed plenary sympathies and common international responsibility, existing legal commitments to safeguard fisheries all too often fall victim to the short-term trade interests of our partners. We Pacific leaders will sacrifice neither our resources nor our growth or livelihood for quick returns; our future generations are not for sale. The threat of harmful fisheries sanctions from distant fishing nations — perhaps as punishment for our conservation efforts — is hardly a helping hand either to our regional development or to international food security.Next years international meeting on small island States and development partnerships, to be held in Samoa, will offer our political partners a moment for careful reflection. Is the global thirst for rare earth minerals beneath our waves and is the hunger for our vast fisheries so great as to outstrip our rightful economic development and our conservation efforts? Perhaps it is high time that island leaders set forward our island vision of partnership and collaborate accordingly. We cannot forge progress through political will alone. Here, Pacific Islands Forum leaders have forged a ground-breaking mutual dialogue to enhance and improve effective United Nations partnerships in our region. Those are not isolated words; already, the United Nations, together with our bilateral partners, is playing a valuable role in working with the Marshall Islands to recover from a climate-driven drought and other coastal f looding emergencies.But we need not wait for disasters. In every sector of basic development and environmental efforts, our door is open for increased collaboration among the growing insecurity within Syria. As autumn sets in, it is evident that efforts are falling short. This year, leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum expressed strong concern about the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian Government and called for leadership on the part of the members of the Security Council to resolve that threat. While I am optimistic about recent diplomatic developments, the common international voice may come too little and too late for what could have already been prevented. That is only one example of a growing list of the tragic human costs of inaction. How many more mistakes will the world make in distant conference rooms? For how long can we turn a blind eye to realities and headlines?Pacific nations are now dedicated to changing the pace. This month, Pacific Islands Forum leaders adopted the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership. Although many of our States are small, the common responsibility to act falls on all Governments and persons, no matter how different we are. The Marshall Islands is well on track to achieve the complete solarization of our outer islands — a goal we are meeting with assistance from Japans Pacific Environment Community funds and from the European Union, Taiwan, Italy, France and other donor partners. The entire region is also aggressively cutting its emissions through the Pacific New Energy Drive. The message to our partners, the worlds largest emitters, is clear. If we can do it, they can too. Climate change is a risk that demands direct political ownership, and it is high time that other leaders stand alongside the Pacific in showing the statesmanship so urgently needed. Simply repeating well-worn negotiation slogans has not got the world anywhere. It is time for new solutions. I strongly urge my fellow leaders to engage eye to eye at the Secretary-Generals climate summit next year. Never has the need for true statesmanship been as dire.Global efforts on climate change are falling short, and low-lying island nations, such as mine, are already paying the earliest costs of what is fast becoming a global crisis. In every sense, the world must build for future risks, and we are still setting course based on current conditions, as is often the case. It is the seas that are rising — not the islands that are sinking. I will not concede my own land or my nation; nor will I rest until my fellow world leaders have signed on to act, not just out of economic convenience, but out of a common responsibility of all to strive for upward momentum. of the Republic of the Marshall Islands for the statement he has just made.Mr. Christopher J.
