{"speech":{"0":" I wish to join other delegations at this gathering in congratulating you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I am sure that under your guidance and through your excellent diplomatic skills we will have a rich exchange of ideas and a fruitful outcome. I also wish to extend my congratulations and gratitude to your predecessor, Vuk Jeremic, for his successful stewardship of the previous session of the General Assembly. My deepest appreciation also goes to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, whose passion and commitment have been instrumental in the work of the organization.I will start by taking the Assembly back a few years. All here will certainly remember how not too long ago the world waited in anticipation and hope for the clock to push past midnight to the year 2000. As with most fresh starts, the new millennium brought with it a sense of promise and, indeed, something extraordinary was taking place.For the first time in history, Governments had committed themselves to “walk the talk” by adhering to a set of measurable targets aimed at lifting millions out of poverty by the year 2015. The so-called Millennium Development Goals were bold and ambitious. They became national and global priorities, setting Government policies and generating a strong commitment across wide areas towards their attainment. Failure, it was felt, was not an option.Undoubtedly, there have been remarkable successes. The number of people living in extreme poverty has fallen, as have poverty rates. Access to sources of clean water has improved. The proportion failures. It would be easy to f lip channels once again, to “park it in someone elses back yard”. But it is not someone elses problem. Irregular immigration, human trafficking and modern-day slavery are everyones problem. We all have to play a part in solving it, not only regionally but also globally.There needs to be a sustained evolution in our thinking. At the threshold of the year 2015, we urge fellow nations not only to think beyond the current Millennium Development Goals and how to ensure their sustainability, but also to think of other goals that could be included. There can be no unfinished business. There can be no sustainable development goals without peace, without fighting corruption, without respect for human rights and without economic equality, which is the social justice issue of our time. The news headlines may not shock us anymore, but those living in fear of losing their lives and those of their families do not live in order to make news. They look to survive. Whether scrapping for food or seeking shelter from bullets, whether hiding their daughters to prevent them from falling victim to rape as a tool of war or keeping sons from being forcibly recruited as child soldiers, millions of people all over the world live dreading tomorrow. Each day they die a little bit more.We bear responsibility for not safeguarding their sense of belonging as equal human beings on this planet. Malta firmly believes that the United Nations can and must do more to safeguard human dignity and stir the conscience of humankind. No undertaking can be as fundamental as addressing the needs of the peoples of the world, and no organization is better situated to see that that can be done than the United Nations.Maltas geostrategic location makes it look most closely at that which surrounds it. We are proud to be a people of the sea, of a Mediterranean Sea that has given us life and marked our history. We are proud of our contributions towards the health of that sea, the many exchanges that we support and the good relations we maintain with all our neighbours, North and South. But we are also troubled by the conflicts and suffering that we see around us. Waves of new tomorrows and hopeful struggles for democracy in North Africa have given way to new realities that were unthinkable when the Millennium Development Goals were drawn up. Sectarian strife, religious tensions and power struggles have halted or reversed the progress of development. It is almost correct to say that the responsibilities and obligations in the context of providing overseas development assistance to developing countries. That remains a cornerstone of Maltas international relations, and we remain firmly engaged in seeking the eradication of poverty and the sustainable development of societies in need. We are proud to form part of the European Union, which is the worlds largest donor of development aid, and we are committed to reaching the goals that we have set and to being a reliable partner for those in need.I am equally proud to recall that this year marks the twenty-fifth year since Malta proposed to the General Assembly that climate conservation should be part of humankinds shared concerns, a concept that launched the process leading to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Malta is proud to have been at the forefront of that discussion. We are adamant about keeping the issue alive, for we are conscious of the fact that climate change hits hardest the worlds most vulnerable.In defining a common vision for the future, we believe that the eradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development must be at the heart of the post-2015 development framework. In the words of the former President of South Africa, Mr. Nelson Mandela, “[o]vercoming poverty is not a gesture of charity. It is an act of justice. Like slavery and apartheid, poverty is not natural. It is man-made and it can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings.” Malta is committed to continuing to engage with its international partners in developing a post-2015 global development agenda that delivers on the promise of a better and fairer world for all.Malta also understands the need to act in other very tangible ways. When rickety boats laden with irregular migrants reach our shores, which happens each and every day, we see the suffering, we feel the loss of dignity etched on peoples faces. We understand that they are caught in a web of poverty and criminal exploitation. We feel for those f leeing persecution and poverty. They are desperately searching for safety and prosperity. We do everything we can to provide them with the help they need, offering refuge and respite.Yet Malta cannot do that alone. The international community must do more in the face of an ongoing situation that is nothing but tragic evidence of our global resources and stif les our potential. The United Nations family, committed as it is to the purposes of peace and prosperity among nations, understands that. Malta firmly believes that true peace in our time needs to be the overriding goal, the one target to which we should all aspire and for which we should all work. We need to ensure stable and peaceful societies if we want to take the Millennium Development Goals further. The opportunities for all to thrive are at hand. The United Nations is and should be the force field to which all nations gravitate in order to solve differences and push boundaries together. Our global goals and commitments cannot be solely time-bound but must also be outcome-oriented. We need to think inclusively and holistically. Post-2015, we should not be looking towards rebooting, but towards continuity with greater purpose and greater ambition. Fewer people dying every day is a great achievement, but more people truly living is an astounding victory for all.However, to get there we have to realize that everyone has an equal voice. People need to be involved in decision-making, since it affects their lives and their livelihoods. They should be foremost in our minds as we consider the worlds natural resources and tackle global concerns such as climate change. There is never only one way of doing things. We can achieve our targets only if we listen to the people whom we are meant to represent and make them part of the decision-making process.A few weeks ago, a young girl, Malala, from Pakistan, spoke in this very Hall of her dream for girls to get an education and wield the power of the pen. Yesterday, at a gathering I attended, she said that everyone should send books, not bombs. Thirteen years ago, our leaders had a dream: to live up to the millennium moment and to better peoples lives. As we approach the year 2015, we need to remember the hope and determination we felt as we crossed into the new millennium, that determination to make the world a somewhat better place through the goals we reach together. We need to carry that forward and continue to make dreams happen. Every day, millions of people around the world dream of something more than a scrap of a life. Indeed, there are no scraps of life."}}
