{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, I should like to extend my sincere congratulations to you, Sir, on The first component of the reform was political transformation. The objective was to bring about peace, stability, national unity and reconciliation. Now we have been able to establish a firm foundation for building a democratic society. Political space has been created for every stakeholder, and the all-inclusive political system is in place. The legislative bodies are also functioning well, in an active and vibrant manner. Numerous pieces of legislation have been enacted to the benefit of the people, including new laws permitting greater freedom of the press, speech and association. A series of amnesties have been granted which have set free thousands of prisoners. We are speedily working through a screening mechanism to ensure that no prisoner of conscience will remain in prison by the end of the year.The emergence of civil societies has also contributed to strengthening democratic values and practices. We have now been able to nurture a new culture of dialogue and accommodation among people of differing views and beliefs. We are also taking steps to establish the rule of law, good governance and clean government.We have also made tangible progress in our efforts towards national reconciliation. The Governments peace overtures have led to ceasefire agreements with all armed groups, for the first time in more than 60 years. We hope that we will be able to celebrate the signing of a nationwide ceasefire agreement in Nay Pyi Taw very soon. We are optimistic that we will be able to start a new round of political dialogue at the Union central level in the near future to strike a comprehensive and lasting peace agreement. We have no illusion that the next step will be easy, but we are determined to pursue this path for the sake of our people, as they have for so long deserved.The hard-won peace and the success of the democratic transformation will not be realistic or sustainable until and unless we deliver on the economic and social needs of the people. Therefore, as the second component of reform, we have opened up the economy through economic liberalization, financial reform, inviting foreign investment, a people-centred development approach, rural development, poverty alleviation and equitable development. We have also created an investor-friendly environment. The Government is focusing on poverty alleviation and rural development. We have aimed at reducing the current poverty rate from 26 per cent to 16 per cent by 2015, as prescribed in the Millennium Development Goals.ever. We have trust in the world bodys capacity and capability to maintain international peace and security, to safeguard fundamental human rights, and to promote economic and social development. Therefore, Myanmar has always cooperated with the United Nations in good faith.As cooperation with the United Nations is the cornerstone of our foreign policy, we have always strictly abided by the decisions and resolutions of the United Nations. We believe that the United Nations should be more democratic, representative and effective in order to face the security and economic challenges in many parts of the world.The continued existence of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, poses the greatest threat to humankind. Myanmar is therefore actively pursuing the cause of nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation in international forums. One testimony of our aspiration is demonstrated by the annual resolution on nuclear disarmament that our delegation has submitted since 1995. Through that resolution we have been calling on nuclear-weapon States to cease immediately the qualitative improvement, development, production and stockpiling of nuclear weapons with a view to taking measures leading to their total elimination within a specified framework of time.In that firm belief, the Government of Myanmar signed the additional protocol to the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards agreement on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons on 17 September. That is yet another significant development testifying to our commitment to the goals of nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation.Myanmar fully subscribes to the fundamental principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Accordingly, Myanmar has been contributing its fair share to regional and international peace and security.On the domestic front, the Government of President U Thein Sein has been undertaking unprecedented wide-ranging political and economic reforms over the past two and a half years. The Government has dedicated its efforts to fulfilling the twin objectives inspired by the people: to establish peace, stability and the rule of law, and to advance socioeconomic development of the lives of the people. rights bodies for the promotion and protection of human rights in the country.Our reform process is still nascent and at a sensitive stage where there is little room for error. With this in mind, the President has publicly emphasized the need for everyone to refrain from doing anything that could jeopardize Myanmars peaceful transition. While undertaking political and other reform processes domestically, we have also been able to reach out to the international community. The overwhelming support that we have received from the international community and the United Nations has contributed significantly to the transition efforts in the country.Myanmar is ready to take over the chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2014 for the very first time since the country joined the Organization in 1997. We regard this opportunity as a great honour. We shall be working closely with our fellow ASEAN members and with ASEAN dialogue partners in discharging this important responsibility so as to move forward in unity to a peaceful and prosperous community.In the process of Myanmars transition to democracy, expectations are high within the country as well as in the international community. For the Government and the people of Myanmar, the task is daunting. There are many challenges ahead. We are still in a critical transition period. However, we are resolute in marching forward along our chosen path. There will be no turning back. But we will not take anything for granted. It is incumbent upon the Government and people of Myanmar to be vigilant at all times so that we do not fall into the trap of the detractors of the reform process.We need the continued support and encouragement of the international community. We always welcome friendly and constructive advice and the helping hands of friends far and near in our nation-building process. However, we are fully cognizant of the fact that ultimately the people Myanmar themselves are responsible for deciding their own destiny and shaping their own future.The Government of President U Thein Sein is laying a solid foundation for democracy, peace and development for the people of Myanmar. Observers have applauded Myanmars transition to democracy as one of the most promising efforts of democratization in the world today. The success we have achieved so far on Recently, the Government turned its focus to private-sector development as another wave of reform. At this stage, the Government is strongly emphasizing the improvement of the institutional infrastructure and regulatory framework so as to facilitate business, trade and investment.We are truly grateful to the international community for its invaluable support and encouragement in our democratic transition as well as in our efforts for the socioeconomic development of the people of Myanmar. We welcome responsible trade and investment that will transfer technology to develop our economy, to create jobs and to lift our people from poverty. We are now taking the necessary steps to become a signatory to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. We will try our best to ensure that no one from the communities or our national ethnic groups will be left behind and excluded from enjoying the fruits of our reforms and the exciting life of the nation.Myanmar is a multiracial and multifaith nation. Various ethnic populations with the worlds four great religions — Buddhists, Christians, Muslims and Hindus — have been living side by side in peace and harmony as fellow citizens of Myanmar. The Constitution of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar also designates the four religions as officially recognized faiths of the country. There are always people who wish to rock the boat. We will not let anyone take advantage of political openness to instigate violence among the different ethnic or religious communities. President U Thein Sein has clearly stated that the Government will take a zero-tolerance approach to anyone fuelling ethnic hatred.The Government has been making serious efforts to resolve the problem through short-term and long-term plans. These include our extensive efforts, in cooperation with the United Nations and humanitarian non-governmental organizations, to improve the living conditions and livelihoods of all affected peoples, without discrimination. Parallel with these efforts, the Government is also encouraging interfaith dialogues across the country with a view to promoting understanding and trust among the different communities. In addition, the National Human Rights Commission, an independent human rights body of Myanmar, has also been working closely and intensively with domestic civil society organizations, interfaith groups and regional and international human count on the support of our friends and the international community.We meet at a time of extraordinary changes. While some have been able to achieve tremendous economic growth and prosperity, millions of people continue to languish in the inhuman depths of poverty. Our relentless drive for economic growth has come at the cost of our environment. The climate is changing. Natural disasters hit us with increasing frequency and intensity. The natural question then is, how do we advance economic growth, promote societal progress and prosperity within the confines of nature? How do we lift the millions of people out of the vicious circle of poverty? How can we ensure that we leave a planet safe and secure for our children and grandchildren?These, I believe, are the key questions that confront us all. Although we come from different parts of the globe, with our unique historical backgrounds and cultural experiences, we are bound by our shared future. In todays interconnected and globalized world, we can prevail only if we come together as global citizens and work to find solutions for the sake of our common future. In this endeavour, Mr. President, as you have rightly stated, failure is not an option.My delegation welcomes the theme “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” for this general debate. The question of the post-2015 development agenda is important, especially for the least developed and landlocked countries, which in many respects have the most at stake. It presents the opportunity for all countries to share their experiences and the kind of development agenda that they would like to see in the post-2015 era.As we set the stage for a development agenda beyond 2015, the Millennium Declaration (resolution ) provides a strong foundation. In our search for a new development agenda we must not forget the important principles set out in the Declaration, but must emphasize their continued relevance. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) inspired nations and a whole generation to improve the lives of many people by creating synergies between nations and among people. All efforts must be made to accelerate the realization of the MDGs during their last mile.The outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (resolution , annex) also outlined important principles on which the post-2015 development agenda should be the road to democracy has been made possible through the joint efforts of the leadership and the people of Myanmar, driven by a strong and genuine desire to change.The road ahead is long and full of challenges. We will spare no effort to overcome any challenges and move ahead on the journey on which we have set out to build a nation of peace, democracy and prosperity. As we continue our journey we need the understanding, continued encouragement and support of the United Nations and the international community. We will never lose sight of our goals, and we are determined to fulfil the aspirations of the people of Myanmar."}}
