{"speech":{"0":" It is a great honour for me to address the Assembly today on behalf of Montenegro and to reaffirm our commitment to the United Nations and its Charter.I wish to congratulate President Ashe on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and to express the full support of the Montenegrin delegation to him personally and for the programme he has put forward. I wish also to extend my gratitude to the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, Mr. Vuk Jeremic, our neighbour, for his energetic efforts and leadership, which contributed to dynamic and constructive discussions on various issues on the United Nations agenda. It is a special pleasure for me to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his deterioration of the situation in Syria and most strongly condemn any form of violence, killing of civilians and violation of human rights. We especially condemn the use of chemical weapons confirmed by the United Nations inspection team, which Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has labeled a war crime. We urge that those responsible for crimes in Syria and for violations of international law be brought to account. The agreement reached between the United States and the Russian Federation gives us hope for a diplomatic solution to the crisis and an end to the conflict in Syria through resolute action on the part of the Security Council. We believe that a political solution and a democratic transition are the only way to end a tragic conflict that has led to a humanitarian crisis of incalculable proportions, affecting the whole region.The case of Syria, among others, highlights the importance of preventive measures and mediation in preserving international peace and security. Strengthening the capacity of the United Nations to achieve an early response and suppress threats before they become a source of conflict will be key to dealing with similar situations in future. Montenegro supports the promotion of the concept of the responsibility to protect and its operationalization, with prevention as an integral element. We are in favour of continuing the debate on the international communitys responsibility for taking timely and decisive action to prevent mass suffering.In the context of the situation in the Middle East, we are particularly pleased by the resumption of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations after several stalled years, and we commend the mediation efforts of the United States Secretary of State. Montenegro believes that direct negotiations are the best way to reach a comprehensive and sustainable settlement.With the intention of taking on additional responsibilities and contributing to the promotion of global peace and security and the observance of universal values, rights and freedoms as a responsible and proactive member of the international community, Montenegro is seeking a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for 2026-2027.Besides its strong support for improving the conception and structural development of United Nations peacebuilding and peacekeeping capacities, Montenegro recognizes the importance of the rule of consideration national characteristics and capacities and individual countries development priorities.After three years of strong economic growth in Montenegro, the global economic and financial crisis affected us, too, leading to a drop in investment, banks credit activities and foreign trade. The patterns of economic growth have changed, so we have adapted our economic policy to the new circumstances. At the same time, the Government has adopted a medium-term development plan modeled on the European Unions Europe 2020 strategy. The three pillars that Montenegro will base its sustainable development on are smart growth, sustainable growth and inclusive growth. The national plan will make our structural and institutional reforms more consistent with development-oriented public measures and investments. Aware of the importance of that issue, we are setting up a centre for sustainable development in Montenegro that will become operational in early 2014. We hope that in time it will take on a regional role and become part of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, based on the outcome of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development.One issue that is inseparable from the post-2015 development framework is that of climate change. Montenegro is committed to intensifying its efforts to promote the adoption by 2015 of a comprehensive and legally binding agreement that would apply to all. We call on every country, in particular the major world economies, to step up their efforts related to mitigating the impact of climate change and reaching a global climate agreement. In that regard, we emphasize our full support for the Secretary-Generals initiative in convening a conference on climate change in September 2014.The maintenance and promotion of international peace and security is a continuing challenge for the United Nations. We note that in some crisis areas, such as Mali, significant progress has been made in reducing violence and instability, while the situations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, the Sudan and South Sudan still need the continued attention and efforts of the Security Council and other relevant actors.Due to the overall consequences for the country itself and for the broader region, the crisis in Syria regrettably still monopolizes the attention of the global body politic and is at the top of the agenda of the United Nations. We are deeply concerned about the continuing is essential, as are revitalizing the General Assembly and reforming the Economic and Social Council. In general, such reform, particularly of the Security Council, would contribute greatly to strengthening the position, relevance and authority of the Organization as a whole and bringing it into harmony with modern geopolitical processes and challenges. Montenegros work within the Organization is based on the principle of multilateral cooperation and respect for the principles and values enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. We are aware of the importance to our visibility and effectiveness at the international level of strong and stable neighbourly relations and of strengthening cooperation in all areas.We are successfully implementing the internal reforms required for the achievement of our main foreign policy priorities â€” membership in the European Union and NATO. The accession negotiations with the European Union, after the provisional closing of two chapters, are entering a new and more demanding phase. The new approach in that phase of the process is based on reforms in the areas of the rule of law, strengthening judicial processes and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, which are of particular importance for the citizens of Montenegro.In parallel, my country is strongly committed to Euro-Atlantic integration. As a country that will soon become a NATO member, we are working devotedly on the fourth annual national programme and reform implementation in order to be fully ready by the time our invitation for alliance membership is formalized. We believe that membership will also contribute to reinforcing security in the Balkans, where events of the recent bitter past can be attributed, in part, to a lack of strong security arrangements.Montenegro is seen as a stability factor in our region, as confirmed by continuing advances in political, economic, social and cultural cooperation with all of its neighbours. With regional cooperation high on our agenda, Montenegro actively participates in regional organizations. We believe that the recently launched West Balkans 6+2 initiative, the modalities of which are the subject of intense discussion, will help us to focus regional activities on specific development projects of common interest to participating States that are aimed at speeding up European integration and improving the quality of life of our citizens. We believe that those efforts, together with European Union synergy, the South-East European Cooperation Process law and the protection of civilians, particularly women and children, and urges United Nations missions to consistently fulfil their mandates in that area. We condemn all forms of violence, especially sexual violence against women and girls in conflict situations, and we therefore support the implementation of the agenda on women and peace and security and, in that context, Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and other relevant resolutions.The adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty as the first legally binding instrument in that area will undoubtedly contribute to global efforts in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation. I am pleased to emphasize that Montenegro was a firm supporter of a comprehensive and strongly worded Arms Trade Treaty from the outset and was among the first 65 countries to sign it. We are conscious of how important it is that the Treaty enters into force as soon as possible and will therefore make every effort to ensure its speedy ratification.The increased integration of human rights into every aspect of the work of the United Nations, ensuring universal respect for human rights, and the effectiveness of the United Nations system in the area of human rights constitute the guidelines for action for Montenegro, especially through the Human Rights Council, of which my country is a member. By cooperating actively with the Council and its special proceedings, as well as with Member States, we contribute to timely and efficient deliberations on issues relating to the promotion of human rights and responding adequately to cases of human rights violations. At the national level, we are striving to strengthen a political, social and economic environment that allows for the free exercise of human rights without any form of discrimination. We focus particularly on strengthening the position and role of women in society and on preventing violence against them and other vulnerable groups, including children, disabled persons and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. As Chair of the Decade of Roma Inclusion for 2005-2010, Montenegro has also focused particularly on improving the position of Roma in our society.Montenegro remains committed to an effective multilateral system in which the United Nations plays a central role, and we support pragmatically oriented initiatives and actions for its reform. We believe that reforming and reorganizing the Security Council, as the key actor in the maintenance of international peace, have improved. Yet along with those accomplishments have come latent dangers. The long-standing dream shared by people across the world of living a safe, peaceful, prosperous and happy life free from hunger remains far from achieved.Humankind yearns for peace, so why is it that many regions remain under the constant threat of disputes, conflicts and wars? The global economy is growing, so how is it that billions of people still live in abject poverty? Science and technology have brought about outstanding advancement, so why have natural disasters, epidemics and pollution become increasingly severe and unpredictable? Those questions impose an enormous responsibility on all of us, as the community of nations.Throughout history, wars have destroyed many civilizations. In only the past 100 years, two world wars and many others â€” including that in Viet Nam â€” have cost millions of lives and produced devastating consequences over generations. While peace, cooperation and development are the dominant trend, the threat of war is ever present. Violence in the Middle East and North Africa is of grave concern. The latest instance in Syria, involving the use of chemical weapons, needs to be strongly condemned. We must give peace every possible chance and find solutions to eliminate chemical weapons, in accordance with international law and United Nations resolutions. Unpredictable developments in the Korean peninsula persist. Territorial disputes still rage in the East China Sea and South China Sea. Just one single incident or ill-conceived act could trigger conflict, or even war.In the East China Sea, through which over half of the worlds shipping passes, maintaining maritime security and freedom of navigation is critical, not only to the region but to the world. Viet Nam consistently pursues a policy of peaceful resolution of disputes to defend its legitimate interests and fully respect those of the global community, in accordance with international law, the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, other regional agreements, and efforts to elaborate a code of conduct.Ho Chi Minh used the words of Thomas Jefferson in Viet Nams Declaration of Independence:and the Regional Cooperation Council, will draw the States of the region closer together and to the common goal of the European Union.The international community, led by the United Nations, with the active participation and decisive contributions of all stakeholders, must continue its search for adequate responses and channel its efforts towards solving the increasingly complex issues and challenges that we are facing. Each and every country, irrespective of size, has, without any doubt, a part to play in finding such solutions, based on the mutual trust and cooperation necessary to build a better world."}}
