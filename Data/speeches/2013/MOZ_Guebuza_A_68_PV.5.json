{"speech":{"0":" It is always a great honour for me to address this magnificent House, symbol of equality among States and an irreplaceable forum of multilateralism that seeks sustainable solutions to the growing global challenges.I join those who spoke before us in congratulating you, Mr. President, on your election to preside over the General Assembly at this session. We believe that your vast experience and knowledge will contribute to the success of our work. We would like to assure you of our support so as to ensure that your mandate is crowned with success.We also congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremic, for a job well done during the sixty-seventh session, which resulted in the reaffirmation of the role of the United Nations as an indispensable multilateral forum.We are shocked by the sad news from Kenya regarding the killing, in an act of terrorism, of innocent Community (SADC). Given its relevance to our theme, we would point out that, over the course of a year and in close collaboration with other member States, the Africa Union, the United Nations and other international partners, we engaged in galvanizing the process of regional integration and in seeking peace and stability for the region.We reiterate our congratulations to Zimbabwe on holding successful elections, whose results were validated by the countrys institutions and endorsed by SADC and the African Union. All the conditions have now been met for the sanctions imposed on that country to be lifted in order to allow for Zimbabwes development and full participation in the global agenda. The stability of the Democratic Peoples Republic of the Congo continues to be a challenge for our region. We would like, once again, to congratulate the Secretary-General for his efforts — in conjunction with SADC, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and the African Union — which resulted in the signing of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region and in the appointment of President Mary Robinson as the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, whom we also congratulate. We reiterate our appeal to all signatories to honour the tenets of that agreement. We appeal to the Congolese actors to conclude the Kampala negotiations so as to ensure the return of lasting stability in the Democratic Peoples Republic of the Congo. The establishment of dates for the presidential and legislative elections this year in Madagascar creates good prospects for the conclusion of the political transition process in that country. We must therefore continue to provide our support to ensure that this process is successful.Within the framework of our chairmanship of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, we remain steadfast and committed to the stability of Guinea-Bissau. We welcome the efforts of the Guinea-Bissau political actors to restore stability to their country. We also commend other partners of Guinea-Bissau — including the Economic Community of West African States, the African Union, the European Union and the United Nations — which have contributed to the creation of a new dynamic that seeks to find lasting solutions to the political crisis. We also welcome the appointment of President Ramos-Horta as Special and negotiation of the development agenda that is to follow the MDGs.Mozambique had the privilege of being part of the group of countries chosen to carry out a national consultation on the post-2015 development agenda. The trust shown in Mozambican civil society to drive that process must be commended because it strengthened the principle of national ownership of the process. It also created the conditions for Mozambican social actors to demonstrate their growing vitality, which is in itself a true reflection of the consolidation of the processes of democratic and inclusive governance in our country.Indeed, we have been furthering our democracy, reinforcing our democratic institutions and consolidating our democratic practices. We do so through transparency, dialogue and participation, instilling respect for the Constitution and broadening inclusiveness to encourage more Mozambicans to become involved in the fight against poverty. An open and inclusive presidency and a governance mechanism replicated at other levels lead us, on the one hand, to interact in a direct and comprehensive way with our people in the places where they live and fight against poverty and, on the other hand, places our governing method under the scrutiny of the people.It is in the context of our commitment to democratic principles and values and to abiding by the legal tenets of our Constitution and laws that, on 20 November, we will hold municipal elections for the fourth time and, in 2014, our fifth general and multiparty elections. The implementation of this electoral cycle is the pinnacle of the exercise of freedom of choice and of citizens political participation in the democratic process.In the context of our commitment to the disarmament agenda — an issue of paramount importance in promoting peace and fighting poverty in Mozambique — and as a way for us to associate ourselves with the cause of international peace and security, we will host, from 29 June to 4 July 2014, the Third International Review Conference of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. We invite all Member States, observers and international and civil society organizations to participate in the Conference.In August, Mozambique successfully concluded its mandate as Chair of the Southern African Development Mr. Armando Emilio Guebuza, President of the Republic of Mozambique, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.Address by Mr. Francois Hollande, President of the French Republic"}}
