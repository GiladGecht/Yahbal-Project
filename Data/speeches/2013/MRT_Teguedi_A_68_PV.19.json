{"speech":{"0":" I am particularly pleased to present our warmest personnel in our country, in addition to the creation of four medical schools to train nurses and senior technicians.Health, which goes in line with education, is a major challenge for developing countries and the African continent in particular. Given that, our Government has allocated an important percentage of its budget for that vital sector and has created national programmes to fight against such deadly diseases as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. In that connection, we have created four new fully equipped hospitals in various parts of the country, in addition to 70 primary-care clinics. We must also note the construction of a specialized oncology hospital, which is considered to be among the most sophisticated in the region. The health-care sector also works closely with United Nations specialized agencies in organizing ongoing vaccination campaigns for children under 5 years of age. As with most developing countries, our country depends on imports of basic goods from the global market, which weighs heavily on our balance sheets, especially since the prices of such products are subject to f luctuations in the world market. Aware of that, our Government has pursued an economic and financial policy that would alleviate the effects generated from outside. Our agricultural sector has therefore been able, thanks to the policy, to fulfil 60 per cent of the countrys rice needs and 37 per cent of its need for other grains. Wheat crops, which were recently introduced, have begun to produce. In that context, a sugar-cane cultivation project was launched to make sugar available locally. Generally, our Government has worked tirelessly in all sectors to ensure that its citizens can live in dignity. A free-trade zone has been created in Nouadhibou — the economic capital of the country and the third-largest city in population — which will transform the region into an important economic centre benefiting the country and the region as a whole.In order to strengthen good governance and the fight against corruption, the Inspector General and the Court of Auditors have been revitalized since President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz took office. Significant funds in some sectors have been poorly managed, but have been reimbursed to the State. Civil servants have been made accountable for the poor allocation of certain resources. Agreements were reached to end the no-bid contract system. The lack of competitive bidding We also call upon those countries to implement an appropriate policy, under the supervision of the United Nations specialized agencies and in cooperation with the international financial institutions, that will be based primarily on the following: support for health and education systems; debt forgiveness; the transfer of the necessary technology; the improvement of North-South trade; the removal of customs duties on exports from the developing countries, especially the least developed countries, to the markets of the North; the promotion of South-South cooperation, which will probably strengthen economic cooperation between group members; the establishment of new international mechanisms that will be charged with overseeing regional complementarity, strengthening South-South relations, as underscored in the aforementioned Human Development Report, which will facilitate the sharing of know-how, lessons learned and technology transfer between those countries.Under the leadership of the President of the Republic, Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, our Government is working to improve the standard of living of our citizens, despite our limited resources. In order to attain that objective, the Government has pursued a rigorous educational policy, based on compulsory and widespread primary education and the strengthening of a modern secondary education with free higher education in several different fields. Basic schooling is now available in almost all of our villages and cities. That was made possible thanks to the Government policy of limiting anarchic urbanization by merging numerous villages.With regard to secondary education, all the departments throughout the country now have middle schools and many have high schools. That has allowed the children of people living in remote villages to continue their secondary schooling. High schools reserved for the most promising students were also established to take advantage of their talents and steer them towards specializations that meet the needs of the labour market. Higher education took a large qualitative step forward. A university campus has just been completed in Nouakchott. An Islamic studies university has been opened in the interior of the country, as well as four specialized schools of higher education, including the School of Mines, the Polytechnic, the School of Agricultural Training and Public Works. The Faculty of Medicine has been strengthened and endowed with the means necessary to cover the shortfall in medical that the States of the Sahel cannot tackle the scourge on their own. Based on its sense of duty, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, which has stood by Mali since the beginning of the crisis, quickly opened its borders to our Malian brothers and sisters who were seeking refuge in our territory. We have provided and continue to provide shelter for those individuals. Our capital, Nouakchott, over many months hosted a series of negotiations between the Malian provisional authorities and the Azawad groups, which led to the signing of the Ougadougou accords, thus facilitating the preparations for the presidential elections. We take this opportunity to express our sincere congratulations to the people of the sister nation of Mali and the hope that the changes will lead to a new era of well-being, security and progress.Our country strongly condemns the horrific terrorist attack on the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, which cost the lives of dozens of individuals.For more than two years, certain countries of the Arab region have experienced instability owing to the so-called Arab Spring. Our country, respectful of the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, expresses its full solidarity with the peoples of those countries. With deep concern and worry, we are following the most recent developments in the Syrian Arab Republic. We invite all stakeholders to refrain from violence and any escalation of violence and, instead, to follow the logic of dialogue, aimed at finding a peaceful solution so as to spare the brotherly Syrian people from suffering and tragedy. At the same time, with respect to the preservation, territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Syrian territory, it is our hope that the mission of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States on the Syrian crisis, will achieve success. It is our firm hope that a swift solution can be found that will bring an end to the bloodshed, destruction of infrastructure and economic devastation in sisterly Syria.We hope that the people of Egypt, Yemen, Libya and Tunisia can quickly conclude their transition periods and build democratic institutions that will guarantee the rights and dignity of their citizens in an atmosphere of well-being and prosperity.Our country pays close attention to the situation in Western Sahara. We reaffirm our support for the has undermined equity among the various economic drivers of national and international markets.Transparency now prevails in the recruitment of civil servants — thanks to competitive examinations — fostering equality among men and women and providing hope to young people. Merit-based candidate selection is now possible, leading to an end to nepotism and favouritism.The Governments austerity policy, including its reduced administrative budget and increased investment budget, has contributed to the self-financing of the majority of the countrys development projects. The policy has also led to reduced unemployment, which now hovers around 10 per cent. The policies have also contributed to an increased growth rate, which should attain, according to current forecasts, more than 6 per cent by the end of the year. We have also been preparing for municipal and legislative elections slated for the end of the year. That will strengthen good governance and allow our citizens to participate in the process of defining the countrys future, and setting political and economic priorities for our country.Our foreign policy is solidly based on a concern for strengthening good-neighbourly relations and non-interference in the internal affairs of States. We will work with our Maghreb region — Arab and African — with a sense of duty towards international relations and issues so as to disseminate a culture of peace, encourage dialogue and the resort to wisdom, and facilitate the role of diplomacy as a means of resolving conflicts and avoiding or ending war.President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, who has not wavered in exerting his utmost efforts, as the Head of the African Union Peace and Security Council, to find solutions to certain conflicts in the African continent, including in Cote dIvoire, Libya and Mali. He has played a very important role, through his presence at subregional and international summits, focusing on peace and security around the world. For a number of years, the African Sahel region has been subjected to all types of cross-border organized crime, including drug trafficking, arms trafficking, illegal immigration and kidnapping. We reiterate our call to the international community to support the States of the region in tackling those dangers, which have recently threatened the very existence of a States Members of the United Nations. That clearly shows enjoy justice and equality — the very lofty principles for which our Organization was created. These are the only guarantees of our success."}}
