{"speech":{"0":" As we meet this morning to address global concerns and seek ways to ensure progress and lasting peace, the people of Kenya are emerging from a terrorist attack that has cost them many lives and shaken the continent. In expressing our solidarity with the Government and the people of Kenya and with the families of the victims, Mauritius would also like to express its unreserved condemnation of that abominable and dastardly act of terrorism. The Nairobi attack should also compel us to revisit regional and global responses to national and international security threats, including extending support to countries, particularly those on the African continent.Mauritius commends you, Mr. President, for the theme you have proposed for the sixty-eighth session of the Assembly, namely, “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. The goals we set ourselves for the sustainable development of our national and global economies will shape the lives of generations to come. I would like to say at the outset that Mauritius welcomes the report of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through Sustainable Development, and in particular the recommendation that deliberations on a new development agenda must be guided by the vision of eradicating extreme poverty for all in the context of sustainable development. We also welcome the Panels view that one of the transformative shifts for the post-2015 agenda should be to bring a new sense of global partnership into national and international politics.Climate change should be one of the top priorities for the global agenda. The report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis, released only yesterday, is unequivocal. It provides clear scientific confirmation governance is clearly long overdue. We must have a more participatory system of global economic governance, where developing countries would be more involved in international economic decision-making and norm-setting. The voice of all nations, big or small, should be equally heard and taken into consideration.Mauritius has, on several occasions, reiterated that the United Nations Economic and Social Council needs to play a more prominent role in global economic, social, and environmental issues. We cannot overstate the importance of coordination and synergy for avoiding duplication among parallel United Nations processes and initiatives so as to ensure optimal benefit for all.My Government is of the view that all the processes initiated in the Rio+20 Conference last year, including those relating to strengthening the Economic and Social Council, sustainable development goals and sustainable development financing, should converge towards a single post-2015 development agenda that should be adopted during a high-level development summit in 2015. The post-2015 development agenda should complete the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals. However, it should also go beyond them and provide for a systemic change and a new global economic governance. The guiding principles enshrined in the Declaration on the Right to Development, adopted in December 1986 (resolution ), are still relevant today and should not be overlooked in the formulation of a post-2015 development agenda.My country will follow, with particular interest, the work of the high-level political forum on sustainable development, especially since it replaces the Commission on Sustainable Development, which was the primary intergovernmental forum for monitoring the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation.As we set the stage for the post-2015 development agenda, we must, as global leaders, define a new global vision for the worlds oceans. The United Nations system has played a crucial role in formulating, implementing and enforcing a new international order relating to the oceans. Indeed, the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982 will remain one of the landmarks of the twentieth century.The jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea has contributed to the settlement of maritime disputes and the promotion of international peace, Furthermore, it could be an opportunity to give new meaning to the concept of global concerns, issues that are, or should be, the concern of the global community at large, and not only of those who are more vulnerable and more at risk. That would be in line with the spirit of the global partnership that the High-level Panel has called for.The prospects for growth in the global economy remain uncertain, largely as a result of the multiple challenges faced by developed countries. In such an interconnected and interdependent world as ours, no nation is immune to external shocks. Small developing countries are very concerned about the slowdown in global growth, declines in international trade, decreasing job opportunities and rising inequality. Small States are particularly susceptible to external shocks, as they are heavily dependent on foreign markets for trade, tourism and investments. They are also concerned about energy and food prices, which are subject to high volatility.My Government believes that the post-2015 development agenda should include a road map for an interconnected world economic system, premised on the assumption that the global economy could very well be as weak as its weakest links. Of course, the specificities of some countries or regions and the pace at which the transformative shifts are implemented may not always be appropriate for universal targets. But the conceptual approach to, and the design of, the post-2015 agenda should, more than ever before, start with the shared conviction that economies are interdependent.Eradicating extreme poverty, empowering more women, providing wider opportunities to young people for education and jobs, improving health care and the management of energy, water and food are all universal concerns. The conventional divides of the past are no longer valid. We need a common development framework but with differentiated milestones and implementation strategies, given the existing disparities in the levels of development. Actions taken at the national level are not sufficient; there should also be reinforced cooperation and partnerships at the regional and international levels. It is therefore imperative that the weaknesses and the inequity of the current global economic governance should be addressed urgently.We are at a juncture where we have no option but to revisit the existing global economic governance mechanisms. An overhaul of the current economic and non-permanent categories. We reaffirm our commitment to the African common position enshrined in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. We believe that Africa should not be deprived of its right to permanent representation in the Council. Likewise, we believe that Latin America deserves permanent representation in the Council and that SIDS should also be entitled to a seat on the Council. Mauritius further reiterates its support for Indias legitimate aspiration to a permanent seat in a reformed Security Council.Mauritius also reiterates its firm conviction that the rule of law should prevail in the resolution of disputes, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. We believe that the international community has an obligation to ensure that, in line with the principles of the rule of law, nations should submit their disputes to conciliation, mediation, adjudication or other peaceful means, both judicial and non-judicial.The dismemberment of part of our territory, the Chagos archipelago, prior to independence, by the then colonial Power the United Kingdom, was in clear breach of international law and left the process of decolonization, not only of Mauritius but of Africa in general, incomplete. Yet, the United Kingdom has shown no inclination to engage in any process that would lead to a settlement of that shameful part of its colonial past. I am confident that the United Kingdom and the United States of America want to be on the right side of history. States that look to the law and to the rules of the comity of nations for the resolution of disputes should not be frustrated by the lack of avenues under international law for the settlement of such disputes.Tromelin, which is also an integral part of our territory, is the subject of ongoing discussions with the French Government, and pending a final resolution of the issue, Mauritius and France have concluded a framework agreement on the co-management of the island and its surrounding maritime areas, without prejudice to the sovereignty of Mauritius over Tromelin.In our part of the world, we welcome the rise of a re-energized Africa. The return to normalcy in Mali and the recent holding of elections there show the relevance of international partnerships. The situation in Madagascar and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will, hopefully, be resolved soon through the support of the international community for the initiatives of the Southern African Development Community in that regard.security and equity in a manner not always witnessed in other areas of international relations. The establishment of the International Seabed Authority is another significant example of what international cooperation can lead to in other sectors. The International Maritime Organization and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO are also making significant contributions.I believe that the United Nations must now take the lead in formulating a global vision for the oceans that will, in particular, expand the economic space for small island States while ensuring sustainable use of living and non-living resources. The health of our economies will depend on the health of our oceans. Our vision for the future must also preserve the inherent values of the ocean space, to which we are looking for economic expansion.Mauritius has taken the initiative of launching a national dialogue on how to promote the ocean economy as one of the main pillars of development. We urge the international community to build on what the world has achieved so far in relation to ocean-related economic activities and conservation, and we propose for future generations a fundamental paradigm shift with respect to economic space. While such a global vision and strategy will be beneficial to all nations, it will be of particular interest to small islands. With limited land areas, the islands can potentially be large ocean States and thus overcome some of their vulnerabilities as small island developing States. As the world realizes the tremendous potential of marine renewable energies, we will see the oceans from a different perspective.The United Nations has a key role to play in promoting the rule of law at both the national and the international levels. The rule of law at the international level must be an integral part of the post-2015 agenda. Open and participatory democracy, accountability and transparency are not concepts that should be promoted only at the national level. The United Nations should lead by example here. We should focus on reforming our Organization and on making it more responsive to the needs and aspirations of its constituents.In that context, we should work together on the reform of the Security Council and the revitalization of the General Assembly and on improving the working methods of our Organization. Mauritius believes that a comprehensive reform of the Security Council should include reform in the membership of both the permanent shared vision of peace, security, interdependence and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms.We must remain staunch in protecting the right to development. We also have the duty to take a differentiated approach so as to ensure that our development model is sustainable and allows us to leave to future generations the values our world holds dear. Our success will depend on the collective will and commitment. If we succeed, we will go down in history as having met todays challenges and expectations in terms of the future.(spoke in English)To conclude, let me say that we need to act together, in a spirit of compromise and tolerance. We should constantly remind ourselves that we are of one kind, humankind. There are not, and never will be, ideal solutions that will satisfy all of us. But we, the leaders of our respective countries, need to look beyond the horizon and have the moral courage to look at our common humanity so that we may move forward towards making our world a better, more prosperous and safer place for the whole of humankind."}}
