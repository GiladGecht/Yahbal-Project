{"speech":{"0":" Allow me to begin by congratulating the President of the General Assembly on his election. I offer him Malaysias full cooperation and support as he seeks to further the cause of peace and prosperity.Three years ago, I stood before the General Assembly and called for a global movement of moderates (see ). It was a call to reject extremism in all its forms, because the real divide is not between East and West or between the developed and developing worlds or between Muslims, Christians and Jews. It is between moderates and extremists of all religions. Much has changed since 2010, when a current of protest and reform surged through the Middle East and North Africa. Out of the heat of the Arab Spring, new questions arose about the pace of democratic change, the role of Islam in politics, and the need for more inclusive development. But the search for answers to those questions has been put on hold. As authoritarian regimes have fallen, and Governments have been swept away by political change, extremists have tried to fill that space. Motivated by ideology, politics and religion, they have sought refuge from the hard work of development in the unholy practice of violence. Conflicts have spilled across borders, inflaming old tensions and igniting new that we hold to the principles displayed by the Prophet Muhammad in the Medina Charter.Our task therefore is to reclaim our faith by articulating clearly the true nature of Islam as a religion of peace, moderation and tolerance. We should speak that message clearly so that all may hear it and stand firm against the minority who use Islam to further violent and unjust ends. We should not mistake moderation for weakness. To face those baying for violence and call instead for calm is a sign not of frailty, but of strength. Muslim leaders should speak up and condemn such violence, lest their silence be mistaken for acceptance.Moderation can be practiced at the national level, as it is in Malaysia, by choosing mutual respect and inclusivity and strengthening the bonds between different communities and faiths. All countries should reinforce their commitment to the principles of moderation, not just in religion, but for sustainable development and stable economic growth.Moderation can also direct regional policy. It sits at the heart of Malaysias efforts to bring peace to the southern Philippines and to Thailands restive South. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which endorsed the Global Movement of Moderates, has made a commitment to the peaceful settlement and non-use of force in territorial disputes. At the international level, moderation can guide our approach to the great global challenges of our age: violent extremism, sustainable development and equitable growth.Secondly, we should give our all to resolve the political problems that raise tensions in the Muslim world, starting with Syria. We cannot underline strongly enough the need for a Syrian-led inclusive political process. Malaysia is against any unilateral action to resolve the conflict. All sides must come together to work out a political settlement. We welcome the recent United States-Russia framework agreement, condemn without reservation the use of chemical weapons, and call on the international community to intensify its efforts to explore all possible diplomatic options for peace under the auspices of the United Nations.We must also find the vision and political will to commit to a just solution for Palestine. We fervently hope that progress towards a viable Palestinian State, based on pre-1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital, will be made, and that the United States and Shia. In one Iraqi town, four children from one Shia family were slain with knives. In another, local people — neighbours for generations — have built blast walls to keep themselves apart. Forced displacements are growing.In Pakistan, bombings have wrecked the city of Quetta, killing hundreds. Revenge attacks spread to Lahore and bombs have been detonated in Karachi. In August, militants ambushed buses, dividing the passengers according to belief. Those who answered incorrectly were executed.Each of these conflicts has a distinct cause, but they follow a darkly familiar path: emboldened by political failures, radical preachers and militant groups turn civil conflicts into wider religious wars. Yet the preaching of such violence is completely counter to the Islamic faith. The Holy Koran not only condemns suicide, unjust war and retribution by force; it also makes clear the Prophets desire for Muslims to live in peace with one another and their neighbours. It says “And if they incline to peace, then incline to it and rely upon Allah” (The Holy Koran, VIII:61) and that “whoever kills a soul, unless for a soul or for corruption in the land — it is as if he had slain mankind entirely” (ibid., V:32). It also holds that “there shall be no compulsion in religion” (ibid., II:256).It should come as no surprise that there is no scriptural basis for the atrocities being committed in the name of Islam. Under the six higher objectives of Islamic law, the first and foremost is the protection and preservation of life. Yet even during Ramadan, our holy month, when contemplation, devotion and compassion reign uppermost in Muslim minds, the extremists would not stop. More than 4,400 people died this Ramadan in Syria, 371 in Iraq and 120 in Pakistan. This is a burden we can no longer afford to bear. It is time to end the killing; it is time to concentrate instead on building a common agenda for peace and prosperity.There are two things we can do. First of all, I believe that peace-loving Muslims — the overwhelming majority of Muslims — should unite against the extremists who use our religion as an excuse to commit violence. And one of the most powerful tools we have to do so is al-wasatiyyah — the practice of moderation. The Holy Koran says that “we have made you into a community that is justly balanced” (ibid., II:143). This concept of balance and moderation, of social justice within our faith, is a central tenet of Islam.
