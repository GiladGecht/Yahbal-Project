{"speech":{"0":" Last week a heinous terrorist attack was perpetrated against the Republic of Kenya, We have also slashed poverty by more than half. Moreover, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, we are one of the few countries in the world that have not only reduced poverty but also improved nutrition. The eradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development must become a key principle and objective of global economic governance and a guidepost for the action of international financial and trade institutions.While I speak of these achievements, I would be remiss if I did not point out the grave challenges confronting us even as we seek to build on the foundations that have already been laid. We in the Caribbean have experienced major setbacks due to the international economic and financial crises that started in North America and Europe. While it appears that those two regions are emerging from the crises, the effects continue to be devastating in the Caribbean. Even as we continue to grapple with the effects of the financial crisis, we are now faced with the graduation and differentiation imposed by some of our international partners. We are told that as middle-income countries, measured by per capita gross domestic product (GDP), we are no longer entitled to concessionary financing. This is a recipe for reversing the gains made over the years of hard work and sacrifice. We call for a rethink of that position and urge that greater consideration be given to the special vulnerabilities of our region, where a country can see its entire GDP wiped out by a single hurricane or, as in our country in 2005, when 60 per cent of its GDP was wiped out because of f loods. Clearly what we need is increased cooperation with the international community and our development partners, and not less.Another serious challenge to sustainable development is the impact of climate change. This is even more the case for small island developing States, which are represented in the Assembly. Some of them face an imminent passage to oblivion. Climate change is not of our making but, sadly, as small island developing States and low-lying coastal States, we remain the victims of its most adverse impacts. Unfortunately, instead of a reduction in the emissions of greenhouse gases, there has been a rise of nearly 50 per cent. This marked failure to take decisive action poses a threat to all humankind. It is tragic that while we all know that dangers that lurk due to global warming and climate change, we seem incapable of stopping ourselves. agenda should take into account the valid concerns and challenges faced by middle-income countries, such as access to grants and concessional funding for developmental purposes. The post-2015 development agenda should also embrace the protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and the maintenance of international peace and security. I wish to emphasize that sustainable development requires adequate and predictable financing at the local and international levels.Namibia is concerned about the conflict situations and growing instability in many parts of the world. We welcome the signing of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Region. Namibia urges all signatories to the Framework to work together in good faith towards its full implementation. We commend the efforts of the Intervention Brigade to restore peace in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and call on the international community to give its full support to achieving the success of that important mission. We also appeal to the international community to provide humanitarian assistance to the communities affected by the conflict.Namibia welcomes the decision of Madagascars reformed special electoral court, paving the way for holding presidential and parliamentary elections there next month. We call on the international community to provide the financial, technical and logistical support necessary for those elections to be successful.Our Government continues to support the efforts of the African Union (AU), through the African Union Mission in Somalia, to stabilize the situation in Somalia.The Southern African Development Community and AU election observer missions have declared the harmonized elections that recently took place in Zimbabwe to be free, peaceful and credible. In that context, Namibia calls for the unconditional lifting of all sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe.We welcome the holding of democratic elections in Mali and congratulate President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita on his election. We commend the Economic Community of West African States and other international partners for the leading role they have played in resolving the crisis in that country.I take this opportunity to reiterate our steadfast solidarity with the people of Cuba, who have endured resulting in the death and injury of dozens innocent civilians as well as the destruction of property. We condemn this senseless attack and express our fraternal solidarity with the people of Kenya.The theme for the sixty-eighth session is “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. It echoes the words of the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations: “to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom”. As leaders, we are therefore challenged to ensure that the post-2015 development agenda promotes sustainable development and a secure future for current and future generations.When the Millennium Summit adopted the Millennium Development Goals in 2000, it emphasized the urgency of making the world a better place for all humanity. That promise gave hope to millions who live in abject poverty and deprivation in many parts of the world. As we approach the 2015 deadline, we should ask ourselves whether we have lived up to the commitments that we made in 2000. We believe that the post-2015 development agenda should be people-centred and inclusive, with a focus on the provision of health care, education, food security and nutrition, energy, potable water, gender equality and the empowerment of women, young people and people with disabilities.The challenges of climate change and environmental conservation should continue to be a focus of our attention. During the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012, we made commitments to create a new global partnership characterized by a new spirit of solidarity, cooperation and mutual accountability. The outcome document of the Conference, entitled “The future we want” (resolution , annex), identified poverty eradication as the greatest global challenge facing the world today and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development.As I speak, the eleventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification is about to conclude its deliberations in our capital city, Windhoek. We believe that the outcome of the Conference will further strengthen the Conventions role in mitigating the effects of desertification and droughts, particularly on the continent of Africa.While developing countries have made commendable advances in the areas of social and economic development, many challenges remain. Namibia holds the view that the post-2015 development Mr. Nicos Anastasiades, President of the Republic of Cyprus, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall."}}
