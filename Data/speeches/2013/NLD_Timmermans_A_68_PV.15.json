{"speech":{"0":" This year, we celebrate the centennial of the Peace Palace in The Hague, seat of the International Court of Justice (ICC) and the Permanent Court of Arbitration, and symbol of the pursuit of peace by means of law. Next year, we will commemorate the centennial of the first of two suicidal world wars that caused unspeakable human suffering, horrible crimes against humanity and the oppression of half of Europes population until the Berlin wall came down in 1989.Out of the ashes of those global conflagrations grew the desire of the peoples of the world to put an end to violent conflict and to guarantee human rights for every human being in every country. “Never again” is what humankind wanted. Unfortunately, so far it is not what we have been able to deliver to everyone.During the festive celebrations this year in The Hague, which gave fresh impetus to the peaceful settlement of disputes, there were scenes of unspeakable violence in Syria, including the use of chemical weapons. More recently, in Nairobi, dozens of people were killed by terrorists. One of the victims was Dr. Elif Yavuz, a young Dutch woman who was eight months pregnant with her first baby. My heart goes out to Dr. Yavuzs family, to all the victims of the Nairobi attack and to their loved ones.The powerlessness of the international community to put an end to abuses like those has led in the past to the establishment of new bodies and instruments. After the Second World War, the United Nations was founded and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted. Following more recent genocides, the International Criminal Court was established. The use of chemical weapons by Saddam Hussein led to the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). So the institutions and instruments are in place. The question is, what is preventing them from delivering results? Perhaps the answer to the question was given already four centuries ago by Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza when he wrote: “Peace is not an absence of When Australia led the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) 13 years ago with our friends from New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and other countries of the Pacific, one of the first tasks the Mission faced was to restore peace and security. RAMSI moved quickly to secure the surrender of firearms — an early and decisive action that underpinned the peace that was built and maintained over the next 10 years. And women played a crucial part.That is why, throughout the Pacific, we are supporting efforts to strengthen womens participation in policing, through recruitment, retention, training and mentoring support. In the Philippines, Australia is funding womens participation in peace processes that bring together Muslim, Christian and indigenous women. And we continue to build on our record on security, disarmament and peacekeeping. As co-author of the draft resolution, we worked to secure the adoption of the worlds first Arms Trade Treaty (resolution B), which has now been signed by the majority of the United Nations membership, with a further 18 signatories being obtained during the course of this week.Outside of the Council, we work directly with countries in our region to build their security. Australia commends the efforts of Timor-Leste and the Group of Seven Plus countries emerging from conflict, including Solomon Islands and Afghanistan, in their efforts to promote the rule of law, civil and political institutions and a strong private sector.The United Nations is a vital forum for the security and prosperity of our world. That is what Harry Truman, President of the United States at the time the United Nations was founded, imagined when he spoke of a “world fabric of international security and growing prosperity”. No community can build lives, families and nations in the absence of stability, predictability and security. No country can ensure the security of its people without an economy that offers them the dignity to pursue lives they value.As you have made clear, Mr. President, the task the United Nations takes on this year and next, setting the stage for the post-2015 development agenda, is one that could set the course of humankind for decades to come. On behalf of the people of Australia, I wish all nations well in taking on that task, and commit Australia to play its part. Together, we will strive to build the prosperity As the Secretary-General said, those responsible for the atrocities in Syria should be held accountable in accordance with international law. The use of chemical weapons is a war crime under the Rome Statute. If the Syrian Government itself sees no possibility of tracking down and prosecuting the guilty parties, it can ask the ICC to do so. If Syria makes no request, the Security Council must take action. Finally, as the Secretary-General also said, we can hardly be satisfied with the destruction of chemical weapons while the wider war continues to destroy Syria and kill innocent people. A peaceful solution is needed. And the women of Syria should be involved in making that happen, as there can be no solution without them.Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security provides an outstanding tool for promoting inclusive conflict resolution. This week we hosted a side event marking the importance of womens political participation for successful transitions in the Middle East and North Africa. The Executive Director of UN-Women told me earlier this week that courage is every womans middle name. It certainly is in Syria.The Netherlands supports John Kerrys efforts to encourage Israel and the Palestinian Authority to arrive at a two-State solution through direct negotiations. The international community should support the Israeli-Palestinian talks. Only a political solution can lead to lasting peace.Fifty years ago, United States President John F. Kennedy expressed the fear that in the 1970s there would be 15, 20 or even 25 nuclear-weapon States. Thanks in part to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, that danger was averted, but the risk of further proliferation of nuclear weapons has not receded. While much has been achieved in the field of disarmament, there is still a long way to go. In his speech in Berlin in June, President Obama warned of the danger of nuclear weapons. “As long as nuclear weapons exist, we are not truly safe”, he said — and he is right. He plans to take new steps to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals. He also wants to make substantial reductions in the number of United States and Russian non-strategic weapons in Europe. The Netherlands is in favour of those steps, strongly supports the efforts and wants to contribute to them.In March of next year, the Nuclear Security Summit will convene in The Hague. My countrys hosting of the Summit is in keeping with our tradition as a country of war; it is a virtue, a state of mind, a disposition for benevolence, confidence, justice”.It is my conviction that the international community must keep working on the project we launched a hundred years ago. We should follow the example of Dr. Yavuz, who was committed to helping people suffering from HIAIDS and malaria. We should work to achieve her aims and uphold her ideals. We should make clear that terrorism will never triumph. We should invest in the United Nations and support it as effectively as we can. We strongly support the Secretary-General and the message he delivered here on Tuesday (). We will join him on the road to peace, justice and development.The Netherlands advocates a coherent agenda for strengthening the international legal order. A peaceful world demands a sustainable legal order and a powerful agenda for development. It demands a strategy for disarmament and a focus on human rights. Those are the principles of the foreign policy of the Netherlands. A partnership for peace, justice and development is the cornerstone of the Dutch candidacy for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council in 2017-2018.The world was shocked to discover that an attack with chemical weapons had taken place in Syria on 21 August. The attack violated one of the most important peremptory norms of international law. The 1925 Geneva Protocol, to which Syria is a party, bans the use of chemical weapons. The situation in Syria poses a clear threat to international peace and security. The Netherlands calls on the Security Council to take concerted action to address that threat. We have just heard from the representative of Australia what is going to happen today.Mrs. Bruell-Melchior (Monaco), Vice-President, took the Chair.Syria does not comply with the international norm that requires it to protect its citizens. But the international community also has a responsibility. The Netherlands supports the proposal that permanent Security Council members should henceforth refrain from using their veto power in votes on intervention to stop the mass atrocity crimes identified by the 2005 World Summit. They should show that they are serious about their responsibility to protect vulnerable populations, underlining our consensus that genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing must never be tolerated. accede to the Rome Statute and that popular support for it be maintained. We need to ensure that countries that have acceded to the Statute continue to work with the ICC.This year marks the sixty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the twentieth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration. The Universal Declaration is an enduring source of inspiration. It was adopted without a single dissenting vote under the inspired leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt, who acted as a change agent before the expression was coined. Just before the vote she said, “We stand today at the threshold of a great event both in the life of the United Nations and in the life of mankind” (see 0).The World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna underlined that human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated. Twenty years after Vienna, the blueprints of our human rights infrastructure are complete. Now it is time to ensure the necessary implementation, political will, capacity, financial resources and treaty body reforms. To that end, Dutch human rights policy stresses the importance of forging trilateral partnerships in different regions of the world. We focus on protecting human rights defenders and promoting LGBT and womens rights.Without development, there can be no global peace and security. We are fast approaching 2015, and have made great progress. In the next two years we can still make a difference and advance towards the Millennium Development Goals. The post-2015 development agenda will also benefit from a single, unified framework. We cannot talk about the plight of the worlds poorest people in isolation from the environmental problems endangering life on our planet. It is crucial to ensure that development is sustainable so that we can balance and integrate its economic, social and ecological dimensions. Peace, security and the rule of law constitute a fourth vital element of sustainable development.The key words for the post-2015 development agenda are better aid, more trade and stronger policy coherence for sustainable development. Also, we need to promote womens rights. That includes sexual and reproductive health and rights, as well as equal opportunity. I have four children — two of them are girls. It would be unbearable for me, as a parent, if they did not have equal opportunity as their brothers.peace, justice and security. Nuclear materials can play an important role in curing our illnesses and heating our homes. And fortunately, the likelihood of terrorists using nuclear materials in an attack is small. But if it did happen, the consequences for the world would be very serious indeed.The Nuclear Security Summit is meant to give fresh impetus to global efforts to ensure nuclear security and prevent nuclear terrorism by making and implementing agreements at the highest multilateral level. Governments, businesses, researchers and organizations from many countries are working together to reduce the quantities of nuclear materials, to enhance the security of the materials that remain, and to combat nuclear smuggling.The centennial of the Peace Palace is a good occasion to highlight the peaceful settlement of disputes. The Netherlands has used the celebrations to strengthen instruments for peaceful settlement. We advocate taking three interrelated steps.First, we need to encourage countries to recognize the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. As States Members of the United Nations, we recognize the Court as a principal organ of the United Nations. In my view, recognizing its compulsory jurisdiction is a logical and necessary next step. Secondly, we must help countries realize how useful and f lexible arbitration is as a way of settling disputes. The Security Council and the General Assembly could draw parties attention to that instrument more often and we should advocate it more often in the public debate. Thirdly, we must reduce the obstacles to the peaceful settlement of disputes by making alternatives available. This is why the Netherlands enthusiastically supports the Department of Political Affairs and non-governmental organization that promote mediation.In his 2011 report on the responsibility to protect (), the Secretary-General rightly pointed out the importance of mediation as a means of preventing atrocity crimes. National legal systems are the foundation of the international legal order. Strengthening national legal systems should make it possible to keep the courtrooms of the International Criminal Court closed.The ICC is inextricably linked to the global chain of legal institutions. It delivers justice in the wake of international crimes, thus helping to prevent future offences. So it is crucial that countries continue to "}}
