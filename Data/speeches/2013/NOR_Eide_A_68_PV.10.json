{"speech":{"0":" We are living in times of rapid change. Global and regional dynamics are transforming global governance. A changing world will inevitably change the United Nations. But we, the Members of this great Organization, can influence the direction of the change. In order to do so, however, we must set strategic priorities. We should develop an agile multilateral system for the twenty-first century.The architects of the United Nations were in many ways ahead of their time. The Charter, in its Chapters VI and VIII, foresaw a world where the United Nations should safeguard international peace and security, the settlement of disputes and the promotion of common interests at the regional, as much as at the global, level. By 1945, however, there were few established regional mechanisms. In other words, the Charters provisions for regional arrangements were largely aspirational.In todays world, regional organizations and arrangements are increasingly proving their relevance. Economic, social and political integration is taking place at the regional level. Cooperation is not only about outcomes, but also about processes. Practical cooperation can lay the foundation for strategic trust and shared values. in particular, which has reached proportions unprecedented in the history of that country, Cameroon and other States of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) have shouldered their responsibilities by sending troops to Bangui to stabilize the situation. Similarly, we have actively contributed to the establishment of a road map that should enable them to restore normal constitutional order within 18 to 24 months. “Cameroon calls on the international community to support the efforts of the Central African subregion, in particular in order to quickly operationalize the international support mission for the Central African Republic and to mobilize humanitarian assistance commensurate with the problems the country faces. “Those political, security and humanitarian crises are compounded by recurrent acts of banditry, such as abductions of civilians and maritime piracy. The development of the latter criminal activity, which poses a threat to international trade, has reached alarming proportions. According to the International Maritime Bureau, the number of acts of piracy identified along the coast of West Africa in 2012 exceeded for the first time the number of attacks in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean.“To deal with that problem, Yaounde, Cameroons capital, hosted on 24 and 25 June, in accordance with Security Council resolution 2039 (2012), of 29 February 2012, a joint summit of the Economic Community of Central Africa States, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Commission of the Gulf of Guinea (GGC) on maritime safety and security in the Gulf of Guinea. This was aimed at combatting piracy, armed robbery and other illegal activities perpetrated in the maritime space of the Gulf of Guinea.“The Heads of State and Government of ECCAS, ECOWAS and the CGG, meeting together for the first time since the establishment of those three institutions, decided to set up an interregional coordination centre to monitor anti-piracy efforts in their common maritime space and to pool their resources. The headquarters of the centre, whose purpose is to implement a regional strategy to combat piracy, armed robbery and other illicit acts in the Gulf of Guinea, was given to Cameroon. Everything is being done to make it operational as principles of the United Nations — the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. And regions reach out to each other. Earlier this year, Norway acceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia. Likewise, again during the spring, China, Japan, India, the Republic of Korea and Singapore all joined the Arctic Council as observers. In doing so, they subscribed to the founding principles of the Arctic Council, principles that, yet again, are a direct reflection of a key a United Nations norm.Where I live, we observe global warming at close quarters. As the polar ice cap melts, we are reminded of our shared responsibility for saving the planets climate. Today, the Arctic Ocean is opening up to human activities in ways hard to imagine only a few years ago. Over the past decade, we have strived to develop forward-looking strategies for the safe management of the new maritime crossroads between Asia, Europe and North America. The emergence of regional institutions as a feature of global governance is in fact good news for the United Nations. We need a United Nations that can be a catalyst that supports and encourages regional developments, which — and as long as — they reinforce our common global and multilateral agenda. We must acknowledge that trend. We must revisit the Charter of the United Nations, in particular its Chapters VI and VIII, and seek to identify the opportunities and potential pitfalls it represents for the United Nations. The Middle East has yet to find an effective regional architecture. It is also a part of the world that is causing considerable concern these days. Israel and Palestine are facing a moment of truth. This month marks 20 years since the signing of the Oslo Accords. We have witnessed positive achievements on the ground. State institutions have been built and are ready for statehood. But for many years, a political horizon has been missing. Time is running out for a negotiated two-State solution.But now, as Palestinian and Israeli leaders have returned to negotiations, hope is renewed. This afternoon, in the Conference Building, I presided over a meeting of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee for the Coordination of the International Assistance to Palestinians, the international donor group for Palestine. The donors reaffirmed their commitment to providing necessary assistance to the Palestinian Authority through the current transition to statehood. It was only after the past centurys two horrific wars that my own continent chose close integration. That was instrumental in the creation of a peaceful Europe. For that historic achievement, the European Union was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo last year. The African Union (AU) has seen its continent through 50 transformative years. Freedom came at a high price. Yet, Africa has never been more prosperous than it is today. We see economic growth, improving governance and enhanced regional cooperation.From Somalia to Mali, the African Union and its subregional partners continue to prove their relevance. The African Union is, beyond doubt, becoming one of the United Nations most important regional partners. I commend the AU for its dedicated efforts, and I want to express my deepest condolences for the tragic loss of life in the heinous terrorist attacks in Nairobi. We must never allow terrorists to set the agenda. Hence our efforts to work with the AU to promote peace and stability in Somalia at this crucial moment must be redoubled.In recent years, Norway has worked with the people of Colombia to lay the foundations for lasting peace between its Government and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia movement. In doing so, we have seen the strong commitment of Colombias neighbours. There, as everywhere else, we have learned that peace cannot just be established within one country alone; it has to be rooted in a regional context.In South-East Asia, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is becoming the source, as well as an architect, of regional stability. I commend ASEAN for its constructive role in supporting the democratic reform process in Myanmar. Myanmar will even preside over ASEAN next year, which in many ways is a testimony to the organizations adaptability.Organizations such as ASEAN have also taken upon themselves the development of multilateral responses to regional challenges, including those pertaining to maritime security. Those strides are not only of regional importance, but are important to us all. The freedom and safety of the seas is one of the most important public goods in an interconnected world. Just like in South-East Asia, Norway and our fellow Arctic States have built our deepened maritime cooperation on one of the most salient organizing of human security have placed new issues on the agenda. Children and armed conflict, women, peace and security and the protection of civilians are recent examples of the important normative role of the United Nations.Faced with a scarcity of resources accentuated by a global economy under pressure, we should increase, not decrease, the f lexibility of the Secretariat and the Secretary-General to run the Organization. In autumn of 2012, the Assembly decided that the 2014-2015 budget should be cut by $100 million. Reducing the budget while increasing the number of tasks is a recipe for a weaker, not a stronger, United Nations. The Assembly must be coherent in its policies. The role of the Assembly should be to provide guidance, not to micromanage.In conclusion, to meet the regional and global challenges of our time, we, the Member States, must work together to fulfil the aspirations and potential of the Charter of the United Nations. The efficiency of this great Organization depends upon its ability to innovate and to adapt to changing circumstances"}}
