{"speech":{"0":" Allow me to congratulate the President of the General Assembly on his election to serve during the sixty-eighth session of the Assembly. I repose full confidence in him to steer the deliberations of the Assembly to a fruitful conclusion, and I assure him of our full cooperation in the discharge of his important responsibilities.I take this opportunity to extend my sincere thanks to the outgoing President, Mr. Vuk Jeremic, for having successfully presided over the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I would like to express my sincere appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his able and visionary leadership and excellent reports on issues before the Assembly.I bring with me a message of peace and non-violence from Lumbini, the birthplace of Gautama Buddha, the apostle of peace, and the greetings and best wishes of the Government and people of Nepal. Nepal has unflinching faith in the principles and purposes of the United Nations as enshrined in its Charter. Nepal upholds the centrality and indispensability of the United Nations in forging global peace and security, development and human freedom, as well as its role in the promotion of multilateralism, befitting the needs of our age.It is an irony that one eighth of the world population has to live without enough food at a time when 150 per cent of the Earths annual regenerative capacity is being consumed, and that nearly 1 billion people will still be forced to live in extreme poverty in 2015. Looking at this unfair and unjust scenario, one can hardly envision global sustainability without a system of economic growth and development that ensures the progress and and other members of the Quartet will continue to play their role as honest brokers in the process. Only with peace can there be development and dignity for the Palestinian people.Finally, we should continue to focus on building stronger and more prosperous societies predicated on the rule of law and the practice of democracy. The Arab Spring showed that the Muslim world is crying out for change. Governments must answer that call. We must provide good governance to fight corruption, create jobs to tackle poverty, and deliver sustainable growth that builds a world of opportunity for our citizens. We must create economies in which people can fulfil their own aspirations, not those of extremists.By acting to solve our most difficult political problems, we can bring an end to the immediate suffering in Syria, in Palestine and in the wider world. By committing to the cause of moderation, Muslims can secure something even greater. We can reclaim our religion, choosing harmony and acceptance over division and conflict, and we can broadcast a vision of Islam as it is understood by Muslims around the world â€” as a religion of peace, tolerance and moderation.Last month, when militants attacked those buses in Pakistan, a 19 year-old Sunni student named Ghulam Mustafa stood up for such a vision. Confronting the Sunni gunmen, he said killing Shiites was wrong. Ghulam was shot dead, but his life was not lost in vain. With guns to their heads, the Sunnis on the bus refused to identify the Shia passengers whom the gunmen wanted to kill. In their defiance, we see the true measure of courage and the true test of faith. Under unimaginable pressure, facing the greatest possible threat, they chose to stand with their brothers and sisters. They chose unity over division. Faced with unimaginable pressure, and the greatest possible threat, we must summon the will to do the same."}}
