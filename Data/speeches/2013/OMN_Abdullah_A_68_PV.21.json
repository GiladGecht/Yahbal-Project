{"speech":{"0":" It gives me great pleasure, at the outset, to extend my warmest congratulations to the President and his friendly country, Antigua and Barbuda, on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. We wish him every success in his endeavour and assure him that the Sultanate of Oman stands ready to cooperate with him and all delegations and Member States to achieve the desired objectives.We would like to take this opportunity to express our thanks and appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremic, of the friendly Republic of Serbia, for the outstanding manner in which he conducted the work of the previous session, as well as to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for all his efforts to enhance the role of the Organization and develop its operational mechanisms to respond to current challenges and recent developments and ensure optimal future preparedness.The numerous achievements and successes of the United Nations since its establishment, in 1945, Review Conference, owing to the fact that some parties did not support its convening. That reflects a lack of understanding of the conditions, objectives and aspirations of the peoples of the Middle East region.In the light of our commitment to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, we would like to announce that we have attained the Goals and all their indicators. In fact, we recently announced that we had been 100 per cent successful in achieving Goals 4 and 5.With regard to protection of the environment and natural conservation, since the dawn of the renaissance led by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said, my country, in line with the national strategy to protect the environment, has consistently integrated environmental issues into its plans and development goals, with a view to achieving a balance between the aims of sustainable development and the preservation of the environment.My country has also sought to share its interests in the environment and natural conservation with the international community. We have participated in many regional and international conferences on the environment, including the eighteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Qatar in December 2012. We look forward to participating in the nineteenth session, to be held in Warsaw in November.The right to science and knowledge should be enjoyed by all humankind, and the great evolution in the use and application of modern technology has become an essential tool in our daily lives, thanks to scientific and intellectual creativity. Consequently, my country has sought to keep up with advances to meet our current needs. To that end, we have established many centres and councils that encourage research and development, including the Scientific Research Council, the Industrial Innovation Centre, the National Centre for Enterprises and Commercial Activities, and the Oasis of Knowledge. We also have a Middle East Desalination Research Centre.My country continues to develop the main guidelines for a national strategy of research and development and scientific knowledge. We are also trying to familiarize ourselves with modern technology and to encourage Omani youth to take part in different science — and technology-based professions. In that context, we welcome future constructive cooperation, of Somalia will be able to implement the political and economic reform programme that has gained the support of the international community.Among the important international issues that have yet to be resolved is the Palestinian question, which is considered the cornerstone of any possible peace in the Middle East. Despite the efforts made and the agreements concluded through direct negotiations between successive Israeli Governments and the Palestine Liberation Organization, no settlement has yet been reached. In that regard, my country supports the efforts of President Barack Obama and his Secretary of State, Mr. John Kerry, as they represent an opportunity for all the peoples of the region to establish peace. That would lead to economic and social development and revive the hope for peaceful coexistence among the peoples of the region — all of which would ensure a positive contribution by the Middle East to global civilization.My country continues to support the initiatives aimed at transforming the Middle East into a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, as it is fully aware of the effects of those weapons on the security and stability of States, regions and the entire world.With our emphasis on the right of States to benefit from the peaceful use of nuclear energy, it is worth mentioning that the current dispute will not be resolved through coercive policies and practices, such as sanctions and other tough measures. Because those measures are limited, their effectiveness is weakened. Rather, creative diplomacy can help all States to benefit from nuclear power for peaceful purposes.On the other hand, we hope that the international community, particularly the depositary countries of the NPT, will be able to persuade other Middle Eastern States to become parties to the Treaty and to subject their nuclear facilities to the comprehensive system of safeguards that exists under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. That would contribute to achieving the universality of the Treaty and would make the Middle East a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. That goal deserves the support of all countries, especially the major Powers.We express our regret at the non-convening of the international conference on the Middle East mandated by the decision of the 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty Some of the greatest achievements of the United Nations are in the field of international law. Within these walls, the history of international relations continues to be written and brave new steps to be taken. The latest accomplishment is the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty. Iceland is proud to have been the first State to ratify this landmark treaty. We call on all States — in particular arms exporters — to do so as well, so that it enters into force without delay.In the year 2000, world leaders gathered in this city and made a historic decision by adopting the Millennium Declaration. Since then, the Millennium Development Goals have served us well. For almost 15 years, they have influenced and guided the development priorities of nations and organizations. They have increased awareness of heartbreaking poverty and inspired new policymaking. The Millennium Development Goals are indeed central to Icelands development policy, and my Government is firmly committed to shouldering our responsibility in a globalized world. As new goals are defined, the focus should remain on eliminating poverty, achieving gender equality, improving health and providing education for girls and boys.The pressure on our ecosystem calls for urgent action to combat pollution and land degradation, as well as a balanced consideration of conservation and the utilization of natural resources. It is a challenge to ensure food security when land and water resources are threatened. Our duty is to share experiences and know-how to restore land and improve land management — to change deserts into blooming fields.Furthermore, climate change and disasters such as the one in Fukushima have taught us that a real energy transformation is needed. Safe, clean and renewable energy is the way of the future. Iceland has undergone a true energy revolution. Today, almost all of our electricity and heating needs are met with renewable energy. That success story is a source of a productive partnership between Iceland and the United Nations, and now also the World Bank.Our world is wealthy. That wealth is not only preserved in the minerals of the Earth, the power of the rivers and the rich living marine resources. Our greatest wealth is people — the knowledge, the experiences, the constant journey of the human mind to explore and invent new solutions.Iceland makes use of those assets in its development cooperation. We are proud to offer the world our investment and partnerships with all other centres, universities, institutions and specialized industries in both the public and the private sectors and at the national, regional and international levels. We also want to take advantage of Omans geographical position as a main gateway and bridge to knowledge and creativity in regional and international markets.In conclusion, we wish the President every success at this session, and we hope that it concludes with a realistic and renewed vision — an inspired vision and one that also imparts new momentum for our times, a vision that reflects the aspirations of every generation and every people and makes every effort to achieve them."}}
