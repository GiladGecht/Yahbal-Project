{"speech":{"0":" I stand here today before the Assembly, soon after my country has seen a new dawn. I come to this Hall in all humility as the elected Prime Minister of Pakistan for the third time. I feel exonerated, as my supporters and I have stood firm in our commitment to democracy.I am happy to inform representatives that we now have a strong Parliament, an independent judiciary, a free media and a vibrant civil society. But there is no room for complacency. We cannot lower our guard. Democracy needs constant vigilance and strong institutions. It needs careful nurturing. More importantly, it is not promises but good governance that sustains democracy. My Government has put the people at the centre. We will work to give them peace and security, an environment of growth and development. I am pursuing an inclusive approach for the entire nation.Pakistan is an ardent supporter of the United Nations, which is an anchor of peace and a beacon of hope for all nations. The United Nations universal character provides a forum to discuss, develop and implement global responses to the pressing problems of our times. Pakistan upholds international law and promotes international consensus. The security of our world is ensured and reinforced by friendly relations among nations and respect for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of States.The United Nations needs reform, but it should be a reform that reflects the interests of all, not just the ambitions of a few. We believe that the Security Councils composition should be made more representative, democratic and equitable, and its work more effective, transparent and accountable. The intended reforms must, however, plan for a dynamic future, not entrench or replicate outdated historical patterns based on privileges. The role and authority of the General Assembly must be fully restored and revitalized. In the past few years, the General Assembly has regained influence in responding to challenges in regard to peace and security, development and climate Acceptance of the Geneva communique (, annex) and a decision on dates for convening a Geneva II conference will be a big step towards ending the crisis in Syria. I call on all forces to invest their political will and capital in diplomacy to bring peace to that country.As a responsible nuclear-weapon State, we will continue to pursue the goals of disarmament and non-proliferation and adhere to a policy of credible minimum deterrence without entering into any arms race. We cannot, however, remain oblivious to the evolving security dynamics in South Asia, nor can we agree to an arrangement that is detrimental to our security and strategic interests. Our position on the proposed fissile material treaty is determined by our national security interests and the objective of strategic stability in South Asia.The safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear energy, without discrimination, is essential for economic development. Pakistan qualifies for full access to civil nuclear technology for peaceful purposes in order to meet its growing energy needs for continued economic growth. By the same token, as a mainstream partner in the global non-proliferation regime, Pakistan has impeccable credentials for joining the multilateral export control regime, including the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Pakistan will continue to participate constructively in the Nuclear Security Summit, which is a laudable initiative.As a country that has suffered grievously for many years from terrorism, we condemn that phenomenon in all its forms and manifestations. Over the past 12 years, we have made huge sacrifices in blood and resources. We have lost 40,000 precious lives of men, women and children, including 8,000 defence and security personnel. There has been colossal damage to our social and physical infrastructure, too. Our economy has been denied the opportunity to grow fully. That must change now. I have tried to forge national consensus on a cohesive policy to eliminate terrorism from our soil. For that purpose, I convened an all-parties conference that spoke out unanimously against terrorism. We are resolved to oppose the forces of terrorism with every means at our disposal. At the same time, we have offered dialogue to end violence, wean young extremists off extremism and integrate all segments of our society into the national mainstream. Winning young peoples hearts and minds is as important as using guns to deter terrorism. But dialogue should not be seen as a sign of weakness or a tool of appeasement.to national reconciliation. I assured President Karzai that we do not wish to interfere in Afghanistans internal affairs; nor do we have any favourites in that country. In fact, we hope earnestly that the Afghans themselves will unite for the peace, prosperity and development of their great country.Pakistan encourages United Nations efforts to stabilize Afghanistan. We will work together with Afghanistan for regional and economic cooperation aimed at establishing and reinforcing regional trade, energy and communications corridors. Our solidarity with the Afghan people has been demonstrated through our willingness to host millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan for many decades. International support for their repatriation to and reintegration in Afghanistan is indispensable. We also look forward to United Nations support for addressing other transregional challenges, including the f low of narcotics.Last year, the Assembly gave Palestine the status of non-Member observer State. We hope that it will soon join this body as a full Member State. We are glad that the stalled peace process has started again. It should lead to the consolidation of an independent, viable and contiguous State of Palestine, based on the pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Pakistan will continue to demonstrate its solidarity with the people of Palestine.Even as we meet here, Syria is in turmoil, with Syrians killing Syrians. We appeal to the Syrian Government and the opposition groups to move to the negotiating table in Geneva to prepare a road map for national reconciliation and the necessary political transitions. More war will lead to more killings, which must be stopped. As a party to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, Pakistan remains opposed to the use of chemical weapons. We condemn their use in the strongest terms.We welcome the agreement reached between the United States and Russia, and supported by the other permanent members of the Security Council, to secure and destroy chemical weapons in Syria. That crucial step has facilitated consensus within the Council to adopt resolution 2118 (2013), which not only addresses the issue of chemical weapons but could start the stalled political process in Syria, leading to national reconciliation and solutions that are acceptable to the people of Syria. Pakistan will support that resolution. not aid but enhanced trade, market access, investment and strong economic partnerships.We are creating a new framework for change to provide equal opportunities and social justice for everyone, eliminate the exploitation of the poor, harness our human resources and restore the dignity of our citizens. We intend to use education as a key driver of the socioeconomic development of Pakistan. We are introducing a national health service across Pakistan with the participation of the private sector. We have also made the eradication of polio in Pakistan a matter of great importance for my Government, as we are determined to make Pakistan a polio-free country.It is our strong resolve to promote the full participation of women in national development, while protecting their political, social and cultural rights as agents of change. More than 63 per cent of our population is under the age of 25. By investing in their education and skills, we aim to tap into the demographic dividend. Minorities are equal citizens of Pakistan. They will not only have complete freedom to worship, but also full protection of their rights to education, employment and political participation.We are deeply saddened by the recent terrorist attack on the members of a minority community in Peshawar. That heinous attack has united the entire Pakistani nation in support of our brothers and sisters of all faiths in Pakistan. We share their grief and have declared three days of mourning. The attack was carried out by the same elements who have attacked our mosques, shrines, innocent citizens and members of our security forces. However, the attack has further strengthened my Governments resolve to deal with terrorism and extremism in a resolute and comprehensive manner, as I reiterated in my very first speech at the National Assembly of Pakistan.In conclusion, I wish to emphasize to the Assembly that Pakistan is a strong supporter of multilateral diplomacy, convinced that it is the most legitimate and ultimate guarantor of peace and security, economic and social development, and respect for universal human rights. As a non-permanent member of the Security Council, Pakistan has been making every effort to strengthen the role of diplomacy to resolve conflicts and to help build States in post-conflict situations. In all instances, we have upheld the primacy of the Charter of the United Nations. We need multilateral diplomacy so that we continue to respect diversity while reaching The war against terrorism must be waged within the framework of international law. The use of armed drones in the border areas of Pakistan is a continued violation of our territorial integrity. It results in innocent civilian casualties and is detrimental to our resolve and efforts to eliminate extremism and terrorism in Pakistan. I have urged the United States to cease those strikes so that we can avoid further casualties and suffering.Terrorism knows no borders. It has no religion or creed, which is why maligning a whole people or a religion on that account is unfair and unwise. Islam is a religion of peace, compassion and brotherhood. And the yet most insidious form of contemporary racism in the name of religion is on the rise. Peaceful Muslim communities are profiled and subjected to discriminatory practices. Their faith, culture, holy personalities and scriptures are under attack. The stereotyping of Muslims as extremists and terrorists must stop. We must all use the influence and reach of the United Nations to avert a clash of civilizations and to promote harmony among followers of diverse religions all around the world. Terrorism negates Islams humanistic outlook and noble values. Those who perpetrate terrorism are enemies of Muslims and Islam itself.Pakistan is the largest troop contributor to United Nations peacekeeping. Since 1960, we have contributed 150,000 troops, and 135 of our peacekeepers have lost their lives in the service of peace. That has been our most tangible assistance to the United Nations efforts to maintain international peace and security.We fully support the United Nations effort to finalize and implement a single, coherent post-2015 development agenda that identifies benchmarks for poverty alleviation, sustainable development and social inclusion. More importantly, we should prepare ourselves to respond effectively to save our planet from the ravages of climate change.Our Government is undertaking an economic revolution in Pakistan so that it, too, can become part of the emerging markets. We have all the fundamentals and human and natural resources for such a transformation. In the immediate future, our challenge is to overcome a volatile security environment, correct structural imbalances in the economy and bring an end to energy shortages. We are building a new Pakistan with a robust economy. From the international community, we seek programme of the various committees and agencies of this body.Sir, Saint Kitts and Nevis wishes to place on record its appreciation to your predecessor, the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, Mr. Vuk Jeremic, for the important contributions that he made to advance the work of the institution during his own tenure.We begin the sixty-eighth session fully cognizant of the diverse challenges with which we must contend, and equally seized of our obligation as a Government and people to contribute to the global priorities that inform the work of the Assembly. We see the relevance of maintaining sharp focus on those areas that are quite integral to the national and international development agendas. I refer to matters such as sustainable development, the maintenance of international peace and security, the promotion of human rights, disarmament, the promotion of justice and international law, and the effective coordination of humanitarian assistance efforts. Those, we believe, are the core principles for informing any plan of action to advance towards the post-2015 era with the confidence that our shared vision for meeting the goals we set, will be realized.Just a few days ago, Saint Kitts and Nevis attained another milestone, celebrating three decades of nationhood with a very strong commitment to maintaining the stability and prosperity of our nation, drawing on our own creativity as a Government and a people. Therefore, this years statement is very significant for our proud nation. As one of the smallest States Members of the Organization in the western hemisphere, we are pleased with the significant strides that we have made as my Government pursues a process of transformation for sustainability in a nation that is not immune to global developments that continue to have a negative impact on its national agenda.However, my Government is working assiduously to transform our former sugar-based economy into one that is service-oriented, driven mainly by tourism and hospitality and supported by international financial and offshore education services and by manufacturing and agriculture. In all of this, we are aware of the momentum and impact of information and communication technology as a tool that will assist us in developing our national economy.As far as the manufacturing sector is concerned, we have developed a cluster of light manufacturing decisions that impact our fate as members of the international community. Towards that end, the United Nations — the virtual world parliament — is our best hope."}}
