{"speech":{"0":" I am pleased to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session, and to welcome the fact that this lofty responsibility has been entrusted to a dear friend from Antigua and Barbuda, a member of our community of Latin American and Caribbean States. You can count on the firm support of Peru in the execution of your work.At the outset, I wish to express our respect for and solidarity with the people of Mexico and Pakistan, who are suffering as a result of natural disasters. I also wish to express the strong rejection and condemnation of the Government and people of Peru of the terrorist attack in Nairobi. We are relieved that this horrendous attack has come to an end. We express our unwavering solidarity with the families of the victims and with the Government and people of Kenya at this difficult time.The world is changing, the agenda is realigning, new actors are emerging and new horizons are coming into view for the future of humankind. All countries and peoples are affected by such rapid transformation. However, we note with concern that some fundamental truths have not changed. Wars continue, mostly in new forms, emerging from the shadows and exacting an ever higher price from innocent populations.Regarding the Syrian tragedy, we express our solidarity with the Syrian people. Peru condemns the use of chemical weapons as unacceptable in all circumstances. It is an affront to humankind and a clear violation of international law. The Syrian people deserve an immediate solution to the bloody conflict ravaging their country. We therefore urge all parties involved to find a peaceful and negotiated solution that respects the mechanisms for the settlement of disputes. We also call on the Security Council to uphold its responsibility to maintain international peace and security.At the same time, inequality is becoming ever more extreme. The gap marginalizing the poor from the benefits of progress and development widens by the day, robbing them of the rights enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.It is crucial for us to strengthen, renew and uphold our global commitment to developing peaceful relations among peoples and to seeking solutions that reject the use of force as means of solving our problems. It is therefore particularly gratifying for Peru and a source of genuine pride that we addressed our Non-traditional exports account for one third of our total exports — more than $11 billion dollars today — and service exports account for $5 billion. We are developing our immense potential for tourism.The economic growth in recent years has been extraordinary, and I must say it has been the result of much effort, rigour and work, as well as democratic continuity and perseverance. Peru has managed both to avoid the worst effects of global instability and to attract levels of investment f lows that are unparalleled in our countrys history. Our task is to strengthen the foundations that have enabled such growth, in particular by strengthening democracy, institutions, the rule of law and security, building citizenship and opening spaces for participation.We have the means to do that, since we are a country of entrepreneurs: 98 per cent of our businesses are small or medium-sized. They employ 75 per cent of the economically active population and contribute 42 per cent of the gross domestic product. Thanks to our efforts, Peru is now considered an emerging, middle-income country, with new middle classes and a growing domestic consumption, and it is able to attract long-term investments for large projects.Thanks to that and to the extent that we have strengthened our national capacities, we will be able to encourage industrial policies geared towards changing economic and social structures. For us, industrialization is a national goal. In order to move in that direction, in December Lima will host the fifteenth General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.Being centrally located on the map of South America and having played a key role in Latin American history, Peru views its region from the perspective of a country that seeks consensus, both internal and external. Peru is a country that perceives regional integration as an effective way to improve the present and future of our security and development. We Peruvians have an overriding conviction that, on our own, we can move forward rapidly, but together we can do that better and reach farther.Peru is part of the Pacific Alliance, along with Mexico, Chile and Colombia. Together we are moving towards integration with a strategic projection towards the Asia-Pacific region and the world. In that region, which is home to the most dynamic economies of the twenty-first century, we are also part of the Asia-We are deeply concerned to note that the environment is deteriorating, which is having an impact on our security, in particular that of the most vulnerable. This is happening even as we remain unable to agree on measures to ensure our sustainable development. The development agenda must also pay particular attention to the empowerment of women and the protection of vulnerable groups. Our Government attaches particular importance to the rights of indigenous peoples. We were the first in the world to legislate and regulate the right to prior consultation on measures directly affecting such groups in accordance with Convention No. 169 of the International Labour Organization.We are equally concerned about the rights of migrants and the opportunities for integrated development, to which they contribute, fostering inter-cultural dialogue and economic exchanges between their countries of origin and their host countries. In that vein, we have promoted the free movement of people and welcome the initiative of the Government of Spain to promote visa-free entry for Peruvian nationals into the Schengen Area .We therefore welcome the commitments contained in the document “The future we want”, adopted at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development held last year (resolution , annex). The process proposed at that event to establish sustainable development goals should converge with the post-2015 development agenda, leading to the greater capacity of the Organization to contribute to solving urgent problems and dealing with development challenges. We urgently need to integrate the various separate efforts. The United Nations should have a single, comprehensive development agenda. But to do so, we need to change the equation and place the fight for equality and against inequality at the centre of our efforts. Let us not make growth an end in itself; rather, we should turn it into a tool. That is why in Peru we believe that the right formula is “inclusion for growth.” That is the direction Peru proposes for the post-2015 agenda.Peru has made a quantum leap in its economy. We are currently among the fastest-growing countries. Responsible management of our economy has helped to create 800,000 new jobs so far during my Administration and has also helped to reduce unemployment by 7 per cent. We are gradually diversifying our economy. important dimension. It also has profoundly practical repercussions for society at large. We cannot forget that a State that does not serve the entire population breeds and exacerbates inequality. As long as such degrees of inequality exist – and I will never tire of saying this - any policy aimed at combating poverty will have only relative effects.For that reason, my Administration has worked not only on economic growth but in all areas of growth. The history of my country has seen other periods of growth, but they proved to be unsustainable and benefited very few. Economic growth is a means and not an end; it is an indispensable tool, but it is not sufficient. Our people, especially those who are most forgotten, cannot wait indefinitely for growth without the State actively promoting the extension of its benefits.In addition, that will set in motion a virtuous circle in which progress for our most vulnerable countrymen and the development of a population free of extreme poverty, with health care and education for all, will create the conditions for even greater economic growth. That is why we stress the new political concept of simultaneous growth and redistribution. That is what I mean when I stress the necessity of “including so as to grow”.Two years ago, less than two months into my term as President of Peru, I stood before the Assembly to emphasize my Governments commitment to social inclusion. I said then that we were working to turn our economic growth into development and quality of life for my countrymen. I also said that we intended to hone our democracy so that it could solve the problems and meet the needs of all. The country we want is a prosperous one where all the Peruvians, women and men, without any distinction, can enjoy the benefits of growth in a dignified, safe and free manner. After two years in office, I reaffirm what I said; our commitment remains the same."}}
