{"speech":{"0":" First of all, I would like to offer my heartfelt congratulations to Mr. John Ashe for his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. In one months time, it will have been 70 years since the Foreign Ministers of the four major Powers agreed to set up a universal organization dedicated to ensuring international peace and security. In Moscow, in 1943, high representatives of the United States, the Soviet Union, China and the United Kingdom took that decision in the very midst of the most devastating war in human history. They knew that maintaining peace and the creed of “war no more” required harmonious and concerted international cooperation. They knew that it required collaboration among the great Powers and respect for the principles of international law, as well as the building of infrastructure for peace. The declaration published back then rightly spoke of the need to act for justice among nations. That is important, because it is from injustice or from the sense of a lack of justice that many conflicts, both internal and international, have originated and continue to originate.On the eve of that anniversary, it is worth examining to what extent the international community copes with threats to peace and with open-ended, prolonged disputes. The Organization and its States Members are right to be satisfied with the body of work produced since then to help maintain security and peace. The new and emerging security threats, such as climate change, climate variability, sea-level rise and ocean acidification, are challenging the international system of governance; a time in which the future survival of some nations is seriously in question; a time when all those countries with the ability to do so must contribute to the prevention of this calamity or be forever judged by history.Business as usual can no longer be considered an option. Let us not limit ourselves to working within the boundaries of our comfort zones. Let us be inclusive rather than exclusive. We must listen to civil society, our youth and womens groups and allow those with the ability to make a contribution to join in the global dialogue and action to address these major challenges.In that regard, we welcome the continued resolve of the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly to accelerate action on the reform of our Organization, to ensure the highest level of global collaboration, accountability and decisive action, and to inspire a greater sense of urgency on issues of critical concern to our global community.We also welcome the inclusion of Taiwan in the international processes of the World Health Assembly. We hope that a similar inclusive approach will prevail in respect of other international institutions and processes, so that Taiwan, and others currently excluded, can participate and contribute meaningfully for the good of humankind.Resolution calls for a frank assessment of our global decision-making structure. It requires bold but rational political commitment on a global scale. As leaders of our global family, we must be brutally honest in accepting the fact that unless we act now to shape the future we want for our children and their childrens children, the prospects for success will be bleak. As we chart the path towards the future we want, we must address the fundamental threats to the security and very existence of the members of this family of nations. Once again I call on all of us to ask ourselves the question, “Whose interests are we pursuing? Are we here to secure the future of each others children or just our own?” This is the greatest moral challenge facing us today."}}
