{"speech":{"0":" First of all, on behalf of the delegation of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, allow me to congratulate Mr. John William Ashe on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I am convinced that his competent leadership will lead this session towards success.The Millennium Summit, held in 2000, advanced peace and security, sustainable development and the protection and promotion of human rights as the three key objectives of the United Nations. Ever since the inception of the United Nations, humankind has aspired to build a new, peaceful world, free from war, while at Today in the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, the entire population is engaged in an all-out campaign to build a thriving socialist State in the nearest possible future, under the wise leadership of the dear respected Marshal Kim Jong Un. Marshal Kim Jong Un, the supreme leader of our people, gives continuous on-the-spot guidance across the country, offering direction and innovative ways for speeding up economic development and the improvement of peoples livelihoods.Practical measures are being taken, one after another, to revitalize the overall national economy, bringing about success in the fields of economic development and improving peoples welfare. Nothing is more precious than creating a stable and peaceful environment for the Government of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea and the Korean people, who helped build economic power and improved peoples livelihoods as part of the Governments overall objective. Although our efforts for peaceful development are faced with grave challenges, the Korean people will surely bring about the day of final victory by advancing with full confidence and optimism, united single-handedly around Marshal Kim Jong Un and under his wise leadership.Sixty years have passed since the gunfire that ended a fierce three-year-long war and the signing of the Armistice Agreement in the Korean peninsula last century. Yet there is still no mechanism in place to guarantee peace, resulting in the continuation of the unsustainable situation — one of neither war nor peace — on the Korean peninsula.With the aim of achieving military domination of North-East Asia, the United States, using the Korean peninsula as a stepping stone, has designated the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea as its primary target of attack and is beefing up its military presence in South Korea and the vicinity. Furthermore, it stages a series of war exercises against the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea every year, with massive build-ups of hundreds of thousands of troops and modern military equipment, continuously escalating confrontation and fuelling tensions.The United Nations Command, the outdated legacy of the Korean War, continues to serve the United States military strategy by abusing the name of the United Nations. The United Nations Command, which has nothing to do with the United Nations, continuously conducts military actions threatening the Korean including poverty reduction in particular. However, much to our regret, international efforts in that regard have not produced the long-overdue results. By identifying and successfully attaining the post-2015 sustainable development goals, practical measures need to be taken to address issues such as establishing fair international economic relations, transferring environmentally sound technology to developing countries and strengthening financial support.Despite international efforts towards the protection and promotion of human rights, high-handedness and double standards are becoming ever more visible in United Nations human rights forums, targeting developing countries as selectively as in the past. Politicization, selectivity and double standards should be put to an end in such forums, and no one should be able to justify or allow the continuation of a situation where the human rights situation in some countries is either called into question or simply ignored in accordance with the political purpose and interests of the West and Western values.The reform of the United Nations is becoming an issue that brooks no further delay in achieving the major United nations goals to which I have referred in the twenty-first century.In addressing key international issues, the General Assembly should be empowered to have the final say, since it represents the overall will of the entire membership. In particular, Security Council resolutions pertaining to peace and security, such as those on sanctions and the use of force, should be made effective only under the authority and with the approval of the General Assembly. Instances of the Council being abused by a certain State as a tool of strategic interest should never go unchallenged.Last January, under the manipulation of the United States, the forcible adoption of an unfair resolution on sanctions took place (Security Council resolution 2087 (2013)) by making an issue of our legitimate satellite launch for peaceful purposes — something that was conducted and recognized under international law. That represents a typical example of how and for what purpose the power of the Security Council is being abused. The reform of the Council, which is a key component of reforming the United Nations, should be undertaken on the basis of principles for ensuring accountability, transparency and impartiality in its activities, thereby ensuring the full representation of developing countries in its composition. outdated confrontational approach we are coming up against from the South Korean authorities risks driving relations back into a destructive stage.As clarified by the 15 June joint declaration and the 4 October declaration, the only way to achieve the peaceful reunification of the country and to open the way forward for the nation is to promote dialogue and cooperation between the North and South of Korea by joining hands in the spirit of the Korean nation itself.We will work hand in hand with anyone who truly seeks reconciliation and the reunification and prosperity of the nation. We will strive to accomplish the historic cause of national reunification through the concerted efforts of the nation under the 15 June joint declaration and the 4 October declaration.In conclusion, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea will continue to strengthen and develop friendly and cooperative relations with all States Members of the United Nations, support the placing of the situation on the Korean peninsula under stable management as a member of the international community, and fully exercise its responsibility and role in ensuring world peace and the common prosperity of humankind, pursuant to its foreign policy of ideals, independence, peace and friendship."}}
