{"speech":{"0":" As this is the first time that I take the f loor before the General Assembly, at the headquarters of international legitimacy and multilateralism, I would like to begin by reiterating Portugals firm and unwavering commitment to the United Nations, its Charter and the values and principles that guide its action.I congratulate the President on his election. His long international career and vast experience in the United Nations system have placed him in a privileged position to preside over the central organ of the Organization. His election reflects a recognition on the part of all Member States of the strong commitment to the United Palestinians must not be missed. We have a unique opportunity to find a peaceful solution on the basis of United Nations resolutions and internationally agreed parameters that establishes a sovereign, independent and viable Palestinian State and addresses Israels security concerns.Also in the Middle East, we have been following with great concern the prolonged deadlock in the search for a solution to the Iranian nuclear issue. It is regrettable that, despite all the diplomatic efforts and pressure on the part of the international community, no solid progress has been made so far. Nevertheless, we view as positive signs the recent statements made by high-ranking Iranian officials, in particular by President Hassan Rouhani here in the General Assembly (see ). I appeal to the Iranian authorities to translate those encouraging political signals into concrete steps conducive to a negotiated solution that can restore the international communitys confidence in a peaceful and civilian Iranian nuclear programme.Another issue of concern is the situation in the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, where the constitutional order has been subverted since the coup detat of 12 April 2012. As a member of the European Union, the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP) and the United Nations, and in close coordination with the Economic Community of West African States, as well as through bilateral measures, Portugal is continuing with its efforts to help the people of Guinea-Bissau overcome the current crisis. We acknowledge the work done by Special Representative of the Secretary-General Ramos-Horta to promote a dialogue among the main political actors with a view to restoring the constitutional order. The formation of an inclusive Government was, in that sense, a step forward.However, restoring constitutional order and normalizing Guinea-Bissaus relations with the international community require that presidential and legislative elections be held, in accordance with the commitments undertaken by the current Guinean authorities and as reiterated in the press statement issued by the President of the Security Council on 11 September. We are, however, very concerned about the possibility that has been raised of a new extension of the transitional period. The international community should also emphasize that for the elections to be free, fair and transparent, the current authorities must guarantee that all Guinean citizens, without exception, can participate in those elections, in full enjoyment position to reaffirm the centrality of the United Nations in solving it. With the Security Council blocked and powerless, it was the absence of the United Nations in the period when prevention and control were still possible that allowed the Syrian crisis to reach such dramatic and unacceptable political and humanitarian proportions. We would certainly have had fewer casualties and refugees, and would surely not now be dealing with a huge international crisis resulting from the use of chemical weapons. Now, when an agreement has been reached to remove the threat posed by the chemical arsenal of the Syrian regime once and for all, the international community has again turned to the Security Council.I would like to commend the enormous political and diplomatic efforts of the United States and Russia, with the involvement of Joint Special Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi. The commitment and spirit of compromise that they demonstrated in the process enabled them to arrive at an important agreement and the adoption yesterday of Security Council resolution 2118 (2013), which, hopefully, will ensure its implementation. The Security Council, in close collaboration with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, has assumed its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations, finally creating a prospect for hope for a global political solution to the Syrian issue. It is now essential that we seize the opportunity created by the initiative on chemical weapons to consolidate the political-diplomatic track and hold the “Geneva II” conference. Nevertheless, the primary responsibility for resolving the Syrian crisis lies with the parties to the conflict. Without their will and commitment, no political solution is possible. The international community must keep up the pressure on the parties, particularly the Damascus regime, with a view to achieving a peaceful and sustainable democratic future in which every sector of Syrian society feels represented.The Middle East has also seen some positive recent developments with the resumption of the peace process between Israel and Palestine. I would like to reaffirm before the Assembly Portugals full support for that process. I congratulate the United States of America on its initiative and applaud the Palestinian and Israeli authorities for the courage and leadership shown in their decision to resume negotiations. There can be no lasting peace, stability or security in the Middle East unless the question of Palestine is settled. The present opportunity to ensure security for all and justice, finally, for the But we need a broader, more inclusive and strategic vision. We must go beyond the traditional relationship between donors and recipients to create partnerships that involve new international actors. For Portugal, different modalities of assistance, new sources of financing and a strengthened principle of shared responsibility, leadership and ownership on the part of developing countries are the main guiding principles for the post-2015 development agenda. The inaugural meeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development was politically highly significant. Portugal remains committed to ensuring that the Forum acts as a catalyst for international efforts, ensuring a more efficient and coherent link between the various processes in the area of sustainable development and poverty eradication.In the context of the outcome of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, I would like to stress the importance of progress on the issue of oceans, which is a crucial matter for a maritime country like Portugal. We welcome Member States commitment to discussing the issue of the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction. In this context, Portugal is strongly in favour of the negotiation and adoption of an international instrument in the framework of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.Reforms and institutional innovations such as those I have just mentioned represent important changes in the architecture of the United Nations, adapting and preparing it for new times and new challenges. However, the reform of our Organization will never be complete without Security Council reform, including of its working methods and, above all, of its composition. It is increasingly difficult to justify why countries such as Brazil and India are not permanent members of the Security Council. As stated on previous occasions, Portugal is of the view that Africa also deserves permanent representation in that body. It is imperative that Africa be treated in a way that is just and reflects its size, economic growth and its weight in todays world.I take this opportunity to congratulate the African Union and its member States on the fiftieth anniversary of the continents regional organization.Portugal firmly believes in multilateralism and in the United Nations as the centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends. We contribute actively to the work of our Organization through a committed participation in its bodies, but we of their rights, including the rights of the freedoms of speech and association. Only a new Government that enjoys the legitimacy conferred by a free popular vote and is appointed in accordance with the Constitution can promote long-overdue reforms in the security, administration and justice sectors.The crisis in Guinea-Bissau also has clear and worrying connections with the Sahel region through drug-trafficking routes. Europe, and especially its southern countries, is following the situation in the Sahel with particular concern. I can assure the Assembly that we will continue to make every effort to help stabilize the region. In that context, the United Nations integrated strategy for the Sahel represents a major contribution.Portugal is currently co-President of the Western Mediterranean forum known as the 5+5 initiative, which brings together 10 countries on the northern and southern Mediterranean coasts. The dialogue and confidence-building that that informal instrument provides represents important added value for its members and the region. We are therefore engaged in exploring all of its potential for cooperation.The Charter of the United Nations defends the importance of using international mechanisms to promote the economic and social advancement of all peoples. In the noble spirit of the United Nations and following the historic and inspiring launch in 2000 of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the current session of the General Assembly will be a critical launching pad for defining our priorities and the path we will follow in our common efforts towards the 2015 summit at which we will adopt our development principles and goals for the coming years.I commend the President for the timeliness of his choice of theme for this general debate, “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. On 25 September, I had an opportunity to participate in the special event on the Millennium Development Goals, which enabled us to thoroughly discuss the progress achieved to date on the MDGs and provide important guidance for our future work. It is our conviction that the set of MDGs should serve as the reference point for establishing the new development agenda, which should maintain a focus on poverty reduction and sustainable development in all its dimensions, while giving special attention to the needs of least developed countries.
