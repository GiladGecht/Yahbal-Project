{"speech":{"0":" As President of the Republic of Paraguay, I have the great honour to speak in this global forum to address issues that are relevant to my country and to todays world in general.I extend a special greeting to the President of the Assembly, Ambassador John Ashe, as well as to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, in appreciation of their work towards the noble goals that unite us. Through their efforts, they contribute to the legitimacy of the United Nations and help to ensure multilateral cooperation and the international validity of the rule of law.It has been little more than a month since I took office as President of the Republic of Paraguay, after an exemplary electoral process that culminated on 21 April, when the Paraguayan people went to the polls to freely exercise their guaranteed constitutional right to elect their Government, with irrefutable results. Electoral observer missions from various regional and continental organizations, and from the United Nations itself, were present and certified the legality, legitimacy and transparency of the elections and the electoral signatory of recognized international instruments in that field.The demands of landlocked developing countries like Paraguay must be adequately addressed. Apart from that, my Government is committed to overcome the disadvantages posed by our inland status, making our geographic position an advantage in communications, logistics and infrastructure that connects the worlds zones and regions through Paraguayan territory. In a manner similar to that in which an old border dispute between Paraguay and Brazil finally gave way to what today is Itaipu, transforming a problem into a majestic work of integration and development, we hope that our landlocked position in the heart of Latin America will serve as a development hub for Paraguay and its neighbours.On the international level, I cannot avoid mentioning the upheavals that disturb our times. Economic crises, financial disasters, civil wars and the use of weapons of mass destruction cloud the horizons of great regions of the planet. The events in Syria are a concern for all of us, and the United Nations must play a pre-eminent role in finding a definitive solution to the conflict affecting that country. In that regard, my country calls for supporting the implementation of the framework agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation.My Government has observed with satisfaction that the Republic of China on Taiwan has achieved a greater presence in the specialized agencies and bodies of the United Nations, thanks to solid international support and a rapprochement between both parties on the Taiwan Strait. My Government will continue to encourage the positive interaction between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in the international sphere.The calm and determination of the nations and the organizations able to help in conflict resolution are more necessary than ever. Paraguay encourages peace, dialogue and development in harmony with the other countries and the world, promoting an integration that is respectful of the rule of law, the dignity of nations and the asymmetries. Integration is a phenomenon that in this global era cannot be halted. Paraguay understands and promotes integration in conditions of equality as a means for supranational insertion, but under fair conditions and looking towards a common future, not as a simple courting of Powers or being a silent guest encouraging. Paraguay is clearly suited to investment. Nature has endowed my country with an enviable climate, more than 90 rivers, abundant and fertile soil and clean, renewable energy generated by three hydroelectric power plants. One, Acaray, is entirely Paraguayan-owned, while Itaipu and Yacyreta are co-owned with Brazil and Argentina, respectively. The latter are among the largest hydroelectric plants in the world. We have one of the worlds largest freshwater reserves, the Guarani Aquifer, a great part of which lies beneath Paraguayan territory.Apart from the advantages of nature and abundant, clean and renewable energy, the majority of Paraguays population is young, with more than 75 per cent under the age of 30. Our tax system is favourable to investment and our economic growth clearly exceeds the average for the region. My Government is committed to ensuring legal security, with clear and transparent rules for safeguarding people and their property.Today we are a country with a revitalized economy and a focus on efficiency, transparency and a reliable public administration. A few weeks ago I was present in our Congress at the signing of an agreement for Paraguay, whereby the political parties represented in the legislature, along with other social institutions, committed to working together on framework agreements and plans of action to strengthen governance and attain material and spiritual goals for the peoples welfare. In that way, we are seeking to maintain the general good over that of the individual. We do that through dialogue, which is the main instrument of democracy. Together, we assume the responsibility of making Paraguay a country of opportunity for all.After visiting countries in Europe and the Americas recently, I ref lect on the great challenge posed by the perception of my country beyond its borders. I have seen with satisfaction the respect, admiration and interest that Paraguay and its enormous potential give rise to. Just as it is our responsibility as Paraguayans to build predictability and reliability, it is for the branches of the Government to provide the legal security necessary for Paraguays overdue progress.I would like to underline my Governments commitment to the defence and promotion of human rights, which in Paraguay are fully acknowledged in the Constitution. We assume that stance out of genuine conviction, while my country is also a respectful govern the world therefore represent an access to the ocean of development.Speaking before the Assembly and the world for the first time as President of the Republic of Paraguay, I present the new direction that the Paraguayan people freely and sovereignly chose on 21 April. I belong to a nation whose children have contributed to history with their prowess and boundless sacrifice, such as the supreme sacrifice by our greatest hero, Francisco Solano Lopez, Field Marshal and President of the Republic, who decided to give his life, sword in hand, fighting on the front lines with his last soldiers, rather than see his homeland humiliated. I have decided to devote myself to the service of Paraguay and to bring about the real change that my country demands, which is to return to the path of the true Paraguayan destiny of peace, development and modernity, and to grow in harmony with all nations of the world, particularly with our neighbours.I assure the General Assembly that my country is a very generous and attractive place. I invite the world to learn more about Paraguay, to discover the treasure that pulses in the heart of America, ready to write anew the most glorious pages in its history, today in peace and social and economic development, with dignity and readiness to welcome all those who wish to share in our great destiny.We Heads of State are transients in Government. History will judge us for what we have done for our peoples and will sternly hold us accountable for what we have failed to do. To honour the trust and hope of my people, I have decided to commit myself wholly to the service of my homeland and to do everything necessary for its greatness and prosperity.Paraguay considers it necessary, more than ever before, to give greater impetus to the negotiating process between Israel and Palestine in order to attain a lasting peace, so that Israel and Palestine can live side by side with secure borders and in peace. As a final comment, I wish to convey my most sincere condolences to the people of Kenya for the casualties that resulted from the terrorist attack, an act that we most vigorously condemn."}}
