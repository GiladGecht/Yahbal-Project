{"speech":{"0":" International relations are becoming increasingly complex and multidimensional, while developments in the world are even more rapid and less predictable. Under these circumstances as never before, there is an urgent need to agree upon collective responses to the key issues of today. It is solely within the power of such a truly universal Organization as the United Nations to do so. Moreover, such solidarity-based efforts will be productive only if they reflect the entire spectrum of views of the international community on global challenges and threats, a broad range of historical experiences and the full cultural and civilizational diversity of the modern world.For most of the Members of the United Nations family, that approach is axiomatic. However, there is also another tendency whereby collective actions are understood primarily as agreement with the viewpoint of one group of countries. Such views manifest themselves in various areas: international security, the settlement of conflict situations, the functioning of the world economy, and the choice of development models and core values.Many problems affecting todays world are reflected in the tragic situation in Syria and in the uncertainty surrounding the development of events in the Middle East and North Africa overall. From the very onset of the turmoil in that region, Russia has consistently called for the development by the international community of a common approach combining support for the Arab peoples on their path to transformation with People are continuing to die and innocent civilians to suffer every day in Syria. Religious minorities, including Christian communities, are becoming victims of the conflict, which is increasingly acquiring a sectarian character. Virtually the only possibility remaining today to put an end to this turmoil is to break the deadlock regarding the process of a political settlement of the Syrian crisis. We continue to work tirelessly for the earliest convening of a peace conference to implement the Geneva communique of 30 July 2012 (, annex). We hope that, following the example set by the Government of Syria, the opposition will also constructively respond to the Russia-United States initiative.The Syrian crisis should not overshadow the need to address the Palestinian problem. We expect the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to shoulder their responsibility for the future of their people at this current critical stage, where the parties have resumed direct talks after a lengthy interruption. While duly recognizing the efforts made by the United States in the Middle East settlement process, we deem it necessary to intensify the activity of the Quartet, the internationally recognized mechanism for providing assistance to the peace process in the region on the basis of the relevant decisions of the United Nations, the Madrid principles and the Arab Peace Initiative. It is also important to ensure the close involvement of the Arab countries in the activities of the Quartet.Approaches based on negotiation are also required with respect to other situations, including the Iranian nuclear programme and the nuclear problem in the Korean peninsula. As President Vladimir Putin noted in his recent article in the 11 September 2013 issue of The New York Times,“We must stop using the language of force and return to the path of civilized diplomatic and political settlement.”This would help to improve the international environment and contribute to stepping up collective efforts to counter global challenges, including terrorism and drug trafficking. Russia intends to attach priority attention to these challenges during its presidency of the Group of Eight, in 2014.Today, when the rigid frame of the bipolar system has been long relegated to the past, a mark of the time is the strengthening of the democratic foundations both within States and in international relations. That means Recently a common argument has been increasingly made to the effect that the threat or use of force, directly prohibited by the Charter of the United Nations, is virtually the most effective method of addressing international problems, including the settlement of domestic conflicts. There have been attempts to extrapolate such an approach to the situation in Syria as well, despite the fact that recent experience with such interventions has proved that they are ineffective, meaningless and destructive. That is an extremely dangerous path leading to the erosion of the foundations of todays world order and the subversion of the weapons of mass destruction non-proliferation regimes.It is alarming to hear statements about the right to use military force to ensure ones own interests in the Middle East region under the pretext of a persistent leadership gap in the international arena. Recent history shows that no State, no matter how big or powerful, can cope alone with challenges of the scope faced by humankind today.There is no doubt that leadership is required. However, today it can only be collective leadership based on agreed actions of the leading members of the international community, with strict respect for the principles and norms of international law. It is the growing understanding of that reality that has opened the way towards achieving Russia-United States understandings relating to the placing under international control and subsequent elimination of the Syrian chemical arsenals. That became possible thanks to the decision by Damascus to join the Chemical Weapons Convention and fulfil the relevant obligations following the expedited procedure.We expect that the decisions of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Executive Council and the Security Council will contribute to creating the framework required for the elimination of chemical arsenals in Syria.Progress in the area of chemical disarmament in Syria should give impetus to the implementation of existing arrangements to convene a conference on establishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery in the Middle East. We know that there are a number of complicated issues related to ensuring full participation of the countries of the region in such a conference, but they cannot be discussed endlessly. That is exactly when true leadership and resolve must be demonstrated for the common benefit. "}}
