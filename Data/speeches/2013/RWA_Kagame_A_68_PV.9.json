{"speech":{"0":" Thirteen years ago, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) established humanitarian principles for the twenty-first century. Together, Member States and international organizations stood for the idea that the worlds poorest nations and poorest people should not have to live without dignity and hope.The world is a different place now. We have witnessed the struggles of a global economy reeling from a financial crisis and, indeed, a recession. But we have seen a billion people lifted out of poverty, more children in schools, greater care for the sick. And we have observed a generation born in a new age of information, ready to embrace ever-expanding frontiers of technology.But the transformative effect is not yet complete. The list of shortcomings is as long as that of the successes, and as we think about the theme of “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”, we must have the courage to go beyond business as usual. The report of the High-level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through Sustainable Development, has laid out an ambitious vision for the future, and I congratulate the eminent persons who worked to produce it.But together we must now take an honest look at the MDGs, determine what worked and what did not, and commit to forging a new global partnership founded on mutual responsibility and trust. That will require developing nations to take greater ownership of the post-2015 agenda. One of the failings of aid has been the lack of attention to country-specific context in agreements. So now is the time for the developing world to make its voice heard in order to shape the debate and ensure that policies and programmes are demand-driven. It will also require Governments to empower those whose lives we are trying to transform, to give them a However, we are greatly saddened to see Syria tear itself apart and Syrians killing each other. The international community must do its utmost to stop that tragedy.Allow me to turn to Cuba. The embargo against Cuba, which has been in place for decades, unjustly penalizes that country. We call for the lifting of the embargo in order to allow the country to resume the place it deserves in the comity of nations.At the national level, Chad, which has definitively turned the painful page of wars and divisions, is now fully devoted to its development by exploiting its mineral and energy resources through daring strategies. To do that, it has just adopted a national development plan that will soon be the subject of a round table on its funding and implementation. At the political level, we give pride of place to dialogue. We have established a permanent political dialogue framework that brings together the majority and the opposition and has the power, inter alia, to create structures for the organization of future elections. With the assistance of Chads partners, in particular the United Nations, we have taken all the necessary steps to prevent and put an end to the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict.In conclusion, allow me to reiterate a major concern for my country. It is our ardent wish to finally see the long-awaited reform in the United Nations, particularly the Security Council. That reform, which has become an issue of justice and equity, is a top priority for Africa. Keeping Africa, as well as other key actors on the international scene, outside that universal forum appears shocking today to hundreds of millions of human beings throughout the world. The awakening of the peoples of Africa, the role of the continent in the world and its indispensable contribution to preventing and settling conflict means that our continent can no longer be sidelined from the prestigious institution that is the Security Council."}}
