{"speech":{"0":" Today, I address the Assembly at a time when I feel great uncertainty about the future of the Organization and the established rules governing the relations among its Member States. It was expected that yesterday the Assembly would hear, from this rostrum, a statement from President Al-Bashir, the elected President of the Republic of the Sudan. However, with deep regret I must report the refusal by the authorities of the United States, the host Government, to give entry visas to President Al-Bashir and his delegation, thus rendering him unable to participate in the work of the Assembly at this session. The fact that the authorities of the host country did not grant a visa to our President is a serious violation of the principles and purposes set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. Specifically, it is a violation of the Headquarters Agreement signed in December 1946 with the host country. President Al-Bashir is known throughout Africa. He is known by all those who hold peace dear. He is known by everybody for what he has done — putting an end to the longest bloodthirsty civil war in Africa, inherited from the days of colonialism. The birth of the Republic of South Sudan is clear proof of his commitment to the implementation of the provisions of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Despite the tremendous sacrifice made by giving up a valuable part of the territory, one rich in natural and human resources, President Al-Bashir has been prevented from participating in the work of the General Assembly. However, the meeting of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union has highlighted the part that he has played in supporting peace between the Sudan and South Sudan and throughout our region.MINUSMA, so that it can complete the job of eradicating the terrorist groups. These are now in difficult straits, but are far from having, as it were, uttered their final word.It is also urgent to put in place regional and international coordination, the job of which would be to provide security for all of the Sahelo-Saharan area. Vigorous measures of a general nature need to be taken against drug trafficking and cross-border organized crime. In that regard, I wish to express my sympathy for the plight of the hostages held by terrorists in the Sahelo-Saharan area. I convey my condolences to their families and call for more efforts to achieve their prompt release.The problems of the Sahel are not just security problems. That part of the world is among the most aff licted. It is subject to the effects of climate change, desertification and recurring droughts, as well as the resulting food shortages and malnutrition. It needs significant investment as part of a sustained global strategy, supported by the entire international community, to ensure the economic progress that is vital for its stabilization and its deliverance from the clutches of violence.Terrorism in Africa affects not only the Sahel, but also the Horn of Africa. It struck the Kenyan people on 23 September in the form of the bloody and murderous attack on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi. I should like to take this opportunity to express my condolences to the Government of Kenya.The populations in the Central African Republic are, tragically, experiencing an unprecedented level of violence. The Niger calls for an international intervention, as in Mali in January 2013, to put an end to the martyrdom of the people of the Central African Republic.With respect to Palestine, it is heartbreaking to think that in todays world, so characterized by highly sophisticated technology and so imbued with modern values, a people could be deprived of its most elementary rights. The Niger is hopeful that the current initiative of the United States Government will be successful and will lead to the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian State beside and in harmonious coexistence with Israel.What is happening in Syria is a veritable tragedy, even in this topsy-turvy world. A millennial civilization is crumbling before our eyes. We condemn the use of will be dealt with in our policy. We are committed to the principles of human rights, and we have set up an independent national human rights commission in the Sudan, founded in accordance with the Paris principles, that cooperates with the relevant United Nations agencies.To promote and strengthen human rights, we signed a national law to combat trafficking in human beings. We have many specialized institutions and mechanisms that work to defend womens rights as well, so that women can participate fully in our society and in our State. That can be seen very clearly in the positive discrimination we have been pursuing vis-a-vis women, which has led to greater political participation by women at the legislative, executive and other decision-making levels.In 2010 we adopted a law on the rights of the child that is in accordance with the principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocols, so that we can promote the rights of children and protect them against any kind of violence or exploitation. Our various national institutions coordinate among themselves, and we have set up a national board for children. We have police who deal especially with the issues of youth and children, and we have a public prosecutor who specializes in this area.Once South Sudan was established, we immediately began to engage in neighbourly and fruitful cooperation with it. We have blood ties with it and a common border more than 2,100 kilometres long. About two thirds of the inhabitants of both countries live along the borders. The period following the independence of South Sudan was a period of some tension because of certain matters that had been left pending, so the two countries entered into very intensive negotiations. On 27 September 2012, exactly one year ago, in Addis Ababa the two countries were able to sign nine agreements covering all matters of cooperation between our two countries. We included mechanisms for implementing the agreements in an accompanying document. We also set forth deadlines for reaching further agreements. At the most recent negotiating session between the two Presidents, in Khartoum on 3 September, and in the presence of Mr. Mbeki, the two Presidents came to an agreement on how to deal with all pending matters. They also appealed to the international community to cancel the Sudans debt and to lift the sanctions imposed on it. My delegation would like to say that this unjustified and unacceptable action sets a very serious precedent in the history of the United Nations. It requires that the whole membership take a firm position on this matter. This denial of the legitimate right of a Member State leads us to call on the Secretary-General to exercise his duty and responsibility to protect the rights of Member States under the Headquarters Agreement. If the matter were left up to the Sudan, then the same kind of thing could happen to any other Member State, and we would not like those rights to be violated. I should like to warmly congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I take this opportunity to extend my countrys thanks to his predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremic, for the excellent manner in which he guided the work at the last session. We also thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his team in the Secretariat for the sincere and diligent work that they have done for us.It is our hope that discussions during this session will be successful. The theme chosen, “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”, is important. The Sudan believes that the Organization and its specialized agencies will indeed devote the importance that is appropriate to such a crucial issue because development is essential to international peace and security, particularly in developing countries. As everyone knows, poverty, underdevelopment, climate change and a shortage of resources are some of the main causes of conflict in the world.The Sudan has made great strategic progress regarding peace, stability and prosperity for its people and has begun a political process that will lead to the adoption of a final constitution. After the peace efforts proved successful vis-a-vis the independence of South Sudan, we accepted the choice of its people. Today we are working to develop a solid economic system, even though we have to deal with the after-effects of economic sanctions that the United States unilaterally imposed on us. We have begun to take economic steps necessary to strengthen our economy and prevent it from collapsing. On the matter of human rights, I should like to share the opinion expressed by the Special Rapporteur on the Sudan. He recognized that progress had been made in various areas of human rights. These matters have been dealt with very seriously, and the recommendations like to work with others through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.The situation is deteriorating every year. We have suffered from climate change since the mid-1980s. We have suffered from recurrent cycles of drought in much of our territory, and that has also been a factor in slowing down our development goals. It has also created instability in many parts of our country because of conflict over pasture land and water supplies. That applies also in Darfur, where historically there have been tribal disputes and disputes over pastureland because of long periods of drought. The Darfur conflict became a political issue only in the last decade because of external interference. There is a very close relationship between climate change and armed conflict in that respect.My country attaches paramount importance to the rule of law at the national and international levels. We make sure that our national laws and our legislature are in accordance with international instruments, laws and treaties to which we are a party. So from this rostrum, and based on our own experience, we reiterate our rejection of the International Criminal Court (ICC). Over the past decade or so it has been violating the principles of international law and justice. The ICC has been used as a political tool by certain parties in the international arena. Many of those that signed the Rome Statute have now become aware of the negative impact of the ICC and its destructive impact on stability and peace. The last African Union Summit showed that very clearly.Regarding the crisis in Syria, our position has always been clear. We call for peaceful dialogue among the Syrians themselves towards identifying a peaceful and permanent solution. We have always rejected violence and foreign interference. We condemn the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict, and we support the Russian approach to resolving this matter.The question of Palestine — how to achieve justice and restore the rights of the Palestinian people and stop the illegal aggression by the Israeli authorities in that territory — is still a real challenge in the international arena. The prisoners must be released. The matter must be resolved within the context of international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative, but Israel has simply turned a deaf ear to proposals from the Arab sides. Turning now to the matter of unilateral sanctions, it is our hope that we will have strong and healthy relations with South Sudan, and we will spare no effort to achieve that. We trust the international community will be supportive of our efforts. We would like to extend our thanks to the African high-level mechanism and the Prime Minister of Ethiopia in this connection. I am happy to be able to report that the efforts of the Government of the Sudan and the international community vis-a-vis Darfur have made possible real and continuous progress in terms of stability and security. There has been a sharp drop in the violence there because those that signed the Doha peace agreement have lived up to their promises. Many of the armed groups joined the agreement later. The voluntary return of people who had left is also being organized and services are being provided.I should like to say that relations between the Government of the Sudan and United Nations bodies with regard to the humanitarian situation are now stable, so that humanitarian needs can be met. We reached an agreement with UNICEF on vaccinations against poliomyelitis and other diseases, and an agreement was reached as part of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.Regarding non-governmental organizations, the Sudan, like other Member States, is committed to the implementation of the development goals, including combating poverty. We have adopted policies on reducing poverty and on providing more jobs for young graduates. We are also developing a microfinance system for low- and middle-income people. Unfortunately, however, unemployment is not as low as we had hoped, and the unilateral economic sanctions have been a real obstacle to our making progress in development and in strengthening our economy. It has been particularly difficult for young people in the Sudan, who account for about 60 per cent of our population. The Sudan calls on the international community to live up to its promise to cancel the debt and to lift unilateral economic sanctions. The matter of the debt is one of the important goals of the post-2015 development agenda. Debt is a real burden for so many countries in the world.The Sudan is a prominent member of many international bodies dealing with the environment. As a victim of climate change, the Sudan believes that great attention should be paid to environmental issues and goals in the post-2015 development agenda. We would are now witnessing regression. Some Asian States are facing similar risks of destabilization. The number of post-conflict countries is also on the rise, inevitably affecting global development in an interconnected world. Never before has the need been more compelling for equal partnership and the participation of all Member States, based on mutual respect and norms as embodied in the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. The United Nations, by the power invested in it by its Member States, stands out as our unquestioned leading entity on the world stage.Kazakhstan strongly condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria, as confirmed by the findings of an independent investigation by the United Nations mission, and regards it as a crime against humanity. We support the adoption of a Security Council resolution on Syria that would stipulate strict compliance with a concerted decision on the elimination of chemical weapons in that country and the conduct of regular inspections of that process.We express our hope that the accession of Syria to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, as well as the placement of such weapons under international control, will preclude the possibility of their repeated use and will contribute towards the end of the long-standing and bloody conflict in Syria. We call for the earliest possible convening of an international conference on the settlement of that conflict, with the aim of ending the violence and determining Syrias political future through dialogue and reconciliation.The current situation in the nuclear disarmament process also does not encourage confidence in a more peaceful future. While we participated actively in yesterdays High-level Meeting, we stress once again now from the rostrum of the General Assembly that our country has a special moral authority to champion the cause of nuclear abolition. By closing the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site soon after our independence in 1991 and renouncing the fourth-largest nuclear arsenal, Kazakhstan made a unique contribution in the multilateral effort to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons.We believe that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which remains the cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime, must reach full universalization, with the strict implementation of national obligations in accordance with the three There has been a constant call for respect for international law. The reform of the United Nations and its principal and subsidiary organs is a matter of some urgency and importance. It is time for a practical process to start, with a clear work programme, so that the international system can act in a manner that is fair, transparent and effective, so that it can take up the challenges it faces. But no progress will be made in reform until the General Assembly can play its full part and exercise all of its powers without any intimidation from the Security Council. The matter of reform of the Security Council is also of some importance for the Sudan, because that will mean that there is real reform in the United Nations. The Security Council today does not reflect the realities of the world. It adopts resolutions and takes decisions but not in a democratic and transparent way. It is therefore essential that there be comprehensive reform. Partial or transitional reforms are not possible. We support the African Union position on reform of the international system. We want a balanced, pluralistic and fairer system that will be able to deal with the challenges of the world of today, ensure respect for international law and for the noble principles of the Organization and attain the purposes and principles of the Charter — respect for the sovereignty of States and non-interference in domestic issues under any pretext whatsoever; the non-use of force; and the non-use of the threat of force against others."}}
