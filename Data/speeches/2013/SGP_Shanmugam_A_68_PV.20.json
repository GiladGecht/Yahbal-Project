{"speech":{"0":" I warmly congratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election as President at the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly and wish him success during his term.Over the past decade, the world has experienced a string of crises. Development has slowed. Confidence in the global economic system has been shaken. There are signs of recovery, but growth remains anaemic and uneven. Unemployment is high in many countries, particularly among the young. That has exacerbated problems by increasing poverty levels, widening income gaps, adding to social instability and causing public trust in Governments and institutions to decline. Extreme poverty remains a major concern in many parts of the world.Violence and conflict are as great a threat to global stability as poverty, and the international community must respond firmly to them. In that regard, Singapore welcomes the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 2118 (2013) on the destruction of chemical weapons in Syria. We strongly condemn the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances, as it constitutes a violation of international law. We remain deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in Syria, and we hope that the “Geneva II” conference will be convened promptly and will find a political solution to end the conflict and violence. We also offer condolences to the Government and the people of Kenya over the brutal attacks in Westgate Mall, a painful reminder of the need to remain vigilant against terror. All countries must unite against violence and terror in core purpose of the post-2015 development agenda is to improve the lives of people. Today, 1.2 billion people still live in extreme poverty. That is a staggering figure.Secondly, we should emphasize urban management and the intertwined issues of water and sanitation. According to the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, more than half of the worlds population lives in urban areas. By 2050, 7 out of 10 people will live in urban areas. Many cities are already under strain. More than 2.5 billion people lack access to basic sanitation, and another 800 million do not have safe drinking water. Some 2,000 children die every day from diarrhoea. The crisis will be exacerbated as more people move to crowded cities, where the infrastructure cannot grow fast enough to support them. Singapore introduced a draft resolution in July, which was adopted by the General Assembly (resolution ), to designate 19 November as World Toilet Day. We hope that will encourage countries to take a close look at how the nexus of urbanization, water and sanitation can be better managed.Thirdly, it is important for the views and concerns of small States to be incorporated into the post-2015 development agenda. Small States make up more than half of the United Nations membership; many, especially small island developing States (SIDS), are among the more vulnerable Members of the United Nations family. Singapore identifies closely with the urgent concerns of our fellow SIDS. The third SIDS Conference, to be held in 2014, will be an important milestone, and Singapore has participated actively in all the preparatory meetings to date. At last years inaugural Conference on Small Island Developing States, which was organized by the Forum of Small States (FOSS), Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon agreed that small and vulnerable States deserved special attention. Singapore will continue to work with the members of FOSS to share the perspectives of small States and ensure that our views are factored into the evolution of the new global development road map.Although we are a small country, we will continue to play our part in assisting other countries in poverty eradication and furthering the sustainable development agenda. We established the Singapore Cooperation Programme in 1992 to share our developmental experience with our friends — our successes and our failures alike. We believe that technical assistance and capacity-building are more effective in creating the right conditions for growth. More than 80,000 jobs and alleviate poverty, we also gradually moved our industries up the value chain towards higher-skilled, innovation-focused sectors. Given Singapores land and resource constraints, sustainable development was a necessity, not just a slogan. At 700 square kilometres, Singapore is slightly bigger than Manhattan but smaller than the five boroughs of New York. To ensure that our city-State remained liveable, we had to ensure that our policies on housing, infrastructure, transport and the environment were well integrated in a long-term and holistic vision.Over several decades, we have managed to pursue growth while preserving a good living environment. For instance, despite the countrys being densely populated and highly urbanized, our greening efforts have resulted in more than 50 per cent of Singapore being covered by vegetation. The Singapore Botanic Gardens, founded in the nineteenth century, is the only city botanic garden in the world to include a tract of original, primary rainforest. And despite our rapid development, we have managed to preserve much of our biodiversity. One of our nature reserves, Bukit Timah, contains more plant species than the entire North American continent.We have also developed creative solutions to overcome some of our resource constraints. Take the example of water: Singapore now imports slightly more than 40 per cent of our water needs. To meet our drinking and industrial needs, we use a variety of methods, including collecting water through reservoirs, the desalination of seawater, and cutting-edge membrane technology to reclaim waste water into high-grade, ultra-clean water, which we call “NEWater”. When Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Singapore in March 2012, he was impressed enough by our water management to make a toast with NEWater, rather than wine, calling NEWater, “something far more valuable — the elixir of life”.Let me now turn to the post-2015 development agenda and suggest three priority areas. First, we should learn from the example of the Millennium Development Goals. We should avoid being prescriptive. As each country is unique, countries should be allowed to exercise f lexibility as to which goals they choose to prioritize and how they will achieve them. The new global development road map should have poverty eradication and sustainable development at its centre and should converge around a single, clear set of practical and quantifiable goals. We should keep to that outcomes-based approach and not forget that the vision of the Balkans working together, as the Prime Minister said, in spite of our history of so much war and conflict.Unfortunately, in his statement today we also heard references praising a unilateral action that constitutes an infringement of the basic principles of the Organization and a clear violation of the United Nations Charter and the resolutions of the Security Council, as well as being contrary to the core principles and norms of international law. Such an approach is counterproductive and runs contrary to all the efforts that have been invested so far in achieving a sustainable solution to the situation in our southern province of Kosovo and Metohija, particularly those made following the signing of the First Agreement on Principles Governing the Normalization of Relations only six months ago.Let me point out that the Agreement, brokered through the significant facilitation efforts of Baroness Ashton, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, provides a framework for reaching practical and sustainable solutions to the issues burdening the daily life of the people in the province and in no way implies a recognition by Serbia of a unilateral pact. As stated by the President of Serbia, His Excellency Mr. Tomislav Nikolic, Belgrade and Pristina have reached agreement only over clearly defined matters such as municipal elections and the establishment of the community of Serbian municipalities in Kosovo and Metohija. The Republic of Serbia has not and will not recognize either de jure or de facto the independence of Kosovo.The call for recognition as heard today, at a time when we are in the midst of investing efforts through courage and wisdom, in the words of the Prime Minister of Albania, is contrary to the ongoing process. Furthermore, it will not contribute favourably to the strengthening of confidence and the improvement of relations between the States of the Balkans.Finally, let me reiterate that the issue of resolving the status of our southern province is one of my Governments foremost priorities. Time and again, we have demonstrated our readiness and willingness to make an active contribution to overcoming the accumulated problems in the aforementioned political dialogue in Brussels. My country has shown great f lexibility in trying to bring about a solution acceptable to all and one that takes into account the legitimate interests of all communities in Kosovo and Metohija.Government officials from 170 countries have received training under the Programme in areas as diverse as sustainable urban development, water management and human-resource development. To support our engagement in the post-2015 development agenda, we will develop and customize new programmes on sustainable development and climate change that meet the needs of SIDS and least developed countries.Singapore has also been working with other Governments to promote sustainable development internationally. In 2007, Singapore and China embarked on a joint project to develop the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city, which is envisioned as a city that will be socially harmonious, environmentally friendly and resource-efficient. That will become a model for sustainable urbanization in China. By 2020, the Eco-city is intended to be a low-carbon, green-living environment approximately half the size of Manhattan, housing around 350,000 people. Singapore will continue to share its experience in sustainable urbanization through Singapore-led events such as the biennial Singapore International Water Week and the World Cities Summit.The only way to secure our collective future is through poverty eradication and sustainable development. The next two years will be critical for the world as we embark on an ambitious journey to map out the post-2015 agenda. The United Nations must play a leading role, and we are fully committed to working closely with other Member States to achieve that."}}
