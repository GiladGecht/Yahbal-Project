{"speech":{"0":" I bring you sincere greetings and very best wishes from His Excellency Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the Republic of Sierra Leone. President Koroma regrets that he is unable to participate in the general debate of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session due to unavoidable circumstances. He has, however, instructed me, as his Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, to deliver to the Assembly this message of goodwill:“I congratulate Ambassador Ashe most warmly on his election to direct the affairs of the Assembly during this session and assure him of my countrys support and cooperation during his heart of any serious effort to stabilize the region. While welcoming the efforts of the United States, which led to a resumption of negotiations, Algeria expresses the hope that the international community can redouble its efforts for the rapid establishment of an internationally recognized Palestinian State within the borders of June 1967, with Al-Quds as its capital.The legitimacy of the United Nations must be strengthened and its role enhanced, and to that end its reform must not be unduly delayed. We must ensure that the General Assembly remains participatory in nature and must increase the economic, social, humanitarian and environmental functions of the programmes, entities and agencies of the United Nations system. We must also agree on a democratic reform of the Security Council that covers its working methods and its composition and ensures equitable representation, taking into particular account the African States Ezulwini Consensus. The United Nations must be heeded when, from within the democratic framework of the General Assembly, it issues statements of strong positions that reflect the universal conscience, whether it is a question of strengthening the foundations of international humanitarian law and protecting civilians or specific situations, such as the long overdue lifting of the economic blockade that has been imposed on Cuba for decades now and the current one imposed on the Gaza Strip. The will of the international community that is so often reiterated here must prevail.Algeria is working within the organizations and groups to which it belongs and with its other partners towards the elimination of the many obstacles to building peaceful, well-balanced and just international relations. We are nurturing the virtues of dialogue, and we place our hopes in the Alliance of Civilization and mutual respect among religions. Algeria is deeply dedicated to the heritage of the values shared by all humankind, beginning with the sacred nature, value and dignity of human beings and the promotion and protection of all human rights. It is this commitment that inspires Algerias candidature for a seat on the Human Rights Council for the 2014-2016 period. This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, and Algeria, moved by a high sense of responsibility, would like to dedicate itself to improving the effectiveness of the Council, strengthening the universal and interdependent nature of human rights slum populations, to name a few. However, this has not been uniform, as inequalities among many populations are on the rise, particularly in southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where food insecurity and malnutrition are still prevalent. While access to health and education may be expanding for us, the quality of those services in many regions remains a serious challenge.“That is why the theme of this session, ‘The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage, is timely and appropriate. We are moving into the phase of mapping out another development framework that is expected to formulate universal goals and responsibilities encompassing the economic, social and environmental spheres. The post-2015 development agenda should have at its core the urgent need to address the causes and consequences of conflict, violence and disasters. These are universal issues of great concern to the global community. Resolving and preventing conflict and violence, creating jobs, providing further incentives for foreign direct investment, broadening human and financial resources, ensuring gender equality and promoting human rights and the rule of law are not only fundamental to human progress; they are integral to sustainable development.“Sierra Leone welcomes the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty earlier this year. This is a significant and historic achievement in our collective efforts in pursuit of a safer and more secure world. We therefore hope that the illegal transfer of conventional weapons to the wrong hands — a major source of the escalation of conflicts in the developing world, particularly in Africa — can now be largely regulated and minimized. “In that regard, we remain committed to supporting international instruments aimed at establishing peace and security in the world and an economic order that is beneficial to the rich and the poor, the weak and the strong, as well as to nations big and small.“In recent years, and despite being under post-conflict rebuilding, Sierra Leones contribution to the United Nations peacekeeping efforts demonstrates our strong commitment to the purpose and principles of global peace and stability. We stand ready to increase our profile in the tenure. Let me avail myself of this opportunity to also express the appreciation of my delegation to his predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremic of Serbia, for his able leadership in directing the work of the General Assembly during the past session. I wish him well in his future endeavours. Let me also express sincere appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his constructive and fruitful leadership of the Organization. Sierra Leone will continue to support the progressive implementation of his five-year Global Action Agenda.“Over the past two decades, global peace, security and the economic environment have evidently been radically transformed, to the point where neither the problems nor their solutions are simple. The international security situation has become more complex. Regional hotspot issues keep f laring up, and turbulence continues in many parts of the world, in particular Asia and Africa. Human trafficking, in addition to other non-traditional security issues such as climate change, nuclear safety, energy, food and maritime security and financing for development are becoming more significant.“The use of chemical weapons in conflict poses a renewed global security threat. There is therefore a need for increased multilateral and collective engagement and responses to those complex challenges.“As we all are aware, the target date for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is only two years away. While we take stock of what have been achieved and the challenges that continue to confront us, we should, in keeping with the principles set out in the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development outcome document, entitled ‘The future we want (resolution , annex), embark upon designing a post-2015 development goals agenda in which the specific needs and challenges of every Member States are recognized. There is no doubt that failure to capture those specific needs and commitments would compromise the credibility of such an agenda.“We also note that important progress has been made in many areas, such as reducing poverty globally, improving access to primary education for all children, reducing child and maternal mortality, increasing access to HIV treatment and reducing to raise the country to middle-income status, we have rolled those residual challenges over to our successor development programme, the ‘Agenda for Prosperity, which I launched in July this year. This is Sierra Leones road map to our post-2015 development agenda. It aims to build a sustainable future for all Sierra Leoneans, requiring sound macroeconomic management and fiscal policies for a society with strong institutions to facilitate good governance, the social, economic and political empowerment of women and young people, the required social support for the disadvantaged, increased transparency and accountability, and justice for all.“In taking up this huge challenge, Sierra Leone will continue to welcome the strong partnership that exists with the various United Nations agencies and other international development partners for the achievement of a well-planned, seamless transition to a more developmental phase of peacebuilding and for scaling up support to Sierra Leones political and economic priorities, as outlined in our ‘Agenda for Prosperity. Sierra Leone, a nation with good credentials as a post-conflict country, is a deserving candidate for continued international support.“Sierra Leone continues to uphold its national heritage of interreligious tolerance and peaceful coexistence, as well as the principle of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. In that regard, we remain focused on, and committed to, our reporting obligations to international treaty bodies. “In line with the relevant provisions of the Disability Act 2011, we have established a National Commission for Persons with Disability. The current and first Chairman and Chief Commissioner is a person with impaired vision. We have also enacted the Sexual Offences Act 2012 to address the specific issue of sexual violence against women and girls. Sierra Leone will continue to collaborate with the United Nations and other interested partners in promoting the enactment of the Gender Equality Bill so as to enhance womens participation in the decision-making process.“We commend the support of the United Nations and international partners for the work of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, whereby it has made meaningful contributions to the peacekeeping landscape so as to ensure the success of peacekeeping operations. To that end, we will continue to actively engage in all new initiatives for reform of the United Nations peacekeeping operations.“We applaud and acknowledge the human resources and financial support that the United Nations family and other development partners continue to provide, especially towards the successful conduct of our 17 November 2012 presidential, parliamentary and local government elections, all of which were held in one day, for the very first time. Those elections were widely considered to be a critical benchmark for us, signalling our preparedness to move into a more developmental phase of peacebuilding. It should come as little or no surprise that they were widely acclaimed to be peaceful, free, fair and transparent by the international community. Their successful conduct clearly demonstrates the level that Sierra Leones democratic process has attained, an experience we are willing to share with other countries in our subregion and beyond.“Today, Sierra Leone is on the threshold of transformation in its engagement with the Peacebuilding Commission as well as in its socioeconomic development. With support from the Commission and the Peacebuilding Support Office as well as other international and local development partners, Sierra Leone continues to make significant gains in the areas of good governance, human rights, gender equality and the fight against corruption and transnational organized crime. A number of international treaties have been ratified and national legislations enacted to address these challenges, which have the potential to undermine ongoing peacebuilding and peace-consolidation efforts.“Sierra Leones vision for transformative and inclusive socioeconomic development was initially encapsulated in my Governments poverty-reduction strategy, articulated in the ‘Agenda for Change that we rolled out in my first term of office. These have been encouraging achievements and with residual challenges as well. In my current, second term, we are poised to build on those successes with renewed determination. “With a sustained commitment to provide improved standards of living for our people and critical one for the United Nations as it marks the Organizations seventieth anniversary. It is also the target date for the MDGs and the tenth year since the World Summit was held in 2005. “We are expected to agree on a post-2015 development framework. It is imperative that we follow a pragmatic approach with renewed vigour and commitment to providing our people with a future that guarantees justice, peace and security, accountable and democratic governance, a transparent and equitable distribution of wealth, a safe and sustainable environment and health and education for all. Those are all essential elements in setting the stage for the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda.“Let me join the family of the United Nations in expressing our condolences and solidarity with the people of Kenya, Pakistan and Nigeria for the irreparable loss of valuable lives during the recent terrorist attacks. Our thoughts and prayers are strongly and firmly with the families of the deceased.”"}}
