{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of the Government of San Marino, I wish to congratulate His Excellency Mr. John Ashe on his election as President of the of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. His long experience as Ambassador of Antigua and Barbuda and his in-depth knowledge of the Organization are precious resources for the United Nations. The Republic of San Marino supports the essential elements of his programme, mentioned in his inaugural address (see ), and ensures its full cooperation in all work of the General Assembly. My country also wishes to express special thanks to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his energy, commitment and extraordinary determination to the benefit of the United Nations. We appreciate the sensitivity demonstrated by the Secretary-General towards all Member States, without distinction, and his constant presence in all international politically relevant and emergency situations. His visit this year to our Republic on the occasion of the Investiture Ceremony of Their Excellencies the Captains Regent marked a significant moment in the history and public life of our small State, and was an honour for the San Marino people.The theme chosen this years session — “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” — places at the heart of our debate the need to pursue the Millennium Development Goals and to comply with the obligations undertaken. It also serves to reaffirm that it is only through the determined commitment of the Organization that those Goals can be effectively achieved.We believe that significant progress has been made in achieving many of the Goals, such as the eradication of extreme poverty, access to drinkable water, combatting HIAIDS, malaria and other diseases, and the improvement of the health conditions of women and children. However, we are well aware that the full achievement of those objectives is still far off. Despite My countrys priorities include environmental sustainability and the prevention of and response to natural disasters. Over the last years, certain regions of the world have been shaken by unprecedented natural disasters. In Asia, Latin America and Africa, in particular in the Horn of Africa, local communities have suffered from extreme conditions, experiencing the tragic consequences of their vulnerability and of food and health uncertainty.Our thanks go to the Secretary-General, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Central Emergency Response Fund for their prompt and crucial intervention in favour of populations affected by natural disasters. However, individual Member States must do more and give rapid and effective support to populations in emergency situations, both by investing in the most vulnerable regions so as to build the capacities necessary for preventive action and by providing them with the moral and financial support necessary to cope with disasters.The Republic of San Marino attaches great importance to the issue of preventing and responding to natural disasters. Despite its small size, it ranks fifty-first on the list of donors to the Central Emergency Response Fund.Lastly, the finalization of the post-2015 development agenda cannot be separated from a discussion on the strengthening of global governance mechanisms, since the achievement of the new development goals will be the result of cooperation among all Member States. San Marino believes that the United Nations has the duty to retain its leadership role in global governance management.My country is a traditional sponsor of the annual draft resolution entitled “The United Nations in global governance”, to be submitted in 2013 for the third time. It reiterates the need for a more inclusive, transparent and effective approach to solving the worlds problems and recognizes the central role to be played by the United Nations in global governance.Indeed, the highly democratic nature and the universal character of the United Nations grant it indisputable legitimacy and a patrimony deriving from the cultural diversities and the traditions it represents. This leads to an approach focusing on humankind and the promotion of human rights in which the needs of the entire international community are taken into account. Indeed, global problems require global solutions.still the victims of discrimination and violence in many parts of the world, including in the most developed countries. In the poorest regions of our planet, maternal mortality remains a challenge. Moreover, women are the most vulnerable to HIV infection. Trafficking in women is far from being resolved. Women are often subject to abuse and to humiliating and degrading treatment, including polygamy, child marriage, kidnapping and sexual violence, including domestic violence. Women living in conflict and post-conflict situations are often subject to sexual violence, mass rape, torture, summary executions.The advancement of womens rights and the elimination of all barriers to their full participation in political, economic and social life must be top priorities for the United Nations, along with the promotion of their economic opportunities and equality in all sectors.The United Nations has the duty to protect children, the most vulnerable victims of violence, abuse and exploitation. In the most poverty-stricken areas of the world, the infant mortality rate is still unacceptable and a very high number of children suffer from chronic malnutrition, which is the main cause of child mortality. My country hopes for the universal ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocols and their full implementation.The international community must strive for the full inclusion and participation of people with disabilities in the economic, social and cultural life of the community. Despite the significant steps forward taken over the last years in terms of equality and non-discrimination against disabled persons, much remains to be done for the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, through the adoption of legislative measures and national and international policies. The Republic of San Marino welcomes the convening of the High-level Meeting on the Realization of the Millennium Development Goals and Other Internationally Agreed Development Goals for Persons with Disabilities (see ) and fully supports its outcome document (resolution ).In particular, it must be stressed that the protection of disabled persons can be more easily achieved if the social and economic policies of individual States and international organizations pay due attention to the institution of the family as the natural environment in which human beings are born and develop their awareness of the rights and duties regulating coexistence among people. tireless efforts to build a safer and more prosperous world.The numerous challenges that the United Nations is currently facing are far more complex than previous ones. Those challenges are such that all of us have to ensure, through joint efforts, coordinated and efficient action to overcome them. That is our moral, collective obligation towards the well-being of future generations.The challenge of achieving sustainable development and integrating its three dimensions is the greatest of them all. It is encouraging that the General Assembly, bound by the Rio outcome document (resolution , annex), is successfully addressing this priority. With the establishment of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals, the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing and the High-level Political Forum, the institutional framework as a platform for substantive work has been strengthened.In that context, the role of the United Nations and the results of efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 are becoming more important than ever. I am certain that the United Nations, guided by the synergy and pragmatic approach of its Members and all stakeholders, will be able to respond to that highly complex challenge. Such an approach will contribute to our well-being and a safer future for all of us, further strengthening the central role of the United Nations in the system of global governance. To that end, poverty eradication and the other unmet MDGs must remain at the heart of the post-2015 development agenda. We must define future sustainable development goals on the basis of the experience and lessons learned from our success or failure in accomplishing the tasks set by the Millennium Declaration (resolution ). Montenegro is working diligently on the MDGs and is close to meeting them.Our sustainable development goals must be clear, universal, f lexible and coherent, and represent a central part of the post-2015 global development agenda. They must clearly reflect political commitment to sustainable development and promote economic development, social inclusion, the sustainable use of natural resources and protection of the environment as well peace and security. As a member of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals, Montenegro is working assiduously to define those goals, taking into Against that background, our Organization must adapt. The political role and authority of the General Assembly, and reform of the Security Council, are the core issues of such a reform process. The demands made today by the peoples of North Africa and the Middle East require a review of working methods and the decision-making process in order to ensure that solutions are reached in the context of which the interests and positions of all parties concerned are duly taken into account.The Republic of San Marino has always believed in the power of dialogue, democracy and respect for others. That is why, in its centuries-old history, it has never fought any war. Drawing on that experience, we believe that — and this is our contribution to the general debate — the Millennium Development Goals and the definition of the post-2015 development agenda need to be set within this perspective.Address by Mr. Milo Dukanovic, Prime Minister of Montenegro"}}
