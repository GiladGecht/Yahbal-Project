{"speech":{"0":" It is a great honour for me to address the Assembly for the first time as Vice-President of the Republic of South Sudan.First, I would like to express the heartfelt condolences of the Government and the people of South Sudan to the people and the Government of the Republic of Kenya, in particular the families of those affected by the brutal and inhuman act of terror in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. We condemn all acts of terrorism and pledge our full cooperation and support to all efforts In Egypt and Syria, which has been ravaged by war, we hope that dialogue and diplomacy prevail over force, so that we can avoid sacrificing more human lives. In the Middle East, we continue to defend the Palestinian cause with as much conviction as ever. It is crucial for the Palestinian people in particular, and for political stability and peacebuilding in the Arab world in general, that negotiations between the Palestinian authorities and the State of Israel advance towards the creation of a sovereign Palestinian State, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.As to Europe, we offer a special word of recognition to France, which has never abandoned us and continues very actively to seek better ways of helping Guinea-Bissau overcome a political crisis. We also thank the Kingdom of Spain, whose Ambassador to the United Nations has been instrumental in efforts towards political normalization. Our friend Timor-Leste, a small country within the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP), has exhibited an admirable spirit of cooperation with Guinea-Bissau, demonstrating that friends do come through in the most difficult of times. The Timorese authorities have understood the very simple fact that supporting an institutional process of political normalization is not the same as supporting a coup detat. It is, indeed, quite the contrary. We very much thank President Armando Guebuza, current President of the CPLP, for his fair assessment of the political process in Guinea-Bissau, for his encouragement and for appealing to the international community to provide financial support for general elections in Guinea-Bissau. We also take this opportunity to congratulate Murade Murargy, a Mozambican national who currently serves as the Executive Secretary of CPLP, for his dedication to the political normalization process in our country. We hope one day, and perhaps one day soon, to see a full normalization of our relations with the countries of the CPLP, which is in the interests of all our peoples and sovereign States. With respect to Cuba, we call, as we have always done, for an end to the decades-long embargo and for the advancement of the reforms under way in that friendly nation, with which we have so many and such deep ties of friendship and solidarity.With respect to Asia, we wish to express our profound gratitude to the Peoples Republic of China for the extent and intensity of its cooperation with our picture of how well the country is run in our nine other states besides Jonglei.We are presently running a Government with acceptable standards of competence. A decentralized system of governance is the outcome of a conscious decision taken by South Sudans political leadership, as enshrined in the 2011 transitional Constitution, to build a broad-based democracy in the post-conflict setting. We set up the 10 states with popularly elected governors and democratic legislatures as a nucleus of good governance. In 2010, President Kiir Mayardit was democratically and overwhelmingly elected. Our noble struggle was to actualize the ideals and values of true democracy, so cherished by our people.According to our Constitution, the next elections will be held in 2015. Indeed, on 18 September, our President publicly confirmed the date. The governing party, the Sudan Peoples Liberation Movement (SPLM) will hold another general convention in March 2014 to freely elect its structures in preparation for the 2015 national general elections.Let me turn to the issue of women. Women have suffered discrimination since 1956, with a literacy rate hardly reaching 18 per cent. The SPLM as a ruling party is now raising womens political participation from the 25 per cent in the current Constitution to a minimum of 35 per cent in the proposed permanent constitution.In recent years, the National Legislative Assembly, of which I was twice elected Speaker and where I served a total of eight years, enacted a good number of laws, including the Petroleum Revenue Management Act and the Investment Act, among many others, setting out clear rules on how we can efficiently and prudently spend our oil revenues. With the support of our development partners in the region and internationally, we have now embarked on the development of our infrastructure. Numerous infrastructural projects are under way. In response to the oil shutdown last year, the Government implemented austerity measures. We reduced Government spending by 40 per cent, and at the moment we have considerably increased non-oil revenue collection. We take seriously our responsibility to ensure that public funds are properly utilized and that our spending is rigorously monitored. We are thus determined to uncompromisingly fight practices of maladministration, including corruption.We deeply regret the loss of the lives of the Indian peacekeepers, the Russian helicopter crew and the geared towards ridding the region and indeed the globe of terrorism.I convey sincere my gratitude, as well as that of President Kiir Mayardit and the people of South Sudan, to the United Nations, in particular the Security Council, the countries of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the Troika, and all people of goodwill for diplomatically helping us to bring to an end to the conflict that had devastated our country for decades. We are grateful in particular to the international community for closely monitoring the difficult implementation of the peace accord. Given the complexity of the issues involved, the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) has been relatively successful, although the protocols of the two states of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, the case of the contested area of Abyei, and the demarcation of the borders between South Sudan and the Sudan continue to impede the full implementation of the peace accord.Our country is well endowed with abundant natural resources. Our relations with the Sudan have recently involved unexpected tensions, with intermittent suspensions of oil f low through the Sudan. Inside the South itself, old quarrels dating back to time immemorial have re-emerged among certain communities over cattle-grazing and water points. This became complicated during the last war as guns of various calibre fell into the hands of unauthorized civilians. We are working hard as a Government to entrench peace in all corners of South Sudan. We have established programmes to rehabilitate and integrate former rebel groups into our armed forces and society at large.We have to build a country literally from scratch, with non-existent physical and social infrastructure. This has given us the worst human development indicators in the world, including high maternal and infant mortality rates and high illiteracy rates among a population of over 8 million.While we recognize that, as humans and as a Government, we must have made errors of judgment as we sought to fix a war-devastated country, successful steps have also been taken, and we appeal for the goodwill shown to us in those times of difficulty to continue. We are confronted with the test of adherence to human rights as a consequence of malicious action by external hands, rather than of our own making. We commend any objective criticism and we call on the experts on South Sudan also to appreciate the bigger receiving much-needed humanitarian assistance from United Nations agencies and other organizations. Out of the total population of approximately 140,000 in Pibor, for instance, nearly 100,000 people have been identified in the Pibor bush alone, along with another 10,000 in Juba City and 26,000 registered as refugees in neighbouring countries. We appeal from this rostrum for expeditious relief assistance in various forms.Another urgent security demand is the training of a police force capable of eliminating the high rate of crime we are experiencing in Pibor county and, indeed, the entire country. UNMISS, to which we express our profound appreciation, has helped transform hundreds of former combatants into a police force conscious of the rule of law. UNMISS is doing a very commendable job under its able leadership. The rate of crime caused by the proliferation of small arms has been alarming. While our police force has managed to apprehend many criminals, others are still at large. The Government is committed to erasing this menace. We refute any allegation to the effect that such violations are deliberate and systematic orchestrations.Our relationship with the Sudan has been a mixture of cooperation and squabbles. Fundamentally, both sides acknowledge that there is no alternative to lasting peace other than harmony and cooperation, given our shared history. That is why President Kiir Mayardit, remarkably, visited Khartoum early this month and held amicable discussions with his counterpart, President Omer Hassan Al-Bashir of the Sudan. They agreed to enhance cooperation on all fronts, including allowing the unhindered f low of oil from South Sudan through the Sudan.We call on the parties at war in the Sudan to find a durable political solution to the conflict, a situation to which the CPA has provided a workable remedy. We urge the international community to play a positive, stepped-up role in narrowing the gap between both parties. The civil war currently taking place in the Nuba mountains and Blue Nile regions of the Sudan, as well as in Darfur, has created an influx of refugees to South Sudan, and that is a source of concern for us. We appeal for humanitarian access and supplies for those refugees. Given our unique knowledge, acquaintance and position as partners to Khartoum and former comrades-in-arms in the fighting forces in those two regions, in addition to our interest in realizing peace along our northern Kenyan and South Sudanese relief workers in Pibor county. We express our condolences to the families and the Governments of those who lost their lives. We wish to assure the international community that such tragic incidents will not be repeated.Jonglei state, the most populous, with inaccessible terrain, has been of particular concern to us as a Government as well as to the international community. There is no doubt about that. It has serious security and infrastructural impediments. We regret the security impediments in Jonglei and assure the international community of our Governments determination to transform our army, the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army (SPLA), into a professional national army that respects human rights and the rule of law and is committed to the protection of civilians. The President has declared a general amnesty for the rebel groups, and already two large groups, one under General Bapin and the second under General Johnson Oluny, have responded positively. The President has also ordered the mandatory disarmament of the civilian population and has taken legal steps to punish the perpetrators of human rights violations in Jonglei, including an SPLA Brigade Commander, who is now under arrest together with 13 soldiers who have been sentenced to prison terms that range from three to five years. To date 84 cases of human rights abuses have been tried in the courts of law. We are determined to see that the violations committed by some indisciplined SPLA elements do not go unpunished. Recently the Government formed a peace and reconciliation committee headed by top religious leaders to promote dialogue with all groups, including rebel groups in Pibor county.The Government has allowed the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and other humanitarian bodies unhindered access to all parts of the country, including, of course, Jonglei state. Regarding the situation in Pibor county, which has been of particular concern to all of us, we have determined, thanks to UNMISS and OCHA, the number of people who are currently registered for food distribution in various camps for internally displaced persons and villages. If that number is compared with the pre-conflict population of Pibor county, we could now be relatively relieved at the fact that most of those who had been unaccounted for are in fact alive and end to human rights violations. It is important for the United Nations to monitor and promote the complete implementation of the cooperation agreements reached between South Sudan and Sudan to cement harmonious and peaceful coexistence."}}
