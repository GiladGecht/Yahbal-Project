{"speech":{"0":" Allow me at the outset, on behalf of the President of the Republic of Suriname, His Excellency Mr. Desire Delano Bouterse, and the people and the Government of Suriname, to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your well-deserved election. With your election you bring honour to your country, Antigua and Barbuda, and to the Caribbean. With your background in sustainable development, you are well prepared to lead us in our deliberations on this years theme, “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. I assure you of the support and cooperation of Suriname during your presidency.I should also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremic, for his leadership during the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Furthermore, I commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his management of the United Nations with regard to peace and security in various parts of the globe.Setting a new stage urgently requires much effort at the national as well as the international level to achieve the ultimate goal of improving the standard of living of our peoples and bringing about the sustainable development of our countries. The Millennium World Health Organization, UNESCO, UNICEF and others.The Government also attaches great importance to issues involving young people. In this regard, a large-scale after-school programme with the aim of enhancing better learning for youth deserves mention. The successful experiences in regional cooperation mechanisms, such as the one in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), as well as the one that is being considered in the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), are clear examples of how youth can contribute to the connectivity between peoples and the enhancement of unity.Taking into account global processes and cognizant of the opportunities and challenges from CARICOM and UNASUR, the post-2015 development agenda should emanate from an inclusive, intergovernmental process. That process should be directed towards: the continued eradication of poverty; a people-centred approach, combining economic activity with the social need for education and health care, thereby promoting the welfare and well-being of all; and the integration of economic and social action and strengthening of human capital.Global warming has a direct negative impact on the development of small island developing States and low-lying coastal States, including Suriname. Suriname shares its grave concern regarding the state of the global climate and the stalled United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change process. The Government of Suriname strongly recommends that the General Assembly face these challenges by making them part of the post-2015 development agenda.In setting the stage for development goals beyond 2015, we cannot ignore the various threats to international peace. International peace, security and human rights are indispensable in creating an enabling environment for sustainable development. Suriname is well aware of the fact that national sovereignty and national security are seriously affected by the indiscriminate use of violence in fighting terrorism and other forms of transnational organized crime. Challenges related to armed conflicts, poverty, food, the environment, education, public health, migration and energy require increased collaboration. In this respect, partnership among Governments, international and regional organizations and civil society is a must. We applaud the South American and Caribbean nations in the North. We must give substance to South-South cooperation. That is an important consideration for setting a new stage for global sustainable development. In this context, foreign direct investment is considered to be a factor of vital importance.It is encouraging to note that a number of countries, including my own, Suriname, have been upgraded from low-income status to middle-income status by international financial institutions and United Nations agencies. Our efforts to develop prudent macroeconomic and appropriate fiscal policies, combined with our initiatives to diversify our economy, and the sacrifices borne by our people, have led to this improved status. Applying per capita income as the major indicator for determining our development status has, however, manoeuvred us into a position where we have lost access to the necessary concessional loans and grants. The conclusion can be drawn that our people are being punished for their ability to overcome some of the obstacles that have made them less fortunate in the past.Within this interdependent world, we will continue to build on our own strength as the main driving force for the achievement of our development agenda. Furthermore, we believe that building upon national strengths, within the context of participation in subregional and regional cooperation frameworks, is the right way forward to finding proper solutions for development. On the basis of what has been achieved at the regional level, a global approach might become more feasible.Suriname shares the view that we should base the post-2015 development agenda on a people-centred approach, with a specific focus on the most vulnerable in society, in particular, women, youth, the elderly and people with disabilities. In so doing — and this we emphasize — we should strike the right balance between our positive macroeconomic situation and a micro situation that is in dire need of improvement.We are in the course of developing policies and programmes to fight non-communicable diseases that have led to decreased productivity. Non-communicable diseases have now become the leading cause of death in Suriname and in other countries in our region. There is special emphasis on improving education and bringing it closer to our socioeconomic reality. We intend to work more closely with relevant international organizations such as the Pan American Health Organization, the Allow me to begin by expressing our solidarity with the people of Kenya, while condemning in the strongest terms the cowardly acts of terrorism that were seen last week.I thank you, Sir, for selecting as the theme for this session “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”, which, in my delegations view, embodies the fundamental concerns of all countries, but will find particular resonance with small island developing States (SIDS) like Grenada. This is an area where the multilateral system must demonstrate its effectiveness not only to improve the lives of ordinary citizens but also to maintain confidence in our multilateral institutions. We look forward to key performance indicators linked to tangible outcomes, rather than more analysis and more reports.Grenada endorses the call made at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development for the future we want. In that context, we must build on the successes of the Millennium Development Goals and Agenda 21. Indeed, for a post-2015 development agenda we welcome a framework that goes beyond gross domestic product and recognizes the assets of natural capital. Grenada encourages the international financial institutions to go even further by also recognizing the liabilities associated with natural disasters caused by climate change. Those liabilities underscore the need to reassess the basis on which small island developing States are graduated to middle-income status, thereby losing access to concessionary funding that is sorely needed.The unilateral graduation of many small island developing States to middle-income status is premature. I therefore reiterate the call made in Agenda 21 for a more holistic and comprehensive set of indicators for classifying States. Grenada endorses support for low-income and fragile economies. Moreover, it is clear that several of the SIDS newly promoted to middle-income status continue to struggle with high debt burdens, which are worsened by climate change and high fossil-fuel import bills. Many SIDS also struggle with low productivity and low levels of competitiveness and with severe financial constraints, and, in some cases, they struggle with limited prospects for immediate growth.The point is that per capita income used as a sole measure without the context of climate vulnerability does more harm than good. To illustrate that point, as damaging as Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina were to the for their efforts towards regional peace and stability. Their willingness and capacity for further dialogue and persuasion is a better way to achieve and maintain peace than the use of violence and military intervention.We are proud to belong to a region that has declared itself a nuclear-weapon-free zone.We express the hope that the two-State solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict will gain more substance, allowing the peoples of both countries the prospect of peace and prosperity. Suriname maintains the position that the multilateral process within the United Nations should prevail in the search for a peaceful solution for the crisis in Syria.The Cuban people have the right to participate as full members in all regional organizations, and we strongly urge that all obstacles that have prevented their full participation so far be removed, including the outdated and inhuman unilateral economic, financial and commercial embargo.With regard to the Republic of Haiti, the international community tends to lose attention for the necessary follow-up activities to get Haiti back on its feet. Once again we call upon the international community to fulfil its commitments.In closing, I take advantage of this opportunity to inform the Assembly that, exactly 30 days ago, my country, Suriname, took over the pro tempore presidency of the Union of South American Nations, a young and vibrant regional body. We pledge that Suriname will, during its presidency, further the goals of UNASUR and contribute to international peace, security and sustainable development."}}
