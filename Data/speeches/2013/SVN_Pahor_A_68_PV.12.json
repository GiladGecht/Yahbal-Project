{"speech":{"0":" I would like to congratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election and wish him every success. Let me also pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and thank him for his tireless efforts and leadership in promoting the ideals and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The ideal and principle to which we should aspire is creating a world in which everyone can live free from fear, free from want and in dignity. The United Nations has achieved many extraordinary successes in the past, but we also have to acknowledge some disappointing and frustrating setbacks and failures. I believe that now more than ever, the United Nations must play a major role in international relations. We live at a time when the balance of global power is changing in a rapid and dramatic way. Thus far in history, this kind of global change has never ended without a global conflict. We established the United Nations precisely in order to prevent such a conflict in future.Less than 20 years ago, we witnessed events that shocked our human conscience: genocide in Rwanda, Mongolia firmly supports non-proliferation and the complete elimination of weapons of mass destruction. We cannot tolerate the use of chemical weapons and strongly condemn any violation of universally accepted international law. This morning I participated in the High-level Meeting on Nuclear Disarmament (see ). As a country with internationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free-status, uniquely situated between two nuclear-weapon States that are permanent members of the Security Council, Mongolia has been working hard on nuclear disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.As a result of our efforts, the five nuclear-weapon States, permanent members of the Security Council, have issued a joint declaration recognizing Mongolias unique status. They pledged to respect that status and not to contribute to any act that would violate it. Their joint commitment ensures that we will not be used as a pawn in any future nuclear plans or strategies. That is Mongolias contribution to greater confidence and stability in the region.Strengthening peace and stability in North-East Asia is one of Mongolias national security priorities. We firmly believe that dialogue and open discussions foster confidence. We have therefore put forth an initiative: the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on North-East Asia Security. We invite the other States of the region to jointly address various issues of common interest, including security issues in North-East Asia.Mongolian military officers and troops are honoured to serve along with their fellow United Nations peacekeepers to maintain international peace and security. We are very proud of our peacekeepers for their dedicated service and their invaluable contributions to the cause of peace.We all know the complexity of contemporary conflicts. Our peacekeepers are serving in areas with high security threats and risks. To support and encourage our peacekeepers, last February I took a trip to South Sudan and visited the United Nations Mission there. During my visit, I met the President of South Sudan and offered my support to him and to his nation, the youngest member of the international community.Let us make our world safer and more prosperous. Let us be fearless when it comes to fighting for fairness, transparency and the rule of law. Where there is the rule of law, there is less corruption and more human rights. witnessed too many divisions in the Council, which have impeded its ability to act in a timely manner. Decisive progress in Security Council reform is required to improve the Councils efficiency, transparency and accountability. As part of that effort, the permanent members should consider refraining from the use of the veto in situations of genocide, crimes against humanity and serious violations of international humanitarian law.We call upon the Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. The International Criminal Court is an essential pillar in the system of international justice and a powerful tool to ensure accountability and to fight against impunity for the most serious crimes. It deserves our full support.We must focus more closely on addressing the root causes of conflicts and expand our work on prevention. In particular, we must improve our ability to read the warning signs and trigger early action. The consequences of inaction far outweigh any risks that might arise from timely prevention and response, in terms both of money and — more important — human suffering and lives. That was a lesson learned in our neighbouring region, the Western Balkans. Enhancing mutual trust through open political dialogue is a prerequisite for peaceful coexistence and long-term stability there. Slovenia and Croatia have therefore launched the Brdo process as a forum for high-level dialogue intended to strengthen relations and reconciliation among the countries of the region.The past century was a very dark chapter in Europe and in human history. In August 2014, we will commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War. It brought about mass destruction of human life and new methods of warfare that were subsequently condemned by the civilized world. It was followed by the Second World War, and the century ended with a decade of intra-State conflicts and genocides that caused untold human suffering. Let us use our conscience and humanity as the weapon of choice, for everyone deserves to live in dignity and peace, feeling safe, with access to food and drinking water and with a decent job and adequate pay for it. Yet something so obvious seems to be very far from reality. It is our task to bring reality closer to our dreams.followed by genocide in Srebrenica and Darfur. We should have learned lasting lessons from those horrific events. We vowed never to let that happen again. We collectively endorsed the responsibility to protect human beings from mass atrocities and gross and systematic violations of human rights, and yet we have failed again. We are faced with another human tragedy unfolding before our eyes in Syria. After more than two years of brutal violence against civilians, including women and children, we still have not found a political solution within the framework of the United Nations. Not only is the unconscionable use of chemical weapons in Syria considered a war crime, it is an assault against our common humanity. Sovereignty as responsibility implies that States are responsible for the well-being of their citizens. It does not give them a licence to kill their own citizens. If States manifestly fail to protect their populations, the international community has a duty to react. When faced with mass atrocities, indifference is not, and cannot represent, an option. The report of the United Nations inspectors was clear, credible and impartial. The United States-Russian agreement on the framework for the elimination of Syrian chemical weapons must be implemented without delay. Syrias accession to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction is a positive step. Syria should comply immediately and fully, or face the consequences. It is important that diplomacy prevailed and referred the issue back to the United Nations and the Security Council. The Security Council should live up to its responsibility and use all appropriate measures to comprehensively address the situation in Syria. Reaching a political settlement remains the only viable and lasting solution to the crisis and to ensuring stability in the region. We support the timely convening of the “Geneva II” conference.The Security Council has the primary responsibility to maintain international peace and security under the Charter of the United Nations. It exercises that responsibility on behalf of all of us. It has an obligation to deliver and to fulfil the mandate entrusted to it by the international community. In this period of tensions and challenges, the responsibility of the major Member States is especially great. In recent years we have journey and a future project leading towards further horizons. What we must take into consideration is the element of time. Nations require decades to gain control of their revolutions and achieve their success or failure. We must remember that the Arab Spring, like all human projects, may stumble or come to a standstill — indeed, may fail. Our duty — the duty of those here — is to persist in support of that journey and to begin afresh after each obstacle. We believe that the difficulties involved in building democracy in the Arab Spring countries are only natural and will be overcome. Our peoples will never accept regimes that shackle them. We want to fight extremism cloaked in religion, not replace it with dictatorship cloaked in nationalism or patriotism. Those difficulties do indeed reveal that political, social and ideological forces are pushing countries this way and that; building democracy and civil institutions is replete with difficulties in all Arab Spring countries.From this rostrum, I would like to speak to the current authorities in Egypt and call on them to release President Mohammed Morsi and all political detainees. Only a bold initiative such as that has the potential to end the political tensions, stop the violence and bring all the parties back to a dialogue as the only means to solve all the difficult problems caused by the current transitional phase.The restriction of movement of goods and persons is increasing the difficulties faced by the struggling people of Gaza under Israeli occupation and colonization.Tunisia is dealing with three challenges. That of terrorism, as exemplified by the killing of the two martyrs, Shukri Belaid on 6 February and Mohamed Brahimi on 25 July, is a major political challenge that has impeded the work on the Constitutional Council. The second is the fact of slowing domestic and foreign investment. The third is that we are having to learn democracy at the same time that we are building and defending it. It has not yet taken root in our political and social traditions or our general culture. In Tunisia we have many of the elements necessary for success — a responsible and conscious political class that has continued to pursue dialogue, a legitimate, disciplined and professional army and a people who are peaceful and politically aware and who understand what is in their own interests.I would like to assure the Assembly that the Arab Spring in Tunisia will continue and succeed. We Todays world leaders have a unique opportunity, possibility and responsibility to influence our common future for many decades to come. That is why it is important not to lose focus on the successful implementation of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and to agree on the post-2015 agenda. Let us transform our vision of saving future generations from the scourge of war into reality. We have no time to spare. We have no right to fail."}}
