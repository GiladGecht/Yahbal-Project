{"speech":{"0":" It is a great pleasure for me to have this opportunity to join my fellow Heads of State and Government at the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We wish to offer our profound congratulations and support to the President of the Assembly. We also wish to express the Kingdoms sincere appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his entire staff for their efforts and the role they continue to play in improving the working mechanisms of the United Nations and for being such a good host.The United Nations has brought hope to those who are suffering, which is one of the pillars of its Charter. The fundamental purpose of the United Nations is to promote tolerance among humankind so that nations can live together in peace with one another. We are pleased that the United Nations has always worked hard to promote and maintain international security, and it has further taken positive action to prevent and remove threats to the peace that humankind so desires. We are also cognizant of the fact that humankind is facing a test of unprecedented proportions in hotspots that continue to pose a huge challenge for the United Nations to address.We have been deeply saddened by the senseless killing of innocent people that took place this week in Nairobi. We condemn such acts of terrorism in the strongest terms. We send words of comfort to the Government and the families who lost loved ones through that tragic and senseless violence. The world needs to stand together and wipe terrorism from the competence, a lack of corruption and the primacy of the interest of the country as a whole over particular interests, whether they are political or economic. The entire notion of good governance is spelled out in a resolution of the Human Rights Commission initiated by Poland in the late 1990s. Only with good governance in place can international aid bring about desirable results in combating poverty and taking the route of sustainable growth.Poland is an active participant in the international community, and not just through its bilateral relations and membership regional organizations such as the European Union, or supra-regional ones such as NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. We are also trying to create a better international order by being active in the United Nations. Poland, an unflinching believer in the purposes and principles of the United Nations, is convinced that it is necessary to respect the treaties and commitments made by the Organization — by us — and supports institutions and programmes that facilitate their implementation. For years, one of the priorities of our policy has been the promotion of human rights and democracy. Poland currently holds the presidency of the Human Rights Council. The European Endowment for Democracy was established on Polands initiative as well. Our countrys share in development aid is growing, particularly within the European Union. Next November, Warsaw will host the climate summit, where we will preside over the most important development process, namely, that of climate-related negotiations.Poland has always been active in efforts aimed at ensuring the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, particularly chemical weapons. Drawing on our experience and rich relations with other countries, we wish to continue to contribute to reinforcing international peace and security. That is why we are seeking a seat on the Security Council for the period 2018-2019. We believe that as a member of the Security Council, we will be able to help achieve the purposes and principles of the United Nations, as well as represent the interests of Member States in line with the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations."}}
