{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, I would like, on behalf of the Head of State, the Head of Government and the people of Togo, to congratulate the General Assembly on the occasion of its sixty-eighth session. I wish to warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your elесtiоn to the presidency of the General Assembly and to assure you of Togos full willingness to support your actions throughout your mandate. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who continues to take bold initiatives to enable the Organization to effectively fulfil its mandate in promoting peace and sustainable development.The theme that you have chosen for the sixty-eighth session, “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”, is indicative of the particular attention that the countries of the South give to development issues. At the same time, it is an invitation to the United a democratic society capable of guaranteeing to every citizen, without exception, the peace, harmony, well-being, justice and freedom that are prerequisites for our societys full f lourishing and that must go hand in hand with our economic and social development goals.For nearly a decade, the Government of Togo has adopted a policy of dialogue and consensus in managing State affairs. It is in that context that it has continued to urge the countrys political class to engage in dialogue in order to ensure that election processes are definitively free of violence and that the new cycle of peaceful political life becomes more solidly entrenched. Thus, in addition to the reshuffling that has taken place since May 2012, following the recommendations of the electoral observation missions, particularly that of the European Union, new measures have been adopted. They have to do with the reorganization of the national independent electoral commission, the new electoral code and laws on electoral districting, the financing of political parties and the status of the opposition. Those measures enabled us to hold free, democratic, transparent and calm elections to the legislature on 25 July.This is the moment for me to thank all the partners who supported my country throughout the process, as well as the various observation missions, which, on the completion of their work, expressed their satisfaction with the good conduct of the elections. The new Parliament that emerged from the elections will continue with the institutional and constitutional reforms stipulated in the global political agreement signed in Lome in August 2006 between the Government and the political parties, in order to ensure that Togo will finally possess an institutional framework that strengthens democracy and the rule of law and consolidates our economic and social gains. Similarly, the Government elected in the legislative elections of 25 July has been given the primary mandate of stepping up its work in priority social areas such as health, education, access to safe drinking water and sanitation, and youth employment.That road map keeps the 2015 deadline in view as it seeks first and foremost to continue Togos efforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals in the established time frame. Our new frame of reference for development in the medium term, the strategy for accelerated growth and job promotion, reflects that determination to focus squarely on the MDGs. Togo is fully aware that effective achievement of the their policies in order to further integrate economic, social and environmental factors at all levels and across all disciplines, to ensure sustainable development across the board. And indeed, to achieve sustainable development, there must be, at the national and international levels, conditions conducive to continuing and strengthening international cooperation in areas such as debt, trade, technology transfer, innovation and entrepreneurship and capacity-building .Achieving the MDGs is one of the Togolese Governments priorities. Enormous efforts have been made to significantly reduce poverty in the country. In the field of education, the introduction of free primary education since 2008 has encouraged an increase in school enrolment, especially among young girls.With regard to health issues, the HIAIDS prevalence rate has been reduced by half. The care of infected people has improved considerably, and more than 26,000 patients are cared for by the State. The integrated programme providing vaccination, the distribution of insecticide-treated mosquito nets and improved nutrition has yielded promising results in the area of maternal and child health.In addition, significant progress has been made in other areas of development, including agriculture, which, thanks to a far-reaching and ambitious national agricultural investment programme and food security, has contributed to reducing poverty, hunger and food insecurity.The progress achieved by Togo received recognition from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in the form of an award made by that Organization during the thirty-eighth FAO Conference in June in Rome.On the social front, for some years now the Government of Togo has been taking proactive measures enabling us to tackle in a sustained way the problems of joblessness and underemployment among young people and their marginalization in decision-making. Among them I can point to a national youth council, a national volunteer programme, the creation of a support fund for youth economic initiatives and a support programme for the integration and development of employment opportunities.The Government of Togo, aware of the great challenges of the twenty-first century, is continuing to work with faith and determination to gradually build actions in order to achieve the results we welcome today. From this rostrum, Togo, which is currently chairing the West African Economic and Monetary Union, of which Mali is a member, would like to reiterate the communitys pleasure at this success of the highly diverse Malian people, who demonstrated their political maturity and the ability to overcome their differences in the national interest.In accordance with its ongoing commitment to peace, security and stability, internationally and in the West African subregion in particular, Togo continues to work within the entities and institutions of which it is a member and, through its MINUSMA contingent, to contribute to helping the Government of Mali. That is why my country invites the community of nations to continue to support Mali on the road to rebuilding both the infrastructure that was destroyed in the north of the country and its economic development, which was severely damaged in the crisis.There are other situations in Africa that deserve our close attention by reason of the degree to which they contribute to the continents insecurity and undermine our efforts to achieve the MDGs. The Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Libya and many other countries are currently sources of concern, since peace and security are still tenuous in those brotherly countries. While we commend the bold actions that have already been taken to halt those conflicts, we would like to urge the international community to continue to work to that end alongside the African Union, which has made extraordinary efforts to overcome all the obstacles to the continents economic rebirth.Among the scourges that have the potential to slow African States development is that of transnational organized crime, whose pernicious impact on our economies is clear. Where the States of the Gulf of Guinea are concerned, piracy and armed robbery on the high seas have recently become a new type of scourge that is more and more worrying and whose seriousness demands general involvement and a strong, firm and uncompromising response on the part of the international community as a whole, as well as the countries concerned.In that regard, my country, which is currently a member of the Security Council, welcomes the commitment whereby the Council has included the issue in its agenda, on the initiative of our States. The Councils position has enabled the United Nations MDGs requires resources. That is why we are actively committed to promoting good governance.Under that heading fall our strategic plan for mobilizing the Togolese diaspora, our accession to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, the establishment of a regulatory authority for public contracts in order to improve the business climate, the restructuring of public enterprises and the finance sector and especially the establishment of a revenue office responsible for the collection of both customs and tax receipts. None of this progress and success would have been possible for Togo without the support of our development partners, whom we would like to thank once again, and to whom we turn for increased support within the framework of the partnerships that bind us together.Togo remains deeply convinced that our efforts to meet the targets we set ourselves through the MDGs cannot succeed in isolation. While every State has its own challenges, the international community must commit to working on them collectively, owing to the interdependence that is the hallmark of todays world. In the face of accelerating global change, worsening insecurity and the urgency of finding a collective solution to the challenges our Organization is dealing with, I can assure the Assembly that Togo remains committed to seeking a vision of a united, integrated world where every State must cooperate to promote peaceful coexistence and good neighbourliness and to combat poverty and underdevelopment in all its forms, as well as political, ideological, ethnic and religious intolerance.Here I would like to touch on the case of Mali, where the danger represented by terrorist groups and extremist jihadists, coupled with a serious humanitarian crisis, prompted the United Nations to action with a speedy military intervention and peacekeeping operation. In that regard, the adoption of an integrated United Nations strategy for the Sahel, in the months after Security Council resolution 2100 (2013) established the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), has been crucial. The holding of the presidential elections on 28 July and 3 August was an unquestionable success not only for the Malian people and their leaders but also for the international community.Togo is pleased that regional and subregional organizations, along with the international community, were able to speak with one voice and coordinate their In conclusion, I would like to emphasize, with regard to the MDGs, the need to stay the course, regardless of the results achieved by each individual State. Better yet, the international community must be more ambitious in the goals that it will establish for the post-2015 period, because, given the challenges of the contemporary world, it is no longer simply a matter of reducing the proportion of persons suffering from hunger, malnutrition and endemic diseases. Our aim must be to eradicate them. Only by mobilizing all our efforts in the pursuit of those very important goals will we increase our chances of actually achieving them."}}
