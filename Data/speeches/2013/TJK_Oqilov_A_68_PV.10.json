{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, I would like to join with those expressing their cordial congratulations to Mr. John Ashe on his election to serve as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I am convinced that his extensive professional experience will contribute to the efficient and successful work of this session. I would also like to express our appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremic, for his efforts as President at the previous session.We fully share the commitment of this session to contributing to the development of a post-2015 global development agenda in order to enhance the progress already achieved towards the full implementation of the decisions taken at the Rio de Janeiro United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20).The modalities of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development were approved at the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly, and its first meeting took place some days ago here in New York. We expect the Forum, which replaces the Commission on Sustainable Development, to become a universal and effective platform for regular dialogue and for reviewing achievements and developing and coordinating the programme of actions aimed at promoting sustainable development.Further progress in achieving sustainable development depends in many respects on the adequate and timely financing of the planned programmes and projects. In that regard, the activities of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing, which is mandated to develop Experience shows that it is impossible to achieve development goals without ensuring reliable and universal access to energy. The United Nations Decade of Sustainable Energy for All (2014-2024) provides a unique opportunity for the practical implementation of that aim. We believe that, along with ensuring reliable and sustainable access to energy, it is essential to encourage and promote in every way possible increased use of renewable energy, the transfer of advanced technologies and a more efficient energy supply and energy saving. Tajikistan, which is experiencing economic and population growth, lacks large oil and gas deposits but has huge hydropower potential. It is making every effort to develop all aspects of power generation, on which the populations well-being critically depends. Our Government is undertaking additional efforts to make full use of its own potential when it comes to addressing socioeconomic issues. On 2 March, Tajikistan successfully completed the negotiation process and joined the World Trade Organization as the one hundred and fifty-ninth member of that multilateral system for regulating world trade. We are interested in advancing the trade interests of developing countries, including those of landlocked countries. In that context, on 16 and 17 September in Dushanbe, the tenth annual meeting of the Intergovernmental Commission for the Transport Corridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia was held. That meeting was followed on 18 September by the High-level International Conference on Development of Road Transport and Transit Potential in Central Asia for the period up to 2023. Those events made an additional contribution to the process of preparing for the 10-year comprehensive review of the implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action.Effective regional cooperation can provide considerable support to the establishment of a new global partnership for achieving sustainable development. In our region, the development of multidimensional cooperation depends in many respects on strengthening peace and stability in Afghanistan. We support the efforts of the Government of Afghanistan and the international community to address the challenges of the transition period, reconciliation and post-conflict rehabilitation in Afghanistan. We believe that socioeconomic development is the key to achieving lasting peace in that country. International aid to Afghanistan should be, above all, aimed at promoting participants at the High-level International Conference on Water Cooperation, organized by the Government of Tajikistan in cooperation with the United Nations on 20 and 21 August in Dushanbe. I would like to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to the President of the General Assembly, the Secretary-General and all our partners — Member States and international and regional organizations — for their active participation in the work of that successful Conference. Based on the outcomes of the Conference, the Dushanbe Declaration of the High-level International Conference on Water Cooperation and the Dushanbe framework for action on water cooperation were issued and circulated among Member States as documents of the General Assembly. In his statement at the opening ceremony of the Dushanbe Conference, the President of the Republic of Tajikistan, Mr. Emomali Rahmon, proposed the development of a post-2015 vision for global water, which could serve as the road map for the implementation of the water-related sustainable development goals. We would like to call upon all delegations to support that initiative.It is common knowledge that water resources are central to the achievement of the development goals set forth in the Millennium Declaration (resolution ). Our efforts at poverty eradication directly depend on the rational management of water resources. The efforts undertaken have not yet produced the large-scale effects that we all expected at the dawn of the Millennium. However, the progress is obvious. According to The Millennium Development Goals Report 2013, over the past two decades, more than 2.1 billion people have received access to improved drinking water supplies and 1.9 billion people improved their sanitation conditions. Despite those statistics, 768 million people are still using water from unsafe sources and about 2.5 billion people do not have access to basic sanitation. Moreover, the level of progress differs, not only in regions and countries, but also in rural and urban areas within the same country.The special General Assembly event that took place recently in New York provided another opportunity for a sound assessment of progress and identification of ways to accelerate implementation of the MDGs and do so with maximum success. That is particularly important under current circumstances, when the financial, economic, food and energy crises and climate change undermine the current still unsustainable and uneven progress in the implementation of MDGs. in this field are the strengthening of international mechanisms for the protection of human rights, the bona fide implementation of the commitments assumed and the promotion of multilateral cooperation in the field of human rights protection. We view the Human Rights Council as an important forum for constructive dialogue and cooperation in the field of human rights.Guided by the desire to make a contribution to an open and fair dialogue in the field of human rights, Tajikistan has for the first time decided to put forward its candidature for the Human Rights Council for the period 2015 to 2017. We hope that Tajikistans candidature for that period will receive support at the election to be held during the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly, in the fall of 2014.In conclusion, I would like to note that the entire range of long-term goals requires a clear and sound review of the actions under way towards a transition towards sustainable development. We are convinced that the United Nations, as the unique, universal mechanism for multilateral cooperation, must remain the centre of coordination of our collective efforts to ensure peace, security, development and human rights. Meanwhile, the role of the United Nations itself must be strengthened through comprehensive reform and by enhancing its ability to rapidly and adequately respond to problems, effectively meet the numerous global challenges and counter threats."}}
