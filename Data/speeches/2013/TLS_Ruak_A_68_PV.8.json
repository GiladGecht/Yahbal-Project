{"speech":{"0":" Allow me to begin by conveying my vigorous condemnation of the recent terrorist attacks in Kenya, Pakistan and Iraq, which killed scores of innocent people. On behalf of the Government of Timor-Leste, I extend our deepest condolences to the bereaved families in connection with the senseless loss of their loved ones. Terrorism is contrary to every civilized value we hold dear and for which we have fought. It must be condemned in all its manifestations, regardless of its motives.This is the first time that I am addressing this Assembly of representatives of the international community as a whole. I take this occasion to once again thank the United Nations for its contribution to the realization of the right of the people of Timor-Leste to decide on our own future. Timor-Lestes experience shows the great value of the United Nations and the importance of negotiated solutions, dialogue and diplomacy to international disputes.This is the first year without a United Nations mission in the country since the restoration of Timor-Lestes independence 11 years ago. Our partnership with the United Nations throughout the last decade achieved remarkable successes. The Timorese peoples yearning for stability and peace was decisive for the new circumstances, which allowed the Security Council to remove Timor-Leste from its agenda.The results obtained are shared jointly by the international community, through their solidarity and pioneering efforts in the nation-building processes made in Timor-Leste, and by the Timorese people, through their maturity and firm determination to live Turning our attention to international matters whose urgency especially appeals to our conscience, my country has witnessed with horror the growing violence in Syria. We welcome the agreement that was reached to put Syrias arsenal of chemical weapons under United Nations control prior to its destruction. Timor-Leste rejects the use of chemical weapons in all circumstances. We are in favour of dialogue in the search for negotiated solutions, with the involvement of the United Nations. Only negotiation can help save lives and alleviate the high toll that the Syrian people are paying in human lives and social upheaval, which has resulted in millions of internally displaced persons and refugees.In Timor-Leste, we know only too well the losses and traumas of war. We are committed to preventing violence in all its forms. Earlier this month, our Prime Minister, Mr. Kay Rala Xanana Gusmao, joined the Champions initiative to end sexual violence in conflict, supporting the corresponding action launched by the United Nations.In a world undergoing a rapid transition towards globalization, the Security Council must upgrade its ability to effectively respond and must adjust its composition to better reflect the realities of the twenty-first century. New Powers, including India, Indonesia and Brazil, among others, must be granted permanent member status in the Security Council. At the same time, my country is aware of the need for a better representation of medium-sized and small countries with relevant contributions to stability and peace. In that spirit, Timor-Leste supports New Zealands candidacy for a non-permanent seat at the Security Council for the 2015-2016 term. New Zealand has actively worked with us for peace and security in Timor-Leste, and we believe it will both enhance the representation of small States and be a constructive bridge-builder at the Council.On 30 August, Timor-Leste celebrated the fourteenth anniversary of the referendum supervised by the United Nations that allowed the Timorese people to realize their right to self-determination and independence. In contrast, there are peoples who, after decades, continue to patiently wait for the realization of that right. Such is the case of the Sahrawi people. A stable and lasting solution for Western Sahara cannot exist without the democratic expression of the will of its people.to the establishment of more innovative and effective international relations and cooperation.The latest report on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) states that most countries will not achieve all the MDGs, and that is particularly true in the case of fragile and conflict-affected States. The international community as a whole must draw lessons from that as we plan for the future. Many of the worlds poorest have been left behind, including around 1.5 billion people across the globe who live in areas affected by fragility and conflict. That is why the g7+ countries came together with the following vital message: without peace there can be no development and without development there can be no peace. And to add a further dimension to that, there can be neither peace nor development without inclusive and responsive State institutions that are capable of being responsive and attending to peoples needs.At the regional level, we have established friendly relations with neighbouring countries in South-East Asia and the Pacific, in particular with Australia and Indonesia, our closest neighbours, with whom we maintain intense cooperation. The process of reconciliation between Timor-Leste and Indonesia and the excellent relations that our two countries have developed represent a model whose lessons are useful and relevant beyond our borders and outside our region.Timor-Leste has submitted its application for membership in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. We have developed friendly relations with all member States of that organization, which makes relevant contributions to stability in our region. Our country is a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and a special observer at the Pacific Islands Forum. We play an active role in and are committed to multilateral processes, which are important for regional stability and security.The unanimous election of Timor-Leste to chair the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific by the countries members of that United Nations body reflects my countrys harmonious international integration. As a member of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, we will have the honour of chairing that organization in the period 2014-2016. Timor-Leste believes in making its voice directly heard in every multilateral forum of relevance to our national interest and will submit an application for membership in the Commonwealth of Nations. promote improving food security and the fight against malnutrition, it will not be possible to make rapid and sure progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals. The new objectives are defined in the post-2015 development agenda, due to be launched by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.Timor-Leste is following, with great interest, the post-2015 development agenda process and was honoured by the invitation to Dr. Emilia Pires, our Minister of Finance, to participate in the High-level Panel that drafted a proposal for the agenda, following a request by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.The past experience of the Timorese people and the countrys liberation struggle, in which we were engaged for 24 years, have demonstrated that only tolerance, dialogue and mutual respect, which the Timorese resistance consistently showed and I have consistently supported — in short, veneration for the dignity of people — will allow us to reach durable solutions to disputes between countries.In a world where challenges are rapidly becoming globalized, requiring concerted and effective responses, the actions of the United Nations are more than ever essential for the stability of international relations. Timor-Leste will continue to show its commitment to the United Nations, so that the Organization may better respond to the desires of Member States and the challenges they face, and to unhesitatingly assert the values of peace and mutual respect. I wish the Assembly the best of luck in its work. "}}
