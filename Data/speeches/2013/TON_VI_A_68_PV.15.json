{"speech":{"0":" As this is my first time addressing the General Assembly as Head of State, I wish to sincerely congratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I assure him that the Tongan delegation will be fully supportive and cooperative under his very able leadership. I also wish to commend the stewardship of his predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremic, during the sixty-seventh session. I express my gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his persevering guidance and energetic leadership in further enhancing the profile and work of the United Nations in the face of unprecedented global challenges.Tonga welcomes the timely theme for the general debate, “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”, and the inclusion of a set of six thematic issues of focus for high-level events and thematic debates during the sixty-eighth session. Indeed, Tonga joins other small island developing States (SIDS) in affirming that priorities in the outline of the post-2015 development agenda should, with increased cooperation among Member States, ref lect the outcome of the 2014 Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States, to be convened in Samoa.Tonga supports the proposed high-level event that would address the needs of women, youth and civil society and contribute to development goals. It applauds the high-level event on the contribution of human rights and the rule of law to the post-2015 framework and hails the twentieth anniversary of the Vienna Conference on Human Rights. Earlier this year, Tonga submitted its second universal periodic review, which was adopted by the Human Rights Council. The next review for Tonga is scheduled for 2017-2018.The high-level event, centring on South-South and triangular cooperation, including information and communication technology, is appreciated as adding value to the realization of development targets. Tonga hosted the annual Pacific Islands Chapter of the Internet Conference earlier this month to celebrate the emergence of high-speed Internet connectivity in Tonga. The Conference showcased the achievements of the Pacific region in accessing opportunities for Internet users and demonstrated how Tonga can best to global peace and security unless appropriate steps are taken to eradicate them. Meeting such challenges today calls for sincerity and honesty to mount well-coordinated and concerted global efforts.The Gambia firmly believes that socioeconomic development and respect for the sovereign rights of countries to control their own natural resources, especially minerals, should be the collective line of defence for a collective global security system that takes the sovereignty of each nation seriously. Combating poverty will not only save millions of lives but also strengthen States capacities to combat terrorism, organized crime and intra-State conflict. We need renewed and genuine global partnerships and commitments that are binding and based on respect for the sovereign right of each individual State to choose a way of life that is based on its religious and cultural values, as no administrative system is better than the way prescribed by the almighty Allah.It is also necessary to increase the credibility and effectiveness of the Security Council by making sure that selective justice is abandoned and rejected by all Members of the United Nations family. From all indications, there is an imperative need to inject new ideas and impetus into the Security Council and to expand its membership to reflect current geopolitical realities. Moreover, respect for the principle of equal sovereign rights of peoples and the need to promote and respect peaceful relations among all States, rich or poor, black or white, should be the overriding considerations for the peaceful coexistence of Member States — that is, if 2015 and beyond is to bequeath a peaceful and prosperous world to future generations of the human race."}}
