{"speech":{"0":" On behalf of my country, Tunisia, and the Tunisian people, I greet the Assembly and all those around the world represented here.On 17 December 2010, Tunisia, as the Assembly knows, was the first country to experience the Arab Spring, the peaceful revolutions of Arab peoples aimed at ridding themselves of corrupt dictatorships hampering the economic, political and social progress of their countries. Such dictatorships had imposed with brutal force corrupt regimes that had swept away basic human civilization. What has now been seen in some Arab Spring countries may lead some to believe that those efforts at liberation have failed and that the dream has become a nightmare.What we must remember is that the Arab Spring is not a final stage, something that can be achieved overnight. It is, rather, just the beginning of a liberation to protecting people against dictatorships, particularly the Syrian dictatorship, which is an extreme example of how immorally a regime can behave.We are fully confident that had the Court been able to act, the Syrian regime would not have attempted to turn the presidency of the country into rule-by-heredity, limiting ruling to one party only. It would not have dared to convict members of opposition political parties and sentence them to death. Imagine if the Court had been able to act in such cases. What if the Court had been able to pursue a course in favour of human rights? Imagine how we could have avoided the nightmare that the Syrian people has been going through — 100,000 dead and 7 million displaced persons, with a regime killing men, women and children with all the weapons at its disposal, including chemical weapons. Have we ever seen such a brutal regime by an individual person who came to power through force and falsification and who is fighting a barbarous civil war that has set the stage for ugly scenes beyond any ever seen in the history of the region? The regime ought to be brought to the ICC. Justice delayed still cannot bring millions of dead back to life. There have to be preventive bodies that can take up such situations from their very beginning. Regimes like that of Syria cannot last long against internal democratic opposition and the lack of international recognition. Tunisia therefore calls on all democratic States that wish to build institutions that counter the rise of dictatorships to support our project. We believe that such a constitutional court would be the expression of a new spirit needed by the international community.We are meeting in this place with all the nations of the world to review the worlds problems, many of which are foreseeable and bring great pain to people. We would have been able to avoid such situations had we adopted the slogan “Think globally and act locally.” As a medical doctor, I would recall that we were able to conquer epidemics that raged against humankind through efforts at prevention. Dictatorships, climate change and poverty must be thwarted internally and among peoples. In facing such epidemics, we must have preventive policies that save humankind. We hope to God that there is enough time for us to quickly take such a direction before it is too late."}}
