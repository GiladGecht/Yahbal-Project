{"speech":{"0":" I wish to start by extending our sincere congratulations to Mr. John Ashe on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, we had every reason to be optimistic about the future. With the end of the Cold War, the moral balance of the world shifted towards the pursuit of peace. A lasting peace is far more than the mere absence of war. We, the international community, understood the imperative of working together for a stable world order. We maintain our strong commitment to the universal principles of the United Nations system and, in a spirit of solidarity and cooperation, we develop effective international responses to the scourge of terrorism. Yet the most profound crises of our times have been emerging from internal conflicts. Such conflicts have been increasing in both frequency and magnitude. They are largely driven by the problem of political legitimacy, which leads the governed to withhold their consent and limits the prospects for domestic order. Leaders without political legitimacy share a common delusion. Instead of reading the future and leading transformation, they believe that they can buy time with irresponsible actions against their own people. Eventually, those domestic conflicts escalate into civil wars, such as the tragedy we are witnessing in Syria. The actions of those leaders have implications for peace and security beyond their own borders. If some leaders insist on defining their security in a way that inflicts insecurity upon other nations there can be no collective security. Today regional and international peace and security depend upon the maintenance of domestic order in each hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty in a single generation. I see it in the faces of young people everywhere who can access the entire world with the click of a button and who are eager to join the cause of eradicating extreme poverty, combating climate change, starting businesses, expanding freedom, and leaving behind the old ideological battles of the past. That is what is happening in Asia and Africa, it is happening in Europe and the Americas. That is the future that the people of the Middle East and North Africa deserve as well, one where they can focus on opportunity, instead of on whether they will be killed or repressed because of who they are or what they believe. Time and again, nations and people have shown a capacity to change, to live up to humanitys highest ideals, to choose a better history. Last month, I stood where 50 years ago Martin Luther King Jr. told America about his dream, at a time when many people of my race could not even vote for President. Earlier this year, I stood in the small cell where Nelson Mandela endured for decades, cut off from his own people and the world. Who are we to believe that todays challenges cannot be overcome, when we have seen what changes the human spirit can bring? Who in this Hall can argue that the future belongs to those who seek to repress that spirit, rather than to those who seek to liberate it? I know what side of history I want the United States of America to be on. We are ready to meet tomorrows challenges with you, firm in the belief that all men and women are in fact created equal, each individual possessed with a dignity and inalienable rights that cannot be denied. That is why we look to the future not with fear, but with hope. That is why we remain convinced that this community of nations can deliver a more peaceful, prosperous, and just world to the next generation. "}}
