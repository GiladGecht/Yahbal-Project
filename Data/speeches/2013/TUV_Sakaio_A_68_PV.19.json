{"speech":{"0":" It is a great honour and pleasure to participate in the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly on behalf of the people and the Government of Tuvalu. At the outset, I would like to congratulate the President on his new leadership responsibilities; he has all the blessings and support of Tuvalu. I also wish to thank and acknowledge with profound appreciation the outgoing President and the continued assistance and support given by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the specialized organizations and their respective heads and staff. We are particularly grateful for our membership in the United Nations following a successful sixty-seventh session.The new Government of Tuvalu, of which I am honoured to be Deputy Prime Minister, was elected two months ago. Just last week, the Government, in cooperation with development partners, launched a road map committing to mutual partnerships that will deliver and make a difference for the people of Tuvalu. The road map focuses on improving the delivery of vital basic services, strengthening good governance and enhancing local capacity to address Tuvalus unique vulnerabilities and respond effectively to the impacts of climate change.It is visionary and timely to focus our debate on the theme of “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” as we approach the end of a journey called the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We are now ready to chart a new path, which we are calling the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the post-2015 agenda. And as we do every fall, we have gathered to reaffirm our spirit for and commitment to a renewed multilateralism and genuine collective action and to reflect, assess, address and plan for how to realize the Charters principles of peace, justice, human rights, social progress and equal opportunity for all.However, our global efforts cannot be fully universal until the United Nations pragmatically recognizes the international contribution that the Republic of China on Taiwan has made and the responsibility it has undertaken to achieve the noble goals of the United Nations, as well as the MDGs and SDGs, thus improving the standards of living of millions all over the world. The Republic On Israel and Palestine, we support all international efforts for the two States to resume negotiations and achieve a just, lasting and sustainable peace.Solomon Islands remains an arms-free State. We note that the use of conventional and unconventional arms in the wrong hands threatens international peace and stability. Solomon Islands welcomes the recently adopted Arms Trade Treaty and hopes that major players in the arms trade will sign that international framework. That will strengthen the Treaty. Solomon Islands continues to follow and assess the Treatys progress.On the question of the Republic of China, Solomon Islands call for the Republics meaningful participation at United Nations specialized organizations. We would like to acknowledge the Republic of Chinas recent participation in the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as a guest of the organizations President. We recognize that as a first step. We continue to seek observer status for the Republic of China both at ICAO and at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Those requests mirror the observer status that the Republic of China currently enjoys at the World Health Assembly.Solomon Islands continues to serve on the United Nations Executive Board. We welcome the new Executive Director of UN-Women, Ms. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, and assure her of our cooperation. We note with concern that the UN-Women strategic plan for 2014-2017 is underfunded. We call for political and financial support for the plan. We support the Executive Directors call that priority be given to the economic empowerment of women in rural areas. We hope the Executive Board can also address UN-Womens representation vacuum in the Pacific. Gender violence remains an issue in Solomon Islands, and my country joins the international community in condemning sexual violence.We continue to seek an inclusive society. In partnership with an Australian entity, Solomon Islands organized national games for persons with disabilities in our country and other events. Although we still have a long way to go in creating a disability-friendly society, we remain determined to achieve that end.Let me close where I began. The post-2015 development agenda is our shared agenda. We must remain united and work as one, with one aim, to deliver not poverty; progress, not setbacks and regression; and empowerment, not constraint.Let me reflect on Tuvalus performance with respect to the MDGs as the deadline 2015 draws near. I am pleased to report that Tuvalu has made significant progress towards the achievement of its MDGs, despite the impact of the various global financial and economic crises on its small, vulnerable economy. In the 2012 MDG progress report, Tuvalu was assessed as being on track with respect to four of the MDGs: primary education, child mortality, maternal health and global partnership; as having the potential to achieve three MDG targets: gender equality, combating HIAIDS, and environmental sustainability; and as being unlikely to achieve the MDG on poverty.The attainment of the MDG on poverty is a formidable challenge for the fourth-smallest country in the world. Tuvalu is poorly endowed in terms of natural resources and has almost no productive capacity. Tuvalu is highly dependent on aid, leasing gratuities and rental incomes derived from its national assets — air, sea and its domain — and remittances. We will continue to seek the invaluable support and cooperation of the United Nations and the donor community in our pursuit of attaining the MDG on poverty as we approach 2015.Gender equality and the empowerment of women and youth is pursued at all levels of decision-making. In 2012, Tuvalu adopted a family protection bill that aims at safeguarding our women and girls against sexual and gender-based violence, domestic violence and rape. The bill has facilitated access to justice and improved the provision of services to women and girls who have been subject to discrimination and violence, whether in the public or the private sphere.Tuvalu is also fully committed to the strategic implementation of the outcomes of the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. As we approach the International Year of Small Island Developing States, in 2014, and the third International Conference on Small Island Developing States in Apia, Samoa, we urge the United Nations to ensure that SIDS status and SIDS-specific recognition are truly sanctioned in the Organizations bureaucracy. We have seen enough General Assembly resolutions that address SIDS issues in a vague and abstract way, and yet the entire United Nations of Chinas significant international participation in United Nations specialized agencies, including in the World Health Organization, UNESCO, UNICEF, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the International Maritime Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, is critical as we collectively advance towards the post-MDG era and enter the era of the sustainable development goals. Tuvalu also fully supports the lifting of the embargo against Cuba. That will allow the Republic of Cuba to further consolidate and enhance its cooperation with small island developing States (SIDS) like Tuvalu.Looking back at our MDG journey, we have come across a myriad of crises and challenges, both natural and man-made. We know where we have come from, we know our capacities and constraints in facing those crises and challenges, and we know the direction we are heading in. We give great attention to how to address the many persistent and ongoing issues in their entirety and in their many forms, as we approach the finish line for the MDGs.As we make the transition to the SDG stage and the post-2015 agenda, we take heed of the intrinsic lessons from the MDGs. First, the United Nations continues to be a beacon of hope and, through strategic advocacy and awareness campaigns, the Organization brings the real issues and current events into the consciousness of both the public and the membership in order to propel action and redress. Secondly, partnership is key to the success of this truly universal Organization. Working together cooperatively delivers much more that we can make happen on our own. Cooperation and collaboration with communities, businesses, think tanks, churches, philanthropists, regional groupings and not least each United Nations Member, reaffirms a true and sustainable union that should constitute the way forward for the SDGs.The United Nations Charter should be mirrored in our national goals and priorities. Our vision for the new SDGs and post-2015 agenda must reflect a membership that is striving for the same goals — a world that embodies peace, not conflicts and terrorism; hope, not despair; opportunities, jobs and prospects for a decent life, not unemployment and welfare dependence; security and freedom, not insecurity and totalitarianism; equality, not autocracy; unity, not divisiveness; good governance and leadership, not tyranny; sufficiency, contribution, however minuscule, to global efforts to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. If we SIDS in the Pacific can do it, surely others can, too. The world must save Tuvalu and the SIDS in order to save the whole planet. We urge perseverance, with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol as the primary international and intergovernmental instruments for negotiating the global response to climate change. We call on all parties to work diligently to reach a legally binding framework for curbing greenhouse-gas emissions at the upcoming nineteenth session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, in Warsaw. The framework should also include mechanisms dealing with climate-change-related loss, damages and insurance for SIDS, and should provide adequate and accessible financing for adaptation support to SIDS such as Tuvalu. Tuvalu also applauds and fully supports the leadership of the Secretary-General and his commitment to hosting a climate change summit next year.For Tuvalu, the climate change issue is predominantly linked to the oceans. For a nation surrounded by seas, an ocean SDG is pertinent, for obvious reasons. Seventy per cent of the planets surface is covered by oceans, which are the cornerstone of Earths life support system. The uncontrolled and increasing carbonization of our oceans and their biodiversity are genuine issues of concern and must be urgently addressed. At the same time, radioactive spillovers of land-based nuclear wastes into the oceans, especially those that have followed recent incidents, must be dealt with properly and prevented from happening again. Here, the principle that the polluter pays should be the basis for efforts to clean, mitigate and prevent contamination of the oceans.Tuvalu is currently heavily dependent on imported fuel and petroleum products for electricity generation and transportation requirements. That will continue in both the short and medium term. Many recommendations for alternative energy sources and technologies, whether solar, wind or wave, have been proposed but not fully implemented. Our energy sector has set itself the challenge of becoming 100 per cent renewable by 2020. We appreciate the support of the many donors we have had for alternative renewable sources of energy, assistance with formulating energy policy and promoting efficient energy sources. Science and technological capacity in Tuvalu also remain development agenda includes no specific treatment of SIDS. The 2014 SIDS Conference must be decisive on establishing special windows for partnerships on SIDS that are designed to ensure not only their sustainable development but also their long-term security and survival.Tuvalu appreciates the decision of the Economic and Social Council to defer consideration of Tuvalus graduation from the least developed country (LDC) category under the Istanbul Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011-2020. That said, however, Tuvalu humbly submits that while the threshold criteria of LDC graduation — the human development index, per capita gross national income and the economic vulnerability index — are well established, it would simply be irrational and irresponsible if application of any two of the three criteria was the only measure of consideration for graduation. Given Tuvalus extreme vulnerability as a SIDS, we believe that our failure to achieve a satisfactory EVI level carries more weight for us in considering our possible graduation from the LDC list.Climate change and sea-level rise have had dire consequences for Tuvalus situation. Our survival and security, and our childrens future livelihood, have been seriously compromised by the international communitys inaction on climate change. The fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis, has further confirmed to the world the stark predictions for SIDS like Tuvalu in the wake of climate change and sea-level rise. The challenge we put to the Assembly is, What else are we waiting for? What is the relevance of talking about post-MDGs and SDGs when the world continues to fail in its duty and obligations to urgently reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and provide genuine adaptation? Ensuring Tuvalus long-term security means saving the whole world.Climate change is no longer an environmental or political issue. It is a borderless security issue for humankind. Everyone must act to urgently reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and provide adaptation. Among the papers distributed to the Assembly is the 2013 Pacific Islands Forum Communique, which contains the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership, which Tuvalu strongly supports. Through the Majuro Declaration, the Pacific island leaders commit their full responsibility and leadership to making their own implementing the Millennium Development Goals. The world economic and financial crises are partially responsible for our straying from the charted path. However, they brought to light some of the underlying issues that had either been overlooked or underestimated and which turned out to be important for the overall success. We are all aware that, in the context of interdependence and the growing interconnectedness of the world economy, no country can achieve the Millennium Development Goals in isolation. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development enriched our understanding of the ways of achieving the overall progress towards the political, social and economic development.Armenia welcomes the inclusion of “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” as the main theme of our deliberations in the current session.(spoke in English)Despite the fact that most of us share the understanding that the elimination of violence and terror is essential for building peaceful, sustainable and prosperous societies, peace seems to remain an elusive phenomenon in many parts of the world. Armenia remains alarmed by the worsening of the humanitarian situation in Syria. The number of refugees Armenia continues to receive already exceeds 10,000, but tens of thousands of Syrian-Armenians remain in Syria, a country that had become their second home after the genocide of 1915, and they are struggling for their survival in unbearable conditions together with their fellow Syrians.Armenia welcomes the unanimous adoption yesterday of Security Council resolution 2118 (2013), based on the agreement reached in Geneva between Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov and United States Secretary of State Kerry. The resolution could lead to the elimination of chemical weapons and the exclusion of their use in Syria and pave the way for a political solution of the Syrian crisis, putting an end to the suffering of the Syrian people.It is our strong belief that there is no alternative to the peaceful solution of conflicts. The resolution of conflicts requires political will and determination. Three months ago, on 18 June the Presidents of the three co-Chair countries of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe underdeveloped, and we need relevant and simple technologies that can be made readily available and priced effectively, especially for LDCs and SIDS. The facilitative role of the United Nations as a repository of such technologies and practices within the Organizations networks and websites will prove highly beneficial.Finally, as we approach the end of the MDGs and embrace the SDGs, we must pay attention to the nations with special needs, the poorest and most vulnerable, in making every effort to meet the MDGs and achieve a smooth transition to the SDGs. The scale of the challenges can be addressed only by reforming ourselves — the United Nations and each Member country. Delivering on the future we need and on our sustainable goals, delivering more and delivering better, will require increasing doses of great effort and discipline, perseverance and courage, tolerance and harmonious coexistence, multilateralism and interdependence on the part of us, the peoples of the United Nations.In a couple of days, Tuvalu will celebrate its thirty-fifth year of independence. Can we tell our children and grandchildren a story of continued survival on our God-given peaceful islands? Or do we have to tell them that the world, under the United Nations, that noble body, can no longer save their future because of climate change and sea-level rise? As with great pride we celebrate the continuing vibrancy of democracy and the rule of law, and our political independence in Tuvalu, we also appeal to the world. Please save Tuvalu from climate change. Let the world save Tuvalu in order to save itself."}}
