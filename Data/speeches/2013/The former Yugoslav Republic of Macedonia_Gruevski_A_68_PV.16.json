{"speech":{"0":" Allow me to begin by congratulating It is difficult, I would say even impossible, for someone to find a legal justification for such an objection.The fact that the overwhelming majority of countries have recognized our constitutional name — the Republic of Macedonia — with more than 135 of them being United Nations Members, clearly shows that most of countries do not believe that the dispute has a justified basis, or if it does they denounce it. I believe that this issue was a created one, a classic case of politicization and an instrument that, approximately 20 years ago, was either supposed to make someone score some political points or, by creating an atmosphere of conflict, to bring about some strategic regional shifts, as well as to slow down the spread of freedom, democracy and the introduction of market economies in the Balkans.At the last session, the General Assembly discussed the rule of law, with all Member States unanimously agreeing that respect for internationally agreed norms and principles was a must. Unfortunately, norms are not always adhered to. The United Nations must be neither idle in that regard nor renege from its responsibility to counter any disrespect for the rule of law.The Republic of Macedonia became a United Nations Member in 1993 with an atypical membership condition, namely, the denial of its constitutional name. It was admitted with an interim country reference — an unprecedented event in history that was contrary to the provisions of international law. But we have endured all that, although it lingers to date as a problem.In 1995, under United Nations mediation, we signed an interim accord with Greece by which we changed our f lag and parts of our Constitution, while Greece undertook not to create obstacles to our NATO accession in 2008. Not only did Greece obstruct our act of accession to the international Organization itself, it also obstructed the processes for opening the membership procedures in another organization. For four years in a row, Greece has prevented the start of negotiations for our membership in the European Union. On the basis of our appeal concerning the obstructions of Greece with regard to our application for membership, in 2011 the International Court of Justice\\\\ — a principal organ of the United Nations established by States Members and located at The Hague — issued a judgment that Greece had violated international law by not adhering to the interim accord and that the Republic of Macedonia had not violated participating in international missions that safeguard freedom and democracy.With regard to one of the major issues — the crisis in Syria and the internal conflict that has created more than 100,000 victims and 2 million refugees — what is more troubling is that chemical weapons were used against the Syrian people while diplomatic efforts were under way, although their use is strictly prohibited under international law. That must not be tolerated. We are among the countries to have asked for an urgent investigation under the auspices of the Secretary-Generals mechanism for the investigation of the alleged use of chemical and biological weapons. Despite differing views, all member States of the Security Council and of the United Nations agree that to achieve a final resolution of the Syrian crisis, the political approach should be given a chance. It is therefore essential to focus maximum effort on revitalizing the search for a political settlement and to convene the “Geneva II” conference as soon as possible. The Syrian people deserve better days through decisive action by the international community that will end the violence and threats.The region of South-East Europe has entered a phase of positive development, and in general the national and regional primary objectives are either fulfilled or are within reach. Regional cooperation is expanding in a number of new fields. Despite such advances, certain long-standing unresolved or partly resolved bilateral issues are clearly having a negative impact on our present and immediate future. In the case of the Republic of Macedonia, that happens to be a serious obstacle to our agenda for integration into international organizations.The Republic of Macedonia is celebrating the twentieth anniversary of its United Nations membership with the still unresolved issues of the use of the name of my country, the Republic of Macedonia, and of the identity of my people, the Macedonian identity. Those questions emerged because of a dispute raised by our southern neighbour Greece, which opposes our name, which is our fundamental individual and collective right. The issue, which should have been promptly resolved among neighbours, partners and future allies, has lasted for 22 years. While being a very realistic problem for my people, this is an issue that I deeply believe is essentially hypothetical and does not have any basis in international law or in the United Nations acts. does not allow them to be called Macedonians or the language that they speak to be called the Macedonian language, despite the fact that for more than half a century there have been departments in universities throughout the world where the Macedonian language has been studied and it has been called the Macedonian language. It is the same as if somebody denied an individual the right to speak French, German, Polish, English, Dutch, Portuguese, Japanese, Hindi or any other language. The United Nations must not overlook the violation of the basic human right to decide ones own name, and should take action to enable the exercise of that right. In this particular case, the United Nations should take action that will lead to the settlement of the outstanding issues that Greece has with us.At the previous session, we debated preventive diplomacy and concluded that it should be an essential element of the international community. Therefore, the United Nations must not, and should not, stand aside in this process, which severely hinders Macedonias aspirations to a better future for its citizens. Commitment is necessary to make it possible for Greece to begin resolving this issue, because in the past two years there has been great inertness on the part of Greece. Although that is a result of objective reasons caused by its adverse economic situation, it also entails a strategic and tactical political element based on the analysis that prolonging the process of solving the dispute would contribute to the Republic of Macedonia being isolated in its positions, which are based on international law and values, and to its resignation to a kind of self-annihilation of the State and the nation by agreeing to be renamed. According to that line of thinking, with the lack of commitment in the discussions and the blocking of European and Euro-Atlantic integration that my country faces — integration that is directly hindered by the dispute despite our having met the standards required of us by the international multilateral organizations, NATO and the European Union — we would thus be prevented from joining and face the possibility of internal misunderstandings regarding the hindrance caused by our southern neighbour, and we would drop our guard in spite of the force of the arguments, which are on our side. It is true that by putting off the solution of the dispute, more challenges in the country and the region are created, and the tension becomes greater at certain moments. But it should be international law or the commitments it had agreed to. However, we were hindered again, notwithstanding the decision of the highest body of justice in the world, and that is apparent to the Assembly and its member countries.The United Nations was established in order to protect international law. There is no regulation of international law that restricts a country from calling itself as it wishes, or restricts its citizens from being able to be called and named as they wish. Naming is one of the five prerogatives of States, as well as an undisputed right of every Member country.Why do we need international law if we do not adhere to it? If we turn a blind eye to that injustice and obvious violation of international law, we will be directly responsible for breaking one of the principles of world peace and of the United Nations. We do not want that, nor can we allow it. If it were not for international law, anarchy would reign and the United Nations would become a debate club without any basic competencies. We do not want to participate in that, at the expense of everything, even to our own detriment.Not respecting international law also means having no respect for the 50 million victims that fought for it 70 years ago, as well as going against the decisions of our predecessors — the founders of the Organization. International law should not be a platitude, but rather should provide a solution to every challenge.According to international law, the Republic of Macedonia is entitled to decide on its own name and to use the word Macedonian to denote its ethnic identity. Settling our differences with our southern neighbour is our priority, but only and precisely within the United Nations resolutions that define the solution that is the subject of discussion, and by reaching a mutually acceptable solution. We should settle our differences in no other way, especially not by expanding those limits.Sixty-six years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, this dispute, unjustly imposed on us by Greece, violates one of the fundamental rights of the individual — the right to decide ones own name. Every representative of my people is denied the right to be called as they wish, as their mothers and fathers, grandparents and all other ancestors throughout history were called: Macedonian. In addition to disputing the constitutional name of my country — the Republic of Macedonia — Greece also disputes the identity of my citizens, that is, it Actions speak of the one who undertakes them. With our openness and with our justified initiative, we are showing that we wish for a solution to be found. However, our meetings must not be purely a formality; rather, they must have substance and must not create an alibi for not finding a solution. I am convinced that only a substantial commitment by the international community, above all by the United Nations, will lead to a solution, taking into consideration the basic documents of the United Nations on the rights of countries and individuals, the United Nations resolutions that defined the talks, agreements guaranteed by the United Nations, the decisions of United Nations bodies and international law as a whole.However, if there is no progress, the United Nations must not remain inactive and be satisfied with the status quo, as that would mean showing further irresponsibility. Aware of this already discouraging situation, the United Nations should help via its organs, through the General Assembly and the Security Council. It is on the basis of Security Council resolution 817 (1993) that we are in discussions with our neighbour to arrive at a solution that will free the identity of my country. Otherwise, the United Nations will be faced with failure again and will bear the responsibility for not having acted in accordance with its own principles and values. I do not want to spare anyone. We all have responsibility, including the Organization. Instead of assuming that responsibility, the Organization has accepted the comfort of remaining silent and not resolving the dispute; instead of defending itself, it has remained inactive with regard to the status quo, which is obviously creating problems and challenges for the region. It should start considering alternative scenarios and doing more to stimulate a solution to this long-standing dispute.I am confident that we have the capacity to jointly respond to the challenges. In the name of the people that we represent, we must assume responsibility for the present and the future. Assuming such responsibility means taking decisions, changing habits and reinforcing cooperation and prosperity, but it is something that can be done. That is the responsible way to proceed."}}
