{"speech":{"0":" In the year 2000, we met here and agreed on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for 2015. They are: Goal 1, the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger; Goal 2, achieving universal primary education; Goal 3, promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women; Goal 4, reducing child mortality; Goal 5, improving maternal health; Goal 6, combatting HIAIDS, malaria and other diseases; Goal 7, ensuring environmental sustainability; and Goal 8, developing a global partnership for development. As we can see, they cannot be sustainably achieved unless we achieve socioeconomic transformation. That means building a new society comprised of the middle class and the skilled working class out of the pre-capitalist societies that characterize underdeveloped countries. Our old society of traditional Africa had and has to undergo socioeconomic metamorphosis, just like the insects do, taking on new forms of life — egg, caterpillar, pupa, adult butterf ly or other insect, and so on — of the same organism. That means fewer people in agriculture than in industry and services, more people in urban centres than in rural areas, no illiteracy, and modern agriculture rather than subsistence traditional agriculture or uneconomic colonial cash crops that bring in little for the affected families. I hope that no one had imagined that we could sustainably attain the MDGs while maintaining a backward economy. A few days ago a tribute was delivered in a fire station in California. An electric bulb had been turned on for 100 years. It had been on for 100 years! How many millions of dollars have they taken from our pockets deliberately creating junk so that people will buy and buy and buy? But globalization means a brutal cultural change for our planet and for our life. That is what history demands from us. The entire material basis has changed and it has changed man. In our culture, we act as if nothing had happened. Instead of us controlling globalization, it controls us. Almost 20 years ago, we discussed the humble Tobin tax, which could not be applied at a global level. All of the banks with financial power rose up against it. Their private property and who knows how many other things would be harmed. However, that is the paradox. With talent and collective work, with science, step by step humankind can make deserts green; humankind can bring agriculture to the seas; humankind can develop agriculture that lives with salt water. If the power of humankind is focused on what is essential, it is infinite. Here we see the greatest sources of energy. What do we know about photosynthesis? Almost nothing. There is a great deal of energy in the world, if we work together to use it properly. It is possible to eliminate poverty from the planet. It is possible to create stability. It will be possible for future generations, if they begin to reason as a species and not just as individuals, to bring life to the galaxies and pursue this dream of conquest that we, human beings, have in our genes. But if those dreams are to come true, we will have to control ourselves or we will die. We will die because we are not capable of being at the level of the civilization that we have been developing with our efforts. That is our dilemma. We should not spend our time merely correcting the consequences. Let us consider the deep-rooted causes, the civilization of waste, the present civilization that is stealing time from human life and wasting it on pointless matters. Mr. Beck (Solomon Islands), Vice-President, took the Chair.Let us remember that human life is a miracle. Consider that human life is a miracle, that we are alive as a result of a miracle, and that nothing is more important than life. Our biological duty is, above all, to respect life, promote it, take care of it, reproduce it and understand that the species is our being. In Uganda, therefore, we were clear about all of those from the very beginning. It was not possible to talk of the MDGs sustainably without talking about those strategic bottlenecks. You could not sustainably base yourself on donor support to achieve the MDGs.In spite of the fact that a number of mistakes were made by some of our actors, Uganda will have achieved the following MDGs by 2015.First, eradicate extreme poverty and hunger — already achieved; second, achieve universal primary education — already achieved; third, promote gender equality — already achieved; fourth, reduce child mortality — already achieved; fifth, improve maternal health — achieving this one has been slow to be achieved because of mistakes on our side; sixth, combat HIAIDS, malaria and other diseases — we are on track to achieve this, except as concerns new AIDS infections, which have increased slightly; seventh, ensure environmental sustainability by increasing the electrification of the economy, so as to stop the cutting of forests for firewood and for primitive agriculture by modernizing agriculture and shifting a greater portion of the population towards industry, away from agriculture.We have been working on Goal 8, developing a global partnership for development, first and foremost by working for economic and political integration in Africa and for market access to the rest of the world on the basis of mutual advantage. The process of market integration in Africa has already started in the form of the East African Community, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the Southern African Development Community, the Economic Community of West African States and the Economic Community of Central African States.As part of the global partnership, we should be very careful not to lose the easing in global tensions that came with the end of the Cold War. In the Book of Matthew, Jesus says : “ By their their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles? Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.” (The Holy Bible, Matthew 7:16-20)We in Uganda discovered the following bottlenecks to socioeconomic transformation. The first is ideological disorientation. The second is a weak State — no army and a weak police, judiciary and civil service. The third is inadequate infrastructure, including inadequate electricity, lack of roads, lack of a railway system, lack of information and communications technology infrastructure, and so on. All of this means high costs for doing business in a given country. That scares away business, and without business there can be no employment, no production of goods and services and no expansion of the tax base. It is a vicious circle.The fourth bottleneck relates to human resources that are undeveloped on account of lack of education and poor health. An illiterate and unhealthy population cannot be the agent of socioeconomic transformation. The fifth is the issue of small internal markets resulting from the colonial balkanization of Africa. Those had to be worked on through regional market integration. One cannot sustainably produce if sufficient numbers of people do not buy ones goods.Sixth, a lack of industrialization and a failure to modernize services meant that we continued to export raw materials at 10 per cent or less of the final value of the final product, thereby losing money and jobs to the outside world. The lack of modern services meant that we could not attract tourists and had to import services from outside in the form of professional and medical services, inter alia, in addition to jobs not being created.Seventh, the failure to modernize agriculture inhibits the earning capacity of the affected portions of the population and the country, stunts job creation and affects food security.Eighth, the additional mistake was made of interfering with the private sector, influenced by an incorrect analysis of the national interest. Was the private sector causing the national economy to haemorrhage by repatriating dividends, or was it creating an infusion of fresh money and knowledge and expanding the size of the economy? Fortunately, that mistake has been corrected in Uganda and in much of Africa.Those are the bottlenecks that directly affected the rate of socioeconomic transformation. I do not wish to go into the political bottlenecks here. over the past 20 years, we could have achieved much higher rates of growth, especially if we had had reliable funding for infrastructure, Now that we have a little bit of our own money, we are able to implement infrastructure projects much faster. Even without oil and gas, we were able to move much faster in terms of infrastructure development by relying on ourselves. Of course, additional external funding, if it is focused, sizeable and on time, can be very useful. Without a doubt, Uganda and much of Africa are moving forward robustly. With the resources from the oil and gas we discovered a few years ago, we will be able to fund all our infrastructure needs. The future is bright and our forward movement is irreversible."}}
