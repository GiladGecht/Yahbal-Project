{"speech":{"0":" First of all, on behalf of Ukraine, I sincerely congratulate Mr. John William Ashe on his election to serve as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I wish him success and fruitful work as he discharges this important role.The theme of the present session, “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”, is undoubtedly important for every Member State. The deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals is fast approaching, and the task of producing the ambitious post-2015 action plan is becoming ever more urgent for the international community. I am glad that practical work on implementing that task has already been launched. Its current intensity is confirmed by two important events: the General Assembly special event to follow up efforts made towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals and the inaugural meeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.I am convinced that the actions planned by the President of the General Assembly will allow for substantial acceleration during the sixty-eighth session of the work on elaboration of development goals for the upcoming period. We consider the innovative national consultations mechanisms, which are being successfully applied in the case of Ukraine, an important element of this work. Ukraine stands ready to be engaged fully and with maximum efficiency in these developments, which are extremely important for the international community.The topic of sustainable energy as an item of the post-2015 agenda is of particular significance to us. A new, inclusive approach to that issue must ensure the comprehensive consideration of security, social and environmental aspects. Only such an approach will facilitate sustainable development of energy, especially as regards the efficiency and safety of the nuclear sector. That objective would be favoured by the further development of and joint action on the implementation of the outcomes of Kyiv Summit on the Safe and Innovative Use of Nuclear Energy, which was held in April 2011. I believe that it is within our power to make the world safer. The ideals of peace and the peaceful coexistence of nations are not hollow words for Ukraine but a clear guideline that has informed all of our actions on the international stage since we became independent. That imperative is at the heart of every step and initiative taken by our country in the world arena. The fact that this year Ukraine holds the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) — the largest international regional forum — is a vivid example of that commitment. It is an honour for us, and we view our responsible mission primarily as a mechanism for the consolidation of security and stability in Europe. The Ukrainian chairmanship focuses in particular on the settlement of protracted conflicts and the resumption of control over conventional weapons within the OSCE area, the combat against trafficking in human beings and other very pressing issues on the Organizations agenda. I wish to underline that in every sector I have mentioned, some limited but practically meaningful progress has been achieved.Ukraine has also been able to give added urgency to the issues of energy security and environmental safety issues for the OSCE and take the issue of energy efficiency to a new level. I am confident that the successful realization of the priorities of the Ukrainian chairmanship will allow for the intensifying of cooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE.The year 2014 will mark the twentieth anniversary of Ukraines accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a non-nuclear-weapon State. By ridding the world of its third-largest nuclear arsenal, our country made an unprecedented contribution to global nuclear disarmament. It was at that time that Ukraine, the Russian Federation, Great Britain and the United States concluded the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, joined later by France and China.In view of the historical significance of those events and considering the recent alarming trends in nuclear proliferation, Ukraine will initiate the holding, at the current session of the General Assembly, of a thematic conference. We expect that guarantor States, countries that followed Ukraines example and other interested parties will participate. I hope that this international event will be a good opportunity to come back to the issue of negative security assurances and give it thorough consideration.our world has become less safe than it was five years ago.One of the most painful security problems of today is the civil conflict in Syria, which, unfortunately, is increasingly crossing borders and becoming the source of threats on a regional scale. There is no justification for bloodshed and suffering of the civilian population, including women and children, more than 1.5 million refugees and internally displaced persons, and tens of thousands of foreign citizens who have found themselves in danger. We must do everything in our power to allay the pain and to contain and heal the open wound of his conflict as soon as possible.In our joint actions to settle the conflict, we have to rely on humanistic values, sobriety, competence and mutual responsibility. Ukraine has extended its helping hand to the Syrian population by rendering assistance through United Nations mechanisms. Today, we urge the entire international community to take part in that humanitarian mission.We welcome the plan produced by Russia and the United States to place the Syrian stockpiles of chemical weapons under the control of the international community for their subsequent destruction. At the same time, Ukraine is convinced that the successful implementation of that plan would give hope for that conflict to be brought under control and leave space for a political and diplomatic settlement. It is time to promote the establishment of as wide a platform as possible so as to reach, through multilateral negotiations, a political solution that will make it possible to restore peace and stability in Syria.With respect to pressing problems in the context of contemporary international security, I would like to draw attention to the issue of cybersecurity, which is becoming increasingly important given the development of the information society. Ukraine attaches great significance to that issue as well as to the development of up-to-date mechanisms to combat cybercrimes.We believe that we should focus on strengthening control over the use of the Internet and cyberspace for criminal purposes and for other dangerous, primarily military ends. I am convinced that this process should be led by the United Nations. The United Nations is the best instrument for transforming the Internet into a space of freedom that works in the interests and to the benefit of all nations throughout the world. progress in the modernization of the Security Council. We have great concern about the present stagnancy of the process.I would like to confirm once again the readiness of Ukraine to discuss all progressive concepts related to Security Council reform that could accelerate the implementation of the long-overdue changes. We consider that such reform must take into account the legitimate interests of all regional groups, including the Eastern European group. The countries of our region should be allocated one additional non-permanent seat in an enlarged Security Council.All preconditions have been met for the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly to go down in history as one of the most fruitful in terms of the work of the United Nations, a key political body that is the most representative of all world organizations. I am firmly convinced that the community of nations is up to the task. "}}
