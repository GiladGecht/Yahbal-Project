{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, on behalf of the people and the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Mr. Nicolas Maduro Moros, I would like to convey to General Assembly President John Ashe our congratulations on his recent election to lead this organ of the United Nations. As is known, President Maduro Moros is not here at this session of the General Assembly because of a whole range of delays, obstacles, conditions imposed and lack of guarantees for him and members of his delegation, imposed by the Government of the United States in f lagrant violation of the obligations incumbent upon it under the Headquarters Agreement. Despite The situations in both Syria and the Middle East and between Israel and the Palestinians have been the subject of important mediation efforts. I call for stronger political will and determination to resolve those conflicts. The parties must work harder and the Security Council, especially its permanent members, must shoulder their responsibility. While those efforts have yet to meet with success, I believe that we also have ample evidence to show that mediation works. Measures under Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations deserve more attention, although sometimes action under Chapter VII is also needed. Finland and Turkey continue to co-Chair the Group of Friends of Mediation and to work to strengthen preventive diplomacy, including mediation in the United Nations.Mediation can succeed only with political will from the parties and the international community. Successful mediation also calls for the full and equal participation of women at all stages. Women are certainly most often the victims of conflicts, but we should also understand that they are essential participants for any mediation efforts to bear long-lasting success.Efforts to promote peace and security in the Middle East should go in parallel with the pursuit of the long-time goal of the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction in that region. I encourage all regional parties to continue to engage constructively with the facilitator and the four conveners, as well as with one another, to pave the way for a conference on the establishment of such a zone.All our failures and disappointments notwithstanding, there has also been one true success story for the United Nations this year. I am referring to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), which was adopted in April after decades of effort. It was a success not only for the United Nations system but for the whole international community and the arms control regime. The importance of the Treaty has been confirmed by the growing number of signatories after 3 June, when the ATT was opened for signature. We hope and expect that the signing of the ATT by the United States will be followed by the signing of all other permanent members of the Security Council as well. I should also like to congratulate those countries that have already ratified the Treaty, thereby paving the way for its early entry into force. My own country, Finland, is well on its way to ratifying the ATT as soon as possible. In the meantime, countries such as Venezuela have chosen the path to consolidate real democracy with a socialist system, including the people, and that has enabled us to reach the Millennium Development Goals. Yet we are constantly attacked and demonized and our political and social stability is being disrupted. That is what is happening at this very moment with the anti-democratic opposition in our country, which is being supported by media corporations in the region and from the whole world.Paragraph 4, Article 2, of the Charter of the United Nations emphatically states that “All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”. Yet the President of the United States — and there is the additional irritant that he is a Nobel Peace Prize laureate — is threatening to bomb this or that country if it does not comply with his countrys unilateral demands, which can even include removing a Government that the United States Government does not like. Perhaps that could explain why, despite the fact that the Charter talks about the equality of large and small nations, the President of the United States said just a couple of days ago that the United States was “exceptional”. Does that mean that they are not equal with the other 192 States Member States represented here?The gap today between the noble ideals of the Charter and what is happening by act or omission here in the Organization is truly alarming. Why does nobody in the General Assembly venture to propose that sanctions be imposed for open violations of the Charter on the Government that has an illegal detention centre in the military base at Guantanamo, in occupied Cuban territory, where torture and cruel and degrading and inhuman treatment is being meted out to persons? Why does nobody discuss sanctions against the President who has admitted to illegal espionage activities against Heads of State and Government represented here? That was a point courageously made by the President of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff (see ).Why do we not consider the use of unpiloted planes — so-called drones — which have taken the lives of tens of thousands of innocent victims, including that, we have come here on behalf of the people of the liberator, Simon Bolivar, to speak the truth and to ask some questions, firmly but respectfully, as we learned from our leader, Hugo Chavez Frias, who passed away in March. In that regard, on behalf of my people, I should like to express our gratitude for the heartfelt tribute paid to President Chavez Frias last March (see ).How happy we would be to be here if we were really in a place where we realized the noble ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The Charter talks about saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war, but the truth is that various military interventions have been decided upon or have been allowed here that have engulfed countries and whole regions of the world in long wars and instability. The Security Council has been taken hostage by the hawks of war, and when they can, they justify their attacks from there; when they cannot, they simply bang on the table and still do whatever they want, which is what they are doing when they declare that there will be future bombings in the Syrian Arab Republic.The Charter also states that the purpose of the Organization is to preserve international peace and security. But let me ask: How do some members of the Security Council think we can achieve that purpose by arming and protecting terrorist groups such as Jabhat Al-Nusra and Al-Qaida, which are obscurantist forces? Many of those groups are linked to horrible acts such as the destruction of the Twin Towers in this very city. They deny the existence of anybody who thinks differently from them — whether they be Christians, Muslims or Jews — and profess special hatred and rejection of women. Why are such groups supported? Why do some members of the Security Council sponsor such terrorist groups, window-dressing them as political opposition and even allowing them to give press conferences at this venue? What would representatives of Governments with ongoing internal armed conflicts say if the violent groups they faced were to be given space and a voice here at Headquarters to justify their downfall?The Preamble of the Charter also sets out another noble goal: to promote social progress and raise the standard of living in a broader concept of freedom. In reality, however, poverty, hunger and injustice are continuing to grow and the standard of living and the standard of freedoms are falling lower and lower. That is because what is imposed on us is a model of excluding others — a neo-fascist model — a neo-liberal model. the most complex and sophisticated spying system that humankind has ever been able to come up with.Thanks to those revelations this year, we have woken up to discover that George Orwells 1984 is now here. And what is the United Nations doing about that? Who is setting limits on so much arbitrariness and running roughshod? Those are yet more questions that find no answers from the General Assembly or the Security Council of the Organization, which is now almost 68 years old.We would like to suggest that the Secretary-General set up a body within the United Nations to ensure for every inhabitant in the world the right to privacy and the right to communicate without interception. Much has been said here calling for peace, but that has often fallen on deaf ears. Let us hope that we will all learn how important it is to listen to the calls of the people for peace, and employ that in tirelessly seeking to elevate human dignity as our guiding star.President John Kennedy spoke from this rostrum 50 years ago, the last time he would do so at the United Nations before being assassinated. How good it would be if his current successor, and many people here, were to re-read just some of what he said. Whatever differences we may have had with that historic figure, ensuring peace requires that we seek out areas of agreement such as this:“For the value of this bodys work is not dependent on the existence of emergencies — nor can the winning of peace consist only of dramatic victories. Peace is a daily, a weekly, a monthly process, gradually changing opinions, slowly eroding old barriers, quietly building new structures. And, however undramatic the pursuit of peace, that pursuit must go on.” (09, p. 5)Let us hope that the leaders of the United States and those that follow them blindly will think deeply about the meaning of what Kennedy said and realize that if they really want to be exceptional, they have to find exceptional ways of bringing about lasting peace in the world.In Latin America and the Caribbean we are showing that with exceptional decisions and actions we can build a world of peace. Unity in diversity is what we have in our regional organizations: the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, children and old people, in North Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia to be crimes against humanity? Why do we not impose sanctions against a Government that for more than 50 years has maintained an illegal and criminal economic blockade against the worthy Cuban people, and f louted decisions adopted by overwhelming majorities in the Assembly in favour of ending the embargo?Why do we not implement the resolutions adopted by the plenary so that the State of Palestine can be established as a peaceful, just and lasting solution to the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict? Why does the United Kingdom not agree to start negotiations with Argentina to resolve in a peaceful way demands over the Malvinas Islands? Might it perchance be because the elite of the United States and some of its allies are exceptional?We raise those questions for consideration when it comes to the future of humankind, on behalf of the people of Simon Bolivar — the people of Venezuela — who love peace, equality and freedom. Venezuela has come before the General Assembly today to condemn a kidnapping. The Organization has been kidnapped. The peace and dignity of the world are being held hostage in New York. The kidnapper has many faces. It changes names and sometimes even f lags, but it continues to be the same old imperalism. Eight years ago, Commander Hugo Chavez Frias — a tireless defender of genuine peace, not the peace imposed by bombs, and of participatory democracy and a leader for unity among peoples — called here for a genuine transformation of the United Nations. Seven years ago, he said that there was a whiff of sulphur here (see ). Today, alas, I have to say once again that there is still a whiff of sulphur coming from those who consider themselves exceptional.Those words are truer now than ever before. The courageous revelations of one young man offered a great service to humankind — let us call it a wake-up call. As a result, he is now being persecuted politically and cannot walk freely in the streets of Manhattan. We hope that Edward Snowden will one day be able to walk freely among a future generation of Americans who have taken back their civil rights and helped to ensure peace in the world. That young man has shown us how the privacy of every human being has been violated by I shall now call on those representatives who wish to speak in exercise of the right of reply. May I remind members that statements in exercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and five minutes for the second, and should be made by delegations from their seats.Mr. Ri Tong Il (Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea): We all heard the reference to the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea made this morning by the representative of South Korea (see ). On behalf of the delegation of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, I should like to totally reject that reference as misleading of the reality prevailing on the Korean peninsula and as a distortion of the truth. I should like to clarify the position of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea.First, South Korea made a reference to the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea — the seriousness of its weapons of mass destruction programme. That is one part of the story of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula; he missed the other part of the story.The Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea and its people have been living with nuclear weapons and bombs over their heads for decades. In 1957, they brought into South Korea the first nuclear weapon, marking the beginning of the presence of nuclear weapons and of the largest nuclear-weapon threat. In the 1970s, it had reached more than 1,000 nuclear weapons coming into South Korea, again by the United States. In 2002, the United States Administration of that time proclaimed the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea to be part of the “axis of evil”, which means it should be eliminated. It was listed as a nuclear pre-emptive strike. That blackmailing and hostile policy of the United States is continuing and increasing. The international community has witnessed the opening of the largest-ever joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea — twice this year alone, in March and August, involving, respectively, 500,000 and 200,000 troops and a massive build-up of whatsoever they have as nuclear weapons and their means of delivery.In that situation, for self-defence, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea has been compelled to defend its sovereignty and prevent nuclear weapons from dropping onto the heads of its people. We have been compelled to have a nuclear deterrent.Secondly, with regard to the reference about a nuclear test this year and what he called a ballistic the Union of South American Nations, the Common Market of the South and Petrocaribe. All those are tools for democratizing our societies that promote socially inclusive economic development and ensure political stability. Despite various internal disputes and conflicts between fraternal countries, we have been able to find mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of conflict. We have demonstrated that without military intervention, drones or economic blockades, we can build and preserve genuine democracy and move forward in combating hunger, poverty and inequality.The Venezuelan nation is proud of being part of a region that is free of weapons of mass destruction. We reaffirm our commitment to encouraging the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and chemical and bacteriological weapons as a way of ensuring that life can continue on planet Earth.In his various statements before the Assembly, Commander Chavez Frias called for improving the means for addressing problems and resolving conflicts in a transparent manner. He also pointed out that, in the face of todays reality, there was a crucial need to consider whether the Headquarters of the United Nations should be here in this country where the Government does not respect the Organization, much less the sovereignty of each and every State Member. The United Nations should be in a place where there is respect for all Members; where the political will f lourishes, without pressure or fear, to end conflict in the world through dialogue; where the path forward is genuine social development and the elimination of hunger and poverty; and where what matters is how to stop war, not how to justify it.Let us take the United Nations to the South, where the antithesis to exclusion — solidarity — has often taught us that we are in fact all equal. For now, we welcome the proposal of President Evo Morales Ayma that we should meet in the Organizations various other headquarters in different parts of the world. Beyond the shadows that seem to darken the future of the human race, from Latin America and the Caribbean we are saying and showing that another world is possible where all of us can, in peace and dignity and with justice, enjoy lives worth living."}}
