{"speech":{"0":" It is a distinct honour for me to address this forum. I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. John Ashe on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I am certain that under his leadership, the Assembly will successfully define the post-2015 development agenda at this session. I would also like to express my deepest respect to the Secretary-General for his significant contributions to the continuing work of the United Nations.Over the past 100 years, the miraculous advances of science and technology have changed our world profoundly, making it appear smaller. Peoples lives ill and without basic medicines, and they face a grim future due to the lack of educational opportunities.At the same time, deforestation, exhaustive exploitation of natural resources, pollution and other factors have led to global warming, rising sea levels, unpredictable weather, natural disasters and new epidemics. Those grave dangers are driving poorer nations into deeper destitution.We must rally together to escape poverty, fight disease, protect the environment, respond to natural disasters and build a greener and more just world. Poor countries and peoples need to lift themselves out of poverty with the help of wealthier people and more developed countries. That help must arise not only from a sense of philanthropy — as we say in Viet Nam, whole leaves wrap torn ones — but above all from a sense of responsibility and understanding of our joint destiny. After all, poorer people and nations have contributed to the wealth of richer nations and people, and they deserve a more prosperous future.I urge the global community to craft, with a sense of responsibility and humanity, an ambitious post-2015 development agenda and to redouble our efforts to promote peace, to end hunger and poverty and to protect our planet. Together we can develop a road map of actions for poorer nations to effectively participate in international agreements and institutions and to face and overcome global challenges and dangers in the spirit of the motto adopted by Alexandre Dumass musketeers — “One for all and all for one”.As a Vietnamese, what I have shared with the Assembly comes from experiences soaked in sweat and blood. Just a few decades ago, the very name “Viet Nam” was synonymous with war, division, blood and tears. A remote country called Viet Nam suffered 15 million tons of bombs — four times the amount used in the Second World War. Each Vietnamese bore nearly 10 times his or her weight in bombs, not to mention our populations suffering from over 70 million litres of the silent but deadly Agent Orangdioxin compound.According to a traditional Vietnamese expression, benevolence triumphs over brutality and virtue drives out tyranny. With courageous sacrifice and creativity and with the support of peace-loving people, nations and international organizations, Viet Nam has defended its independence, united and rebuilt from the ashes of war, and left the past behind to become an active and responsible member of the international community.“All men are created equal. They are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness”. All human life is precious, irrespective of race, religion or gender. Taking a single life causes heart-breaking pain to any family, be it here in Manhattan or far away in a remote corner of the Earth. Therefore, any effort to prevent conflict must be valued and supported. Any effort to preserve peace must be fully exhausted. Any act to provoke war must be condemned and stopped. A physician must do whatever is possible to cure a patient if there is but a glimpse of life left. And we must devote all of our efforts to preserving peace if there is but a feeble sign that war can be averted, for war will take the life of not only one, but many people, including many women and children.Peace can be built and preserved only when all countries respect each others independence, sovereignty and cultural traditions, without imposing ones own morality on another. Conflict and war can be averted only if we eliminate actions that run counter to the Charter of the United Nations and international law, dominance and power politics. Strategic trust among nations must be constantly nurtured with honesty, sincerity and concrete actions. In the lifting of the embargo against Cuba or the recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, for example, the role of the United Nations and the Security Council should be promoted. The international community expects the major Powers to set an example for others in peacebuilding. The Security Council should be the fulcrum in building consensus for driving all nations to join hands in preserving peace. The deadly hand of war, conflict, terrorism and violence lies in wait to take the lives of hundreds, thousands or even millions of innocent people. Let us not offer war a hand or look away. Let us stop it.I share the Secretary-Generals view that the Millennium Development Goals are our most successful endeavour against hunger and poverty to date, but let us not forget that close to 40 per cent of global wealth rests in the hands of no more than 1 per cent of the worlds population. The gap between rich and poor continues to widen. Over 1 billion people still live in extreme poverty. Hundreds of millions of people, especially children, continue to be hungry and food insecure, "}}
