{"speech":{"0":" The Republic of Vanuatu is honoured to participate in this debate under your presidency, Sir, and we wish to associate ourselves with all other delegations in congratulating you and the members of your Bureau on your election to lead us through this sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly.On Syria, we have seen internal conflicts transformed into international disputes that require solutions from this body. During this session, there has been intensive debate on the protracted conflict affecting the Syrian people and undermining regional and international peace. We join many other peace-loving nations to call for an end to the conflict and for the United Nations to do more strongly to enforce the international ban on the use of chemical weapons. We also urge the United States of America and the Russian Federation to take a strong leading role in the issue of Syria and in addressing the chemical-weapons issue there.We are concerned at the fact that that such conflicts have often diverted the international focus from addressing much more important issues, such as our common aspirations for the Millennium Development Goals. It is unfair that countries resorting to such illegitimate acts can trigger wars that cost a great deal of money, whereas the rest of the peace-loving countries and their peoples suffer the consequences, as the monies spent could be diverted to better and effective use.It is here, from this rostrum, that the leaders of our nations have spoken out freely, from their hearts, in an endeavour to find common solutions so as to inspire the community of nations committed to international peace and security. Our main objectives are to take collective decisions so as to address a spectrum of international issues, some of which require urgent action, such as the issue of climate change. It is here that we have called for the recognition of the rights of women, children and persons with disabilities who are caught up in conflicts and violence. It is here that we have called for help for those who have been discriminated against because of their colour, their religion or their political convictions.For the Republic of Vanuatu, this rostrum is the only international platform from which, year after year since 1981, we have spoken out against colonialism and neo-imperialism in all its forms. Today once again, I speak on behalf of the entire population of our It is time for the United Nations to move beyond its limits and take action to rectify the errors of the past. Since our independence 33 years ago, the indigenous peoples of my country have remained concerned that a part of our maritime and cultural jurisdiction, including the islands of Umaepnune and Leka, situated south of Vanuatu, are still occupied by France. Thus, the people of our country are denied the right to the exercise of full political freedom and their inherent cultural rights. The indigenous peoples of the southern province of our country cannot, therefore, fulfil their obligations to protect their culture and traditions that bind them to the sovereign land that has been theirs since time immemorial.Those two islands are of paramount importance, because they form the basis for the establishment of our unique cultural framework, which brings together our cultural island group known as the Tafea Islands. It is that cultural framework that governed us and defined our identity and our way of life long before administrative colonial Powers began to explore and govern our shores. Unfortunately, today, our indigenous peoples continue to be denied access to those sacred and cultural islands. My Government therefore calls on the community of nations meeting in the Assembly to uphold the principles of the respect of the rights of our indigenous peoples and their way of life. Further, we call upon the French Government to allow our indigenous people of Tafea to have access to the land of their forefathers, the islands Umaenupne and Leka in the south of the Republic of Vanuatu. The call by the United Nations to review the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to strategize a post-2015 development agenda compels us to rethink our global partnership structures and our national priorities in order to better achieve our goals in the period after 2015. My country has made some progress in achieving some of the MDG targets. However, the appropriate conditions for economic growth and development must be created. An integrated and balanced approach is required to deal adequately with the social, economic and environmental dimensions. To that end, my Government has placed emphasis on climate change, renewable energy and the sustainable use of the environment. We have now created a separate Ministry focusing on adaptation to climate change, everything possible to ensure that human rights are respected in West Papua, saying “whether you are an independent State or a non-self-governing territory or whatever, [that] human right is inalienable and a fundamental principle of the United Nations”. Now, as Members of the United Nations, we must call for those words to be translated into action. My Government calls upon the United Nations to appoint a special representative to investigate alleged human rights violations in West Papua and its political status in the light of the controversies surrounding the administration established in the 1960s, the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority. Ever since the controversial Act of Free Choice, the West Papuans have always been consistently denied any sort of recognition by the United Nations. It is clear from many historical records that the Melanesian people of West Papua were the scapegoats of Cold War politics and were sacrificed to gratify the appetite for the natural resources that the country possesses. Today, they are still victims of the ignorance of the United Nations.If the United Nations representative at the time, Mr. Fernando Ortiz-Sanz, described the West Papuan issue as a cancer growing on the side of the United Nations and that it was his job to remove it, it is very clear today from what we have observed that that cancer has never been removed, but merely concealed. One day it will have to be treated. We must not be afraid. The United Nations has made mistakes in the past. We must admit our mistakes and see that we are the stronger for that, because when we are weak, admit our mistakes and take corrective action, we become stronger and more alive. As Members of the United Nations, we all subscribe to the principles of democracy, good governance, human rights, accountability and the rule of law enshrined in the United Nations Charter. In this age of technology, when nothing can escape the attention of civil society and Governments, I ask how then can we ignore the hundreds of thousands of West Papuans who have been brutally beaten and murdered?The people of West Papua are looking to the United Nations as a beacon of hope. We are now deliberating on the issue of Syria. In that same spirit, I would ask that my fellow leaders express support for West Papua. All our development initiatives must be inclusive and not ignore the poor and the marginalized. My country has taken the measures necessary to ensure gender equality and the empowerment of women. The Governments measures include legislation amending laws on sexual discrimination, addressing issues of domestic violence and the submission of universal periodic reports to ensure compliance with the reporting framework of the Human Rights Council. In conclusion, I wish to thank you once again, Mr. President, for giving me the opportunity to express my views in this forum. We have spoken a great deal about many things, and we now must translate our words into action. Long live our aspirations for a better and more secure world for everyone!"}}
