{"speech":{"0":" I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I also wish also to thank you for your continued strong support for small island developing States (SIDS) issues, which you have championed for many years and have once again demonstrated, this week, in the process and lead-up to the United Nations Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States, to be held in the Pacific next year.From economic woes to outright poverty, from social instability to acts of violence and ethnic or religious conflict, and from the devastation of natural disasters to deadly acts of terrorism, no country is spared or completely shielded. The events in Kenya, Iraq, Pakistan and here in the United States over the past week demonstrate the multiple risks we face in todays world. Our sympathies go to the Governments and people of those countries, and our deepest condolences to the people who lost family and friends in those tragic events.While the Organization continues to grapple with various serious problems that require collective, United Nations-led action for their resolution, perhaps the greatest threat we face today is climate change. Climate change is a security risk of far greater proportions than small arms and light weapons worldwide, particularly into the Caribbean region, where the tide of guns is often accompanied by torrents of narcotics as they make their way to markets in other countries.I am deeply disappointed at the international communitys endless, rudderless and seemingly vacuous negotiations on climate change. Our failure to achieve meaningful progress on this matter of existential urgency is inexcusable. Vulnerable countries like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are on the front line of climate change and are already bearing the brunt of the increasing fallout of global warming. Meanwhile, the major emitters and historical polluters pay callously insincere lip service to our plight. For them, combating climate change is a question of dollars and cents, not life and death. They are only too happy to see the multilateral process fail, so that they can retreat into ineffectual and painless national commitments. But those stubborn obstacles to progress must no longer be allowed to stand in the way of the survival and development of vast swaths of our planet.I applaud the initiative of the Secretary-General to convene a high-level event on climate change in the hope that such a meeting will give our meandering negotiations impetus and direction. The post-2015 development agenda will not survive global warming if it goes unchecked. It is also high time for genuine negotiations in good faith and for meaningful resources to assist in mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change.In conclusion, I would like to recall that the Charter of the United Nations begins with the phrase “We the peoples of the United Nations.” It is not “We the rich peoples”, nor “We the militarily powerful peoples” nor “We the peoples of large countries”; but “We the peoples” — of the entire world, the whole membership of this institution. The United Nations does not exist to confer benefits to select groups, but to secure peace and development for all. If we are to set the stage for the future of development, that stage must be inclusive so that all nations and peoples have a significant part to play and a stake in the outcomes. Let us make ourselves worthy successors of the ennobling, humanizing vision of our venerated founding fathers and mothers. I shall be saying this ages and ages hence: two roads diverge in the woods, and I have chosen the one less travelled by, and that has made all the difference. hands to cause instability. Indeed, within our own Pacific region, such so-called small arms have fuelled conflicts, disrupted the lives of communities and impeded countries development. The Arms Trade Treaty, when fully implemented, will greatly help small island States like mine in their efforts to sustain our communities security and stability. Our signing of the ATT is also further testimony to our firm commitment to general and complete disarmament, since it will contribute significantly to saving lives, stopping human rights abuses and avoiding crises, and is an important step in reducing and eventually eliminating altogether the human cost of conventional arms.Samoa remains fully committed to the peacekeeping work of the United Nations, one of the Organizations most effective and successful mandates. For more than 10 years, Samoa has been contributing civilian police officers to peacekeeping operations in countries such as South Sudan, Timor-Leste, Liberia, the Sudan and, in the Pacific, the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. We will be in a better position to increase our contribution to peacekeeping missions after a United Nations selection, assistance and assessment team has completed its evaluation, which is planned to take place before the end of 2013, of eligible officers from our police force.Samoa looks forward to next weeks High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development. International migration poses both challenges and opportunities for countries of origin, transit and destination. Its contribution to sustainable development will therefore ultimately depend upon the willingness of source and destination countries to work out imaginative and humane arrangements that benefit both those countries and migrants. Samoa is working closely with New Zealand and Australia, through their seasonal-worker schemes, to ensure that those important initiatives result in mutual benefit for both the sending and receiving parties in the arrangements.Yesterdays High-level Meeting on Nuclear Disarmament () highlighted yet again the urgent need for a treaty banning nuclear weapons, given the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of such weapons. Such weapons represent the great paradox of our time. While nations desire peace and talk of peace, far more of the national wealth goes towards the development and acquisition of ever more sophisticated and destructive weapons of mass destruction. Our Pacific region was the scene of a great many people are prepared to admit. For some low-lying Pacific island countries, climate change may well lead to their eventual extinction as sovereign States. The singular importance and urgency of climate change to our region was given added prominence today when Pacific Forum leaders met with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Our Chair, the President of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, presented to the Secretary-General the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership, which is an effort by our region — the most likely to be first and worst affected by climate change — to launch a new wave of more determined leadership across the globe, aimed at accelerating the reduction and phasing down of the worlds greenhouse-gas pollution before it is too late.Mr. Toure (Guinea), Vice-President, took the Chair.The root causes of climate change and the means for addressing them are widely known. We in the Pacific know already from bitter and harsh experience, as will many other parts of the world, what the consequences of climate change are, and they will only become more severe if not enough is done. Sadly, what is evident to us in the climate change negotiations is the continued triumph of vested interests in preventing and delaying the action that should be taken. In a diverse world of different capacities and capabilities, those least able to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change look to Member States in leadership roles to rise to the challenge and lead by example, to ensure that the post-2020 climate change convention currently being negotiated will effectively address the mounting fears of countries like mine of the catastrophic effects of climate change if it is not tackled collectively and with determination. As world leaders, we have the responsibility for fashioning a new agreement that will reassure low-lying islands that we have their interests and priorities at heart. Let us rise to the occasion and be part of the solution.In June, during the historic event of the signing of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), Samoa announced that it would sign the Treaty at the highest political level during the Treaty event at the General Assemblys current session. We kept that promise, and I signed for Samoa in a special ceremony two days ago. We welcome the fact that more than 100 nations, including the United States, have now signed the Treaty. For small island countries like Samoa, it takes only a few small arms and light weapons in the wrong destruction and, now, their use in Syria is unnerving. The untold suffering brought about by the Syrian crisis has touched many hearts, and the latest episode, where we watched in utter disbelief the use of chemical weapons to kill indiscriminately defenceless victims and even children, is incomprehensible.We therefore welcome the joint proposal by the United States and Russia and the willingness of Syria to have its chemical weapons destroyed under the competent United Nations authority. We expect total compliance, which is required for this initiative to succeed. As long as weapons of mass destruction such as chemical weapons continue to exist, some megalomaniac will sooner or later resort to their use, with deadly consequences for the world. The ultimate safeguard is, of course, the destruction of all such weapons, whether chemical, biological or nuclear.The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development called for the convening in 2014 of a Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States, to remind the international community that small island developing States (SIDS) face unique challenges and vulnerabilities requiring dedicated support and to help build their resilience.Samoa is honoured to host that Conference in September 2014, on behalf of the Pacific small island developing countries. The Barbados interregional meeting endorsed “The sustainable development of small island developing States through genuine and durable partnerships” as the overarching theme of the Conference. A renewed global partnership will help SIDS to manage a multitude of risks, so that they can pursue inclusive economic growth, social development and environmental sustainability.Samoa has also proposed to utilize the Conference as a platform to launch specific, concrete SIDS partnerships as the most effective means to implement some of the groups challenges and as a legacy of the Conference.In advancing the SIDS development agenda, the Samoa Conference strategically provides a window for SIDS as a group to agree on their priorities and to consolidate their positions ahead of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moons leaders summit on climate change in 2014, the post-2015 United Nations development agenda now under discussion, and the negotiations for a successor climate-change treaty post-2020, which are in progress.deal of nuclear testing, with some islands still bearing the scars of those tests. Our regional response was the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, the Rarotonga Treaty, to ensure that nuclear testing in the Pacific would be a thing of the past.Samoa reaffirms its continued support for a nuclear-test-free world. Early agreement must be reached to ban nuclear testing and to cease the creation and manufacture of more nuclear weapons.We place great faith in the rule of law and the vital protection it offers to all States, especially to weak and small countries such as mine, with no armed force and not affiliated with any military grouping. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is an important part of the architecture of world peace based on the rule of law, and we are pleased to have been the second State party to ratify the two Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute last year. With the deposit yesterday of the ninth instrument of ratification, we hope that the Kampala amendments will come into force soon and that the ICC will become the first court since the international military tribunals in Nuremburg and Tokyo to hold individuals responsible for crimes of aggression.The United Nations needs to adapt to the changing contemporary international environment or risk being bypassed in favour of institutions and groupings that are more responsive to the needs of Member States. The High-level Political Forum is one such welcome reform, and Samoa is very pleased to have participated in its inaugural meeting this week.Still more fundamental reform is required to address the existing imbalances in the current power structure of the Security Council through the enlargement of both categories of membership and improvements to its working methods, so as to reflect the realities of the present time and to enhance the Councils role and effectiveness.The renewed efforts made and great courage shown in the process of restarting the stalled Middle East peace plan for the Israeli and Palestinian peoples has our strongest endorsement. It gives rise to hope that the two-State solution, which is the only option with realistic prospects for lasting peace, can still be achieved.The number of areas of tension and trouble spots around the globe is increasing, and they are getting deadlier. The availability of weapons of mass of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and his visionary call, in his first appearance before the General Assembly, in 1974, for a world order based on peace and justice and a global economic arrangement to free the world of poverty, hunger and aggression. As his daughter, I am proud to have been among leaders who adopted the Millennium Declaration in 2000, to have been at the review of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2010 and to be participating now in the transition from the MDGs to the post-2015 development agenda.I hope that this years theme — “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” — will help us to design a pragmatic strategy for those goals. The Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals and the newly established High-level Political Forum are making good progress. Our experience also will be useful in overcoming the challenges to the MDGs by 2015 and in preparing the post-2015 development agenda.Bangladesh has submitted to the United Nations a draft of the post-2015 development agenda that covers socioeconomic and environmental goals and the resources required for achieving them. We also held a Global Leadership Meeting on Population Dynamics in Dhaka, whose declaration placed human individuals at the centre of the entire development agenda. The declaration incorporated population growth, ageing, urbanization and migration as the priority issues. The meeting also strongly identified the need for mainstreaming migration in the post-2015 development agenda, particularly to accommodate the expected climate migrants.Our aim is to become a middle-income country and to realize our Vision 2021 by setting goals that are in line with the MDGs. We have already met or are on track to meet Millennium Development Goals 1 through 6. Poverty has been reduced from 56.6 per cent in 1991 to below 26 per cent today. In the past four and a half years, the average gross domestic product growth rate remained at 6.4 per cent; 50 million people have joined the middle income group; export earnings rose from $10.53 billion in 2006 to $27.03 billion today; remittances increased from $5 billion in 2006 to $14.5 billion; foreign currency reserves improved from $3.49 billion in 2006 to $16 billion; and power production capacity also increased from 3,200 megawatts in 2006 to 9,059 megawatts today, to name a few indicators.Let me conclude by conveying our gratitude to all our partners — developed and developing, big and small, Governments and non-governmental organizations, civil society and the private sector — for their dedicated support, which has helped my country to reach a new threshold in its journey as a State Member of the United Nations. Our new status as a non-least developed country beyond January 2014 can be sustained only with the support of Samoas truly genuine and durable partners."}}
