{"speech":{"0":" Allow me, at the outset to extend sincere my congratulations to Ambassador John Ashe, President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. We are confident that he will ably guide the work of the Assembly during this session. I also extend my thanks and gratitude to Mr. Vuk Jeremic, President of the Assembly at the previous session, for his efforts. We wish to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his wise leadership of the Organization and for his interest in the developments taking place in the world and in my country. It is a felicitous coincidence that the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly coincides with the celebrations in my country in honour of the September and October revolutions. Allow me, from this important international rostrum, to congratulate the great and valiant people of Yemen on this important occasion and to commend the country and people of Yemen for their resilience and their sacrifices in emancipating themselves from the yoke of colonization, injustice, oppression and despotism. I also wish to congratulate the people of Yemen for wisely and patiently forging ahead on the path of change and modernization for more than 50 years and for their determination to rid themselves of all the remnants of the past. I commend them on their stewardship of the historic political change, chief among them the implementation of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) initiative, with the support of international and regional communities. From this rostrum, I wish to commend my countrys youth for its leadership throughout the transition process in building institutions, enhancing and promoting freedom and democracy, and building a new Yemen where justice, liberty and good governance prevail. The values of justice, freedom and equality, respect for human rights and the maintenance of international peace and security are the main pillars and principles on which the United Nations was established. Because of our firm belief in those values and principles, we have always sought to implement and promote United promote accountability and transparency in the work of the Council.The rule of law and accountability have made steady progress in the work of the United Nations. Nevertheless, that progress remains abstract for countless individuals who are vulnerable to atrocities. Sexual violence in conflict has become a rampant phenomenon, with women and girls at particular risk of becoming victims. The ICC has made the fight against that scourge a priority. Most important, though, we must do our part as States. Liechtenstein fully supports the United Kingdoms initiative to take greater action to end sexual violence during conflict. The fight against sexual violence must also play a central role in the larger context of the women, peace and security agenda. All of that requires stronger emphasis on the need to empower women. Many of our stated goals, from sustainable development to lasting peace, require the full participation of women. Otherwise, they are simply not attainable. In that regard, I am grateful for the leadership of the Secretary-General. We should all rally behind his call to make the twenty-first century the century for women.The upcoming negotiations on the post-2015 agenda will be a crucial test of our ability to tackle challenges that will define the lives of future generations. We look forward to the leadership of the President of the General Assembly in that process. It is of course too early to offer a final assessment of the Millennium Development Goals. But we know that important unfinished business will be carried over into the sustainable development goals. Those new goals must be much more than just an extension of past efforts. They must aim at eradicating poverty and hunger once and for all, and finally ensure full equality between men and women. They must therefore be firmly rooted in human rights, respect for the rule of law and principles of good governance. The sustainable development goals will ensure sustainability only if they approach development in a holistic way. Most important, once we have agreed on our new goals, we need to become more serious in our commitment to achieving them. Let us therefore develop and apply an effective monitoring mechanism to show the world that we are indeed serious.The post-2015 process will also be decisive in moving the General Assembly back to the centre of multilateral policy-making. Only the “G-193” provides the legitimacy and universality required for decisions Yemen where democracy, the peaceful transfer of power, the promotion of freedom, justice, partnership, equality and equal opportunities for all citizens prevail. Those foundations will enhance the authority of the State, the rule of law, security, stability and the unity of Yemen. We are also forging ahead with strengthening security and stability in our country and restructuring the military and security institutions, so as to bolster their main national task — to be loyal to the State rather than to parties or individuals. We are certain that our brethren and our friends will assist us in our new endeavour, namely, the drafting of the new constitution and the holding of a referendum on it, as well as in our preparations for the next presidential and parliamentary elections. The achievements being made and that will be made, in the ongoing political process depend heavily on the support of the international community and on enhanced partnership and cooperation between the international community and Yemen, especially as there are internal and external parties that continue to attack the will of the Yemeni people. Those parties are making every effort to obstruct the achievement of political settlements and to target all the factors of stability and the foundations of development in my country. Such acts require the appropriate international measures so as to deter and punish all those who are trying to defeat this unique model in the region. There are a multitude of factors at play, particularly the increasing unemployment rate, growing levels of poverty, and poor social services in general. All those factors exacerbate instability and create a fertile environment for the actions of extremist groups such as Al-Qaida. However, eliminating them effectively requires all kinds of logistical, financial and technical support through practical programmes and plans that do address not only the symptoms, but also the root causes of those phenomena. We need the international communitys support in implementing our national counter-terrorism strategy. That is why the fulfilment of pledges by donor countries and the Friends of Yemen must be accelerated, particularly since the Government of Yemen has been working in partnership with donors to earmark and allocate all those funds to various development areas. I wish to take this opportunity to thank all our donors, especially those who have already made good Nations instruments and to support peaceful coexistence among nations. Perhaps the lofty and noble purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and all its instruments served as inspiration in the political settlement and the comprehensive national dialogue that we have been pursuing for more than six months.Those purposes and principles are also reflected in two aspects of the current situation. First is our desire for coexistence and consensus, our rejection of violence and our preference for the language of dialogue and logic and reason. The second aspect is the fact that Yemen is considered a unique model that should be followed, given the tremendous change being witnessed in our region. The acute crisis that befell Yemen in 2011 reflected internal understanding and tolerance and a desire for coordination with regional and international partners. In that context, we wish to reiterate our thanks and appreciation to all those who stood by the people of Yemen and by the political settlement embodied in the Gulf initiative, chief among them the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud; the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the GCC Secretary General, Mr. Abdul Latif bin Rashid Al Zayani. I also extend my thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and to Security Council members for visiting Yemen on two occasions. As my country is a unique model among the countries in which the Arab Spring is unfolding, those visits have enhanced the new approach, which is based on the GCC initiative and Security Council resolutions on Yemen. We thank the five permanent members of the Security Council for their unified vision with regard to Yemen, which made it possible for us to forge ahead with the political process and crown it with success. We also extend our appreciation to the League of Arab States, the European Union, Germany and all the relevant international organizations and institutions, as well as to the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on Yemen, Mr. Jamal Benomar, for his efforts to achieve reconciliation between the parties in Yemen. As the Assembly is aware, my country has made great strides in the implementation of the GCC initiative and its mechanisms. We are now turning to the second phase, that of concluding the work of the comprehensive National Dialogue and forging ahead with our plan to shape our future. The results of this endeavour will lay the foundations for the establishment of a new, modern Palestinian conflict and put a stop to all the occupying Powers oppressive measures and practices and attempts to Judaize the holy city of Jerusalem, expand settlement activities, detain Palestinian citizens and excavate illegally around the Al-Aqsa Mosque.We also wish to denounce the use of chemical weapons, especially in Syria, by any party. We call on all the parties in the Syrian conflict to stop the bloodshed, agree to a dialogue and to work towards a political settlement and reconciliation and reconstruction. We call on the international and regional parties concerned to intensify their efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the crisis. A “Geneva II” conference should be convened as soon as possible in order to put an end to the violence, killings and bloodshed in Syria. Recent events have demonstrated the challenges facing the United Nations in this area, particularly regarding the disagreement between permanent members of the Security Council, which was a pretext for certain groups to opt for unilateral action outside the international legitimacy represented by the United Nations. The Council needs thorough reform for it to be able to carry out its primary task, which is the maintenance of international peace and security and the peaceful settlement of conflicts.Concerning the brotherly country of Somalia and our support for it, we call on the international community to continue to stand by it in order to enable it to overcome its long legacy of conflict and suffering.Finally, I would like to thank the President and the Secretary-General once again"}}
