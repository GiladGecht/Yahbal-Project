{"speech":{"0":" It is an honour and a privilege for me to once again address this body. South Africa attaches the utmost importance to the General Assembly as the most representative and democratic organ of the United Nations serving the international community.of society — civil society, the private sector, the world of business and finance and, above all, young people, all of them agents of change — is the only path of hope for the radical transformation that is needed. There is no alternative to defining a new programme and a new paradigm.At the current rate, if we do not change our behaviour, we will need the equivalent of two planet Earths to meet the needs of the worlds population, which, as we know, will reach 9 billion in 2050 and has always been concentrated in urban and coastal zones, whose natural resources are particularly vulnerable. That simple fact should prompt us to adopt sustainable modes of production and consumption, in accordance with the decisions taken at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. That essential change of mindset presupposes that we place human beings at the heart of the development issue. It is no longer a question of agreeing on development plans for agricultural, artisanal and industrial capacities. We must consider that it is human societies and individuals who deserve all of our attention. We must study economic and environmental issues in the light of their impact on the lives of people and communities. Taking those needs into account means that we must reflect further on how to ensure responsible development that respects the environment and is truly sustainable.The Assembly is aware of my personal commitment to issues involving the oceans and seas. In accordance with the Monaco Message on the acknowledged importance of the oceans in “The future we want” (resolution , annex), which was adopted in November 2011, I am once again committing to promoting the role of the oceans in the definition of the post-2015 agenda and to reiterating my support for a sustainable development goal focusing on the oceans. Climate regulation, food and nutrition security, energy, tourism, transport and international trade — all areas that directly or indirectly affect the oceans — are linked to the three pillars of sustainable development. I think it is also essential to reaffirm how fundamental the oceans are to the world and how serious are the risks presented to them through the excessive human activity that contributes to their acidification and the acceleration of the drop in the resources they contain.In that context, I would like to say how crucial I believe it is that the international community address the status of the high seas without delay, and how urgent it is that protected marine areas be established, especially become huge non-tariff barriers. They include the green economy and clean technology. While those issues are important for Africa and developing countries and need to be attended to, the manner in which they have been crafted restrains economic development, as they are used as obstacles.We also wish to emphasize our expectations that the developed North and developing South will continue to engage in a genuine partnership. In that regard, the developed North countries should stand ready to meet their commitment to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national income to official development assistance.We are aware of the challenges in the North caused by the economic meltdown, but we are of the view that investing in development in the South, especially in Africa, is of primary importance as a source of much-needed sustainable development and stability in the world. Attempts to delegate some of those historical responsibilities to new emerging economies in the South are unacceptable and unworkable, as such emerging nations have their own historical challenges and backlogs to deal with. Furthermore, any commitment we make to the future beyond 2015 must build on existing agreements, which include Agenda 21, the MDGs, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the outcome document of the Rio de Janeiro Conference on Sustainable Development. In the case of Africa, they must build on the New Partnership for Africas Development.Development and security are two sides of the same coin. The best way to ensure both is through good governance and the promotion of democratic values in all societies. Allow me, therefore, to register once again our serious concern that the Security Council, almost 70 years since its establishment, remains undemocratic, unrepresentative and unfair to developing nations and small States, and disenfranchises the majority of the States Members of the United Nations, which form the majority in the General Assembly. We cannot remain beholden indefinitely to the will of an unrepresentative minority on the most important issues of international peace and security.There has been too much talk about the need for reform, with too little action. We would like to challenge the Assembly today by saying “Let us set ourselves the target to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations in 2015 with a reformed, more inclusive, democratic and representative Security Council!”.We congratulate President Ashe and the Republic of Antigua and Barbuda on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. We also thank Mr. Vuk Jeremic for the splendid way in which he presided over the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.Let me begin by reiterating our condemnation of the horrific terrorist attack over the weekend in Kenya, in which a number of civilians, including a South African national, were killed. We express our deepest condolences to the Government and people of Kenya and to all those families who lost loved ones, and wish the wounded survivors a speedy recovery. We continue to support the efforts of Kenya and the international community aimed at peacekeeping, stability, democracy and nation-building in Somalia.The theme for our debate this year, “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”, is most appropriate. In the year 2000, the commitment was made by world leaders in the Millennium Declaration to eradicate extreme poverty and adopt the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs are measurable and achievable targets that were specifically crafted to address the most pressing development needs of the most vulnerable countries. The full implementation of the MDGs remains the key priority on the development agenda for the next two years.A development agenda for beyond 2015 should allow individual regions and States the space to address the development needs peculiar to their circumstances and priorities. For Africa in particular, the future development agenda should address poverty eradication, income inequality and job creation. We furthermore believe that the new development agenda can be effective only if it is focused on all three dimensions of sustainable development, namely, the eradication of poverty through economic development, social development and environmental sustainability.We also wish to emphasize that any development agenda beyond 2015 must be based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities in order to equalize the international playing field. We raise this point out of our concern that the global economic meltdown seems to have brought about new developments that are detrimental to the developing world, especially Africa. Some of the new developments include the tendency to renegotiate the rules of the game. New issues are being introduced as prerequisites for development and partnerships and have, in fact, Nations stood by South Africa, we would like to see the Organization be at the forefront of efforts towards self-determination for the peoples of Palestine and Western Sahara.We are deeply concerned about continued illegal settlement activities in the West Bank in violation of international law. Such illegal settlement activities jeopardize the realization of the two-State solution.The Cuban people also hold a special place in our hearts because of that countrys sacrifice for African peoples in their quest for freedom. We will therefore continue to struggle with them for their economic liberation.At its sixty-eighth session the General Assembly will undertake critical work for the future of our people. Let us tackle the work ahead in such a manner that when future generations look back on this moment, they will be able to say that the leaders of this generation laid the foundation for the eradication of poverty, for building a global society of equality, and for world peace.Let me borrow from the words of our former President Nelson Mandela on his inauguration day in 1994 when he said:“We understand it still that there is no easy road to freedom. We know it well that none of us acting alone can achieve success. We must therefore act together as a united people, for national reconciliation, for nation-building, for the birth of a new world. Let there be justice for all. Let there be peace for all. Let there be work, bread, water and salt for all. Let each know that for each the body, the mind and the soul have been freed to fulfil themselves.”"}}
