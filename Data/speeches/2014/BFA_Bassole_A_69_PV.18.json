{"speech":{"0":" Every year, the General Assembly gives us the opportunity to get together to discuss our concerns in the various parts of the world. Here we are, meeting again to evaluate what has been accomplished and to consider new solutions to the many challenges confronting our shared responsibility. And Burkina Faso is committed, as always, to participating in this important get-together, the symbol of international solidarity. Burkina Faso also reiterates its commendation of the joint visit to the Sahel by the Secretary-General, the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, the President of the World Bank, the President of the African Development Bank and the European Commissioner for Development within the framework of the United Nations integrated strategy for the Sahel, which aims to promote security, good governance, development and human rights as factors of peace and stability. like I would to express our gratitude to President Kutesas predecessor, Ambassador John Ashe, for his positive record during his tenure. I also heartily congratulate the President on his election, and I am confident that his wealth of experience with international and development issues will enable him to effectively guide our work on the post-2015 development agenda, in order to formulate an ambitious new framework for development aimed at bringing our peoples growth, fairness and a better life. Lastly, Burkina Faso welcomes the Assemblys adoption of the Secretary-Generals Ebola initiative (resolution ) and welcomes his appointment of Mr. David Nabarro as Senior United Nations System Coordinator for Ebola Virus Disease and Mr. Anthony Banbury as his Special Representative and Head of the United Nations Mission on Ebola Emergency Response. These steps will certainly help the West African subregion to strengthen its public-health systems in order to eradicate the epidemic, whose spread could permanently compromise the areas social cohesion, development and economic integration.

(E) *1455187* would like to express its sympathy and solidarity with the affected countries, and it reiterates its commitment to participating in the quest for a collective solution that can ensure effective protection for the people and for health personnel, as well as the free movement of people and goods within the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Today we can celebrate the progress made in efforts to achieve and maintain peace, as well as to achieve our development goals, despite the fact that there is still work to be done to speed up improvement of our peoples living conditions. In Burkina Faso, notwithstanding our unfavourable geographical and climatic conditions and a difficult international economic environment, we are committed, with determination and realism, to building development. In the last few decades, therefore, we have established and implemented strategic development programmes and plans designed to put our country firmly on the road to emergence. Poverty reduction, the empowerment of women and full employment for young people are some of our main objectives. For several years consecutively those efforts have enabled Burkina Faso to record average annual growth rates of around 5 per cent and achieve significant investments in a number of areas that include health, education, agriculture, and water, road and energy infrastructures. Clearly, development efforts cannot thrive without a stable, peaceful environment. To that end, our President, Mr. Blaise Compaore, and the Government of Burkina Faso continue to work to entrench a culture of tolerance and peaceful coexistence that seeks to establish, through dialogue and consultations, the essential elements of social cohesion, a strengthened democratic process and respect for individual and collective liberties. As a member of the Human Rights Council, Burkina Faso continues to set a good example by making the promotion and defence of human rights a major focus of its Government policy on improving the peoples welfare. That has been the context for the work of Mrs. Chantal Compaore, a goodwill ambassador for the Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children, whose commitment to dealing with the issue of female genital mutilation is an important contribution to global efforts to protect the rights of women and girls. Burkina Faso welcomes the Human Rights Councils recent adoption of a draft resolution on “Intensifying global efforts and sharing good practices to effectively eliminate female genital mutilation” , submitted by the African Group at Burkina Fasos initiative. We are following with concern the crises and conflicts that unfortunately continue to plague parts of the world, particularly the African continent. However, under the auspices of ECOWAS, we welcome the significant progress made over recent months in restoring peace and democracy in West Africa, especially in Guinea-Bissau and Mali. With respect to Mali, ECOWAS mediation brought about the restoration of constitutional order and the holding of free and fair elections throughout the national territory. For the continuation of the peace process in Mali, Burkina Faso welcomes and supports the efforts of the Peoples Democratic Republic of Algeria in the search for a lasting peace solution in accordance with the Preliminary Agreement signed in Ouagadougou on 18 June 2013. That Agreements ultimate goal is to restore peace, the territorial integrity of Mali and of the ECOWAS region, and cohesion among all Malian communities, in order to achieve the objectives of harmonious development and subregional integration. In Mali, as elsewhere in the Sahel subregion, armed conflicts are becoming more complex and more radicalized because of the emergence of violent extremism and terrorism closely associated with the criminal economy, which is characterized, inter alia, by trafficking in drugs, weapons and human beings. Those evils challenge us in our shared responsibility in the fight to eradicate them. It is more urgent than ever to work together by focusing on preventive measures and addressing their root causes, namely such predisposing factors as extreme poverty, youth unemployment, and the denial of rights and justice. Similarly, it is important to strengthen the rapid- response capabilities of our States and international cooperation in the exchange of information, in order to allow our defence forces and security to fight effectively against terrorist threats. In that regard, Burkina Faso expresses its deep gratitude to all partner countries, especially France and the United States of America, whose contribution to the efforts to secure the Sahel is priceless. We would now like to reiterate our total solidarity with and full support for the people and Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which continue to face the unprecedented rise of terrorism and religious intolerance. Other African countries are also experiencing crisis situations. We are thinking in particular of Somalia, Libya, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Sudan. With respect to the Central African Republic, Burkina Faso salutes the efforts of the international mediator, President Sassou Nguesso, and welcomes the Brazzaville Forum, which concluded with an agreement on the cessation of hostilities. My country supports the Transitional Government, welcomes the effective establishment of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic and reiterates its readiness to contribute to efforts to restore and keep peace in Central Africa. In the light of all these crises, Burkina Faso would emphasize the urgent need to restore and maintain an environment of peace and stability in the countries concerned, without which our development and integration efforts will be in vain. In that context, no effort should be spared to protect peacekeepers who risk their lives working to provide security and comfort to civilians. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate our strong condemnation of intentional attacks against all United Nations troops in theatres of peacekeeping. As it always has, Burkina Faso will continue to participate in the collective action of peacekeeping in countries in difficulty, in particular Darfur, Mali, Guinea-Bissau, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Haiti. We express our deep appreciation to partner countries for their various forms of support in terms of training and equipment, which allow Burkinabe troops to accomplish their tasks efficiently wherever they are sent. With respect to conflict resolution, Burkina Faso advocates dialogue and consultation, which is the basis for Burkina Fasos consistent action when the President of our country is sought after as a mediator or facilitator. Accordingly, I welcome the adoption on 31 July by the Assembly of resolution on “Strengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes, conflict prevention and resolution”. In that regard, my country, a member of the Group of Friends of Mediation, encourages the actions taken under the leadership of Finland and Turkey. With regard to Western Sahara, Burkina Faso welcomes for advanced autonomy status in Western Sahara, which is a credible the Moroccan initiative and realistic option for achieving a final solution acceptable to all. In the Middle East, we condemn the recent escalation of violence which has led to many casualties among civilian populations. Priority should be given to dialogue, and we hope that the unrestricted ceasefire that was signed between Palestinians and Israelis on 26 August 2014, under the auspices of the Arab Republic of Egypt, will lead to the establishment of a definitive peace between the two parties to the conflict. Accordingly, Burkina Faso welcomes the efforts of the international community aimed at creating a Palestinian State living side by side with Israel in peace, security and mutual respect. The establishment of international peace and security will be but hollow words as long as the issue of disarmament remains unresolved. Therefore, no sacrifice is too great if together we can achieve a world free of nuclear weapons, a reduction in the risk of the proliferation of conventional weapons, and the entry into force and universalization of the Arms Trade Treaty. To establish a permanent basis for peace, security and freedom, it is also necessary to create the conditions for sustainable and equitable development for all peoples. That is why my country reaffirms its strong commitment to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. We therefore have a deep interest in the development process under way for the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda, and we urge that special attention be given to vital sectors such as agriculture, renewable energy, industrialization and infrastructure. Burkina Faso reaffirms its commitment to the ideals of the United Nations based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, dialogue and peaceful settlement of disputes. It is with conviction that we welcome and strongly encourage the rapprochement of views between the Peoples Republic of China and the Republic of China on Taiwan and the dialogue that forms the basis for such an approach. We favour the wider participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the specialized agencies of the United Nations. We salute the spirit of understanding displayed by the international community in allowing the involvement of that country in international organizations in order to enable it to play a broader role on the world stage through its contribution to the achievement of development goals, particularly in countries like Burkina Faso. Readmitting the Republic of China on Taiwan to our Organization is worth considering. With 23 million inhabitants and a large economy, the Republic of China on Taiwan has established itself as a key player in the international arena in terms of promoting peace and contributing to development efforts. With regard to Cuba, Burkina Faso reiterates its position in favour of lifting the embargo in order to allow the Cuban people to fit harmoniously into the concert of nations. Convinced of the irreplaceable role of the United Nations in promoting multilateralism, my country supports the reforms under consideration, in particular those of the Security Council and the General Assembly. Given the nature of the new factors in the threats to international peace and security, it is necessary and equitable that other continents have permanent seats on the Security Council. That is why Burkina Faso endorses the African Common Position in favour of expanding the number of permanent members of the Security Council to take into account the expectations of the African continent. With everyones help and moved by a spirit of solidarity and sharing, we can strengthen the role of the United Nations as a genuine instrument of cooperation for peace, security, justice and development.
