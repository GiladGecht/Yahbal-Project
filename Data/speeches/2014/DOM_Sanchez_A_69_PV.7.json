{"speech":{"0":" It is an honour to participate in the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations by representing the people and the Government of the To achieve this, we have established a major domestic compact, which will be our top priority as a nation: namely, education. That is why we have doubled the current budget for public education and allocated to it 4 per cent of our gross domestic product. This will enable us to carry out the largest expansion of school infrastructure ever in our history and ensure that all girls and boys, without exception, will have access to quality public education. I am also proud to tell the Assembly that at the end of this year, thanks to the efforts of thousands of volunteers, we will be in a position to declare our country free of illiteracy. In health, that second pillar essential to the welfare State, we are also making significant progress. We have eliminated the co-payment for all public hospitals. Every year, we add 450,000 participants to the subsidized health insurance system. We are also giving priority to supporting small agricultural producers. We have been visiting rural communities every week for two years now, listening to people and seeking ways of helping them, such as by providing credits, training and infrastructure. The result of this, which is being monitored by the United Nations Development Programme, is a rebirth of the Dominican countryside, including improving its ability to feed the country and creating employment in rural communities. Thanks to that and other measures, over the past 18 months in the Dominican Republic overall poverty has been reduced by 6 per cent and poverty in rural areas by 9 per cent. In other words, in 18 months we have lifted more than half a million people out of poverty. We will continue to work tirelessly, implementing policies that put the economy at the service of the people and taking measures to combat poverty and inequality in a sustainable manner, and we will continue to create the basis of what one day will be a full welfare State in the Dominican Republic. the founding Charter of It is an honour for us to be one of the signatory nations of the United Nations, which, as everyone knows, assigned to the Organization its purpose of saving future generations from the scourge of war. We should recognize that 2014 is presenting major challenges to that noble purpose. In different latitudes of the world, there have been violent conflicts between communities, peoples or States. The contexts of those conflicts are varied, but one thing remains constant â€” the extent to which past grievances shape our identities today, and how dangerous it is to allow oneself to be submerged by them. We watch in perplexity and indignation the virulence with which these violent conflicts are waged in different parts of the world. The Middle East is once again the scene of the bloodiest sectarianism, which we condemn from this rostrum in all its manifestations. In the history of all nations or communities, without exception, there is a long history of disagreements, misunderstandings and quarrels that, at times, can be used to stir up the worst passions. They can be manipulated by individuals seeking to consolidate power or inflamed by extremist groups that feel that they have nothing to lose. There will always be someone who keeps old disputes alive. There will always be someone who does not mind sacrificing the true interests of the people at the time because of the wrongs of the past recorded in the history books. However, there are plenty of examples to the contrary. Throughout the world, there are people and countries that have managed to leave their past behind in order to focus on building the future that they want for their children and new generations. Whether it is building bridges between countries once in conflict, as the European Union did, or among communities that decided to share the same nation, as in the case of South Africa. Hope can and must find its way. I would also like, if I may, to bring a note of optimism from our Caribbean region. In the past year, we started a dialogue process with neighbouring Haiti that can rightly be regarded as historic. Our situation is of course unique but not to the degree that it cannot be echoed in other parts of the world. As members perhaps know, since the birth of our two Republics, there has been a long history of misunderstanding and disputes, which led to each of our countries having a distorted picture of the other. It is true that in our past there were a couple of painful chapters, which are part of our identity. However, if we limit our identity to those few chapters, it will be impoverished. Our history is very rich. It has hundreds of chapters. In many of them, we can find the inspiration to guide us towards a better future and a more complete, richer and more human identity because that is clearly an excellent basis for understanding. In both countries, there are millions of people who want better development, education, health care, security and jobs and more opportunities. Those are concrete demands that require specific measures. The truth is that, by responding to them and reaching agreements in each of those areas, in a few months we were able to achieve the progress that we had not made in decades. Little by little, we are moving forward. We are discovering that old wounds do not impede advancing on that path, but that they heal as we move forward. Our peoples demanded that we exercise the necessary courage to take the first step. We will continue to take steps until we achieve our goal of two free, sovereign and independent nations that, on the basis of their sovereignty, cooperate for the benefit of their respective peoples. I wish to take this opportunity from this rostrum at the General Assembly to make an appeal. As I have said, a new era in Dominican-Haitian relations has begun. In that new phase, we would like to enjoy the support of the international community. One of our main actions to strengthen Dominican sovereignty and to ensure the rights of people living in our territory is to provide them all the relevant documentation. As members know, many of those people are Haitian. In order to regularize their status in the territory of the Dominican Republic, they must first have identity papers from their country of origin, which many of them unfortunately lack. Haiti is making an effort to reach those Haitians and to provide them with documents that recognize them as its nationals. However, Haitis technical and economic resources are limited. In the past, a number of international organizations and countries have expressed their concern about the fate of Haitian migrants. We share that concern for humanitarian reasons and because it affects us as the main host country. I would therefore note that now is an excellent time to move from words to actions. With specific and relatively simple actions, the international community can have a major and lasting impact on the lives of those people. I appeal for help for Haiti. May the international community help Haiti to document its people in its territory and in ours, since documentation is the first essential step for the enjoyment of a wide-ranging body of rights. Let us not allow a few technical shortcomings to be an obstacle to such a hopeful and necessary process with as much potential as that new stage of cooperation between the Dominican Republic and Haiti. There are times when our best aspirations seem fragile. There are times when cynical people point out, under I do not know what law of the economy or in history, that we are bound to repeat the mistakes of the past. They say that poverty cannot be overcome, that the gap of inequality will always grow and that past grievances will be reborn in each new generation. However, we know that none of that is true. We know where to look to find the path of hope. We have only to look at those who are closest, that is, our own people, their basic daily needs and the hopes that motivate them to continue the struggle. If we look carefully, we see that the economy is not a prison but can be a tool for improving the lives of people. We find that the people are free. They are free to know which parts of their past they wish to use as a guide to their future and which they wish to leave aside. We will find a way to work together, as we have done with the neighbours with whom we share an island, or as we found yesterday, during the climate summit, with the other countries with which we share the planet. The citizens that we represent, increasingly better informed, demand that we live up to our responsibility and our declared commitment: to preserve peace, to promote development and to make education and health care the right of all inhabitants of the planet.
