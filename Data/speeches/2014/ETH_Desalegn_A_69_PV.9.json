{"speech":{"0":" It is indeed a great pleasure to see a seasoned African diplomat presiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I would like to express my warmest congratulations to him on his election to that high office. I know he is aware, as we are, that he is assuming his responsibility at one of the most critical periods in the history of this Organization and that of multilateralism in general. Those of us in the East African region know him very well as a friend and distinguished diplomat. We are confident that he will use his wisdom and experience to build consensus on a range of issues on the agenda of the General Assembly at this historic session and effectively guide its work. Let me therefore assure him of the full support and cooperation of my delegation in the successful discharge of his heavy responsibilities. I also wish to commend his predecessor for the excellent contribution he made to ensuring the success of the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Indeed, it was a remarkable session, which laid the foundation for the major task that lies ahead. This session is being held at a historic time, when we have embarked upon a major undertaking to shape the future we want for present and future generations. If we do what we must, it could be remembered in history as a session that helped us turn the corner in ensuring effective custodianship of the environment, economic justice and social responsibility. What we agreed over two years ago in Rio must be what galvanizes our common effort. We said then that poverty eradication is the greatest global challenge facing the world today and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. Last month, we marked 500 days until the target date for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which we have agreed to achieve by the end of 2015. In Africa, robust economic growth has been registered over the past decade, and the stereotypical narrative about the continent is slowly changing. Africa is now the rising continent, offering tremendous opportunities for trade and investment. Notable progress has also been made towards achieving the MDGs, including in my own country, Ethiopia. There are nonetheless many remaining challenges, such as with respect to reducing the maternal death rate. It is therefore necessary, as we move forward in the negotiations to formulate the post-2015 development agenda, not to overlook the fact that the MDGs are still unfinished business. The post-2015 development agenda will be complete when it rests on a satisfactory outcome in terms of the implementation of the MDGs. Accordingly, the remaining months should be used to accelerate their implementation. Moreover, the post- 2015 development agenda will need to make provision for concluding any aspects of the MDGs that might have to be carried beyond 2015. What we have done thus far in connection with laying the groundwork for the post-2015 development agenda, both at the intergovernmental level and that of the Secretariat, has been encouraging. The Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals has successfully completed its work, and the two co-chairs must be commended for the contribution they have made. It would be proper, as the Assembly decided at its sixty-eighth session, to use the Open Working Groups proposals as a basis for integrating sustainable development goals into the post-2015 development agenda. I would also like to express appreciation to the Secretary-General for the efforts he has made in that regard, in conformity with the request contained in the outcome document (resolution ) of the 2010 MDG Summit. The work of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda has been significant. We are particularly appreciative of the invaluable contribution made by the United Nations System Task Team on the Post-2015 United Nations Development Agenda. We look forward to the synthesis report by the Secretary-General, which we trust will help facilitate effective conversation among Member States and productive intergovernmental negotiations with a view to formulating a post-2015 development agenda that reflects the interests of present and future generations by next year. We have no doubt that a post-2015 development agenda that responds to the major challenges the world faces must rest on a readiness to foster cooperation, based on the principle of equitable and common but differentiated responsibilities. It is difficult to imagine that the difficult but indispensable issues surrounding the means of implementation can be resolved unless there is flexibility on the question of common but differentiated responsibilities. One thing is clear in all this. The world has the capacity and resources to effectively respond to the pressing needs we see, to eradicate poverty and ensure sustainable development for all. That has been affirmed by the advance unedited report of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing. The Committee has not offered us definitive proposals, but rather recommendations designed, as they say, to stimulate discussions. It has nonetheless expressed its hope that progress will be made on development financing at third International Conference on Financing for Development, which is to take place in Addis Ababa in July 2015. Let me affirm our commitment to doing our best to ensure that that historic and extremely critical conference succeeds. It appears to us to be obvious that the effectiveness of the post-2015 agenda depends, among other things, on the success of the Addis Ababa conference. At any rate, it is with that conviction that we will proceed to discharge our responsibility as the host country. the This is also the time when we are striving to achieve an ambitious target that we have set for ourselves: that is, to reach a globally binding climate agreement by 2015 that will limit the rise in the global temperature to below 2 Celsius. Let me once again express my appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for convening the Climate Summit two days ago. I hope the outcome of the Summit will help us to make progress in achieving this fundamental objective by catalysing action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and strengthening climate resilience. Needless to say, we in Africa are already facing the brunt of climate change, and this is undermining our efforts to meet our development aspirations, including the Millennium Development Goals. For us, adaptation and mitigation remain a priority, and we need urgent international support for our efforts in that regard. Although we have contributed virtually nothing to global warming, we are indeed playing a leading role in terms of mitigation by scaling up our efforts in renewable energy and promoting energy efficiency. It is only fair and proper that that be adequately recognized and supported. There can be no doubt that the challenge posed by climate change requires leadership and political commitment at all levels. We have no choice but to rise to that challenge by taking concrete actions to help reduce emissions and demonstrating the necessary political will to achieve a globally binding climate agreement by 2015 in Paris. Failure is not an option. What we see here at the United Nations is a readiness on the part of States to think big and focus on what unites us. That is what underlies the complex negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda. In sharp contrast to that, what we are witnessing today is a general deterioration of the global security situation. The world is passing through a turbulent period, and that is not an exaggeration. The proliferation and intensity of conflicts have significantly increased. In our part of the world, progress made over the past decade is being undermined by new cycles of violence and conflict. The crisis in South Sudan is an example. We in the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) region are doing everything we can to resolve the South Sudanese crisis through peaceful means with the support of the United Nations, the African Union and international partners. But progress, let alone a breakthrough, has not been easy to come by. The situation highlights an often encountered challenge. Progress in peacemaking can hardly be contemplated when there is a lack of sufficient commitment to a peaceful resolution of a crisis by the parties to the conflict. But IGAD is determined to expend every possible effort to find a lasting solution to the crisis through an all-inclusive political dialogue. In contrast with the situation in South Sudan and with situations in many parts of the world, the situation in Somalia has been improving over the course of the year. Al-Shabaab may not have been entirely removed as a threat, but it has been greatly degraded. The recent setback it suffered is bound to speed up its demise. The military gains made on the ground cannot, however, be sustained without progress on the political track through the establishment of local administrations and the maintenance of law and order in the newly liberated areas. In that regard, we welcome the establishment of interim local administrations in central and south- west Somalia in line with the provisional Federal Constitution. We need to continue to support Somalia in its efforts to rebuild itself and make a successful transition by 2016. Conflict is not an exclusively African phenomenon. What has become obvious lately is how much the global security situation is becoming a source of concern. Never since the end of the cold war has the global security situation been as fragile as it is today. The threat of terrorism has affected ever greater and wider areas of the world. At no time over the past many decades has the need for effective cooperation at the international and regional levels been as pressing and as urgent as it is today. That the issue of foreign fighters has become a source of major concern to many is obvious. What is required to make progress in addressing the challenge is a readiness to forge cooperation that brooks no double standards. We need to be resolute in our determination to work together. All that means that at no time in recent memory has multilateralism been as immensely crucial for the future of the world as it is today. The fact that nations are driven by the pursuit of national interests has always been self-evident. But at this juncture in world history and in the light of the many common challenges that we all face, we have no more realistic option than a commitment to enlightened national interest, which can be promoted only within the framework of multilateralism. That, in our view, is the sentiment that we should all share at the beginning of the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We cannot be oblivious to the nexus between our sustainable development agenda and the global situation of peace and security. “Delivering on and transformative post-2015 development agenda”, the theme of this session, requires a peaceful and stable global environment. It is also in that context that the threat of the spread of the Ebola virus should be viewed. It is both a humanitarian and a security challenge. Containing the spread of the deadly virus should be a matter of utmost priority. implementing a Let me reiterate that it is critical that we collectively address the myriad of peace and security challenges facing our world in order to facilitate progress in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals in the remaining period and to lay a solid foundation for the realization of our transformative agenda in the post- 2015 era, as well as to achieve a meaningful climate agreement. I wish to conclude by stressing Ethiopias commitment to multilateralism, to joining hands with all like-minded countries in order to contribute to regional and international peace and security and to the successful realization of the major projects that we will undertake in connection with the post-2015 agenda. As a founding member of the Organization and as a member of the League of Nations — although Ethiopia was abandoned by the League — Ethiopia attaches the highest priority to cooperation among peoples and countries with a view to addressing common challenges. It is our conviction that might does not make right. There is no substitute for the pursuit of mutual advantages as a guideline for a realistic and just foreign policy. That is our guide for all the friendships and partnerships we have and will continue to develop. "}}
