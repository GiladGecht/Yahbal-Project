{"speech":{"0":"156)(spoke in english)secondly, let us change our tone. on my travels not long ago, i saw a roadside sign that said, \u201cfear god\u201d. a few miles down the road, was another, saying the same thing, then another and then a final one, saying, \u201c... or you will go to hell\u201d, and i asked myself when and how did fear and intimidation creep so insidiously into our conversations, when there is so much more to be said about the love of god. most people may think they have nothing to do with the hate expressed by extremists. but our world is also threatened when violence, fear and anger dominate our discourse, whether in school lessons, weekly sermons or international affairs.thirdly, let us act upon our beliefs. and here, i mean more than praying, fasting or zakat \u2014 giving alms. i mean integrating our values into every part of our daily lives and every hour of every day. by loving our neighbour, showing respect to those different from us and being kind to our own children, each one of us can do something to reflect the spirit of our creator.fourthly, let us amplify the voice of moderation. it is one of the greatest ironies of our time that extremist voices use advanced media to propagate ignorant ideas. we must not let our screens, airwaves, broadband and social media be monopolized by those who pose the greatest danger to our world. we too must populate our media and, more important, the minds of our young people, with the purity and power of moderation.fifthly, let us recognize deceit. when we examine the motives of those outlaws, the khawarij, and, indeed, the motives of extremists on all sides, we find hunger for power, control of people, of money and of land. they use religion as a mask. is there a worse crime than twisting gods word to promote ones own interests? is there a more despicable act than feeding on the vulnerable and innocent, to recruit them to ones ranks? in the global muslim community \u2014 1.7 billion good men and women, one quarter of humankind \u2014 todays outlaw gangs are nothing but a drop in the ocean. but a drop of venom can poison a well. we must protect the purity of our faith from worldly contamination. as muslims, this is our fight, as it is our duty.sixthly, by all means, let us be intolerant of intolerance. extremists rely on the apathy of moderates. but moderation does not mean accepting those who trample on others and rejecting all those who differ. todays global fight is not between peoples, communities or religions. it is between all moderates of all faiths against all extremists, in all religions. leaders of every country, every belief and every neighbourhood need to take a clear and public stand against intolerance of any kind. that includes respecting all places where god is worshipped, whether mosque, church, synagogue or temple.and nothing can be more important and can have more impact in framing this respect and coexistence than jerusalem. the hashemite custodianship of jerusalems islamic and christian holy sites is a sacred duty, and we join muslims and christians everywhere in rejecting threats to the holy places and the arab character of that holy city.lastly, there is hyperconnectivity. in our era, connectivity defines how we live and interact in our work, our communities, our schools and our lives. only a few years ago, we were introduced to the internet of computers; now, we talk about the internet 15-29265 23\/5728\/09\/2015 a\/70\/pv.13of things. but over them all must be the internet of humankind \u2014 a hyperconnection, bringing us together in collective consciousness and common cause. by gathering here today, we acknowledge that the power of working together far exceeds any individual effort. our great general assembly must address urgent world issues: sustainable and inclusive development that can deliver more opportunities, especially to young people, and peaceful, political solutions to regional crises.it is the worlds obligation to find solutions and provide relief for the millions of refugees in my region. today, we are still facing huge shortfalls, cuts and threats to vital united nations programmes and agencies, including the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east, the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees and the world food programme.today, we are haunted by the images of thousands of refugees on the shores and borders of europe, seeking hope, far away from their homeland. in jordan, we have been faced with that challenge since the beginning of the syrian crisis. today, syrian refugees alone constitute 20 per cent of my countrys population.we have been relieving the international community of a significant part of the burden of that humanitarian disaster since the beginning. support to our country has been a small fraction of the cost we have endured. it is high time for the international community to act collectively in facing this unprecedented humanitarian crisis and to provide support to countries such as jordan and lebanon, which have been carrying the brunt of that burden over the past four years.in all these areas, we must act, and act collectively, for the future of our world. and connectivity is key. the values we share \u2014 equality, compassion and hope \u2014 need to be connected to everything we do. and we must keep ourselves connected to each other, for the good of all. these bonds are the power and promise of our united nations. here, together, we can and must create the future our people need \u2014 a safer, stronger world of coexistence, inclusion, shared prosperity and peace. seven steps can bring us closer to our destination. god willing, our countries and peoples will achieve those seven steps and many more."}}
