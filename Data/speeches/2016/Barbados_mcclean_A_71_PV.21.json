barbados. it coincides with the celebration this year of two historic anniversaries. on 30 november, we celebrate our fiftieth anniversary of independence and nationhood, followed closely by our fiftieth anniversary of membership in the united nations.one of the cornerstones on which the foreign policy of barbados is built is our unwavering commitment to the united nations. we see the united nations as the core of an effective multilateral system, with responsibility for addressing issues of international peace, security and development. today, 50 years on, barbados stands more firmly committed to the principle of multilateralism. for the united nations to deliver on our expectations, its organizational structure must reflect the geopolitical realities of the twenty-first century. we therefore support efforts to reform the security council and to revitalize the general assembly.the theme of this years general assembly is \u201cthe sustainable development goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d. we must act now to make the vision of 2030 a reality. barbados believes that partnership and collaboration will be the keys to fulfilling the promise a\/71\/pv.21

the united nations systems support for sids, and we look forward to tangible improvements as a result of its work.last week, i was pleased to participate in the launch, in barbados, of the caribbean human development report 2016. the theme of the report is \u201cmultidimensional progress: human resilience beyond income\u201d. it highlights the unique situation of the small island developing

coordinated action at the international level to address the sources and consequences of our vulnerability. the prime minister of barbados was one of the leaders who participated in the formal signing ceremony of the landmark paris agreement on climate change in april. he deposited the instrument of ratification on the same occasion. we look forward to its early entry into force. at the national level, barbados has developed a national climate change policy framework that works seamlessly with the barbados sustainable development policy to address issues of climate adaptation and mitigation.barbados exercises jurisdiction over maritime space that far exceeds its very limited land territory. we therefore recognize the vast potential of the ocean and its sustainable exploitation as an important component of our future development. we are also developing a comprehensive national ocean governance strategyto address the sustainable management of our maritime space and the sustainable use of barbados marine living and non-living resources. as we seek to protect and preserve our oceans and seas for future generations, barbados will continue to participate actively in the

support for the caribbean sea resolution. our ultimate aim is the designation of the caribbean sea as a special area in the context of sustainable development. we count on your support.barbadians are a proud and industrious people. with minimal natural resources and the constraints of small size and vulnerability to natural and man-made disasters, our people have achieved a significant level of human development in 50 years of independence. we have done so by dint of hard work, sacrifice and faith. we remain resolute in our determination to overcome the many obstacles we face: the unilateral and unidimensional graduation policies of international development agencies that penalize us for progress in human development, while ignoring our obvious vulnerabilities; the negative impact of the economic and financial decisions of international financial and other institutions, illustrated by the consequences of de-risking on correspondent banking activity; and the persistent and unwarranted attacks on our international financial services sector, accompanied by the imposition of onerous conditionalities. those actions threaten our economic stability and our ability to participate in global financial, trade and economic systems. they undermine our capacity to achieve the full implementation of the sustainable development goals. we call for dialogue with development partners and greater policy space and policy f lexibility for sids.the united nations was born of the post-war desire of nations for international peace and security. 24\/09\/2016 a\/71\/pv.2116-29817

states guatemala and venezuela. barbados welcomes the recent steady progress towards the normalization of bilateral relations between cuba and the united states of america. we look forward to the dismantling of the final vestiges of that long-standing embargo.on that memorable evening on 30 november 1966, as the national f lag of barbados was unfurled for the first time, there was a sense of exultation, expectation and pride. our first prime minister stated in his first address to the general assembly:\u201chumility must be the most appropriate feeling for the leader of a state admitted to membership of this illustrious assembly on the basis of sovereign equality.\u201d (a\/pv.1487, para. 72)half a century later, we believe that both independence and membership in the united nations have served us well and afforded us the opportunity to pursue the goals which have informed the progress that we have achieved. looking forward, we are committed to the successful implementation of the 2030 agenda. we expect it to guarantee further development of the barbadian economy and society and to serve as our contribution to the universal push to transform our world."}}
