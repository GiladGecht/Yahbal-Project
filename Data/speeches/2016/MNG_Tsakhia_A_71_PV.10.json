{"speech":{"0":" At the outset, I wish to join others in extending our heartfelt congratulations to the President on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. Mongolia pledges its full support to the President. It is my great honour to address this body for the seventh time on behalf of the Mongolian people. I am the youngest of eight sons. For generations, my family lived as nomadic herdsmen in the western highlands of my country. My mother and father never dreamed that, one day, their youngest son would be speaking from this respected rostrum to the largest assembly in the world. I am proud to serve for my country in accordance with the free will of our people. Mongolia is governed by democratic rules. The President has a constitutional term limit. Therefore, my mandate ends next year. This is my last address as the President of Mongolia to the General Assembly. But the people of Mongolia will continue to be citizens of the global community together with all nations. I am proud that my country is a good friend and partner of every State Member of the United Nations. I am confident that our next President will be welcomed by everyone here and will be given the same respect and the same spirit of cooperation that I have enjoyed during these years. "}}
