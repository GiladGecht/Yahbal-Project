choice in a world witnessing great challenges. in that regard, mauritania plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of international peace and security in the sahel and the sahara regions through a comprehensive approach based on openness, dialogue, professionalism and firmness. our efforts have been crowned with success against terrorist groups after fierce battles in 2010 and 2011.\u201cin
