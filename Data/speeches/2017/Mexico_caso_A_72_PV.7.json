{"speech":{"0":" I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Government and the people of Mexico, to thank the Assembly from the bottom of our hearts for the countless expressions of international solidarity from our fellow members of the United Nations.Yesterday a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck Mexico City and various areas in the centre of the country. The death toll currently stands at 219, with hundreds injured and still more whose whereabouts are unknown. Our current priority is carrying out rescue work and caring for the injured. It has been a harsh blow to Mexico, but we will be able to recover, thanks primarily to the extraordinary solidarity and generosity of our people, who have taken to the streets and to the more than 50 areas affected by the quake, where we need everyones help.I particularly wish to thank Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who called me personally, and the Secretariat, which has been in contact with us from the outset, providing us with advice, support and help in identifying the specific aid we need. Special thanks also go to the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination system for helping us to identify the countries that have the specialized teams and equipment we need for rescue operations. We have contacted them and they are already sending assistance. Support for the rescue efforts is currently under way in Mexico City. I thank the President and all of the countries that are generously supporting Mexico at this very difficult time.Address by Mr. Sauli Niinisto, President of the Republic of Finland"}}
