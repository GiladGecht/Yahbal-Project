{"speech":{"0":" inequality remains the main cause of most of the difficulties and threats that we face. we all know that, with the current advances in science and technology, poverty and hunger are unacceptable, and issues stemming from poor organization and the inequitable distribution of power and national and international resources are the cause of their unjustifiable persistence. for that reason, we reiterate that the rule of law and development are inextricably linked and mutually reinforcing. both are therefore essential to sustainable development at the national and international levels.uruguay fully endorse the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the commitment to leave no one behind. it pledges its unqualified support for that commitment, without any preconditions. it is a commitment that can be undertaken in a straightforward manner by a country such as ours, which throughout its history has made the fight against abandonment one of the marks of its identity and succeeded in building, from a relatively early stage, a reasonably integrated society with a significant degree of social cohesion, although not without having to confront challenges and difficulties.in july, at the high-level political forum on sustainable development, my country, for the second year in a row, submitted its voluntary national report on the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, which involved carrying out a regular process of consultations and interinstitutional coordination with the participation of the government, academia, civil society, the private sector and international organizations, with respect to its implementation of the sustainable development goals.however, there is an issue on the united nations agenda that is even more vital for uruguay \u2014 disarmament as a prelude to peace. the international community must be committed to actively seeking effective solutions to this global problem. the growing threat of terrorism and the challenge it poses to the international community as a whole, the risk of the potential use of weapons of mass destruction by terrorist groups, and the acquisition and use of conventional weapons and the links of such weapons with transnational crime have made the failure to disarm one of the greatest threats facing humankind. it is therefore a matter of deep concern. controlling the international arms trade is an urgent necessity, given that trafficking and arms deals with warring parties in conflicts contribute directly to the suffering and murder of civilians.for that reason, the accession to and ratification of international instruments intended to protect civilians, such as the historic arms trade treaty, are a great contribution to that end. and let me repeat here in the general assembly something that has already been mentioned in the security council. according to the stockholm international peace research institute, 74 per cent of the total volume of arms exports in the period 2011-2015 was carried out specifically by the five permanent members of the security council. similarly, military spending in 2016 was $1.69 trillion, which was higher than in 2015.we should ask ourselves how many needs could have been met had those funds been redirected to 25\/09\/2017 a\/72\/pv.2317-29852 3\/38the economic and social development of countries. the possession of nuclear weapons and the delay in disarmament by the states that possess them also endanger and threaten the worlds stability and human security. if the proliferation of nuclear weapons overtakes diplomacy, the consequences will be devastating. diplomacy, diplomacy and more diplomacy: that is the path that we must take.the use and threat of use of nuclear weapons constitute a crime against humankind and a serious violation of international law, including international humanitarian law, as well as of the charter of the united nations. the only guarantee against the use and threat of use of those weapons is their explicit prohibition and total elimination. nevertheless, far from abandoning their weapons programmes, the nuclear powers continue to improve and actively modernize their nuclear arsenals. data from specialized organizations indicate that nine countries have more than 17,000 nuclear weapons, of which approximately 2,000 are on high alert, ready to be launched at a moments notice.uruguay welcomes the success of the united nations conference that negotiated a binding instrument to ban nuclear weapons and bring about their total elimination. it concluded with the adoption of the historic treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, recently opened to all states for signature, and to which uruguay has just acceded. in that regard, we call on all countries to sign the instrument, which aims to ensure a dignified life for future generations and avoid a humanitarian catastrophe.as part of its concern about the development of nuclear weapons, uruguay expresses its strong condemnation of north koreas nuclear tests and ballistic-missile launches and urges that country to abandon its existing nuclear programmes in a complete, verifiable and irreversible way, putting an immediate end to all related activities, including launches using ballistic-missile technology, and other acts of provocation.in the same vein, we urge that country to respect the relevant resolutions of the security council and return to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, which it abandoned in 2003, and the international atomic energy agency safeguards regime. however, we also urge all countries, in particular the great united states, to avoid the verbal escalations that have always preceded major tragedies throughout history and weigh every word in a responsible manner, eschewing all violent rhetoric. a dynamic of antagonism often makes it impossible to stick to the facts.in addressing the 3rd meeting of the general assembly at its seventy-second session, our secretary-general, mr. antonio guterres, made reference to \u201csleepwalking our way to war\u201d, inspired by the eloquent title recently used by the historian christopher clark to describe how human beings and nations marched into the tragedy of the first world war, dazed and confused by mutual misunderstandings and unheeded warnings. when they became aware of the outcome, it was too late.just three months before ending its term as a non-permanent member of the security council, uruguay wishes to emphasize once again that it is firmly convinced of the importance of focusing its efforts on protecting civilian populations in all conflict zones by using different modalities, through peacekeeping operations and the delivery of humanitarian assistance, by, inter alia, protecting hospitals and medical personnel and denouncing f lagrant violations of human rights.in the current context of crisis, we wish to acknowledge the bravery and altruism of humanitarian personnel as they continue to assist, at the risk of their own lives, those in need in conflict situations. we understand that the best way to honour humanitarian workers, who have saved thousands of lives in numerous settings, is to devise successful policies and reach agreement within the framework of the united nations to bring about the immediate cessation of attacks on civilians, while making possible the delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in conflict situations. we are concerned at the increasing number of attacks on and deliberate bombings of civilians, humanitarian workers and civil infrastructure such as hospitals, schools and markets, all of which are serious human rights violations.the ultimate atrocity is when defenceless human beings are attacked while they are assisting other defenceless human beings at the worst times and in the worst places. not only should we emphatically condemn this, but we should also adopt resolutions to protect victims and bring perpetrators to justice. uruguay once again calls for full compliance with security council resolutions, especially resolution 2286 (2016), and the establishment of effective mechanisms for its a\/72\/pv.23 25\/09\/20174\/38 17-29852implementation. i wish to reiterate that this kind of attack against civilian targets, disguised as collateral attacks, should never be tolerated.it is undeniable that we are experiencing deep-seated changes in the kinds of conflicts we are seeing. the increasing presence of terrorist organizations and non-state actors spreads fear among populations and disproportionately undermines the rights of women and children. history has shown us that there is a constant pattern in terms of conflicts in the world, regardless of region or religion. women and girls are those who suffer the consequences most. war invades their lives, threatening their sense of security.in this context, as an elected member of the security council, a country with a long-standing participation in various peacekeeping operations and an active troop contributor, uruguay is intent on fighting sexual exploitation and abuse in armed conflicts. we are deeply committed to the zero-tolerance policy. we reiterate our support for this policy and are working very hard to prevent new cases of abuse and sexual exploitation in peacekeeping operations, with the understanding that a single case is one too many.for more than 50 years, uruguay knew what it was like to be outside the most important decision-making body in the world. that is why we believe it is vital that the issues taken up by the security council be public knowledge for all members of the united nations. what is discussed there is of such importance that all states present here today should be aware of what goes on behind closed doors. that is why uruguay will continue working towards more transparent and inclusive working methods in the united nations within the framework of the accountability, coherence and transparency group, as well as in other multilateral contexts. as a signatory to the charter of the united nations, uruguay emphasizes its commitment to the purposes and principles of the united nations while committing itself to working tirelessly to sustain those principles, which we believe are vital for building a safer and more prosperous future.we cannot even think of peace in the world if the international community does not make a serious commitment to disarmament and non-proliferation. any progress in disarmament and non-proliferation \u2014 be it serious commitments; gradual, effective, specific steps forward; or results \u2014 must be welcomed and celebrated as a tremendous achievement of the united nations.we wish to conclude our statement by highlighting the overarching historical significance of the peace process that has been gaining ground in colombia and putting an end to the armed conflicts that divided it, drowning it in pain and blood for many long decades. as uruguayans, as latin americans and, in this case, as the then president of the security council, we are pleased and proud to have made a modest contribution to the building of peace in colombia. this is the best example we have when we talk about specific results.it is our latin america that we have made a region of peace today. the great note of hope that has sounded when this ceasefire and the peace agreement were reached gives us the enthusiasm we need to take on the new and difficult missions in other parts of the world in which the way out often seems difficult to see. latin america has single-mindedly rejected all attempts to resolve internal conflicts in latin america, no matter how intense they are, through military intervention.in the historical experience of our continent, such interventions have only left a trail of lasting violence, poverty and instability. latin america is united as a block against interventionist war-mongering endeavours that are neither rational nor prudent.i would like to reiterate once again our emphatic rejection of the unfair blockade which, after 55 years, is still looming over our sister republic of cuba, and we express our sympathy and condolences in connection with the victims of the hurricanes and earthquakes that recently affected the region.in conclusion, achieving a sustainable planet and a decent life requires the effective use of existing resources so that we can live in peace and security and our legacy can be a habitable world for future generations."}}
