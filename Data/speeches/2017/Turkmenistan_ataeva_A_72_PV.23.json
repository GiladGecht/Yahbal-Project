and protecting the legal and institutional foundations that are at the basis of the modern world order are the main task of the countries of the united nations and of the largest international organizations, and that requires of them closer and more coordinated cooperation. the degree of effectiveness of such cooperation will in its turn largely determine the success of solutions to other global problems, including the environment, energy and food-related issues, combating terrorism, drug trafficking and other challenges.today the effective and uncompromising struggle against terrorism has become the imperative of global development. it is clear that terrorism in all its forms is a deliberate challenge to the civilized world. in point of fact, terrorism as a phenomenon threatens to undermine the entire system of global security and its political and moral foundations. we strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and recognize that the prevention of terrorism

key areas of our countrys strategic cooperation with the united nations. as a result of the comprehensive work that had been carried out jointly with the united nations since october 2015 at the
