MILAN KUCAN, PRESIDENT OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC OF \r\nSLOVENIA \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nPresident of the presidency of the Republic of Slovenia. \r\nMr. Milan Kucan. President of the Presidency of the Republic of Slovenia-\r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations the President of the presidency of the \r\nRepublic of Slovenia, His Excellency Mr. Milan Kucan, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\nPresident KUCAN (spoke in Slovenian; English text furnished by the \r\ndelegation): Allow me to congratulate you. Sir, and the friendly nation of \r\nBulgaria on your election as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nforty-seventh session. We are convinced that under your leadership the \r\nGeneral Assembly will be successful. I should also like to take this \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n3, \r\n(President Kucan) \r\nopportunity to express my appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Samir Shihabi, \r\nAmbassador of Saudi Arabia, for the creative and constructive manner in which \r\nhe guided the forty-sixth session. \r\nA number of newly independent European States, including Slovenia, have \r\nbecome new Members of the United Nations and are taking part in this session \r\nof the General Assembly. This reality, until recently almost beyond \r\nimagination in the context of the traditional view of international relations, \r\ncame about through the process of democratization, which dramatically brought \r\nto a close the period of absolute ideologies that formed the basis of various \r\nforms of authoritarianism and totalitarianism. \r\nThe far-reaching changes brought about by the end of the cold war have \r\nconfronted the international community and the United Nations with new \r\nproblems. The futility of attempts to solve the Yugoslav crisis and to stop \r\nthe war against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which in all its \r\ntragic dimensions is taking place in our immediate neighbourhood, is another \r\nindication of the insufficiency of current institutional arrangements in the \r\nworld. This applies both to the United Nations and to regional organizations \r\nthat complement the universality of the United Nations. \r\nOur international institutional arrangements were made in the \r\ncircumstances of a world divided into political and military blocs. The \r\nprimary function of those arrangements was to palliate the effects of \r\nideological, political and military confrontation by maintaining a balance of \r\npower and a balance of fear and through understandings reached between the \r\ngreat Powers. In the context of such a world order, there was insufficient \r\ncommitment to enhancing cooperation and integration, to facilitating the \r\nnecessary evolution of the modem world as required by the nature of \r\nA/47VPV.11 \r\n4-5 \r\n(President Kucan) \r\ntechnology, to the organization of production, to free markets, to the \r\nresponsibility for coordinated and accelerated economic development, to \r\novercoming poverty, to the protection of the human environment and to the \r\nuniversalization of communications and information. \r\nA/47 /PV. 11 \r\n?, \r\n(President Kucan) \r\nopportunity to express my appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Samir Shihabi, \r\nAmbassador of Saudi Arabia, for the creative and constructive manner in which \r\nhe guided the forty-sixth session. \r\nA number of newly independent European States, including Slovenia, have \r\nbecome new Members of the United Nations and are taking part in this session \r\nof the General Assembly.

The CSCE was \r\nconstructed and developed on the basic principles enshrined in the United \r\nNations Charter and which constitute a vital precondition for the security, \r\npeace, welfare and progress of all. All CSCE participating States were \r\ntherefore expected to agree voluntarily to those principles in their own \r\ninterest. However, the CSCE was left without suitable means to respond to \r\nsituations in which a State violated and did not respect those principles and \r\nnorms. \r\nThe war in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and all the horrors \r\nwhich, thanks to the media, are known to the whole world, as well as the \r\nBalkan crisis, in which we were also involved, are an important experience for \r\nthe CSCE, for the United Nations and for the world at large. \r\nIt teaches us that it is relatively simple to plead for peace. It is \r\nmuch more difficult to guarantee security and to create the stable conditions \r\nthat would allow urgent and peaceful changes in accordance with the principles \r\nupholding peace, security and prosperity. This is the most important function \r\nof the United Nations and of all regional organizations and is the basis of \r\nour support for the proposal that the United Nations should rapidly create \r\nmechanisms for adjusting to emerging changes in the world. \r\nIn his report \"An Agenda for Peace\", the Secretary-General has made an \r\nexceptionally cogent contribution to efforts to ensure the gradual \r\nestablishment of security machinery that will enable the peaceful settlement \r\nof all disputes, primarily through an insight into the circumstances and the \r\nA/477 PV.il \r\n7 \r\n(President Kucan) \r\ntimely mobilization of international institutions, to prevent or quickly cut \r\nshort armed conflicts between States Members of the United Nations and between \r\nsovereign States. It is in the interest of the international community that a \r\nwar, if it occurs, does not spread to new regions and countries. The report \r\ncontains many useful ideas about the building of peace after the conflict has \r\nbeen brought to an end and about when it becomes possible and necessary to \r\ncreate conditions for long-term security and stability in relations between \r\nthe participants in the conflict. \r\nThe United Nations may establish machinery which will enable it to \r\nintervene speedily to help the democratization of international and internal \r\nrelations and implementation of self-determination and thus prevent lapsing \r\ninto the kind of violence that is now tragically escalating in the Balkans. \r\nThe United Nations has in the past been a forum for achieving the \r\nself-determination of many peoples. As such it was supported by Slovenia \r\nwhich, through its active role in the Allied anti-fascist coalition as part of \r\nformer Yugoslavia, was among the Founding Members of the Organization. It is \r\ntherefore understandable that we expect the United Nations to continue in this \r\nrole the future. \r\nThe world Organization has ever more Members. This is not the result or \r\nexpression of some incomprehensible process of fragmentation: it is an \r\nexpression of democratization of relations within those non-traditional States \r\nwhich were built not on the principle of national equality and the real common \r\ninterest of their nations but on ideologies, on fear of bloc threats. In \r\nthese multi-national States the levers of integration were not economic \r\nsuccess and respect for the welfare and dignity of man, but rather \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n8 \r\n(President Kucan) \r\nmonopolistic ideologies and a unitary party and army. In these States the \r\ninterests and dignity of people and nations were mainly subordinated to the \r\ninterests of the State and party or its apparatus. \r\nStates such as Yugoslavia which, from a historical point of view, were \r\nartificial creations should have constantly re-examined and demonstrated their \r\nraison d\u0027etre in the light of changing historical circumstances. Their \r\ndisintegration is not a priori in contradiction with the logic and needs of \r\nintegration. It is part of the same process. Individual nations enter the \r\nprocess of integration at different points. With the formation of their own \r\nStates, they create the conditions necessary in order to enter the process of \r\ntheir own free will. \r\nWe cannot exclude the possibility that new links and cooperation among \r\nStates will emerge. It is essential that such links must first conform to the \r\nprinciples of international law, democracy, and respect for universally \r\nrecognized standards for the protection of human rights and the rights of \r\nminorities and nations. \r\nThe trend of the pre-modern world was towards the concentration of power \r\nthrough the conquest of territory and war. The trend of the modern world is \r\nincreasingly economic through cooperation and association, through improvement \r\nof the quality of life and respect for natural limitations trends which \r\nwere at least partly defined at the recent world ecological summit. Slovenia \r\nis situated in an area where the pre-modern and modern worlds meet in both \r\nperception and in practice. It is in the interest of the United Nations and \r\nof all nations of the modern world, so that the modern world will border only \r\non the modern world. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n• 9-10 \r\n(President Kucan) \r\nAllow me to suggest that after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the \r\ndemocratization of Eastern Europe, the democratic world did not respond with \r\nas much commitment as it did, justifiably, in the introduction of the values \r\nof democracy and the market economy. The world was insufficiently prepared \r\nfor this epochal event. It is only now seeking and implementing models and \r\nmechanisms for overcoming and preventing the deterioration of relations \r\nbetween some of the new States. The London Conference, which tried to pave \r\nthe way towards a political solution of the Balkan crisis, was a successful \r\nexpression of this common search. \r\nThe denial to the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Serbia and \r\nMontenegro - of participation in the General Assembly of the United Nations, a \r\nmove that was supported by Slovenia, is convincing proof that the United \r\nNations is capable of showing the necessary decisiveness in order to condemn \r\nthe States that flagrantly violate the United Nations Charter and, above all, \r\npeace, security and human rights. \r\nAfter the final defeat and withdrawal of the Yugoslav army from Slovenia \r\na year ago, armed conflicts flared up ever further from Slovenia. In the \r\nprocess of seeking a solution, Slovenia has worked as a constructive and \r\nobjective participant in the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia, unselfishly \r\npresided over by Lord Carrington, and now the London Conference, to which it \r\nis currently committed. Our most immediate and most direct interest is in the \r\nsolution of humanitarian problems and, in particular, the situation of the \r\nmore than 70,000 refugees in our country. Our other basic interest relates to \r\nthe settlement of all issues of State succession of the former Socialist \r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia. It goes without saying that our ultimate \r\nobjective is the establishment of a durable peace in the Balkans. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n11 \r\n(President Kucan) \r\nSlovenia is not in dispute with any of the nations of the former \r\nYugoslavia. In accordance with the decisions of the London Conference, we \r\nsupport measures against the policies of Serbia and Montenegro and we oppose \r\ntheir attempt to usurp the succession of the Socialist Federal Republic of \r\nYugoslavia. It is not hard to see that it was the recent policies of these \r\ntwo republics, which today go by the name of the Federal Republic of \r\nYugoslavia, that caused the disintegration of Yugoslavia, by enforced \r\ndomination over the others, by a reinforcement of a centralist and \r\nundemocratic political system, and by force and seizure; later by war, \r\nterritorial conquest, \"ethnic cleansing\", concentration camps and other crimes \r\nwhich must be the subject of judicial investigation and trial; and finally by \r\ncontempt for all the civilized values that form the basis of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and key documents of the Conference on Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE). \r\nThe Helsinki Final Act is undoubtedly one of those invaluable codes of \r\nbehaviour a guide to the development of human rights, respect for borders \r\nand their openness and the protection of minorities which, through general \r\nrespect, regulate the process of the democratization of relations between \r\nnations and States in a peaceful framework. \r\nThe authorities of the former Yugoslavia did not really accept the \r\nHelsinki principles. They did not believe that signing the document bound \r\nthem to respect them. The tragedy in the Balkans would not have occurred had \r\nthe Helsinki principles been respected and implemented in the former \r\nYugoslavia. It could have been avoided. Even once it had started, it could \r\nhave been resolved peacefully precisely by respecting the Helsinki \r\nprinciples with the understanding that this might affect the political map \r\nof Europe. Such understanding would have prevented the damage, as well as the \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n12 \r\n(President Kucan) \r\nsimplifications and justifications that frequently attribute the crisis in the \r\nBalkans, and similar situations elsewhere, to irrational nationalist passion, \r\nnationalist animosities, tribalism and the like. \r\nSlovenia chose independence with its implementation of the right to \r\nself-determination. Slovenia proposed the peaceful dissolution of Yugoslavia \r\nin the manner advocated by Russia at the time of the dissolution of the Soviet \r\nUnion, when Russia supported the independence of all the republics of the \r\nformer Soviet Union. \r\nSlovenia does not oppose modern movements towards integration. It \r\nsupports them provided they are based, like the European Community, on respect \r\nfor the interests of all those involved, and on equal cooperation and \r\nagreement. Slovenia wishes to join the European Community and is prepared \r\nvoluntarily to surrender such parts of its sovereignty as all members of the \r\nEuropean Community must surrender. Slovenia does not wish this only because \r\nof its need for economic integration, but also because of its historical \r\naffiliation with that culture, which was interrupted by catastrophic \r\nideological, political and economic divisions after the Second World War. \r\nEnsuring durable international peace and security requires the fulfilment \r\nof certain conditions, among which respect for human rights is of critical \r\nsignificance. Those States that do not respect human dignity and human rights \r\nat home will not respect the dignity and sovereignty of other nations and \r\nother States. It is evident that threats to international peace very often \r\nstart with violations of human rights within the boundaries of countries which \r\nlater disturb the peace. \r\nThe Republic of Slovenia attaches great importance to concern for the \r\nimplementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms. As a new, sovereign \r\nState, it is strongly committed to the view that in our times State \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n. ,13* \r\n(President Kucan) \r\nsovereignty is primarily defined by criteria of the legitimacy of State \r\nauthority and respect for human rights. This is due above all to the \r\npractical importance of human rights as a guarantee of social stability and \r\npeace and thus as an important constituent of international peace and security. \r\nAt a time when the setting of international standards in the field of \r\nhuman rights is being completed, concern for the effectiveness of their \r\nimplementation and of international supervision is of high priority. \r\nExperience has shown that assuring respect for human rights, including \r\nespecially the rights of persons belonging to national, ethnic, religious and \r\nlinguistic minorities, is of critical importance for extinguishing crises and \r\nestablishing peace. Efforts at post-conflict peace-building will be \r\nprecarious and incomplete if that condition for stabilization is not fulfilled \r\nand supervised. The Secretary-General also fully stresses this in his \r\nimportant report \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277). \r\nThere is one further question which highlights the need to review the \r\nsuitability of institutional arrangements. This is the problem of refugees, \r\nas demonstrated in the war against Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is clear that \r\nan arrangement meeting the need to protect the personal status and integrity \r\nof an individual forced to abandon his country through fear of political and \r\nphysical violence is inadequate for a mass exodus of entire nations fleeing \r\nthreatened genocide as a result of a war of conquest and the \"ethnic \r\ncleansing\" of territory conquered by an aggressor. \r\nA million Muslim refugees from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina are \r\nwithout adequate protection and without an internationally guaranteed status. \r\nThey are ever more widely scattered throughout Europe. There are close to \r\n100,000 in my own country, which is, with great difficulty, providing them \r\nwith food and shelter. The Bosnian Muslims are becoming a nation without a \r\nA/47/PV. 11 \r\n14 \r\n(President Kucan) \r\nland, without a State, with all the attendant tragic consequences, including \r\nrepercussions for the protection of Europe against terrorism. It is of such \r\nhopelessness that terrorism is born. It is tragic that in this war against a \r\nState Member of the United Nations, composed of three nations, Croats, Muslims \r\nand Serbs, the Muslims should remain almost unprotected. That is why they \r\nseek refuge throughout Europe. \r\nAt a number of international conferences we have proposed that United \r\nNations peace-keeping forces create a safe haven in Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\nitself, where the relative safety of refugees would be assured, since, after \r\nthe war, when decisions are made on the fate of that State, the Muslims must \r\nbe present and active, physically and politically. The division of the State \r\nwould otherwise become a reality. It would also be a reality that aggression \r\nhad been rewarded by the allocation of conquered territory and that the world \r\nhad recognized the policy of fait accompli and shut its eyes to violations of \r\nthe principles of humanitarian rights, and to the perpetration of genocide. \r\nOf equal importance is an effective mechanism for prompt action in the \r\nresolution of humanitarian problems created by armed conflict. It is \r\nparticularly important that the humanitarian assistance - in which the High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees, Mrs. Sadako Ogata, the United Nations Children\u0027s \r\nFund (UNICEF) and its Executive Director, Mr. James Grant, and \r\nUnder-Secretary-General Jan Eliasson have invested so much effort - be \r\nprovided in a timely manner. The importance of humanitarian measures, even if \r\nthey require overcoming resistance and military protection, has been \r\ndemonstrated recently in some of the armed conflicts of the past year, \r\nincluding the conflicts in the Gulf and in the Balkans. Inability to \r\nguarantee humanitarian assistance is inexcusable and compromises the \r\ninternational community and, unfortunately, the United Nations. \r\nAV47/P*V.ll \r\n15 \r\n(President Kucan) \r\nIn a period of eased international relations and a search for new \r\norientations for development, there is an important way in which the potential \r\nrole of the United Nations has been extended: in preventive diplomacy and the \r\ncreation of measures which are a real contribution to defusing conflicts, \r\ndealing with their underlying causes and overcoming their consequences. \r\nPreventive diplomacy is a task for the future; it will require supplementing \r\nand reinforcing the work of the United Nations. It presupposes a knowledge of \r\nhistory and respect for the principles of the equality and self-determination \r\nof all peoples, and for other principles contained in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. In their own interests and in the common interest, the \r\nMembers of the United Nations will have to fulfill those principles. Only \r\nt \r\nthus will the authority of the United Nations be enhanced and protected, and \r\nthe hope which people, including the people of Slovenia, have invested in it \r\nbe justified. \r\nThe United Nations has alleviated, as far as it could, the negative \r\neffects of bloc rivalries and the bipolar division of the world. Now, the \r\nworld needs a United Nations which is capable of guiding, harmonizing and \r\nassisting change. This can be achieved only if the Organization can \r\nrevitalize, restructure and democratize its own system. We are firmly \r\nconvinced that the United Nations, as a universal forum of multilateralism, \r\nwill successfully take this unique opportunity to lay the foundations for a \r\nnew and more just world, in building which the entire international community \r\nshares a common interest. \r\nA/47/PV-.11 \r\n16 \r\n(President Kucan) \r\nI have devoted a great deal of attention to the crisis in the Balkans. I \r\nshould like, however, to stress that the Republic of Slovenia is also well \r\naware of other problems that beset the world, and that it has a constructive \r\napproach to the important aspects of an international world order that will \r\nnot be burdened by war, poverty, illiteracy, intolerance, and injustice; of an \r\norder in which the Declaration of the World Summit on Children and the \r\nachievements of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro will be implemented in \r\nfull; and of an order in which human rights will everywhere be the standard of \r\nbehaviour respected by States. Constructive and successful dialogue among \r\ndeveloped and developing countries - as well as peace, international security, \r\nand disarmament - are among our priority tasks. I wish the the United Nations \r\nevery success - success the world badly needs. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe President of the presidency of the Republic of Slovenia for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\nMr. Milan Kucan. President of the Presidency of the Republic of Slovenia-\r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued) \r\nGENERAL DEBATE \r\nADDRESS BY MR. JULES RATTANKOEMAR AJODHIA, VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC \r\nOF SURINAME \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear a statement by the \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Suriname. \r\nMr. Jules Rattankoemar Aiodhia. Vice-President of the Republic of \r\nSuriname. was escorted to the rostrum. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n17 \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have great pleasure in welcoming the \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Suriname, His Excellency \r\nMr. Jules Rattankoemar Ajodhia, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\nMr. AJODHIA (Suriname): The delegation of the Republic of Suriname \r\ncongratulates you most warmly. Sir, upon your election to the presidency of \r\nthe forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. You bring to that high \r\npost a wealth of experience and dedication, qualities that augur well for a \r\nsuccessful accomplishment of the task before us. \r\nAllow us to thank your predecessor. His Excellency Mr. Samir Shihabi, for \r\nthe excellent manner in which he guided the forty-sixth session of the General \r\nAssembly. We wish him well in his future endeavours. \r\nWe should like to welcome and congratulate the Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations on his assumption of that lofty and equally responsible \r\noffice. He has assumed the leadership of the Organization at a very difficult \r\nand crucial time marked by many political changes, a time at which greater \r\ninvolvement of the Organization in international affairs is demanded. We wish \r\nthe Secretary-General well and assure him of our fullest cooperation. \r\nI take this opportunity to welcome into the United Nations the newly \r\nindependent States of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Moldova, \r\nTajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Georgia. I should also like to \r\nwelcome San Marino, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Slovenia. \r\nAs reported to the General Assembly on previous occasions, for many years \r\nSuriname experienced a domestic armed struggle that brought sorrow and \r\nmourning to our people and restricted our possibilities for development. We \r\nnow wish to inform the Assembly that, through patient negotiations, our \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n18-20 \r\n(Mr. Aiodhia. Suriname) \r\nefforts have resulted in a recently signed agreement for national \r\nreconciliation and development. \r\nFrom the very beginning, my Government has attached the highest priority \r\nto achieving reconciliation in the country, for my Government wishes to \r\nrealize the full potential of the Surinamese people in harmony with their \r\naspirations for lasting democratic stability. Negotiations were started as \r\npart of our conviction that peace should gradually be forged, based on a \r\npolitical understanding of the various forces involved. Moreover, peace can \r\nonly be reached if negotiations are promoted and conducted in order to yield \r\nlasting results for the benefit of our people. \r\nWe called in the assistance of the Organization of American States, \r\nwhich, under the auspices of its Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Joao Clemente Baena Soares, provided support in the process of concluding \r\nthe agreement and in demobilization. Together with his worthy representative, \r\nwe have succeeded. Concrete results have been achieved, followed by the \r\nsigning of a substantial agreement based on the crucial need for \r\nreconstruction and development and which guarantees respect for human rights. \r\nToday, we rejoice that reconciliation in Suriname is concrete and \r\nfeasible. It has strengthened our determination to achieve national harmony \r\nand national development. We are confident that the Organization of American \r\nStates will render its valuable support in verifying compliance with the \r\nagreement, so as to ensure that the established peace-agreement will be \r\nobserved. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n21 \r\n(Mr. Aiodhia. Suriname) \r\nAs this body has been informed, in 1991 democracy was restored in my \r\ncountry, true to the will of the people. Yet, we must not lose sight of the \r\nfact that newly restored democracies such as ours are fragile, and depend to a \r\nconsiderable extent on international understanding and support. \r\nMy Government has since then made progress in establishing a degree of \r\nmuch-needed political stability, and can now concentrate on finding solutions \r\nto the current grave economic crisis, and the potential social crisis, \r\nconfronting my country. Our socio-economic problems, which have resulted in a \r\nsharp decline in production, increased unemployment, sharp price increases and \r\na deteriorating standard of living for the majority of the population, have \r\nnow compelled us to take serious corrective measures to halt the economic \r\ndecline and boost economic growth. Experiences throughout the world show that \r\nno government can successfully carry out a programme for economic \r\nreconstruction and development without the fullest national and international \r\nsupport. \r\nMy Government has decided to implement a programme for adjustment, \r\nrecovery and growth. In this context, we have secured valuable support from \r\nthe European Community. Furthermore, we can report to this Assembly that \r\ndevelopment cooperation with the Netherlands has been re-established, and that \r\nthe signing of the framework treaty for friendship and closer cooperation has \r\nadded a new dimension to bilateral relations between the Kingdom of the \r\nNetherlands and the Republic of Suriname. Thus, we are encouraged because our \r\nnational development strategy has found a ready response from the \r\ninternational community in this crucial aspect of our democratic process. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n22 \r\n(Mr. Aiodhia. Suriname) \r\nI can assure this Assembly, and with some emphasis, that in implementing \r\nthe adjustment programme our view is that a well-balanced and consistent \r\napproach to the social dimensions of the programme is indispensable to its \r\nfinal outcome. \r\nIn the past few years, forces of change have transformed the \r\ninternational political arena and profoundly changed the major balance of \r\npower that emerged from the Second World War. Antagonisms and hostility \r\nbetween the super-Powers have been replaced by unprecedented joint efforts and \r\npartnership. This has facilitated, through dialogue and by peaceful means, \r\nthe solution of a number of regional conflicts and the settlement of others. \r\nWe believe that the new political climate has had constructive effects in the \r\nworld, and has enabled us to define a broader and more fully integrated role \r\nin international security. \r\nThe international community is experiencing a rebirth of the United \r\nNations after 45 years of existence, for the fullest use is being made of its \r\npeacemaking and peace-keeping potential in order to bring about just and \r\nlasting peace in several parts of the world. As a result of the new mandate \r\nof this reinvigorated Organization, our hopes are being justified that it will \r\nnot be long before the unfolding dramas of human suffering, exploitation, \r\npoverty, fratricide, hunger and malnutrition, and aggressive nationalism will \r\nfinally be banished from the planet. \r\nOur Organization is facing the challenge and responsibility of bringing \r\nabout an overall and lasting settlement of various problems on the basis of \r\nrespect for the rights of all. It must encourage States to adhere to the \r\nCharter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant \r\ninstruments as the best means of protecting and promoting human rights. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n23 \r\n(Mr. Ajodhia. Suriname) \r\nWe support a just and lasting settlement in Central and Eastern Europe: \r\nwe are concerned about the growing tensions and conflicts in that region, \r\nwhich endanger international peace and security. We are keeping close track \r\nof developments in former Yugoslavia, and take^ this opportunity to welcome the \r\nefforts of our Organization, the London Conference and the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement summit. \r\nA just and lasting settlement is necessary on the African continent, we \r\nare deeply concerned by the threat from the growing instability in the Horn of \r\nAfrica caused by the conflict in Somalia. We express regret that, despite the \r\nsigning of a cease-fire agreement, the parties involved have not abided by \r\ntheir commitments and have thus not permitted the unimpeded distribution of \r\ni \r\nhumanitarian assistance to those in need. In this respect, my delegation has \r\nendorsed the proposal to convene a conference on the national reconciliation, \r\nreconstruction and unity of Somalia which should lead to a peaceful and \r\nlasting political settlement of the conflict. \r\nMy delegation strongly condemns the tragic escalation of violence in \r\nSouth Africa, which has halted the negotiating process within the framework of \r\nthe Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA). We strongly urge the \r\nSouth African regime to create a climate that is conducive to peaceful \r\nnegotiations aimed at an agreement on the text of a new constitution based on \r\na non-racial, democratic and united South Africa. \r\nAn overall and lasting settlement is needed for the Arab-Israeli conflict \r\nand the Palestine issue. My Government firmly supports the ongoing peace \r\nprocess, which is aimed at reaching a just, comprehensive and durable solution \r\nto the question of the Middle East. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n24-25 \r\n(Mr. Ajodhia. Suriname) \r\nWe welcome the progress made in reaching overall settlements of the \r\nconflicts in Asia, particularly in Cambodia and Afghanistan. The \r\nestablishment of the transitional Government in Afghanistan is a positive \r\ndevelopment towards peace, national reconciliation and reconstruction in that \r\ncountry. \r\nWe support the efforts of the Secretary-General to reach an agreement on \r\na set of fundamental principles with a view to reaching an overall agreement \r\non the question of Cyprus. With regard to Latin America and the Caribbean, we \r\nare pleased to note that the processes of democratization, harmonization, \r\nreconciliation and economic integration are gradually bearing fruit. \r\nThe agreements between the Government of El Salvador and the Farabundo \r\nMarti National Liberation Front mark the closing of a decade of fratricidal \r\nwar. They will undoubtedly contribute to lasting peace and stability, which \r\nare imperative for the region\u0027s development. \r\nWe express full support for the struggle of the people of Haiti to \r\nrestore democracy and respect for human rights in their country, and for the \r\nefforts of the Organization of American States towards this end. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n26 \r\n(Mr. Aiodhia. Suriname) \r\nAs we advance in the decade of the \u002790s, the economic and social problems \r\nof developing countries continue to be manifold. Difficult decisions will \r\ntherefore be needed to address the issue of international economic adjustment \r\nand development in order to eliminate the imbalances between the North and the \r\nSouth. \r\nThe worsening of the economic situation and social conditions in many \r\ndeveloping countries has led to a decline in the standard of living and to the \r\npersistence and increase of widespread poverty. The elimination of hunger and \r\nmalnutrition, the improvement of health standards and the eradication of \r\nilliteracy should be issues of paramount concern in the coming decades. My \r\ndelegation therefore holds the view that these aims can best be achieved by \r\nputting into motion a people-centered development process. \r\nIt is in this context that my delegation warmly supports the convening of \r\na Summit for Social Development in order to enable the international community \r\nto deal extensively with the complex but most important question of human \r\ndevelopment. \r\nThough no substantive commitment to new funds was made during the \r\nrecently held Rio Conference on Environment and Development, it should be \r\nnoted as an important achievement of the international community that a \r\nprogramme of action. Agenda 21, and the Rio Declaration have been adopted. \r\nThe Rio Conference has clearly established the close link between environment, \r\ngrowth and development, the primary issues for the international community. \r\nIt is as a consequence of the results of the Rio summit that during the \r\ncurrent General Assembly special attention must be paid to institutional \r\nfollow-up of the Rio Conference. In this regard, we attach great importance \r\nto the establishment of the Commission on Sustainable Development. This \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n27 \r\n(Mr. Aiodhia. Suriname) \r\nCommission must of necessity become the primary and most important forum for \r\nconsultation and must set the trend for measures to implement Agenda 21 at \r\nnational, regional and global levels. \r\nOnce again I should like to emphasize that in the new international \r\nenvironment the role and function of the United Nations has become universally \r\naccepted. We have witnessed an increased interest in multilateralism and a \r\nrenewal of the relevance of the United Nations and its main bodies. The \r\npeacemaking and peace-keeping activities of this world Organization in many \r\nregions have, more than at any time in the past, opened prospects for its \r\ngreatly enhanced role in the maintenance of world peace and security. These \r\nactivities have proved to be effective procedures, well-suited to present-day \r\nrealities. \r\nThe opportunities offered by the Charter in the fields of preventive \r\ndiplomacy, fact-finding and good-offices missions should be optimally \r\nexplored, so as to provide the Secretary-General with a suitable structure for \r\nthe prevention and timely management of crises and conflicts. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe Vice-President of the Republic of Suriname for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\nMr. Jules Rattankoemar Ajodhia. Vice-President of the Republic of \r\nSuriname. was escorted from the rostrum. \r\nSheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem AL-SABAH (Kuwait) (interpretation from \r\nArabic): On behalf of the delegation of the State of Kuwait, I wish to \r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the \r\nforty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your election. \r\nSir, reflects an appreciation of your country, Bulgaria, and your personal \r\nmerits and skills, which will prove instrumental in guiding our deliberations \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n28 \r\n(Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem \r\nAl-Sabah. Kuwait) \r\ntowards the attainment of our common goals. On a bilateral note, it is my \r\nprivilege to underscore the close ties that exist between our two countries, \r\nas shown in numerous concrete steps. \r\nIn your current post, you succeed His Excellency \r\nAmbassador Samir Shihabi, the Permanent Representative of our sister country, \r\nthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, who demonstrated outstanding skills and \r\ncapabilities in his stewardship of the preceding session. His leadership was \r\neffective indeed throughout his term of office. This was no surprise to us, \r\nespecially as Mr. Shihabi represented a sister country, the Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia, which has made and continues to make generous and sincere \r\ncontributions, that are appreciated by all, to the promotion of peace and \r\nsecurity throughout the world. \r\nIt gives me special pleasure to commend the outstanding role played by \r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations, His Excellency \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, since his assumption of his office at the beginning \r\nof this year. The world Organization has now become the true focal point of \r\ninternational relations and the beacon of hope for the peoples of the world. \r\nIn less than one year in office, the Secretary-General has demonstrated \r\nan impressive ability to face up to the evolving challenges on the world \r\nscene, and has managed to address the varying concerns in accordance with the \r\nestablished principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the overall \r\nmission of our organization. The Secretary-General\u0027s endeavour to redefine \r\nthe role, function and orientation of the United Nations is characterized by \r\nprecise thinking and clear vision, resolve and flexibility, both in concept \r\nand in enforcement plan, as demonstrated by the set of important \r\nrecommendations contained in his report \"An Agenda for Peace\". \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n29-30 \r\n(Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem \r\nAl-Sabah. Kuwait) \r\nIn his approach, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has proved that he truly \r\nrepresents a symbol of the interface and interaction of various human \r\ncivilizations, a role that his home country, Egypt, has played throughout its \r\nlong history. \r\nIn the same vein, we should not fail to underscore with a deep sense of \r\nappreciation the great achievements of the former Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, during his tenure. Mr. Perez de Cuellar should \r\nbe recognized for his integrity in fulfilling his mandate in accordance with \r\nthe provisions of the Charter and for his untiring efforts to promote peace on \r\nthe basis of justice and to enhance the role and effectiveness of the United \r\nNations. Kuwait recognizes with deep appreciation those achievements, salutes \r\nMr. Perez de Cuellar and wishes him success in all he does. \r\nThe international scene has undergone fundamental changes over the past \r\ntwo years, the most significant of which has been the disintegration of the \r\nSoviet Union and the spread of democratic orientation across Eastern Europe. \r\nThat, in turn has led to the creation of States and entities that have joined \r\nthe United Nations membership, thus consolidating further its universality. \r\nKuwait takes this opportunity to extend its sincere congratulations to all \r\nthose States that have been admitted recently to the United Nations \r\nmembership. We trust that this new membership of the international community \r\nwill represent a constructive addition to and consolidation of the edifice of \r\nworld peace. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n31 \r\n(Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem \r\nAl-Sabah. Kuwait) \r\nAs we draw nearer to the twenty-first century, we look forward to the \r\nemergence of new roles for the United Nations. The United Nations should not \r\nbe content with peace-keeping, the ending wars that have broken out, and the \r\ndefusing of volatile situations. Rather, the United Nations must make a more \r\ndirect contribution to the containment and defusing of disputes in their early \r\nstages before they erupt into vicious conflicts. It must also shoulder the \r\nrole of peacemaking. \r\nThe United Nations should not be content with ensuring stability, despite \r\nthe vital importance of that role. It must be a force for ensuring peoples\u0027 \r\nwelfare and the fulfilment of peoples\u0027 aspirations. In today\u0027s world, the \r\nconcept of peace transcends the framework of peace between states and embraces \r\nthe peace of whole societies and peoples. \r\nAs we work together on the formulation of the new world order and strive \r\nto make it one of the principal stanchions of the stability which we hope will \r\nreign in our world and imbue international relations, we are called upon to \r\nensure the rule of international law through the strengthening of the United \r\nNations role and the scrupulous application of its Charter. In our view, this \r\nwill provide a genuine framework for the new world order and for the \r\nachievement of its lofty goals. \r\nDespite the fact that international relations in our world today are \r\nanchored in the tenets of the United Nations system, we believe that an \r\neffective and viable United Nations should be complemented by a more \r\naggressive role for the regional organizations which would be instrumental in \r\naddressing many unresolved disputes and issues. The League of Arab States and \r\nthe Organization of African Unity, for example, should be entrusted with \r\nsupporting roles in dealing with the problems of Somalia; the European \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n32 \r\n(Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem \r\nAl-Sabah. Kuwait) \r\nCommunity should play the leading role in the resolution of the escalating \r\nproblems in the Balkan region; and the Organization of American States can \r\nbecome the leading player in dealing with the problems of Haiti and \r\nEl Salvador. \r\nIn the context of this desired role for regional organizations the \r\nCooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) stands out, \r\nespecially through its firm support of Kuwait\u0027s struggle to defeat the Iraqi \r\naggression. That unprecedented role of the GCC could perhaps be followed as a \r\nmodel in rallying a larger international effort when necessary. \r\nKuwait believes that the Non-Aligned Movement, especially in the wake of \r\nits recent summit in Jakarta, and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, \r\nas well as the Group of 77, are models of regional organizations whose \r\ncapabilities should be directed at facilitating the evolution and maintenance \r\nof world peace. In this sense, they are natural mini-counterparts of the \r\nUnited Nations, and they represent major dynamic forces that perform a \r\ncoordinating function among their members. \r\nFrom this perspective we believe that the efforts undertaken by the \r\nUnited Nations in the liberation of my country, Kuwait, from the Iraqi \r\naggression and occupation could perhaps be perceived as a new approach in the \r\ncrystallization and enforcement of the concept of collective security, which \r\npreoccupied this world body since its inception, and was a hope in the minds \r\nof the authors of its Charter. Thus, the Kuwait case established a precedent \r\nwhen it demonstrated that the Security Council\u0027s resolutions can be \r\nimplemented, as, indeed, they must be implemented. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n33 \r\n(Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem \r\nAl-Sabah. Kuwait) \r\nThe Security Council has clearly succeeded in consolidating the \r\nunderpinnings of peace and the elimination of many hotbeds of conflict in \r\nseveral regions of the world, in the aftermath of its successful moves to \r\nensure the liberation of my country, Kuwait, from an invasion which, by its \r\nvery nature, represented a challenge to the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nto the norms of international law that regulate relations between civilized \r\nnations. \r\nHowever, certain residual results of the Iraqi aggression still exist, \r\nand will continue to exist so long as the Iraqi regime persists in its refusal \r\nto comply fully with the relevant Security Council resolutions and tries to \r\ncircumvent those resolutions and to renege on its previous formal \r\ncommitments. For instance, there are still Kuwaiti and third country \r\nprisoners held hostage in Iraqi jails despite the intensive efforts and \r\ninternational pressures deployed to secure their release. \r\nFurthermore, the patently false claims repeatedly made by Iraq, in \r\ncontravention of international treaties and commitments, continue to shake the \r\nparameters of stability throughout the region. Iraqi falsehoods also \r\njeopardize the main objective of the input of the United Nations in providing \r\nthe technical framework for the Iraq-Kuwait boundary demarcation process. \r\nThis exercise is a major achievement on the part of the United Nations in \r\nregard to security and stability in the region. The Security Council\u0027s \r\nrecently adopted resolution 773 (1992) welcomed the decisions of the United \r\nNations Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission and underlined the \r\nCouncil\u0027s guarantee of inviolability of the international border between the \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n34 \r\n(Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem \r\nAl-Sabah. Kuwait) \r\ntwo countries and its decision to take, as appropriate, all necessary measures \r\nto that end, in accordance with the Charter. \r\nFurthermore, Iraq continues to refuse to accept legal responsibility for \r\nits plundering of property owned by the Kuwaiti private sector and by Kuwaiti \r\nindividuals, and continues to refuse to recognize the need to return all \r\nstolen property. Iraq also refuses to implement Security Council resolutions \r\n706 (1991) and 712 (1991) regarding the provision of essential humanitarisn \r\nneeds for the Iraqi civilian population and the payment of its dues to the \r\nUnited Nations compensation fund. In addition, Iraq, under all pretexts, \r\nshies away from any businesslike cooperation in regard to the fulfilment of \r\nits obligation to disclose all its stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction \r\nand in regard to the elimination of such weapons. \r\nAll of this places a new responsibility on the international community in \r\ngeneral to bring further pressure to bear on Iraq, to remain vigilant to its \r\npractices and schemes, and to ensure its complete implemention of all the \r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions. The principle of collective \r\nresponsibility still stands, and the lessons drawn from that painful and \r\nbitter experience should be fully understood and never forgotten. \r\nKuwait believes that security in the Gulf region is part and parcel of \r\nworld security. This means that it is essential that all of us respect the \r\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all the States in our \r\nregion. It also means non-interference in the internal affairs of those \r\nStates, as well as the non-use of force or of the threat of force in the \r\nsettlement of any dispute that may arise between them. \r\nFrom this premise, we have been following with grave concern the recent \r\ndevelopments, with all their remifications, in regard to the Abu Mousa island. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n35 \r\n(Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem \r\nAl-Sabah. Kuwait) \r\nIn our view, these developments will have a direct impact on regional peace \r\nand stability. Hence, we are all duty-bound to work towards averting their \r\nrepercussions so that the good-neighbourly relations that we already have with \r\nthe friendly Islamic Republic of Iran may be preserved. While we declare our \r\nfull support for our sister State of the United Arab Emirates, we hope that \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran will abide by the agreement regarding the island \r\nof Abu Mousa and will accept the application of international conventions for \r\nthe peaceful resolution of disputes. We trust that, in the final analysis, \r\nprudence and wisdom will reign supreme in regard to this issue. \r\nAs of late last year, we have seen a promising peace process under way in \r\nregard to the Middle East problem. The new realities and momentum that \r\nemerged following the Madrid conference should be maintained, with a view to \r\nsecuring the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and \r\n338 (1973) on the basis of the exchange of land for peace. \r\nIt has become clear that land and peace are worth any price. The \r\ninternational community has thus a special responsibility to nurture the \r\nongoing peace efforts and to ensure that the current peace talks, in all their \r\naspects and forms, will bring to fruition the efforts that the United Nations \r\nhas made with a view to guaranteeing the national rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople particularly its right to self-determination and statehood - and the \r\ncomplete withdrawal of Israel from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the holy \r\ncity of Al-Quds. We call upon the United Nations to prompt Israel to abide \r\nexpeditiously with its obligations under international law and not to squander \r\nthis historic opportunity. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n35(a-z) \r\n(Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem \r\nAl-Sabah. Kuwait) \r\nThe peace process and the attendant efforts should follow an integrated \r\napproach in addressing the Arab-Israeli conflict that takes into account the \r\nUnited Nations resolutions regarding the question of Palestine and the Middle \r\nEast issue. In specific terms, this means that Israel must withdraw from \r\nsouthern Lebanon in accordance with Security Council resolution 425 (1978), \r\nand that the Lebanese people must be supported in consolidating their \r\nnational-reconciliation efforts and in rebuilding their national institutions. \r\nIt also means Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Arab Golan and the \r\nimplementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions in order that a just \r\nand lasting settlement of this long-running conflict may be reached. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n36 \r\n(Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem \r\nAl-Sabah. Kuwait) \r\nThe ongoing plight of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina gives rise to \r\ndeep fears and apprehensions throughout the Islamic world and in the world at \r\nlarge. We categorically reject all practices that aim at the liquidation of \r\nthe identity and existence of a people, a nation and a State on ethnic or \r\nreligious grounds. We support the struggle of the people of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina and demand the implementation of the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions. We call upon the United Nations, along with its specialized \r\nagencies, to expand its role there, and we hold that regional organizations, \r\nparticularly the European ones, should play a more active role in alleviating \r\nthe suffering of that people. It is our collective responsibility to contain \r\nthe ramifications of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina before they spill \r\nover into neighbouring countries. \r\nIf the United Nations has been seized of this tragic issue since the very \r\nbeginning, then we believe that there are other turbulent areas in the world \r\nthat deserve active involvement on the part of the United Nations together \r\nwith the competent regional organizations, with a view to containing and \r\nresolving the disputes afflicting those regions. In our view, this is a sound \r\napproach to underlining and enhancing the credibility of the United Nations \r\nand to defining clearly the parameters of the new world order. We are \r\nduty-bound to support both the United Nations and the regional organizations \r\nin a concrete fashion that gives real meaning to the concept of common \r\nsecurity and stability and the principle of common destiny. \r\nThe tragedy of the Somali people is cause for deep concern on our part, \r\ngiven the common values we share with them. The fratricidal strife in Somalia \r\nis extremely painful to us. Despite the slight improvement over the past few \r\nweeks in the delivery of food and medical supplies and in the control over the \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n37 \r\n(Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem \r\nAl-Sabah. Kuwait) \r\ndistribution thereof, Somalia continues to bleed, and it has now become \r\nincumbent upon all nations to provide more material assistance to Somalia and \r\nto strengthen their support for the Secretary-General in his endeavours to \r\nexpedite the attainment of a set of noble goals, namely, the protection of an \r\nentire people from annihilation and the delivery of adequate supplies of food \r\nand medical services to that people. \r\nWe in Kuwait, in view of our solidarity with the friendly peoples of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia and in line with our humanitarian \r\nobligations and our commitment to alleviate human suffering, have shipped \r\nthousands of tons of food, medical supplies and basic human needs to those two \r\ncountries. Furthermore, we have made direct financial contributions to the \r\nrelevant specialized agencies in order to ensure their ability to operate in \r\nthose areas. We shall continue to provide humanitarian relief assistance out \r\nof our deep belief in social justice. \r\nWe follow with deep concern the persistent instability in Afghanistan and \r\nthe continuing strife among the partners in the coalition Government. We call \r\nupon the Muslim people of Afghanistan to put aside their differences and to \r\nmove towards national reconciliation. National efforts should in fact focus \r\non building up national stability and security. \r\nAny political breakthroughs made by the United Nations will add to its \r\ngrowing record of achievements. But such accomplishments will remain fragile \r\nunless followed by more efforts to promote social stability and economic \r\ndevelopment, with particular emphasis on health, social services and combating \r\nills of epidemic proportions, especially drug abuse. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n38 \r\n(Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem \r\nAl-Sabah. Kuwait) \r\nMoreover, the United Nations should explore new avenues to ease the \r\nforeign debt burden on the developing countries and to try to bridge the gap \r\nbetween wealthy and poor nations by means of a more earnest and constructive \r\ndialogue between North and South, with a. view to ensuring economic equity \r\nanchored in social justice. One of the aims of such dialogue should be \r\nconfidence-building between donor and recipient nations. Such confidence will \r\nlead to joint efforts in a bid to stimulate the inflow of investments with a \r\nbetter economic and social return for both sides. This will indeed be yet \r\nanother manifestation of an interdependent world community of nations. \r\nIt is against this conceptual backdrop that we view the outcome of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), known as the \r\n\"Earth Summit\", held recently in Rio de Janiero. The focus of the Rio \r\nConference brought to the fore the growing world-wide interest in gaining a \r\nbetter understanding of the political, economic, and social aspects of human \r\nlife. Despite the fact that the UNCED did not achieve all its expected goals, \r\none of its major contributions was that it highlighted for the whole world, in \r\nan unprecedented manner, the importance of the issue of environment and made \r\nit abundantly clear that ecological concerns do indeed transcend both national \r\nand regional disputes. It has deepened our sense of belonging to a single \r\n\"global village\". \r\nThe current changes and new challenges on the international scene are \r\nbound to cause dramatic transformations in many established concepts and \r\nassumptions that still dominate international relations. A case in point is \r\nthe growing interest in the issue of human rights. In an evolving world, not \r\nonly should human rights be defined in instruments but the concept of human \r\nrights should be expanded to include the genuine guarantee of the exercise of \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n39 \r\n(Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem \r\nAl-Sabah. Kuwait) \r\nthose rights to freedoms and human dignity, in addition to the satisfaction of \r\nbasic human needs and the liberation of man from fear and want. Guaranteeing \r\nhuman rights has become a major demand of today\u0027s world and the international \r\ncommunity continues to make it clear, time and again, that it will not condone \r\nany breech or violation thereof. Respect for State sovereignty should be in \r\nconsonance with the guaranteeing of human rights. \r\nIn conclusion, we note that the recent radical, international changes \r\nhave placed before the United Nations enormous challenges and \r\nresponsibilities. The growing confidence in its role and in the need for it \r\nto perform its functions make it imperative for all of us to reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to the world Organization. It would be both unfair and \r\ninappropriate for us to keep adding to its responsibilities without providing \r\nit with sufficient material and political support to enable it to fulfil its \r\nmandates effectively. This means that the international community should put \r\nat the United Nations disposal adequate resources and powers, commensurate \r\nwith its responsibilities. \r\nThe Secretary-General has shown that while the United Nations is prepared \r\nto discharge its functions, the Member States are in turn expected to honour \r\ntheir obligations in full. This complementarity between the United Nations \r\nsystem and its Members will straighten out the relationship between mandates \r\nand resources. Thus we can eliminate the imbalance between what is required \r\nand what is available and the potential causes of friction that go with that \r\ndisequilibrium. Under such circumstances, the world body would be able to \r\nlive up to the expectations of the international community in the areas of \r\npeacemaking and peace-keeping, along with all the attendant profits in terms \r\nof stability, security, development, progress and welfare. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n40 \r\nMr. CLAES (Belgium) (interpretation from French): Allow me first of \r\nall to congratulate you warmly. Sir, on your election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Through your person, an entire region of the world affirms \r\nin this forum its political renewal. \r\nThe body of Members of our Organization is growing continually. Over the \r\nlast year, 21 new States have come to join our ranks and have subscribed to \r\nthe commitments of the Charter. We bid them welcome. Belgium has always held \r\nthe view that our Organization should be open to all States. Equally strong, \r\nhowever, is our conviction that expansion should not come to mean shattering \r\nand dispersal. National aspirations must remain subordinate to the essential \r\nprerequisites of multilateral cooperation, which is becoming more necessary \r\nevery day. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n41 \r\n(Mr. Claes. Belgium) \r\nIn this respect, the confidence Belgium placed in the new \r\nSecretary-General even before his election has turned out to be fully \r\njustified. As proof of this, I would refer to his actions in the former \r\nYugoslavia and in Somalia. I have also in mind his analyses at the Rio \r\nConference, his report on preventive diplomacy and his report to the General \r\nAssembly. \r\nMy colleague, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom, has \r\nalready spoken on behalf of the member States of the European Community. This \r\nallows me to concentrate my statement on a few issues of particular concern to \r\nus. \r\nThe end of the cold war made strengthened international cooperation both \r\npossible and necessary. For combined reasons of history, size and \r\ngeographical location, Belgium has always been predisposed to cooperation. \r\nWithout a credible international order, we will all sooner or later be faced \r\nwith an upsurge of unilateral demands containing the seeds of inevitable \r\nthreats to peace. Our membership of the Security Council has enabled us to \r\nwitness this first hand. A United Nations which functions effectively \r\nconstitutes the best guarantee against such dangers. \r\nThe end of the cold war has produced a variety of results. A wall has \r\nfallen but new trenches have been dug. The elimination of global ideological \r\nconfrontation has led to the easing of regional conflicts that were fuelled by \r\nthat confrontation. But it has also released frustrations, which have often \r\ndegenerated into parodies of the right to self-determination and into new \r\nconflicts. We must react to this. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Claes. Belgium) \r\nFortunately, the United Nations is no longer paralysed by the automatic \r\nideological antagonisms of the past. The Security Council in particular has \r\nregained its means of action and its authority, which is now broadly \r\nrecognized. Failure to comply with its decisions now equals isolation from \r\nthe international community. \r\nBut precisely because our Organization is experiencing something of a \r\nrevival, we have to ensure that it does not fall victim to its own success. \r\nThe summit meeting of the Security Council members, held last January, \r\nrecognized the extent of this challenge. The Heads of State or Government \r\nrequested the Secretary-General to develop concrete proposals to respond to \r\nit. \r\nThe Secretary General\u0027s report, \"An Agenda for Peace\", has given us ample \r\nfood for thought on the future role of the Organization. The report confirms \r\nthat our central objective should be peace first and foremost, for without \r\npeace, neither normal society nor faith in the future of individuals is \r\npossible. \r\nThe General Assembly will debate preventive diplomacy in depth. We hold \r\nthis concept to be based on the following elements: full use of the powers \r\nvested in the Secretary-General; a United Nations presence in the initial \r\nstages of a potential conflict; the specific role of regional organizations; \r\ncommissions of inquiry and temporary observer missions; an enlarged role for \r\nUnited Nations staff already present in potential conflict zones; and \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. \r\nDisarmament and non-proliferation continue to merit special attention in \r\ntheir own right. The end of the cold war has made the control and monitoring \r\nof conventional weapons more difficult. The nightmare of global nuclear \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n43 \r\n(Mr. Claes. Belgium) \r\nconfrontation has given way to the threat of the unchecked proliferation and \r\ndissemination of nuclear arms and technology. During the forty-sixth session \r\nof the General Assembly, the 12 countries of the European Community, together \r\nwith Japan, took an initiative which has led to the creation of a register for \r\nmultilateral control of the transfer of conventional weapons. That, however, \r\nis but a first step. \r\nThe case of Iraq has demonstrated the extent of the problems caused by a \r\nlack of transparency in commercial transactions involving both conventional \r\nand nuclear weaponry. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should \r\ntherefore continue to improve its system of safeguards, preventive detection \r\nand monitoring of the transfer of dual-use items. \r\nI would like to pay a tribute here to the steadfast efforts of the \r\nConference on Disarmament. Belgium currently chairs that Conference and will \r\npresent to the General Assembly the draft Convention on a ban on \r\nchemical-weapons. On behalf of a country victimized by these weapons during \r\nthe First World War, I want to launch a solemn appeal in favour of the \r\nuniversal acceptance of the draft Convention, resulting in the final \r\nelimination of these particularly barbaric weapons from all arsenals.* \r\nA more systematic use of preventive diplomacy would, no doubt, enable us \r\nto limit at least the human cost of conflicts. However, it is clear that when \r\nprevention reaches its limits, the Organization must be able to resort to \r\nother peace-keeping measures. \r\nMr. Moumin (Comoros), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n44 \r\n(Mr. Claes. Belgium) \r\nIn response to the appeals of the Secretary-General, Belgium, for its \r\npart, has dispatched a battalion to Croatia and units to Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, and is preparing a battalion for deployment in Somalia. \r\nThe financial difficulties of our Organization have led us recently to \r\nseek alternative financing systems. However, I must take this opportunity to \r\nrecall the obligation of solidarity that applies to all Member States. All \r\nMembers must fulfil their budgetary obligations. The system for financing \r\npeace-keeping operations should be uniform and predictable, and should resolve \r\nthe problems of financing the initial phases of urgent operations. The United \r\nNations would obviously lose both operational capacity and credibility if the \r\nOrganization were denied the budgetary resources corresponding to its \r\nresponsibilities. \r\nHowever, all the combined tools of preventive diplomacy, disarmament, \r\nnon-proliferation and peace-keeping operations are not sufficient to ensure \r\nreal peace. Most conflicts are more deeply rooted. I wholeheartedly agree \r\nwith the Secretary-General\u0027s broad interpretation of the elements which \r\ncontribute to ensuring peace. Like him, I believe that the role of the \r\nOrganization extends to the prevention of tensions of any kind, be they \r\neconomic disparities, infringements of human rights, the absence of democracy \r\nor environmental degradation. \r\nFor the first generations of the post-colonial era, the term \"North-South \r\ndialogue\" kept alive the hope of attaining a more equitable distribution of \r\nwealth and opportunities. The situation today is far from meeting those \r\nexpectations. This is the combined result of the cold war and military \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n45 \r\n(Mr. Claes. Belgium) \r\nexpenditure, of a degree of selfishness in the North, of corruption and bad \r\ngovernance, and of a wrong choice of priorities both in the South and the \r\nNorth. \r\nFor these reasons, major bilateral and multilateral aid efforts have \r\nsometimes failed and have also maintained a culture of dependency which now \r\ndemands a process of emancipation. The contrasts between North and South \r\ndemand our attention more than ever. We are witnessing, on the one hand, a \r\nrace to satisfy material cravings, and on the other, abject poverty. This is \r\nthe greatest challenge facing us. We not only have to maintain important \r\nresource and technology transfers, but we also need to make a frank analysis \r\nof past errors and to identify the real priorities. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n46 \r\n(Mr. Claes. Belgium) \r\nIn this context two factors have, in my view, become of key importance: \r\nfirst, the concept of global interdependence and, secondly, the growing \r\nemphasis on the close links between population, environment and development. \r\nUseful lessons may be drawn from past disappointments concerning \r\ndonor-recipient relationships. The Assembly will also discuss the triennial \r\npolicy review of the operational acitivities of the United Nations system. We \r\nhope that this will be a thorough debate leading to a genuine reassessment of \r\nmultilateral aid mechanisms. \r\nFor our part, we have launched a number of innovations in our bilateral \r\naid during recent years. These include, in particular, the creation of joint \r\nmanagement systems for our development projects, designed to reinforce the \r\ndecision-making capacity of our partners. \r\nNevertheless, a real economic take-off will be possible only if \r\ninvestments follow government efforts. We note with satisfaction that a \r\nnumber of developing countries have taken steps to offer greater legal \r\nsecurity to foreign investors with respect to freedom of enterprise, fiscal \r\nmatters and mobility of capital and profits. Such measures contribute to the \r\ncreation of a beter investment climate. \r\nWe have to concern ourselves now more than ever with the social aspects \r\nof development. Profit is not a goal in itself. Income redistribution must \r\nallow for the full personal development of every individual within a society \r\nbased on solidarity. This solidarity must extend to future generations. The \r\nrights of workers, as well as their families, their cultural heritage and \r\ntheir environment, must therefore be protected. The World Conference on \r\nSocial Development, to be held in 1995, will provide us an opportunity to give \r\nthese goals and principles the high priority they deserve. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Claes. Belgium) \r\nInternational economic cooperation can flourish only on the basis of \r\npolitical will and effective mechanisms. This explains the vital importance \r\nof several international negotiating processes, either in progress or already \r\nbeing finalized, being brought to a successful conclusion. \r\nI should like to stress Belgium\u0027s attachment to the liberalization of \r\nworld trade as a driving force for economic growth and development. The \r\nsuccess of the Uruguay Round is the essential precondition for this. \r\nFinally, the Rio de Janeiro Conference was a milestone in the process of \r\nincreasing collective awareness of the future of our planet, and Belgium will \r\nattach the greatest importance to its follow-up. One of the crucial aspects \r\nhere concerns the financial mechanisms. We earnestly wish for a strengthening \r\nof the structure of the global environment facility to adapt it better to the \r\nvarious needs. This should also contribute to a greater convergence between \r\nthe international financial institutions of the Bretton Woods system and the \r\noperational mechanisms of the United Nations family. \r\nI could not possibly close this part of my statement without mentioning \r\nthe economic problems of a region to which we feel particularly close, namely \r\nAfrica. Current events are continually giving us cause for concern. Belgium, \r\nhowever, refuses to give in to visions of catastrophe or what a fashionable \r\nphrase defines as \"Afro-pessimism\". \r\nIn recent years Belgium has redefined its attitude and its commitments \r\ntowards Africa, first in areas where we could have to assume special \r\nresponsibilities. We warmly welcome the fact that the link between democracy, \r\nhuman rights and development is now widely recognized and applied. We hope \r\nthat democratization will be understood at its true value, namely, for the \r\nbenefit of the people. The spirit which inspires us is not that of a new \r\npaternalism: we wish to enter into cooperation as equal partners. In order \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n48 \r\n(Mr. Claes. Belgium) \r\nto support political renewal in Africa, my Government has just created a fund \r\nto assist in the financing of democratic elections, the main beneficiary of \r\nwhich will be the African continent. Furthermore, Belgium is actively using \r\nits influence with its partners and in relevant international institutions to \r\nensure that the dawning of democracy is accompanied by an upturn in economic \r\nactivity. In the meantime, we have intensified our emergency aid in several \r\nareas affected by conflict or natural diasters. My Government also welcomes \r\nthe fact that, as regards aid to Africa, it has established a fruitful working \r\nrelationship with Belgian and international non-governmental organizations. \r\nFailure to respect the rights of the individual is another source of \r\ntension and violence, as well as an impediment to economic and social progress. \r\nWe must clearly reaffirm the principle of the universality of basic \r\nrights and freedoms which are inherent in human dignity. These rights cannot \r\nbe subject to various intepretations. \r\nRespect for and the protection of human rights require stronger \r\nmonitoring mechanisms. An extraordinary session of the Human Rights \r\nCommission took place last month in Geneva. The Commission strongly condemned \r\nthe serious and intolerable human rights abuses taking places in the former \r\nYugoslavia. Belgium warmly welcomes this rapid reaction and \r\nwould like to see it serve as an example in the future. \r\nBelgium would also like to see the coming World Conference on Human \r\nRights lead to a reaffirmation of the international commitments by States and \r\na strengthening of cooperation in the world community. We appeal to all \r\ncountries to strive in a constructive spirit for the success of this \r\nConference. \r\nWe are already in favour of a role for the Security Council in certain \r\ncases of particularly flagrant or large-scale violations of human rights. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n49-50 \r\n(Mr. Claes. Belgium) \r\nThis is why Belgium insisted on having the Council hear Mr. van der Stoel on \r\nthe human rights situation in Iraq. \r\nThis is a delicate subject, as we are well aware. But international law \r\nis evolving, and since information has virtually lost its borders, frontiers \r\nare fading for injustice as well. Ultimately, States simply have to respect \r\nthe international comitments they have undertaken as sovereign Powers. \r\nThe unbreakable link between democracy and respect for human rights is \r\nalso put in concrete terms in the United Nations system through the question \r\nof electoral assistance. Numerous requests for such assistance are currently \r\nbeing addressed to the Secretariat. In order to give an adequate response, \r\nprecise standards must be established. The existing mechanisms which allow \r\nfor some forms of electoral asssistance must be fully used. This session of \r\nthe General Assembly should enable us to clarify matters where necessary. \r\nThe growing number of ethnic conflicts poses a special problem, half-way \r\nbetween the traditional questions of human rights and the exercise of the \r\nright to self-determination. Consequently, the protection of ethnic \r\nminorities deserves special attention at this time. \r\nIn Europe, we continue to believe, in spite of recent disappointments, \r\nthat the rules developed by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope (CSCE) remain valid. The right to self-determination must in no case \r\nbe put forward to justify excesses and cruelties committed in its name. \r\nBesides, the protection of minorities should not necessarily or indeed \r\nexclusively be placed under the banner of self-determination. I wish to \r\nrepeat what I said in the early part of my statement - for this seems to me to \r\nbe a fundamental truth: excessive invocation of the principle of \r\nself-determination leads straight to a caricature of national sovereignty. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. Claes. Belgium) \r\nIt is necessary therefore to explore viable alternatives: real \r\nadministrative decentralization, cultural autonomy, federal or confederate \r\nsystems. The claims of minorities are above all the collective expression of \r\na specific dignity and of human rights which cannot be trodden underfoot or \r\nignored. Once this truth has been admitted, approaches more conciliatory than \r\nblind nationalism become possible. This is my hope for the future of the \r\nminorities issue. \r\nThe current world situation has prompted me to concentrate my reflections \r\naround the role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity, in the fight against underdevelopment and in the protection of human \r\nrights. In none of these fields can we hope to achieve lasting improvements \r\nwithout strengthened regional cooperation. \r\nAs we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the United \r\nNations Charter, in a world very different from the one its authors knew, the \r\nneed for complementarity between the regional and global spheres has become \r\nobvious. We must work to define its modalities. At a time when Belgium is \r\nclose to the end of its term of membership in the Security Council, I am \r\npleased to note that this debate is taking place above all as regards the \r\nestablishment and maintenance of peace.* \r\nThe President returned to the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n52 \r\nADDRESS BY MR. JAMES BRENDAN BOLGER, PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of New Zealand. \r\nMr. James Brendan Bolger. Prime Minister of New Zealand, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have great pleasure in welcoming the Prime \r\nMinister of New Zealand, His Excellency The Right Honourable James Brendan \r\nBolger, and inviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\nMr. BOLGER (New Zealand): Mr. President, New Zealand congratulates \r\nyou on your election to lead the Assembly and offers you its support in your \r\ntask. \r\nOne year ago I stood on this rostrum and spoke about the Gulf crisis and \r\nthe way in which the United Nations, with strong leadership from the Security \r\nCouncil, had shown a firmness of judgement and a commitment to the ideals of \r\nthe founders of the United Nations that reinforced the status and authority of \r\nthe Organization. \r\nI spoke of my own country. New Zealand, a small nation in the south-west \r\nPacific, which supported the United Nations, in keeping with our tradition of \r\nopposing tyranny and supporting freedom. \r\nThis year I have returned to this Organization even more confident of the \r\nvital role of the United Nations in today\u0027s world, of the important \r\ncontribution each nation, be it large or small, can make to the achievement of \r\nits ideals. Most important, however, I want to affirm the commitmert of New \r\nZealand, a founder member of the United Nations, to ensuring that this \r\nOrganization adapts to meet the challenge of a world that has changed, is \r\nchanging and will continue to change in the years ahead. To do that, the \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Bolger. New Zealand) \r\nUnited Nations requires a vibrant, active General Assembly and a Security \r\nCouncil that truly reflects the different regions and the different peoples of \r\nthe world. \r\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali,, has made his views clear in \r\nputting before this Assembly his report, \"An Agenda for Peace\". His message \r\nis summed up in paragraphs 75 and 76, where he says: \r\n\"With the cold war ended we have drawn back from the brink of a \r\nconfrontation that threatened the world and, too often, paralysed our \r\nOrganization. \r\n\"Even as we celebrate our restored possibilities, there is a need to \r\nensure that the lessons of the past ... are learned and that the \r\nerrors ... are not repeated. For there may not be a third opportunity \r\nfor our planet ... .\" (A/47/277, paras. 75-76) \r\nNew Zealand endorses that conclusion. \r\nWe can also take hope from the fact that at last both the Security \r\nCouncil and the Assembly have the chance to work as they were originally \r\nintended, free from crippling ideological competition. Through the Security \r\nCouncil, and with the support of all the Members of the United Nations, we \r\nhave seen decisive action to implement collective security measures on a scale \r\nnever before possible. \r\nThere is much still to be done, but no longer need the people of the \r\nworld despair about impotence and inaction on the part of the United Nations. \r\nIn Cambodia, in Somalia, in the Balkans, in the Middle East, the United \r\nNations has moved to assist in the vital battle for human survival where \r\nbefore there was only the prospect of continued death and destruction. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n54 \r\n(Mr. Bolger. New Zealand) \r\nIn our view, the Agenda for Peace will succeed only if we support an \r\nagenda for action. This is no time for complacency. The heavy cloud of the \r\ncold war has lifted. But over the years that cloud concealed many smaller \r\nconflicts and tensions regional, national and ethnic. Freed from being \r\nbottled up by the cold war, a growing and frightening tendency is exposed to \r\nsettle ancient differences by the use of force. \r\nThe Agenda for Peace also reminds us that there are other critical issues \r\nwhich threaten not only the security of Member States but also the future of \r\nthe planet itself. \r\nPoverty, disease, malnutrition, crippling levels of debt and negligible \r\neconomic growth are scourges in themselves. They can unleash despair and \r\nanger that will destabilize political and social institutions. \r\nEnvironmental degradation does not threaten only our immediate \r\nsurroundings and livelihoods; problems such as the depletion of the ozone \r\nlayer, the spread of toxic chemicals, climate change and the overfishing of \r\nthe seas put at risk the well-being of whole communities, and even the very \r\nsurvival of certain small island countries. \r\nWeapons of mass destruction continue to proliferate. We must take a \r\nstand against those who are blind to the lessons of the past and remain \r\ndetermined to acquire or expand their stocks of nuclear or other weapons of \r\nmass destruction. \r\nThe Secretary-General reminds us, too, that \r\n\"social peace is as important as strategic or political peace\". \r\n(A/47/277, para. 59) \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n55 \r\n(Mr. Boloer. New Zealand) \r\nIt is clear that a root cause of insecurity and conflict at the international \r\nlevel is the existence of social structures, policies and systems within \r\nStates which marginalize minorities or other groups. Such tension will be \r\nresolved only when the social needs of the underprivileged are addressed. The \r\nproposed United Nations social Summit could have a catalytic role to play in \r\nthis area. I suggest that it is only through tolerance and through talking to \r\none another that we can all encourage and achieve full respect for human \r\nrights and implement the international standards as they were intended. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n56 \r\n(Mr. Bolger. New Zealand) \r\nThe other very important issues raised by the Secretary-General must be \r\nconsidered thoroughly. This session of the Assembly provides the first \r\nopportunity to debate them and I wish to outline New Zealand\u0027s views. \r\nFirst, let me refer to peace and security. New Zealand stands very \r\nfirmly behind the United Nations as an instrument for collective action when \r\nsecurity is threatened. The situations which the world wants the United \r\nNations to respond to today are not the same as those of the cold-war era. \r\nNew Zealand supports concepts such as preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and \r\npeace-building. As a world body we know that consensus is important but \r\ncollectively we must be bold, we must be innovative. \r\nNew Zealand believes it is vital that the United Nations respond to \r\nsituations which threaten the peace or cry out for global action, wherever in \r\nthe world they may occur. We cannot, we must not, allow parts of the world to \r\nbe marginalized or thought less important than others. The tragedy in Somalia \r\nis different from, but of equal horror to, that in what was Yugoslavia. \r\nSecondly, I want to endorse strongly the conclusion that there is an \r\ninextricable link between security and economic development. This is not a \r\nnew or radical idea. Every political leader knows from domestic experience \r\nthat a nation feels more secure when its economy is performing strongly. \r\nPeople in every country have rapidly growing expectations, but with the global \r\neconomy very sluggish leaders are finding it difficult to satisfy these \r\nambitions. \r\nFurther, we need major sustainable growth in the global economy if the \r\ndevelopment concerns identified at the Earth summit at Rio are to be achieved. \r\nOne fact, though self-evident, must be repeated: sustainable and \r\nequitable economic growth and development will be possible only if there is an \r\nopen and fair international trading system. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Boloer. New Zealand) \r\nAs a world community we need the courage to pull down the artificial \r\nbarriers to economic growth. The solution is in our hands. We need leaders \r\nto say \"Yes\" to fair trade and \"No\" to their protectionist lobbies. If we \r\nknock out the selfish and inward-looking tendencies to protectionism and \r\nsubsidization, we will create a surge in global trade and real growth in the \r\nglobal economy. It will provide the opportunities we all want - so let\u0027s do \r\nit. \r\nThe alternative is bleak. History shows only too clearly what can happen \r\nif there is a deep and prolonged global recession. Political extremists come \r\nto the fore and begin to manipulate desperate people. Disintegrating \r\neconomies fall into the hands of dictators, and international peace and \r\nsecurity are quickly put at risk. \r\nBut this need not be so. It is not inevitable. A breakthrough in the \r\nmultilateral trade negotiations, the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on \r\nTariffs and Trade (GATT), is achievable, given the right degree of political \r\nwill. There is a risk that the political will may ebb away, that the focus \r\nmay be lost, that excuses for delay may become more important than reasons to \r\npress on. Should that prove true, then the bold reform set out in the Dunkel \r\ntext will go down as one more lost opportunity. We cannot afford that so we \r\nNew Zealand - continue to urge the European Community and the United States to \r\nresolve their differences and to put the GATT talks back on track for a \r\nsuccessful conclusion. For world economic growth, it is not an optional \r\nextra; it is essential. \r\nJust as economics and security are closely linked, the world seems to \r\nhave accepted, just in time, that there is a third element to this equation. \r\nIt is the environment. Everything we do has an impact on the environment. If \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n57-a \r\n(Mr. Bolger. New Zealand) \r\nwe cripple the environment, it will affect our economies, our societies and \r\nour security. Moreover, these impacts will not respect national boundaries. \r\nBefore the Earth summit, some important first steps were taken. The \r\nMontreal Protocol proved that the world had the political will to deal with \r\nthe problem of ozone depletion. The General Assembly itself responded to the \r\nchallenge of drift-net fishing and has secured a moratorium on that \r\necologically-destructive technique of fishing. \r\nThe Earth summit, under the auspices of the United Nations, has given us \r\na challenging work programme, \"Agenda 21\", to match the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\nproposals, \"An Agenda for Peace\". But international agendas only work if \r\nnations are committed to their success. \r\nNew Zealand went to the Earth summit committed to working for consensus \r\nsolutions to the problems of environment and development which ultimately \r\nthreaten us all. \r\nNew Zealand is a country endowed with a rich environmental inheritance. \r\nBut we understand that our good fortune does not give us the moral right to \r\npoint the finger at other countries which are struggling for their very \r\nsurvival. At the same time, our considerable experience in sustainable \r\nresource management - for example, in the development of new forests can be \r\nhelpful in the search for practical solutions to problems of resource \r\ndepletion. \r\nAs part of New Zealand\u0027s commitment to environmental protection and to \r\nproviding sustainable resources, we have just agreed to go ahead with the \r\nplanting of another 200,000 hectares of forest. \r\nAt the Earth summit, we accepted a commitment to augment our aid \r\nprogramme as soon as possible in order to assist in the prompt and effective \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr. Boloer. New Zealand) \r\nimplementation of Agenda 21. Our development assistance projects, based on \r\nconsultation with our partner countries, particularly in the South Pacific, \r\nhave always had a strong focus on the environment and on sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\nBut aid alone is not enough. New Zealand, like many countries which \r\ndepend on agricultural exports, has been severely disadvantaged by a world \r\ntrading system which handicaps non-subsidized and efficient producers. We \r\ntherefore strongly support the call in Agenda 21 for an open, transparent and \r\nnon-discriminatory trading system that reveals the real environmental costs of \r\nunsustainable production and enables all countries to pursue truly sustainable \r\ndevelopment on a secure and equitable basis. \r\nTo achieve that would be to achieve a real foundation for peace and \r\nprogress. I am not making these observations from an ivory tower. For its \r\npart. New Zealand already has one of the most open economies in the world. \r\nYes, there was a short-term cost in achieving that, but now we are reaping \r\nrewards through higher productivity and international competitiveness. \r\nDespite the progress made from the ending of the cold war, we have not \r\nyet removed the threat from weapons of mass destruction. \r\nNew Zealand warmly welcomed the agreement reached by President Bush and \r\nPresident Yeltsin in June. The two largest nuclear arsenals are to be reduced \r\nby some 70 per cent. That is remarkable progress and both leaders deserve and \r\nhave our thanks. They have made historic progress but we must keep the \r\nmomentum up. Unless we take decisive action, the dangers from nuclear \r\nproliferation will increase. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n59-60 \r\n(Mr. Bolaer. New Zealand) \r\nTherefore we must build on the leadership shown by two nuclear-weapon \r\nStates in declaring moratoriums. We must advance the goal, which New Zealand \r\nhas unwaveringly pursued, of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We must \r\nstrengthen the International Atomic Energy Agency\u0027s safeguards regime. And we \r\nmust secure an indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons in 1995. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n61 \r\n(Mr. Bolger. New Zealand) \r\nFrance\u0027s decision to suspend testing has been widely welcomed by New \r\nZealand and Pacific island countries in the South Pacific Forum region. It \r\nhas opened the way for significantly more positive relations between France \r\nand the region, which I welcome. We hope the moratorium will be maintained, \r\nand copied by others. \r\nAnother milestone approaches, with the presentation to this session of \r\nthe General Assembly of a treaty banning another class of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction: chemical weapons. Patient and persistent efforts over 20 years \r\nwill have their reward. New Zealand has strongly supported those efforts and \r\nintends to be an original signatory to the treaty. We urge other countries to \r\ntake the same step. \r\nAnd we must not ignore the continued proliferation of conventional \r\narmaments. There are legitimate concerns about the levels and availability of \r\nhighly destructive conventional weapons. The implementation of the United \r\nNations Register of Conventional Arms would be a useful first step on the way \r\nto greater accountability in this area. \r\nFinally, I want to touch on the institutional issues the \r\nSecretary-General has raised. We strongly endorse the role that is envisaged \r\nfor the United Nations to work with, and on occasions through, regional \r\norganizations that have some special contribution they can make. Already in \r\nSouth Africa we see cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nCommonwealth beginning to bear positive fruit. In Somalia the Organization of \r\nAfrican Unity (OAU), the League of Arab States and the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference have contributed positively to the United Nations mission. \r\nIn the Americas the Organization of American States (OAS) has played an \r\nincreasingly effective role. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Boloer. New Zealand) \r\nThe United Nations role in Cambodia is of particular importance in this \r\nregard. The operation is unique and deserves the highest praise. But the \r\ncountries of the region - which include New Zealand, with 100 men and women in \r\nthe United Nations force have also played a major part in bringing about the \r\nconditions necessary for a successful United Nations involvement. Regional \r\norganizations such as the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have \r\nbeen indispensable in this process. \r\nThe fact of the matter is that the United Nations cannot do everything. \r\nNeither do I expect it to do everything - but free from the shackles of the \r\npast it now has a new authority which it must exercise wisely. To maintain \r\nits authority we must ensure that democratic principles are applied to the \r\nworkings of the United Nations itself. That means that the small must be \r\nrepresented in major United Nations decision-making as well as the large. \r\nIt means that there must be fair and regular rotation among Member \r\nStates. And it means we must evolve processes that will allow constructive \r\ncommunication between the Security Council and the wider United Nations \r\nmembership so that broad coalitions in support of Security Council action can \r\nbe forged while preserving room for quick and decisive actions where necessary. \r\nNew Zealand\u0027s commitment to a strong, effective and democratic United \r\nNations has never wavered. At the beginning, at the San Francisco Conference \r\nin 1945, New Zealand championed the broadest possible participation in \r\ndecision-making. Over the years we have backed up our words with a real \r\ncommitment to United Nations peace-keeping efforts. We have participated thus \r\nfar in 15 such operations: New Zealanders have worn the blue beret in Croatia \r\nand Bosnia, Lebanon, Cyprus, India, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Namibia, Angola, \r\nCambodia, the Congo and Yemen. In addition. New Zealand supplied personnel to \r\nassist the United Nations with mine removal in Afghanistan. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. Bolger. New Zealand) \r\nIn conclusion, I want to return to the two agendas which are before this \r\nAssembly and which seek to achieve a new partnership of nations. Nothing is \r\nmore important than the Agenda for Peace and the Agenda for the Environment \r\nand Sustainable Development. The United Nations Secretary-General and the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development have both identified \r\nmonumental challenges for the General Assembly for several years to come. \r\nThey also highlight the reality of global interdependence. The way ahead has \r\nto lie in cooperation rather than confrontation, in a recognition that the \r\nfuture of each of us is tied up with the future of us all and that no agenda, \r\nno matter how noble its goals, will succeed unless first and foremost we are \r\nprepared to work for them. New Zealand is. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe Prime Minister of New Zealand for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. James Brendan Boloer. Prime Minister of New Zealand, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum. \r\nMr. PAPACONSTANTINOU (Greece): Allow me, first of all, to extend to \r\nyou. Sir, the warmest congratulations of the Greek Government on your election \r\nto the presidency. Your personal qualities and diplomatic skill augur well \r\nfor progress on the work of this session. Moreover, we are especially pleased \r\nto salute in your person the representative of a neighbouring country with \r\nwhich Greece maintains long-standing relations of close friendship. I also \r\nwish to pay tribute to your predecessor. Ambassador Shihabi, for the effective \r\nmanner in which he discharged his functions as President of the Assembly last \r\nyear. \r\nAllow me also to point out how impressed the Greek Government is by the \r\nway the Secretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n64 \r\n(Mr. Papaconstantinou. Greece) \r\nbeen discharging his duties since he took office at the beginning of the \r\nyear. We are absolutely certain that he will continue his work with the same \r\ndynamism and diplomatic dexterity, for the benefit of both the international \r\ncommunity and this Organization, which has grown since the General Assembly \r\nlast met a year ago. \r\nLet me also join other representatives in welcoming the new Members that \r\nhave been admitted to the United Nations as independent States, namely \r\nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, \r\nKyrgyzstan, Moldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and \r\nUzbekistan. \r\nThe admission of these new Members is a renewed expression of the desire \r\nof our Organization to welcome in its midst all those States that undertake \r\nthe commitment to adhere to the purposes and principles set out in the United \r\nNations Charter. \r\nEarlier this week the Foreign Minister of the United Kingdom, in his \r\ncapacity as President of the Council of the European Community, delivered a \r\nstatement on behalf of its 12 Member States. My Government fully subscribes \r\nto the contents of that statement. \r\nGreece is firmly committed to, and fully supports, the process of \r\nEuropean integration. We believe that the economic and political union we \r\nagreed on when we adopted the Maastricht Treaty last year will strengthen \r\nprogress and enhance prosperity not only on the European continent, but also \r\nin all the countries the Community is trading with. Greece was among the \r\nfirst European countries to ratify the Maastricht Treaty, and we are happy \r\nthat the French people as well ratified the Treaty at the referendum of last \r\nSunday. Allow me to note that the \"yes\" vote in the Greek Parliament was \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n65 \r\n(Mr. Papaconstantinou. Greece) \r\noverwhelming 286 positive votes out of a total of 300 deputies voting - and \r\nis indicative of the extraordinary degree of unanimity of the Greek people \r\nconcerning the position of our country for a united Europe. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n66 \r\n(Mr. Papaconstantinou. Greece) \r\nI have the honour to stand before this Assembly as the representative of \r\na nation that is now completing a year-long celebration marking 2,500 years \r\nsince our ancestors first invented a form of government called in Greek \r\ndemokratia. which in rough translation means \"rule by the people\": democracy, \r\nwhich was destined to become one of the most outstanding contributions of \r\nGreece to the collective heritage of mankind and a cornerstone of world \r\ncivilization. We Greeks felt happy and, allow me to say, proud a year ago, as \r\nwe saw democracy and its twin principle, freedom, gaining ground throughout \r\nthe world and consolidating its presence in countries where totalitarianism \r\nhad long held sway. In welcoming new members to the community of free \r\nnations, the Greek Government expressed the hope that the post-cold-war world \r\nwould be based on the principles of democracy and freedom, on respect for \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, and on the rule of law. \r\nThat hope was expressed a year ago. Can we now, a year later, ascertain \r\nthe extent to which it has been met? Admittedly, a year\u0027s time is too short \r\nto allow a conclusive judgement, but the events of the last 12 months offer \r\nsome evidence of the direction in which the world is moving. And, I must say, \r\nthe evidence available is not as encouraging as our expectations were. In \r\nfact, we have witnessed developments that threaten the fragile positive trends \r\nwe had begun to see. We have seen peoples that gained their freedom and \r\nindependence taking the path of nationalism. Signs abound that we are \r\nentering a dangerous and unpredictable world situation, where conflicts, \r\nextreme nationalism and tensions of a new nature are erupting, and where the \r\nclash of interests could take the place of the ideological confrontations of \r\nwhich we have had bitter experience in the past. \r\nIn spite of the comfort of being safe at last from the threat of nuclear \r\nannihilation since the recent enormous strides in disarmament, in some areas \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n67 \r\n(Mr. Papaconstantinou. Greece) \r\nthe world seems to be moving into a state of uncontrolled proliferation of \r\nconventional arms and civil strife. In some cases, that civil strife seems to \r\nbe on the brink of spilling over and becoming a threat to regional and \r\ninternational peace and security. To make matters worse, the weak economies \r\nof many developing countries remain in the grip of a deepening crisis, while \r\ngrowing poverty, and in certain cases even hunger, is becoming a menace to \r\nrecent gains in democracy. And the environment continues to deteriorate at an \r\nalarming pace. \r\nFaced with such a situation, the world community has to react \r\ncollectively. And as it is the United Nations that embodies the collegiality \r\nof the world community, it is incumbent upon it to devise ways and means to \r\nhelp humanity deal with the situation. In this respect, the nations and the \r\npeoples of the world are fortunate in that, with the cold war behind us, the \r\nparalysis that had for a long time plagued our Organization has now \r\ndisappeared. The United Nations is now indeed showing signs that it is \r\nwilling to live up to the expectations placed in it. \r\nA series of actions is being undertaken to deal with the major problems \r\nconfronting humanity now. In this context, earlier this year, the United \r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development, the largest summit ever \r\nheld, met at Rio de Janeiro. Next year we will see the Second World \r\nConference on Human Rights. In 1994, population and development will be dealt \r\nwith. In 1995, the World Conference on Women will take place. Finally, a \r\nworld summit for social development has been proposed. \r\nBut the first in this series of actions was taken last January and \r\ndirectly concerned international peace and security. The Greek Government \r\nwelcomed the convening of the Security Council at the summit level to reaffirm \r\nthe world community\u0027s devotion to the principle of collective security and to \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n68 \r\n(Mr. Papaconstantinou. Greece) \r\nthe settlement of disputes in accordance with the principles of the United \r\nNations Charter, and to consider anew the means by which collective security \r\ncan be upheld through the Organization. \r\nGreece has also welcomed the document entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\", on \r\npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping, issued by the \r\nSecretary-General in response to a request made by the members of the Security \r\nCouncil at their January summit meeting. I take this opportunity to express \r\nour appreciation to the Secretary-General for a document of vision, lucidity \r\nand challenging ideas. We in the Greek Government have studied it with great \r\ninterest and are looking forward to participating in the fruitful debates that \r\nare bound to follow in the various bodies of our Organization. \r\nWe are pleased that the Secretary-General sees the concepts of preventive \r\ndiplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping in their proper perspective within \r\nthe larger concept of peace and security that goes beyond the military sphere \r\nand encompasses social and economic factors, primary among which is the \r\nenjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. \r\nWe are also encouraged that the Secretary-General has not failed to \r\nemphasize the importance of democracy not only within nations but also among \r\nthe family of nations. \r\nThe perception of selectivity in the application of the principles of the \r\nCharter must be avoided if the moral authority of the United Nations is to be \r\nmaintained. This is particularly urgent now that the enforcement capability \r\nof the Organization is being enhanced and put to use. Enforcement without \r\nmoral authority is coercion and tyranny. Smaller nations need to be reassured \r\nthat no Power will succeed in usurping the moral authority of the United \r\nNations and using it for the advancement of its own interests. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n69-70 \r\n(Mr. Papaconstantinou. Greece) \r\nIt is the fervent hope of the Greek Government that the current turbulent \r\nsituation will prove to be only a brief transition and will soon be replaced \r\nby a spirit of international cooperation and solidarity. The deployment of \r\ncommon efforts for the maintenance of international peace and security through \r\npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping are an indispensable \r\nmanifestation of such international solidarity. The other two foundations on \r\nwhich this solidarity must be based are respect for human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms and a common concern for the protection of the \r\nenvironment. \r\nThe subject of human rights is, of course, not new. We rejoice that the \r\nEuropean Community has time and again emphasized that respect for, and \r\npromotion and safeguarding of human rights is an essential element in \r\ninternational relations and, therefore, one of the cornerstones of cooperation \r\nand of relations between the Community and its member States and other \r\ncountries. \r\nThe expression of concern about human rights violations can no longer be \r\nconsidered mere interference in a State\u0027s internal affairs. Established \r\nprinciples governing relations among States - such as non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of other States and respect for the national sovereignty of \r\nStates must accommodate efforts by the United Nations and by regional \r\norganizations to protect the human rights of individuals and social groups \r\nthat are threatened in particular States. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n71 \r\n(Mr. Papaconstantinou. Greece) \r\nA few words about Greece\u0027s relations with its neighbours and the state of \r\naffairs in our region. \r\nWe have repeatedly and officially stated that Greece has no territorial \r\nclaims whatsoever against any of the countries neighbouring ours. We offer \r\nour friendship to all of them and we hope, indeed we are certain, they will \r\nreciprocate. We maintain the best possible relations with our Balkan as well \r\nas our Mediterranean neighbours. \r\nRegarding our relations with Turkey, we consider that it is of primary \r\nimportance for Greece and our neighbour Turkey that our two countries display \r\nthe necessary will and imagination to create a climate of mutual confidence, \r\nsecurity and stability which will redound to the benefit of the Eastern \r\nMediterranean in general and our two peoples in particular. \r\nGreece believes that it is high time for our two neighbouring States to \r\nfind the way, on the basis of international law and international conventions \r\nand treaties, to establish closer relations, compatible with the requirements \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations, the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter \r\nof Paris, as well as with the espectations of our peoples, dictated by \r\ngeographical proximity and by common interests. This intention, our political \r\nwill and our sincere desire have been repeatedly stressed by our Prime \r\nMinister, Mr. Mitsotakis, who has already met with the Prime Minister of \r\nTurkey, Mr. Demirel, four times this year, while I have had the opportunity to \r\nspeak in the same spirit to my Turkish counterpart, Mr. Hikmet Cetin, with \r\nwhom I have already met three or four times. We, for our part, laid emphasis \r\non the fact that the problem of Cyprus, which exercises a negative influence \r\non our bilateral relations, should at last find a proper solution on the basis \r\nof all relevant United Nations resolutions. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n72 \r\n(Mr. Papaconstantinou. Greece) \r\nI should like to remind the Assembly that despite coordinated efforts the \r\nproblem remains unresolved. Cyprus continues to be divided and a large part \r\nof its territory is still under Turkish occupation. The other consequences of \r\nthe 1974 invasion, such as those of the refugees, the missing persons, and the \r\ncontinuing efforts to change the demographic structure of the island and to \r\nplunder of Cyprus\u0027 cultural heritage, still exist and constitute the main \r\nelements of the tragic reality of this Mediterranean island, an integral part \r\nof the European family and a State Member of this Organization. In this \r\nrespect, the report of the European Commission of Human Rights published on \r\n2 April 1992 sets out the violations of human rights in Cyprus, concerning \r\nmissing and displaced persons, separation of families, deprivation of \r\npossessions and so on. \r\nDespite the present status quo in Cyprus which the most recent Security \r\nCouncil resolution explicitly characterizes as not acceptable we, together \r\nwith the international community, look forward to the systematic efforts of \r\nthe Secretary-General with the active support of the five permanent members \r\nof the Security Council to bring about a just, a viable and a functional \r\nsolution to the Cyprus problem. \r\nIn this respect, we note that the Secretary-General\u0027s set of ideas, \r\nincluding the map attached thereto, which was initially discussed last July \r\nand August, with special emphasis on the territorial, refugee and property \r\nissues, should form the basis of negotiations during the follow-on talks \r\nscheduled to be resumed in New York in late October. \r\nWe urge Turkey to use all its decisive influence on the Turkish-Cypriot \r\nside to ensure that it approaches the talks in a constructive manner which may \r\nwell contribute to the solution of the problem and the elimination of a real \r\nanachronism in today\u0027s Europe. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n73 \r\n(Mr. Papaconstantinou. Greece) \r\nIn conclusion on this subject, I wish to stress once again that the just \r\nsettlement of this problem would greatly benefit relations between our two \r\npeoples and our two countries. Moreover, it would also constitute an \r\nimportant element of Turkey\u0027s aspirations to its European orientation. We \r\nhave been trying, most emphatically, to make it clear that it is our will to \r\nestablish the most friendly relations with our neighbour Turkey. I do not \r\nthink that the international community would be proud if it were to leave this \r\nproblem, which has been dragging on for over 18 years, unresolved. \r\nThe situation in the Balkans remains a cause of major concern to all. \r\nThe Yugoslav crisis continues to constitute a potential danger for \r\ndestabilization of the whole Balkans and a danger for peace and security in \r\nthe wider area. Greece, as a Balkan country, naturally is directly concerned \r\nand, therefore, from the very beginning of the crisis has not spared any \r\neffort to achieve a speedy and negotiated solution. The convening of the \r\nLondon Conference under the co-chairmanship of the European Community and the \r\nUnited Nations represents our only hope for a lasting settlement. We wish to \r\nreiterate here our full support to the chairmanship of the Conference, to \r\nwhich we are ready to offer all our assistance. \r\nThe Assembly should send a clear message to all former Yugoslav parties \r\nthat there can be no alternative to a negotiated solution of the crisis and \r\nthat the international community is determined not to recognize any \r\nfait accompli created by force. We believe that no single party is to blame \r\nfor the current crisis and its horrors and that all share part of the blame. \r\nIn any event, we must act swiftly to stop the war before it is too late, for \r\nthe dangers of spill-over of the crisis are real. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n74-75 \r\n(Mr. Papaconstantinou. Greece) \r\nAny form of military intervention in the former Yugoslavia is highly \r\ninadvisable. We have cautioned against it because we consider the staging of \r\na war to stop another war absurd and self-defeating. Indeed, if a majority of \r\nother States were to decide on some form of military intervention in \r\nYugoslavia, Greece would in no way participate. All States - and mainly \r\nBalkan States - that neighbour the former Yugoslavia, and all States with a \r\nspecial interest in the area, should in any case be excluded from such \r\naction. Otherwise, the enmities, the mistrust and the rekindling of bitter \r\nmemories of the past will be a source of persistent bitterness and instability \r\nfor generations to come. \r\nWe want the Balkans to be an area of peace and we wish to avoid a return \r\nto the time when they were known as the powder-keg of Europe. We want good \r\nrelations with all our Balkan neighbours. We are ready to support them \r\neconomically and also to facilitate the development of their relations with \r\nthe European Community. We have no claims against anybody and we expect them \r\nto have similar motivations toward us. It is for this reason that, as regards \r\nthe former \"Yugoslav Federal Socialist Republic of Macedonia\", we have \r\nactively and consistently advocated full compliance with the Lisbon \r\nDeclaration of the European Community, according to which that Republic should \r\nbe recognized under a name which does not include the term \"Macedonia\". \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n76 \r\n(Mr. Papaconstantinou. Greece) \r\nOtherwise, we will surely have sown the seeds of future tensions and \r\nconflicts in the area and we will have jeopardized the ability of the peoples \r\nof the Balkans to live and coexist peacefully together. Our insistence on \r\nthis point is not only an emotional or sentimental matter, now is it only a \r\nmatter of historical accuracy. It is, more than anything, a matter of \r\npolitical realism. The usurping of a Greek name and of ancient Greek emblems, \r\ncombined with constitutional provisions insinuating territorial expansion, is \r\nnothing if not a clear indication of territorial claims. If we allow this \r\npolicy to be pursued we shall condemn future generations for we shall be \r\nforming the nucleus of friction for some time to come. \r\nHaving said that, I wish to make it quite clear that we have never \r\nharboured any enmity towards this nascent republic. Even when, recently, we \r\nreluctantly had to discontinue fuel exports there, in order to counter \r\nunjustified, unfounded accusations that Greece was circumventing Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 713 (1991) and 757 (1992), we never interfered with the \r\nsupply of food and humanitarian aid. As a matter of fact, exports of fuel \r\nsupplies have already been resumed now that the European Community has adopted \r\nnew regulations to ensure the movement of goods towards the former Yugoslavia \r\nthat safeguard the effectiveness of the United Nations embargo. \r\nThe arms embargo should also be reinforced with respect to all sides and \r\nan effective mechanism for its control should be put in place. \r\nConcerning Kossovo, which is a particularly sensitive, potentially \r\ndangerous area, we should encourage the Serbian Government and the ethnic \r\nAlbanians to pursue a serious and open dialogue within the framework of the \r\nLondon Conference with a view to reaching an early solution to the problems of \r\nthis area. We maintain that a status of autonomy, without any change of \r\nfrontiers, would satisfy all concerned. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n77 \r\n(Mr. Papaconstantinou. Greece) \r\nThe international community must also be alerted to the various reports \r\nfrom many parts of the former Yugoslavia concerning atrocities. It should be \r\nmade clear to all those who are responsible for such acts that they will be \r\nheld personally responsible. This is a point about which my Government feels \r\nparticularly strongly. \r\nThe easing of international tensions with the end of the cold war \r\nprovides new possibilities and resources for development. Our immediate \r\nobjective should be to restore growth that would not irreparably destroy the \r\nair, the rivers, the forests, the oceans or any other part of nature. The \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development held at Rio de \r\nJaneiro last June has raised high hopes that the consensus which has emerged \r\nand which strikes a balance between environment and development will be \r\nsustained. At the same time, we note with great satisfaction that a political \r\nconsensus is growing concerning the fundamental relationship between \r\npluralistic democracy, respect for human rights, and development as an \r\nequitable and sustainable process. \r\nNow that the end of the cold war has raised the hopes of millions, a \r\nsystem of collective security is envisaged to preserve world peace and \r\nstability and to provide a new vision of development very much along the lines \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. Economic and social development is not \r\npossible without peace and stability, which are prerequisites and not \r\nsubstitutes for development. The last 18 months have witnessed profound \r\nhistoric changes in the world economy. A large part of the world remains in a \r\nstate of transition and uncertainty while it is being transformed \r\nfundamentally. The Secretary-General has offered us a new concept of \r\nintegrated development no longer based on the traditional strict \r\ndifferentiation among political, economic and social issues. In his \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n78 \r\n(Mr. Papaconstantinou. Greece) \r\nintroductory remarks to the high-level segment of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, he argued in favour of an integrated approach to global issues under \r\nwhich the United Nations system, through preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and \r\npeace-keeping will bring its political influence to bear on the solution of \r\neconomic and social issues. This approach is best suited to the Organization \r\nbecause it will secure \"a unit thrust\" in all the activities of the United \r\nnations system through enhanced coordination of agencies. \r\nThe recently concluded Conference on Environment and Development held at \r\nRio de Janeiro is a first example of this approach. A conceptual bridge was \r\ncrossed there. We hope that fundamental principles agreed on at Rio de \r\nJaneiro will be translated into concrete action. \r\nThe world economic situation presents an uneven and variegated picture. \r\nIn countries where there is a movement towards a market system, economic \r\ndifficulties are increasing, exacerbated by new assertions of nationalism, as \r\nwell as by ethnic and religious challenges, which threaten social peace and \r\nthe cohesion of States. \r\nIn the developing countries growth remains on the whole sluggish, while \r\nthere has been great diversity in performance among them. Moreover, the \r\nproblems which plagued the developing world in the 1980s still persist. As \r\npointed out in the World Economic Survey. 1992. world production fell in 1991 \r\nfor the first time since the Second World War, and the recovery that was \r\nbeginning to take shape appeared to be exceptionally weak. The Uruguay Round \r\nof trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) \r\nremains stalled. Financial assistance for development purposes is still hard \r\nto come by, while developing and other countries must complete painful \r\nadjustment programmes. High inflation, large-scale deficits, debt burdens and \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n79-80 \r\n(Mr. Papaconstantinou. Greece) \r\nlack of adequate investments have not yet shown signs of improvement. \r\nFurthermore, economic hardship has given rise to fanaticism, unchecked \r\nmigratory movements, civil strife and criminal acts. Development continues to \r\nbe the most serious challenge of all countries. \r\nThe world economic situation provides an opportunity for a strengthening \r\nof the role of the United Nations system as regards enhancing international \r\ncooperation for development. The important political changes of the last two \r\nyears and the integrated nature of political, economic and social issues call \r\nfor the United Nations to play a major role in shaping the directions of \r\nsocial and economic development. \r\nProgress in the regional conflicts that have been on the agenda of our \r\nOrganization has again been uneven. Peace in the Middle East remains \r\nelusive. The most important element of the Middle East problem is the \r\nArab-Israeli conflict. Two of the most ancient peoples in the world, each of \r\nwhich has made outstanding contributions to the common heritage of mankind, \r\nhave for decades confronted each other, seemingly unwilling to accept for the \r\nother what each demands for itself, that is, the right to exist within safe \r\nand recognized borders, the right to a homeland, and the right to take charge \r\nof its own destiny. However, the events of the last 12 months seem to \r\nindicate that each side may now be prepared to accept for the other at least \r\npart of what it demands for itself. And this development, although in itself \r\nnot sufficient for the solution to the conflict, does seem to justify the \r\njudgement that the chances for peace are better now than they were a year ago. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n81 \r\n(Mr. Papaconstantinou. Greece) \r\nI wish in this connection to pay tribute to the commitment and \r\nperseverance of the sponsors of the peace process launched in Madrid in \r\nOctober 1991, as well as to the wisdom and courage displayed by the parties \r\ndirectly involved. It is the fervent hope of the Greek Government that the \r\nnew Israeli Government, as well as the Arab parties involved, will seize the \r\nopportunity to work together towards a comprehensive peace. \r\nNo one can dispute today that apartheid is an unacceptable political \r\nsystem that has to be eradicated in all its forms and practical consequences. \r\nFurthermore, the international community and the main political leaders in \r\nSouth Africa are committed to the creation of a united, non-racial and \r\ndemocratic South African society through peaceful means and through \r\nnegotiations involving all parties concerned. \r\nHowever, the recent wave of violence in South Africa, which claimed many \r\ninnocent lives, seemed to pose a serious threat to the negotiating process, \r\nand to undermine the results achieved so far. Greece firmly believes that no \r\neffort should be spared to help South African society keep the momentum and to \r\ncontinue building upon what has been achieved. Let us bear in mind that, now \r\nmore than ever, the new reality of intensified subregional, regional and \r\ninternational cooperation in the political and economic fields points to an \r\nimportant role for a new, democratic, united and non-racial South Africa. \r\nIn the Horn of Africa, in Somalia, a human tragedy of almost \r\nunprecedented scale is unfolding. War, drought and the collapse of civil \r\nauthority threaten the very existence of the country: the physical \r\nexistence the lives of its people. Starvation has already claimed \r\nthousands of lives. \r\nWe know, however, that the difficulties of the two regions I have just \r\nreferred to are only part of a more complicated, multifaceted structural p \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n82 \r\n(Mr. Papaconstantinou. Greece) \r\nroblem faced by the whole continent of Africa in all fields of human \r\nactivity. We have to give all possible help to the countries of Africa to \r\nsolve their present problems and to undertake new efforts of cooperation and \r\nintegration which will foster development, peace and stability. \r\nThe Greek Government welcomes the positive results of the Helsinki summit \r\nof 1992 in the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope (CSCE) and attaches particular importance to the comprehensive nature \r\nof the CSCE process, which brings together the Governments and the peoples of \r\nEurope and those of the United States and Canada. The Helsinki follow-up \r\nmeeting provided an important opportunity for discussions on the future role \r\nof the CSCE. In particular, the strengthening of its institutions is expected \r\nto increase the effectiveness of the CSCE in the prevention, management and \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. The Concluding Document adopted at the \r\nsummit characterizes the CSCE as a regional arrangement in the sense of the \r\nprovisions of Chapter VIII of the United Nation Charter. In that way, the \r\nCSCE process contributes substantially to the collegiality of the world \r\ncommunity and is therefore supported wholeheartedly by the Greek Government. \r\nAlthough the international community has increased its cooperation in \r\ncombating drug abuse and the illicit production of and trafficking in \r\nnarcotics, this scourge continues to plague and undermine our societies. \r\nConsequently, further intensified and more effective international cooperation \r\nis required within the existing international and regional mechanisms provided \r\nfor by the United Nations and regional organizations. \r\nMy country, which lies at the crossroads of the world, continues to be \r\nactively engaged in the fight against drugs. It is in the process of adopting \r\nnew legislation and policies to enhance its effectiveness in combating the \r\nproblem. Furthermore, we have increased our cooperation with all States of \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n83-85 \r\n(Mr. Papaconstantinou. Greece) \r\nour region with a view to adopting and implementing effective practical \r\nmeasures against drug trafficking. \r\nIn conclusion, I should like to reaffirm my country\u0027s commitment to the \r\nUnited Nations and to the spirit of international cooperation and solidarity \r\nit embodies. We join forces with the other nations of the world and pledge to \r\nmake every possible effort for world peace and stability and for a humane \r\ninternational community, on an enduringly beautiful planet. \r\nMr. TAVERAS GUZMAN (Dominican Republic) (interpretation from \r\nSpanish): Permit me to begin. Sir, by taking this opportunity to convey to \r\nyou the congratulations of the delegation of the Dominican Republic on your \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh \r\nsession. Coming from a region that is taking on a new dimension in the \r\ninternational community, you will no doubt take a realistic view of the major \r\nchallenges posed by the world situation. You have first-hand experience of \r\nthe transformations taking place in the world. You are thus superbly \r\nqualified to guide with composure the deliberations of the Assembly. \r\nWe wish also to pay a warm tribute to the distinguished Saudi diplomat. \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Samir S. Shihabi, the outgoing President, for his skill and \r\nfor the fruitful results he achieved in his work. \r\nOn the new international landscape, with the dissolution of the Soviet \r\nUnion and the collapse of communism, the likelihood of a world war has \r\nvanished. But in many regions it remains possible that conflicts of an \r\nunpredictable nature could take place.* \r\n* Mr. Moumin (Comoros), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n86 \r\n(Mr. Taveras Guzman. \r\nDominican Republic) \r\nHence the international community should remain vigilant, because though \r\nit is true that the danger of nuclear war has disappeared, it is no less true \r\nthat another menace is still with us, that of the continued quest, on the part \r\nof some countries, for technology for the production of nuclear weaponry, \r\nbehind the back of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Agency \r\ndeserves to be revitalized so that it will be able to work effectively in its \r\nefforts to prevent the proliferation of those terrible weapons. \r\nMankind is still burdened with problems arising out of the so-called \r\nconventional weapons, which are becoming more and more destructive, and what \r\nis needed is a degree of international control to limit them. That would make \r\navailable resources that, if properly used, could contribute to the \r\ndevelopment of the countries of the third world, which are already suffering \r\nbecause of heavy public debt and restrictive and protectionist measures \r\nimpeding international trade. \r\nThat is the most important challenge facing mankind, and this forum is \r\nthe right place to discuss those issues and create conditions and lay down \r\nguidelines to improve the lot of the two thirds of mankind that today finds \r\nitself threatened, not only by the economic crisis and the inequalities \r\nbetween North and South but also by the continued deterioration of the \r\nenvironment, which has been degraded by our own deliberate or unwitting use \r\nand abuse of it. \r\nI have expressed these thoughts because I come from a country, the \r\nDominican Republic, that is small in size, with an area of only 48,400 square \r\nkilometres and a population of 7,500,000, and we feel the ill effects of the \r\nproblems I have mentioned: burdensome external debt and declining trade \r\nbecause of restrictive and protectionist practices in the countries \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n87 \r\n(Mr. Taveras Guzman. \r\nDominican Republic) \r\nto which we export our agricultural products, whose prices are constantly \r\nfalling in world markets. Our adverse trade situation means that we are \r\nlosing significant resources that could be devoted to our development. \r\nNevertheless, over the last two years the Dominican economy has undergone \r\na successful process of adjustment that has made it possible to eliminate \r\ninflation, stabilize the national currency and bring the budgetary deficit \r\nunder control, all as a result of the adoption of a restrictive monetary \r\npolicy. This has helped to rebuild confidence in the production sectors. We \r\nbelieve that confidence in our country\u0027s business sector in the immediate \r\nfuture is indispensable for the achievement of an accelerated and sustained \r\nrecovery of the Dominican economy. Even more important in that regard is the \r\ncountry\u0027s ability in the short term to increase the foreign-exchange income \r\nthat it needs for its development, at a time when the export of raw materials \r\nis being replaced by service-sector products. \r\nThe Dominican Republic is now pursuing closer ties with the States \r\nmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), with a view to bringing about \r\nour definitive entrance into CARICOM, on the basis of the great significance \r\nthat the Dominican Government attaches at this time to the achievement of a \r\nmore advantageous position vis-a-vis the European Economic Community as a \r\nState member of the Lome Convention, and the Dominican Republic is thus aiming \r\nto bring about greater openness in markets when it comes to selling its \r\nproducts internationally. \r\nThe achievements of the Dominican Republic, despite the grave economic \r\ncrisis suffered in recent years by Latin American and Caribbean countries, \r\nhave been the result of good government, presided over by \r\nDr. Joaquin Balaguer, a champion of democracy who gives us an example of what \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n88-90 \r\n(Mr. Taveras Guzman. \r\nDominican Republic) \r\na leader can do with the scant resources of a poor State when they are used \r\njudiciously to create conditions favourable to the people. Those achievements \r\ninclude, among other things, the construction of thousands of dwellings, \r\nhundreds of kilometres of highways and local roads, as well as schools and \r\nhospitals to provide vital social services to a constantly growing population. \r\nLet me now turn to the situation of our fraternal neighbour, Haiti. \r\nUnfortunately, throughout its existence as an independent country Haiti has \r\nendured a chronic situation of economic penury and the impoverishment of its \r\nsoil. This has forced its population to emigrate in waves across our borders \r\nand by sea in search of a better life. Today that situation is made even more \r\ntragic by the political crisis our Haitian brothers are going through. \r\nThe Dominican authorities and people are not indifferent to that \r\nsituation, which stems from the COUP d\u0027etat that cut short \r\nPresident Aristide\u0027s experiment in democracy. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n91 \r\n(Mr. Taveras Guzman. \r\nDominican Republic) \r\nThat development was condemned by the Organization of American States (OAS), \r\nwhich imposed a trade embargo to compel the current authorities to restore \r\nlegality. So far as the Dominican Government, presided over by \r\nMr. Joaquin Balaguer, is concerned, negotiation and dialogue within the \r\ncontext of absolute respect for the norms of international law are the most \r\nappropriate instruments in the quest for peace. Accordingly, we have been and \r\ncontinue to be providing disinterested support to all the parties to the \r\nconflict, in the hope that a solution that would resolve existing differences \r\ncan be found and that all institutions in the Republic of Haiti can again \r\nfunction normally. \r\nOur Government is deeply democratic, respects human rights and jealously \r\nguards its prerogative of guaranteeing the liberties of those inhabiting the \r\nRepublic. \r\nWe deplore the fragmentation of the former Yugoslavia as well as the \r\ntragedy that has befallen its people. Bereft of any guarantee of their \r\nrights, they are suffering the onslaught of a tragic fratricidal war that is \r\ntaking a heavy toll in human lives, particularly those of women and children, \r\nwho are subjected to constant air attacks and shellings and are deprived of \r\nthe food and medicine they need in order to subsist and treat their wounds and \r\nillnesses. We support the measures adopted by the United Nations with regard \r\nto the former Yugoslavia, measures that urge the parties to respect human \r\nrights and forcefully condemn the loathsome practice of \"ethnic cleansing\". \r\nIt is a source of satisfaction to my delegation to see the communication \r\nthat is developing between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People\u0027s \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n92 \r\n(Mr. Taveras Guzman. \r\nDominican Republic) \r\nRepublic of Korea, aimed at reuniting the Korean family. We regret, however, \r\nthat the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea is persisting in its nuclear \r\nresearch with the aim of building nuclear weapons. \r\nBy the same token, we are optimistic about the situation developing among \r\nthe Arab peoples and the people of Israel, and we hope that this atmosphere of \r\ndialogue and negotiation will gain even greater momentum so that those \r\nconcerned may live in peace and harmony on their lands while moving towards a \r\nfuture of prosperity and progress. \r\nThough the cold war is a thing of the past, the danger and the tragedy of \r\nregional conflicts are still with us. Settling those conflicts requires \r\ninternational cooperation and the good will of the parties involved. However, \r\nanother serious threat to peace and to the well-being of our peoples still \r\nfaces the Americas and other parts of the world. We refer here to drug \r\ntrafficking and the destruction and social and moral harm which that scourge \r\nentails for all our communities. Our country supports every single measure \r\ntaken by the United Nations to cope with this serious problem, and calls for \r\ncontinued efforts to resolve and do away with this global scourge. \r\nIn this vein, the Dominican Republic has been taking forceful steps to \r\nconfront this evil, pursuing a dynamic drug-abuse-prevention drive and at the \r\nsame time launching major administrative, legislative and judicial \r\ninitiatives, not only against drug production, but also against the marketing \r\nof and the trafficking in drugs. Moreover, we have signed bilateral accords \r\nalong these lines with countries in our region and are in the final phase of \r\npreparations leading to our accession to the 1988 United Nations Convention \r\nAgainst Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n93-95 \r\n(Mr. Taveras Guzman, \r\nDominican Republic) \r\nThe facts in terms of the state of the environment the world over are \r\ngrowing ever more alarming and must be a source of concern to, and a reason \r\nfor solidarity among, all States Members of the Organization. \r\nBecause of interdependence, damage done to the environment anywhere in \r\nthe world has an impact upon us all. Accordingly, international cooperation \r\nis necessary so that the States of the third world as well as the \r\nindustrialized nations can strive together to ensure that present and future \r\ngenerations will be able to enjoy a clean planet Earth, where life will be \r\neasier and happier. The Dominican Goverment, aware of these facts, has \r\nembarked on a process of reforesting our country and of conserving our natural \r\nresources. We support whatever steps the international community may take \r\nalong these lines, and, to demonstrate this, we are submitting to the Congress \r\nof our Republic, with a view to accession, the 1985 Vienna Convention for the \r\nProtection of the Ozone Layer, along with its Protocol on Substances that \r\nDeplete the Ozone Layer. \r\nAt this point, we should like to refer to the matter of racial \r\ndiscrimination, yet another major problem that still shocks the conscience of \r\nhumankind and continues to represent a major challenge to and violation of the \r\nmost elementary norms of human rights. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n96 \r\n(Mr. Taveras Guzman. \r\nDominican Republic) \r\nIn this sense, our country has repeatedly, in this very forum, stated its \r\nrejection and repudiation of the apartheid system. Two years ago, right here, \r\nwe expressed satisfaction at the announcement by the President of South \r\nAfrica, Frederick de Klerk, of the recognition of the rights of other races in \r\nthat country to ensure that an end would be put to the system of apartheid. \r\nHowever, today racial tensions continue to escalate, and it is not possible to \r\ndiscern any rapid progress in the process of change in South Africa. The \r\npolicy of apartheid constitutes a crime against the conscience and the dignity \r\nof human beings and, therefore, it must be totally eliminated, so that a \r\ngenuine democracy, based on a multi-ethnic and pluralist system, may be \r\nestablished in South Africa. \r\nThe 1990s have begun with great frustration, but also with great hope \r\nfrustration because of the stagnation or backsliding in terms of social \r\nprogress, which the 1980s left as a legacy to the majority of developing \r\ncountries; hope because what is taking place is a real revolution in thinking, \r\nwhich makes imperative a review and a revision of proposals for the promotion \r\nof development. \r\nIn the economic arena, there is a constant search for ways and means of \r\nfostering the resumption of growth and modernization, as well as the more \r\nactive participation of those countries in the world economy. The data on the \r\nsocial condition of the majority of the world\u0027s population, and the \r\npossibility that those data may worsen as a result of economic measures that \r\nhave been adopted, have made it necessary to place the issue of the social \r\ndimension in the world at the heart of our debate. \r\nThe concept that social issues are a secondary matter, in contrast with \r\nthe primary process taking place in political forums, is a grave and extremely \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n97 \r\n(Mr. Taveras Guzman, \r\nDominican Republic) \r\ncostly mistake. In fact, if we do not deal with the social problems they turn \r\nvery quickly into political problems. The groan of hunger does more than \r\nbreak the silence; eventually it rends peace asunder. That is why the \r\nDominican Republic backs unreservedly the convening of a world summit for \r\nsocial development. We take the view that the concept of human security, \r\nwhich that proposal reflects, refers directly to the important - indeed, the \r\noverriding task facing all societies: the provision of food, clothing and \r\nhousing in quantities sufficient for all, while promoting social progress in \r\nharmony with the environment, and supporting those institutions that respond \r\nto the noblest aspirations that human beings cherish throughout their lives. \r\nEven if only in terms strictly of a cost-benefit analysis, it is cheaper to \r\ndeal with social problems now. Dealing with them later involves paying the \r\nprice of social upheaval. We literally cannot afford to ignore that truth. \r\nWe have great pleasure in taking advantage of this opportunity to \r\nreaffirm our resolute support for the International Research and Training \r\nInstitute for the Advancement of Women. The Dominican Republic is profoundly \r\ncommitted to the success of that body. \r\nToday, the United Nations constitutes that ecumenical, common forum where \r\nwe set forth our ideas as we seek solutions intended to bring about a better \r\nlife in the world in which we live a world free from discrimination and \r\nwaste. It is our desire to see the work of this Organization revitalized so \r\nthat it may be able more effectively to do its job and live up to its \r\nobligations. We give it our fullest support, and we express our faith and \r\nhope in universal peace and harmony. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n98-100 \r\nMr. LUMBI OKONGO (Zaire) (interpretation from French): In \r\naddressing this Assembly for the first time, I should like, first, on behalf \r\nof my delegation and on my own behalf, to carry out the pleasant duty of \r\nconveying to Mr. Ganev of Bulgaria our most earnest and warmest \r\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of the Generaly Assembly at \r\nits forty-seventh session, and to assure him of our cooperation with a view to \r\nachieving a successful outcome. \r\nWe should like also to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved \r\ntribute to Mr. Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia for the deft and skilful manner \r\nin which he led the work of the last session. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n101 \r\n(Mr. Lumbi Okonoo. Zaire) \r\nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, we reiterate our \r\nmost earnest congratulations on the outstanding manner in which he has been \r\ndischarging his difficult responsibilities since he was elected head of our \r\nOrganization. \r\nWe also take this opportunity to welcome the positive and beneficial \r\ninfluence of the activities of our former Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who was able to give our Organization a new \r\ndynamism and brought it closer to the goals assigned to it by its founding \r\nfathers. \r\nOn behalf of Zaire, I welcome the new Member States that have joined the \r\nOrganization, thereby bringing us closer to its much-desired goal of \r\nuniversality. \r\nBut we are bound to note that the purposes of our Organization laid down \r\nin its Charter are far from being achieved, because in many places throughout \r\nthe world the universal peace that we so earnestly seek is still just an \r\nambition. Indeed, hotbeds of tension have been rekindled, thereby \r\njeopardizing international peace and security, which our Organization has a \r\nduty to guarantee. We earnestly appeal to all parties in conflict, wherever \r\nthey may be, to lay down their arms and exclude the word \"force\" from their \r\nvocabulary. \r\nIn this vein, we find a great deal of merit in the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\nreport, \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277), to the international community, in \r\nwhich we find valuable recommendations on preventive diplomacy, peacemaking \r\nand peace-keeping. \r\nWe believe that the Assembly should give the greatest attention to this \r\nanalysis. Zaire pledges its help in studying these ideas, so useful to our \r\nOrganization. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n102 \r\n(Mr. Lumbi Okonoo. Zaire) \r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s recommendations lead us to focus on a few of the \r\nmany areas of tension. \r\nThe Security Council meeting on violence in South Africa made it possible \r\nto avoid a break in the dialogue established within the Convention for a \r\nDemocratic South Africa (CODESA). We reiterate our appeal to all political \r\nforces to put an end to their antagonism so that negotiations for the \r\nestablishment of a representative government may resume. To this end, we \r\nstrongly urge the South African Government to use all necessary ways and means \r\nto put an end to extremist acts of all kinds that lead to violence. \r\nIn the Middle East, since the establishment of the Government resulting \r\nfrom the latest elections in Israel and the resumption of negotiations between \r\nthe parties concerned, we have reason for some hope. We Therefore urge all \r\nparties committed to the quest for an overall political solution that would \r\nlead to lasting peace in that region to continue along the path of dialogue. \r\nFor some years now we have witnessed considerable efforts by the United \r\nStates of America and the Russian Federation the Powers with the most \r\nsophisticated and most destructive weapons, whether nuclear, conventional, \r\nbiological or chemical drastically to reduce the number of such weapons, \r\nthereby helping to establish a new era in international politics and in peace \r\nand security for States and peoples. Zaire welcomes this most sincerely, and \r\nwe hope that other military Powers will follow their example. If they do, the \r\nsecond millennium, for which we are preparing so busily, will open up new \r\nprospects for humankind as a whole. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n103 \r\n(Mr. Lumbi Okongo. Zaire) \r\nToday, in a surge of world-wide solidarity, the developed countries \r\nliving in prosperity should help, in a spirit of true partnership, the \r\ncountries of the South to solve the problems related to underdevelopment, \r\nwhich have many complex causes. It is true that underdevelopment will not go \r\naway overnight simply because the prosperous countries of the North decide to \r\nmake available to third world countries financial resources resulting from \r\ncutbacks they may make in their military budgets; rather it will be ended by \r\nstrategies to do away with the dire poverty of the nations of Africa and other \r\nunderdeveloped countries. \r\nThat is why Zaire is convinced that a harmonious future for our planet \r\ndepends on peace, security and prosperity shared by all nations, both of the \r\nNorth and of the South. And that is why Zaire also believes that the Final \r\nDocument of the International Conference on the Relationship between \r\nDisarmament and Development should now be implemented in order to find the \r\nnecessary resources to solve the daunting problems our peoples face. \r\nIt is clear that the collective security aspects likely to create tension \r\nand conflict in the world are not only military, but also spring from the \r\nextreme impoverishment of our peoples, linked to high population growth rates \r\nand the debt burden. \r\nLooking at our ravaged economies, we believe that debt servicing must in \r\nno way hamstring our development efforts. Our countries\u0027 total external debt \r\nis constantly increasing, and has now reached more than $1.5 billion. Without \r\nany real readiness to cooperate on the part of the industrialized countries, \r\nand without considerable efforts devoted to the planning and establishment of \r\nappropriate ad hoc structures, there will be no hope of recovery for our \r\neconomies. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n104 \r\n(Mr. Lumbi Okonoo. Zaire! \r\nWe strongly hope that those devising strategic development policies for \r\nthe fourth decade will take into account the recommendations of the Economic \r\nCommission for Africa (ECA) resulting from the Conference of Ministers \r\nresponsible for economic development and planning, held in Addis Ababa from \r\n20 to 24 April of this year, which drew up guidelines for the years ahead. \r\nWe also hope that, in accordance with the New International Development \r\nStrategy for the 1990s, the United Nations and the international community \r\nwill support efforts aimed at the economic recovery of Africa, for the common \r\ngood of all humankind. \r\nZaire hails the effective measures to protect and improve the environment \r\nenvisaged in the Rio Conventions. Indeed, as we have vast areas of protected \r\nforests, we would appreciate acceptance by the international community of the \r\nidea of recompensing countries that set aside major forested areas with a view \r\nto protecting them from the ravages of humankind. \r\nZaire, whose vast expanses of tropical rainforest have given it the \r\nstatus of the planet\u0027s \"second lung\", after Amazonia, has for long been in the \r\nvanguard of environmental conservation. Our country has a major network of \r\nlinked national parks and reserves covering 8 per cent of our national \r\nterritory. Some of these nature reserves the oldest of which were \r\nestablished more than 75 years ago - protect the rarest of species, including \r\nthe okapi, the white rhinoceros and the gorilla. In the context of the \r\nConventions adopted in Rio de Janeiro, Zaire offers all these natural \r\nresources to the international community as a contribution to the common \r\nheritage of humankind. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n105 \r\n(Mr. Lumbi Okonoo, Zaire) \r\nTherefore, my country calls upon the international community, \r\nparticularly the developed countries, to ensure that additional resources are \r\nmade available for the effective implementation of Agenda 21 and the new \r\nConventions dealing with biodiversity and climate change. My delegation \r\nappeals to all countries to give massive support to Agenda 21 and its \r\naccompanying Conventions; it asks that they sign them and take all the \r\nnecessary steps to ratify them. We invite countries of the North that might \r\nstill be hesitant about adapting their future behaviour to the requirements of \r\nenvironmental conservation and protection to respond positively. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n106 \r\n(Mr. Lumbi Okongo. Zaire) \r\nIt is no secret to anyone that Zaire is today experiencing a deep \r\nmultisectoral crisis essentially attributable to the disastrous management of \r\nits human, financial and material resources. The readiness for change \r\nexpressed by our people as a whole triumphed on 24 April 1990 with the \r\nstatement delivered by the President of the Republic, which finally recognized \r\nthe need for democratic political reform. \r\nFollowing the example of other African countries, Zairians claimed and \r\nobtained the holding of a national sovereign conference. Opened in \r\nAugust 1991, that conference is taking place in an atmosphere whose tone was \r\nset, on the one hand, by the troubles of September 1991, which ruined the \r\ncountry\u0027s already reeling economy, and, on the other, by a succession of \r\npolitical crises spawned in the climate of distrust that existed between the \r\nestablished powers and the opposition. Suspended a number of times, the work \r\nof the national sovereign conference none the less has managed to continue to \r\nthis day because our people has spared no sacrifice to lend its full support \r\nto this forum. Because of this, the date of 16 February will live in our \r\nmemory. Thus, as I speak, the meetings of the national sovereign conference \r\nare about to culminate, more than a year after its opening, in the adoption of \r\ncommittee reports following the election of a Prime Minister and the \r\nestablishment of a transition Government. \r\nThe transition period will be managed by three institutions: the \r\nPresidency of the Republic, the Supreme Council of the Republic, and the \r\ntransition Government. As regards the transition Government, the national \r\nsovereign conference elected Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi Wa Mulumba as Prime \r\nMinister in the vote held last August. The transition Government pledges \r\nbefore international opinion to guide this period of transition in the calmest \r\nand most peaceful manner possible. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n107 \r\n(Mr. Lumbi Okongo. Zaire) \r\nThe essential, indeed overriding, goal of the transition remains the \r\nestablishment of a state based upon the rule of law. Welcoming the role \r\nplayed by the free press in the evolution of democracy in our country, the \r\nGovernment is determined to encourage and support the media so that they can \r\nplay their full role in all freedom. Moreover, the transition Government and \r\nthe Supreme Council of the Republic will establish the High Council for \r\nAudio-Visual Media, which will manage the official press agencies in the same \r\nspirit. The Government is also committed to fighting censorhip and to \r\npromoting freedom of the press in all its forms. \r\nThe establishment of a State based on the rule of law necessarily entails \r\nrespect for the rights of the individual. That is why the Government will \r\nwork in concert with the associations responsible for human rights issues. To \r\nthat end, they will be granted the civil status that has been hitherto denied \r\nthem, as well as being guaranteed access to the media and freedom of action \r\nthroughout our national territory. \r\nA top priority for the transition Government is laying the best possible \r\ngroundwork for the advent of a State based on the rule of law. To this end, \r\nZaire intends to hold free and democratic elections shortly. We therefore \r\nurgently appeal to the international community to help us organize these \r\nelections in the greatest possible transparency. \r\nIn conclusion, I should like to draw attention once again to the most \r\nalarming situation of our planet, a situation on which the entire \r\ninternational community is focused. My delegation is convinced that the \r\nUnited Nations is and will remain the ideal framework for the quest for \r\npeaceful solutions likely to defuse the hotbeds of tension that have developed \r\nin Africa, Asia and Europe. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n108 \r\n(Mr. Lumbi Okongo. Zaire) \r\nAs for Zaire, I have just recalled the great choices made by the national \r\nsovereign conference to provide the Zairian people with a new era of peace, \r\ndemocracy and economic development. In accordance with the United Nations \r\nCharter, Zaire announces its faith in the basic rights of the individual. To \r\nthat end, my country will spare no effort to ensure the victory of legality, \r\njustice, equity and equality. \r\nI wish the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly the fullest \r\nmeasure of success. \r\nMr. KIJINER (Marshall Islands): I take this opportunity warmly to \r\ncongratulate you. Sir, on your election to the presidency of the forty-seventh \r\nsession of the General Assembly. We know that we are in capable hand as we \r\nface the important tasks ahead of us. I should also like to express my \r\nappreciation to your predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, \r\nfor the distinguished manner in which he guided the General Assembly during \r\nthe last session. \r\nIt was one year ago that the General Assembly honoured the Republic of \r\nthe Marshall Islands by granting it membership in the United Nations. On this \r\nanniversary, as we reflect on our times, we note that a central feature of the \r\ninternational political landscape of the past several years has been the \r\nemergence or the re-emergence of the nationalities. \r\nIt is our grave responsibility to serve our nations during this \r\nchallenging period of transition and development. Throughout the world we are \r\nseeing the advent of self-government by nations. The sovereignty and dignity \r\nof indigenous peoples are coming to be recognized as the basis for effective \r\ngovernment. In the Marshall Islands, as in other developing countries \r\nthroughout the world, we have set high aspirations for our nation and we seek \r\nexpanded opportunities for our people. Our children will no longer be denied \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n109-110 \r\n(Mr. Kiiiner. Marshall Islands) \r\nachievement of their potential because of the time and place into which they \r\nwere born. They will be the hope and the pride of our nation, and our future. \r\nWe are grateful to the United Nations for its steadfast commitment to \r\nfostering the self-government and self-determination of peoples. For many \r\npeoples, it has been a long time coming. \r\nLike so many countries, large and small, the Marshall Islands was for \r\nfour and a half decades relegated to one camp of the great cold-war struggle. \r\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, the residents of Bikini \r\nand Enewetak Atolls in the Northern Marshall Islands were relocated from their \r\nancestral homes so that the United States Government could conduct an \r\nextensive and widely publicized programme of testing atomic and nuclear \r\nweapons. Even though the testing programme was discontinued in the late \r\n1950s, our Government and people are still coming to terms with its effects on \r\nour health and way of life. We have many good reasons to applaud the end of \r\nthe cold war. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n111 \r\n(Mr. Kiiiner. Marshall Island.) \r\nThe breakdown of the two contending camps has left a world in which we \r\ncan no longer conveniently apply the simple classification of nations into the \r\nEastern bloc or the Western block. It is a time fraught with uncertainty and \r\nrisk, but it is also a time for rethinking our concepts of government and its \r\nrelation to individual citizens. And with this rethinking we must see that \r\ngreater responsibilities are opened to mankind. \r\nWe are finding that the expediencies that once worked in the cold war \r\ncentres of power are too broad, too large in scale, too impersonal, for the \r\nsmaller nations. Development is now taking place on a more human scale. The \r\ngrowth of nations is providing the context for human ingenuity to assert \r\nitself with fewer restraints. The progress of the past decade has resulted in \r\na greater portion of mankind than ever before living in situations of \r\npolitical and economic freedom. Increasingly, the human spirit has been able \r\nto soar unfettered by restraints and regulations imposed by authorities too \r\ndistant from individuals\u0027 circumstances. \r\nIn a setting of liberty, the individual is empowered to advance to the \r\nextent of his ability. For many years teachers in the Marshall Islands have \r\nsought to implement the wise insight of Marcus Aurelius: \r\n\"Give a man a fish and you have fed him for a day. Teach a man to fish \r\nand you have fed him for ever.\" \r\nSome of our teachers have even convinced themselves that this is Marshallese \r\nfolk wisdom! But at least they recognize that the most effective help is \r\nself-help. \r\nThe exchange of ideas and the reduction of trade barriers have served to \r\ndraw mankind together. People throughout the world are now cooperating in the \r\ndevelopmental process. In no nation do people live in the isolation that our \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n112 \r\n(Mr. Kiiiner. Marshall Islands) \r\nancestors did only a century ago and that some people endured until the end \r\nof the cold war. But, in the face of modernization, the people and places of \r\nthe world have retained their particular attributes, and these are now giving \r\nforce and cohesion to their national characters. \r\nThe past year has seen the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. At this \r\nhistoric gathering the nations of the world agreed to pursue their \r\ndevelopmental goals in a manner that will sustain the ecological diversity of \r\nour planet. We in the Marshall Islands, living on low-lying coral atolls and \r\nislands, have been following with great interest the scientific debate over \r\nglobal warming. The same careful approach that we have applied to evaluating \r\nthe impact of nuclear testing in our islands is also being applied to the \r\npossible dangers of a rise in sea level. In this regard, I am pleased to \r\nreiterate the call that President Amata Kabua of the Marshall Islands made at \r\nthe Rio Summit for the United Nations to convene a follow-up Earth Summit in \r\n1995, coinciding with the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. \r\nIf global warming endangers certain regions and certain modes of life, we \r\nhave to confirm the risks and inform our citizens about them. An environment \r\nat risk will be a significant constraint for the developing nations in the \r\nlate twentieth century. Nevertheless, our concern for environmental quality \r\nneed not put a halt to the developmental process. Instead, it will be part of \r\nthe overall situation to which individuals will respond with creativity and \r\nproductivity. \r\nWith the assistance of the United Nations, the people of our countries \r\nwill continue to benefit from the international structure of trade, cultural \r\nexchanges, environmental studies and the resolution of disputes. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n113 \r\n(Mr. Kiiiner. Marshall Islands) \r\nThe heart of the United Nations consists of the many Member \r\nnation-States. The rich mix of nationalities is certainly complicating the \r\nmap of the world. Our challenge is to find collective benefit in this \r\ndiversity. \r\nAs a primary obligation, of course, we must meet basic human needs that \r\nare beyond local capabilities: collectively, we can help feed the starving \r\nrefugees of Somalia; we can commit our manpower and financial resources to \r\nhelp bring peace to the Middle East and in the Balkan States; we can provide \r\nemergency assistance to the victims of natural disasters; we can continue to \r\nwork towards the eradication of the great plagues. In these situations, where \r\nthe human need is greatest, the United Nations is admirably serving its \r\npurposes. In addition, the techniques and processes made available by the \r\nagencies of the United Nations have helped provide our citizens with security \r\nand basic public services. \r\nOn the other hand, the preservation of cultural diversity, and probably \r\nthe preservation of environmental diversity, will require the direct \r\ncommitment of nations and individuals. In an era of national consciousness, \r\nmost matters of public policy, even those with international consequences, are \r\ngoing to be worked out at the national level - and frequently locally and \r\nindividually. \r\nLet us celebrate the diverse nationalities, and do everything in our \r\npower to nurture our peoples and enable them to lead lives that are full and \r\ncontented and peaceful. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n114-115 \r\nMr. GASSYMOV (Azerbaijan) (interpretation from Russian): Anyone who \r\nhas spoken from this rostrum will probably understand what my feelings are at \r\nthis moment: there is both a feeling of pride in my people and my country, \r\nwhich have now set out along the road of independent development a right \r\nthat does not come so easily and a sense of enormous responsibility for \r\nevery word I say, for my words will be addressed to the whole world. And I \r\nhope they will be heard! \r\nAll of us who have gathered here in this highly respected international \r\nforum, whatever our natural objective differences may be, have in common a \r\nsingle goal, that of achieving peace and security, and a single desire, to \r\nsolve existing problems and prevent new ones from arising. Through our \r\nunderstanding that the world is interdependent in all its aspects, we have \r\ncome to realize our necessary interest in overcoming difficulties, and that \r\ncommon interest has become the foundation of this transitional stage on the \r\nroad towards the establishment of a new world order. \r\nAll of us, I think, have already got over the euphoria of expecting rapid \r\nchanges that were about to take possession of a world liberated from the \r\nchains of the cold war, and we have come to understand the depth of the \r\nproblems confronting a human race which has gone to the limit in its search \r\nfor new paths to development. Nobody is expecting easy victories. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n116 \r\n(Mr. Gassymov. Azerbaijan \r\nThe situation in the world is undergoing fundamental and sometimes \r\ndrastic changes. The military, political and economic confrontation between \r\nthe two systems which had for a long time determined the balance of power in \r\nthe world has come to an end with the collapse of one of them. What this has \r\nactually done is to destroy the foundation of international security, which \r\nhad until then been intimidation and deterrence through parity of forces. \r\nA new system of world security must be created, one oriented on the new \r\npoles of power, the new roles of the super-Powers, new threats, new ways of \r\nwaging war and new types of forces. The probability of a nuclear war has been \r\nreduced almost to zero, but the element of chance has increased; there are no \r\nsafeguards against the occurrence of regional wars or against the unforeseen \r\nactions of State leaders or the consequences of those actions. These are all \r\nmatters of serious concern to the Azerbaijani Republic, for no State can be \r\nsecure on its own. \r\nAzerbaijan has no nuclear weapons on its soil and is not participating \r\ndirectly in the process of nuclear disarmament. Nevertheless, the Azerbaijani \r\nRepublic is making its contribution by acceding to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We are optimistic as a result of the \r\nimplementation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, to which \r\nAzerbaijan, along with other European States, has become a party. However, \r\ndespite the achievements and successes of the disarmament process, military \r\nexpenditures are, as before, absorbing a significant portion of State budgets \r\nat a time when such funds could be directed towards economic development. \r\nArms stockpiling is, as before, a threat to security. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n117 \r\n(Mr. Gassvmov. Azerbaijan) \r\nOne of the most important elements in military security is the openness \r\nor transparency of military programmes and activities. As a member of the \r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), my country is \r\nparticipating in the development of this process. \r\nThe move towards direct cooperation in the form of wide-ranging and \r\nintensive multilateral exchanges of information on military budgets and \r\nnumbers, production levels, research, development and modernization programmes \r\nand weapons deployment and delivery plans seems to be a desirable one. Such \r\nopenness will create an atmosphere of trust, make it easier to predict \r\ndevelopments in the overall security situation, bolster stability and reduce \r\nthe risk of war. \r\nDuring the long years of the East-West conflict it was usual for one side \r\nto arm the other\u0027s enemies. Today, when the threat of confrontation along \r\nEast-West lines has gone, this so-called foreign-policy wisdom is likely to \r\nprove a significant danger to us all. Weapons proliferation is a serious \r\nchallenge to international security and requires the world community to take \r\nactive steps in order to ensure that it is limited and effectively controlled. \r\nArms shipments, which are fraught with a fundamental potential for \r\ndanger, are becoming a real factor capable of producing destructive effects on \r\nthe situation in so-called hot spots. I hardly need explain how much trouble \r\nAzerbaijan has been caused by the weapons, including foreign-made weapons, \r\nbeing supplied, within Azerbaijani territory, by Armenian forces. We must \r\nencourage restraint on the part of arms suppliers; this will, of course, \r\nentail political difficulties. Limits could be placed on exports of arms to a \r\nparticular country or region. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n118 \r\n(Mr. Gassvmov. Azerbaijan) \r\nIt should be normal practice to declare arms transfers and to observe \r\nestablished limits, and the political complexion of the recipient must also be \r\ntaken into account. The United Nations Register of conventional arms \r\ntransfers will undoubtedly also play an important role in this regard. \r\nGiven the attempts by certain countries to obtain weapons covertly, I \r\nwould like to emphasize the extreme importance of having access to \r\nintelligence data on weapons proliferation and of observing suspicious regions \r\nand carrying out unannounced inspections there. In addition to the direct \r\neffects, these would increase States\u0027 confidence in the weapons \r\nnon-proliferation regime. I believe that it would be appropriate to make \r\nefforts to establish subregional restraint regimes; this is particularly \r\nurgent for the multiplicity of hot spots which are appearing against the \r\nbackground of a minimal military threat on a Europe-wide scale. Subregional \r\nrestraint could include reducing military force levels in limited \r\ngeographically remote areas. Thereafter such regimes could lay the groundwork \r\nfor the demilitarization of whole regions. Azerbaijan has already proposed \r\nthis concept for the Transcaucasian region. \r\nThe vacuum left by the disappearance of the Soviet Union from the \r\nmilitary and political map of the world threatened to bring global disaster. \r\nHowever, we have survived that difficult period. In its death throes, the \r\nSoviet Union fortunately disintegrated; new sovereign States arose from its \r\nruins and declared for all to hear that they were determined to join the \r\ncommunity of democratic States based on law and with market economies. The \r\nUnited States of America and Russia, the two super-Powers, as they are still \r\nbeing called, have started to cooperate in the name of their common interests. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n119 \r\n(Mr. Gassvmov. Azerbaijan) \r\nWorld developments of the last few years do indeed show that the \r\ndemocratic sphere is expanding. More and more countries want to be \r\ndemocratic, and regimes of other kinds are facing more and more difficulties. \r\nOf course, the development of democracy is a very difficult process whose \r\nultimate goal, the establishment of an ideal system, is difficult to achieve; \r\nhowever, we can and must move forward towards that goal, by consolidating \r\ndemocratic values and institutions. And the core of the issue here is not \r\nmerely adherence to ideals but the political and socio-economic rightness of \r\nthe democratic system, whose effectiveness will very soon, I hope, become \r\napparent in my country as well. \r\nThere is in science a principle called dynamic evolutionary stability, \r\naccording to which the elements of a system obey the same laws and move in the \r\nsame direction. Any member of the system which tries to move in a direction \r\ndifferent from the general trend is thrown out. And so it is in life. One \r\ncannot enter the world system and then follow a different programme and not \r\nobserve the same rules as everybody else. Of course, the euphoria of national \r\nindependence may prompt its own \"special\" path, but we know from history how \r\nsuch experiments end. \r\nWhat is the substance of the Azerbaijani Republic\u0027s national \r\nindependence? Today new people have taken the helm, people free of the dogmas \r\nof the communist past, prepared to see the world as it is, without ideological \r\nmasks, and striving for cooperation on the basis of common human values. \r\nThese people have inherited the burdensome legacy of a repressive State which \r\ngoverned an obedient society, but that has only made their resolve to overcome \r\nit that much stronger. Our need for capable authorities which would see as \r\ntheir principal purpose the creation of the conditions for stimulating \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n120 \r\n(Mr. Gassvmov. Azerbaijan) \r\ninitiative and independence, which would act in the interests of the \r\nindividual and would be rooted in the institution of citizenship, was forged \r\nin suffering. Our State policy is based on the interrelationship between the \r\nfreedom and well-being of the individual and the security and prosperity of \r\nthe State. Today the Government of the Azerbaijani Republic is facing the \r\ncomplex task of establishing legislative, political and socio-economic \r\nsafeguards for the irreversibility of the democratic process. \r\nNewly independent States encounter a multitude of political, economic and \r\nsocial problems on their way to establishing themselves. They must face the \r\ndifficult task of overcoming those problems within a cruelly short time-limit \r\nset by life itself. However, even that punishing pace at which the democratic \r\nauthorities chosen by the people must act is intensified by threats and \r\nchallenges of a different order which undermine States that are not yet \r\nstanding on their own feet. I have in mind here what are called inter-ethnic \r\nconflicts, which are more political than ethnic in nature. \r\nThere are no limits to the energy of a nation, which has become one of \r\nthe driving forces of the development of mankind in the twentieth century. \r\nThe explosive power of the energy of a national ego released from the fetters \r\nof many years of repression destroys the apparently unshakeable citadels of \r\ntotalitarian regimes and opens up new prospects for people. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n121 \r\n(Mr. Gassvmov. Azerbaijan) \r\nHowever if that same power is placed at the service of an ugly, overblown \r\nnationalistic idea, it turns a people onto the path of war and drives it to \r\naggression and expansion against another people chosen as its victim. \r\nAn example of the first kind of national idea is the disintegration of \r\nthat conglomeration of nations known as the USSR. An example of the \r\nsecond and a most accurate one - is the agression of Armenia against \r\nAzerbaijan. \r\nTo any action there is an opposite reaction. An aggressor dooms himself \r\nfrom the outset to failure, for he arouses against himself a people\u0027s natural \r\nreaction of self-defence, a force many times greater than the irrational force \r\nof aggression. Prosperity gained at another\u0027s expense cannot be long-lasting, \r\neven if it sometimes seems so. \r\nWhat is the result? Death and destruction, masses of destitute people on \r\nboth sides, relations between States made difficult or broken off these are \r\nreflected many times in all spheres of human activity and threaten to escalate \r\nto new and more dangerous levels, involving other States and altering the \r\nregional or even the world balance. There is only one alternative: to end \r\nthe aggression, if not voluntarily, then under the pressure of counter-force. \r\nAggression must not go unpunished. Aggressors must be stopped. \r\nThe importance of the international community\u0027s position on this issue \r\ncannot be overestimated. A timely, principled reaction by the international \r\norganizations, first and foremost by the United Nations and CSCE, is one of \r\nthe guarantees that the required result will be achieved - that the aggression \r\nwill be eliminated and therefore thousands of lives saved and that the \r\nconditions for States to develop peacefully will be established. The key idea \r\nthat breaches of the peace are inadmissible is based on the fact that each \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n122 \r\n(Mr. Gassvmov. Azerbaijan) \r\nState bears a high responsibility to the world community, and it presupposes a \r\nharmonization of national interests with the interests of all mankind. \r\nNo one can dispute the right of a nation to the free choice of its path \r\nof development, but there are no rights without duties, and this is also true \r\nof nations, whose freedom of choice is controlled by their interrelationships \r\nwith the world, as parts of the whole. Freedom does not mean irresponsibility. \r\nViolence of any kind, whatever its motivation or justification, is \r\ninadmissible. In our time the kind of nationalism that has nothing in common \r\nwith national self-awareness has come close to being the greatest wellspring \r\nof violence. Sooner or later, that kind of nationalism finds the framework \r\nimposed on it by history constricting, and it starts to break out, violating \r\nother peoples\u0027 borders and infringing upon other peoples\u0027 interests. \r\nToday, having emerged from an ideologically divided world, we are facing \r\nthe danger of dismemberment based on nationalistic grounds which feed the \r\npolitics of separatism. The fact that the legal norms governing the right of \r\npeoples to self-determination, and even the meaning of the term, have not been \r\nfully worked out, either in domestic or in international law, has opened the \r\ndoor to widespread speculation on the subject on pseudo-democratic grounds, \r\nwhich are essentially a cover for forces harbouring plans to seize territory. \r\nWe must make it clear, first of all, that the right of peoples to \r\nself-determination can be exercised solely by peaceful means; secondly, that \r\nthe possessor of that right can be only a nation, not a national minority or \r\nan ethnic group; thirdly, that a people exercising its right to \r\nself-determination must not violate another people\u0027s right, its sovereignty or \r\nthe integrity of its State. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n123 \r\n(Mr. Gassvmov. Azerbaijan) \r\nMaking the discussion of the foregoing more concrete by projecting these \r\nconclusions onto the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, I am compelled to say the \r\nfollowing. \r\nThe Republic of Armenia, having set the dismemberment of the Azerbaijani \r\nState and the seizure of its territories as the goal of its State policy, \r\ninitiated the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, an inseparable part of Azerbaijan, \r\nunder cover of a demand for the right to self-determination for the Armenian \r\npopulation of that Azerbaijani region, whose borders, incidentally, have not \r\nbeen defined. There are no internal borders in the unitary Azerbaijani \r\nState. The region was split off administratively during the Stalin era, and \r\nit is the Armenian side that is so fervently demanding the elimination of the \r\nlegacy of that time. \r\nI think there is no need to comment on the ill-intentioned substitution \r\nof the concept of \"people\" for that of \"national minority\". The Armenian \r\npeople has already exercised its historic right to self-determination within \r\nthe borders of the Republic of Armenia. With regard to the Armenian national \r\nminority which lives in Azerbaijan and has autonomy, the Azerbaijani Republic \r\nhas repeatedly stated its readiness to guarantee that minority\u0027s rights in \r\naccordance with international norms, while justifiably expecting the Republic \r\nof Armenia to take suitable steps in respect of the Azerbaijani community \r\nwhich has lived for centuries in the territory of the present-day Republic of \r\nArmenia but has had no rights whatsoever and which, alas, has now been forced \r\nout of Armenia into Azerbaijan. \r\nThe conflict, which is now a matter of concern to the world community, \r\nbegan with a blatant violation of the Azerbaijani Republic\u0027s sovereignty by \r\nArmenian separatists who, without holding any discussions with the Government \r\nof Azerbaijan, proclaimed their secession from the Azerbaijani Republic. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n124 \r\n(Mr. Gassvmov. Azerbaijan) \r\nThey were supported by the Republic of Armenia, whose Parliament, in 1989, \r\nissued decrees on the unification of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia, on \r\nincluding the budget of Nagorno-Karabakh in the Armenian budget and on the \r\nelection of deputies from Nagorno-Karabakh to the Parliament of Armenia. \r\nThose decrees have not been annulled to this day and are in violation of the \r\nnorms of international law. Such political infringements by the Republic of \r\nArmenia on Azerbaijan\u0027s sovereignty have since been backed up with practical \r\nmeasures aimed at implementing Armenia\u0027s declared plans to annex Azerbaijani \r\nterritory. \r\nThe use of force is, of course, unacceptable in settling disputes. Yet \r\nthe actions of the Republic of Armenia, which initially took the form of \r\ncovert aggression through the infiltration of separatists and terrorist gangs \r\nand delivering arms into Azerbaijan and which later turned into open \r\naggression in the form of a direct armed incursion into Azerbaijan, the \r\nseizure of the city of Shusha and the Lachin district and the establishment of \r\na land corridor joining occupied Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia, have naturally \r\nprompted a response from the armed forces of the Azerbaijani Government, which \r\nhas the right and the duty to defend the interests of its citizens and its \r\nState, over 10 per cent of whose territory is now under Armenian occupation. \r\nRenouncing the use of force under these conditions could not prevent \r\nbloodshed. Inaction on the part of the Government would have provoked a \r\nmovement from below, with the formation of self-defence forces whose actions \r\nwould be spontaneous and therefore might have become uncontrollable. The \r\nAzerbaijani Republic, which has used military force only within its own \r\nfrontiers and at a controlled level, the miminum level necessary to protect \r\nits sovereignty, has, from the very beginning of the conflict, called on the \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n125 \r\n(Mr. Gassvmov. Azerbaijan) \r\nopposing side to cease hostilities and to settle existing problems at the \r\nnegotiating table. It is continuing today to confirm its readiness for \r\npeaceful dialogue by taking specific measures aimed at reaching a compromise. \r\nHowever, Azerbaijan\u0027s efforts were met each time with silence on the part of \r\nthe Republic of Armenia, which continues to make demands that are contrary to \r\ninternational law. One can hardly expect political leaders who rose to power \r\non a wave of ideas of nationalism and the establishment of a Greater Armenia \r\nto abandon those positions, because it would mean their political death. But \r\nholding that line will lead to a catastrophe incomparably greater than the \r\ndisappearance of the politicians from the arena. \r\nThe present leadership of the Republic of Armenia should realize that the \r\npath they have chosen is a deadly one; Armenia will never be a democratic \r\nState while it carries the burden of this conflict. Democracy cannot be built \r\non a foundation of nationalism, on flouting laws, on bloodshed and suffering. \r\nThis whole train of events gives us solid grounds for viewing Armenia\u0027s \r\nposition with regard to peaceful settlement and international mediation merely \r\nas an attempt to gain time for consolidation in the Azerbaijani territories \r\nArmenia has forcibly seized, so that it can subsequently obtain agreement on a \r\npolitical solution from a position of fait accompli. \r\nBut there is no alternative to a peaceful settlement. Decisive steps \r\nmust be taken to clear the obstacles from the road to peace. A necessary \r\ncondition for this is the withdrawal of Armenian armed formations from \r\nAzerbaijan, since that would establish a real foundation for a stable \r\ncease-fire under international supervision, for the return of refugees to \r\ntheir homes and the normalization of life in the war-torn areas, including \r\nsafeguards for the rights of the Armenian national minority living in \r\nAzerbaijan. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n125(a-z) \r\n(Mr. Gassvmov. Azerbaijan) \r\nDespite all the complications and obstacles, the peaceful settlement \r\nprocess initiated by CSCE and followed up by CSCE\u0027s Minsk Group under the \r\nchairmanship of Mr. Rafaelli, for whose efforts I am sincerely grateful, both \r\nto him personally and to the Government of Italy, must achieve the desired \r\nresult: an end to the aggression and the senseless bloodshed, the liberation \r\nof occupied Azerbaijani areas, the development of a peaceful dialogue between \r\nthe two States and the solution of existing internal problems on a reciprocal \r\nbasis. The national minorities in Armenia and Azerbaijan must become not \r\npawns in a dispute but guarantees of each other\u0027s security and of respect for \r\neach other\u0027s interests, and, in the future, a bridge for cooperation. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n126 \r\n(Mr. Gassvmov. Azerbaijan) \r\nI hold this optimic view because I have faith in the reasonableness of \r\ntwo peoples and two States that have lived side by side for centuries and \r\nwhose history has earned them the right to peace, prosperity and \r\ngood-neighbourly relations. I hope that the Republic of Armenia will come to \r\nrealize the importance of such concepts as good neighbours, friendship and \r\nmutual assistance, which have deep roots in our region. \r\nThe concrete example of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict enables us to \r\ndraw certain conclusions that are related and applicable to other regional \r\nconflicts similar in nature to the one I have mentioned. The world we live in \r\nis very fragile; thus our approach to the principles governing global \r\ncoexistence, hammered out by the experience of human civilization, should be \r\nvery cautious. Those principles include, first of all, the sovereignty of \r\nStates, their territorial integrity and the inviolability of their borders; \r\nthey also include the inadmissibility of securing one\u0027s interests at the \r\nexpense of those of others. Such a course cannot bring independence, \r\ndemocracy or prosperity to any State. Everything in the world is interrelated. \r\nThe words spoken and the actions taken by some politicians in defence of \r\nhuman rights, national minorities, and nationhood can sometimes threaten the \r\nmost fundamental right - the right to life. When blood is being shed, it is \r\npointless to talk about the rights of national minorities. I have said it \r\nbefore and now say it again: The sovereignty of the State begins with the \r\nsovereignty of the individual. Respect for human rights is not part of a \r\nState\u0027s internal affairs but its obligation. The safeguarding of rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms is the main guarantee of a State\u0027s prosperous \r\ndevelopment. Returning to the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, I must point out \r\nthat our approach is based precisely on this understanding and that Armenians \r\nliving in Azerbaijan are just as much citizens of this State as Azerbaijanis, \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n127 \r\n(Mr. Gassvmov. Azerbaijan) \r\nRussians, Jews, Kurds, Lezghians, Talishes or Poles. But there are no rights \r\nwithout obligations. The State is the guarantor of individual freedom; the \r\nindividual is the guarantor of the State\u0027s security. \r\nThe defence of human rights - and of the rights of national minorities as \r\npart of those rights cannot be implemented to the detriment of State \r\nsovereignty. External influence and interference are sometimes hard to \r\ndistinguish, and crossing the fine line that separates them can lead to \r\ndisaster. Sometimes the non-use of external force can have great benefits. \r\nProblems of this kind have various political, social, and economic causes, and \r\nsometimes a State trying to solve the problem cannot instantly unravel the \r\ntangle of causes and effects. It is a lengthy process requiring a delicate \r\napproach in which the underlying principle must be: \"Do no harm\". In such \r\ncircumstances a State has the right to count on the assistance and experience \r\nof the world community. Working to improve the State from within will have \r\nmore effect than pressure from without. \r\nEvery State has its share of responsibility to the outside world, \r\nexpressed as its duty to observe accepted norms and obligations. A question \r\nof practical interest today is that of the further elaboration in \r\ninternational law of the principle of sovereignty, with due regard for the \r\nincreased international responsibility of States. Bringing national \r\nlegislation into conformity with international law, a process which creates \r\nthe necessary regimes of rights and freedoms of the individual, is of the \r\ngreatest importance in this context. Such a process has already been \r\ninitiated in Azerbaijan. The priority of international legal norms over \r\nnational ones is enshrined in the constitutional act of State independence of \r\n18 October 1991. To conclude this subject, I should like to point out that \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n128 \r\n(Mr. Gassyraov. Azerbaijan) \r\nour common progress in that direction must emphasize the harmonization of the \r\ninterests of mankind and national interests. \r\nOne of the main factors for stability in society, particularly during a \r\ntransitional period, serving in a sense as a guarantee of the irreversibility \r\nof democratic reforms, is a healthy and developed economy. Unfortunately, I \r\nmust state that today the economy of Azerbaijan has fallen on hard times. The \r\nlegacy of the Soviet past and the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict are taking \r\ntheir toll. \r\nThe failure of the centralized planning system further strengthened our \r\nconfidence in the viability of the market economy. The Parliament and \r\nGovernment of the Republic, committed to rapid reform, are working hard for \r\nthe legislative and programmed introduction of economic changes that should \r\naccelerate the process of market formation and integrating Azerbaijan into the \r\nworld economy on an equitable and mutually beneficial footing. \r\nThe world economy has not yet succeeded in surmounting a number of \r\nobstacles, foremost among which, to my mind, is the disproportion in economic \r\ndevelopment. It is believed that, in spite of all the problems of the world \r\neconomy, whose number increased sharply with the collapse of the Soviet \r\nsystem, the end of the ideological confrontation between the two poles of \r\npower has given a positive impetus to the formulation of new approaches in the \r\ndeveloped world towards the problems of developing countries. \r\nParticipation in international economic organizations and United Nations \r\neconomic agencies, with the concomitant opening of a wide range of \r\npossibilities for multilateral economic cooperation, is a matter of high \r\npriority for Azerbaijan. Definite hopes for instituting economic reforms in \r\nAzerbaijan are being placed in financial assistance and consultative technical \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n129 \r\n(Mr. Gassymov. Azerbaijan) \r\nassistance that could be provided under special programmes. The United \r\nNations, an office of which is to be opened at Baku in the near future, should \r\nplay an active role in this. \r\nHowever, I should like to express my regret concerning the position of \r\ncertain States in whose policy the provision of assistance to young democratic \r\nStates is linked to particular political objectives that are, in our view, of \r\na subjective nature. Refusal to provide assistance may not only fail to \r\npromote the development of the reform process but also create new problems for \r\nthe establishment of democracy in young States. The consequences of such \r\nill-considered steps could be far more serious than the reasons that motivated \r\nthe refusal. \r\nThe warfare initiated by the Republic of Armenia against Azerbaijan has \r\ncreated a social tragedy in my country. About 500,000 Azerbaijanis have been \r\ndeprived of the basic necessities of life; 230,000 of them were expelled from \r\nthe areas of Armenia in which they had historically resided, and the rest have \r\nbecome refugees as a result of Armenia\u0027s direct aggression against \r\nAzerbaijan. Our Government has encountered enormous difficulties in meeting \r\ntheir needs. I should like to express my hope that the United Nations will \r\nnot leave Azerbaijan to deal with this disaster alone and that it will provide \r\nall possible assistance. \r\nThe ecological situation, which has been gradually deteriorating \r\nthroughout the world, is becoming the greatest threat of all. Nature is \r\ncalling attention to its problems with increasing urgency through new \r\nenvironmental disasters and tragedies. The problem of structural reform of \r\nthe global economy on a basis that is environmentally sound still remains \r\nunsolved. The contribution of the United Nations in this field - demonstrated \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n130 \r\n(Mr. Gassvmov. Azerbaijan) \r\ninter alia in the convening of the Conference on Environment and Development \r\ndeserves particular mention here. That Conference was a valuable example of \r\ncollective efforts to solve humanity\u0027s problems. \r\nMy country cannot boast of a favourable ecological situation. The \r\ncondition of the Caspian Sea is tragic, showing the effect of all the ills of \r\na planned economy and of its consumption-oriented attitude towards nature. We \r\nfirmly intend to make every effort to save this unique natural ecosystem, and \r\nwe hope that our efforts will be supported by assistance from the world \r\ncommunity. \r\nThe primary mechanism of world development at present is international \r\ncooperation. I believe that we can solve our problems only in that context. \r\nI am also convinced that the process of strengthening cooperation will \r\ncontinue to evolve. Naturally, such evolution is directly related to the \r\ngrowing importance and prestige of the United Nations. Our Organization has a \r\nspecial role in international relations, which are undergoing radical \r\nchanges. The United Nations has been, is and always will be the world forum \r\nin matters of justice and law, the stronghold of the civilized norms of life \r\nand the highest authority in the settlement of international disputes. The \r\ngrowing effectiveness of the Organization as a factor for security, stability \r\nand cooperation illustrates that fact. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n131 \r\n(Mr. Gassymov. Azerbaijan) \r\nNew conditions and changes in the world situation require readjustments, \r\nincluding structural ones. Special attention should be given to the \r\ndevelopment of structures and means for preventive diplomacy, early warning of \r\ncrisis situations and the improvement of means for averting acts of \r\naggression. The United Nations should have the capacity to protect its Member \r\nStates more decisively and effectively from violations of their sovereignty, \r\ntaking action up to and including enforcement measures against the aggressor. \r\nCooperation with regional organizations on the basis of mutual support will, I \r\nbelieve, promote greater effectiveness of United Nations peace-keeping and \r\npeacemaking activities. United Nations structures should be brought as close \r\nas possible to the problems which the Organization intends to resolve. \r\nEverything should serve to increase the efficiency of United Nations \r\nactivities as a mechanism for security and cooperation. \r\nI am firmly convinced that the ship of the United Nations, guided by the \r\nstrong hand of its captain, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, a man of wisdom and \r\ndecisiveness as befits a true captain, will keep to the necessary course, the \r\nonly true course, and, as the flagship of the world community, carry it to the \r\nshores of peace and prosperity. \r\nThe forty-sixth session of the General Assembly was significant for the \r\nAzerbaijani Republic, when it was admitted as a Member of the United Nations. \r\nI take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to the President of \r\nthe Assembly at its forty-sixth session, Mr. Samir Shihabi, for his \r\ncontribution to our common cause and especially for his sensitivity and warmth \r\ntowards the new Members of the Organization. \r\nI hope that the current, forty-seventh session, under the presidency of \r\nMr. Stoyan Ganev, will bring us closer to our common goals. I wish Mr. Ganev \r\nsuccess in that position of responsibility. May every day of this session be \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n132 \r\n(Mr. Gassvmov. Azerbaijan) \r\na day of constructive solutions of our common problems. May new difficulties \r\nwhich, alas, life will always throw in our way not weaken our faith, nor \r\ndiscourage us on our long and thorny path. We conquer the road as we walk \r\nalong it. \r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): I shall now call on \r\nthose representatives who wish to speak in exercise of the right of reply. \r\nMay I remind members that, in accordance with General Assembly decision \r\n34/401, statements in exercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes \r\nfor the first intervention and to five minutes for the second, and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats. \r\nMr. MALIK (Iraq) (interpretation from Arabic): I should like to \r\nextend my apologies to you. Sir, and to members for speaking at this late \r\nhour. \r\nA short while ago, the Foreign Minister of Kuwait spoke of certain \r\n•elements of Security Council resolution 687 (1991), claiming that Iraq has not \r\n, implemented them. I should like to refute all his charges one by one in order \r\nt to put the facts before the General Assembly. \r\nFirst, Iraq has fully cooperated with the International Committee of the \r\n, Red Cross (ICRC), the United Nations, and the League of Arab States in making \r\nj available all information necessary to establish the facts with regard to the \r\n,, issue of missing persons that has been exploited against Iraq for political \r\nand inhuman purposes. Iraq has completely discharged its obligations under \r\nparagraphs 30 and 31 of resolution 687 (1991). We have allowed the Red Cross \r\nto visit all prisons and places of detention in order to investigate the \r\nsituation with regard to the so-called missing persons, without any \r\nrestrictions or hindrance. We have also published, several times, in our \r\nil \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n133 \r\n(Mr. Malik. Irag) \r\nlocal newspapers lists of the names of those missing persons. I should like \r\nto mention here that the Kuwaiti authorities have presented seven \r\ncontradictory lists of those missing persons, each of which gave a different \r\nnumber of missing persons. Any fair observer of this whole issue will easily \r\nunderstand that Kuwait and its allies are exploiting the issue without \r\njustification. \r\nSecondly, the representative of Iraq has participated in the meetings of \r\nthe first five sessions of the Boundary Commission during the period from \r\nMay 1991 through April 1992. He did not participate in the sixth session held \r\nin July 1992 for very important and substantive reasons, among which was the \r\nfact that the Commission\u0027s decisions have consistently shown a strong \r\npolitical bias harmful to Iraq\u0027s interests, namely depriving Iraq of its \r\nrights, damaging its vital interests and creating a situation of instability \r\nin the region, in addition to the procedural excesses of that Commission. It \r\nis to be noted, however, that non-participation of Iraq\u0027s representative has \r\nnot obstructed the Commission\u0027s work. \r\nThirdly, the process of restoring property has been proceeding normally \r\nwith the participation of the Secretary-General\u0027s assistant, Mr. Foran, who \r\nhas repeatedly commended the cooperation of the Iraqi authorities in that \r\nregard. \r\nFourthly, from the outset, Iraqi cooperation with the United Nations \r\ndelegation in the implementation of Security Council resolutions 706 (1991) \r\nand 712 (1991) has been evident. Yet, whenever the two parties are on the \r\nverge of reaching an agreement, the representatives of Western States in the \r\nSecurity Council have set up obstacles and imposed unjust political conditions \r\nthat threaten Iraq\u0027s sovereignty. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n134-135 \r\n(Mr. Malik. Iraq) \r\nFifthly, quite obviously, Iraq is cooperating with the Special Commission \r\non the destruction of weapons of mass destruction. Ballistic missiles have \r\nbeen destroyed, and Mr. Ziffero, the Chairman of the investigation and \r\ninspection team that visited Iraq in July, has declared that the Iraqi nuclear \r\nprogramme has been brought to nought. The team responsible for destroying \r\nchemical weapons in Baghdad is currently doing the same with regard to \r\nchemical weapons. \r\nFinally, I should like to point out that it is shameful for Kuwait and \r\nits allies to make such allegations for the sole purpose of perpetuating the \r\ninhuman siege against Iraq and the starving of its people. \r\nMiss AL-MULLA (Kuwait): Like the regime he represents, the Iraqi \r\nrepresentative\u0027s remarks are devoid of truth and sincerity. Deeds rather than \r\nwords attest to a country\u0027s record. Let it not be misunderstood; there is no \r\nlack of public pronouncements by Iraq attesting to a continued belligerent \r\nstance towards Kuwait and the international community. \r\nI shall take the points that the representative of Iraq made in response \r\nto the speech of my Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister this afternoon. \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n136 \r\n(Miss Al-Mulla. Kuwait;) \r\nOn the question of prisoners of war and detainees, I should like to make \r\nthe following points. Iraq to date refuses to accept the standard of \r\nprocedure of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit \r\nprisoners of war and detainees. Visits by the ICRC to places of detention in \r\nIraq are restricted. Norms for these visits are based on Iraqi laws and \r\nregulations, which the ICRC deems to be below the international standard set \r\nby the Committee. \r\nAs to the lists mentioned by the representative of Iraq, it is normal \r\nthat Kuwait should review the list periodically. It is abnormal for a list to \r\nbe submitted containing the same number as was submitted earlier. A review of \r\nthe list is necessitated due to the return of prisoners of war who come \r\nthrough other parties or through the ICRC. That is why Kuwait is keen to \r\nupdate these lists periodically. Kuwait has submitted two contradictory lists \r\nat the same time. \r\nAs to the second point, concerning the demarcation of the border, Iraq \r\nchose not to participate in the work of the demarcation Commission during its \r\nsession in July. Iraq is on record as saying that it would abide by Security \r\nCouncil resolution 687 (1991), which set up the Commission. However, Iraq has \r\nchosen not only not to participate in the work of the Commission, but to \r\nrepeat its claims over all of Kuwait. Taha Yassin Ramadhan, the \r\nVice-President of Iraq, said publicly in Jakarta, during the last Non-Aligned \r\nMovement meeting, that he reiterated Iraq\u0027s claims on Kuwait. \r\nIt is true that Kuwait\u0027s property is being returned, but the process is \r\nvery slow and .tedious. Iraq chooses the list that it submits to the \r\nco-ordinator for the return of property for submission. To date, Iraq refuses \r\nA/47/PV.11 \r\n137 \r\n(Miss Al-Mulla. Kuwait) \r\nto take responsibility for returning any of the private property that was \r\nlooted under the command and the order of officials of the Iraqi occupation \r\nforce in Kuwait. \r\nOn the question of resolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991), perhaps I am \r\nstating no secret when I say that it is Iraq\u0027s lack of compliance with those \r\nresolutions that is prompting the international community, and the Security \r\nCouncil in particular, to explore other avenues to facilitate some kind of \r\nassistance to the Iraqi population itself. Other aspects are being looked \r\ninto due to Iraq\u0027s refusal to abide by resolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991). \r\nIraq\u0027s record of compliance is attested to today by the decision of the \r\nSecurity Council to the effect that there is no reason for the Council to \r\nreview the sanctions upon Iraq during the 16-day period. I think that speaks \r\nsufficiently on Iraq\u0027s record of compliance. \r\nAGENDA ITEM 17 \r\nAPPOINTMENTS TO FILL VACANCIES IN SUBSIDIARY ORGANS AND OTHER APPOINTMENTS \r\n(a) APPOINTMENT OF MEMBERS OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON ADMINISTRATIVE AND \r\nBUDGETARY QUESTIONS: REPORT OF THE FIFTH COMMITTEE (PART I) (A/47/464) \r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): The Fifth Committee \r\nrecommends in paragraph 4 of its report (A/47/464) that the General Assembly \r\nappoint Mr. Ranjit Rae as a member of the Advisory Committee on Administrative \r\nand Budgetary Questions for a term of office beginning on 24 September 1992 \r\nand ending on 31 December 1992. \r\nMay I take it that the Assembly appoints Mr. Ranjit Rae? \r\nIt was so decided. \r\nThe meeting rose at 8.15 p.m. \r\n"
