ANATOLIJS GORBUNOVS, CHAIRMAN OF THE SUPREME COUNCIL OF THE \r\nREPUBLIC OF LATVIA \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nChairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia. \r\nMr. Anatolijs Gorbunovs. Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic \r\nof Latvia, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations the Chairman of the Supreme Council of the \r\nRepublic of Latvia, His Excellency Mr. Anatolijs Gorbunovs, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\nChairman GORBUNOVS (spoke in Latvian; English text furnished by the \r\ndelegation): Please accept Latvia\u0027s congratulations on your election to the \r\npresidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly, Sir. The \r\npeople of Latvia wish you a successful term as its leader. \r\nLatvia wishes to pay its respects to those nation States which have \r\nrecently been admitted to the United Nations and looks forward to coooperation \r\nwith them. \r\nMore than a year has passed since the Republic of Latvia, with the \r\nsupport of the world\u0027s democracies, restored its independence. This past year \r\nhas been characterized by the renewal of our State institutions. The \r\nrestoration of independence is a complicated process during which we have \r\nlearned from our mistakes. Our own experience and that of other nations has \r\ncontributed to making the transition process more effective. \r\nThe goal of independent Latvia to become a democratic free market \r\nState has not changed. Unchanged also are Latvia\u0027s efforts simultaneouly to \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n3 \r\n(Chairman Gorbunovs) \r\nfind an optimal solution to two acute and unavoidable problems: the \r\ncorrection of the injustices fostered by the illegal occupation and the \r\nprotection of the rights of all residents of Latvia. \r\nThe majority of States never recognized the annexation of Latvia. This \r\nwas of vital significance for the restoration of our independence. It is only \r\nnow that we have begun fully to understand the complexity of our situation. \r\nThe stabilization and development of our independence is largely dependent on \r\nthe objectivity with which the consequences of the former colonial policies \r\nare evaluated and on the manner in which they are eliminated. \r\nI would even say that in the recent past the restoration of independence \r\nin the Baltic States was of the utmost importance for security and stability \r\nin Europe. Today the international appraisal of the consequences of the \r\nannexation is just as crucial. A flawed approach to this question, which \r\nwould legitimize these consequences, could severely destabilize the political \r\nsituation in Latvia. \r\nBut now I invite representatives to take a fundamental and unprejudiced \r\nlook at the consequences of the half-century-long illegal incorporation of \r\nLatvia into the Soviet empire. \r\nForeign military troops are still stationed on the territory of Latvia. \r\nMoreover, the Latvian Government has been denied the right to monitor these \r\nforces. The lack of control over this army, its sometimes chaotic \r\ndemobilization, and its wilful and covert merging with economic enterprises \r\nand civil institutions in Latvia, create the threat of unsupervised arms \r\ntransfers, even to international markets. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n4 \r\n(Chairman Gorbunovs) \r\nToday there is no other nation State in the world with as many active or \r\nretired military persons per civilian as in Latvia. Our small nation has been \r\npressured to provide social guarantees, including living accommodation, to the \r\nmilitary forces of a great Power upon their withdrawal from Latvia. \r\nMeanwhile, Latvians who were deported to Siberia on a mass scale in 1941 and \r\n1949 are still unable to find housing in their homeland. Latvians who fled to \r\nthe West as a result of oppression by the former occupation regime, and who \r\nnow wish to return to their native land, are also unable to find accommodation. \r\nThe great neighbouring Power also attempts to determine the political \r\nbasis of our State the composition of its body of citizens. \r\nWe welcome the adherence of the Russian Federation to the Helsinki \r\nDocument of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, particularly \r\nparagraph 15, in which the participating States committed themselves to end the \r\n\"stationing of foreign armed forces on the territories of the Baltic \r\nStates without the required consent of those countries.\" (A/47/361. \r\nannex, para. 15) \r\nIn our turn, we can affirm the willingness of Latvia to see that the \r\ncommitment expressed in this paragraph is fulfilled in our negotiations with \r\nthe Russian Federation. Unfortunately, to date we have not seen similar \r\ninterest on the part of Russia. \r\nIt is a matter of concern that the view has been expressed in the \r\nParliament of the Russian Federation that the agreement already concluded on \r\nthe withdrawal of troops from Lithuania should be annulled. In the \r\nnegotiations with Latvia, the Russian delegation is constantly changing its \r\nposition even on matters previously agreed upon. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n5 \r\n(Chairman Gorbunovs) \r\nTherefore Latvia, together with Estonia and Lithuania, requested that the \r\nissue of the complete withdrawal of foreign military forces be included on the \r\nagenda of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Latvia also \r\ninvites the Security Council to send observers to the negotiations with the \r\nRussian Federation, and is looking forward to the other party\u0027s consent. \r\nAside from the serious issue of foreign military forces in Latvia, one of \r\nthe most serious consequences of the annexation of Latvia is the dangerous \r\nalteration of the demographic situation as a result of forced migration and \r\nthe Soviet Union\u0027s colonial policies. \r\nIn the last 50 years no other State has had its indigenous population \r\nreduced to the status of a near minority as a result of both immigration and \r\nthe loss of a large part of its indigenous population during occupations by \r\ntwo criminal regimes. Communist and Nazi. Latvia must now devote great \r\nefforts to preserving its State language, the major component of Latvian \r\nculture and heritage. \r\nAnother truth is becoming more transparent. We cannot utilize only \r\nexisting schemes and models to solve our internal problems. Our unique \r\ndemographic situation requires us to solve the citizenship question with \r\nrespect to immigrants on the one hand, to create a sr ~ure environment to \r\npreserve our national identity, and on the other to give immigrants every \r\nopportunity to integrate into Latvia\u0027s society while preserving and developing \r\ntheir own languages and cultural traditions. \r\nThe State of Latvia, of course, is interested in expanding its body of \r\ncitizens, but not with retired officers of the former Soviet army who, even \r\nnow, do not recognize the independence of Latvia. There are other States from \r\nA/47/PV. 12 \r\n5(a-z) \r\n(Chairman Gorbunovs) \r\nwhich the armed forces of the former Soviet Union are being withdrawn but the \r\npossibility of granting the citizenship of these States to former Soviet \r\nofficers has not been an issue. \r\nThe current domestic debate suggests that the Latvian Parliament adopt a \r\nlaw on citizenship in which the principal criteria for granting citizenship \r\nwould be a 10-year residency and a basic knowledge of Latvian. Such a law, if \r\naccepted by a referendum of citizens, would have legal force. Currently, all \r\npermanent residents of Latvia are being registered and are being given the \r\nopportunity freely to declare their intention to become citizens of Latvia or \r\nto remain citizens of another State which is their country of birth. \r\nFurthermore, the laws of Latvia guarantee, according to international \r\nstandards, each individual\u0027s human rights, which quite frequently, consciously \r\nor unconsciously, are confused with the right to citizenship. \r\nSome political forces in Latvia have requested that decolonization \r\npolicies be carried out. The notion of a colonized country in \r\ntwentieth-century Europe may seem strange. However, an examination of \r\nevidence provided by 50 years of annexation suggests the possible validity of \r\nthis notion. \r\nWhen referring to decolonization, in no case do we imply that all \r\nimmigrants must or will leave Latvia. However, our internal situation \r\nrequires clarity on the very important question of who must leave Latvia. \r\nFirst, the former Soviet military forces must leave. Secondly, all those \r\nforeign citizens to whom the existence of an independent Latvia is \r\nunacceptable must leave. Thirdly, those who wish to live among members of a \r\nsingle ethnic group, in Russia or elsewhere, will leave on their own \r\ninitiative. However, the great majority of immigrants will stay in Latvia, \r\nand our desire is that they be integrated into our society. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n6 \r\n(Chairman Gorbunovs) \r\nIn regard to the protection of human rights in Latvia, we wish to follow \r\nexamples found in independent and democratic States: the indigenous people, \r\nLatvians, should have the same rights as similar groups in other States, \r\nwhereas minority and immigrant groups should have cultural autonomy, including \r\nopportunities to use and develop their language. \r\nWe reject the accusations, made here by the Russian Federation, that the \r\nrights of minorities are being violated in Latvia. We are ready to have our \r\nhuman rights situation examined by experts of the Commission on Human Rights. \r\nWe are linking our hopes with the experiences of States that have \r\ntravelled the road of decolonization, and from these States we expect \r\nunderstanding and support. The economic reforms, which have brought good \r\nresults to many of these States, are very attractive and can be used by us. \r\nThe situation in the world, especially in Europe, is changing \r\nqualitatively. In the past, the world order was dictated by the great \r\nPowers or, to be more precise, by military-political blocs created by the \r\ngreat Powers. For better or for worse, this system worked, even if through \r\nmutual fear rather than mutual trust. \r\nThe stated goal of the former world order was the maintenance of world \r\npeace and stability. Contradictory or delayed actions are not the best means \r\nof increasing stability. The international recognition of Slovenia, Croatia \r\nand Bosnia and Herzegovina was delayed precisely because of such \r\nconsiderations; the tragic consequences of such a delay are still with us \r\ntoday. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n7 \r\n(Chairman Gorbunovs) \r\nIn international relations there exist problems of yet a different \r\nnature, problems related to the unification of nations as well as to the \r\nrepresentation in the world community of sovereign parts of a divided nation. \r\nThe Government of the Republic of China in Taiwan has been created by the \r\ntides of history. In our opinion, the international community has been unfair \r\nin ignoring this fact. Does not international experience bear evidence that \r\nparticipation in the international community by two sovereign parts of one \r\nnation provides an opportunity for a productive dialogue between these parts? \r\nThe United Nations must pay attention to the problems of both large and \r\nsmall States. In our opinion, the security of small States should be a \r\ncentral concern of the Organization, since there does not exist a balance of \r\npower or agreement on goals between small States and their larger neighbours \r\nat this time. \r\nIn my opinion, when discussing the relationships between nations, one \r\nmust remember that there are neither great nor small nations. A nation is \r\nonly as great as its will. Large and small States, however, can be equally \r\nfree even if not equally powerful. \r\nWe place high hopes in the United Nations. \r\nLatvia values highly the documents of the United Nations Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development, in particular \"Agenda 21\". We therefore \r\nreiterate our proposal, first made at Rio de Janeiro, that a conference be \r\nconvened in Latvia on the subject of \"Disarmament for Environment\". We ask \r\nthe United Nations and all States for their support. \r\nLatvia is grateful for the support received from the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP). A UNDP representative now resides in Riga and \r\nassists the Latvian Government in the preparation of projects on technical \r\nassistance. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n8 \r\n(Chairman Gorbunovs) \r\nA matter of great imporance to Latvia, from the viewpoint both of respect \r\nfor our sovereignty and of our capacity to pay, is the determination of the \r\nassessment rate for the contribution of Latvia to the regular budget, a rate \r\nthat will in turn determine our total contribution to the United Nations \r\nsystem. Respect for our sovereignty requires that the assessment be \r\ndetermined on the basis of data accepted by Latvia itself, rather than on data \r\nprovided by the State Statistical Committee of the former Soviet Union in \r\nparticular, because it is not and never has been the position of Latvia that \r\nit is a successor to the rights and obligations of the former Soviet Union. \r\nLatvia unequivocally supports the statement adopted at the first summit \r\nmeeting of the Security Council that the Secretary-General be invited to study \r\nmethods of strengthening and making more effective the capacity of the United \r\nNations for preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping. We support \r\nefforts that will decrease threats to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security and to our own sovereignty. Regrettably, in the presence of the \r\ninternal instability of large neighbouring States, the security of small \r\nStates is not guaranteed. Latvia would support the granting of authority to \r\nthe Secretary-General to use not only diplomacy against aggression but force \r\nas well. Of course, it will be necessary to create and approve a legal basis \r\nas well as a mechanism for the implementation of such authority. \r\nWe shall always be responsible to our nation for observing United Nations \r\nlegal norms and principles. Were we to fail in meeting our responsibilities, \r\nwe would not excuse ourselves by reference to our limited political \r\nexperience, nor to our economic problems. It is our hope that no State will \r\nuse its size or its economic and military power as an excuse for ignoring \r\nUnited Nations standards. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n9-10 \r\n(Chairman Gorbunovs) \r\nLatvia values highly the report \"An Agenda for Peace\", the inspiration \r\nfor, and author of, which was the Secretary-General. Latvia hopes that United \r\nNations support for the rightful demand to withdraw foreign military forces \r\nwill be evidence of the good will of world opinion and a good example of \r\npreventive diplomacy. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\nMr. Anatolijs Gorbunovs. Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic \r\nof Latvia, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n11 \r\nADDRESS BY MR. SIXTO DURAN BALLEN, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Ecuador. \r\nMr. Sixto Duran Ballen. President of the Republic of Ecuador, was \r\nescorted into the Assembly Hall. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic of Ecuador, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sixto Duran Ballen, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\nPresident DURAN BALLEN (interpretation from Spanish): I wish to \r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your well-deserved election to guide our \r\nendeavours during this session of the General Assembly. \r\nSimilarly, I extend to the Secretary-General my congratulations on his \r\nhaving assumed his important office at a time when the international community \r\nis going through substantial changes, and when it needs, in that high post, an \r\nexperienced and brilliant diplomat such as he. He has succeeded \r\nSecretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, an illustrious Latin American who \r\ndischarged the duties of the office with great effectiveness, as the new era \r\nrequired. \r\nMy presence here, so soon after assuming the Presidency of my country, \r\nmust be taken as a clear sign of the enormous importance we attach to the \r\nUnited Nations, its principles and its work, which is increasingly \r\nfar-reaching and truly valuable, work that is essentially that of keeping the \r\npeace and, also, of course, bringing about the economic and social development \r\nof all the peoples on Earth. The latter task is particularly important for \r\nEcuador, which is striving to overcome underdevelopment and achieve decent \r\nliving conditions for its people, particularly the great majorities. To that \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n12 \r\n(President Duran Ballen) \r\nend, we have begun to restructure the State, and we have already prescribed \r\nsome economic measures that will require sacrifice on the part of my \r\ncompatriots, but that will soon have positive effects. \r\nThe current international situation, stemming from the end of the cold \r\nwar, could be said to oscillate between disappointment and hope. There seems \r\nto exist something more than a truce between ideological rivalries, which we \r\nhope will lead us to a truer understanding among nations; and with the \r\nlessening influence of the private interests of individuals and nations, we \r\nhope it will give way to an international equilibrium which will allow us to \r\nforge ahead, together, towards universal, stable and lasting peace. \r\nThat circumstance explains the special importance of the fact that, in \r\ninternational life, respect for the human being has assumed top priority and \r\nman finds himself exalted, raised to heights never enjoyed until a few decades \r\nago. But the continued enjoyment of such a position, despite the \r\ndiscontinuities still existing in certain corners of the world, requires the \r\nconstant political commitment of States, which, fortunately, is widespread, to \r\nthe unconditional implementation of the constitutional and conventional norms \r\nthat reinforce that conquest at its various levels. \r\nSpeaking of human rights, my Government is firmly and irrevocably \r\nresolved to apply, both domestically and internationally, a policy of full \r\nrespect for, and defence of, those very rights, in consonance with the dignity \r\nof man, as a tribute to his spirituality and in clear recognition of his \r\ntranscendental values. Respect for human rights is not a gracious concession \r\nthat Governments make to their peoples, but rather an unwritten, intrinsic \r\nobligation of democracy and civil life. The opposite is barbarism, the denial \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n13 \r\n(President Duran Ballen) \r\nof some men by others; it is the action of the few who, using the power given \r\nto them by the community for the common good, distort it and turn it into the \r\nsupreme evil of pitting man against man. My Government will use any and all \r\nmeans in the prevention against such ignominy. \r\nMoreover, one can see that the world community has emphasized, out of a \r\nconcept of solidarity, not only the promotion of human rights but also the \r\nrendering of humanitarian assistance to those most in need of it, and has \r\nfound itself searching for ever more effective mechanisms to extend such \r\nassistance to all corners of the Earth, wherever violence or natural disasters \r\ncontinue to breed hunger and despair. \r\nDespite the fact that we find ourselves in an ever more interdependent \r\nworld where it is essential that cooperation not be linked to specific \r\npolitical interests, a world where integration is and must be the language \r\nwhich best expresses the hopes of peoples, we still face positions that \r\nprevent economic relations from being eguitable to and supportive of \r\ndeveloping countries within the effective exercise of the principle of \r\ninternational free trade, towards which my Government is working and will work \r\naccording to a plan. \r\nThe success of this new course will depend greatly not only on immense \r\ndomestic efforts but also on the necessary alignment of the theory of \r\ninternational solidarity with the real, sincere and favourable response of the \r\ninternational community, and on the understanding of the industrialized \r\ncountries concerning the need to settle, on mutually agreeable terms, the \r\nproblem of the external debt of the least developed countries, whose burden is \r\nanother of the serious difficulties preventing those countries from developing \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n14-15 \r\n(President Duran Ballen) \r\nand attaining better living standards. It would be most promising were an \r\nagreement reached on the mechanisms for alleviating this problem, which is at \r\nthe same time economic and financial, and a problem whose repercussions in the \r\nsocial and political fields no one now denies. Among such mechanisms, those \r\naimed at converting external debt into investment, especially in development \r\nprojects, both social and economic, should be pressed forward. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n16 \r\n(President Duran Ballen) \r\nFortunately the dark atomic threat is disappearing. The agreements and \r\nundertakings which, with a new vision of the very destiny of mankind, have the \r\naim of eliminating nuclear arms, are a source of hope. At the same time, they \r\ncan be the means by which, by eliminating the enormous waste of resources, we \r\nmay help to solve economic and social problems and embark upon a process of \r\nfrank cooperation with nations that are in the greatest need of help to raise \r\ntheir standards of living. \r\nNotwithstanding these positive advances and these undertakings, we look \r\nto the future with concern, as the new situation resulting from the historic \r\ncircumstances of the last two years has not managed to prevent the outburst of \r\nbloody regional conflicts. Nationalist extremists have produced the \r\nphenomenon of the exceptionally violent disintegration of States, and in such \r\na climate new calamities and hardships have arisen. \r\nA responsible approach to the common obligations of mankind is now more \r\nimportant than ever before. The world has shrunk physically and in terms of \r\nhuman relationships. The problems of a particular State affect other States \r\nin various ways and make it necessary that we take remedial action in a spirit \r\nof solidarity. \r\nMeanwhile, the old problems of disparity between an economically powerful \r\nworld, embracing a limited number of countries, and the developing world, \r\ncomprising the bulk of mankind, continue to worsen. Insufficient funding for \r\ndevelopment has become endemic, making necessary decisions on a global basis. \r\nMoreover, the insufficiency of funding means that all States must carry a fair \r\nshare of the load. Without help, poor States cannot free themselves from \r\ntheir condition of impoverishment, and they cannot partake in the enjoyment of \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n17 \r\n(President Duran Ballen) \r\na life of dignity, free from the fear of insecurity and poverty. For this \r\nreason, we firmly support the convening of an international conference on the \r\nfinancing of development, in order to allelviate in some way the situation of \r\nthe great number of States that urgently need extensive economic assistance. \r\nFelipe Herrera, the Chilean to whom Latin Amderica owes so much, used to \r\nspeak of the \"mystique of urgency\" that we must regain. Today I pay tribute \r\nto his memory. The social problems are urgent, and we must press the \r\ninternational organizations to provide funds accordingly and, in this regard, \r\nto demonstrate flexibility in keeping with each country\u0027s stage of development. \r\nWe are convinced that international trade, conducted in a transparent, \r\nnon-discriminatory manner and on equitable terms, will be an important force \r\nin the revitalization of the world economy and will therefore be important to \r\nthe developing countries. It is paradoxical and serious that the countries \r\nthat are the greatest advocates of the elimination of trade barriers maintain, \r\nand even create new types of, protectionism and discrimination that make it \r\ndifficult for the products of developing countries to gain access to their \r\nmarkets. This applies at present, for example, to bananas. And all this is \r\ntaking place in the interdependent world that I mentioned at the beginning of \r\nmy statement. \r\nIn 1962 or 1963, as the representative of the Inter-American Development \r\nBank, I spoke here about social questions. I believe that once again the \r\nUnited Nations must give these questions urgent attention. Economic \r\ndevelopment is important only insofar as it meets human needs. It is time all \r\ngreat social problems were better understood so that the United Nations might \r\ndraw up an international programme of action to serve as the basis for the \r\nconference on social questions that it has been decided to convene. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n18 \r\n(President Duran Ballen) \r\nPreservation of the environment, which is linked inextricably to \r\nsustainable development, is of enormous importance because of its national and \r\ninternational impact. The Stockholm Declaration of 1972 represented the first \r\ninternational step towards the establishment of basic universal principles for \r\nthe protection of the world\u0027s environment. Since 1972 significant efforts \r\nhave been made to stop pollution of land, seas and air and to prevent \r\ndesertification and deforestation and other types of ecological damage. \r\nHowever, the constraints of reality made new initiatives necessary, and \r\nthese culminated in the Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de \r\nJaneiro in June 1992 a landmark event whose basic aim was to achieve \r\nagreement on certain programmes aimed at arresting the steady deterioration of \r\nthe environment. Let us hope that the outcome of that Conference will be \r\ngenerally beneficial and will help to guarantee the future development and \r\nwell-being of mankind. My Government is ready to take action to improve the \r\nenvironment of its own country and to contribute to universal efforts to \r\npreserve nature. \r\nBut I must emphasize that although the developed countries, which are \r\nmainly responsible for the deterioration of the environment, have a particular \r\nobligation, it is other countries that are being asked to make the sacrifice \r\nof restricting the exercise of their legitimate right to use the wealth that \r\nnature has given them. It is necessary to seek due compensation jointly, \r\nespecially in the shape of financal aid and technological cooperation. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n19-20 \r\n(President Duran Ballen) \r\nEcuador, having become a transit country and an operational bridgehead \r\nfor the drug trade, understands that drug trafficking, money laundering and \r\nrelated crimes are particularly harmful to young people, threaten democracy, \r\nproduce an unnatural economy and, above all, damage the moral values of \r\nnations. We condemn drug trafficking in all its forms, and, while we do what \r\nwe can to combat it, responsibility must be shared by the producer countries \r\nand the consumer contries. Thus we support the timely initiative of the \r\nPresident of Colombia, who, from this rostrum, suggested that a United Nations \r\nconference on illicit drugs be planned and convened with all the urgency that \r\nthis matter demands. \r\nUnresolved economic and social, as well as humanitarian and ecological, \r\nproblems of overriding importance continue to be a source of instability, and \r\nthey carry the seeds of damage to international relations and even of conflict. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n21 \r\n(President Duran Ballen) \r\nFor those reasons, the Council requested the Secretary-General to prepare a \r\nspecial report, appropriately titled \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277). \r\nAs a fresh contribution to previous efforts within the United Nations, \r\nwhether to strengthen international security, promote good-neighbourly \r\nrelations between States or to further the use of procedures to ensure he \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, and with the constant aim of maintaining \r\npeace, this new Agenda introduced by the Secretary-General has some creative \r\naspects and offers innovate alternatives for States to consider notably, the \r\none he has so aptly termed \"preventive diplomacy\". As the well-known popular \r\nsaying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. My country, \r\nwhich is profoundly peace-loving by vocation and abides by the international \r\nprinciples of peaceful coexistence, supports this felicitous initiative by the \r\nSecretary-General, which will surely alert the nations to new opportunities \r\nfor understanding and valid options for settling their disputes. \r\nPeace is not a blessing bestowed on us through the simple desire to live \r\ntogether peaceably: the need to cooperate in good faith while respecting the \r\nfundamental principles of the United Nations Charter is also important. Peace \r\nis the result of a universal awareness that it is only by making a genuine \r\ncontribution to the common weal, to the law of States, and with growing \r\nactivities in solidarity and with international justice and equity that peace \r\ncan grow and establish itself. Only in this way will peace be an integral \r\npart of the harmonious development of our peoples and of their security. \r\nA few weeks after my Government\u0027s inauguration, I came to this forum, the \r\nGeneral Assembly, to make known not only my country\u0027s general ideas about the \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n22 \r\n(President Duran Ballen) \r\nworld situation but also the principles which it has traditionally applied and \r\nwill continue to apply in its international policy and, at the same time, to \r\nreiterate Ecuador\u0027s determination to contribute, as resolutely and \r\nwholeheartedly as possible, to the establishment of a permanent and \r\nconstructive peace among all people. \r\nThe people of Ecuador loves peace and believes in justice. My Government \r\nearnestly desires to maintain friendly relations with all countries and most \r\nof all with its neighbours; this is, of course, the natural result of \r\nEcuador\u0027s deep-seated feelings, which, historically speaking, been expressed \r\nsince the birth of the Republic, and are part of its character. \r\nEcuador, as representatives in this General Assembly will already be well \r\naware, is sincerely determined to solve its territorial problem with Peru. \r\nThe beginning of dialogue between the two countries\u0027 Heads of State was a \r\nmajor step forward in this quest: it overcame the political taboo that had \r\nprevented Ecuadorians and Peruvians from discussing this situation in cordial, \r\nfrank and constructive terms, without ignoring legitimate national interests \r\nand studying the obvious opportunities for joint development. \r\nIt is my pleasure to inform this world forum that I am determined that \r\nthe handling of the territorial problem with Peru - which, for so many years \r\npast has been a source of mistrust, concern and even discord between our two \r\ncountries will be directed towards transforming the mutual suspicions of the \r\npast on the basis of justice and realism, in cooperation and with our efforts \r\ndedicated to the development of our impoverished peoples. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n23 \r\n(President Duran Ballen! \r\nOur two countries, so alike on many counts, can and, above all, must find \r\na just, honourable and realistic solution to the territorial dispute, which \r\nwill mean a real process of economic intergration. That is why, on the very \r\nday my Government took office, I said, in the presence of \r\nPresident Alberto Fujimori, that Ecuador would steadfastly continue to speak \r\nclearly and frankly, in an atmosphere of harmony and mutual respect with the \r\nhelp of the four countries which have historically been most closely \r\nassociated with Ecuador and Peru on this matter over the last 50 years, and \r\nwith the eminent participation of His Holiness John Paul II, in order to reach \r\na permanent solution to this territorial dispute as soon as possible. This \r\nwill enable Ecuador and Peru to extend a hand of friendship from the Pacific \r\nto the Amazon, which was discoverd by an expedition that set out from Quito. \r\nIn fact, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States of America have \r\nbeen cognizant of the territorial crisis besetting Ecuador and Peru and have \r\nbeen witnesses in good standing of the hard times of sacrifice and suffering \r\nfor my country; they know the history of the formation of our Republics, the \r\nmisfortunes of their independence and of the subsequent years. They know \r\nabout the origins and the epics of our peoples, about our rights and the \r\nevents that have gone to weave the pattern of our history. For all those \r\nreasons, in a most special way, these four sister countries are destined to \r\ncontribute to the search for just and creative initiatives to encourage \r\nEcuador and Peru to overcome this territorial problem once and for all in \r\nshort, to enable\u0027 them, with vision and courage, to write their common history. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n24 \r\n(President Duran Ballen) \r\nWhat can I say about the invaluable aid and assistance that His Holiness \r\nthe Pope has given many countries, guided always by his vocation for peace and \r\nunderstanding between governments and peoples, particularly those of deep \r\nChristian faith? With his enlightened thought, as set out in the encyclical \r\n\"Centesimus Annus\", he has exhorted us to take specific steps to establish or \r\nconsolidate international structures designed to seek peaceful solutions, and \r\nhas reminded us that arbitration is an appropriate method of resolving \r\nconflicts which would otherwise keep nations unnecessarily estranged. \r\nThat is why my predecessor, President Rodrigo Borja, quite rightly \r\nsuggested, from this very rostrum, that His Holiness the Pope should offer his \r\nmost valuable assistance, which would without a doubt be of great \r\nsignificance. In different terms and in another context, the President of \r\nPeru, during his official visit to Ecuador in January 1992, also stressed the \r\nsingular importance of His Holiness\u0027s cooperation. \r\nIn my inaugural message to my Government on 10 August last, I \r\nacknowledged that our views on these matters might differ from those of the \r\nGovernment and President of Peru; but that is precisely why it is important \r\nfor there to be a frank and sincere dialogue between our Governments and \r\npeoples which dialogue would be the more significant for the fraternal aid \r\nof the four countries and the succour and assistance of the successor of Saint \r\nPeter. \r\nIn conclusion, my Government and country are more convinced than ever of \r\nthe immense contribution being made by the United Nations in the various \r\nfields of vital importance for humankind. I am personally honoured to recall \r\nthat my father was the first Ambassador of the Republic of Ecuador to this \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n25 \r\n(President Duran Ballen) \r\nOrganization when it was taking its first steps in San Francisco. The \r\nGovernment of my country trusts that the noble objectives of peace and mutual \r\nunderstanding between all nations near and far, which have come notably to the \r\nfore in recent times, will eventually bring us good results which will make it \r\npossible for the world to enter the twenty-first century renewed and with its \r\ninternational relations restructured under the seal of law, justice and \r\nsustainable development for all peoples. \r\nI am quite sure that this General Assembly, by resolutely serving these \r\ninterests, will bring us noticeably closer to the goal we all wish so much to \r\nreach. Let us embark upon this new path. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n26 \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe President of the Republic of Ecuador for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Sixto Duran Ballen. President of the Republic of Ecuador, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\nADDRESS BY MR. EDUARD A. SHEVARDNADZE, CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF STATE OF THE \r\nREPUBLIC OF GEORGIA \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nChairman of the Council of State of the Republic of Georgia. \r\nMr. Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Chairman of the Council of State of the \r\nRepublic of Georgia, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations the Chairman of the Council of State of the \r\nRepublic of Georgia, His Excellency Mr. Eduard A. Shevardnadze, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\nChairman SHEVARDNADZE (interpretation from Russian): One does not \r\nusually say anything personal from this podium. I would submit, however, that \r\nmy position does allow me to depart from this role. Exactly two years ago, I \r\nfinished my address here and left this very podium for what I thought was the \r\nlast time. Yes, I foresaw my resignation from the post of Foreign Minister of \r\nthe Soviet Union, as I also foresaw menacing changes coming. \r\nBefore coming here again I reread that address. The ideas that inspired \r\nit are, I think, still valid today. They helped me make a forecast that has \r\nbeen borne out by current events. I said then that all the peoples of the \r\nSoviet Union were entering the political arena and reassuming their age-old \r\nnational names. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n27 \r\n(Chairman Shevardnadze) \r\nAll of them, including my country, are being dogged by the merciless \r\nonslaught of the economic crisis, which I also spoke about in my appeal to the \r\ninternational community to set up an international mechanism capable of \r\nmitigating its adverse effects. \r\nI said then that after the end of the cold war new and sinister figures \r\nwould appear on the world political scene, and that the breakdown of attempts \r\nto take the road to democracy would give rise to chaos and new dictatorial \r\nregimes. I followed my prediction about the threat of new armed conflicts \r\nemerging, of mass hostage-taking and the spread of terrorism with the \r\nconclusion that regional structures security structures - operating under \r\nUnited Nations auspices must be set up. \r\nEven that long ago, two years, I keenly felt the need to really think in \r\nterms of doctrine about the new realities of the contemporary world, to \r\nre-examine the old principles of our interrelationships, in both the inter-\r\nand intra-State areas, and to work out new ones. \r\nWhen I spoke then I was speaking as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of a \r\ngreat Power. Now I am speaking as the representative of a country that is \r\nmicroscopic in comparison. However, the dramatic change in scale does not \r\nreduce the size of the problems. In that tiny part of Earth called Georgia, \r\nwhich history has nailed to the geopolitical cross, have converged, in a \r\nmanner that passes understanding, all the woes and contradictions that the \r\nEmpire fed into its genetic code and constantly generated, and which continue \r\nto rack us even now that the Empire is dead. Everything I thought and spoke \r\nof, foresaw and predicted has befallen Georgia, my country. And there was no \r\nneed for clairvoyance, either; all you needed was to know the system you were \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n28-30 \r\n(Chairman Shevardnadze) \r\ndealing with. One of the greats once said that predicting important events in \r\nthe future was no more difficult than successfully guessing the past: if past \r\nevents leave traces, then, logically, future events must have roots. \r\nThe system was doomed. In August 1991, there was an attempt to save it \r\nusing its own typical methods: conspiracy, flouted laws, the use of force. I \r\nhad on many occasions warned about the possibility of a coup and totalitarian \r\nrevanchism. If the necessary conclusions had been drawn from these words of \r\nwarning, then we would have been dealing not with the chaotic collapse of a \r\nhuge Power, but with relatively painless and controllable transitions to a new \r\nstatus quo and to the formation of new States. The swiftness of the death \r\nthroes and the speed of the disintegration took the world community by \r\nsurprise. It was caught off guard, and is now seeing how new offshoots of \r\nviolence, new offshoots of catastrophe, are sprouting from the exposed \r\nrootstock. \r\nGeorgia will serve as a typical example. Here we have deep \r\nsocio-economic crisis. Here the fall of the Empire was attended by the rise \r\nof a dictatorial regime. Here several internal conflicts were provoked, and \r\nseparatism threatens to break up a small country and splinter its historic \r\nterritory into dwarf States. Here subversion, terrorism and mass \r\nhostage-taking rule. And, finally, here as nowhere else is the danger so \r\ngreat that the existing internal conflicts will merge with the ones in \r\nneighbouring States and grow into regional or even continental wars fought \r\nalong national or religious lines. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n31 \r\n(Chairman Shevardnadze) \r\nI would recall that, like some other countries, Georgia was incorporated \r\ninto the Soviet Union by military force. That force was inspired by an \r\nideology that placed the interests of the class struggle far above common \r\nhuman goals and national values. In the light of this ideology, the integrity \r\nof territories and borders that had been shaped over time was of no \r\nsignificance: they were redrawn and parcelled out again to follow the lines \r\non the battlefield of proletarian internationalism. The State, political, \r\nadministrative and territorial structure so formed was such that it contained \r\nwithin itself the germs of dissatisfaction, smouldering enmity and potential \r\nconflict within republics and between them. \r\nTime bombs were planted for our futures. While the power of ideology and \r\nrepressive compulsion kept this heterogeneous community together, the bombs \r\nlay idle. As soon as that power was removed, they went off, and today a blast \r\nfront of enormous power is destroying whole States. \r\nGeorgia too is threatened. The history of Georgia\u0027s struggle for \r\nstatehood spans many centuries. For many centuries, this struggle went \r\ntogether with the formation of a distinctive national culture and the defence \r\nof its faith and language. In the year 337 AD, Christianity, as the State \r\nreligion, blessed the country\u0027s impulse towards unity within its own common \r\nborders. Having become a powerful State in Western Asia by the eleventh and \r\ntwelfth centuries, Georgia established cultural centres both within its own \r\nborders and in various other States beyond. \r\nMy portrait of Georgia would not be complete if I missed out one very \r\nimportant feature: from time immemorial, as part of the flow of peoples, \r\nideas and cultures, Georgia has upheld racial and religious tolerance as a \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n32 \r\n(Chairman Shevardnadze) \r\nbasic tenet of its way of life. Forced to do battle with the most powerful \r\nforeign adversaries, Georgia did not suffer from either xenophobia or \r\nreligious fanaticism. In its capital city, Tbilisi, within an area of one \r\nsquare kilometre, one can see a Georgian Orthodox church, an Armenian \r\nGregorian cathedral, a mosque, a synagogue and a Lutheran church. Christian \r\nfrom the fourth century on, Georgia has also seen Islam take root in some of \r\nits historically important provinces. And never was there enmity or discord \r\nbetween them, nor was anyone denied the right to live according to his or her \r\nown beliefs or traditions. \r\nUnfortunately for all of us, the slings and arrows of history brought \r\ndown this unity, from within as well as from outside, and something similar is \r\nhappening now. I consider it my duty to draw your attention to the Caucasus \r\nregion, as, here and now, a new and serious hotbed of interethnic, regional \r\nand international tension is emerging. \r\nThis new source of Shockwaves is within the mainstream of contemporary \r\ngeopolitical trends: the displacement of a global confrontation onto regional \r\nlevels. This displacement has taken the form of large-scale armed conflicts, \r\nsuch as the ones we are seeing in some countries of Europe, around the \r\nDniestr, at home in Georgia and in Transcaucasia, and in Central Asia. \r\nThis vacuum of ideas abhors its own emptiness. We should have started \r\nthinking about events in the huge expanse from Bosnia to Tajikistan, including \r\nthe Caucasus, and studying them, long ago, to find out the whys and \r\nwherefores. Sound politicians and statesmen as well as ordinary people, \r\nwhether Christian or Muslim, who live in this vast area or elsewhere have a \r\nduty to halt this most dangerous process. The threat of large-scale conflicts \r\nkindled and enflamed by fundamentalism of whatever kind is too \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n33 \r\n(Chairman Shevardnadze) \r\nserious to be ignored. And the danger is that much greater when fanaticism is \r\nexploited by fundamentalists of a Bolshevist stripe. \r\nAlthough they have various causes, the new conflicts do have some \r\nfeatures in common, particularly the following: they all began and are \r\ndeveloping against a background in which a number of factors are operating \r\neither simultaneously or partially. These are an ethnic patchwork; a variety \r\nof religions and denominations; socio-economic inequality; and a troubled \r\nhistorical and political past. \r\nIn the case of the Caucasus, these factors which are common to all the \r\nregions in question must be added to the specificity of its geopolitical \r\nsituation. At the meeting point of powerful geopolitical forces, it has from \r\ntime immemorial served as a buffer zone between South and North, Christianity \r\nand Islam, as an arena in which they played out their aspirations and \r\ninterests. \r\nThe disintegration of the Soviet Union has left an opening for new \r\nrivalries to appear. Because of their political, economic and military \r\nweakness, the new States of the Caucasus are not able to fill this vacuum and \r\nestablish reliable safeguards for their own security. External forces apart, \r\nvarious internal groupings are trying to turn the vacuum to their own \r\nadvantage under the cover of nationalistic, pseudopatriotic, separatist, and, \r\nmost recently, even religious guises with their own, self-serving politcal \r\nagendas. \r\nThe activities of the so-called Confederation of the Mountain Peoples of \r\nthe Caucasus, which has flouted the sovereignty, the territorial integrity and \r\nthe borders of the Republic of Georgia, have made this clear in one way or \r\nanother. Against the will of the people of the northern Caucasus and their \r\nlegally elected governments, this illegal, in essence openly terrorist, \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n34 \r\n(Chairman Shevardnadze) \r\nmilitarized organization, serving no State, has called for any means to be \r\nused, including mass terror; has declared our country, and its capital city, a \r\ndisaster zone; and has been sending mercenaries and terrorist killers, in the \r\nguise of volunteers, across our frontiers. Under our very eyes, the flames of \r\nwar are rising, and are even now threatening to engulf not only Georgia alone. \r\nRight before our eyes a new war is blazing up, threatening not just \r\nGeorgia. There is only one conclusion to be drawn: in comparison with the \r\nother \"hot spots\" of the post-communist world, the risk of conflict in the \r\nCaucasus is higher, and the Caucasus therefore endangers international peace \r\nand security more. \r\nGeorgia is at the very centre of where the problems of the Caucasus \r\nmeet. Yet again, as so often before in our history, Georgia\u0027s fate, its \r\nstatehood and its very existence are marked on the map. Faced with the \r\ncomplex interactions of internal and external forces, we are striving to \r\nimplement an active, balanced policy. Within the country, our policy is one \r\nof democratic transformation, national reconciliation and peaceful settlement \r\nof conflicts, while externally it is one of the development of friendly \r\nrelationships with all the countries in the region and cooperation with the \r\nworld community. \r\nWe are grateful to our neighbours through history: to Turkey, with which \r\nwe have concluded a friendhip treaty; and to Iran, with which we are \r\ndeveloping friendly contacts, to the mutual benefit of both countries. Our \r\ncenturies-long links with the peoples of Transcaucasia, Armenia and \r\nAzerbaijan, and with the republics of the Northern Caucasus and with Ukraine, \r\ngive us an excellent foundation for close cooperetion in the interest of our \r\ncountries. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n35 \r\n(Chairman Shevardnadze) \r\nOf particular importance to us and not to us alone are our relations \r\nwith Russia. Russia has assisted us in setting up machinery to settle the \r\nGeorgian-Ossetian conflict. Twice now Russia has borne witness to the \r\nprinciple of the territorial integrity and inviolability of the borders of our \r\nState, and has joined in the process of achieving a peaceful settlement in \r\nanother conflict, in Abkhazia. \r\nA stable, prosperous and democratic Russia is a factor on a global scale \r\nand global in significance. A threat to Russia from the forces of \r\ntotalitarian revanchism is a threat to us all. In the conspiracy against \r\nGeorgia which is now coming out into the open, Russia\u0027s red-brown \r\nreactionaries are standing shoulder to shoulder with the extreme \r\nfundamentalists, home-grown fascists and separatists. The world must know \r\nabout this, and the world has a duty to help reinforce a stable, democratic \r\nRussia and, by so doing, help both us and its own self. \r\nThose are the facts of our political life today. Those facts are why we \r\nkeep trying to achieve the establishment of a Transcaucasian mechanism for \r\nconsultation and agreement. We propose that we should begin to establish a \r\nsystem of collective security in the Black Sea-Caucasus region, and, in this \r\nregard, we very much appreciate Turkey\u0027s initiatives. We support the new \r\ninstitutions of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), \r\nwhose goal is conflict prevention and the protection of the rights of national \r\nminorities. Our doors are wide open to fact-finding missions from European or \r\nworld organizations. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n36 \r\n(Chairman Shevardnadze) \r\nHowever, today this is not enough. The end of the cold war has put the \r\nneed to develop a more effective system of global security on the agenda. The \r\npace of events is outstripping us; the European process is falling behind, and \r\nhas been very late with its response to the challenges of a time of \r\ntransformations. There has been a significant lag too in the United Nations \r\nreaction to the major changes in various regions of the world, with the \r\nchanges in the former Soviet Union in the forefront. \r\nWe welcome the bold initiatives of the Secretary-General aimed at making \r\nthe Organization more dynamic and capable of responding quickly to the needs \r\nof the day. His report \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277) quite rightly raises \r\nthe question of the United Nations taking a multi-tiered approach to the \r\nproblems of the modern world. It is a good thing that an authoritative, \r\nindependent commission has been set up to examine the role of the Organization \r\nunder current conditions. \r\nThere is no need to fear reforms when reforms are so necessary, \r\nespecially, in our view, in the two interrelated fields of peace-keeping and \r\nnation-building in the newly independent States. I have a number of \r\nsuggestions to make about these two fields. \r\nMy first suggestion concerns the establishment of a global monitoring \r\nnetwork for the monitoring, prevention and settlement of internal conflicts. \r\nSpecial United Nations observers at \"hot spots\" and regional bureaux, missions \r\nand information centres would help us obtain a clear picture of events and \r\ndevelop specific responses. The machinery for doing this should be based \r\nright in the regions where conflict is occurring; in our example, in the \r\nCaucasus it could be based on the United Nations office in Tbilisi. We would \r\nalso suggest expanding the mandate of the CSCE High Commissioner for national \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n37 \r\n(Chairman Shevardnadze) \r\nminorities so that, if required, he could inform the Secretary-General and our \r\nOrganization\u0027s Commission on Human Rights. The most important thing is that \r\nthis should be got off the ground as quickly as possible. Similar \r\ninstitutions with the same mandates could be established within other regional \r\norganizations too. \r\nThe United Nations needs a special body to collect and process \r\ninformation on potential ethnic conflicts and to draw conclusions and issue \r\nrecommendations based upon it. Another of its functions would be to forecast \r\nconflict situations at an early stage in their gestation. \r\nThe International Court too could be brought in to consider conflicts. \r\nThe role and the capabilities of the Security Council must be looked at \r\nanew. We have more than once raised the issue of whether the Military Staff \r\nCommittee should not become more actively involved. Now that the cold war is \r\nover but the number of \"hot spots\" is burgeoning, the Security Council cannot \r\ndo without this, or another similar structure, if it is to carry out its \r\nfunction under the Charter in full measure. \r\nIt must be made binding on the States Members of the United Nations to \r\ninform the Security Council of imminent conflicts. Failure to comply must \r\ncall down sanctions. We commit ourselves to sending the United Nations and \r\nits Security Council annual reports on the state of affairs in the areas of \r\nthe protection of human rights and national minorities, and on crisis \r\nsituations which could lead to serious complications within the country or the \r\nregion. \r\nThis problem has yet another facet: information. Rivalry spills over \r\ninto the newspapers and on the airwaves, and the side with the best \r\ntechnology, the most money and the widest access to the media and to media \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n38 \r\n(Chairman Shevardnadze) \r\npeople wins. Public opinion becomes one-sided and unfounded, but this again \r\nis half the battle. The worst thing is that this guerilla warfare in the \r\nmedia nourishes the soil of conflicts and makes them more difficult to \r\nsettle. We see a possible way out of this by establishing centres to \r\ndisseminate objective information under the auspices of the international \r\norganizations. \r\nMy second suggestion concerns the problem of refugees. Ethnic conflicts \r\nhave increased their number manyfold: no one now knows exactly how many there \r\nare. No one knows what resources are needed to help them and what we should \r\nstart doing first to rule out the possibility of fresh conflicts after they \r\nreturn home. Here too a system of observers is needed, as is an aid \r\norganization larger in scale than what we have now and capable not only of \r\nproviding material support but of making the whole process more manageable. \r\nIn our view, the work of the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees \r\nneeds root-and-branch reform. \r\nMy third suggestion is that there should be general and comprehensive \r\ncontrol over the proliferation of arms. The clans of ethnic mafiosi spawned \r\nunder the totalitarian system are accumulating the colossal sums needed to \r\nacquire weapons and to suborn soldiers into taking part in hostilities and \r\npassing out materiel to the irregulars on the quiet. The national security \r\nforces and law-enforcement agencies in the young independent States are being \r\noverwhelmed by this epidemic of out-of-control arms races. What we need are \r\ninternational rapid deployment forces a sort of Interpol of Blue Helmets -\r\nan independent disarmament monitoring agency and the introduction of regional \r\narms registers. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n39 \r\n(Chairman Shevardnadze) \r\nMy fourth suggestion is for United Nations rapid deployment forces in the \r\nfield of international legal thought and theoretical and doctrinal \r\ndevelopments. The traditional system of legal guidelines is lagging \r\nhopelessly far behind the onrush of geopolitical changes. The world is facing \r\narbitrary and one-sided interpretations of a whole range of internationally \r\nrecognized principles. Arbitrary, wild-cat declarations of sovereignty have \r\nled in practice to encroachments on the territorial integrity of States and on \r\nthe inviolability of their borders, and to large population groups being \r\nturned into second-class citizens; it has also caused and will cause many \r\nbloody conflicts. \r\nUnfortunately, separatism and extremism, when combined, are the ruin not \r\njust of States but of legal systems too. The top dogs of the separatist \r\nmovements are bending the rules so far they are turning them into \r\ncaricatures. If extremist separatism is not stopped, what awaits is a world \r\nsplintered and in collapse, with the anarchy and chaos lasting into the \r\ntwenty-first century. \r\nOn no account can some principles be made absolute at the expense of \r\nothers. It is morally wrong for one group to go for self-determination as if \r\nthey do not notice that for centuries, side-by-side with them, on the same \r\nland, there have been peoples living, peoples that cannot physically be \r\nremoved. This is the problem to beat all problems of today\u0027s world. \r\nEvery aspiration, every claim, every norm and category should be measured \r\nin terms of the human scale of politics, whose priorities are the equality of \r\nthe rights of each citizen, of everybody, regardless of nationality, \r\nethnicity, language or religion. In the light of this approach, we see that \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n40 \r\n(Chairman Shevardnadze) \r\nnot only do national minorities need to have their rights protected, but so do \r\nthe citizens of the majority, however paradoxical that may sound. Otherwise, \r\nwe may face an updated form of apartheid and ethnic dictatorship, like we have \r\nin the conflict zone of Abkhazia, where the minority has managed to impose its \r\nwill on the majority. \r\nHow could this have come about? What we have here is a classic example \r\nof self-interested bending of the law. Thanks to a discriminatory electoral \r\nlaw, electors of a single nationality, comprising no more than 18 per cent of \r\nthe population, send more deputies to the parliament of the Abkhazian \r\nAutonomous Republic than the electors in another that makes up more than half \r\nthe population there, and the rights of the other national groups are being \r\ntrampled on too: it takes only a third as many votes to elect one Abkhazi \r\ndeputy as it does to elect a Georgian, a Russian, an Armenian and so on. \r\nAt the end of the day, this kind of legal extremism leads to bitter \r\nconfrontation. The governing elite, reflecting as it does the mood of the \r\nextremist wing of the minority, is ruling by Draconian diktat and is going so \r\nfar as to wrest territory that has been Georgia\u0027s from time immemorial away \r\nfrom it. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n41 \r\n(Chairman Shevardnadze) \r\nSeparatism is immune to dialogue and compromise: this we know from our \r\nown experience. Separatism does not want talks, rejects the methods of \r\nrational politics and even balks at implementing what it has agreed. It \r\nswitches meanings, calling agression and occupation \"movement of military \r\nsub-units within our own territory\". How can this be? And in Georgia, on \r\nGeorgian soil, where Georgians and Abkhazis have lived, still live and will go \r\non living together? \r\nIn the near future the General Assembly will consider a draft declaration \r\non the rights of national minorities. We are going to support it, as we \r\nsupported the corresponding resolutions of the CSCE. However, I wish to say \r\nonce again that any instrument of this kind must also contain an article on \r\nminorities\u0027 share of the responsibility for maintaining stability and peace in \r\nthe territory where they live. \r\nIt is also time to develop more precise criteria for which legal subjects \r\nare entitled to self-determination, and to introduce a practice of \r\nindependent, expert examination of the facts involved in the arbitrary \r\ninterpretation and exercise of this right. \r\nMy fifth suggestion concerns the fact that none of the above will work \r\nproperly unless more effective machinery for supporting the new democracies \r\neconomically is set up. My saying so does not detract from our gratitude to \r\nthe European and world financial institutions; it is thanks to them that we \r\nare still alive. However, facts are facts: the economies of the republics of \r\nthe former Union, are on the brink of catastrophe. The drop in production by \r\nalmost a third, in Georgia\u0027s case, the lack of fuel and raw materials and the \r\ncatastrophic increases in prices for them, the loss of traditional suppliers \r\nand markets and imminent mass unemployment set a limit to democratic \r\ntransformations. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n42 \r\n(Chairman Shevardnadze) \r\nI say to you most emphatically: the appalling economic crisis in the \r\nrepublics of the former Union will send shock waves throughout the world. If \r\nthis goes on, a social explosion of enormous force is inevitable. A change in \r\nvalues away from democracy to those of the power of the firm hand is \r\ninevitable. And for this the world will have a higher price to pay than it \r\nwould have to pay now. Let us think how we can prevent this, let us think \r\nwhat sort of system of reliable international economic insurance we can try to \r\nset up. \r\nIt is quite clear that this point must be taken into account in the \r\ninternational organizations, particularly the United Nations: it is difficult \r\nto talk about world economic stability and a single world zone of security if \r\nthe world\u0027s leading Powers do not take part. The Security Council absolutely \r\nmust exert real influence on the state of affairs. I used to come out against \r\nincreasing the number of permanent members. Now that the Soviet Union has \r\nfallen apart and the balance of power has shifted, we need to concern \r\nourselves with finding the best composition of permanent members to increase \r\nthe degree of effect that the Security Council can have on the world economic \r\nprocess, and not just on the economic process. The role of economic giants \r\nsuch as Germany and Japan will have to be rethought. \r\nI would mention in passing that the forecasts concerning certain \r\npretensions on the part of the United States of America to some kind of \r\nspecial role in the new circumstances that would allow it to impose its will \r\non the world have not proved to be accurate what I have in mind here is the \r\nprincipal, fundamental trend. The balanced foreign policy of this great \r\ncountry has not run counter to the interests of other States and, in the final \r\nanalysis, has helped maintain the balance in the interests of peace and \r\nI I I I I I I \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n43 \r\n(Chairman Shevardnadze) \r\nstability. We would like to hope that the United States will go on being a \r\nguarantee of peace, order and equilibrium in the new, extremely complex \r\nconditions and in the process of building the new world order. \r\nThe United Nations cannot stand idly by when it comes to material support \r\nfor the new democracies. Here too we need rapid deployment forces, economic \r\nones this time. The United Nations is quite within its powers to coordinate \r\nthe activities of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other \r\nregional and international institutions more effectively and on a new basis in \r\norder to give fuller support for the success of the economic reforms in the \r\nnew States that have begun that most important process, the building of \r\ndemocratic societies. \r\nMy sixth suggestion is that we are quite simply obliged to introduce into \r\nthe body of international law an instrument concerning the personal \r\nresponsibility of individuals who incite mass disorders, political brutality, \r\nhostage-taking, terrorist acts or any kind of blockade, whether economic or \r\npolitical. Our troubled times have brought these people forth. The pygmies \r\nare in revolt against humankind. This has all happened before, but the world \r\nhas never before had to face a wave of \"Messiahs\" wanting to consolidate their \r\npower on the back of the sufferings of their own people on the scale it is \r\nfacing them now. Lilliputians tying down Gullivers that is the reality in \r\nmany countries, including my own. \r\nI now come to my seventh and last suggestion. Everything I have said so \r\nfar attests to the fact that our common responsibility for peace and security \r\nrequires us to harmonize and coordinate our common efforts in the political, \r\neconomic, military, financial and ecological fields. These fields should be \r\nmanaged on four interdependent and interrelated levels: the intra-State, \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n44 \r\n(Chairman Shevardnadze) \r\nthe regional, the supraregional and the worldwide. The first level will not \r\nbecome established unless our Organization manages to find ways to support the \r\nmaking of the new democratic States. The second will be possible if there is \r\nagreement on an identity or a proximity of interests on the part of the States \r\ninvolved in regional cooperation. Organizations such as the CSCE, the \r\nOrganization of African Unity, the Organization of American States and an \r\nalliance of the countries of the Black Sea basin could form the basis for the \r\nthird level. The fourth level involves establishing a coordinating system for \r\ninteractions on a world scale, in which the principal coordinator would be the \r\nUnited Nations and its institutions. \r\nThis rostrum has always seemed very high to me. I used to feel how high \r\nit was even when the the world was ready to hang on the every word of the \r\nrepresentative of a huge and mighty Power, whatever that word might be. That \r\nis the privilege of the powerful, but I did use to try to make our words sound \r\nlike a message of good will rather than of malign force. Now that I am \r\nspeaking on behalf of a small and weak country, I feel how much higher this \r\nrostrum has grown and what a lifeline it is for my homeland. \r\nThere was a considerable element of risk involved in my present ascent of \r\nthis rostrum: things are very bad indeed back home. The bombshells of hatred \r\nare exploding all too often there. Those shells are aimed to destroy our \r\npolicy of democratically establishing and constructing an honest, just State \r\nopen to the world. Such explosions are all the more likely today, in the \r\nrun-up to parliamentary elections in which the people of the Republic of \r\nGeorgia must either endorse or reject our policy of democracy and freedom. \r\nNevertheless, I have come so that Georgia does not lose what is now its \r\nonly chance to tell the world about its hopes and aspirations, to confirm the \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n45 \r\n(Chairman Shevardnadze) \r\ntruth and refute the lie. I have come so that I can once again reaffirm my \r\ncommitment to the word we gave the world community. What of it that the scale \r\nhas diminished and the horizons have closed in? I am thinking, speaking and \r\nacting in accordance with the same principles and norms I have stood up for \r\nhere for all these years past. \r\nFinally and this will be my last personal confession I have missed \r\nyour company very, very much. \r\nI have gone over the time-limit, but the way things are is that the \r\nsmaller the size and scale of a State, the more time it needs. \r\nI thank you for hearing me out. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe Chairman of the Council of State of the Republic of Georgia for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\nMr. Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Chairman of the Council of State of the \r\nRepublic of Georgia, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n46 \r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued) \r\nGENERAL DEBATE \r\nMr. MORAVCIK (Czechoslovakia): Let me congratulate you. Sir, on \r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at its forth-seventh \r\nsession. I wish you much success and promise you full support. \r\nI thank your predecessor, Mr. Shihabi, for guiding the General Assembly \r\nto success at its forth-sixth session. \r\nThe past year weakened further the illusion that the end of the cold war \r\nwould facilitate a speedy and effective solution of problems that built up \r\nduring the post-war period. It has been a sobering year, during which we have \r\nbeen involved in the gradual process of getting acquainted with the possible. \r\nSometimes we see euphoria replaced by total pessimism and little faith. \r\nWhile the era of bipolarity is over and democracy is winning, many \r\nconflicts remain unresolved, and a new generation of conflicts is beginning. \r\nIn addition to conflicts with which we have dealt routinely, but \r\nunsuccessfully, over the years, we are now witnesssing a great variety of \r\nwars. The number of zones of conflict gets larger and larger. \r\nNagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria, South Ossetia, Abkhasia and Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina mainly Bosnia and Herzegovina - are new symbols of violence to \r\nwhich we have no answers. \r\nThe United Nations, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\n(CSCE), the European Communities, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \r\n(NATO), the Western European Union (WEU) and the Council of Europe are unable, \r\ndespite all their commendable efforts, to exert sufficient pressure to secure \r\nthe desired solutions to these tragedies. In this respect, there has been \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Moravcik. Czechoslovakia) \r\ngrowing impatience and anxiety, as well as dissatisfaction and criticism, on \r\nthe part of the public and the mass media. It has become routine to question \r\nthe role of international institutions as instruments that are suitable for \r\nconflict management. Let us be frank about this: we face a problem of \r\ncredibility. Much will be at stake if we fail to deal immediately with it.* \r\nThere is a risk that a very typical challenge of the 1990s the \r\nrelationship between statehood and nationhood will become a phenomenon of \r\nworld politics that defies efficient international regulation. In this \r\nrespect in particular, international institutions have a fundamental role to \r\nplay in providing a guarantee that the processes will develop on a basis of \r\ndemocracy and of respect for universal and civilized human values. \r\nHowever, it would be a mistake to start the search for solutions by \r\nchallenging international institutions as such. It would be a mistake to \r\ndecide to modify the United Nations radically and rebuild it by rejecting the \r\nwisdom of its founding fathers, as embodied in the Charter. The claim that \r\nrevitalization of the United Nations requires not a change in the Charter but, \r\non the contrary, full implementation of the Charter is often considered to be \r\na cliche. I regard it not as a cliche but as a wise approach, indicating not \r\nrigidity but, rather, a willingness to exploit fully the political potential \r\nof the Charter. \r\nIt is true that the Charter makes no explicit reference to drugs, \r\norganized crime, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), indebtedness \r\nor the widening gap between the haves and the have-nots. However, it contains \r\nMr. Cetin (Turkey), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n48 \r\n(Mr. Moravcik. Czechoslovakia) \r\nfundamental political principles on the basis of which these problems can and \r\nshould be solved. To that end, the things that are lacking are sometimes \r\ninstruments, sometimes money and very often the political will. What is \r\nneeded is - in short - a change in our approach to the priorities of the \r\nactivities of the Organization. \r\nIt is in this climate that the Secretary-General\u0027s report the \"Agenda \r\nfor Peace\" - has come into our hands. The recommendations contained in that \r\nreport provide useful guidelines for effective exploitation of the Charter\u0027s \r\npotential. I believe that the section dealing with the prevention of conflict \r\nrequires elaboration, as it has been demonstrated that activity in this field \r\nwill increasingly become one of the basic orientations of multilateral \r\ndiplomacy. \r\nIn summary, the Secretary-General\u0027s report deals with confidence-building \r\nmeasures, fact-finding, early warning and preventive diplomacy. I am familiar \r\nwith these terms as the CSCE, at its third summit, held in Helsinki, firmly \r\nincorporated them into the list of its instruments. \r\nMention of the CSCE brings me to a question that Czechoslovakia has \r\nproposed as a new item for the General Assembly\u0027s agenda - coordination of the \r\nactivities of the United Nations and the Conference on Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe. In this connection, let me take the former Yugoslavia \r\nas an example. Several times, in my capacity as Chairman of the CSCE Council \r\nof Ministers, I have come across situations in which activities of the United \r\nNations and activities of the CSCE overlap. Naturally, such overlapping has \r\nreduced the effectiveness of those activities. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n49-50 \r\n(Mr. Moravcik. Czechoslovakia! \r\nMy meetings with Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the United Nations Special \r\nRapporteur for Human Rights in the former Yugoslavia, clearly demonstrated a \r\nneed for, and an interest in, regular coordination of United missions with \r\nthose of the CSCE. In this connection, I should say that the United Nations \r\nmade an excellent choice when it picked Mr. Mazowiecki for its human-rights \r\nactivities in this explosive area. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. Moravcik. Czechoslovakia) \r\nHowever, this problem does not concern just the former Yugoslavia. Like \r\nthe CSCE, the United Nations has sent missions to Nagorno-Karabakh and \r\nTransnistria. As the aims of all these missions have been coordinated only in \r\noutline, it is no wonder that the parties to the conflict often fail to \r\nunderstand the purpose of these foreign delegations coming to see them and \r\nasking the same questions. It is often unclear how they differ. \r\nThe CSCE summit that took place in Helsinki in July laid the basis for \r\nimproved cooperation between the United Nations and the CSCE, as well as other \r\nother organizations NATO, the Western European Union (WEU) and the Council \r\nof Europe. The need for such interaction resulted in the London Conference on \r\nthe former Yugoslavia. This was the first example of systematic cooperation \r\nbetween three international organizations, and it amounted to the first \r\ninterlocking acion by the European Community, the United Nations and the \r\nCSCE. As the London Conference was attended also by the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference and the International Red Cross as a non-governmental \r\norganization, I see it as the germ of a loose system of cooperation between \r\nvarious institutions. \r\nIt seems to me that the time is right to consider seriously the convening \r\nof an informal \"brainstorming\" meeting of the United Nations, the CSCE, the \r\nEuropean Community, NATO, the WEU and the Council of Europe to discuss the \r\nidea of an interlocking system of international organizations. The purpose of \r\nthe proposed General Assembly agenda item on coordination between the United \r\nNations and the CSCE is not simply to secure a resolution. In my opinion, \r\nthat discussion of the issue at this session could develop at two levels - the \r\nconceptual level, at which the fundamental political meaning of coordination, \r\nboth in the immediate future and in the light of medium-term and long-term \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. Moravcik. Czechoslovakia) \r\nprospects, could be clarified; and the practical level, at which the \r\nactivities of the two institutions have already begun to overlap, making it \r\npossible to draw conclusions. \r\nIt will certainly be in the interests of the United Nations and of the \r\nCSCE to have the meaning of \"preventive diplomacy\" and \"early warning\" \r\nclarified. These terms have already taken on a very definite meaning at the \r\nCSCE, and the majority of United Nations Member States, as they do not \r\nparticipate in the CSCE, will probably want to become acquainted with them. \r\nThe conceptual discussion might focus also on the relationship between \r\nthe United Nations and the CSCE as institutions each of which has the task of \r\nlooking after the security of its members. This is especially so as the CSCE \r\nnow covers an area stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok. \r\nFor the purpose of getting the discussion under way, I should like, in my \r\nnational capacity, to put forward some ideas. Whenever the Security Council \r\nwishes to discuss a security issue within the competence of the CSCE, a \r\nrepresentative of the CSCE should be invited to provide the Council with the \r\nnecessary information on any CSCE activities in respect of that issue or \r\notherwise to contribute to the work of the Council. The Council and its \r\nPresident, as well as the United Nations Secretary-General, should be kept \r\nconstantly informed of the main activities of the CSCE, and the reverse should \r\napply. \r\nCoordination of the human-rights activities of the United Nations and of \r\nthe CSCE could be improved by, for example, regular CSCE participation at \r\nmeetings of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and its committees, \r\nthe Economic and Social Council and the Third Committee of the General \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Moravcik. Czechoslovakia) \r\nAssembly. And is there any reason why we should not establish working \r\ncontacts between the United Nations Centre for Human Rights in Geneva and the \r\nCSCE\u0027s Warsaw Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights? \r\nIn addition, one of the main elements of the CSCE\u0027s early-warning \r\nsystem the High Commissioner on National Minorities might have some link \r\nwith the United Nations. Indeed, at the appropriate time, that might even be \r\nturned into an institutional link. In the long term, the CSCE human-rights \r\ninstitutions, structures and mechanisms could become tools of both the United \r\nNations and the Council of Europe. \r\nSuch discussion as I have suggested could dispel the fear of United \r\nNations Member States which do not participate in the CSCE that the Helsinki \r\nprocess is an elite club that institutionalizes the gap between the rich North \r\nand the poor South. \r\nWe must also ensure that there is a proper understanding of the \r\npeace-keeping role of the CSCE vis-a-vis that of the United Nations. The most \r\nrecent reason for this comparison is to be found in President Bush\u0027s statement \r\nto the General Assembly on Monday, in which he suggested that the \r\npeace-keeping function of the United Nations should be expanded considerably. \r\nThe peace-keeping concept of the United Nations is not identical to that of \r\nthe CSCE, and I believe that there is a good prospect of their becoming \r\ncomplementary. It should be remembered that, in this respect, the North \r\nAtlantic Alliance and the Western European Union have made important offers. \r\nIt is unlikely that we shall be able to avoid having a debate on \r\npeacemaking and peace-keeping. The crisis in the former Yugoslavia \r\nnecessitates a really serious discussion of this question. It is unnecessary \r\nfor me to reiterate my country\u0027s full support for the United Nations \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n54-55 \r\n(Mr. Moravcik. Czechoslovakia) \r\npeace-keeping operations, as there are Czech and Slovak \"blue helmets\" in the \r\nformer Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia has contributed to the United Nations \r\noperations in Angola, Somalia and Iraq. To be of practical benefit, \r\ndiscussion of the interaction between the United Nations and the CSCE should \r\ntake place annually. \r\nIn today\u0027s world the United Nations can play an even more important role \r\nin arms control and disarmament. I am thinking especially of the Convention \r\non the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of \r\nBacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction. When \r\nthe United Nations Register of Conventional Arms becomes operational, it will \r\nhave a substantial role to play. \r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s report, \"An Agenda for Peace\", says, \"globalism \r\nand nationalism need not be viewed as opposing trends\" (para. 19). These \r\nwords attracted my attention as they reflect one of the peculiarities of our \r\ntimes. They embody the historical experience of the two nations of \r\nCzechoslovakia experience that I should like to share with members. \r\nThe idea of the right of nations to self-determination advanced by \r\nPresident Wilson facilitated the disintegration of the former Austro-Hungarian \r\nmonarchy, thus opening up the way for the creation of Czechoslavakia. That \r\nwas 74 years ago. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n56 \r\n(Mr. Moravcik. Czechoslovakia) \r\nCzechoslovakia emerged, however, under the influence of the notion that \r\nthere was a Czechoslovak nation, whereas it should have been admitted that \r\nthere were two distinct nations the Czechs and the Slovaks. But the idea of \r\nCzechoslovakism, which resulted in the creation of a common State for the \r\nworld\u0027s two closest Slavic nations, impeded relations between those nations. \r\nThus a specific Czecho-Slovak problem was born, and it remains unresolved. \r\nAt about the same time, communism tied nations together by means of the \r\nfalse idea of proletarian internationalism. This was bound to affect \r\nrelations between the Czechs and the Slovaks. However, our experience \r\nindicates that communism was not the root of these problems; it simply gave \r\nthem a new dimension. Many nations are now searching for a new role in Europe \r\nand in the world by seeking integration into larger economic entities and \r\npolitical groups. \r\nI believe that, so far as Czechoslovakia is concerned, one possible \r\nsolution lies in the replacement of the existing federalist pattern by new \r\nties. Understanding and viable coexistence between nations cannot be based on \r\nfalse and outdated ideas. Czechoslovakia is therefore preparing to establish \r\ntwo closely connected sovereign States by creating a common economy space and \r\nretaining intact the close contacts between the peoples of the two republics. \r\nWe want to introduce elements of European integration into the relations \r\nbetween the republics. \r\nWhat is now taking place in Czechoslovakia is a process aimed at the \r\ncreation of a solid basis for a model of integration such as has been \r\ndeveloping democratically in Western Europe and has led to the creation and \r\ndevelopment of the European Communities. \r\nminim \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Moravcik. Czechoslovakia) \r\nGlobalism and nationalism are not necessarily opposing trends, provided \r\nthat the right to self-determination is accompanied by the desire for closer \r\ncooperation with other nations and by efficient participation in international \r\nsystems of guaranteeing the basic values upon which the world and especially \r\nthe fragile structure of peace are built. We live in an era of global \r\nintegration comprising different subsystems, among which the United Nations \r\nhas an irreplaceable role to play. \r\nI should like, in conclusion, to say that this statement is a sort of \r\nfarewell speech of the Czechoslovak federation to the United Nations. It is \r\nhighly probable that by January of next year the federation will have ceased \r\nto exist. Thus one of the founding members of the United Nations will give \r\nits place in international politics to the two new independent States. It is \r\nmy hope that all the current Members of the United Nations will extend to the \r\nCzech republic and the Slovak republic the understanding that they have always \r\nshown to Czechoslovakia, by admitting them to membership as soon as possible. \r\nMr. MOUSSA (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic): At the outset, I \r\nwish to convey the Egyptian Government\u0027s congratulations to the Presidency of \r\nBulgaria on the election to the presidency of the General Assembly of \r\nMr. Ganev and his assumption of that high post. \r\nI should like also to put on record our appreciaiton of the capable \r\nmanner in which Mr. Samir Shihabi, the permanent representative of the Kingdom \r\nof Saudi Arabia, conducted the work of the Assembly at its last session. \r\nIn addition, I want to congratulate the States that have recently joined \r\nthe United Nations. I hope that they will participate effectively and \r\nconstructively in the activities of the Organization and in defence of the \r\npurposes and principles of its Charter. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr. Moussa. Egypt) \r\nThis session, like past sessions and those that will follow in the 1990s, \r\nis of great importance. It is being held at a stage of evolution and change \r\ncharacterized by unprecedented dynamism and speed. It is a transitional stage \r\nin the course of which new patterns of international relations are being \r\nmoulded. Hence, what the current session of the General Assembly is \r\nwitnessing is not a stable international situation but, rather, a phase in a \r\ncontinuing process of evolution and change. Consequently, it is difficult to \r\npredict with any certainty what the years and decades to come may hold for the \r\nfuture of the world and its order. \r\nThis uninterrupted process of change, however, requires the reaffirmation \r\nof certain matters which, in our view, constitute the basics which should \r\ndetermine the image of the future. \r\nThe process of change should have a human content. No progress or \r\ncivilization could have a point of departure other than respect for man, his \r\nrights, freedoms and dignity without discrimination because of colour, creed \r\nor religion. Only in a context of respect for peoples\u0027 rights, cultures and \r\nachievements and for their right to have their just demands met can there be \r\nany change or progress. \r\nInternational cooperation and interdependence based on justice and \r\nfairness constitute the basis for salubrious change and for positive movement \r\ntowards any breakthrough of the future. \r\nIn the context of the existing challenges, international peace and \r\nsecurity are the collective responsibility of North and South, which should \r\nshoulder their burdens and obligations and, thereafter, share the dividends of \r\nsuccess. Undoubtedly, the ever-increasing role of the Security Council \r\nnecessitates a review of its membership and the scope of its responsibility, \r\nso that it may be a genuine reflection of international and regional forces. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n59-60 \r\n(Mr. Moussa. Egypt-) \r\nIn their new concept, international relations should be integral in \r\nsubstance, rational in content and democratic in context. Therefore, the \r\nformulation of those relations requires collective participation if they are \r\nto reflect the interests of the international community, with all its \r\ncomponents, and of the balance between rights and duties and between power and \r\nresponsibility. \r\nInternational relations, in their current state of evolution, reflect a \r\ngreater awareness and wider recognition of the relationship between future and \r\ndestiny. Similarly, they reflect constant movement towards realism in dealing \r\nwith inherited and nascent dilemmas. Nevertheless, they have been unable to \r\nremove elements of suspicion and feelings of frustration. Rather, they have \r\nhelped to exacerbate such feelings in many places and about many issues, \r\nespecially in the third world. \r\nA/47 /PV. 12 \r\n61 \r\n(Mr. Moussa. Egypt) \r\nWhile the seeds of change indicate a relaxation of global military \r\nconfrontations, at the same time, they have crystallized the inherited \r\nsediments of regional and ethnic tensions and have transformed the equation of \r\nrivalry between East and West into an equation between North and South that \r\nhas not taken final shape yet as it has not dealt, and does not seem to be \r\ngoing to deal, rationally, with the massive historic imbalances between \r\nregions of affluence and regions of scarcity, between regions of progress and \r\nthose of backwardness. Indeed, there is genuine concern that unless it takes \r\nplace under agreed controls, the ongoing process of change, will lead to the \r\ncodification of these imbalances and, thereby, make them a feature of the new \r\nworld order, with all that that would entail in terms of turmoil and chaos. \r\nThese features of today\u0027s world, and portents of tomorrow\u0027s world, give \r\nrise to very real fears regarding the dominance of injustice and inequality in \r\ninternational relations on the political, security, economic and social levels. \r\nAfter this foreword, which reflects the feelings of the third world, \r\nEgypt\u0027s delegation would like to discuss four issues: the state of affairs in \r\nthe United Nations; the situation in the third world; disarmament; and peace \r\nefforts in the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Europe. \r\nIt is highly important that the purposes of the Charter be made the \r\nfoundation of the new era, so that justice may be ensured, social progress \r\npromoted and better standards of living achieved in greater freedom as \r\nexpressed by the Secretary-General in his Agenda for Peace. In our view, this \r\nis the real core of positive development and of any world order that strives \r\nfor stability and peace. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Moussa. Egypt) \r\nThe purposes of the Charter, however, cannot be realized, and the strong \r\ndesire to ensure justice and to promote social and economic progress cannot be \r\nfulfilled, in an age in which acute racialist trends rear their heads anew, in \r\nwhich dangers threaten the lives of whole communities, and in which there are \r\nsigns of a return to foreign intervention in the affairs of States and of \r\npeoples. \r\nHence, foremost among the main goals highlighted by the Secretary-General \r\nin his plan is action to deal, in a wider context, with the deepest causes of \r\ntension economic deprivation and social injustice. Dealing with these banes \r\nshould be the cornerstone of the new world era. In this connection, I should \r\nlike to voice our strong support for a statement made by the \r\nSecretary-General a statement that seems to have commanded insufficient \r\nconsideration and appreciation. The Secretary-General said: \r\n\"It is noticeable that there is a common moral concept which is \r\nincreasingly emerging and spreading among the world\u0027s peoples and \r\nnations. It is reflected in international laws, most of which have \r\nemerged through efforts made by the United Nations.\" \r\nThis statement deals with an issue on which, in our view, we should \r\nreflect, for we are in real need of a common moral concept. For many decades, \r\nthe world has been plagued by policies of racial discrimination. Now is the \r\ntime, the opportunity, to rid ourselves of those policies. Unfortunately, \r\nhowever, other racial conflicts have erupted, and there have been calls for \r\nethnic purity. This shows that the world still lacks a common moral concept \r\nand the means of developing it in a rational and sound way. \r\nSuch a concept should be based on consensus among our various societies, \r\nand it should be developed within the framework of our political experience \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. Moussa. Egypt) \r\nsince the Second World War. It should also be based on an analysis of all \r\nthat has been achieved and all that has not been achieved, with a view to \r\nassessing the role played by.existing human-rights instruments and deciding \r\nwhether to develop such instruments further or to replace them with new ones. \r\nWe need a new world social contract between various world communities, \r\ncultures and civilizations. This new social contract should be based not on \r\none model, no matter how successful such a model may have proved to be, but on \r\nrules upon which there is common agreement and which take into consideration \r\nthe intrinsic characteristics of various societies, with a view to devising \r\nthe best framework for the achievement of unity through diversity. In this \r\nway, we would define \"respect for human rights\" with reference to a concept \r\nshared and approved by all a concept that all would contract to implement. \r\nThe new world social contract for which we call a contract linking \r\nparties from different civilizations and cultures should be constructed \r\nwithin the framework of the new era in which neither globalism and nationalism \r\nnor commonality and individuality should be regarded as opposing trends, but \r\nshould be discussed from the point of view of peaceful evolution, equilibrium \r\nand respect for the purposes of the Charter. \r\nI strongly believe that calling for a new social contract is linked \r\norganically with the preventive diplomacy, participation in peacemaking and \r\ncontribution to peace-keeping called for in the Agenda for Peace. \r\nThe vision that the Secretary-General has put forth last June in his \r\nAgenda for Peace reflects hope as much as it reflects challenges. \r\nThis vision embodies a call for the development of the role of the United \r\nNations from one of mere crisis management and conflict resolution to a more \r\ncomprehensive one which would embrace social, economic and humanitarian \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n64 \r\n(Mr. Moussa. Egypt-) \r\nissues. It is a vision that presents newly developed dimensions imposed by \r\nthe nature of the profound changes now taking place in the patterns of \r\ninternational relations. \r\nThere should be a comprehensive and in-depth debate on this report and on \r\nthe quintessence of this vision of the future. This debate should take place \r\nin the General Assembly and the Security Council, as well as in the various \r\nbodies of the United Nations, side by side with intensive examination in many \r\nother forums. It should involve research institutes in various States and \r\ncontinents, and should be aimed at reaching an acceptable formula to meet the \r\npolitical, security, economic and social requirements of the next stage in the \r\nhistory of the world. \r\nThis Agenda for Peace keeps hope alive and sets concrete goals. It is \r\ncharacterized by the fact that it does not ignore or overlook the realities of \r\nthe situation. It strikes a balance between the possible and the desirable, \r\nand it constitutes a prelude to the major aim of adapting the existing \r\ninstruments to the new realities. \r\nThe international community, which accepts even calls for - greater \r\nresponsibility in the resolution of global and regional conflicts, also calls \r\nfor an effective role for the United Nations in preventing wars and making \r\npeace. \r\nRespect for the United Nations involves, by definition, respect for its \r\nresolutions and the mobilization of its collective will to implement those \r\nresolutions with a view to imposing peace, if necessary, or negotiating peace \r\nif intentions are genuine and the parties concerned cooperate. \r\nA/47/PV. 12 \r\n65 \r\n(Mr. Moussa. Egypt) \r\nIn the midst of all this, we find the problems nay, problem of the third \r\nworld which is one of the most important issues we have to discuss in this \r\nforum that brings together all the peoples and nations of the world. \r\nIn recent weeks the third world has convened a summit meeting in \r\nIndonesia, in the framework of the Non-Aligned Movement. President Soeharto \r\naddressed the Assembly in detail, yesterday, on the meeting, in his capacity \r\nas head of the Non-Aligned Movement. Today, I wish to dwell on a few points: \r\nfirst, the new world order should be based on solid foundations of law and on \r\nthe principles of the Charter, as well as on an equitable sharing of \r\nresponsibility and a joint commitment to cooperation and solidarity; secondly, \r\nthe structure of that order should be dedicated to peace and justice, security \r\nand development and democracy at the domestic national levels, and in \r\ninternational relations, as well as to the promotion of the fundamental rights \r\nand freedoms of individual human beings and peoples; \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n66 \r\n(Mr. Moussa. Egypt) \r\nthirdly, respect for sovereignty and adherence to the principle of \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other States as a principle that \r\nshould not be impaired or diminished; fourthly, settlement of disputes by \r\npeaceful means and through continued dialogue and negotiation; fifthly, peace \r\nand stability are contingent on social and economic factors as much as they \r\nare contingent on political and military factors. Therefore, the diminishing \r\nprospects of economic development and social progress result in a serious \r\nthreat to stability, and hence, to peace; sixthly, support for holding a world \r\nsummit on social development that would put people and their social needs at \r\nthe forefront of international efforts, and provide an opportunity to deal \r\nwith the multi-faceted dimensions of social issues; seventhly, the United \r\nNations, as the world embodiment of multilateralism, has a unique opportunity \r\nto be the international collective instrument for establishing a new world \r\norder based on justice and equality. \r\nHerein lies the link between the Agenda for Peace and the hopes and \r\naspirations of the third world for a positive role through which it would \r\ncontribute to building the new world order. We believe that the establishment \r\nof this order cannot and should not be realized through imposition or \r\ncoercion, but rather through a democratic process in which all peoples and \r\nStates of the world would have a role and a say. This can be achieved only \r\nthrough this Organization: the United Nations. \r\nIn today\u0027s world, there exists a great tide towards disarmament and \r\ntangible progress towards agreement on its mechanisms and the achievement of \r\nits aims which, for long, have been sought by developed and developing nations \r\nalike. Third world States, represented by the Non-Aligned Movement and the \r\nGroup of 77, have made abundantly clear their determination to give priority \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n67 \r\n(Mr. Moussa. Egypt) \r\nto disarmament issues, particularly nuclear disarmament, and the rechannelling \r\nof released resources to the areas of development and to the achievement of \r\nsocio-economic progress. \r\nToday, at this very same session, the new world is trying to take yet \r\nanother step in that direction by introducing the Convention on the \r\nProhibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical \r\nWeapons and on Their Destruction. Egypt, which was one of the first States \r\nthat participated in drafting this Convention and which called for the \r\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and for the elimination of weapons \r\nof mass destruction, should like to present to the General Assembly our \r\nregional view of this Convention. \r\nFirst, we are in favour of moving towards chemical-weapons disarmament in \r\nthe framework of an international Convention that would constitute a part of \r\nan evolving and comprehensive process of disarmament towards general and \r\ncomplete disarmament, particularly of weapons of mass destruction; \r\nSecondly, we agree with the framework and content of the Convention as \r\npresented by the Conference on Disarmament; \r\nThirdly, however, from our regional perspective, we consider that this \r\nConvention should not be dealt with in isolation from other efforts related to \r\nother weapons of mass destruction, mainly the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons, the international system of safeguards and inspection, and \r\nthe provision of credible international guarantees; \r\nFourthly, we have a declared initiative regarding the establishment of a \r\nzone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, including \r\nnuclear, chemical and biological weapons and other delivery systems. \r\nTherefore, our view of the Convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons \r\ncomes within this overall framework and is an integral part of it; \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n68 \r\n(Mr. Moussa. Egypt) \r\nFifthly, Middle East Arab and non-Arab States, with the exception of one, \r\nhave joined the international system of inspection or the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Thus their support for the disarmament \r\nprocess is evident. However, the existing exception of one State gives rise \r\nto many security concerns, particularly as we know that this exception enables \r\none State in the Middle East to possess nuclear weapons without any \r\ninternational restrictions. It also enables this State, which possesses a \r\nmassive arsenal of military industries, to be engaged in a process of missile \r\ndevelopment in a manner that makes it an enshrined exception in the framework \r\nof the disarmament process. This greatly negates the effectiveness of all \r\ndisarmament operational instruments and threatens the whole concept of \r\nregional and even international disarmament. It also restricts the freedom of \r\nthe region\u0027s States in acceding to the Convention on the prohibition of \r\nchemical weapons; \r\nSixthly, against this backdrop, the ministerial meeting of the League of \r\nArab States conducted an in-depth discussion of this issue in mid-September. \r\nThe meeting approved the following points as a basis for the Arab position \r\ntowards the Convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons: full \r\nwillingness to deal with all disarmament proposals that would provide security \r\nthrough equal obligations applicable by one standard to all the States of the \r\nregion; reaffirmation of full support for the elimination of all weapons of \r\nmass destruction from the Middle East, including nuclear, chemical and \r\nbiological weapons, as the best way to achieve security for all the States of \r\nthe region; and willingness to deal with the Convention on the prohibition of \r\nchemical weapons and the framework of efforts aiming at the establishment of \r\nthe zone to the extent that the excepted State, namely Israel, would respond \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n69 \r\n(Mr. Moussa. Egypt) \r\nto international calls to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons and to subject its nuclear facilities to the international \r\nsafeguards system. \r\nThat is our position towards the Convention on the prohibition of \r\nchemical weapons. It is a position of support, but within the framework of an \r\nintegrated disarmament process at the regional level in order to maintain the \r\nsecurity of the Middle East States that are threatened by the existence of \r\nnuclear weapons in their region without any international control or legal \r\nobligation. \r\nStill dealing with the Middle East region, I should like to say that the \r\nstage through which the region is passing now is characterized by many \r\npositive elements as well as negative ones. \r\nIn connection with the Middle East problem and the Palestine question, \r\nnegotiations are currently under way, bilaterally and multilaterally, within \r\nthe framework of a peace process based on the land-for-peace formula, and on \r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), adopted in the \r\nframework of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. They \r\nclearly provide for inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war, \r\nand thus safeguard the sovereign rights and territorial integrity of all, \r\nthrough withdrawal from the territories occupied in 1967; and for the right of \r\neach State in the region to live in peace within its internationally \r\nguaranteed borders, thus ensuring security for all, Israel and Arab States \r\nalike. \r\nIn fact, the Government of Mr. Yitzhak Rabin has moved in the right \r\ndirection, dissipating clouds of uncertainty and clearing the way for hope and \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n70 \r\n(Mr. Moussa. Egypt) \r\noptimism. A basis of credibility has thus been created for the negotiations. \r\nThat credibility was about to be lost indefinitely because of the actions of \r\nthe previous Israeli Government and the former Prime Minister\u0027s statement that \r\nhis intention was to procrastinate for 10 years. \r\nHowever, it is not only the atmosphere of the negotiations that is \r\nimportant but also the content of those negotiations, particularly in view of \r\nthe fact that the Arab parties, mainly Syria, have agreed to enter into \r\ncomprehensive peace agreements with Israel, provided that the latter adheres \r\nto its obligations under the Charter, and international law as well as to the \r\nunanimous international resolutions that stipulate withdrawal to the \r\ninternational boundaries and the recognition of the legitimate rights of the \r\nPalestinian people. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n71 \r\n(Mr. Moussa. Egypt) \r\nEgypt has set out in detail its integrated view of the components of a \r\ncomprehensive peace based on the elements of security and justice in \r\naccordance with the following principles: \r\nFirst, that the Arab-Israeli conflict in its entirety has four \r\ncomponents: land, Palestinian rights, security for all, and regional \r\ncooperation in the framework of peace; \r\nSecondly, the need to implement the Security Council resolutions which \r\nrepresent the acceptable terms of reference for a negotiating process based on \r\nthe formula of land for peace; \r\nThirdly, the special status of Al-Quds city does not prejudice the fact \r\nthat East Jerusalem is a part of the territories occupied since mid-1967. The \r\nprinciples of any settlement are as applicable to it as they are to any other \r\npart of the occupied territories. Its future is not to be foreclosed nor \r\ndecided upon unilaterally. Consequently, it represents an area of the peace \r\nnegotiations, whether in the interim stage or in the final stage, of a \r\nPalestinian-Israeli settlement; \r\nFourthly, a settlement should be comprehensive for all fronts, including \r\nthe Golan, Gaza and the West Bank, the Jordanian territories and South \r\nLebanon, under Security Council resolution 425 (1978), and the behests of \r\ninternational legality. \r\nFifthly, interim arrangements in the context of the talks on full \r\nautonomy should be made without prejudice to the right of the Palestinian \r\npeoples to decide their own future and the exercise of their right to self \r\ndetermination; \r\nSixthly, the problem of the post-1948 war Palestinian refugees and the \r\npersons displaced after the 1967 war should be dealt with in conformity with \r\nresolutions based on international law and consensus based on good faith. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n72 \r\n(Mr. Moussa. Egypt-) \r\nThe Egyptian view of a future Middle East within the context of new \r\ninternational relations, as well as the context of cultural affinity and the \r\nhistorical ties that bind all Arab States, together with Egypt\u0027s peaceful \r\nrelations with Israel, enable Egypt to play an active role in the peace \r\nprocess and to provide some support for the negotiations to fulfill the \r\nlegitimate demands called for under Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) \r\nand 338 (1973) and the land-for-peace formula. So much for the problem of the \r\nMiddle East and Palestine. \r\nAs for the Gulf region, which is part of the Middle East, we witness new \r\ntensions caused by Iran\u0027s occupation of Arab islands, the latest of which was \r\nAbu-Moussa. This is a development we can neither overlook nor ignore. We \r\ntherefore call upon Iran to reconsider its position on this issue, to adhere \r\nto the principles of good- neighbourliness, to respect the norms of \r\ninternational law and the sovereiegnty of States over their territories and to \r\nrestore the situation to the status quo ante. We hope that the course of \r\nrelations between Iran and the Arab peoples will be one of friendship, \r\nbrotherhood and cooperation. These peoples have much in common to make them \r\nmore united than otherwise. \r\nAmidst these omens for the region, we in Egypt are concerned about the \r\nfate of all segments of the the Iraqi people and all parts of its land. \r\nTherefore, while we call upon the Iraqi Government to abide by the rules and \r\ndecisions of international legality, we call upon the international community \r\nto safeguard Iraq\u0027s territorial integrity and the unity of its people. In the \r\nsame way, we support Kuwait\u0027s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its \r\ninternational borders. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n73 \r\n(Mr. Moussa. Egypt) \r\nAs we discuss the major issues facing the world of today, I cannot but \r\nrefer to the situation in Africa. The African continent, and particularly in \r\nthe Horn of Africa, faces a range of political, economic and social problems. \r\nThe situation cries out for increased attention to be paid to the continent on \r\nthe part of the international community. In the meantime, the democratic \r\nchanges in the continent and its States\u0027 awareness of the need for continental \r\nand regional cooperation gives us confidence that Africa has the capability to \r\nrise to the challenge. I therefore urge the international community to \r\nshoulder its reponsiblities towards implementing the Second Industrial \r\nDevelopment Decade for Africa in the 1990s in order to accelerate the \r\ntransition to democracy and the economic and social development in the \r\ncountries of the continent. \r\nAt the same time, progress in the process of eliminating apartheid is a \r\npositive aspect amidst such drawbacks. It should not be hampered by the \r\nattempts of racial extremists. The people of South Africa are on their way to \r\nexercising their legitimate rights. Incidents of violence or apostasy must \r\nnot stop the positive evolution. Our responsiblity is to support the process \r\nof dialogue and negotiations in order to restore the momentum needed for \r\nachieving a democratic non-racial society in South Africa. \r\nLast but not least, the situation in Somalia requires more than the mere \r\nhumanitarian assistance to which we all contribute. What we need is to \r\nintensify efforts to achieve national reconciliation. While we call on the \r\ninternational community to continue its efforts in the humanitarian field, we \r\ncall upon the Somali parties to rise to the responsibility of forging sound \r\nrelations between them and discarding the trival rivalries and power struggles \r\nwhich show a lack of national awareness. \r\nA/47/PV.12 \r\n74 \r\n(Mr. Moussa. Egypt-) \r\nBy the same token, we stand firmly against aggression and in defence of \r\nrespecting the sovereignty and independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and are \r\ncommitted to stopping attempts at interference in its internal affiars, as \r\nwell as the practices of \"ethnic cleansing\" committeed against its people, \r\nwhich reflect an attitude of inherited racial bigotry, intellectual \r\nbackwardness and cultural regression. The demise of Yugoslavia, though \r\nregrettable in view of its past contributions to international life, makes it \r\nincumbent upon us to work for the respect of equal rights for all its peoples \r\nand all the States that have emanated from it, as all of them, not only one, \r\nare its successors in the world order. A view that has already been adopted \r\nby the General Assembly. \r\nThese are the issues that are of concern to us in Europe, Africa and Asia. \r\nWe are at the threshold of a world which looks forward to stabiity, but \r\nis in a transitional period in the course of which the map of tomorrow may be \r\nredrawn. Chaos may erupt and States, ethnic groupings, and terrorists may \r\nresort to force to an attempt to halt the march of history, civilization and \r\nprogress. But the collective will shall open the doors to the United Nations \r\nand, thereby, will allow us to opt for a better tomorrow of unhampered \r\neconomic development and social interdependence wherein we shall protect the \r\nenvironment, guided by the principles and obligations of the Rio de Janeiro \r\nsummit meeting; a better tomorrow of respect for human rights; a better \r\ntomorrow that all of us will participate in bringing about for the sake of the \r\nworld we aspire after in the twenty-first century. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m. \r\n"
