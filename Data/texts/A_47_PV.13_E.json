President of Mongolia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations the President of Mongolia, His Excellency \r\nMr. Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\nPresident OCHIRBAT (spoke in Mongolian, English text furnished by \r\nthe delegation): Allow me at the outset to convey to you. Sir, my \r\ndelegation\u0027s sincere congratulations on your unanimous election to the high \r\npost of President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. \r\nWe are indebted to Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, whose \r\nskilful and indomitable leadership contributed a great deal to the success of \r\nthe last session of the General Assembly. \r\nI extend congratulations and best wishes to the representatives of the \r\nnew States Members of the United Nations: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of \r\nMoldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. \r\nMongolia commends Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his dynamic \r\nperformance. He has assumed the responsibilities of his post at a time when \r\nthe Organization is regaining its effectiveness, and the objective of its \r\ndemocratization and restructuring becomes increasingly topical. I wish you \r\nsuccess, Mr. Secretary-General, in your endeavours. \r\nI feel honoured and privilieged to address this Assembly of nations \r\ntoday, at a time of renewed hope in the world Organization and recommitment to \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n3 \r\n(President Ochirbat) \r\nthe underlying purposes and principles of its Charter. I have come to this \r\nsession of the General Assembly to tell the world community about Mongolia\u0027s \r\ndomestic and external policies and its approaches to current international \r\nissues and to express Mongolia\u0027s full support for the principles and \r\nactivities of the United Nations. \r\nAs the wheel of history turns, mankind finds itself on the threshold of \r\nthe third millennium. The century that started with a fierce struggle waged \r\nby the workers\u0027 movement and was two brutal world wars, a powerful movement \r\nfor independence and dramatic scientific and technological breakthroughs is \r\nculminating now with a new wave of human rights, freedom and democracy. \r\nOver the past several decades the world was divided into two antagonisitc \r\ncamps that grew into two powerful, confrontational alliances, but now it has \r\nwitnessed the end of the cold war. One could hardly find a country in the \r\nworld that had not been drawn into this truly global face-off. \r\nBy indulging in ideological hostilities and a reckless arms race, mankind \r\nbrought itself to the brink of self-destruction and wasted vast resources, \r\nmany opportunities and much time, thereby hampering world economic development \r\nand social progress and damaging the environment. On the other hand, the \r\ncolonial system collapsed and many Asian, African and Latin American countries \r\ngained independence and strengthened their positions in the international \r\narena. Mankind has reached into outer space and started taming nuclear \r\nenergy. The positive and negative effects of all this have been reflected in \r\nthe activities of the United Nations, the mirror of world tendencies and \r\ninternational relations. \r\nThe East-West cold war came to an end as a direct result of the increased \r\ninterpendence of nations, the interrelationship between the political. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n4-5 \r\n(President Ochirbat) \r\neconomic and humanitarian spheres, the bankruptcy of confrontational policies \r\nand the arms race, the changes in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe \r\nand the emergence of new thinking. Thus the 1980s and 1990s mark, in my view, \r\nthe beginning of a transitional period shaping a new world order. At this \r\nvery juncture, with the disintegration of the bipolar world and the creation \r\nof a multipolar one, we are called upon to determine the principles that will \r\ngovern our lives and our forms of cooperation in the next century. \r\nIt is vitally important to establish a new and just world order and to \r\nstrengthen the ethical and legal bases for guaranteeing the fundamental \r\nprinciples of inter-State relations. \r\nMongolia believes that the United Nations should be the focal point of \r\nthe develoment and coordination of these processes. We therefore fully share \r\nand support the conclusions reached to that effect at the recent Stockholm \r\nConference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. In this context, the year 1992 \r\ncould be described as a year that has strengthened these positive trends. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n6 \r\n(President Ochirbat) \r\nThe first ever summit meeting of the Unted Nations Security Council was \r\nheld this year, demonstrating the growing prestige and increasing role of the \r\nUnited Nations. Mongolia fully supports the ideas and many specific proposals \r\nconcerning preventive diplomacy and ways and means of building confidence, \r\ncontained in the report of the Secretary General \"An Agenda for Peace\" \r\nprepared as a follow-up to the aforementioned Security Council summit \r\nmeeting. The report outlines some concrete proposals on the prevention of \r\ndisputes and conflicts, on increasing the role of the United Nations in \r\npeacemaking, peace-keeping and post-conflict peace-building, as well as on the \r\nmechanism of ensuring the security of medium-sized and small States by \r\npolitical means. The importance of these proposals was most vividly \r\ndemonstrated by the Persian Gulf crisis and its lessons. Today the strong \r\ncannot defy with impunity the will of the weak. Mongolia is of the view that \r\nthe main lesson of this conflict is that the world community proved its \r\ndetermination no longer to tolerate actions in violation of the provisions of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. \r\nPluralism and democracy, advancing in every part of the world, penetrate \r\nthe very fabric of international relations and open up broad prospects for \r\ndialogue and cooperation. Progress has been made towards settling some \r\nregional conflicts peacefully and freeing the world from weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. \r\nIn this connection, I would like to note with appreciation such important \r\nevents as the finalization, through consensus, of the draft Convention on the \r\nProhibition and Elimination of Chemical Weapons; the agreement between the \r\nPresidents of the United States and the Russian Federation on the reduction of \r\nthe two countries\u0027 strategic nuclear weapons by the year 2003, far over and \r\nbeyond the limits stipulated in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START); \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n7 \r\n(President Ochirbat) \r\nand the accession of the People\u0027s Republic of China and of France to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We also commend the \r\nnear-nuclear countries for commencing efforts to contribute to disarmament. \r\nWe would hope to see all other States in possession of nuclear weapons join \r\nthe nuclear disarmament talks. \r\nIn a nutshell, although it is too early today to give an exhaustive \r\ndefinition of the new world order, some of its principal features are already \r\nat the stage of maturing. \r\nHowever, these changes, which have brought about prospects of a new era \r\nin international relations, fail to prevent new outbreaks of tension that \r\njeopardize world peace and security. The new hotbeds of conflicts are being \r\ncaused by inequality, ethnic and religious strife and other complex issues of \r\nlong standing. As an example of this, I would refer to the crisis in the \r\nformer Yugoslavia, which is deeply troubling the world community these days. \r\nMongolia deeply regrets the bloodshed taking place between the nations that \r\nused to share one home, and supports the efforts undertaken by the United \r\nNations, as well as such a regional organization as the European Community, in \r\norder to resolve the crisis. We hope that the decisions reached at the London \r\nConference will yield positive results. \r\nMongolia holds the view that it is possible to solve the Yugoslav crisis \r\npeacefully in the manner in which the Cambodian issue is now being settled. \r\nIn this connection, we would like to compliment the permanent members of the \r\nUnited Nations Security Council, the Secretary-General and influential \r\ncountries of the region that are taking an active part in the settlement of \r\nthe Cambodian problem. \r\nA special feature of today\u0027s international relations is the need \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n8 \r\n(President Ochirbat) \r\nappropriately to combine the national interests of a country with those of the \r\nworld community. From this point of view, the United Nations activities \r\ndepend on the situation in and the policies of its Member States. Therefore, \r\nallow me briefly to describe the state of affairs in Mongolia, one of the \r\nMembers of the United Nations, its foreign policy and security interests. \r\nThe history book of Mongols consists of diverse and unique chapters: the \r\nrise and fall of the Great Empire; over 200 years under colonial rule; 70 \r\nyears of Communist experiment. Today, at the turn of the century, we, the \r\nMongols, have embarked on the road to join the mainstream of civilization. \r\nOver the two-odd years since Mongolia has irrevocably embraced democratic \r\nreforms, it has managed basically to dismantle the old social system. We \r\nsupport pluralism through the policies and practical activities of the State. \r\nAs a result, many political parties have emerged and the conditions for \r\ndemocracy\u0027s steady march onward are being created. \r\nOur State structure, which was formed following the first free elections \r\nof 1990, laid down the foundations for democratic movement, took the initial \r\nsteps towards a market economy and promulgated the new Constitution legally \r\nguaranteeing the continuity of democratic reforms. Last June the second \r\nelections were held, resulting in the formation of new State and government \r\ninstitutions and in the formulation of the next stage of the transitional \r\nperiod. This has become yet another guarantee of the irreversibility of our \r\nmovement towards democracy and a market economy. \r\nHowever, a general assessment of this past period speaks of a multitude \r\nof problems, both objective and subjective in nature, in resolving political/ \r\nsocial and economic issues of the current period. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n9-10 \r\n(President Ochirbat) \r\nThe country lacks financial resources. And, as a result, such serious \r\nproblems as the inadequate supply of food and consumer goods to the \r\npopulation, and raw materials, equipment and spare parts for industry, beset \r\nus. The country suffers from acute shortages of housing, medicine and other \r\nvital needs. \r\nThe underdeveloped economic infrastructure and the lopsided pattern of \r\nforeign economic relations aggravate our problems. All this leads to the \r\nslump in production, to inflation and a decline in living standards. \r\nLike other developing countries, we are not in a position to cope with \r\nthese vicissitudes on our own. Donor countries and international \r\norganizations have shown appreciation of our commitment to democratic reforms \r\nand the enormity of our problems by rendering support and assistance essential \r\nto us. I take this opportunity to express, on behalf of the Mongolian people, \r\nour sincere gratitude to the Governments and people of the United States, \r\nJapan, the Republic of Korea, the Federal Republic of Germany, the \r\nNetherlands, Denmark, the People\u0027s Republic of China, the Russian Federation \r\nand others, as well as to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the \r\nAsian Development Bank and the United Nations Development Programme for their \r\nkind cooperation. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n11 \r\n(President Ochirbat) \r\nMongol!?,, in its relations with other countries, has always upheld such \r\nuniversal principles of international relations as mutual respect for \r\nindependence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in each \r\nother\u0027s internal affairs, and will continue to do so in the future. \r\nOur foreign policy has undergone a radical change over the past two years \r\nsince we committed ourselves to the development of democracy and market \r\nrelations, to guaranteeing human rights and fundamental freedoms. Our foreign \r\npolicy has been freed from the ideological bias that had prevailed for decades. \r\nFor Mongolia, which is situated between two of the permanent members of \r\nthe United Nations Security Council, relations with its immediate neighbours \r\nhave always been and will remain a fundamental factor in its foreign policy. \r\nMongolia stands for the development of balanced relations with those two \r\ncountries. We are currently reshaping our relations with them to meet the \r\nrequirements of genuine equality and mutual benefit and the new realities of \r\ninternational politics. The withdrawal of Russian troops, in line with the \r\nagreement reached by the two Governments in the wake of the improving climate \r\nfor regional understanding and cooperation, is being completed. This is in \r\nfull accordance with our new concept of national security. \r\nIn order to contribute to disarmament and trust in the region and \r\nworld-wide, Mongolia declares its territory a nuclear-weapon-free zone. We \r\nshall work towards having this status internationally guaranteed. \r\nWith the disintegration of the former Soviet Union into new independent \r\nStates and the incorporation of these into the international community. \r\nCentral Asia is once again emerging as a separate geopolitical entity. We \r\nbelieve that this vast land area, strategically located as a bridge between \r\nEurope and Asia, should be reflected in the regional representational \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n12 \r\n(President Ochirbat) \r\nstructure of the United Nations and the land-locked position of its countries \r\nduly taken into account. \r\nI should like to take this opportunity to emphasize that we are against \r\nturning Central Asia into a nuclear testing ground. The Mongolian Government \r\nhas repeatedly emphasized the possibility of developing a dialogue on a \r\nregular basis among the States of North-East Asia, an area that is home to \r\nmore than one-third of the world\u0027s population and has a host of military and \r\npolitical, trade and economic, ecological and other pressing problems to deal \r\nwith. The current climate in this subregion offers a favourable opportunity \r\nto realize such ideas and initiatives. At this point, I should like to note \r\nwith appreciation the recent establishment of diplomatic relations between the \r\nPeople\u0027s Republic of China and the Republic of Korea. \r\nOther important features of our time are the increasing political and \r\neconomic interdependence of nations and the intensification of regional \r\nintegration processes. It should be noted that in the Asia-Pacific region, in \r\nspite of the ethnic, religious and cultural diversity as well as the disparity \r\nin the levels of economic and social development, such institutions as the \r\nPacific Economic Cooperation Conference (PECC) and Asia-Pacific Economic \r\nCooperation (APEC) have come into being to facilitate the processes mentioned \r\nearlier. \r\nWe believe that these forums could be broadened in terms of their \r\nmembership with a view to securing the widest possible representation. \r\nMongolia\u0027s intention is to develop trade and economic relations with the \r\ncountries of the region on the basis of mutual benefit and to \r\nparticipate actively in the international division of labour that is taking \r\nshape here. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n13 \r\n(President Ochirbat) \r\nLast year, Mongolia joined the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries as a \r\nfull-fledged member. We understand this Movement to be, inter alia, an \r\nimportant political factor in the protection of the independence and security \r\nof small States. \r\nThe contribution of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, embracing \r\nalmost two thirds of the United Nations membership, is highly important in \r\nenabling the United Nations to effectively address the tasks that face it. \r\nThe recent 10th Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned \r\nCountries, held in Jakarta, has reiterated its readiness to cooperate with the \r\nUnited Nations in building a new world order based on law, equality and \r\njustice. We are of the view that this Summit has been crucial in responding \r\nto certain assertions and allaying certain doubts concerning the Movement\u0027s \r\nalleged loss of relevance and viability in evolving its principles and \r\nobjectives in line with the new realities and in mapping out the Movement\u0027s \r\nstrategies. In our view, it has also given an impetus to the expansion of \r\nSouth-South cooperation. \r\nWith the cold-war era at an end, a propitious opportunity is now at hand \r\nfor the United Nations to work unhindered towards the attainment of its \r\nobjectives. The activities of the United Nations during the past two years \r\nprovide a convincing example. \r\nAlthough the political climate on our planet is rapidly changing for the \r\nbetter, the same cannot be said, unfortunately, of international economic \r\nrelations. We are concerned about the lack of noticeable progress in tackling \r\nthe pressing issues of the world economy, especially those related to the \r\ndevelopment of developing countries and their indebtedness. Mongolia, \r\ntherefore, believes that enhancing the United Nations role in developmental \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n14-15 \r\n(President Ochirbat) \r\nefforts should constitute a major component in the restructuring of the \r\nOrganization. \r\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in Rio \r\nde Janeiro, eloquently testifies to the inextricable link between environment \r\nand sustainable development. What is now required is to launch multilateral \r\nconcerted action to implement the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21. \r\nAt that United Nations Conference my country proposed the establishment \r\nof an international network of ecological pattern countries and the inclusion \r\nof the territory of Mongolia in it as a special zone under international \r\nprotection. In doing so, we proceeded from our understanding that the \r\npreservation of Mongolia\u0027s largely unspoiled natural environment is part and \r\nparcel of global, and particularly Central Asian, ecological concerns. Our \r\ncountry is open to international cooperation in the implementation of \r\nresearch, protection and restoration programmes. We hope that the Member \r\nStates of the United Nations will support our proposal and promote its \r\nrealization. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n16 \r\n(President Ochirbat) \r\nI should like to point out the imperative need to develop and strengthen \r\nthe legal basis of inter-State relations, accelerate the codification of \r\ninternational law and increase the competence of the International Court of \r\nJustice, for the sake of asserting a new international order the world over. \r\nIn conclusion, I should like to express my confidence that this session \r\nthe United Nations General Assembly will successfully complete its \r\ndeliberations. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe President of Mongolia for the important statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Punsalmaaoiin Ochirbat. President of Mongolia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued) \r\nGENERAL DEBATE \r\nMr. SOLANA MADARIAGA (Spain) (interpretation from Spanish): Allow \r\nme first of all to convey to you. Sir, my most sincere congratulations, on my \r\nown behalf and that of my delegation, on your election to the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. I wish you every success \r\nin the execution of your tasks during the coming months. I also wish to pay a \r\ntribute to your predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia. \r\nI should like to give a warm welcome to all those countries that have \r\njoined the Organization this year, and I hope that their active participation \r\nin this forum will contribute to the efforts of the international community to \r\npreserve peace and promote justice and progress among nations. With the \r\nadmissions of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, \r\nKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, San Marino, Slovenia, \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n17 \r\n(Mr. Solana Madariaga. Spain) \r\nTajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, the Organization\u0027s goal of \r\nuniversality has been promoted. \r\nI should also like to convey to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali \r\nthe respect of the Spanish Government for his efforts and dedication in \r\ncarrying out the important responsibilities with which he is entrusted. You \r\nmay rest assured, Mr. Secretary-General, that you can count on the full \r\ncollaboration of the Spanish authorities. \r\nDuring the general debate at the forty-sixth session, the common \r\ndenominator of many statements heard in the General Assembly was the \r\ntremendous changes that had taken place in the world since the middle of the \r\nprevious decade. Far from abating, the pace of that trend to transformation \r\nhas significantly accelerate over the last 12 months. \r\nAt this stage of the process, it would be no exaggeration to say that we \r\nhave before us a new pattern of international relations. After the \r\ndisappearance of the East-West confrontation and its replacement by dialogue \r\nand cooperation, decisive progress has been made in disarmament agreements and \r\narms control, at both world-wide and regional levels. Long-festering regional \r\nconflicts have been settled or may well be on their way towards settlement. \r\nTo the progress made along the road to peace in Angola and Cambodia we must \r\nadd the process begun last year in Madrid with the opening of the Middle East \r\npeace conference, which constituted an invaluable point of departure for the \r\nsolution of the Palestinian problem and for achieving the necessary and \r\ndefinitive harmonious relations between Arabs and Israelis. \r\nLikewise, the current peace plan for Western Sahara should culminate soon \r\nin the holding of a referendum on self-determination under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n18 \r\n(Mr. Solana Madariaga. Spain) \r\nI also wish to stress the progress made in the eradication of the policy \r\nof apartheid in South Africa. We fully support the efforts of the \r\nSecretary-General to put an end to violence and to encourage the resumption of \r\nthe internal negotiations that must lead to the total eradication of apartheid \r\nand to the establishment of a truly democratic regime in South Africa. \r\nSimilarly, the Peace Agreement signed in Chapultepec, on 16 January of \r\nthis year, between the Government of El Salvador and the Farabundo Marti \r\nNational Liberation Front constitutes a milestone of paramount importance for \r\nthe peace process in Central America, a region that has been in a constant \r\nstate of conflict for the past decade. Spain, which has so many links to that \r\nregion, has been and is still actively collaborating in that process through \r\nits participation in the Group of Friends of the Secretary-General for peace \r\nin El Salvador.. \r\nIn that connection, Spain welcomes the exemplary manner in which the \r\nGovernments of El Salvador and Honduras have settled their territorial, \r\ninsular and maritime disputes. \r\nThe map of Europe has undergone a profound transformation over the past \r\nyear. The unification of Germany now appears fully consolidated. Russia and \r\nthe formerly subjugated countries that recovered their independence and \r\nfreedom are struggling to consolidate their democracies and to overcome the \r\nserious economic difficulties brought on by their transition to a market \r\neconomy. The European Community, on its way towards union, is acquiring a \r\ngreater political role, in accordance with its undoubted economic strength. \r\nDemocratic ideals and practices and the recognition of human rights have \r\nreappeared vigorously not only in Eastern Europe but also in Latin America and \r\nA/47/PV. 13 \r\n19-20 \r\n(Mr. Solana Madariaga. Spain) \r\nmany African countries, despite the grave economic situation now prevailing on \r\nthat continent. \r\nThose auspicious events should not lead us to forget that the collapse of \r\nthe former system has opened up a great void fraught with risks in which \r\ndisorder may find a natural home. In some extreme cases, we are witnessing \r\nthe exacerbation of previously repressed or latent nationalist forces which \r\nare giving rise to such bloody conflicts as those at present dividing the new \r\nCaucasian Republics and the new States that emerged after the dissolution of \r\nthe former Yugoslavia. Such situations reveal that the horrors of the past \r\ncan always be repeated if we do not keep looking to the future. This is \r\nsomething that neither Europe nor the rest of the international community can \r\nor should allow. \r\nThe seriousness of the conflict now taking place in the territory of the \r\nformer Yugoslavia is a good example of what I have just said. In the \r\nConference that started in London, the many efforts of the international \r\ncommunity converged in an attempt to put an end to that complex conflict by \r\nhelping the parties to resolve their differences through the negotiations \r\ncurrently taking place in Geneva. Aggression, the use of force, and the \r\nviolation of human rights will only generate destruction and hatred and will \r\nmeet with the continued condemnation and determined action of the \r\ninternational community to put an end to them. \r\nA/47 /PV. 13 \r\n21 \r\n(Mr. Solana Madariaga. Spain) \r\nMeanwhile, the gap between the developed and the developing countries \r\npersists and, in many cases, has even widened. Old conflicts have intensified \r\nand new ones have appeared. The tragedy presently afflicting Somalia is \r\npalpable proof of the terrible effects that underdevelopment, poverty, natural \r\ndisasters and violence can have when they coincide in time and place. This \r\nsituation demands greater solidarity and a swift collective response such as \r\nthe one decided in the framework of the United Nations, which was aimed at \r\nputting an end to such terrible suffering and making possible a peace process \r\nthat will lead to national reconciliation in that country. \r\nFor all these reasons, after the initial moments of surprise and \r\neuphoria, of perplexity and optimism in the face of what seemed to be the \r\nemergence of a new world order, we are now coping with the need to incorporate \r\nthese new changes, so as jointly to build a more just and secure international \r\nsociety. \r\nThis is the great task confronting the United Nations today. The choice \r\nis very clear: we cannot allow the Organization to trail behind events, \r\nletting itself be moulded by them. On the other hand, we can make the United \r\nNations an active forum and the foremost centre in the transformations \r\naffecting us all, capable of influencing and shaping these transformations. \r\nThis alternative, this leading role, which is the one desired by Spain for the \r\nUnited Nations, is the choice that seems to have been made by the \r\nSecretary-General when he drew up his excellent report entitled \"An Agenda for \r\nPeace\" (A/47/277),\u0027 and when he reported to the General Assembly on the work of \r\nthe Organization. \r\nI referred earlier to changes in the international climate that have made \r\nit possible to defuse various deeply-rooted regional conflicts. The United \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n22 \r\n(Mr. Solana Madariaga. Spain) \r\nNations has contributed to this objective to a large extent through the \r\npeacemaking activities of the Secretary-General carried out in the framework \r\nof the peace-keeping operations. The results obtained over recent years have \r\nmade it possible to speak, truly, of a process of revitalization of the \r\nOrganization. \r\nHowever, the present momentum behind this process has proven \r\ninsufficient, as demonstrated by the persistence of some old conflicts and the \r\noutburst of new forms of violence. From this perspective, the Spanish \r\nGovernment believes that the set of suggestions put forward by Mr. \r\nBoutros-Ghali represents a very useful basis for a systematic and effective \r\nresponse by the Organization and the international community to any kind of \r\nconflict, whatever the causes and outcome. It is essential, to this end, to \r\nsecure the cooperation of all Member States in the complex tasks ranging from \r\nconflict-prevention to the consolidatiou of peace. \r\nThe increase and enhancement of peace-keeping operations requires a \r\ngrowing effort on the part of us all. Spain is aware of this and, after \r\nparticipating in a noteworthy manner in the United Nations Transition \r\nAssistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia and in the United Nations Observer Group \r\nin Central America (ONUCA), is contributing with a large number of army and \r\npolice officers to the work of the United Nations Operation in El Salvador \r\n(ONUSAL). Moreover, Spain is participating actively in the United Nations \r\nAngola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II) and is collaborating with the United \r\nNations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). Spain is also \r\nprepared to participate with a military contingent in the task of the United \r\nNations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Finally, Spain \r\nprovides aid - mainly humanitarian within the framework of other operations \r\nestablished by the Security Council. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n23 \r\n(Mr. Solana Madariaga. Spain) \r\nThe peace-keeping operations have also undergone a qualitative change, as \r\nnew and different activities have been undertaken that go beyond their \r\ntraditional limits. These new dimensions require special training and a rapid \r\nresponse that can hardly be obtained if we do not follow the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s suggestion of establishing special national units ready to \r\nbe rapidly deployed at the service of the Organization. Spain is prepared to \r\nconsider this proposal seriously after appropriate consultations with the \r\nother Member States and with the Secretary-General. \r\nNevertheless, we must bear in mind that peace cannot be made and cannot \r\nbe consolidated with the use of military means alone. It is necessary, \r\nwhenever possible, to resolve conflicts before they degenerate into armed \r\nhostilities, using all the means for peaceful settlement of disputes provided \r\nfor in the Charter. In this context, I would like to underline the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s statement that greater confidence on the part of States in \r\nthe International Court of Justice would contribute significantly to the \r\nOrganization\u0027s task of peace-seeking. Spain has already given proof of this \r\nconfidence by recently accepting the Court\u0027s compulsory jurisdiction and by \r\nsupporting the possibility of authorizing the Secretary-General to request \r\nadvisory opinions of the Court on legal questions arising within the scope of \r\nhis activities. \r\nSpain has firmly supported the strengthening of the United Nations role \r\nin the field of preventive diplomacy. That is why we decided to co-sponsor \r\nthe initiatives leading to the approval, in 1988, of the Declaration on \r\nconflict-prevention and, in 1991, of the Declaration on Fact-finding by the \r\nUnited Nations in the Field of the Maintenance of International Peace and \r\nSecurity. These efforts should be enhanced, and in this connection, such \r\nmeasures as fact-finding missions, an early-warning system and the \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n24-25 \r\n(Mr. Solana Madariaga. Spain) \r\nreinforcement of the role of regional organizations can be very useful in \r\npreventing conflicts which, if allowed to start, might later require the \r\nlaunching of a much more costly exercise for the re-establishement of peace. \r\nIn this sense, we also believe that all efforts that could contribute to \r\nthe consolidation of peace once it has been reached, should be promoted in \r\norder to avoid the resurgence of new conflicts over the not yet extinguished \r\nflames of a pre-existent conflict. In this regard, I would like to underline \r\nhere the considerable increase in the Organization\u0027s efforts in the field of \r\nhumanitarian assistance, as well as the tasks recently carried out in the \r\nfield of electoral assistance in countries where democracy and peaceful \r\ncohabitation are threatened or insufficiently established. The role of the \r\nOrganization on behalf of refugees has also been of great importance for the \r\nconsolidation of peace, as has its work in the field of disarmament and the \r\npromotion and defence of human rights. \r\nThe Member States of the Organization must be aware that the new tasks \r\nthat we are entrusting to the United Nations are increasing in number and \r\ncomplexity day by day, and are without precedent in its history. In order for \r\nthe Organization to be prepared to meet these new demands for international \r\naction, the unconditional financial backing of each of its Members is required. \r\nThis year, we have completed the drafting of the text of the Convention \r\non chemical weapons, which envisages the prohibition of the development, \r\nstockpiling and use of these weapons, as well as their destruction. The \r\nelimination of this type of weapon is a long-sought objective that should now \r\nbe attained. Spain decidedly supports the adoption of this Convention at this \r\nsession of the General Assembly, and hopes that it will soon enter into force. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n26 \r\n(Mr. Solana Madariaga. Spain) \r\nWe welcome the proposal of the Twelve, adopted by the General Assembly \r\nlast year, to create in the Secretariat a Register of Conventional Arms with \r\nregard to the international transfer of such arms, which envisages the \r\ntransmission of information by all Member States. It is necessary for all of \r\nus to cooperate, so that this Register may be established as the \r\nclearing-house for the exchange of information on all flows of conventional \r\narms, and in the near future to include information on other types of weapons \r\nand other data concerning the military capacity of States. \r\nTo the achievements of the Organization in the field of disarmament and \r\narms control must be added this year other important progress made at regional \r\nand world-wide levels aimed at reinforcing the stability and security of our \r\nplanet and thus the purposes of the United Nations. \r\nI am referring to the withdrawal of all tactical nuclear weapons, from \r\nareas where they were deployed until very recently, to the territories of the \r\nUnited States and the Russian Federation. We must underscore as well the \r\nagreements reached recently by President Bush and President Yeltsin on a \r\ndrastic reduction of the nuclear arsenals in their respective countries. We \r\nalso welcome the initiatives taken by several nuclear Powers to declare \r\nmoratoriums on their nuclear tests, or to reduce them to a bare minimum. \r\nIn the European region, one must underscore the significance of the \r\nTreaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and its complementary Act on \r\npersonnel strength, both already in force, as well as the conclusion of the \r\nOpen Skies Treaty and the adoption of a new series of confidence-building \r\nmeasures. \r\nA/47/PV. 13 \r\n27 \r\n(Mr. Solana Madariaga. Spain) \r\nSpain welcomes all these achievements and hopes that they will lead to \r\nfurther progress in this field. \r\nThe ultimate beneficiary of the United Nations efforts to achieve a more \r\npeaceful, just and secure world is undoubtedly mankind as a whole. \r\nThanks to a large extent to United Nations action we have made \r\nsignificant advances in the defence and protection of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms internationally. However, we are living in a period of \r\ninstability and uncertainty, in which not only economic inequalities but also \r\nthe resurgence of intolerance, xenophobia and exacerbated nationalism, among \r\nother factors, are endangering personal freedom and security. That is why it \r\nis necessary to intensify our efforts in this area, so as to encourage \r\nunderstanding and respect for the rights of individual members of minorities \r\nand for the needs of the most vulnerable groups of society. In this respect, \r\nwe consider particularly important that this Assembly approve by consensus, as \r\nthe Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council have \r\nrecently done, the draft declaration on the rights of persons belonging to \r\nnational, ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities. \r\nMy country places great hopes on the World Conference on Human Rights \r\nscheduled for next year in Vienna. This Conference should, on the basis of \r\nexisting universally accepted standards, draw the basic guidelines for our \r\nfuture activity in this field, so that individuals and peoples may, through \r\ndemocracy and development, fully enjoy the benefits of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms. \r\nThe achievements of the United Nations in the field of international \r\npeace and security contrast with the limited progress in the sphere of \r\neconomic and social development. The world gap between rich and poor has been \r\nwidening in an alarming way. The United Nations Development Programme\u0027s Human \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n28 \r\n(Mr. Solana Madariaga. Spain) \r\nDevelopment Report for 1992 shows that the richest 20 per cent of the world \r\npopulation receive 82.7 per cent of total world income, whereas the poorest \r\n20 per cent receive only 1.4 per cent. \r\nThe international community cannot remain passive in the face of these \r\ngrave and growing disparities. The Organization, owing to its universal \r\nmembership and the breadth of its purposes and principles, must play a leading \r\nrole to guide and stimulate the establishment of guidelines for the United \r\nNations system as a whole, in order to find solutions to the important issues \r\nrelated to the development and well-being of all peoples. \r\nIt is necessary in this respect to strengthen the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. Some progress has already been made in its restructuring, but it is \r\nnecessary that such restructuring be continued and deepened in order to \r\nrevitalize this principal organ of our Organization. It also seems necessary \r\nto envisage the reform of the United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) in order to adapt it to the new realities, as was \r\nunderscored at its eighth session, held in Cartagena de Indias last February. \r\nWe support the establishment by the Assembly during its current session \r\nof a high-level Commission on Sustainable Development that was agreed to at \r\nthe Conference on Environment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro last \r\nJune, where the concept of sustainable development was identified as a central \r\nelement that should inspire the theory and practice of development policies in \r\nthe coming years. \r\nWe should look for new ways of dealing with the main task of attaining \r\nsustainable development and assign greater financial resources to this task, \r\nin particular by those countries that are in a position to do so. My country \r\nis aware of the fact that it must make an effort in proportion to its economic \r\ncapacity. For this reason, the President of the Spanish Government at the \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n29-30 \r\n(Mr. Solans Madariaga. Spain) \r\nsummit meeting at Rio de Janeiro, after recalling that Spain had tripled its \r\nofficial aid over the past 10 years, made a commitment to triple its aid again \r\nin the course of the coming decade. This is a difficult challenge that we \r\nhave taken upon ourselves but one that we are ready to fulfil. \r\nThe world population has more than doubled over the past 40 years, and \r\naccording to recent estimates it will double again in the next 30 years. This \r\nastounding growth demands a serious analysis on the part of the international \r\ncommunity as well as a careful study of the consequences that it generates, \r\nsuch as migratory flows, the problems of large urban concentrations and the \r\nenormous demands it creates in the areas of food, housing, health care and \r\neducation. These are all issues that should be studied in depth at the \r\nConference on Population and Development, to be held in Cairo in 1994. \r\nIt is not surprising that social problems are gaining importance at the \r\npresent time, when many economies are undergoing tough processes of adjustment \r\nand others are going through difficult transitions from a central planning \r\nsystem to one of market economy. The summit conference on social development \r\nto be held in 1995 is therefore a timely initiative. Proper preparation is \r\nthe best guarantee for its success. The basic guiding principle for its work \r\nshould be the concept of human development; it should examine the necessary \r\nmeasures to provide greater opportunities for education, medical care and \r\nemployment to the world\u0027s inhabitants. It is becoming daily more obvious that \r\neconomic growth in itself does not automatically improve people\u0027s living \r\nconditions, neither within nations nor internationally. Therefore, it is \r\nessential to give a social dimension to the concept of economic development. \r\nAllow me to refer now to two great threats to society today: drug \r\ntrafficking and terrorism. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n31 \r\n(Mr. Solana Madariaga. Spain) \r\nThe drug-trafficking business is so grim and complex and has so many \r\nramifications that efforts to combat it must be based on the strengthening of \r\nnational measures and on effective international coordination and cooperation. \r\nThe producer countries must receive the assistance needed to grow \r\nalternative crops and to enable them to confront the powerful and well-armed \r\ndrug-trafficking organizations. Those countries producing substances likely \r\nto be used in the manufacture of drugs should inspect and control the exports \r\nof those substances. Consuming countries also responsible for the \r\ndrug-trafficking must strengthen programmes and measures aimed at decreasing \r\ndomestic demand. Moreover, perseverance is necessary in inspecting bank \r\naccounts used by drug traffickers and in reporting money-laundering when \r\nsuspicions of its connection with this illegal activity exist. Concealing \r\ninformation on the drug-trafficking business amounts to complicity in criminal \r\nactivity. \r\nTerrorism, for its part, continues to pose a threat to human life and to \r\ncoexistence between nations. It is a threat of an international character and \r\nas such requires international efforts for its eradication. General Assembly \r\nresolution 46/51, adopted by consensus last year, was a further step in United \r\nNations work aimed at developing greater international cooperation for this \r\npurpose. \r\nThose two threats, especially that of terrorism, are interrelated with \r\nillegal arms dealing, which must be combated just as firmly by the \r\ninternational community. \r\nThere is one issue whose importance for Spain is well known: the \r\ndecolonization of Gibraltar. I wish to restate my Government\u0027s determination \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n32 \r\n(Mr. Solana Madariaga. Spain) \r\nto continue, with dedication and in a constructive spirit, the negotiating \r\nprocess with the United Kingdom established by the Brussels Declaration of \r\n27 November 1984, bearing in mind the doctrine of the General Assembly that \r\nthis is not a case of self-determination but a situation that affects the \r\nterritorial integrity of Spain. I trust that the negotiating efforts of both \r\nGovernments will soon lead to a definitive solution that, while taking into \r\naccount the legitimate interests of the people, will put an end to the \r\ncolonial status of Gibraltar a status that is clearly anachronistic and \r\ninappropriate to the times in which we live, especially since the General \r\nAssembly\u0027s proclamation of the International Decade for the Eradication of \r\nColonialism until the year 2000. \r\nLast July, in Madrid, the Heads of State and Government participating in \r\nthe Second Ibero-American Summit adopted a document of conclusions reaffirming \r\ntheir aspirations to a free, open and pluralistic society directed towards \r\nprogress and social justice, a society in which free rein is given to the full \r\nexercise of individual freedoms and in which no one is excluded or \r\npersecuted. I am certain that this is an ideal we all share. \r\nThe Ibero-American Summit declared itself in favour of reforming the \r\nUnited Nations system and stressed the need to give it momentum so that it \r\ncould respond more efficiently to the will of all its Member States. The \r\ncelebration, in 1995, of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations will \r\nbe a good occasion for the attainment of this objective, which will enable the \r\nGeneral Assembly to undergo renewal and revitalization, following on that \r\nalready experienced by the Security Council. The Organization would then more \r\nfaithfully reflect the important changes that have taken place in \r\ninternational society during the last 50 years. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n33 \r\n(Mr. Solana Madariaga. Spain) \r\nWe are all well aware that in today\u0027s world no nation can stand on its \r\nown. The fate of each and every one of our countries is linked to the fate of \r\nthe others. I wish therefore to conclude my statement by expressing the firm \r\nconviction that in the new global and integrated society that is emerging at \r\nthe end of this century no intelligent action can be taken that is not based \r\non the exercise of the most resolute solidarity. \r\nMr. FALEIRO (India): May I, at the outset, congratulate you. Sir, \r\non your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. \r\nI should also like to express our appreciation for the stewardship of the \r\nforty-sixth session of the General Assembly by your predecessor. \r\nAmbassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia. \r\nThis is the first session of the General Assembly since \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali assumed the office of Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations, and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to his dynamism, \r\ndiplomatic skills and zeal for reform. \r\nI should also like to welcome into our midst the new Members of the \r\nUnited Nations and wish them success in their multifarious efforts and tasks. \r\nThere have been dramatic changes world wide since the Assembly last met, \r\nin 1991. Some of these changes augur well, while others present uncertain \r\nprospects. While the cold war and the East-West confrontation are now, \r\nhappily, but aberrations of the past, the shadow of conflict and suffering \r\nlooms large in Yugoslavia, in Somalia and, indeed, in many other parts of the \r\nworld. \r\nWe cannot, therefore, be complacent or euphoric. What should have made \r\nthe world safer has at the same time unleashed tendencies ethnic, sectarian \r\nand other - that threaten to keep it unsafe. The efforts of developing \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n34-35 \r\n(Mr. Faleiro. India) \r\ncountries to improve their socio-economic conditions remain hamstrung by the \r\ninequities of the present international economic order. \r\nTherefore, what we need to work for is a new international order free \r\nfrom war, poverty, illiteracy and injustice. In this great endeavour the \r\nUnited Nations has a central role to play. Some eight and a half months ago, \r\nin this very city of New York, at the summit of the Security Council, \r\nPrime Minister Narasimha Rao pointed out that \r\n\"Lasting peace and security necessarily require comparable levels of \r\nhuman happiness across the globe. It is impossible to think of a United \r\nNations functioning usefully or harmoniously while humankind continues to \r\nbe riddled with ever-increasing disparities\". (S/PV.3046. p. 96) \r\nThat is the concern that animates and reinforces our commitment to a United \r\nNations dedicated as much to peace and stability as to progress and prosperity. \r\nThe international community\u0027s efforts in this direction are none the less \r\nhaunted by the shadow of continuing violence and conflict around the world. \r\nIndia has been deeply concerned at the conflict in Yugoslavia. The tragedy of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina demands redress. Its people must be given the chance \r\nto lead their lives in peace. India believes that the good work the United \r\nNations is doing in that region deserves all our support. We also trust that \r\ndecisions taken here will not complicate either the search for peace or the \r\nfunctioning of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in a difficult \r\nand dangerous situation. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n36 \r\n(Mr. Faleiro. India) \r\nSomalia\u0027s tragedy is equally heart-rending. The wretchedness of its \r\npeople, caught in a seemingly endless cycle of violence and misery, cries out \r\nfor redress. The United Nations has instituted a valiant and generous \r\noperation there to provide relief to those affected. India believes that all \r\nthe Somalian parties should work together to bring the conflict to an end so \r\nthat tranquillity can be restored and the people of Somalia can be given the \r\nchance to work out their own destinies in peace. \r\nAfter years of suffering, the people of Cambodia aspire to build a \r\nsovereign, independent, non-aligned nation for themselves. The United Nations \r\ncannot falter in Cambodia, and the parties concerned in that country have a \r\nresponsibility to ensure the success of the United Nations efforts. \r\nIndia has consistently supported the sovereignty, territorial integrity \r\nand non-aligned status of Afghanistan. We hope that all the parties there \r\nwill work to restore peace and harmony so that the people of Afghanistan can \r\nhave the opportunity, free of violence and conflict, to work for their own \r\nwell-being. \r\nA glimmer of hope is visible on the West Asian horizon, with Israel and \r\nits Arab neighbours settling down to a dialogue. The numerous resolutions \r\nadopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly provide the necessary \r\ngoals for those negotiations. The occupation of Arab lands should be vacated \r\nand the restitution of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, \r\nincluding their right to establish an independent State, as well as the \r\nsecurity of all States in the region, should be assured if a genuine \r\nsettlement with lasting peace is to be achieved in that part of the world. \r\nWhat the United Nations was able to do in restoring to Kuwait its \r\nindependence and sovereignty was a singular achievement. India has \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Faleiro. India) \r\ntraditionally enjoyed the warmest of relations with Kuwait, and we trust that \r\nfollowing the restoration of its sovereignty Kuwait will also be able to \r\nrecover the prosperity that it formerly enjoyed. \r\nI should like to add here that India feels sympathy for the civilian \r\npopulation of Iraq, and we believe that its needs should be looked at with \r\ngenerosity. Iraq\u0027s sovereignty as a State and its territorial integrity \r\nshould be respected. \r\nThe recent unfortunate violence in South Africa and the setback to the \r\nnegotiations there for the elimination of apartheid will, we hope, be \r\ntemporary. It is encouraging that the parties concerned have welcomed the \r\ncatalytic role of the United Nations, which is fully committed to the \r\nobjective of establishing a democratic, non-racial and united South Africa. \r\nAs the country that first brought the question of apartheid to the United \r\nNations in 1946, India is hopeful that the presence of United Nations \r\nobservers will help to end the violence there and to get the negotiating \r\nprocess going once again. \r\nIndia has noted the recent changes in Fiji. I hope that the Government \r\nof Fiji will eschew racial and ethnic discrimination and revert to democratic \r\ngovernance at an early date. \r\nThe Secretary-General has been able to record some progress on the issue \r\nof Cyprus. The acceptance by the parties concerned of the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\n\"set of ideas\" is significant. We share the Secretary-General\u0027s hope that the \r\nnext round of direct talks in October will be the conclusive one. \r\nAt this session the Assembly will take up the matter of the recently \r\nnegotiated chemical-weapons Convention. The Convention opens up possibilities \r\nfor similar action in other areas of disarmament. In this context, India in \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n38 \r\n(Mr. Faleiro. India) \r\n1988 proposed an action plan for nuclear disarmament within a specified \r\ntime-frame. As an immediate step, the United Nations should envisage the \r\nfollowing: a convention on the non-use of nuclear weapons, a verifiable \r\nfreeze on the production of fissionable material for weapons purposes, a \r\nsuspension of nuclear-weapon tests and negotiations on general and complete \r\ndisarmament. \r\nNon-proliferation is a laudable objective, and India\u0027s commitment to it \r\nhas been affirmed time and again. But there should be no distinction between \r\nnuclear-weapon States and non-nuclear-weapon States when it comes to rights \r\nand obligations. The geographical spread of nuclear arsenals has, as it were, \r\nnuclearized the globe. Therefore, the international community\u0027s efforts \r\nshould be directed against that global menace. As part of them, regional \r\nnon-proliferation should be considered only within the context of a properly \r\nspecified region, taking into account the security concerns of the countries \r\nof the region, whose prior agreement should be obtained. \r\nHuman rights have gained emphasis in recent times, and deservedly so. \r\nIndia welcomes the changes around the world that have strengthened human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms. In line with our democratic traditions, \r\nindependent judiciary and press and alert public, India has decided to set up \r\na national human-rights commission further to safeguard and promote \r\nfundamental human rights in India. \r\nI should like to point out here that one of the most vicious forms of \r\nhuman-rights violations today is the violence unleashed by terrorists. And \r\nterrorism assumes a particularly pernicious character when it is aided, \r\nabetted and sponsored from abroad. Such sponsorship is against the principles \r\nof the United Nations Charter, and should be vigorously opposed by all. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n39-40 \r\n(Mr. Faleiro. India) \r\nThe United Nations recognizes its responsibilities for providing \r\nhumanitarian assistance to Member States facing grave humanitarian crises. \r\nThe newly created capacity of the United Nations to deal with such situations \r\nhas performed creditably. It is important in this context that we mobilize \r\nthe United Nations to address the root causes of many such disruptions: \r\npoverty, illiteracy and lack of development. It is equally important for the \r\nUnited Nations to be seen to be acting correctly and impartially in this field \r\nand at the request of the country concerned. \r\nThe report of the Secretary-General entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\" \r\n(A/47/277) articulates the wealth of experience that the United Nations has \r\ngained in recent years in peacemaking and peace-keeping, and is an important \r\nand welcome input into our study of how the role of the United Nations in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security can be strengthened. India, \r\ngiven its traditional and long-standing contribution to United Nations \r\npeace-keeping forces, takes a special interest in the matter. I trust that we \r\nshall be able to respond positively and constructively, in keeping with the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, to the Secretary-General\u0027s ideas. It should be \r\nensured that the measures envisaged do not lead to the abridgement of the \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States. They should also respect the \r\ncardinal tenet of non-interference in the internal affairs of States. \r\nJust as international activism should not violate accepted norms of \r\ninternational relations, the principle of self-determination has to be seen in \r\nthe context of respect for national sovereignty. Self-determination can apply \r\nonly to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation, and \r\nnot to integral parts of sovereign nations. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n41 \r\n(Mr. Faleiro. India) \r\nThe implementation of the proposals made by the Secretary-General will \r\nmean a more vigorous Security Council. An enhanced mandate for the Council \r\nrequires matching transparency and democracy in its functioning. This cannot \r\nbe done without an expansion of the membership of the Council to reflect the \r\nincreased membership of the United Nations over the past few years, as well as \r\nthe realities of the many changes in the international situation. And here I \r\nwould submit that along with economic criteria, other relevant criteria should \r\nbe given due weight in this context. \r\nThe expansion in membership that I referred to is all the more essential \r\nif the Council is to ensure its moral sanction and political effectiveness. \r\nAs the Secretary-General points out in his report on the work of the \r\nOrganization \r\n\"Democracy within the family of nations means the application of its \r\nprinciples within the world Organization itself.\" (A/47/1, para. 169) \r\nSimilarly, the General Assembly has to be made more effective so as to \r\nrepresent not only the changes in its membership, but also the significant \r\ncharacter of its universal composition. \r\nAn agenda for development is as important to the United Nations as an \r\nagenda for peace. Any effort to assign to the United Nations only a \r\ncomplementary role in the economic and social field is, in fact, contrary to \r\nthe letter and spirit of the Charter. The United Nations should continue to \r\nhave a central role in macroeconomic policy formulation and implementation, \r\nbecause this is the only forum for reaching an international consensus on \r\ndevelopment. Developing nations around the globe, including India, are \r\nengaged in major reforms of their internal economic policies and mechanisms \r\nwith a view to integrating their economies with the global economy. These \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Faleiro. India) \r\nreforms will have very limited meaning unless the external economic \r\nenvironment becomes conducive to the growth and development of developing \r\ncountries. \r\nThe Secretary-General, in his report on the work of the Organization, \r\nmakes it clear that \r\n\"the Organization\u0027s responsibilities and commitments in the political and \r\nsecurity area should not be carried out at the expense of its \r\nresponsibilities in the development field ...\" (A/47/1, para. 66) \r\nThis underpins and reinforces the continuing commitment of the United Nations \r\nin the field of development, particularly of the developing countries. \r\nThe world economy is integrating both globally and regionally. But in \r\nthe process, the needs of the developing countries are not finding the \r\nattention and response that they deserve. Hence, it becomes imperative that \r\ncertain international events succeed such as the Uruguay Round of \r\nMultilateral Trade Negotiations, whose early, successful and balanced outcome \r\nwould inject growth impulses into the world economy as a whole. The \r\nNorth-South dialogue is languishing and deserves reactivation. There are \r\nvarious other inequities in global economic interaction - such as poor \r\ncommodity prices, monetary imbalances and others that call for urgent \r\nredress. The developing countries look to the United Nations for correctives \r\nin these fields. Socio-economic progress in developing countries will, in \r\nturn - I have no doubt about it enrich the prosperity of the developed world \r\nitself. \r\nHere, may I mention a disquieting aspect in this field, namely the \r\ntendency to impose non-economic conditionalities in international development \r\nassistance. They should be avoided so that the effectiveness of development \r\nassistance may not be impaired. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n43 \r\n(Mr. Faleiro. India) \r\nMy delegation sees merit in a number of proposals in the area of the \r\ndevelopmental activities of the United Nations put forward by various groups, \r\nparticularly the Nordic countries. In our view, one of the principal \r\nobjectives of the exercise should be to decentralize the operational \r\nactivities of the United Nations system so that countries and regions with \r\ntheir special characteristics and levels of development may be able to \r\nimplement programmes suitable to them. Also, adequate resources should be \r\nfound to promote development in the developing countries. \r\nThe process of the restructuring of the United Nations should take into \r\naccount the additional responsibilities assigned to the United Nations by the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) that was held \r\nthis year. The concept of sustainable development has to be translated into \r\nworkable strategies and policy measures. In the pursuit of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, developing countries need resources and, what is more, technical \r\nassistance, as well as environmentally sound technologies on preferential and \r\nconcessional terms. I do hope that the establishment of a Commission on \r\nSustainable Development in the course of the present session will lead to \r\neffective follow-up of UNCED. The creation of a Planet Protection Fund, which \r\nplaces on all countries, except the least developed, an obligation to acquire \r\nand develop environment-friendly technologies, will facilitate universal \r\nparticipation in the collective effort to attain sustainable development. \r\nThe non-aligned countries, meeting at the level of Heads of State or \r\nGovernment in Jakarta earlier this month, issued the Jakarta message, which \r\nstates: \r\n\"A shift in focus of international relations to strengthen multilateral \r\ncooperation based on genuine interdependence, mutuality of interests and \r\nshared responsibility, has become indispensable.\" \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n44 \r\n(Mr. Faleiro. India) \r\nIf we, in the international community and here at the United Nations, are to \r\ncooperate to combat global menaces and inequalities, we will need to forge a \r\nglobal partnership. And here, I am reminded of what the Prime Minister of \r\nIndia stated at the recent summit of non-aligned countries to which I have \r\nreferred: \r\n\"We are happy to note that the United Nations, at last, is coming into \r\nits own in the fifth decade of its existence. While even today there is \r\na tendency to subordinate the global agenda to narrow national concerns, \r\nwe are happy to note that the United Nations is more effective than ever \r\nbefore. The question now is to make it even more effective.\" \r\nLet us also hope that the Assembly as its present session will promote \r\nthe effectiveness of the United Nations even further by shaping it as an \r\ninstrument of international consensus and action and of common benefit in all \r\nmatters of international concern. \r\nMr. CETIN (Turkey): It gives me great pleasure, Sir, to \r\ncongratulate you on your election to the high office of President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We are happy to have a distinguished leader from a \r\nneighbouring country at the helm of the Assembly for the next 12 months. Our \r\nrelations with Bulgaria are excellent, and we are very glad to have supported \r\nyour candidacy. \r\nThe forty-sixth session of the General Assembly was remarkable and \r\neventful in a number of ways. Ambassador Samir Shihabi, the President at the \r\nlast session, deserves a special tribute for his distinctive contribution to \r\nthe efforts to enhance the stature of this universal forum. The competence \r\nand wisdom he displayed in guiding our work have justified the confidence we \r\nplaced in him. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n45 \r\n(Mr. Cetin. Turkey) \r\nWe are fortunate that, in the person of Mr. Boutros-Ghali, the United \r\nNations has found the experience and wisdom to which it can entrust itself for \r\nguidance to success. My Government is confident that this distinguished \r\nstatesman from Africa, who is the product of the ancient and glorious \r\ncivilization of Egypt, will provide the right mix of continuity and change in \r\nthe renewal and restructuring of this world body. We wish our new \r\nSecretary-General success, and pledge him our support. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n46 \r\n(Mr. Cetin. Turkey) \r\nMy delegation welcomes and salutes the 13 new Members of our \r\nOrganization. We take special pride in the fact that Turkey enjoys ties of \r\nkinship, language and culture with some of them. They will surely enrich and \r\nstrengthen our global family. \r\nIn the past few years we have witnessed one of the great turning-points \r\nof history. The cold war has come to an end. The international landscape, \r\ncharacterized for so long by ideological confrontation and nuclear stalemate, \r\nhas undergone a fundamental change. The bitter East-West rivalries that \r\ndominated every aspect of international affairs are finally behind us. These \r\nmomentous developments have made it possible to settle a number of conflicts \r\nwhich were a direct result of the cold war. From Africa to Asia to Latin \r\nAmerica, people have been able to lay aside ideological disputes and get on \r\nwith the business of reconciliation and peacemaking. The United Nations may \r\nrightly take pride for having played an important part in bringing together \r\nformer ideological adversaries and brokering agreements. It has demonstrated \r\nhow effective it can be by playing a leading role in the liberation of Kuwait, \r\nshowing that it can function as its founders intended nearly half a century \r\nago. \r\nWe were at last able to look forward to a world liberated from the awful \r\nthreat of nuclear destruction, with nations enjoying the fruits of commerce \r\nand industry in peace, security, freedom and democracy. However, it now \r\nappears that we were all perhaps carried too far by the new wave of optimism. \r\nFrom the Balkans and the Black Sea basin to the Transcaucasus, and from \r\nAfghanistan to Somalia, there have emerged new conflicts pitting nations and \r\nethnic communities against one another. Now peace and security are threatened \r\nby destruction and economic ruin, compounded by the horrors of \"ethnic \r\ncleansing\" and mass starvation. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Cetin. Turkey) \r\nThe most severe challenge to the new order has been posed by the series \r\nof crises engulfing the former Yugoslavia. The international reaction to the \r\nsinister designs of the former Yugoslav army in Croatia last year was not \r\nforceful enough to deter the aggressors at that time. \r\nToday the bitter consequences of our inadequate response are being \r\nharvested throughout the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity have been violated in defiance of \r\ninternational law and the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nWhile the international community has condemned Serbian aggression and \r\nthe abhorrent practice of \"ethnic cleansing\" and demanded an immediate end to \r\nall violations of international humanitarian law, the suffering in Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina goes on. People are still getting killed. Mandatory resolutions \r\nof the Security Council are yet to be fully implemented. Hundreds of \r\nthousands of Bosnian refugees face an uncertain future away from their homes. \r\nThose surviving in the ruins of once-flourishing cities and towns are \r\nthreatened by starvation and disease. As winter approaches, the need to \r\nprovide security and shelter to the population becomes ever more pressing. I \r\nhave myself had a chance to glimpse the suffering in Sarajevo. \r\nIn addition to our international responsibility and obligations as a \r\nmember of the world community, the historical and cultural bonds which my \r\ncountry shares with the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the presence in \r\nTurkey of a large number of citizens of Bosnian descent place us in a special \r\nrelationship to the fate of this country. \r\nAt a time when Bosnia and Herzegovina are being carved up by the \r\naggressors, priority has been given to the provision of humanitarian \r\nassistance. Therefore, while supporting other efforts to reach a peaceful \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n48 \r\n(Mr. Cetin. Turkey) \r\nsettlement, we have also put forward an action plan that consists of a set of \r\nconcrete and effective measures designed to stop the fighting in that \r\ncountry. We fear that further continuation of the Bosnian conflict could lead \r\nto greater dangers. We remain prepared to assist any concerted international \r\naction to bring about an end to the Bosnian tragedy. \r\nOn Iraq, we remain concerned two years after the Gulf crisis. Baghdad \r\nhas yet to demonstrate that it truly wishes to take its rightful place in the \r\ninternational community. The Iraqi Government should comply fully with the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. My Government will be the first to \r\nwelcome a return to normality and the restoration of normal relations between \r\nIraq and its neighbours. \r\nFrom this rostrum Turkey has on many occasions expressed its consistent \r\nstand on the question of Palestine. Today, I wish to reaffirm our support for \r\nthe negotiating process on the Middle East conflict launched in Madrid in \r\nOctober 1991. This is a very important opportunity for peace, and we call on \r\nall the parties to seize it to arrive at a comprehensive and lasting \r\nsettlement on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and \r\n338 (1973). \r\nAs a neighbouring country, Turkey follows very closely the developments \r\nin the Caucasus. In this region, the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan \r\nis a source of deep concern for us because of its implications for peace and \r\nsecurity in the whole area. Turkey holds the view that in this region there \r\ncan be no place for adventurism and reckless behaviour. Armenia should \r\ndisengage from Nagorno-Karabakh and withdraw its forces from Azerbaijani \r\nterritories. We urge the parties to achieve a negotiated political solution \r\non the basis of respect for the inviolability of international borders, for \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n49-50 \r\n(Mr. Cetin. Turkey) \r\nminority rights and for the principles of the United Nations Charter and \r\nrelevant Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) obligations \r\nand commitments. We shall continue to work for peace in this region. \r\nIn the same spirit, we look forward to further progress in establishing \r\ndemocracy and restoring peaceful conditions in our neighbour and friend, \r\nGeorgia. \r\nIn Afghanistan, we had hoped that all would put aside their differences \r\nand start the process of reconciliation. However, we have been greatly \r\ndismayed by the recent eruption of fighting in Kabul. Turkey calls on all \r\nsides in Afghanistan to put an end to this fratricide and to start working for \r\npeace, so that the reconstruction and rehabilitation of this devastated \r\ncountry may begin and millions of Afghan refugees may finally return to their \r\nhomes. \r\nIn South Africa, we fully support the democratization process, which \r\nshould lead to a complete dismantling of apartheid and to the creation of a \r\nnew non-racial society in that country, based on due respect for the human \r\nrights of all South Africans. \r\nThe search for a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question continues. \r\nThe proximity talks which started on 18 June within the framework of the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s good offices mission have registered some progress and \r\nresulted in the beginning of face-to-face talks between the leaders of the two \r\ncommunities. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. Cetin. Turkey) \r\nThis positive turn in the negotiating process has been achieved in great \r\npart owing to the constructive contribution of President Denktas. However, \r\nmuch remains to be done before we can reach our objective. \r\nIt is our sincere hope that prior to the resumption of the direct talks \r\non 26 October between the leaders of the two communities, sufficient ground \r\nwill be covered so that an early completion of the work on the set of ideas \r\nwill be possible. Once that stage is reached, Turkey stands ready to \r\nparticipate in the four-party conference to conclude an overall framework \r\nagreement. \r\nWe are gratified to note that in our day democratic pluralism, the rule \r\nof law, free and fair elections and respect for human rights have finally \r\nbecome the universally accepted attributes of a modern State. The best \r\nguarantee of respect for human rights is the existence of a democratic form of \r\ngovernment. In other words, democracy and human rights are inseparable. \r\nWe welcome the progress of democracy in all regions of the world. We \r\nexpect the United Nations to play a more active role in the strengthening of \r\ndemocratic institutions. We regard the ever-growing number of requests being \r\nreceived at the United Nations to assist in the holding of elections as a very \r\nencouraging development. \r\nIn the field of human rights, no country can claim to have attained \r\nperfection. All countries experience violations of human rights, and all \r\nmust, whatever their records may be, strive to improve their performance in \r\nthis area. \r\nIn Turkey our human-rights legislation and practices are kept under \r\nconstant review in order to eliminate abuses and rectify shortcomings. As a \r\nparty to all of the European instruments and control mechanisms aimed at \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. Cetin. Turkey) \r\nprotecting human rights, as well as to the Convention against Torture and \r\nOther Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, our objective is to \r\nguarantee everyone the fullest enjoyment of human rights and to prevent any \r\nviolations or malpractices. We have made important strides in Turkey, and we \r\nare resolved to maintain this course. \r\nOn a broader plane, we are concerned with the growing incidence of \r\nxenophobia and new forms of racism that increasingly threaten the very \r\nexistence of migrant communities in Europe. Turkey is directly affected by \r\nthis negation of human values, since there are more than 2 million Turkish \r\ncitizens living in European countries, either as migrant workers or as their \r\ndependents. Like all individuals, these people too are entitled to enjoy \r\nsecurity of person and protection by the State against random violence, \r\nthreats or intimidation. We urge the host countries to ensure the protection \r\nof these individuals, to see to it that their human rights are duly respected, \r\nand effectively to prevent and punish violence and racist crimes against \r\nthem. All manifestations of xenophobia and discrimination must be curbed if \r\ntolerance and mutual understanding are to put down deep and lasting roots. \r\nNon-governmental organizations should spend more time and energy in monitoring \r\nviolations of the human rights of migrant communities. \r\nMy delegation would like to draw the attention of the General Assembly to \r\nthe widespread phenomenon of subversive violence carried out by terrorist \r\ngroups. Such violence constitutes a most serious infringement of human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms, including the basic right to life. It aims at \r\nnothing less than the destruction of democracy. This is a crucial fact which \r\nwe must never forget. We think the time has come for the relevant United \r\nNations bodies, the Rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights, and the \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Cetin. Turkey) \r\nnon-governmental organizations to address this question of terrorist violence \r\nas a matter of priority. \r\nHaving experienced rapid social change and urbanization, Turkey today \r\nseeks to improve the quality of life of its population, to ensure equal \r\nadvancement opportunities for all and to promote both individual initiative \r\nand community solidarity. We are focusing on protecting vulnerable groups so \r\nthat they can play a productive role in society. In other words, Turkey \r\nstrives to achieve economic growth with a human and social dimension. \r\nMy Government believes that social problems affecting the international \r\ncommunity will be increasingly difficult and costly to overcome if concerted \r\naction is not taken promptly. Turkey attaches great importance to \r\ninternational efforts directed at easing social problems and tensions and \r\nsupports the convening of a world summit for social development. The \r\nGovernment of Chile should be commended for its imaginative initiative in this \r\ndirection. \r\nI should now like to turn to international economic issues. The \r\npolitical developments in Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Union, the \r\naftermath of the Gulf crisis and the protracted recession in the \r\nindustrialized countries have had negative effects on the world economy. The \r\nWorld Economic Survey reports that for the first time since the First World \r\nWar the global economy has lot grown. The events of the past year have \r\ncontinued to obstruct and render fruitless the efforts of the developing \r\ncountries to restructure their economies. \r\nWith the economic policies of all countries converging as never before, \r\nthe time has come to launch a concerted effort to create an international \r\neconomic environment more congenial to growth and sustained development. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n54-55 \r\n(Mr. Cetin. Turkey) \r\nCountries with economies in transition are continuing their efforts to ensure \r\nintegration into the world economy. The major difficulties of the developing \r\ncountries are well known. \r\nWe regret that the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations has not yet been \r\nconcluded. This raises fears of protectionism. Since trade is a major \r\nvehicle for developing countries to break free of the burden of foreign debt \r\nand pursue their development efforts, the necessary political will must be \r\ndisplayed for these negotiations to be concluded successfully. \r\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development was a major \r\nstep towards broadening the scope of economic development in a sustainable \r\nmanner. The Conference accelerated the universal push towards global \r\nsustainable development. Turkey believes that this momentum is now \r\nirreversible. We must look beyond the Conference and devise policies that \r\nwould help to perpetuate and strengthen this momentum. \r\nTurkey holds the view that a good way to work towards the objectives of \r\npeace, political and social stability as well as economic development is \r\nthrough regional cooperation. The political changes of the past few years \r\nhave broadened the opportunities for such cooperation. In full awareness of \r\nthis promising trend, Turkey has taken the initiative of launching a \r\ncomprehensive scheme for expanded cooperation between the countries of the \r\nBlack Sea region. The aim of this regional cooperation is to ensure that the \r\nBlack Sea becomes an area of peace, stability and prosperity in which regional \r\ncooperation can be used as a tool to accelerate the integration of the \r\nparticipating States into the global economy. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n56 \r\n(Mr. Cetin. Turkey) \r\nAt the high-level segment of the Economic and Social Council last \r\nJuly, there was a focused discussion on restructuring the economic system \r\nof the United Nations. The economic and social structure of the United \r\nNations needs to be developed in a way that will enable it better to \r\nrespond to the growing challenges of our changing world. \r\nWith the addition of new Members, the question of the distribution of \r\nseats in United Nations bodies to geographical regions comes up for \r\nconsideration. It would be desirable also to consider whether the current \r\ngeographical groupings conform to our present-day needs. We know that the \r\nartificial division of Europe between East and West in the United Nations \r\nis the result of ideological differences which have ceased to exist. The \r\nquestion of merging the Group of Western European and Other States with \r\nthe Eastern European Group should be given active consideration. \r\nThe challenges before the United Nations are as great as ever. \r\nDespite the ending of the cold war, conflicts rage on in many parts of the \r\nworld and threaten to proliferate. Economic problems persist, made worse \r\nby a recession which will not go away. The humanitarian problems \r\nconfronting the international community have never been more daunting. \r\nThere continue to be massive violations of human rights in many parts of \r\nthe world, while the environment raises problems which we must solve if we \r\nare to survive on this planet. \r\nGreat as these challenges are, we have in the United Nations a \r\ncomprehensive framework within which we can operate and address mankind\u0027s \r\nproblems. The end of ideological conflicts makes this possible. The \r\nrestructuring carried out in the Secretariat under the leadership of our \r\nnewly elected Secretary-General is a good beginning in strengthening our \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Cetin. Turkey) \r\nnewly elected Secretary-General is a good beginning in strengthening our \r\nOrganization. There is a new spirit in the Security Council and in the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. The General Assembly has never been more \r\nrepresentative. The report of the Secretary-General entitled \"An Agenda for \r\nPeace\" (A/47/277) provides, in a timely manner, the intellectual foundation \r\nfor our future activities. The United Nations must not only set the tone and \r\nprovide political guidance to regional organizations in their efforts to \r\nsecure peace, but must also be prepared to assume its leadership role. It \r\nmust not fail to live up to its responsibilities under the Charter. The \r\nconditions are right for the great challenges to be met successfully. For the \r\nUnited Nations to pass the test, everything depends on the Members who must \r\nact in concert and with courage. My delegation undertakes to work with other \r\ndelegations in a spirit of cooperation and compromise so that our Organization \r\nmay live up to its high promise and serve mankind at this crucial time. \r\nMr. ANDREWS (Ireland): I extend my warm congratulations to you, \r\nSir, and to Bulgaria on your election to the office of President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Ireland, as one of the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly, \r\nlooks forward to cooperating closely with you as you guide our work at this \r\nsession of the Assembly. \r\nIn the weeks ahead the Assembly will examine many aspects of current \r\ninternational life. But today I want to focus on two issues that I believe, \r\nmy country believes, my Government believes, require our urgent attention. \r\nFirst, we must act now to save the millions starving in Somalia; and \r\nsecondly, the United Nations must move the questions of justice and \r\ndevelopment to the top of its agenda. We have had too many Somalias. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr. Andrews. Ireland) \r\nOur Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, is the first African to lead \r\nthe Organization, and I wish to begin my short address with that particular \r\ncontinent. \r\nLast month I spent three or four days in Somalia, and I will shortly \r\nreturn there with the President of Ireland, Mary Robinson. She has decided to \r\nvisit Somalia to show solidarity with the people of that starving land, and to \r\nunderline the compelling need for more effective international action. \r\nMy visit was a profoundly disturbing experience. Words fail before the \r\nscale of the catastrophe and the depth of the suffering. Yesterday at one \r\nfeeding station alone in Baidoa, which I visited during my visit, 532 people \r\ndied in one day. Today, many more will die. And tomorrow. Until we act. It \r\nis a scandal. It is a scandal for Somalia\u0027s leaders who continue to squabble \r\nand fight while their people continue to starve and die. It is a scandal for \r\noutsiders, for the developed world, for the membership of the United Nations, \r\nwho have failed to respond swiftly and effectively.* \r\nThroughout, international non-governmental organizations and \r\norganizations from my own country have taken the lead, and I believe it is now \r\ntime for Governments and the international community to follow. I pay a \r\ntribute to their humanitarian work and their determined efforts to confront us \r\nwith this appalling crisis. Their generosity and courage should inspire a more \r\ncomprehensive and committed response from the international community. \r\nWhat must be done? \r\nFirst, we must increase the volume of food and relief supplies reaching \r\nSomalia. Unless 60,000 tons of food can be distributed each month, children, \r\nwomen and old people will continue to die. There will be more Baidoas. \r\n* Mr. Kalpage (Sri Lanka), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n59 \r\n(Mr. Andrews. Ireland) \r\nSecondly, food and medicine must be distributed in conditions of civil \r\norder. Ambassador Sahnoun, the exceptional and very worthy Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, is \r\nvigorously promoting improved security. He deserves our full support. The \r\ndeployment of United Nations troops will provide an essential measure of \r\nprotection for food distribution. We must all, particularly the regional \r\norganizations and Somalia\u0027s neighbours, impress on clan and faction leaders \r\nthe need to cooperate fully with the aid effort. \r\nThirdly, we must work for a process of national reconciliation and for \r\nthe formation of a Government with national authority. A political solution \r\nis essential for long-term recovery and to prevent a relapse into the horror \r\nthat we now witness daily. \r\nThe international community has the resources and the skills to save \r\nSomalia. What is needed is the political will and the organizational drive to \r\nharness those resources and deploy those skills. We have no more urgent task. \r\nFor all our honest endeavours, we live in a world beset by inequality, by \r\ngross disparities and imbalances of wealth and resources. So often do nature \r\nand society combine to perpetuate injustice that the sceptic might conclude \r\nthat humanity\u0027s best efforts are more often than not unequal to the challenge. \r\nOur \"Agenda for Peace\" must embrace also an agenda for justice and \r\ncompassion. This imperative was obscured by the cold war. \r\nIt is perhaps understandable that throughout those dangerous years \r\ninternational attention and political energies were absorbed by questions of \r\nsecurity. But the era of ideological confrontation is, happily, over and at \r\nan end. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n60 \r\n(Mr. Andrews. Ireland) \r\nWe must grasp this opportunity to build a more humane and just \r\ninternational system, a system that will focus on the welfare of the \r\nindividual the need for food and shelter, for human rights, for political \r\nfreedom and for equality. We cannot forget that the same Charter that assigns \r\nto the United Nations responsibility for preserving international peace and \r\nsecurity also gives the United Nations major responsibilities for promoting \r\nsocial and economic development. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n61 \r\n(Mr. Andrews. Ireland) \r\nThe moral responsibility of the international donor community is clear. \r\nNone of us finds it easy to allocate extra resources for aid in the current \r\ndifficult economic climate, but we have an obligation to provide adequate \r\nhumanitarian relief for immediate crises, as well as financial and technical \r\nassistance for longer-term development. For reasons of size and economic \r\ncircumstances, the scope for Ireland to donate significant amounts of aid \r\nremains limited. However, I can say that private support in Ireland for \r\nnon-governmental organizations involved in development has grown steadily. \r\nToday Ireland has the highest rate of private development assistance, as a \r\nproportion of gross national product, of all countries in the world. The \r\nIrish people have themselves shown their generosity, and the Irish Government \r\naims to respond by increasing our official development assistance. \r\nBut the effort called for is wider than development assistance. \r\nNotwithstanding the end of the cold war and the disappearance of East-West \r\nconfrontation, the opportunities for international cooperation are not being \r\ngrasped. It is simply unacceptable that most Africans are poorer today than \r\nthey were 30 years ago, that in a world that spends a trillion dollars every \r\nyear on weapons of the most sophisticated kind we cannot find the resources to \r\nprovide bread and clean water for millions of our fellow citizens. What is \r\nmissing is a clear political focus and, by definition, a clear, directed \r\npolitical will. \r\nAlready the international community has made a connection between the \r\nenvironment and development. But there are other areas in which we must look \r\nfor new and broader approaches: in the international financial and economic \r\nsystem; in spending on armaments; and in the way in which our international \r\norganizations work. Economic activity cannot be divorced from political \r\nresponsibility. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Andrews. Ireland) \r\nHow welcome it would be if the quality of analysis and the clarity of \r\ndirection contained in the Secretary-General\u0027s \"Agenda for Peace\" could be \r\nbrought to bear on a new agenda an agenda for justice and development if, \r\nwhen we meet here again a year from now, we were to have a thorough report, \r\nbearing the authority of the Secretary-General, which would point the way \r\nforward on aid, trade, finance, commodities and debt, a report that would \r\ndevelop concrete proposals to remedy the organizational deficiencies that so \r\noften thwart our best intentions. I believe that in the years ahead the \r\nsuccess of our Organization will be measured not only by its response to \r\nindividual situations of conflict but also by the way in which it deals with \r\nthese urgent questions of development. \r\nThe end of East-West rivalry has not brought an end to conflict or \r\nthreats to peace. On the contrary, many disputes frozen by the cold war have \r\nre-emerged with vicious and deadly impact. We must intensify our cooperation \r\non international peace and security. The January summit of the Security \r\nCouncil was a timely initiative, which has led directly to the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s ambitious and thought-provoking document \"An Agenda for \r\nPeace\". That document assembles a range of important ideas for consolidation \r\nof the peace-keeping activities of the United Nations, as well as for \r\nextension of the role of the United Nations into the new areas of preventive \r\ndiplomacy, peacemaking and peace-building. \r\nIreland has long supported the peace-keeping activities of the United \r\nNations. Today my country, small though it may be in population and in \r\nresources, participates in 10 of the 12 peace-keeping missions currently in \r\nthe field. But, like the Secretary-General, we have felt the need to develop \r\nfurther the capacity of the United Nations to make and keep the peace. We \r\ntherefore endorse the direction of the Secretary-General\u0027s thinking. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. Andrews. Ireland) \r\nI welcome in particular the attention given to preventive action. The \r\nearlier the United Nations can identify and act on a threat to the peace, the \r\nbetter are the chances of averting the outbreak or prospective outbreak of \r\nhostilities. The proposals for fact-finding missions, for improved early \r\nwarning and for the preventive deployment of United Nations forces can and \r\nshould be implemented now. \r\nWe also support the Secretary-General\u0027s proposals for the strengthening \r\nof peace-keeping. The activities of the United Nations in this area are \r\namongst the most innovative achievements of our age. We are prepared to work \r\nactively with the Secretariat and with other member States in coping with the \r\nnew demands and problems that have emerged in relation to logistics, \r\nequipment, personnel and finance. \r\nI want to say a brief word about the financing of the United Nations. \r\nHere, I am struck by the Secretary-General\u0027s clear and urgent warning about \r\nthe poor financial health of the Organization. At the very moment when the \r\nUnited Nations has begun to assume a more effective role in the interests of \r\npeace, when it is looked to by suffering people everywhere to provide \r\nprotection and aid, its work is hampered by financial uncertainty. \r\nLet me put it simply: the Organization cannot function effectively, \r\ncannot meet the demands that we the members make upon it, unless all Member \r\nStates pay their assessed contributions in full and on time. We call on all \r\nmembers to fulfil their financial obligations under the Charter, and we look \r\nto the General Assembly, at its current session, to adopt measures to put the \r\nOrganization on a secure financial footing. \r\nI know that reform of the United Nations - and, in particular, of the \r\nSecurity Council is a sensitive issue that touches the very essence of \r\npost-war international cooperation. But, after almost 50 years it is \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n64 \r\n(Mr. Andrews. Ireland) \r\nreasonable to ask if the structures and methods of work agreed upon then \r\ncorrespond fully with contemporary realities with the growing, and now \r\nalmost universal, membership of the United Nations; with the Organization\u0027s \r\nnew tasks; and with the great changes that have taken place in economic and \r\npolitical relations. \r\nThe time has come to take up these issues frankly here within the \r\nUnited Nations itself. We can only profit from such a discussion. Our aim \r\nshould be to ensure that the decisions of the Organization are truly \r\nauthoratitive and representative of the will of the entire international \r\ncommunity. \r\nOne of the most significant achievements of this century has been the \r\ndevelopment of an ethic, a morality, of human rights. We have set our face \r\nuncompromisingly against violations of human rights - against torture, \r\nslavery, apartheid. It is simply not acceptable that an individual can be \r\nsacrificed to the interests of a State system rendered nameless, an \r\nafterthought as history marches on. \r\nOur modern ethic extends to the realization that human rights are \r\nessential in relations between States as well as in our national political \r\nsystems. None of us can turn our backs on systematic violations of human \r\nrights or retain full trust and confidence in those responsible for such \r\nviolations. To respect human rights is to respect conscience itself, whose \r\npower for good has been illustrated many times in the course of this century \r\nby a Mahatma Gandhi, by a Martin Luther King, or, in the past few years, by a \r\nVaclav Havel or a Nelson Mandela, who, from a prison cell - \"enduring the \r\nmost\" changed his country\u0027s history. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n65 \r\n(Mr. Andrews. Ireland) \r\nBy upholding the rights of the individual we bring the welfare and \r\ndignity of men and women to the centre of our political preoccupations. This \r\nmust be the central message for next year\u0027s world conference on human rights, \r\nbut I am deeply concerned that it is in danger of being lost sight of in the \r\npreparatory work. In this of all fields, we must escape from an adversarial \r\napproach and hold firmly in view the meaning of our work for the suffering of \r\nthe many. \r\nI should like to make a few remarks in connection with disarmament. We \r\ncannot slacken in our determination to make progress on disarmament and arms \r\ncontrol. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the development \r\nof new and sophisticated conventional weapons pose a major threat to \r\ninternational peace and security and to regional stability. \r\nI welcome the recent agreement in the Conference on Disarmament on the \r\nchemical-weapons Convention. I welcome too the accession of France and China \r\nto the nuclear-non-proliferation Treaty. As we prepare for the 1995 Review \r\nConference, we appeal to those countries that remain outside the Treaty to \r\njoin us in making the non-proliferation regime truly universal. This is a \r\ngoal for which Ireland has long striven. The effort to reduce and eliminate \r\nnuclear weapons and to end nuclear testing once and for all must be \r\nredoubled. Nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction can have no \r\nplace in our future security relations. \r\nThe British Foreign Secretary has already spoken in the name of the \r\ntwelve member States of the European Community about the major regional \r\nchallenges confronting our world the Middle East, Cambodia, South Africa, \r\nYugoslavia and other conflicts and I fully endorse his statements in that \r\nregard. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n66 \r\n(Mr. Andrews. Ireland) \r\nOver the past year, the Irish Government has worked tirelessly for the \r\nresumption of political dialogue which might lead to a lasting and \r\ncomprehensive settlement of the problem of Northern Ireland. I am happy to \r\nreport that our efforts bore fruit with the recommencement some months ago of \r\na process of dialogue and negotiation involving the Irish and the British \r\nGovernments and the constitutional political parties in Northern Ireland. The \r\nshared objective of this process is \r\n\"to achieve a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland, \r\nwithin the island of Ireland and between the peoples of these islands\". \r\nThe Irish Government will do everything in its power to reach a \r\nsettlement which will overcome present divisions and lay the foundations for \r\nlasting peace, stability and reconciliation among the Irish people. We \r\nbelieve such a settlement can be achieved only on the basis of the equal \r\nlegitimacy of the two traditions which exist on our island. The nationalist \r\nand unionist traditions are equally valid. Each must be accorded equal \r\nrespect and given meaningful political expression in new political \r\narrangements. \r\nA valuable acknowledgement of the rights of the two traditions exists \r\nalready in the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Over the past seven years, the \r\nAgreement has performed an extremely valuable role as an instrument of \r\ncooperation between the Irish and British Governments on a wide range of \r\nmatters relating to Northern Ireland. Issues which have received particular \r\nattention include relations between the security forces and the community in \r\nNorthern Ireland; public confidence in the administration of justice; respect \r\nfor human rights and the law; the prevention of discrimination wherever it \r\nexists and the development of greater North/South economic cooperation. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n67 \r\n(Mr. Andrews. Ireland) \r\nThe Irish Government has made it clear that we would be prepared to \r\nconsider a new and more broadly based agreement or structure if such an \r\narrangement can be arrived at through direct discussion and negotiation \r\nbetween all of the parties concerned. The present talks are exploring that \r\npossibility. In our view, arrangements must build upon, rather than detract \r\nfrom, the crucial contribution made by the Anglo-Irish Agreement to political \r\nprogress. \r\nIt is our earnest hope that the process of dialogue which is under way at \r\npresent, and in which I am personally participating, will lead to agreed \r\narrangements which represent a fair and honourable accommodation between the \r\ntwo traditions on the island of Ireland. Nationalists and unionists must both \r\nfeel that their political, civil, economic and social rights are fully \r\nprotected and that structures are in place which respect and accommodate their \r\nrespective aspirations. \r\nAll of the participants in the present talks are committed to a \r\nforward-looking and constructive approach. For our part, we in the Irish \r\nGovernment are prepared to bring all the necessary reserves of good will and \r\npatience to bear in the search for an agreed outcome. The best hope of \r\nultimate success lies in the insistent desire for peace on the part of the \r\nvast majority of Irish people, in both North and South, and our determination \r\nthat the violence and turmoil which has been suffered over the past 23 years \r\nin Northern Ireland and on the island of Ireland shall not be visited upon \r\nfuture generations. \r\nThose who resort to violence in the pursuit of political aims are the \r\nenemies of the Irish people. They seek an Ireland built not on respect for \r\nthe aspirations of each tradition but on bloodshed, hatred and despair. All \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n68 \r\n(Mr. Andrews. Ireland) \r\nthe efforts of the Irish Government are directed towards the creation of \r\nconditions which will ensure that the scourge of violence is removed for \r\never. \r\nThe only true path to peace, justice and stability lies in the healing of \r\nwounds and in reconciliation between the two traditions on a basis of complete \r\nequality. There is much that divides the two traditions but there is even \r\nmore that unites us. The common ground between North and South, I have no \r\ndoubt, will be significantly expanded by our joint progress over the years \r\nahead along the road towards European union. By building on our shared values \r\nand objectives, we will bring closer the peaceful and stable future to which \r\nwe all aspire. \r\nMr. ABDULLAH (Oman) (interpretation from Arabic): Allow me at the 4̂v \r\noutset. Sir, to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the \r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly. There is no doubt that your \r\ndiplomatic experience will lead our deliberations to a successful conclusion. \r\nAllow me also to take this opportunity to thank and congratulate \r\nHis Excellency Ambassador Samir Shihabi and the members of his Bureau for the \r\nexemplary manner in which they steered the work of the forty-sixth session. \r\nWe are quite fortunate to have at the head of the United Nations \r\nOrganization so highly qualified and skilful a statesman as \r\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has assumed the responsibilities \r\nof this international Organization at a most sensitive and crucial time in \r\ninternational relations. \r\nSince his recent assumption of his office, his administrative skills and \r\nabilities and the structural reforms he has carried out have shown that he is \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n69-70 \r\n(Mr. Abdullah. Oman) \r\na worthy successor to his capable predecessor. We thank him for his devoted \r\nefforts, especially in areas of unrest and tension, and wish him continued \r\nsuccess. \r\nThe forty-seventh session of the General Assembly is convened in a \r\npromising climate that augurs well for international relations. The \r\ndiscernable features of the political scene have been drastically \r\ntransformed. Confrontation has disappeared, giving way to great expectations \r\nand aspirations regarding an unshakable belief in the basic rights of man, the \r\nupholding of justice and the social and economic development of peoples in the \r\ncontext of a new world order. \r\nThe prevalent international climate provides us with a rare opportunity \r\nto give priority to human solidarity and cooperation over any other \r\nconsideration in order for us to establish that new world order on the secure \r\nfoundations of peace, mutual security and respect, and the promotion of the \r\nrule of law in inter-State relations. \r\nThe hopes and aspirations focused on the new world order, require, more \r\nthan ever, that the Member States work together, analyse the current trends \r\nand channel them, as much as possible, towards the realization of the \r\nexpectations this new world order has given rise to, through a number of \r\neffective joint actions of solidarity and cooperation that would be more \r\neffective than mere protestations of good wishes and good intentions. \r\nIt is encouraging to note that the universality of the United Nations is \r\nbeing enhanced day after day. Since the last session of the General Assembly, \r\nthirteen more States have acceded to the membership of the Organization, \r\nnamely Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kazakhstan, \r\nKyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, \r\nTurkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Georgia. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n71 \r\n(Mr. Abdulla, Oman) \r\nWe welcome the admission of these 13 States to our Organization for, in \r\naddition to its significance for the principle of the universality of the \r\nOrganization, they will no doubt enrich our debates with valuable insights and \r\nviews. \r\nMy country welcomes these new Members to the United Nations and wishes \r\nthem and their peoples every progress and prosperity. \r\nThe Gulf, in view of its God-given strategic, economic and cultural \r\nimportance, has always been the focus of the attention of numerous States. \r\nOver the past decade and at the outset of the present one, the region has been \r\nexposed to grave security and environmental dangers, from the eruption of the \r\nIran-Iraq war to the tragedy of the Iraqi occupation of the sister State of \r\nKuwait. Thanks to God and to the solidarity of the international community, \r\nwe have been able to overcome these tribulations. \r\nHowever, the remnants of regional disputes and residues of traditional \r\nhatreds have the ability to contribute to the instability of the region. \r\nHence, we, in the Sultanate of Oman, proceeding from our keen interest in \r\nencouraging the factors of stability in the region, and seeking the security \r\nto which we all aspire, feel that it is high time efforts of all States in the \r\nregion, without exception, were devoted to prepare for a new phase of \r\nunderstanding and fraternity. This will be achieved only through a sincere \r\nexamination and analysis of what has happened and sincere efforts to overcome \r\nthe effects of the past and heal its many wounds. \r\nAt the beginning of this month, the United Arab Emirates announced that \r\nefforts they had exerted vis-a-vis the Islamic Republic of Iran this year have \r\nfailed. The aim was to achieve an amicable understanding regarding Oman\u0027s \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n72 \r\n(Mr. Abdulla. Oman) \r\nsovereign rights over three islands in the Gulf: Abu Moussa, Greater Tanb and \r\nSmaller Tanb. The Sultanate of Oman is gravely concerned over the prospects \r\nof negative developments in this situation. \r\nProceeding from our belief in the principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations regarding the respect for sovereignty of States, non-interference in \r\nthe internal affairs of others and peaceful settlement of disputes, we have \r\nconfirmed the rights of the United Arab Emirates in this regard, as did the \r\nother Arab States and now call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran, with whom we \r\nhave friendly ties and mutual interests, to settle this dispute by peaceful \r\nmeans in a manner that would guarantee the rights and common interests of the \r\nStates in the Gulf Cooperation Council. \r\nThe problem of Palestine has been the major factor underlying the \r\ntragedies and wars witnessed by the peoples of the Middle East region. Peace \r\nand stability in this important and delicate region cannot be achieved without \r\nfinding a solution to this problem, which is the crux of the Arab-Israeli \r\nconflict. \r\nMy country supports the sincere efforts being made to find a lasting, \r\njust and peaceful solution, which would take into account the interests of all \r\nparties in the region on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) \r\nand 338 (1973) and the principle of land-for-peace. \r\nProceeding from this, my country has participated in the International \r\nPeace Conference on the Middle East sponsored by the United States of America \r\nand the Russian Federation. My country has also participated in the \r\nmultilateral negotiations of the Conference and the Working Groups thereof, \r\nout of its belief in the importance of supporting direct negotiations, which \r\nare the basis and essence of the Conference as a means of contributing to the \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n73 \r\n(Mr. Abdulla. Oman) \r\nachievement of regional security, cooperation and confidence-building among \r\nStates in the region and thereby contributing to the safeguarding of the \r\ninterests of all parties. \r\nThe recent developments witnessed by the region, in addition to what has \r\nbeen achieved in the sixth round of the Arab-Israeli talks and the \r\nmultilateral negotiations held recently in Washington and Moscow, have created \r\ncircumstances that are more favourable than ever for the achievement of a \r\npermanent and just solution that would bring peace to the area. Therefore, we \r\ncall upon all parties to exert more efforts and show more patience and \r\nflexibility in order to achieve the permanent and lasting peace to which the \r\npeoples of the region have long aspired. \r\nThe Middle East region has witnessed other developments that give rise to \r\nsatisfaction and optimism. The Government of Lebanon has taken new positive \r\nsteps to extend its sovereignty over the territory of Lebanon by way of \r\nimplementing the Taif agreement. In this regard, my country once again \r\nreiterates its call for the implementation of Security Council resolution \r\n425 (1978), which calls for the withdrawal of Israel from the Lebanese \r\nterritories that it occupies. \r\nMy country, through its membership in the Gulf Cooperation Council, \r\ntogether with its sisters on the Council, appreciates the outstanding role of \r\nthe European community in articulating the orientations of the new world order \r\nin the context of the significant role played by the Community in preserving \r\nstability and security and promoting development in the world. \r\nThe two groups, the GCC and the EEC have stressed the need to promote the \r\npeace process in the Middle East, have called upon the international community \r\nto help alleviate the suffering of the Arabs in the occupied territories and \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n74-75 \r\n(Mr. Abdulla. Oman) \r\nhave shown readiness to participate in the reconstruction of Lebanon and \r\nreactivate the Arab-European dialogue in recognition of the close links \r\nbetween the security of the Middle East and the security of Europe. \r\nAfter a protracted bitter struggle, the Afghan people, with God\u0027s help, \r\nhas managed to assume control over its country. The Sultanate of Oman did \r\nrecognize the Government of the Mujahideen, and has welcomed the assumption by \r\nthe Mujahideen Council to power in Afghanistan. My country is confident that \r\nthe new Government in Afghanistan will cope with the new challenges which face \r\nit judiciously and competently. We hope that the international community will \r\nhasten to assist the new Afghan Government to heal the wounds and to close the \r\nbook on the past in order to build a future of security, stability and \r\nprosperity for Afghanistan. \r\nThe hotbeds of conflict and the regional and domestic disputes based on \r\nrace and narrow political outlooks still plague some States and impose an \r\nadditional burden on the international Organization. Examples of this is what \r\nis happening in the sister State of Somalia and in the former Yugoslavia. \r\nThese racial conflicts and disputes have led to the emergence of a large \r\nnumber of displaced persons who are subjected to the worst kinds of starvation \r\nand displacement. While we commend the role of the United Nations in \r\nalleviating the suffering of these peoples, whether in Somalia or in the \r\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, we note that that role has been limited to \r\ndealing with these problems from a purely humanitarian point of view. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n76 \r\n(Mr. Abdulla. Oman) \r\nIf the United Nations role remains within those limits, such situations \r\nwill persist. \r\nDealing with such tragedies, in our view, requires a much wider role, \r\nmore efforts and a drive to force the warring political factions in Somalia to \r\nmove towards reconciliation. \r\nWe look forward to a more comprehensive and effective role that would put \r\nan end to the fratricidal hostilities that are the source of these tragedies. \r\nFailing this, the people\u0027s suffering will continue for a long time and could \r\nthreaten peace and security. \r\nPositive indicators in connection with the situation in South Africa bode \r\nwell for finding a solution that would be acceptable to all the parties \r\nconcerned and that would enable the black majority to participate in \r\ngovernment on a democratic basis. In this regard, we emphasize the importance \r\nof the United Nations role in bringing closer the views of the parties \r\nconcerned in South Africa and in helping them to sit at the negotiating table \r\nwith the aim of finding solutions that may be acceptable to all. \r\nThe international community witnessed, at the end of last year, the most \r\nimportant historical event in the international arena since the end of the \r\nSecond World War, namely the emergence of the republics of the former Soviet \r\nUnion as sovereign States, which immediately received the official recognition \r\nof all countries, including my own. As Oman\u0027s policy is to build bridges of \r\nfriendship with all States of the world, we have recognized those independent \r\nStates and proffered the hand of friendship and cooperation to them. Those \r\nrepublics have proved that the human spirit is invincible, and today, as they \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n77 \r\n(Mr. Abdulla. Oman) \r\ntake their first steps on a new road, it is incumbent upon the international \r\ncommunity to support and assist them in the interests of a new world order \r\nbased on international stability and security. \r\nLast June, the city of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil, hosted an unprecedented \r\ninternational gathering that sought to realize a common dream, a common cause \r\nthat knows no boundaries: that of preserving a sound and sustainable \r\nenvironment in the interests of all mankind. Although they fell short of \r\nexpectations, the results of the United Nations Conference on Environment and \r\nDevelopment (UNCED) have succeeded in endorsing an important principle: that \r\nof the commensurate and just participation of States in the protection of the \r\nenvironment and the preservation of the ecosystem. \r\nThe adoption by the Conference of a set of the 27 principles concerned \r\nwith environmentally sound development, in the Rio Declaration, and the \r\nsigning by more than 150 States of the Conventions on biological diversity and \r\nclimate change represent a step in the right direction towards the \r\nharmonization of development and the environment. My country urges the \r\ninternational community to support and implement the Conventions and decisions \r\nof the Conference, especially those which relate to helping the developing \r\ncountries overcome their environmental problems, by way of consolidating the \r\nspirit of world partnership with the purpose of saving the planet. \r\nIn the field of disarmament, we commend the agreement between the United \r\nStates of America and the Russian Federation to reduce their strategic weapons \r\nto one third of their present levels. We feel that this agreement should be \r\nan incentive to make more determined efforts to free the world of nuclear and \r\nother weapons of mass destruction and, thereby, achieve the goal of complete \r\nand general disarmament, which is indispensable for world peace and security. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n78 \r\n(Mr. Abdulla. Oman) \r\nBy the same token, the adoption of the global Convention on chemical weapons \r\nis a significant step in the right direction. \r\nThe United Nations has clearly achieved impressive successes in dealing \r\nwith questions of peace and security. However, peace is not merely the \r\nabsence of war, or the simple relaxation of tension between East and West. \r\nPeace cannot be achieved in its more comprehensive sense without a \r\nmultilateral transformation of the world economy. The eradication of poverty, \r\nthe resolution of problems that stand in the way of progress, such as \r\nindebtedness and the deterioration of commodity prices, the reversing of the \r\nnet flow of resources from the South to the North, and the transfer of \r\ntechnology, should all become part and parcel of the policies aimed at the \r\nmaintenance of peace assigned to the United Nations. \r\nThe new realities of international relations should be the source of \r\ninspiration to us to reactivate international cooperation in the field of \r\ndevelopment. The end of ideological conflicts has increased the importance of \r\nthis joint responsibility and the need for joint action. Hence the \r\nopportunity for us all to work together in laying the foundations of the \r\ncooperation and interdependence which we still lack in the fields of \r\ndevelopment and international economic cooperation. \r\nThe polarizations and armed conflicts which used to be the hallmark of \r\npast decades had prevented the United Nations from achieving its designated \r\ngoal: a more secure and peaceful world. However, recent developments have \r\nshown how successful the United Nations can be in dealing with and finding \r\nsolutions to chronic and complex issues if its endeavours enjoy the support of \r\nMember States, as is the case, for example, with regard to the Organization\u0027s \r\npeace-keeping operations. The number of peace-keeping operations undertaken \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n79-80 \r\n(Mr. Abdulla. Oman) \r\nby the United Nations over the past four years equals that of all such \r\noperations, during the last four decades of the Organization\u0027s history. This \r\nclearly indicates that whenever genuine political will exists on the part of \r\nthe parties to any conflict, it becomes possible to find a solution or at \r\nleast to accelerate the process of finding a solution that may lead to \r\nreconciliation. \r\nWith renewed optimism, my country shares the hope of the international \r\ncommunity that the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly will be able \r\nto deal successfully with residual situations involving negative and \r\nanachronistic elements that are out of step with the thrust of the new world \r\norder, and thus usher in a new phase of cooperation and peaceful coexistence \r\nbetween all the States and peoples of the world. \r\nMr. HANNIBALSSON (Iceland): I wish to join previous speakers in \r\ncongratulating Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency. I am glad to see \r\nthis important office occupied by a representative of one of Europe\u0027s new \r\ndemocracies. \r\nThis year 13 new Members are joining our Organization: nine former \r\nSoviet republics as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia and San \r\nMarino. Iceland sincerely welcomes them all and looks forward to working with \r\nthem in this forum in the future. \r\nThe present is in many ways a time of remarkable opportunities for the \r\nUnited Nations.\u0027 The continued improvement of the international situation has \r\nover the past year inspired our Organization with a bold new optimism. We now \r\nhave a realistic chance of breathing new life into the United Nations Charter \r\nand working in concert for the betterment of the world we live in. It is a \r\nchance none of us can afford to miss. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n81 \r\n(Mr. Hannibalsson. Iceland) \r\nSince the last session of the General Assembly important strides have \r\nbeen made towards the establishment of a safer and more predictable \r\ninternational environment. Progress has been substantial in the area of \r\narms control and disarmament. For over 40 years the peoples of the world \r\nhave been haunted by the spectre of nuclear holocaust. Owing largely to \r\nthe fundamental changes that have taken place in the former Soviet Union, \r\nthe role of nuclear weapons is quickly diminishing. The announcement by \r\nPresidents Bush and Yeltsin last June of dramatic cuts in the strategic \r\narsenals of their countries was an important milestone in this regard. \r\nThe draft Convention on chemical weapons, adopted by the Conference on \r\nDisarmament earlier this month, represents another major step towards the \r\neventual elimination of all types of weapons of mass destruction. \r\nThe deterrence of war, a guiding principle of the cold war, is giving \r\nway to a different demand: the preservation of peace. As the emphasis \r\nshifts from military to economic and political means of obtaining \r\nsecurity in effect from strategy to diplomacy the United Nations \r\nshould also be given increasing scope for action. \r\nDiplomacy is bringing gains in regional disputes that have long been \r\nmajor issues on the United Nations agenda. In the Middle East a historic \r\nbreakthrough has taken place with the initiation of the peace process \r\nstarted at Madrid. Forty-four years after the establishment of the State \r\nof Israel, Israelis and Palestinians are finally sitting at the same table \r\nand negotiating their differences. Setbacks notwithstanding, important \r\nsteps have been taken by the Government of South Africa to abolish the \r\nnotorious system of apartheid. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n82 \r\n(Mr. Hannibalsson. Iceland) \r\nNot least among the positive aspects of recent events is the growing \r\nrecognition of the legitimate role of the United Nations in upholding \r\ncollective security. In only four years the total of new United Nations \r\npeace-keeping operations has equalled the number of such operations over a \r\nperiod of 40 years previously. Clearly, however. United Nations \r\npeace-keeping will be viable only as long as the political will to deploy \r\npeace-keeping forces is matched by the resources to sustain them. \r\nA great deal has been achieved, raising hopes for the future of our \r\nOrganization. But this is not the time for complacency. There are still \r\nserious stumbling blocks on the road to genuine peace and security. \r\nOvercoming them requires redoubled efforts by the world community and \r\nindividual States. \r\nReductions in nuclear arsenals, already agreed, will take years to \r\naccomplish. In the meantime, proliferation of dangerous weapons will \r\ncontinue apace, unless measures are taken to combat this menace \r\neffectively. Should our combined efforts fail, we may face a paradoxical \r\nsituation in which the world becomes less dependent on nuclear weapons but \r\nat the same time more unstable and more militarized. \r\nFurthermore, violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms are \r\nstill taking place on a large scale. The United Nations has been \r\nsuccessful in the progressive development and codification of human \r\nrights. But setting standards is not enough. We must also ensure that \r\nthey are respected. It is in that spirit that Iceland looks forward to \r\nnext year\u0027s World Conference on Human Rights. We sincerely hope that the \r\nfinal outcome of the Conference will be a stepping stone towards a more \r\neffective implementation of human-rights standards all round the world. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n83 \r\n(Mr. Hannibalsson. Iceland) \r\nWhile the ice cap of the cold war has melted, national and ethnic \r\nrivalries have been rekindled, creating new dangers of regional \r\ninstability. Ominous seeds of future intolerance and violence may have \r\nbeen sown through the appalling human-rights abuses and outright \r\natrocities committed in some of the States of the former Yugoslavia. In a \r\nbrutal conflict like the one we are witnessing in Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\nthere are always shades of grey between black and white. No single party \r\ncan be assigned sole responsibility. However, the territorial gains made \r\nby one of the parties, its overwhelming military superiority and the \r\nethnic origin and number of refugees are uncontested facts which \r\neloquently speak for themselves. \r\nAll efforts unilaterally to change internationally recognized \r\nboundaries must be unreservedly condemned, as must the barbarous practice \r\nof \"ethnic cleansing\"- At the same time, all parties to the conflict must \r\nbe brought to realize that a solution can be found only through peaceful \r\nmeans and not on the battlefield. The relevant measures of the Security \r\nCouncil, including sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of \r\nYugoslavia, must be scrupulously adhered to. In this context, Iceland \r\nwelcomes the results of the recent London Conference and looks forward to \r\nits follow-up in Geneva. \r\nTragic circumstances in the former Yugoslavia must not, however, be \r\nallowed to divert our attention from the deplorable situation which \r\ncurrently prevails in war-torn and famine-stricken Somalia. A quarter of \r\nSomali children have already died from malnutrition and disease this year, \r\nand a million more are similarly at risk in the coming months. Effective \r\ninternational coordination of relief efforts, including improved \r\ncoordination between all relevant United Nations bodies, is the key to any \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n84 \r\n(Mr. Hannibalsson. Iceland) \r\nimprovement of the situation. Moreover, we must draw proper lessons from \r\nthis unfortunate and disastrous experience and spare no effort to ensure \r\nthat our Organization can respond in a timely and more effective manner to \r\ncatastrophes like the one in Somalia. \r\nReturning to Europe, we find that parts of the legacy of the last 40 \r\nyears have not yet been successfully eradicated. Last year we welcomed \r\nthe three Baltic States, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as sovereign \r\nMembers of the United Nations. The continued stationing of foreign troops \r\non the soil of those countries without their consent and in the absence \r\nof a firm timetable for withdrawal remains, however, a source of serious \r\nconcern. At their meeting in Bornholm last month the Prime Ministers of \r\nthe five Nordic countries emphasized that the earliest possible withdrawal \r\nof foreign military forces from the three Baltic States would contribute \r\nto the stability of the region as a whole. Iceland welcomes the recent \r\naccord on a troop pull-out from Lithuania by August next year, and hopes \r\nthat the agreement will herald an orderly, complete and unconditional \r\nwithdrawal of foreign troops from all three Baltic States. \r\nSuch anachronisms notwithstanding, the passing of the cold war has, \r\non the whole, created new openings in the areas of economic, social and \r\nenvironmental cooperation. This applies not least in the area of trade. \r\nAt a time when the virtues of free trade are extolled by East and West \r\nalike and the importance of having a clear and predictable framework for \r\nworld trade is greater than ever, it is paradoxical that the Uruguay \r\nRound, launched more than six years ago, should be running two years \r\nbehind schedule and even be in danger of imminent collapse. At stake are \r\nbillions of dollars worth of world trade, as well as countless new job \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n85 \r\n(Mr. Hannibalsson. Iceland) \r\nopportunities. We cannot afford to give up. Surrender would stall growth \r\nin the industrialized countries and slow down the integration of the \r\ndeveloping countries and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe into \r\nthe world trade system. We have to introduce the principles of free trade \r\nthat have served us so well in industry into hitherto protected sectors, \r\nsuch as agriculture and fisheries. \r\nIt would, of course, hardly be realistic to expect all 108 \r\nparticipants in the Uruguay Round to be equally satisfied with the \r\nresults. The essential point, however, is that a general agreement that \r\nall can live with is now within reach. As the Director-General of the \r\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Mr. Dunkel, recently \r\npointed out, \r\n\"the Uruguay Round is a single undertaking. The results are to be \r\nseen in an overall, integrated package. There is no pick and \r\nchoose\"-\r\nA reasonably satisfactory groundwork has been laid for the years ahead. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n86 \r\n(Mr. Hannibalsson. Iceland) \r\nThe future stability of world trade now hinges on two of the main \r\nplayers, the European Community and the United States. If they can reach \r\nagreement, the Uruguay Round will soon be concluded. If they do not, there \r\nare turbulent, even chaotic times ahead. Both players must shoulder their \r\nresponsibilities towards the rest of the world. The issues that remain \r\nunresolved are not of a nature to justify yet another postponement, which \r\nwould in fact mean the end of the Uruguay Round. \r\nWe cannot afford to let the Uruguay Round founder on the unjustified \r\nclaims of a rural minority for protection and subsidies. The contribution of \r\nagriculture to gross domestic product has dropped drastically in the developed \r\nworld, but support for and protection of agriculture has increased. \r\nFree-trade forces in manufacturing and services are more advanced than they \r\nare in agriculture, and it is noteworthy that in recent years subsidies to \r\nmanufacturing in the developed world have declined. \r\nAmong the most important commitments embodied in the United Nations \r\nCharter is the determination of our countries to promote social progress and \r\nbetter standards of living in conditions of greater freedom. But over the \r\nlast 10 years social conditions in a number of countries have actually \r\ndeclined. More than 1 billion people live in absolute poverty. What is \r\nneeded is for all nations represented in the Assembly to rise above their \r\ndisagreements and act together to relieve the plight of those living under \r\nconditions of abject misery. Iceland supports, therefore, the proposal to \r\nconvene a world summit for social development in 1995. \r\nThis year marks the end of the United Nations Decade of Disabled \r\nPersons. The implementation of the objectives of the World Programme of \r\nAction has, when all is said and done, been disappointing. We must respect \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n87 \r\n(Mr. Hannibalsson. Iceland) \r\nour pledges to the world\u0027s half billion persons with disabilities and recommit \r\nourselves to the objective of creating equal opportunities for all people. \r\nIn the past few years we have become increasingly aware of the \r\ninterrelationship between the state of the environment and advances in human \r\nrights and social development. As was already noted by that distinguished \r\nrepresentative of the best tradition of European humanism, Willy Brandt, \r\n12 years ago: \r\n\"It can no longer be argued that protection of the environment is an \r\nobstacle to development. On the contrary, the care of the natural \r\nenvironment is an essential aspect of development\". \r\nThe success of efforts to deal with global environmental problems and a \r\nlong-term strategy to achieve sustainable development will depend in large \r\npart on how we manage population growth. At the present growth rate the human \r\nrace is likely to double in less than half a century. Obviously, all nations, \r\nrich and poor alike, owe it to succeeding generations to cooperate in \r\nachieving a major revision of social policies in the field of population \r\ncontrol. \r\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de \r\nJaneiro was a landmark event, as was evidenced by the wide participation in \r\nthe Conference. Its achievements provide a sound basis for further work. In \r\norder to safeguard our planet from otherwise-inevitable ecological disaster, \r\nwe must agree on targets and measures that will lead us towards sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\nDuring the past year there have been no indications that the state of the \r\nglobal environment is improving or that we have managed to turn the tide. On \r\nthe contrary, findings earlier this year which show a further depletion of \r\nozone in the stratosphere are of great concern. Recent disclosures of massive \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n88 \r\n(Mr. Hannibalsson. Iceland) \r\ndischarges of radioactive waste and other hazardous materials into the Barents \r\nand Kara Seas from the former Soviet Union could also be an indication of an \r\necological time bomb. These and many similar dangers have made the Earth \r\nappear smaller than ever before and demonstrate the need for enhanced \r\ninternational cooperation and stronger national commitment to environmental \r\nprotection. \r\nTurning to the follow-up to the Rio Conference, Iceland considers the \r\nprevention of marine pollution, as well as efforts to ensure sustainable \r\nutilization of all marine living resources, to be of fundamental importance. \r\nThe oceans are not only a crucial part of the respiratory system of our planet \r\nbut also an indispensable source of food for mankind. The requirements of \r\nbasic human subsistence make it imperative that the living resources of the \r\nsea remain available for human consumption. Moreover, marine resources could \r\nbecome one of the most important assets of developing countries as they strive \r\nfor sustainable development. Iceland therefore particularly welcomes the \r\nunanimous decision taken at the Rio Conference to convene an international \r\nconference to address the prevention of marine pollution from land-based \r\nsources. \r\nAs pollution endangers our natural environment, so there are other \r\nnoxious influences which threaten to corrupt our societies from within. Drug \r\nabuse is a global problem which threatens the security and stability of many \r\ncountries and is a serious social problem in most countries of the world. The \r\ndrug problem is\u0027a multi-faceted one. We must continue to fight, with real \r\nsolutions which touch on all its facets, including ways to diminish demand, \r\nproduction and trafficking. Drug-trafficking is increasingly an organized \r\ncrime, victimizing mainly our youth. More effective leadership, based on a \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n89-90 \r\n(Mr. Hannibalsson. Iceland) \r\nmore definite mandate from the United Nations International Drug Control \r\nProgramme, is clearly called for. \r\nIn my opening words, I referred to a time of remarkable opportunities for \r\nthe United Nations. Before concluding, I feel it is appropriate to return to \r\nthose unique circumstances in the context of the tasks and challenges ahead. \r\nNow more than ever, the United Nations has the potential to become a more \r\ncredible and effective world Organization for the benefit of all humankind. \r\nBut the moment must be seized. There is a need to revamp the United Nations \r\nfrom within, to consolidate the Organization politically and concentrate on \r\nmore effective management. This is necessary, not least in order for the \r\nOrganization to regain and maintain the trust of its Member States. \r\nFurthermore, we must adapt the United Nations to the new demands posed by the \r\ngrowing number of Member States, the radical changes on the international scene \r\nand the growing interdependence of States since the Second World War. \r\nThe Secretary General\u0027s recent report entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\" \r\npoints the way. Let us be mindful of his observation that States Members of \r\nthe United Nations are fortunate in having been given a second chance to \r\ncreate the world envisioned in the Charter, a chance denied with painful \r\nconsequences the members of the League of Nations. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n91 \r\nADDRESS BY MR. OBED DLAMINI, PRIME MINISTER OF THE KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Swaziland. \r\nMr. Obed Dlamini. Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Swaziland, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have great pleasure in welcoming the Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Swaziland, Mr. Obed Dlamini, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\nMr. DLAMINI (Swaziland): May I begin, on behalf of His Majesty King \r\nMswati III, Her Majesty the Indlovukazi - the Queen Mother and the whole \r\nSwazi nation, by conveying to you all the greetings and good wishes of the \r\nKingdom of Swaziland. \r\nI offer my country\u0027s sincerest congratulations to Mr. Ganev on his \r\nwell-deserved election to the presidency of the United Nations General \r\nAssembly at this forty-seventh session. We are most confident in his ability \r\nto guide deliberations in this distinguished gathering towards successful \r\nconclusions. \r\nAllow me also to express Swaziland\u0027s gratitude to his predecessor, \r\nAmbassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, for his extremely effective \r\nleadership as President at the forty-sixth session, during which much valuable \r\nwork was conducted. \r\nOur thanks and admiration are also due to the members of the Bureau, \r\nwhose role in the day-to-day activities is central to the success of the \r\nAssembly. \r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express Swaziland\u0027s \r\nappreciation of the outstanding service given this Organization by the former \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, whose diplomatic experience \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n92 \r\n(Mr. Dlamini. Swaziland) \r\nand dynamic leadership contributed so much to the re-emergence of the United \r\nNations as the only international institution with the influence to improve \r\nsocial, economic and political standards throughout the world. \r\nOur contratulation, too, go to his successor, our new Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has already shown the experience, diplomacy and \r\nwisdom necessary to make a success of this most important and challenging post. \r\nWe wish him strength through God\u0027s held and blessing as he continues to \r\nlead us in these difficult times. \r\nThis year has seen the admission of new Member States, once again \r\ndemonstrating the principle of extending the advantages of membership to all \r\nwho desire to embrace our founding Charter. We welcome our new Members, and \r\nwe are confident that their presence will contribute substantially towards \r\nthis new age of international understanding and cooperation, as we strive to \r\nattain universal harmony. \r\nMany obstacles remain in the way of true international peace and \r\nstability but, as has been shown in the past, with the release of East-West \r\ntension and the subsequent removal of the atmosphere of fear and mistrust \r\nwhich had so clouded past deliberations, this forum remains our one hope in \r\nour search for acceptable solutions to the many challenges that confront us. \r\nAlthough the Kingdom of Swaziland remains, thankfully, peaceful and \r\nstable, it is a fact that, in these times of global interdependence, we are \r\nsubject to, and affected by, the pressures or events occurring outside our \r\nborders; not just in our own subregion but also by the tragedies and crises \r\noccurring throughout the world. \r\nThe role of the United Nations as the most powerful and influential body \r\nfor immediate humanitarian aid, and as the most acceptable international \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n93 \r\n(Mr. Dlamini. Swaziland) \r\nbroker for peace, continues to stretch our collective resources to the \r\nutmost. The priorities for our efforts become ever harder to define, as the \r\nincidence of disaster and conflict, with their corresponding calls on our \r\nresources, appear to increase. \r\nWe in Swaziland accept our responsibility, through our membership of the \r\nUnited Nations, to lend our support wherever the call for humanitarian aid, \r\nand assistance to end the bloodshed of a conflict, is made, regardless of our \r\ndirect or indirect involvement in those situations. \r\nOur regular and prompt payment of dues testifies to our commitment to \r\nthis policy, and we are proud of our record. \r\nThe various unresolved conflicts on our own continent are, of course, of \r\nprimary consideration to us, and of immediate concern is the situation \r\naffecting our neighbour. South Africa. \r\nWe have watched as the momentous changes of the last two years have \r\nbrought the inevitable ebb and flow of hope and despair. We have been \r\nconstant in our support of a peaceful process, through negotiation, towards \r\nthe establishment of a new South Africa whose guiding principles would be \r\nacceptable to all partners, and we have been reassured by the words and \r\nactions of the United Nations in its acceptance of that goal. \r\nWe have suffered along with the victims, many of Swazi origin, of the \r\nterrible violence that continues to plague the peace process; and we welcomed \r\nthe initiative of the United Nations in dispatching a team of observers, under \r\nthe capable leadership of the distinguished Special Envoy, Mr. Virendra Dayal, \r\nto assess the violence in the townships. We are confident that they will \r\nsuccessfully bring to bear their collective expertise and experience in \r\nhelping to resolve this most distressing problem. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n94-95 \r\n(Mr. Dlamini. Swaziland) \r\nSwaziland now urges all political leaders in South Africa to put aside \r\ntheir differences and to return to the negotiating table in a spirit of \r\ncompromise and conciliation for the sake of their country and for the future \r\nof their children. \r\nWe in southern Africa can only pray that there will be an early, peaceful \r\nconclusion of the process, so that we too can benefit from the advantages that \r\ncloser social and economic links with a new South Africa will inevitably bring \r\nus and the other countries of the subregion. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n96 \r\n(Mr. Dlamini. Swaziland) \r\nThe situation within the borders of our other neighbour, Mozambique, \r\noffers at last some ray of hope for an early resolution, and our support for \r\nthe processes of peace there seem finally to have been rewarded. Swaziland \r\n) \r\nwishes to express its deepest admiration and praise for all those involved in \r\nthe peace negotiations between FRELIMO and RENAMO, which resulted in the \r\nmomentous accord signed in Rome last month. In particular, the efforts of the \r\nGovernments of Italy, Portugal and the United States, and the individual \r\ncontribution of His Excellency President Robert Mugabe, deserve our applause. \r\nBut without the commitment of both sides of the dispute to peaceful \r\nsettlement, the assistance and advice of these international friends would \r\nhave been worthless. We salute the initiatives of both parties and entreat \r\nthem to carry through the undertakings of the accord without further bloodshed \r\nand with a determination to regain the peace which has so long been denied the \r\nMozambican people. \r\nThe crisis in Mozambique has a great and direct bearing on our own \r\nsituation. At least 80,000 Mozambican refugees currently enjoy Swazi \r\nhospitality at continuing great expense to our national economy in the \r\nform of resources in land, finance, employment opportunities and other social \u0027 \r\nservices. We, and indeed the refugees themselves, look forward to the \"* \r\nresumption of a secure and peaceful atmosphere in Mozambique so that :\u0027 \r\nrepatriation can reasonably take place and thus relieve the pressure of the \"\u003e \r\nsubstantial burden that is being carried by us. ^ \r\n\u003c 1 \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n97 \r\n(Mr. Dlamini. Swaziland) \r\nJust as we continue to rely on the efforts of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian agencies for help in coping \r\nwith these unfortunate victims, so we shall be looking for assistance when the \r\ntime comes for them to return home. We are confident that we, and the \r\nrefugees, deserve such aid. \r\nSwaziland welcomed the end of hostilities in Angola, and we would like to \r\nexpress our appreciation to those whose efforts brought the crisis to an end. \r\nWe now join the rest of the international community in praying for a \r\nsuccessful election process so that all Angolans will be able to reap the \r\nbenefits of peace. \r\nThe horrifying situation in Somalia continues to give us cause for grave \r\nconcern. The almost unbelievable proportions of the disastrous effects of \r\nfamine and the continuing interfactional fighting beg action on an \r\ninternational scale. We fully support all United Nations efforts to bring \r\nrelief to the starving, suffering millions. Words mean little in such \r\ncircumstances, but the people of Somalia should know that our prayers are with \r\nthem; with God\u0027s blessing and with positive assistance from us, they will pull \r\nthrough this dark episode in their country\u0027s history. \r\nThe situations in Chad, the Sudan and Liberia also give little cause for \r\nhope for early solutions. Again, we pledge our full support to all efforts to \r\nbring about peaceful and lasting solutions to these problems which affect the \r\nstability of our continent. \r\nIn Europe, too, the ravages and upheaval of war and social change have \r\nhad their devastating effect. The situation in former Yugoslavia in \r\nparticular gives immediate cause for concern, with the ongoing war in Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina and the crises of uncertainty in the other newly-independent \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n98 \r\n(Mr. Dlamini. Swaziland) \r\nStates. The efforts of the United Nations and the European Community to bring \r\nabout peace are to be applauded and they deserve our fullest support. We pray \r\nthat sense will prevail amongst the leaders of different factions and that use \r\nwill be made of the negotiating table in bringing about an early end to the \r\nhorrific bloodshed in this unfortunate corner of Europe. \r\nWe applaud the work of the United Nations Special Envoy, Mr. Cyrus Vance, \r\nand that of the European representative. Lord Owen, in their extremely \r\ndifficult task as intermediaries. The performance of the multinational \r\nmonitoring force, operating under the most frustrating and challenging \r\nconditions, is also in the best United Nations traditions and deserves our \r\nadmiration and praise. \r\nSwaziland has been watching with great interest, and not a little \r\noptimism, the developments over the last year in the Middle East. The \r\ndisputes and conflicts in this important area have for too long been the cause \r\nof international concern, and we welcome all efforts to bring about an \r\natmosphere in which all parties can resolve their differences. The Government \r\nof the United States of America, in particular, deserves mention in its \r\ndetermination to get the Middle East peace initiative up and running. \r\nMoreover, the latest conciliative remarks by His Excellency, the new Israeli \r\nPrime Minister, with the correspondingly constructive responses from the \r\naffected countries, give cause for encouragement that our prayers for positive \r\nsteps towards the achievement of lasting peace in the whole region may at last \r\nbe answered. Much, of course, remains to be done, but we can only support and \r\nencourage all initiatives towards the achievement of this aim. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n99 \r\n(Mr. Dlamini. Swaziland) \r\nSwaziland is distressed to hear of the latest disasters which have \r\nafflicted some areas of Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Philippines, the United \r\nStates of America and other countries in different parts of the world. The \r\ndisasters which have caused so many thousands of deaths and destroyed the \r\nhomes of millions constitute a crisis of unprecedented proportions. We join \r\nothers in the international community in pledging our moral support for \r\nimmediate substantial aid to relieve the suffering and to help rebuild the \r\nshattered economies of these areas. \r\nSwaziland joined the rest of the United Nations last year in welcoming \r\nthe two Koreas as Members of our Organization. The resolution of the crisis \r\nbetween these two countries has been on our agenda for a long time, and \r\nSwaziland welcomes and supports any initiative to bring about an atmosphere of \r\nconciliation and peace between them. \r\nWe call on the people of Afghanistan to use the present opportunity for \r\npeace to bury any divisive differences between them and to move on with the \r\ntask of national reconciliation and economic development so that all may enjoy \r\nthe hard-won fruits of peace. \r\nIn Cambodia, we have welcomed the efforts of our sizeable United Nations \r\npresence in assisting with the consolidation of positive trends towards peace \r\nand stability. We look forward to having a unified Cambodia add its \r\ninfluential support in the restoration of peace throughout the region of \r\nIndo-China. \r\nIn these and other conflicts around the world, the United Nations has \r\ndistinguished itself in trying to act as brokers for peace and as the provider \r\nof humanitarian aid. This has been achieved, often in the most hazardous and \r\ndifficult circumstances, but with an increasing rate of success and with the \r\nnoblest intentions of creating a safer, more stable world. To that end, the \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n100 \r\n(Mr. Dlamini. Swaziland) \r\ninitiatives towards limiting proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are \r\nof paramount importance in our efforts to bring about true international peace \r\nand harmony, and Swaziland gives these efforts its fullest support. \r\nThe pressing issue of the environment was important enough to attract all \r\nmembers of the United Nations family to the Earth summit in Brazil earlier \r\nthis year. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n101 \r\n(Mr. Dlamini. Swaziland) \r\nThe commitment shown there by all participants, and ratified by a number \r\nof far-reaching treaties, to address the multiple problems posed by man\u0027s \r\nthoughtlessness and ignorance was fully justified and was a timely reminder of \r\nhow much irreparable damage we have already caused. For us in Swaziland, the \r\nSummit served as a catalyst in our efforts to become more aware of our \r\nenvironmental responsibilities, and we are now taking those responsibilities \r\nvery seriously indeed. In fact, no greater reminder of our own reliance on \r\nour natural resources was needed, as we found ourselves in the middle of the \r\nworst drought on record. \r\nIt is ironic that, as we strive as a nation to develop along the right \r\npaths and as our economic base becomes more and more dependent on increasingly \r\nsophisticated industrial development, it takes the failure of a basic natural \r\nresource to make us realize how complete our reliance still is on the basic \r\ngifts of nature and how carefully we must nurture our country\u0027s precious \r\nresources to ensure that future generations inherit a fruitful and productive \r\nland. \r\nWe are indebted to the United Nations for its prompt response in \r\nconvening the successful pledging conference in Geneva in June to benefit \r\nthose who have been hardest hit by the drought, and our gratitude is also due \r\nthose in the international community that responded so generously. \r\nBut a short-term response is not enough. We in the region have \r\nrecognized that our emphasis must now be on ensuring that we are adequately \r\nprepared for any such natural disaster in the future. We shall be looking to \r\nthe Organization for advice and assistance so that our people may never again \r\nsuffer as they have this past season. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n102 \r\n(Mr. Dlamini. Swaziland) \r\nOne principle to which Swaziland is attaching increasing importance is \r\nthe linkage of our nation\u0027s development, both social and economic, to a \r\ndependence on closer cooperation with our regional partners. Social \r\ndevelopment is inextricably linked to economic performance, and the \r\neradication of many of our national social problems, such as poverty, \r\nunemployment, crime and the like, depends on improvement in our economic \r\nsituation. \r\nOur membership in such regional organizations as the Preferential Trade \r\nArea Authority and the Southern African Development Coordination Conference \r\nand the Treaty signed recently at the Organization of African Unity (OAU) \r\nsummit in Abuja, establishing the African Economic Community, point out our \r\nstrong commitment to improving our economic performance through closer \r\neconomic and trade cooperation with the rest of our continent. Those \r\norganizations and initiatives are serious attempts by Africans, for the \r\nbenefit of Africa, to pull themselves out of the economic and social quagmire \r\nof recent years. We deserve and expect the support, encouragement and \r\npositive assistance of the international community if we are to make a success \r\nof it and thereby reduce future dependence on the developed world. \r\nAfrica is disturbed to see much-needed developmental funds being diverted \r\nto other targets, and while Swaziland, for one, is making every effort to \r\nprepare itself to stand on its own, our country and others in our subregion \r\nare still in desperate need of continuing assistance in many areas, precisely \r\nso that we shall be able to establish the mechanisms and organizations that \r\nwill allow Africa to be self-sufficient in the future. \r\nSwaziland hopes and prays that Africa will not be neglected now at a time \r\nwhen assistance is most needed. That fact has been driven forcefully home to \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n103 \r\n(Mr. Dlamini. Swaziland) \r\nus with the production of the latest World Economic Survey, which, as is \r\ninevitable in the midst of an international economic recession, has once more \r\npainted a miserable picture for developing countries. For Africa, in \r\nparticular, the litany of depressing economic news makes for distressing \r\nreading. \r\nOne area of particular concern to us as we strive to become less \r\ndependent on the developed world is the widening gap between North and South, \r\nbetween the primary-commodity producers and the manufacturers of finished \r\nproducts, a situation exacerbated by the protectionist trade policies employed \r\nby some and by the inability to bring to a successful conclusion, so far, the \r\nUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. \r\nThose are some of the areas which inhibit the release of the developing \r\nworld from the chains of dependence on the developed countries. We appeal to \r\nall to address these problems in the only way that will produce results: in \r\nthe spirit of true international brotherhood within this family of nations. \r\nOur Organization has much to be proud of and much still left to do. The \r\nUnited Nations remains the only truly global forum in which the world\u0027s \r\nproblems can be discussed and from which the collective experience and \r\nexpertise of all our Member nations can be pooled to find solutions. \r\nSwaziland is proud to count itself one among this illustrious company and, on \r\nbehalf of His Majesty King Mswati III, Her Majesty the Indlovukazi and the \r\nwhole Swazi nation, I have the honour of once more reaffirming my Kingdom\u0027s \r\ncommitment to the guiding principles enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations. \r\nMay almighty God watch over the deliberations of the Assembly and reward \r\nit with the success it deserves. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n104-105 \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Swaziland for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\nMr. Obed Dlamini. Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Swaziland, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\nMr. POOS (Luxembourg) (interpretation from French): At the outset I \r\nshould like to convey to the President of the General Assembly my heartiest \r\ncongratulations on his unanimous election. He is one of the principal \r\narchitects of the advent of democracy and profound change in Bulgaria. I am \r\ncertain he will guide with skill and efficacy the work of the General \r\nAssembly, which I hope will carry on resolutely in the reform of its programme \r\nand its working methods. \r\nTo our new Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, I should like to \r\nexpress the great pleasure of the Government and people of Luxembourg on his \r\nelection to head our Organization. The decisions he has taken and the \r\nproposals he has put forward since the beginning of the year make it fitting \r\nfor me to pay tribute to him for his lucidity, courage and resolve to make of \r\nthe United Nations an organization that is capable of answering the challenges \r\nof our time. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n106 \r\n(Mr. Poos. Luxembourg) \r\nI welcome the representatives of the 13 new countries that have joined \r\nthe United Nations since the beginning of this year, bringing the number of \r\nMembers to 179. \r\nLast Tuesday my colleague Douglas Hurd put forward the positions of the \r\ntwelve member States of the European Community concerning the major problems \r\nthat confront the international community at present. Clearly, I subscribe to \r\neverything that was said by the representative of the State which occupies the \r\npresidency of the Council of Ministers of the European Community, so I shall \r\nlimit myself to stressing several issues that are of particular concern to the \r\nGovernment and people of Luxembourg. \r\nTwo tragedies giving rise to the utmost concern are occurring at \r\npresent. I refer to the famine in certain parts of Africa and to the civil \r\nwar in Yugoslavia. Both of these show once again that the international \r\ncommunity\u0027s right to humanitarian interference in regional conflicts can no \r\nlonger be called into question. \r\nThe famine in Africa threatens the lives of an extraordinarily large \r\nnumber of human beings, and it must immediately be at the focus of our \r\nattention. We are confronted, on one hand, by an overwhelming drought, that \r\nhas afflicted all of eastern and southern Africa and, on the other hand, by \r\nthe lack of organization in the production and distribution of foodstuffs,that \r\nhas resulted from civil wars. \r\nIn the Sudan and in Somalia, the European Community has continued, over \r\nthe last few months, to intervene with the parties involved to ensure that \r\nthose parties will allow and guarantee the distribution of international food \r\naid. It is indeed outrageous that a government or armed factions should \r\ninterfere with this operation. I am glad that our Organization has sent \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n107 \r\n(Mr. Poos. Luxembourg) \r\nmilitary forces to Somalia to guarantee food distribution. My country is \r\ncontributing to all these efforts by providing financial assistance which, per \r\ncapita, is among the greatest in the world. We believe that the United \r\nNations should consider what measures it might undertake to ensure that famine \r\nis no longer used as a weapon in the civil war raging in the Sudan. \r\nThe continuing tragedy in Yugoslavia is of the most profound concern to \r\nthe people of my country. Unfortunately we are witnessing a resurgence of \r\nmost of the criminal practices of nazism, including even the horrendous \r\n\"ethnic purification\" applied to persons from a different sociological group. \r\nThe problems raised by the presence of minority populations in the republics \r\nof the former Yugoslavia cannot be resolved by military intervention; they can \r\nbe resolved only through negotiated arrangements modelled on those proposed in \r\nNovember 1991 by the European Community. \r\nI make a solemn appeal to all the peoples of the former Yugoslavia to \r\nsupport energetically the efforts of those leaders who wish, fully, \r\nunreservedly and without any hidden agenda, to implement the measures defined \r\nat the London Conference on 26 and 27 August. Only in that way can peace and \r\nprosperity be re-established. Only on that basis can an equitable solution be \r\nfound to the problem of nationalities or minorities the problem that gave \r\nrise to this conflict, just as it was at the basis of the bloodshed which, \r\nunfortunately, continues in certain areas of the former Soviet Union. \r\nWith regard to this extremely complex problem, I should like to make some \r\nfurther observations. As the representative of a small country that owes its \r\nexistence to the principle of self-determination, I am clearly not in a good \r\nposition to deny this right to other peoples. However, I must make the point \r\nthat, where several types of population are closely linked, the application of \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n108 \r\n(Mr. Poos. Luxembourg) \r\nthis principle is not sufficient to resolve the problem of nationalities As \r\nwe have seen, it can serve as a pretext for attempts at conquest and at the \r\nannexation of territory, as well as at the forcible expulsion of minority \r\npopulations, and even the extermination of such peoples. \r\nThe solution to the problem of minorities can be based only on the \r\nfollowing principles: rejection of the idea that frontiers can be changed by \r\nforce; the granting to national minorities of special status ensuring respect \r\nfor their ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identities; the adoption \r\nof arrangements for cross-border cooperation to enable these minorities to \r\nmaintain close contact with their compatriots in neighbouring countries. In \r\nthis respect, it seems to us that Italy\u0027s solution for the Haut Adige/South \r\nTyrol is exemplary. \r\nThe establishment, by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope, of the machinery of rapporteurs for human rights, as well as the post \r\nof commissioner for minorities, should make possible the early identification \r\nof potential nationality conflicts and the search for means of prevention. \r\nIt seems to me that the world conference on human rights to be held next \r\nyear in Vienna could provide the appropriate framework for an attempt to \r\ndefine certain fundamental rights of minorities and, if possible, to codify \r\nthem in a new legal instrument. If it were possible, in addition, to \r\nestablish machinery for an independent forum to verify, at the request of a \r\nwide group of people, respect for these minimum rights through the legislation \r\nof a given country, that would help to avoid armed conflicts in the future. \r\nIn the last analysis, the problem of minorities can be resolved only if \r\nall peoples living in a territory can be made to feel that they belong to one \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n109-110 \r\n(Mr. Poos. Luxembourg) \r\nfamily so that they put emphasis on that which unites them rather than on that \r\nwhich divides them. It was united action rather than division that enabled \r\nthe European Community to secure a new instrument the Maastricht Treaty \r\nfor the purpose of pursuing their policy of integration, but with respect for \r\nnational identities. In this regard, I should like to welcome the decisive \r\nstep that the people of France took by saying \"Yes\" to the Maastricht Treaty, \r\nwhich my country ratified two months ago. \r\nLuxembourg has always been in the vanguard of European integration. From \r\nexperience it knows that the key to its wellbeing and its security lie in the \r\nCommunity and that only together with its partners can it exercise its \r\nsovereignty fully. \r\nWith regard to the problems of the Middle East, we are very gratified at \r\nthe more conciliatory spirit motivating the new Government of Israel, at the \r\ngestures that have already been made by that Government, and at the \r\nwillingness expressed by the Syrian authorities to conclude a peace \r\nagreement. It must be understood, of course, that negotiations for the \r\nestablishment of an interim regime in the occupied territories can in no case \r\ncome up with a result short of the Camp David Accords. \r\nWith regard to Iraq, we continue to demand that the existing regime \r\nimplement all Security Council resolutions as rapidly as possible. The Iraqi \r\nGovernment bears full responsibility for the deterioration of the humanitarian \r\nsituation in particular, because it has not yet implemented resolutions \r\n706 (1991) and 712 (1991). Iraq must cease all military action and all other \r\nrepressive measures against the civilian population. \r\nA/47/PV. 13 \r\n111 \r\n(Mr. Poos. Luxembourg) \r\nIn South Africa, the halt of the work of the Convention for a \r\nDemocratic South Africa (CODESA) has been most disappointing for my \r\nGovernment. Together with our European partners, we call on all the \r\nparties concerned to resume it as soon as possible in a constructive \r\nspirit. The problem of violence can be solved only if the police show \r\nrestraint and if all political movements give categorical instructions to \r\ntheir members definitively to renounce the use of force. I congratulate \r\nthe Security Council on its resolution 772 (1992) of 17 August, which \r\nallowed for the sending to South Africa of a number limited, it is \r\ntrue of United Nations observers to examine ways to strengthen the \r\nmachinery for the transition towards a non-racial democracy. \r\nI must obviously express our views concerning the work now going on \r\nwithin the United Nations. \r\nFirst, I should like to express to our Secretary-General my full \r\nappreciation of his excellent report entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\" \r\n(A/47/277), which he presented at the beginning of the summer. It \r\ncontains important proposals on preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and \r\npeace-keeping. The new international political situation is favourable \r\nfor stronger United Nations action, which I hope to see, particularly in \r\nthe following three areas. \r\nThe first is preventive diplomacy, which would assist us in \r\nanticipating and avoiding the outbreak of new conflicts. Would it not \r\nhelp the proper management of international affairs to ensure more active \r\nand systematic use of the various means for such diplomacy? The \r\nSecretary-General has a crucial role to play in this respect. We could \r\nalso make better use of the potential of the International Court of \r\nJustice to resolve disputes between States. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n112 \r\n(Mr. Poos. Luxembourg) \r\nThe second area is that of the make-up and functioning of a genuine \r\nsystem of collective security. The United Nations must be in a position \r\nwhen necessary to act very quickly, especially in cases of aggression or \r\nthreats of aggression by one country towards another. To do this it must \r\nhave available at very short notice the necessary human and material \r\nresources. Certain countries I mention in passing, France and the \r\nUnited States - have already responded very positively to the invitation \r\nin this regard by our Secretary-General. \r\nThe third area is that of the means for establishing peace. \r\nUnfortunately, all too often the diplomatic action of our Organization, \r\nsometimes in cooperation with regional organizations, such as the European \r\nCommunity, is not followed up. Too many cease-fires have been broken \r\nrecently, too many embargoes on the delivery of weapons have been \r\nviolated, for us to remain indifferent to such flouting of international \r\nlaw. \r\nNever before has the United Nations made so many tangible \r\ncontributions to the cause of peace and reconciliation throughout the \r\nworld. Nothing emphasizes the new credibility and effectiveness of our \r\nOrganization more than the dramatic increase in its peace-keeping \r\noperations in recent years. Thirteen such operations were carried out \r\nbefore 1987. Thirteen have been launched since 1987. The United Nations \r\nis now ensuring the implementation of peace agreements in El Salvador, \r\nAngola and Cambodia. It is contributing to calming the serious conflicts \r\nin Somalia and Yugoslavia. At present in Cambodia and Yugoslavia the \r\nUnited Nations is carrying out two of the most important operations in its \r\nhistory, involving a total of more than 40,000 personnel, both military \r\nand civilian. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n113 \r\n(Mr. Poos. Luxembourg) \r\nThe growing diversity of the tasks entrusted to our Organization \r\nhighlights its ability to adapt to different situations. Today the United \r\nNations is disarming adversaries and gathering and destroying weapons; \r\nreforming governmental institutions which are not up to their tasks; \r\nrepatriating refugees; clearing mines; monitoring elections and respect \r\nfor peace agreements and human rights agreements; and providing \r\nhumanitarian assistance and aid to refugees. \r\nIt is an honour for my Government to be able to contribute to the \r\nUnited Nations Protection Force in Yugoslavia, admittedly modest in \r\nabsolute numbers, but nevertheless representing 10 per cent of my \r\ncountry\u0027s army. \r\nThe cost of peace-keeping operations has considerably increased, and \r\ntheir importance demands that there be not the slightest delay in \r\npayment. The United Nations must be in a position to prepare, launch and \r\ncarry out such operations on a sound financial basis. The establishment \r\nof a revolving reserve fund would substantially strengthen that basis. \r\nMeanwhile, all countries must agree to meet their financial obligations \r\nwithout delay. \r\nAt its last session our Assembly adopted a resolution (resolution \r\n46/36 L) concerning the establishment by the United Nations of a universal \r\nand non-discriminatory Register of Conventional Arms. Luxembourg hopes \r\nthat during this session the technical procedures required can be \r\ndetermined and that the Register will become operational by the beginning \r\nof next year. The United Nations will thus be making an important \r\ncontribution to the necessary global transparency in arms transfers and to \r\nthe vast disarmament movement, which must continue. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n114 \r\n(Mr. Poos. Luxembourg) \r\nI welcome the agreement reached last June between President Bush and \r\nPresident Yeltsin concerning a drastic new reduction in strategic nuclear \r\narsenals. The forthcoming conclusion of negotiations concerning a \r\nConvention on chemical weapons marks a fundamental step in the \r\ninternational effort to eliminate all weapons of mass destruction. I hope \r\nthat all members of our Assembly will approve the Convention without \r\nreservation and will immediately sign it. \r\nOur Assembly has recorded significant progress on the basis of \r\nanother initiative of the European Community. This relates to the \r\nmeasures decided on to strengthen United Nations coordination in the area \r\nof emergency humanitarian assistance. The creation of the post of \r\nEmergency Relief Coordinator, to which Mr. Jan Eliasson was appointed, and \r\nthe establishment of a central revolving fund of $50 million now enable \r\nthe United Nations to cope more effectively with humanitarian crises. \r\nLuxembourg welcomes the broad democratization movement developing \r\nthroughout the world. It involves political changes which are often \r\npainful, complex and difficult, but they are necessary in order to build a \r\nbetter future. A growing number of Governments involved in such processes \r\nare requesting electoral assistance from the United Nations. Given the \r\nparticular importance of free and honest elections, I believe the United \r\nNations should continue to strengthen its capacity for acting in this \r\narea. I alsq propose that the United Nations cooperate with other \r\ninternational organizations with experience in this field in particular, \r\nthe Council of Europe. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n115 \r\n(Mr. Poos. Luxembourg) \r\nMy Government believes that the United Nations Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development, held in Rio, was a historic event. It is \r\ntrue that not all our hopes were fulfilled and that many of the decisions \r\ntaken lack clarity and courage. But who could deny the importance of the \r\npreparatory work and the awareness which it brought about? A world-wide \r\nprocess was launched. Major political commitments were made at the \r\nhighest level. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n116 \r\n(Mr. Poos. Luxembourg) \r\nHowever, the real battle still lies ahead. The convention on climate \r\nchange and the convention on biological diversity still must be ratified and \r\nimplemented; above all, they must be finalized and finely honed. The \r\nnegotiation of a convention on desertification still remains to be dealt with, \r\nand international cooperation on the protection of all forests- which is \r\nessential is still undefined. \r\nAgenda 21 opens up a vast field of work in all areas of the environment \r\nand development. Progress needs to be made in this respect on the national, \r\nregional and international levels, with the participation of all players in \r\nsociety and in particular of non-governmental organizations. \r\nPoor countries must accept the fact that environmental protection is not \r\na luxury; and rich countries must ask themselves if and to what extent their \r\nmeans of production and consumption are compatible with the demands of \r\nsustainable development. \r\nThe future of the planet cannot be jeopardized by national egoism. \r\nMy Government has decided to increase substantially the amount of aid \r\nearmarked for humanitarian assistance and development cooperation. It is \r\nprepared to work together with all those who are interested in promoting human \r\ndevelopment; transparent and honest management of public affairs; the \r\nparticipation of all, and above all of women, in the development process; \r\nand,in a general sense, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. \r\nThe tasks.before our Organization are numerous and most significant. A \r\nmajor process of transformation and restructuring lies ahead. Three years \r\nfrom now, we shall be marking the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. \r\nLet us hope that by that time we shall have established a revitalized \r\nOrganization, one that can effectively shoulder the responsibilities that the \r\npeoples of the world are so eager to entrust to it. \r\nA/47/PV. 13 \r\n117 \r\nMr. MOCUMBI (Mozambique): On behalf of my Government, I should like \r\nto congratulate Mr. Ganev upon his unanimous election to preside over the \r\ndeliberations of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. I am \r\nconfident that his diplomatic skills and statesmanship will bring additional \r\nimpetus to our work and contribute to the success of our current deliberations. \r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation \r\nfor the manner in which his predecessor. His Excellency Ambassador Shihabi of \r\nSaudi Arabia, stewarded the last session of the General Assembly. \r\nMy Government wishes to pay special tribute to the Secretary-General of \r\nthe United Nations, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his \r\ncommitment and tireless dedication to the ideals of the Organization. Though \r\nhe has been in office less than one year, he has demonstrated great political \r\nability and diplomatic skills in dealing with a wide range of delicate tasks \r\naround the globe. The Secretary-General\u0027s superior judgement and his ability \r\nto understand better the fragile nature of the emerging problems of today\u0027s \r\nworld have won him high respect, confidence and admiration in the \r\ninternational arena. We pledge to him our continued full support. \r\nMay I also avail myself of this opportunity to extend our most fraternal \r\nfelicitations to the newly admitted Members of the United Nations. Their \r\npresence among us today reinforces our common objective to make the United \r\nNations a universal instrument of peace, understanding and cooperation among \r\nnations. \r\nThe current session of the General Assembly takes place against a \r\nbackdrop of continued and ever-growing changes in international relations. We \r\nare witnessing a new political reality where the super-Powers\u0027 confrontation \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n118 \r\n(Mr. Mocumbi. Mozambique) \r\nand rivalry, in their numerous manifestations, have ceased to threaten our \r\nfragile world, a world in which an arms race between two competing blocs is no \r\nlonger the main concern in the daily life of nations. A new political reality \r\nin which the problems resulting from the division of the world into spheres of \r\ninfluence, which had characterized international relations since the birth of \r\nthis Organization, has now given rise to new hope in the search for conflict \r\nresolution. \r\nHowever, this new political reality brings new challenges. Although the \r\ndanger of nuclear war has diminished drastically, the gap between rich and \r\npoor nations continues to widen. Uncertainty about the future continues to \r\nworry many nations and peoples; the proliferation of regional conflicts \r\ncontinues unabated and shows the fragility of the new political landscape. \r\nMoreover, the international economic environment remains extremely \r\nunfavourable to developing countries. We are still faced with the \r\nincommensurable problems of debt burden, deterioration of commodity prices, \r\ninsufficient flow of financial resources and inadequate transfer of \r\ntechnology. The Uruguay Round negotiations are deadlocked, thus further \r\nexacerbating economic uncertainty worldwide. \r\nAs a result, today more and more nations see the United Nations as the \r\nprimary instrument for the promotion of international peace and security and \r\nof development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. This is \r\nillustrated by the growing number of countries that have turned to the United \r\nNations and received assistance in their quest for democratization and their \r\ndesire to strengthen respect for human rights in their respective territories. \r\nWe strongly believe that the end of the cold war and of rivalry and \r\nbipolarity should serve as a catalyst for the promotion of international \r\npolitical, economic and social stability. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n119-120 \r\n(Mr. Mocumbi. Mozambique) \r\nThe tremendous resources, both human and material, that for over 40 years \r\nhave been devoted to the purposes of self-destruction can and must now be used \r\nfor peaceful purposes and economic development. History has proved that it is \r\nmuch easier and less costly to work for peace than it is for war. The \r\nproblems ahead are still considerable, but they can be tackled and dealt with \r\nprovided that there is commitment to the purposes and principles of the United \r\nNations Charter at the highest political level. \r\nIn these endeavours, the United Nations should be entrusted with renewed \r\nresponsibilities in redirecting the use of available resources, in building \r\nconfidence and trust among nations and in allocating further resources for \r\npeace-keeping, peacemaking and peace-building. \r\nIt is high time for the international community to redouble its joint \r\nefforts in order to tackle with determination existing long-term problems and \r\nmake the world safer for all. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n121 \r\n(Mr. Mocumbi. Mozambique) \r\nWe live in a world full of diversity but also of similarity among \r\npeoples. While in the North man has made significant progress in mastering \r\nseemingly intractable natural phenomena and advanced sciences, such as genetic \r\nengineering, biochemistry and physics, in the South man still remains the \r\nvictim of illiteracy and backwardness and depends on the will of mother \r\nnature. There are further examples which reveal our common identity as human \r\nbeings - the inability to control our instincts and to manage and exercise \r\npower in a responsible manner. \r\nIt is within this context that we are assembled here today as \r\nrepresentatives of our peoples and nations in order to reflect on how to \r\nreverse the events that made it possible to devote more than $20 trillion \r\nduring the past 30 years to military expenditures, to the detriment of the \r\nfundamental concerns of all mankind. In our view the root causes of the \r\nenormous problems we face today lie essentially in the utilization of the \r\ndestructive capacity of man and not in the positive use of his extraordinary \r\ncreativity. \r\nAs has been well documented, we are currently living in a world where \r\nmore than 1 billion people, or nearly one fifth of the world\u0027s population, are \r\nestimated to live in poverty. More than half of these people are believed to \r\nlive below internationally accepted minimum living standards. This state of \r\naffairs has made the situation in developing countries, particularly in \r\nAfrica, even more dramatic. \r\nWe hope that the ending of the cold war and the confrontation between \r\nconflicting political systems will allow the international community to work \r\ntogether in the search for common solutions to the international problems \r\nfacing us today. \r\n\\ _ \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n122 \r\n(Mr. Mocumbi. Mozambique) \r\nWe come from southern Africa, a region struggling to build and reaffirm \r\nits political, economic and social identity. For many years now the peoples \r\nof the region have made tremendous sacrifices and gone through tremendous \r\nhardships in order to address the difficult problems facing the region, \r\nproblems of self-determination, decolonization, destabilization and war. We \r\nhave made tangible progress in this regard. Nevertheless, much more remains \r\nto be done and additional sacrifice will be required. \r\nIn this connection my delegation is particularly concerned about the \r\nrecurrence of violence in South Africa. The recent waves of violence in South \r\nAfrica, in particular the massacres of innocent civilians in Boipatong last \r\nJune and in Ciskei early this month, constitute a serious setback to the \r\nongoing efforts aimed at creating a climate conducive to a negotiated \r\nsettlement. \r\nWe trust that with the support of the international community the people \r\nof South Africa can find common ground for a solution to the problems \r\noriginating from the policies of institutionalized racial segregation. My \r\nGovernment welcomes the current efforts aimed at bringing about a resumption \r\nof talks leading towards a political settlement of the conflict in that \r\ncountry. \r\nWe pay special tribute to the manner in which the international community \r\nas a whole, and the United Nations in particular, has promptly responded to \r\nthe issue of violence in South Africa. We welcome the recent adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 765 (1992). We wish to encourage the \r\nSecretary-General to continue to work towards the implementation of that \r\nresolution and to help avert the current deadlock in the negotiating process. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n123 \r\n(Mr. Mocumbi. Mozambique) \r\nWe also urge all peace-loving forces in South Africa to join ranks and \r\nwork together in order to find a political settlement to the problems that \r\nhave resulted from nearly 50 years of apartheid, so as to ensure a smooth \r\ntransition to a democratic, non-racial and united South Africa. \r\nWe congratulate the Angolan people on their success in maintaining the \r\ncease-fire and in creating conditions for the holding of the first multiparty \r\nelections. It is our hope that the international community will continue to \r\nassist Angola and ensure that the elections on 29 and 30 September are held in \r\na climate of tranquillity so that the Angolan people can freely choose their \r\nrepresentatives. \r\nThe southern African region has been stricken by an unprecedented drought \r\nwith no parallel in living memory. This dramatic situation has already \r\nresulted in the destruction of this year\u0027s crops and in the devastation of the \r\nfauna and flora in large areas of the region. Important rivers have been \r\nreduced to almost a trickle of water, or even to large areas of dry sand. As \r\na result about 20 million human lives are seriously affected; the entire \r\nregion is threatened with the spectre of famine and deprivation. Last June a \r\njoint emergency appeal for relief and other emergency assistance was launched \r\nby the United Nations and the Southern African Development Co-ordination \r\nConference (SADCC). We seize this occasion to thank the international \r\ncommunity for its prompt response to the appeal, without which the human \r\nconsequences of this natural calamity would have been dramatic today. We \r\nreiterate our appeal for increased and urgent assistance in order fully to \r\nmeet the needs of the joint emergency appeal. \r\nIn spite of the number of difficulties facing our peoples in southern \r\nAfrica, joint efforts are under way with a view to revitalizing the economic \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n124 \r\n(Mr. Mocumbi. Mozambique) \r\nand social fabric of the region. It was within this framework and with the \r\naim of strengthening regional cooperation that we decided to establish the \r\nSouthern Africa Development Community (SADC). The newly born Community is a \r\nresult of 12 years of experience of fruitful cooperation within the Southern \r\nAfrican Development Co-ordination Conference. The new Community bears \r\ntestimony to the common willingness of the States of the region to have a \r\ngradual and balanced economic integration, based on the utilization of \r\nregional resources without, however, neglecting necessary external cooperation \r\nas a complementary factor in the prosecution of our objectives. We therefore \r\ncall upon the international community to continue to extend its support in \r\norder to help the peoples of the southern African region to address the \r\ncombined effects of man-made disasters and natural calamities, especially the \r\nprolonged drought. \r\nIn this respect, the case of Mozambique is particularly grave as war has \r\nbeen ravaging the country for 16 years. The economic cost of this horrendous \r\nwar, which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and resulted in the \r\ndestruction of property and the economic and social infrastructure, has been \r\nestimated to be about $20 billion. \r\nThe Assembly will recall that in order to find a political settlement to \r\nthe conflict in Mozambique, and taking into consideration the highest \r\ninterests of the nation, direct negotiations between the Government and RENAMO \r\nhave been under way for two years now under the mediation of the Italian \r\nGovernment, the Santo Egidio Community and the Catholic Church of Mozambique. \r\nSince last June the United Nations, France, Portugal, the United Kingdom and \r\nthe United States of America have been participating as observers in the peace \r\nprocess. We believe their contribution, together with that of other \r\nParticipants in the peace process, has brought new impetus to the process as \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n125 \r\n(Mr. Mocumbi. Mozambique) \r\nillustrated inter alia by the signing of the Declaration on the guiding \r\nprinciples to facilitate the distribution of humanitarian aid in the country. \r\nThe ongoing peace process in Rome has been complemented by other \r\nimportant high-level initiatives at the regional level. These initiatives \r\nculminated in the convening of a high-level meeting on 7 August in Rome \r\nbetween His Excellency President Chissano and the RENAMO leader. The \r\nhigh-level meeting resulted in the signing of a Joint Declaration. The \r\ndocument contains the solemn commitment by the Government of Mozambique and \r\nRENAMO to work for the completion and approval by 1 October 1992 of all \r\noutstanding issues in order to make possible the signing of the general peace \r\nagreement and to bring about an immediate cessation of hostilities by that \r\ndate. \r\nThe Joint Declaration outlines general principles and specific guarantees \r\npertaining to the attainment of peace, democracy and national unity based on \r\nthe overall goal of national reconciliation. It binds both sides to \r\nguaranteeing conditions allowing complete political freedom in accordance with \r\ninternationally recognized democratic principles, as well as personal security \r\nfor all citizens of Mozambique and all members of political parties. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n126 \r\n(Mr. Mocumbi. Mozambique) \r\nThe Joint Declaration further stresses the need to honour the principles \r\ncontained in Protocol No. I, calling upon the Government of Mozambique \r\n\"not to act in a way that is contrary to the terms of the Protocols that \r\nare established, not to adopt laws or measures and not to apply current \r\nlaws that may eventually be contrary to these Protocols\". \r\n(S/24406. annex, p. 4. para, (iv)) \r\nThe Declaration also requires that \r\n\"RENAMO undertakes not to combat by force of arms after the entry into \r\nforce of a cease-fire, but to conduct its political struggle observing \r\ncurrent laws, within the framework of the existing State institutions, \r\nand respecting the conditions and the guarantees laid down in the General \r\nPeace Agreement\" (ibid.) \r\nThe Joint Declaration underlines the role of the international community, \r\nin particular the United Nations, in monitoring the implementation of the \r\nGeneral Peace Agreement and the cease-fire and the conduct of the electoral \r\nprocess. \r\nMy Government has solemnly declared its readiness to abide by the \r\nprovisions of the Joint Declaration and to work towards peace and tranquillity \r\nin our country. Even as I address the General Assembly, the Assembly of the \r\nRepublic, the parliament of Mozambique, is in session in order to legislate on \r\nall the issues pertaining to the implementation of the Declaration. \r\nMore recently, on 18 September, the Head of State of Mozambique and the \r\nRENAMO leader met once again in Gaborone, Botswana, in order to address the \r\nissues on the agenda of the Rome negotiations which caused a deadlock. The \r\nmeeting reaffirmed 1 October as the deadline for the signing of the General \r\nPeace Agreement in Mozambique and an agreed solution was found to those issues. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n127 \r\n(Mr. Mocumbi. Mozambique) \r\nNever before in the history of this conflict have peace and conciliation \r\namongst all Mozambicans been so close. We therefore believe that RENAMO must \r\nshare the historical responsibility in order to respond to the hopes of our \r\npeople and turn 1 October into a historic landmark in the annals of Mozambican \r\nhistory. \r\nThe Government of Mozambique is fully prepared to open a new chapter in \r\nour history, a chapter characterized by an atmosphere of tolerance, \r\nreconciliation and understanding among all Mozambicans. My Government long \r\nago stated that there was no justification whatsoever for the continuation of \r\nwar in Mozambique. In this connection, it should be recalled that since the \r\ncoming into force of the new Constitution, in November 1990, more than 10 \r\npolitical parties have emerged and have been performing freely and peacefully \r\ntheir political activities in Mozambique. We continue to believe that all \r\npolitical forces inside the country should pursue their political objectives \r\nthrough democratically accepted norms of conduct, without resorting to \r\nviolence. \r\nFrom this rostrum, I wish to commend the Secretary-General\u0027s personal \r\ncommitment to peace in my country. We are particularly gratified to note that \r\nthe United Nations stands ready to assist my country in this time of need. We \r\nalso commend the Secretary-General for his recent initiative to dispatch a \r\ntechnical team of civilian and military experts in order to assess the needs \r\nof the country during the implementation of the General Peace Agreement, in \r\nparticular the monitoring of the cease-fire and electoral process. We look \r\nforward to seeing the United Nations further involved in the peace efforts in \r\nMozambique in the days to come. \r\nFollowing the signing of the General Peace Agreement, the people of \r\nMozambique will need massive international assistance in addressing vital \r\n\\_ \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n128 \r\n(Mr. Mocumbi. Mozambique) \r\nissues, such as the implementation and monitoring of the cease-fire, the \r\norganization and supervision of the electoral process, demobilization of both \r\narmies and the reintegration of former soldiers into civilian life, creation \r\nof the new national army, the repatriation and resettlement of refugees from \r\nneighbouring countries and assistance to displaced persons. \r\nMost important, however, it will be crucial to assist Mozambique in its \r\nnational reconstruction efforts and ensure the non-recurrence of violence and \r\ndestruction in the country. Such assistance will call for the creation, \r\nexpansion and strengthening of democratic institutions and the maintenance of \r\nlaw and order, so as to deal with the growing challenges facing the nation \r\nunder conditions of multi-party democracy. \r\nIn Rome the Government delegation and RENAMO agreed that in order \r\ncomprehensively to address the political, economic and social situation in \r\nMozambique the convening of a donor conference immediately after cease-fire \r\nappeared to be the most viable way to complement our efforts in the important \r\ntask ahead of the Mozambican nation. The United Nations and the entire \r\ninternational community are therefore once again called upon to extend their \r\nsolidarity to the people of Mozambique at this moment, the most critical of \r\nits history since national independence. \r\nAs for elections, which will take place one year after the signature of \r\nthe General Peace Agreement, many efforts are being made, and there is a \r\nnational political will to turn the elections into a real success, as the \r\ninternational community expects. However, because of the difficulties that \r\nthe electoral process will encounter, we shall appreciate and acknowledge \r\nevery possible material and financial assistance from the United Nations and \r\nthe international community, so that the process may be conducted without \r\nmajor bottlenecks and be truly just, free and fair. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n129 \r\n(Mr. Mocumbi. Mozambique) \r\nThe end of the cold war has offered good new prospects for the \r\nstrengthening of North-South cooperation. The year 1992 already stands as an \r\nimportant landmark for the United Nations and for the future of \r\nmultilateralism and international cooperation for development. \r\nIn Cartagena de Indias the eighth session of the United Nations \r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) brought about a new partnership \r\nfor development based on the recognition of sovereign equality, mutual \r\ninterest and shared responsibilities for the goals of sustained growth of the \r\nworld economy and the reactivation of development in the developing \r\ncountries. My delegation welcomes the Conference\u0027s decision to redirect \r\nUNCTAD activities and to strengthen its mandate in accordance with the demands \r\nof the post-cold-war period. We wish to reaffirm our support for the \r\nCartagena Commitment, and in this context we call for the intensification of \r\nUNCTAD assistance to the least developed countries. \r\nThe Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro constituted a historic and universal \r\ngathering which set in motion a long-term process of international cooperation \r\naimed at saving the planet and future generations from environmental \r\ndestruction. It led to important and unprecedented policy agreements, a broad \r\nprogramme of action and two Conventions. The outcome of the Summit embodies \r\nthe highest level of political commitment to sustainable development policies \r\nand practices calling for the integration of environment and development. \r\nThe critical question now is the implementation of the Rio commitments \r\nand their effective follow-up and review, especially with regard to \r\nAgenda 21. In this connection, my delegation stands ready to participate in \r\nN_ \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n130 \r\n(Mr. Mocumbi. Mozambique) \r\nthe forthcoming discussions on the establishment of the commission on \r\nsustainable development. In our view, that commission should serve as an \r\neffective mechanism at a global level for the follow-up of the United Nations \r\nConference on Environment and Development and for promoting dialogue and \r\ncommon approaches on environment and development matters, while giving \r\nadequate attention to the diversity of situations and experiences of Member \r\nStates and regions of the world. In this regard, it is our firm conviction \r\nthat the composition of the commission should take into account the principle \r\nof equitable geographical distribution and provide for close working links \r\nwith all agencies of the United Nations system, especially with the United \r\nNations regional commissions and other international development \r\ninstitutions. Bearing in mind the follow-up of the Earth Summit, the \r\ncommission should give the utmost priority to the question of the means of \r\nimplementation of Agenda 21, namely, financial resources, capacity-building \r\nand technology transfer. \r\nDuring the past months the process of reform in the economic and social \r\nsectors of the United Nations system has evolved to the present critical \r\nstage. My delegation is encouraged by the growing consensus on, and renewed \r\nefforts to revitalize, the Economic and Social Council as a central and \r\ncredible forum for dialogue and formulation of international strategies as \r\nveil as for a more effective coordination and harmonization of actions of the \r\nunited Nations system. I should like to underline the great importance of the \r\ncurrent reform exercise, which should ultimately lead to enhancing the \r\neffectiveness and efficient functioning of the United Nations system, in order \r\nto be more responsive to the current needs of international economic \r\ncooperation and to promote the development of developing countries. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n131 \r\n(Mr. Mocumbi. Mozambique) \r\nLikewise, we attach great importance to the reform measures aimed at \r\nimproving the capacity of the United Nations to coordinate and deliver in a \r\ntimely manner humanitarian assistance to refugees and displaced persons, in \r\nsituations both of conflict and of natural disasters. \r\nThe evolving world situation has opened a new window of fresh \r\nopportunities and challenges to the whole international community and to the \r\nUnited Nations in particular. In this regard, my delegation has carefully \r\nstudied the Secretary-General\u0027s report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/47/1), as well as his report entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277). \r\nWe think that the Secretary-General\u0027s assessment is very timely and \r\npertinent in the current United Nations history. We have learned from our own \r\nexperience that both an agenda for peace and an agenda for development \r\nconstitute important and inseparable issues in today\u0027s world. We therefore \r\nstrongly believe in the role of the United Nations as the most appropriate \r\nforum for the harmonization of the global interests of all nations and for the \r\npromotion of an appropriate political atmosphere of understanding, consensus \r\nand international cooperation among the peoples and nations of the world. \r\nMay I invite, from this floor, all Member States jointly to rededicate \r\nand commit ourselves to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations, \r\ngiving it the necessary thrust, so as to enable it to fulfil with zeal and \r\nconfidence its tasks as the guardian of international peace and security, as \r\nprescribed in the Charter. \r\nA/47/PV.13 \r\n132 \r\nAGENDA ITEM 8 (continued) \r\nADOPTION OF THE AGENDA AND ORGANIZATION OF WORK: NOTE BY THE \r\nSECRETARY-GENERAL (A/47/243) \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The General Assembly will now consider the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s request for the inclusion of an additional item in the \r\nagenda of the forty-seventh session. \r\nIn this connection, a note by the Secretary-General has been circulated \r\nin document A/47/243. In his note, the Secretary-General, pursuant to rule 15 \r\nof the rules of procedure, requests that an additional item of an important \r\nand urgent character be placed on the agenda, entitled \"Financing of the \r\nUnited Nations Operation in Somalia\". Owing to the nature of the item, he \r\nalso requests that the item be allocated to the Fifth Committee for \r\nconsideration. \r\nUnder the circumstances of the present case, may I take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly agrees that the provision of rule 40 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, which would require a meeting of the General Committee on the \r\nquestion of the inclusion of an additional item on the agenda, could be waived? \r\nIt was so decided. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: May I also take it that the Assembly wishes to \r\ninclude an additional item to read as follows: \"Financing of the United \r\nNations Operation in Somalia\", and to allocate that item to the Fifth \r\nCommittee for consideration? \r\nIt was so decided. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Chairman of the Fifth Committee will be informed \r\nof the decision just taken. \r\nThe meeting rose at 8 p.m. \r\n"
