Your qualities as a \r\nstatesman, which you have amply demonstrated, and your skills as a seasoned \r\ndiplomat are solid assets which ensure the success of our work. I wish to \r\ncongratulate you most warmly on your election to this post and to assure you \r\nof our complete support and cooperation. \r\nI also wish to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi, \r\nAmbassador of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, who guided the forty-sixth \r\nsession of our Assembly with a competence, distinction, and effectiveness that \r\nI wish to emphasize today with pride. Another source of legitimate pride for \r\nus is the work accomplished by the Secretary-General of our Organization, \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. \r\nA/47/PV. 14 \r\n6 \r\n(Mr. Brahimi. Algeria) \r\nOnly a few months have gone by since he began his term of office, and \r\nalready the record is impressive. There can be no doubt that \r\nMr. Boutros-Ghali has brought to the United Nations a spirit of initiative, \r\ndetermination, and lucid leadership which it needs so much to face the \r\nchallenges posed by the fast pace of history at this century\u0027s end. The \r\nAgenda for Peace, his first annual report, along with his major statements and \r\nhis remarks before the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and at the Jakarta \r\nsummit of non-aligned countries, bespeak his vision and courage, which command \r\nour full support and esteem. \r\nI cannot fail to reiterate here our congratulations to all the new \r\nMembers of the United Nations and to welcome them to this forum. \r\nBearing as it does so much hope and promise, the end of the cold war and \r\nof the bipolar division of the world has not yet realized any of the hopes it \r\nhas given rise to with regard to the promotion of peace and international \r\ncooperation. The spectre of war, the horror of famine and privation, the \r\ntrampling of human dignity, and the denial of the right of peoples to \r\nself-determination still constitute the realities of the plight of many \r\npeoples. \r\nIn fact, the so-called world order remains a concept without substance \r\nfor the overwhelming majority of mankind, whose economic and social situation \r\nis steadily deteriorating and who also have reason to fear that this new order \r\nis being established outside the bounds of the basic principles of the United \r\nNations charter and without meeting the need to democratize international \r\nrelations. \r\nIt is time to embark upon a genuine dialogue in order to shape the \r\ninternational relations of the future. This is a vital task of the United \r\nA/47/PV. 14 \r\n7 \r\n(Mr. Brahimi. Algeria) \r\nNations, and the Organization\u0027s current prestige makes us believe that the \r\ntime is ripe to embark upon such an enterprise. Never before has the United \r\nNations seen so many hopes crystallized around it; never has it undertaken so \r\nmany initiatives or put so many plans on the drawing board. Whether the \r\nUnited Nations initiatives and plans are met by acceptance and praise as is \r\noften the case, or critized, as sometimes happens, it is a fact that this more \r\nassertive presence of the United Nations is one of the most positive results \r\nof the major changes that have taken place on the international arena in \r\nrecent years. \r\nThe Security Council summit held last January, the proposals submitted by \r\nthe Secretary-General, the debates in the Economic and Social Council last \r\nJuly on the role of the United Nations system in the strengthening of \r\ninternational cooperation for development, and the results of the 10th summit \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement held at the beginning of this month in Jakarta are \r\nall contributions to the joint thinking and action aimed at strengthening the \r\nUnited Nations and promoting its effectiveness. \r\nIt is hoped that this session of the General Assembly will be a new \r\nstarting-point for the United Nations that will place it resolutely on the \r\npath of greater democratization and enhance its effectiveness in promoting \r\npeace, cooperation and development. This is exactly what has been called for \r\nin the Jakarta Message, which was presented right here by the current \r\nPresident of the Non-Aligned Movement, His Excellency President Suharto of \r\nIndonesia. \r\nThe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has more than ever a positive role \r\nto play in the establishment, through dialogue and the harmonization of views, \r\nof a just, well-balanced world order which ensures international peace and \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n8 \r\n(Mr. Brahimi, Algeria) \r\nsecurity, the right to development, and the promotion of more equitable \r\neconomic relations. The United Nations constitutes a natural and privileged \r\nspace for the action of the Non-Aligned, who intend in this way to particpate \r\nfully in the current process of restructuring and strengthening the United \r\nNations. In this respect, restructuring initiatives should first of all aim \r\nat achieving a correct balance of prerogatives between the General Assembly \r\nand the Security Council. This undertaking should also meet the need to allow \r\naccess to the Council for all major cultural, political and geographic \r\ngroupings. \r\nAlgeria, which, since its independence, has undergone major \r\ntransformations in all areas and which has taken significant steps towards \r\nprogress and development, today faces a crisis which we do not underestimate \r\nand whose seriousness we in no way conceal. This crisis threatens the \r\nachievements made by our people through effort and sacrifice over three long \r\ndecades. While analyzing without any self-indulgence the causes of this \r\ncrisis, and while in no way trying to deny our own mistakes or the \r\nresponsibilities of the State in this situation, we affirm confidently and \r\nwith determination that our people has the means, capacity and will to \r\novercome this crisis and to embark again on global development and the \r\nbuilding of a society based on social justice and real democracy. This is the \r\nsubstance of the message behind the program of government approved recently by \r\nthe High Committee of State. \r\nThis responsible posture in the face of those challenges permits us to \r\nrecall as well the external constraints that have worsened the difficulties we \r\nface. This means that we expect our partners to cooperate readily in order to \r\nreduce the negative impact of an unfavorable external environment, or at least \r\nthat they not hamper the efforts of our people. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n9-10 \r\n(Mr. Brahimi. Algeria) \r\nAlgeria pursues a non-aligned policy aimed at promoting stability, peace, \r\njustice and cooperation in the region to which it belongs and in the world at \r\nlarge. In the Mediterranean, Algeria works for a new era of solidarity that \r\nresponds to the aspirations of the peoples on both coasts of this great shared \r\ninterior sea. Mechanisms for regular consultation and dialogue have been set \r\nup in order to promote the establishment of a comprehensive framework for \r\npeace, security, good-neighbourliness, solidarity and mutually advantageous \r\ncooperation. \r\nThe united Maghreb process which is rallying the energies of the member \r\ncountries of the Arab Maghreb Union and which constitutes a fundamental \r\naspiration of their peoples cannot but contribute to serving the cause of \r\npeace, relations of good-neighbourliness and cooperation between its different \r\nmembers and in the Mediterranean basin, the Arab world, and Africa. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n11 \r\n(Mr. Brahimi. Algeria) \r\nThere are two issues that are of special importance to my country. \r\nParticipation by the international community is required in dealing with \r\nboth. For the first of these, we wholeheartedly call for a peaceful solution, \r\nin consonance with international legality, to the situation of tension that \r\nexists between Libya and the major Western Powers. It is a situation that \r\nstands in the way of the building of the Arab Maghreb and threatens the \r\nstability of the whole region. The international community should respond to \r\nthe flexibility that characterizes the Libyan posture and to the initiatives \r\nand proposals that have been put forth. \r\nOn the other hand, the delays in the implementing the United Nations \r\nsettlement plan for the organization of a self-determination referendum for \r\nthe people of the Western Sahara continue to be the source of grave concern \r\nfor us and for the international community as a whole. Algeria hopes that the \r\ntwo parties to the conflict will refrain from any action that could hamper or \r\ndelay the implementation of the peace plan prepared jointly by the United \r\nNations and the Organization of African Unity with the full agreement of both \r\nparties. Algeria also hopes that the international community, through the \r\nUnited Nations and its Secretary-General, will redouble its efforts to \r\nimplement the plan in order to reach the desired solution. \r\nOf late, there have been positive developments in the disarmament issue. \r\nHowever, we look forward to a great deal of additional effort on the part of \r\nthe nuclear States, which, we must state not the major Powers alone. In this \r\ncontext, we note with satisfaction the conclusion of negotiations on the issue \r\nof a chemical weapons Convention in Geneva. However, this development will \r\nhave limited effects so long as it is not accompanied by concrete measures in \r\nthe field of nuclear disarmament, especially in a region as sensitive as the \r\nMiddle East, where a real nuclear threat persists. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n12 \r\n(Mr. Brahimi. Algeria) \r\nOnly if earnest efforts are made in this direction and significant \r\nprogress is achieved will that Convention - the conclusion of which is an \r\naccomplishment that we commend - respond to the concerns and expectations of \r\nall the parties concerned. Only then will it be possible to implement the \r\nConvention on a just non-discriminatory basis will and, thereby, ensure the \r\nuniversal acceptance necessary to this undertaking of genuine disarmament. \r\nThese were the observations and legitimate concerns expressed by the Arab \r\ncountries through a resolution adopted a few days ago, which they expect the \r\ninternational community to take into account. \r\nIn spite of the significant progress achieved in the field of \r\ndisarmament, it remains true that to address the issue of security in a manner \r\nthat focuses on one specific region and shows concern for the security of the \r\nfew without taking into account the interests and concerns of the many is to \r\nfall short of the objectives and ideals enshrined in the United Nations \r\nCharter. That is why the Non-Aligned Movement has just reaffirmed the \r\nunshakeable conviction of all its members that there is no peace or security \r\nother than peace and security for all, and that in order for peace and \r\nsecurity to be lasting they must be addressed in all their dimensions and not \r\nonly in the military aspects. In an increasingly interdependent world, peace \r\nand security should not be dissociated from their corollaries, namely economic \r\ndevelopment and the upholding of human rights. \r\nWhile we express satisfaction at the progress achieved in the settlement \r\nof certain regional disputes, we note with concern the emergence of new crises \r\nin the wake of the cold war, at a time when many of the old crises and issues \r\ncontinue to await just and lasting solutions. Cambodia has embarked upon a \r\nprocess of peaceful settlement thanks to the will of the Cambodian people to \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n13 \r\n(Mr. Brahimi. Algeria) \r\nbuild for themselves a future of peace and harmony, to the determination of \r\nthe international community and the efforts of the United Nations which now \r\nsupervises the implementation of a peace plan with the participation of \r\nAlgeria. \r\nThe inter-community talks on Cyprus, under the auspices of the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, have reached a crucial stage. We \r\nhope that the remaining differences will be ironed out during the next round \r\nof talks, in a context of respect for the sovereignty, unity, territorial \r\nintegrity, and the non-aligned nature of the island. \r\nThe recent news that has reached us from South Africa revives hope that \r\nthere will be a resumption of the process that began with the release of \r\nNelson Mandela, President of the African National Congress and was endangered \r\nin recent months by the return of violence encouraged by the complacent \r\nattitude of the Government. While we welcome such positive developments and \r\nthe encouraging prospects that pave the road toward the desired solution, we \r\nmust stress that the experience of recent months makes it necessary to closely \r\nmonitor developments in South Africa with a great deal of watchfulness and to \r\nlend full support to our brethren in that country. \r\nThe horrific plight of the Somali people is a glaring example of the \r\ndeteriorating situation in many parts of Africa, a continent that has been \r\nincreasingly marginalized and whose role has been greatly diminished. It is \r\nessential to learn a lesson from this tragedy, which underscores the need for \r\nurgent humanitarian aassistance for the Somali people side by side with the \r\nintensification of United Nations efforts to reach a political settlement to \r\nthis crisis. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n14-15 \r\n(Mr. Brahimi. Algeria) \r\nThe question of Palestine continues to be the crux of the Middle East \r\nconflict. Given our firm commitment to Palestine\u0027s freedom of choice, has \r\naccepted the option chosen by the Palestinian leadership that has made it \r\npossible to negotiate with a view to reaching a solution to the Middle East \r\ncrisis. We in Algeria remain convinced that the success of the negotiations, \r\nbegun within the framework of the process initiated in Madrid, depends on \r\nreadiness by Israel to comply with international legality, especially in \r\nregard to the following: \r\nFirst, United Nations resolutions must be adhered to and implemented. \r\nSecondly, the operations of settlement in the occupied Arab territories must \r\nbe halted and existing Israeli settlements must be dismantled. Thirdly, the \r\ncontinuity of the different stages of the peace process must be guaranteed \r\nuntil a comprehensive solution is found that would guarantee to the \r\nPalestinian people the exercise of its full national rights, including its \r\nright to self-determination and to the establishment of its own State on its \r\nterritory with Al-Quds as its capital. \r\nMy country is convinced that participation by the United Nations in every \r\nstage of this peace process in the Middle East can contribute to the \r\nattainment of the objective that would guarantee a just comprehensive peace in \r\nthe region. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n16 \r\n(Mr. Brahimi. Algeria) \r\nWe emphasize once again that the Palestinian problem and the Middle East \r\nconflict are one and the same thing. They are indivisible. Consequently, the \r\nsolution which must be found cannot be partial or limited to certain parties \r\ninvolved in the conflict. In other words, and peace can be established in the \r\nregion only if it is peace for all the parties concerned, including the \r\nPalestinians. \r\nAlgeria wishs to reaffirm here its commitment to the independance, \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon within its internationally \r\nrecognized borders. \r\nIt condemns the continued Israeli occupation of part of southern Lebanon \r\nas well as Israel\u0027s repeated attacks against Lebanon\u0027s territory and its \r\npeople. We demand the total and unconditional withdrawal of the Israeli army \r\nfrom southern Lebanon in accordance with Security Council resolution \r\n425 (1978). \r\nWe also reaffirm the need to preserve Iraq\u0027s unity and territorial \r\nintegrity. It must be clear to all that any negative development in this \r\nrespect will create grave problems for all the countries of the region. It is \r\nour hope that respect for international legality will lead to reconciliation \r\nbetween the States of that region which continues to suffer the horrific \r\nconsequences of the devastating war that followed Iraq\u0027s invasion of Kuwait. \r\nIn the same region, there has been another development whose gravity \r\ncannot be underestimated. It is Iran\u0027s illegal occupation of the island of \r\nAbu Mousa thus renegging on its commitments and agreements concluded with the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates. We support the demand of t.ie Government of the United \r\nArab Emirates that the unilateral measures taken by Iran be nullified and that \r\na solution to the problem be found through negotiation in observance of \r\nlegality and international law. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n17 \r\n(Mr. Brahimi. Algeria) \r\nIn the face of the terrible plight of the peoples of former Yugoslavia, \r\nthe major imperative on which all efforts should focus is to ensure the \r\nimmediate return of peace to all of the territory of the former Yugoslavia, \r\nwith respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of \r\nall the republics that have emerged therefrom. In this respect, the situation \r\nwhich persists in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a source of grave \r\nconcern because of the increasingly terrible crimes that are being committed \r\nthere. The international community, and in particular the United Nations, \r\nmust take every measure necessary in order to put an end to the plight of the \r\nentire Bosnian people and to the threats to peace and security in the region. \r\nOne of the most disturbing aspects of the current world situation is the \r\nconstant exacerbation of the economic situation of the developing countries \r\nand negative developments that continue to rock the world\u0027s economy. The \r\nsharp slow-down in the growth of world trade, which declined from 8 per cent \r\nin 1988 to barely 3 per cent in 1991, the increasing deterioration in the \r\nprices of raw materials at an average 15 per cent pace in real terms in 1990, \r\nthe persistance of the foreign debt problem of the developing countries with \r\nthe attendant acceleration of the slow-down of growth in the developed \r\ncountries, and the magnitude of the financial needs of the former USSR and the \r\ncountries of Central and Eastern Europe, show how great are the challenges to \r\nbe met. \r\nGiven the new opportunities and the new challenges to be met in this \r\nperiod of profound change, the revitalizaion of international cooperation for \r\ndevelopment and strengthening the role of the United Nations system in this \r\nundertaking should be the high-priority task of the day. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n18 \r\n(Mr. Brahimi. Algeria) \r\nThis requires first and foremost the existence of real political will. \r\nSome progress has been achieved in this direction. The declaration by the \r\nSecurity Council at its summit meeting last January recognized the close \r\nrelationship that exists between peace and development. This recognition \r\nshould be translated into increased agreement on the need to move the economic \r\nand social dimension from the secondary position it now occupies to the \r\nforefront and to make it a principal and permanent concern of the United \r\nNations. \r\nIn fact, at a time when a great deal of thinking is taking place on the \r\nconcept and the instruments of preventive diplomacy, the success of renewed \r\ngrowth and development in the countries of the South affect the credibility \r\nand the effectiveness of any attempt to strengthen the role of the United \r\nNations in the areas of international peace and security. \r\nThe results of the Eighth United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) held at Cartagena in February of 1992, the results of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development held at Rio de \r\nJaneiro last June, and the General Assembly\u0027s adoption of a new United Nations \r\nagreement for the development of Africa in the 1990s, all constitute new \r\nmilestones in our awareness of international interdependence and the need for \r\nrenewed international cooperation. \r\nOne of the basic objectives that we must strive to attain in this \r\nparticularly difficult situation in the third world is the need to ensure a \r\nbigger share in world trade for the developing countries, the formulation of a \r\ncomprehensive strategy that addresses the issue of indebtedness and the \r\nreactivation of the flow of funds and investments from the developed to the \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n19-20 \r\n(Mr. Brahimi. Algeria) \r\ndeveloping countries. In general, the creation of favourable external \r\nconditions is a vital requirement in the case of the developing countries \r\nwhich are trying to carry out wide-ranging fundamental reforms at a very high \r\nsocial and political cost. This is a basic requirement on which the United \r\nNations system should mobilize the international community. \r\nThe implementation of \"Agenda 21\" and the commitments that arise \r\ntherefrom, especially with regard to financial support and transfer of \r\ntechnology, represent a major test both of the political will of the developed \r\ncountries and of the capacity of our Organization, through the Commission on \r\nSustainable Development, to ensure the implementation, follow-up and \r\ncoordination of a programme which aims at bringing about real and creative \r\nchanges in the concept of development and international cooperation. \r\nThere are new and vast horizons before the United Nations. Those \r\nhorizons give the work of this session of the Assembly particular importance \r\nand substance. The international community must seize the opportunity to \r\ndevelop at this world forum an integrated approach to the promotion of peace, \r\nsecurity, and stability in economic and social development and international \r\ncooperation. In so doing, it would contribute to the optimum utilization of \r\nour Organization\u0027s great potential. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n21 \r\nMr. ESSY (Cote d\u0027lvoire) (interpretation from French): We grieved \r\nto learn of the aviation disaster yesterday in Lagos, which caused the death \r\nof 163 members of the Nigerian military. On this sad occasion I should like \r\nto convey to the people and the Government of Nigeria our most sincere \r\ncondolences. \r\nFirst Sir, on behalf of the delegation of Cote d\u0027lvoire I congratulate \r\nyou on your election as President of the current session of the General \r\nAssembly. The confidence expressed in you by the Assembly is recognition both \r\nof you personally and your professionalism and of the important role played by \r\nyour country in the achievement of the noble objectives of our Organization. \r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi, who discharged his responsibilities as \r\nPresident of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly with such talent \r\nand dignity. \r\nFinally, I should not forget our Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to whom I should like to address our most sincere \r\ncongratulations on the vitality and ability he has demonstrated in the \r\nmanagement of our Organization. His report, which provides an exhaustive view \r\nof the activities of the Organization, enables us to take up our debate with \r\nspecific, current information. \r\nWe most warmly welcome all those States that have just joined the \r\nOrganization, thus highlighting its universality. \r\nEvents in recent years have caused serious upheavals in international \r\nrelations. The division of the world into two rival blocs is a thing of the \r\npast. The trend towards negotiation and emerging cooperation is the prelude \r\nto a new world order that has yet to take shape. Situations and certainties, \r\nwhich had in the past seemed immutable are changing, slowly but surely. We \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n22 \r\n(Mr. Essy. Cote d\u0027lvoire) \r\nare currently witnessing political, economic, social and cultural \r\ntransformations. We hope these developments, which seem to augur new \r\ninternational relations, will make it possible to meet the challenges of today. \r\nThe have-nots of the world greeted with great hope the end of the cold \r\nwar, and with the end of the arms race looked to the future sure that the \r\nworld was moving towards peace, justice and solidarity. \r\nUnfortunately, while solidarity should have been strengthened, \r\nselfishness and the defence of short-term interests have intensified, to the \r\ndetriment of cooperation for the mutual benefit of the various partners in \r\ninternational relations. \r\nToday the developed countries and the major economic, monetary and \r\nfinancial institutions have found it necessary to link their assistance to the \r\nestablishment of what they consider to be democracy in the recipient \r\ncountries, for which it is now a matter of linking the grant of external \r\nfinancial resources not merely to an economic reform programme based on the \r\nrules of the market, but also to respect for political pluralism. \r\nRegrettably, on the world scale, there is no longer a strategic or \r\neconomic alternative that might counter this approach. \r\nIf democracy is taken to mean more justice and increased popular \r\nparticipation in the management of a country\u0027s affairs, the Ivorian Government \r\ncan be proud of its record. \r\nIndeed, the first version of the Constitution of Cote d\u0027lvoire, which has \r\nbeen in effect since independence, provides for a multiparty system, in its \r\narticles 6 and 7. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n23 \r\n(Mr. Essy. CSte d\u0027lvoire) \r\nIn Cote d\u0027lvoire, the idea of democracy has always been part and parcel \r\nof the political process. Democracy and human rights have no borders. They \r\nare universal values, which should nevertheless have national roots. They \r\ncannot be imported, sold or bought, neither can they be imposed from outside. \r\nIn international terms, this democratic process should logically entail \r\ngreater involvement by States, be they large, small or medium-sized, in the \r\nconsideration and solving of international problems of common interest. \r\nTherefore, it is not enough that the United Nations should become more \r\nuniversal merely within the General Assembly. This trend must also be \r\nreflected in the other principal organs if the Organization\u0027s democratic \r\nnature is to be enhanced. \r\nIn spite of the progress achieved in various fields, an overview of the \r\nmap of the world indicates that the international landscape is still covered \r\nby large grey areas of real and potential conflict. The stability of States \r\nis shaken by violent religious, social, cultural and linguistic struggles, as \r\nwell as by unusually grave economic problems. \r\nThe countries of the South in general, and African countries in \r\nparticular, with their scores of refugees, are still prey to conflicts that \r\nseriously jeopardize the peace and security that are essential for their \r\ndevelopment. \r\nIn South Africa, while we welcome the considerable progress achieved in \r\ndismantling apartheid, we are saddened by the escalation of violence. In this \r\nregard, we must appeal most urgently to all our South African brothers to put \r\nan end to the violence, massacres and abuses of all types that continue to \r\ncast a pall over the country and further to complicate the already difficult \r\nand complex task of those who are striving to build in South Africa a \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n24 \r\n(Mr. Essy. Cote d\u0027lvoire) \r\ndemocratic, non-racial system through dialogue and negotiation. We welcome \r\nthe forthcoming meeting between Mr. Nelson Mandela and Mr. Frederik de Klerk, \r\nand we hope that the negotiations under way will lead to a resumption of the \r\nnegotiations within the Convention for a Democratic South Africa. \r\nElsewhere in Africa internal conflicts with tragic consequences are still \r\ncausing upheavals in Somalia, Rwanda and Liberia, to name but a few countries. \r\nWith regard to a country on our borders Liberia the Committee of \r\nFive, chaired by President Houphouet-Boigny and set up by the fourteenth \r\nsession of the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), held in Abuja on 6 July 1991, met \r\nfour times in Yamoussoukro and once in Geneva, in April 1992. The agreement \r\nthat emerged from these many meetings, commonly called the Yamoussoukro IV \r\nAgreement, was endorsed by summit meetings of ECOWAS, the Organization of \r\nAfrican Unity and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries as the best framework \r\nfor finding a just and lasting solution to the Liberian crisis. \r\nNevertheless, military aspects of the implementation of the Agreement \r\nhave caused difficulties, with regard to the billeting and disarming of the \r\nbelligerents, essential steps for the holding of free, fair and democratic \r\nelections. \r\nThe appearance of a new faction, the United Liberation Movement for \r\nDemocracy in Liberia (ULIMO), on the scene of the Liberian conflict, has \r\ncreated a new situation of insecurity, increasing the existing distrust \r\nbetween the parties to the conflict. \r\nWe hope that the new consultations under way, initiated by the President \r\nof ECOWAS and the Chairman of the Committee of the Five, will make possible \r\nreconsideration of the problems of Liberia as a whole in order more \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n25 \r\n(Mr. Essy. Cote d\u0027lvoire) \r\neffectively to focus on the factors that will enable all the armed factions to \r\napply in good faith the provisions of the Yamoussoukro IV Agreement. \r\nWe urgently appeal to all Liberians to go a step further and to begin a \r\nconstructive dialogue that alone can effectively help the international \r\ncommunity to enable them to find a lasting solution to their problems and to \r\nthe future of their country.* \r\n* Sheikh Salem Sabah Al Saleh Al Sabah (Kuwait), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n26 \r\n(Mr. Essy.

President Houphouet-Boigny, who has been working tirelessly \r\nfor peace in Africa and throughout the world, will fully support the process \r\nbegun in order to solve the Liberian crisis so that the fraternal people of \r\nLiberia, to which we are linked by so many bonds, might finally have peace. \r\nIn Angola, after 14 years of liberation struggle against the colonizing \r\nPower followed by 16 years of fratricidal struggle. Cote d\u0027lvoire commends the \r\nsigning of the peace agreements which occurred in Lisbon in May 1991. \r\nCote d\u0027lvoire most earnestly hopes that the multipartite elections that are to \r\nbe held on 29 and 30 September will take place under the best possible \r\ncircumstances so as to enable the fraternal people of Angola freely to choose \r\ntheir officials and fully to concentrate on the enormous task of \r\nreconstruction and development that lies ahead. \r\nIn the Middle East, the Israeli-Arab conflict remains a major and \r\nconstant source of concern despite the new peace initiatives that emerged from \r\nthe historic Madrid meeting. \r\nHope, however, has been renewed owing to the recent negotiations during \r\nwhich we noted with satisfaction an encouraging attitude on the part of the \r\nparties to the conflict, which seem determined to move forward with the peace \r\nprocess. \r\nThe situation in the Persian Gulf still remains alarming, and the \r\npossibility of the conflict resuming cannot be ruled out. Hence we shall \r\ncontinue fully to support, as we did last year during our mandate in the \r\nSecurity Council, the complete implementation of all resolutions linked to the \r\nGulf Crisis, especially Security Council resolution 687 (1991), of \r\n3 April 1991, which lays down the conditions for a permanent cease-fire in the \r\nGulf governing post-war relations between Iraq and Kuwait. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n27 \r\n(Mr. Essv. Cote d\u0027lvoire) \r\nFurthermore, the quest for increased stability in some States is \r\naccompanied by the troubling phenomenon of sometimes violent disintegration in \r\nother States, in Europe and in various areas of the developing world. The \r\nsituation in the Balkans and the tragedy of the people of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina are a perfect illustration of this. \r\nConfronted with these various situations, we must seek a new approach to \r\nsettling conflicts. Quite rightly, we are now stressing once again the need \r\nfor preventive diplomacy, which would have the effect of identifying areas of \r\npotential conflict and stemming crises before they degenerate into armed \r\nconfrontation. \r\nThat is why my country. Cote d\u0027lvoire, supports the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on strengthening the capacity of the United Nations for \r\npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping. This report has the same \r\nobjective as that of the Secretary-General of the Organization of African \r\nUnity (OAU), that is, to create mechanisms for the prevention, management and \r\nsettlement of conflicts, the principle of which was adopted during the \r\ntwenty-eighth regular session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government \r\nof the OAU, which met in Dakar last July. \r\nThe concerns and the worries that we reiterated last year from this very \r\nrostrum, which pertained to signs of a slowdown in world economic activity, \r\nhave unfortunately become reality, to the extent that we have seen a real \r\ndecline in the growth rate of global production of the world economy in 1991, \r\naccompanied by a concomitant drop in the volume of world trade. \r\nIn this regard, we should emphasize the substantial drop in the growth \r\nlevel of imports of industrialized countries, the major export markets for raw \r\nmaterials produced by developing countries. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n28 \r\n(Mr. Essv. CSte d\u0027lvoire) \r\nThe impact of such a situation on African countries has been \r\ncatastrophic, since the recession in the industrialized countries has not only \r\nkept raw-materials prices at very low levels, but has also had the consequence \r\nof reducing the quantities exported, thereby causing a very substantial drop \r\nin the export earnings of African countries. \r\nNevertheless, in spite of the unfavourable economic environment, African \r\ncountries including my own. Cote d\u0027lvoire, in particular have courageously \r\ncontinued to pursue efforts undertaken as part of the structural adjustment \r\nprocess and drastic economic reform, with all that this entails in terms of \r\nthe risk of social unrest. \r\nAs regards my country, those measures have none the less allowed for the \r\nestablishment of macro-economic balances, which means that we might achieve a \r\n5 per cent growth rate by 1995. \r\nHowever, in order to reduce as soon as possible the social cost of \r\nstructural adjustment measures, we must resume the still-unfinished debate on \r\nNorth-South relations between rich and poor countries, between industrialized \r\ncountries and those that do not have the means of paying their debts nor of \r\nrelaunching their stricV^n economies. \r\nIn this regard, we should, in the financial sphere, come up with a final \r\nsolution to external debt problems that takes into account debtor countries\u0027 \r\nactual repayment abilities. This restructuring of external debt should be \r\nsupplemented by the granting of substantial financial assistance, on \r\nconcessional terms, as was the case with Eastern Europe. \r\nWhile we are asking developing countries to make ever-greater efforts and \r\nsacrifices, we see from the analysis of recent statements by International \r\nMonetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank heads, Messrs. Michel Camdessus and \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n29 \r\n(Mr. Essv. Cote d\u0027lvoire) \r\nLewis Preston, that rich countries are the ones setting a bad example in \r\nmanaging the world economy. These countries, they say, are not conforming to \r\nany budgetary discipline, which ends up costing developing countries dearly. \r\nThose officials also pointed out that only 5 of the 20 richest countries \r\nin the world have devoted 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to \r\ndevelopment assistance, in accordance with the objectives set by the United \r\nNations. Even the International Development Association (IDA) today appears \r\nto be imperilled in that it is not sure that it will be able to obtain the $18 \r\nbillion considered absolutely necessary for its functioning. \r\nContrary to this trend, we welcome Japan\u0027s decision to hold, in 1993, a \r\nconference on development in Africa. \r\nAs President Houphouet-Boigny has often said: \"The real problem of \r\nAfrica today is above all economic and financial\". He also stated, recently \r\nat the OAU Summit in Dakar, that the only difference between developed and \r\ndeveloping countries is that the former have the technological capacity to \r\nprocess our raw materials into finished products for their own consumption \r\nand to use any surplus for export, while the latter can only export their raw \r\nmaterials, be they agricultural, mining or mineral products. \r\nSuch a situation must change, and to this end, the assistance and \r\ncooperation of our northern partners should no longer restrict us indefinitely \r\nto the role of providers of raw materials but rather enable us, thanks to the \r\nprocessing of part or all of our raw materials, to also become consumer \r\ncountries. \r\nBut pending this development, which should not be delayed, we producers \r\nof raw materials, be they agricultural, mining or mineral products, fervently \r\nhope that the markets for the majority of our commodities will be organized \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n30 \r\n(Mr. Essv. CSte d\u0027lvoire) \r\nwithin the framework of appropriate international agreements that would take \r\ninto account the best interests of both consumers and producers. \r\nThat is why I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to appeal \r\nmost earnestly to the States members of the European Economic Community (EEC), \r\nwhose constant support for developing countries has been unfailing, to take \r\ndetermined action, individally and collectively, in order to foster the \r\nforthcoming conclusion of new international agreements, particularly those \r\nrelating to coffee and cocoa, negotiations on which are currently under way. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n31 \r\n(Mr, Essy. Cote d\u0027lvoire) \r\nThis is also the place to affirm that, contrary to commonly-held views, \r\nwe remain convinced, as far as we are concerned, of the ability of \r\nwell-written international agreements on commodities to stabilize markets and \r\nthereby to foster the economic growth of countries that produce raw \r\nmaterials. Indeed, taking into account the overall importance of raw \r\nmaterials in the economies of developing countries, and in particular the \r\nextreme dependence of some of them on a single product or small number of \r\nproducts from which they draw their main source of revenue, we think it \r\nperfectly logical to acknowledge that these markets should be organized in \r\nsuch a way that, while guaranteeing regular supply for industries using these \r\nproducts, the prices remain stable so as not only to allow for decent earnings \r\nfor the processing industries but also to ensure remunerative prices and \r\npredictable earnings for producer countries. \r\nFurthermore, mutatis mutandis, such thinking underlay the idea of the \r\ncommon agricultural policy of the European Economic Community (EEC), the major \r\naim of which was to ensure the security of food supplies within the boundaries \r\nof the community at prices that were reasonable for the consumer and both \r\nstable and remunerative for the rural population. \r\nIndeed, no country in the world can remain indifferent to the drop in \r\nincome of its peasants. The United States of America and the member States of \r\nthe EEC have understood this so well that they spare no subsidy in helping \r\ntheir farmers keep their purchasing power on a par with their efforts. It is \r\ntherefore difficult for us to understand why the same machinery that has \r\nfunctioned so well internally and regionally in the Western countries cannot \r\nbe usefully adapted internationally within the framework of raw materials in \r\nthe relationship between North and South. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n32 \r\n(Mr. Essy. Cote d\u0027lvoire) \r\nTaking all this into consideration, it is perfectly obvious that only the \r\nconclusion of international agreements aimed at promoting stability in the \r\nrates of raw materials at remunerative prices would foster the implementation \r\nof production policies guaranteeing the preservation of the environment. In \r\nthis context, it is good that the Rio Conference emphasized the close link \r\nthat exists between the deterioration of the environment, indebtedness, and \r\nthe deterioration in the terms of trade. Indeed, Cote d\u0027lvoire, like many \r\nother countries, has had to intensify the exploitation of its natural \r\nresources in order to honour its international financial obligations. \r\nThis situation is not in the interests of sustainable development. For \r\nthat, as agreed in Rio, the industrialized countries must, as a matter of \r\nurgency, take the necessary steps to help in the transition of our economies \r\ntowards sustainable development, especially in implementing decisions aimed at \r\nthe elimination of obstacles in the trade of raw or processed goods and the \r\ntransfer of new and additional financial resources to developing countries. \r\nIn this regard. Agenda 21 has highlighted several ways to achieve the \r\nobjectives with regard to the transfer of resources through the following \r\nmachinery: through the special increase of resources in the form of the \r\n\"Earth Increment\" in the World Bank; through the global environmental facility \r\nthat will meet next December in Abidjan and whose objective is to increase its \r\nresources from $1.1 billion to $4.5 billion; and through debt alleviation, \r\nespecially for middle-income countries. \r\nIt is also worth noting that in Rio, several countries promised to \r\nincrease their transfer of resources to developing countries, committing \r\nthemselves to achieve 1 per cent of their gross national product to official \r\ndevelopment assistance by the year 2000. Some of them have announced special \r\ncontributions. By way of example, I cite the EEC, which hopes to reach \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n33 \r\n(Mr. Essy. CSte d\u0027lvoire) \r\n$4 billion, and Japan, which hopes to reach $8 billion in three years. We can \r\nonly express our sincere gratitude for these fortunate initiatives, just as we \r\ncommend those countries that have committed themselves to making contributions \r\nduring the current session of the General Assembly. \r\nOur hopes are placed in the Commission on Sustainable Development that is \r\nto meet at the ministerial level; its work will be decisive in following up on \r\nthe implementation of Agenda 21 programmes and their integration. In this \r\ncontext, and on behalf of my delegation, I would like to offer my sincere \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Maurice Strong for his magnificent work and to ask him \r\nto be kind enough to guide the first steps of the secretariat of that \r\nCommission, because in our view that is essential in order to guarantee the \r\neffective implementation and proficient and speedy follow-up of the \r\ncommitments made in Rio. \r\nAs regards the critical economic situation in Africa, we remain confident \r\nof the ability of the international community to mobilize itself in the \r\neffective support of the efforts of the African countries to realize the aims \r\nof the new United Nations agenda for the development of Africa for the 1990s \r\nadopted by the General Assembly in December 1991. The elements of this new \r\nagenda, dealing with the last decade of the twentieth century, constitute a \r\nmajor challenge that Africa must meet with success if it is not to be \r\nirredeemably marginalized at the dawn of the twenty-first century, so full of \r\npromise for humanity. \r\nThat is why the African countries, aware of the importance of the current \r\nand future stakes, as well as of their primary responsibility in achieving \r\ngrowth and sustainable development, have firmly committed themselves to \r\nregional integration and to accelerating the democratization process of their \r\ninternal institutions. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n34 \r\n(Mr. Essy. Cote d\u0027lvoire) \r\nThat is why is it is important that conditions for growth and development \r\nin Africa be achieved as soon as possible, because they are quite obviously \r\nthe sine qua non for the true and realistic exercise of the democracy that \r\ncements peace within African States, peace among African States, and peace \r\nbetween Africa and the rest of the world. \r\nAs President Houphouet-Boigny oftens says: \"Peace and poverty make poor \r\nbedfellows.\" That is why we exhort the international community to show more \r\nunderstanding for the question of remunerative prices for raw materials, upon \r\nwhich many developing countries depend, especially in Africa. Africa needs to \r\nbe considered by the rest of the world as a partner rather than a burden. The \r\npartnership it seeks implies dignity rather than dependency, mutual interests \r\nrather than charity. \r\nThe bipolar world that has held sway in the international order since \r\n1945 has crumbled. Since the time of Alexander of Macedonia, great empires \r\nhave arisen only to collapse in a process that has been broadly described by \r\nProfessor Paul Kennedy in his Rise and Fall of the Great Powers. \r\nEvery century brings its share of innovations and surprises. The \r\ntwentieth century which is now drawing to a close has brought great changes to \r\nhuman existence. It has seen people invent all sorts of instruments to \r\nadvance thought, to cure as well as to kill. Today\u0027s world seems to have \r\nfound unity through a certain number of values, among which is the primacy of \r\nlaw in international relations. Such a development can only strengthen the \r\nrole of the United Nations in the maintenance of peace. \r\nIt is thus up to every State to support the activity of our Organization \r\nin order to enable it to carry out its difficult task effectively. My \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n35 \r\n(Mr. Essy- CSte d\u0027lvoire) \r\ncountry, which has always made a determined search for peace the cornerstone \r\nof its foreign policy, will not fail to make its contribution to the building \r\nof this noble enterprise and to the shaping of the new world order which is \r\nemerging and which, to be solid and lasting, must be linked to the search for \r\na world of peace, justice, and shared well-being. \r\nA/47/PV. 14 \r\n36 \r\nMr• AL-SHARA (Syrian Arab Republic) (interpretation from Arabic): \r\nIt gives me great pleasure, on behalf of the Syrian delegation, to \r\ncongratulate the new President on his election to the presidency of the \r\nforty-seventh session of the General Assembly, particularly as our two \r\ncountries and peoples enjoy bonds of traditional friendship. I should also \r\nlike to express our appreciation to your predecessor, the permanent \r\nrepresentative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for the success and skill with \r\nwhich he presided over the proceedings of the previous session of the General \r\nAssembly. May we wish his sisterly country progress and prosperity. \r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to reiterate to the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations our confidence and our appreciation of \r\nhis unremitting efforts in the service of the international community and the \r\nprinciples and objectives of the United Nations Charter. In that respect, we \r\nvalue the effort that has gone into the preparation of his report entitled \"An \r\nAgenda for Peace\" and many of the valuable ideas contained therein. \r\nAs is customary in this forum, we welcome the new States Members which \r\nhave joined our international Organization and hope that their new membership \r\nwill contribute to the process of enhancing its effectiveness and \r\nstrengthening its role in formulating more democratic and equitable \r\ninternational relations. \r\nFor the third time, the twentieth century witnesses an important change \r\nin the political map of the world. The change is such that schools and \r\nlibraries all over the world have become in need of a new atlas, just as they \r\nhad in the wake\"of the two World Wars. We fear that, because of the \r\ncontinuing upheavals in the world the designers of that new atlas may have to \r\nleave a wide margin for possible new changes that may occur in the map of this \r\nplanet as it crosses the threshold into the twenty-first century. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Al-Shara. Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic) \r\nFortunately, that great change in the political map of the world has not \r\ntaken place through war, as was the case in the two previous instances. \r\nOtherwise, it would have meant the end of all life on earth. Regrettably, \r\nhowever, the change has not been totally devoid of tension and violence. It \r\nhas carried the seeds of small-scale wars that have spread here and there for \r\nnational, ethnic, religious, tribal, economic and social reasons. \r\nAt this historic juncture, the real concern is not only the number of \r\nvictims claimed by such small wars or the scale of the destruction that may \r\nensue, but rather, the possibility of the spread of the seeds of those small \r\nwars, in the North as well as in the South, in the absence of a world order \r\nthat is capable of containing and addressing their causes. \r\nThis is the major challenge which faces the United Nations today. It \r\nwould be paradoxical indeed if the twentieth century, whose grand bang of \r\nscientific and cultural achievements have been hailed by all, were to end with \r\nthe whimper of small was that are waged by people with small primitive minds \r\nthe international community cannot curb. \r\nMany have rightly spoken of the non-implementation of United Nations \r\nresolutions and of the paralysis of its Security Council during the years of \r\nthe cold war that used to rage between East and West. But the cold war has in \r\neffect been over for a few years now, and its demise has been officially \r\ndeclared by both sides. And yet, we find that the ultimate ambition of the \r\nSecurity Council today is no longer to stop the fighting and put an end to the \r\nmassacres in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Somalia, Afghanistan and other hotbeds of \r\ntension and conflict, but merely to try and deliver humanitarian assistance to \r\nsome of the peoples of those unfortunate countries. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n38 \r\n(Mr. Al-Shara. Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic) \r\nThe end of confrontation between East and West ought not to lead to the \r\nend of concern for the fate of the many peoples and countries which are being \r\ntorn apart by conflicts, as is happening today in Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nSomalia, Afghanistan and other places; nor should it lead to the withholding \r\nfrom their peoples of the assistance that would help heal their wounds and \r\nenable them to reconstruct what has been destroyed by conflict and war. \r\nIf only a very small percentage of the sums that used to be spent by the \r\ntwo camps on the cold War were channelled to the assistance of peoples of the \r\nthird world, such a small percentage would make it possible to overcome most \r\nof the difficulties and tragedies those peoples now face and to avoid further \r\nsuch disputes. \r\nAt a time when the world witnesses the disintegration of whole States and \r\nthe outbreak of civil wars and conflicts, one must appreciate the exceptional \r\nefforts that led to saving the Lebanese people from the inferno of civil war \r\nand helping them on the road to national reconciliation through the efforts of \r\nthe Lebanese themselves and the brotherly assistance and sacrifices of Syria. \r\nWe hope that pledges made to reconstruct what the civil war destroyed in \r\nLebanon and to contribute to the special fund created for that purpose will be \r\nhonoured. \r\nSince the end of the Second World War, the Middle East has enjoyed \r\nneither security nor stability because of the continuing Arab-Israeli conflict \r\nand its repercussions. But the convening of the Madrid conference last year \r\nhas opened for the first time, as all acknowledge, a rare and historic window \r\nof opportunity to achieve a just and comprehensive peace based on \r\ninternational legality and the resolutions of the United Nations, particularly \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n39-40 \r\n(Mr. Al-Shara. Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic) \r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978), which, \r\naccording to the Charter of the United Nations, are binding and must be \r\nimplemented by all parties to the conflict. \r\nAlmost a year has passed now since the convening of the Madrid \r\nconference. Ten months after the conference, the whole world came to realize \r\nthat the peace talks between the Arabs and the Israelis were futile, because \r\nof the intransigence and the evasiveness of the previous head of the Israeli \r\nGovernment, who admitted publicly after his defeat in the elections that his \r\nintention was to go on quibbling and prevaricating with the purpose of \r\nprolonging the negotiations for 10 more years. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n41 \r\n(Mr. Al-Shara. Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic) \r\nIt is also regrettable that the latest round of peace talks was concluded \r\nin Washington without the Israeli side changing the substance of its approach \r\nto the question of a full withdrawal from the Golan and the other occupied \r\nArab territories, including Al-Quds, despite the readiness of Syria and the \r\nother Arab parties to commit themselves to all that is required of them in \r\nconformity with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). It \r\nappears that the change in policies and priorities claimed by Mr. Rabin\u0027s \r\nGovernment in comparison with those of Mr. Shamir\u0027s Government to date lacks \r\nboth credibility and actual application. \r\nThe fact of the matter is that the great expectations and noticeable \r\nmomentum which accompanied the latest round of negotiations were a result of \r\nthe earnest contribution of the Arab side and the great impact of the Syrian \r\ndocument at both the regional and international levels. That comprehensive \r\ndocument contains the bases and principles of a peaceful settlement of the \r\nArab-Israeli conflict in conformity with the Charter and resolutions of the \r\nUnited Nations, which were the basis for the convening of the Madrid \r\nConference. \r\nThe international community has affirmed that the achievement of peace in \r\nthe Middle East has always been and continues to be rooted in the \r\ninevitability of Israel\u0027s withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories \r\nthat were occupied by force and war, and in securing the legitimate national \r\nrights of the Palestinian people. \r\nThose in Israel who believe that total peace can be achieved without a \r\ncomplete Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories are gravely \r\nmistaken. Those who also believe that the Israeli arsenal of mass destruction \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Al-Shara. Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic) \r\nand its qualitative military edge can make it immune to the repercussions of \r\nthe end of the cold war are equally mistaken. Saturating Israel with \r\ndestructive and sophisticated weaponry cannot guarantee the true security of \r\nIsrael as long as it continues to occupy the territories of others by force \r\nand to violate the rights of the Palestinian people, and as long as it lacks \r\nthe human compass that may guide it to the shores of peace and security. \r\nThe road to a comprehensive, just and durable peace is clear and well \r\ndefined; it remains for Israel to choose to take it. Any manoeuvres of \r\npartial withdrawals or interim steps will not bring peace either to the region \r\nor to Israel itself. The higher level meetings Israel demands are merely a \r\nploy that is meant to undermine the framework and mechanism within which the \r\nArab and Israeli parties met at the Madrid Peace Conference. \r\nAs declared by its leader. President Hafez Al-Assad, Syria wants an \r\nhonourable peace which our people would accept, a peace in which not a grain \r\nof sand of our land is lost, no concession of any of our rights is made, and \r\nwithout deriliction of the duty of safeguarding the dignity of our nation. We \r\nwant the peace of the brave, the peace that survives and lasts and guarantees \r\nthe interests of all. But if there are to be games and ambushes no one could \r\nmake Syria forsake its patriotic and national stand. There is no place for \r\ncapitulation in our dictionary. \r\nWe have already voiced our readiness for a complete peace in return for a \r\ncomplete withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories and we reaffirm \r\nthat now. That is our challenge to Israel from this rostrum, a challenge that \r\nhas found no response to this day. \r\nA/47/PV. 14 \r\n43 \r\n(Mr. Al-Shara. Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic) \r\nIf comprehensiveness and justice were observed in arms control it would \r\nundoubtedly contribute to the consolidation of the security and stability we \r\nall long for. The subject of arms control would come within reach and be more \r\neffective in ensuring security and stability in the Middle East if it were \r\nbased on the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction, with nuclear \r\nweapons first and foremost, in accordance with criteria which have no bias in \r\nfavour of one State at the expense of another and which apply to all countries \r\nof the region without exception within the framework of the United Nations and \r\nunder its auspices. \r\nSyria has never spared any effort in supporting United Nations \r\nresolutions and conventions relating to disarmament, particularly the \r\nnon-proliferation Treaty to which Syria has acceded. Syria also signed the \r\nnon-proliferation Treaty safeguards agreement on 25 February 1992. Syria has \r\nsigned the Treaty on the prohibition of biological weapons and has \r\nconsistently supported the initiative to make the Middle East region free of \r\nall nuclear weapons. Syria was the first officially to suggest at the 1989 \r\nParis Conference on chemical weapons that the Middle East should be free of \r\nall chemical and biological weapons and weapons of mass destruction. \r\nAt a time when the whole world knows that Israel is the only State in the \r\nregion to possess nuclear weapons in addition to its possession of other \r\nweapons of mass destruction, Israel has to date refused to accede to the \r\nnon-proliferation Treaty and has also refused for decades to allow inspection \r\nof its nuclear installations and continues to do so today. \r\nThe logical option for all peoples of the world is to ensure security for \r\nall through complete disarmament and the elimination of all weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. The measures adopted by the Conference on Disarmament in \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n44-45 \r\n(Mr. Al-Shara. Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic) \r\nrelation to the conclusion of a draft convention on the prohibition, \r\ndevelopment, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and their \r\ndestruction will remain short of realizing the ambitions of the international \r\ncommunity so long as they are not coupled with a similar prohibition on \r\nnuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. \r\nThe situation in South Africa continues to be a source of deep concern \r\nfor my country. While we express our satisfaction over the repeal and \r\namendment of some of the basic laws of apartheid, we would also like to \r\nexpress our deep concern over the persistence of repression and violence that \r\nthe Government of South Africa continues to perpetrate against the population, \r\nat a great cost in victims to that population. Syria strongly supports the \r\ndemands of the overwhelming majority of the people of South Africa for the \r\nestablishment of a democratic and non-racial society. \r\nConcerning Cyprus, we welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General to \r\nfind a just and lasting solution to the Cypriot problem based on United \r\nNations resolutions and taking into account the interests of the parties to \r\nthe conflict. \r\nConcerning the Korean peninsula, we reaffirm our support for the efforts \r\nof Democratic Korea to reunite the Korean peninsula peacefully and through \r\nnegotiations. This would lead to prosperity for the entire Korean people \r\nwhile consolidating peace and stability in North-East Asia. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n46 \r\n(Mr. Al-Shara. Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic) \r\nIn view of all the issues and problems with which the international \r\ncommunity is occupied, some of which I have mentioned in my statement, the \r\npeoples and countries of the world are looking to our international \r\nOrganization to contribute towards the establishment of a world of peace and \r\nsecurity. We believe that, in order to be able to realize the aspirations and \r\nhopes of the peoples of the world for instituting a new world order in which \r\nthere is no aggression or occupation and which is based on international \r\nlegality and the rules of international law, the United Nations must apply the \r\nprovisions of its own Charter and implement its resolutions without bias, \r\nselectivity or double standards. As we find ourselves on the threshold of the \r\ntwenty-first century, we hope to be able to reach a world of peace and justice \r\nin which stability and prosperity would prevail. \r\nADDRESS BY THE HONOURABLE MR. EDWARD FENECH-ADAMI, PRIME MINISTER OF THE \r\nREPBULIC OF MALTA \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Malta. \r\nMr. Edward Fenech-Adami. Prime Minister of the Republic of Malta, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have great pleasure in welcoming the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Malta, the Honourable Mr. Edward Fenech-Adami, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\nMr. FENECH-ADAMI (Malta): It is with a special sense of \r\nsatisfaction that I wish to congratulate Mr. Ganev on his unanimous election \r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. His \r\ncountry, Bulgaria, is a protagonist in an exhilarating democratization and \r\nliberalization process that is transforming a whole region and has already \r\nushered in a new era in international relations. It is therefore most \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Fenech-Adami. Malta) \r\nappropriate that, as a representative of his country and his region, he should \r\nbe presiding over the General Assembly in these momentous and challenging \r\ntimes. \r\nThe exceptional nature of our times is reflected in the fact that over \r\nthe last eight months 13 countries have become Members of the United Nations. \r\nWe welcome these new Members, many of which are a direct product of the \r\ndramatic developments of the last few years. Their membership constitutes a \r\nfurther welcome affirmation of the universality of our Organisation. \r\nIn January this year a new Secretary-General took over the charge of the \r\nUnited Nations. His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali is a most respected \r\nand long-time friend of Malta. He has brought an impressive dose of energy \r\nand intellectual force to the task of restructuring the United Nations on the \r\nsolid foundations left by his predecessor. The international community is \r\nindeed most fortunate in having individuals of such high calibre and \r\ndedication consistently in its service. \r\nBold and far-sighted leadership is of critical importance at the present \r\njuncture of international relations. Ours is a time when major challenges and \r\nexceptional opportunities compete with each other for attention and action; a \r\ntime when hope, rather than fear, colours humanity\u0027s vision of its future - a \r\nvision which places the individual at the centre of all activity and which \r\nsees as an ultimate and cherished objective the creation of a just and \r\nprosperous community of nations living in peace and harmony with each other. \r\nEvents over the past 12 months have brought home the reality that the \r\ndemise of the cold war did not automatically usher in the era of uninterrupted \r\npeace, stability and prosperity to which we are all aspiring. Vast problems \r\nstill remain in the political, social and economic spheres, and at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels. What is new today is the \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n48 \r\n(Mr. Fenech-Adami. Malta) \r\npossibility for the whole international community to consider these problems \r\nas a shared burden standing in the path of a common vision. We therefore \r\nstrive for their resolution on the basis of practical cooperation rather than \r\nseek to exploit them divisively in the framework of ideological confrontation. \r\nAt first glance, the emerging world order presents a dark tapestry of \r\nrekindled ethnic and national rivalries, massive economic disparities, \r\nextensive and irreversible environmental degradation, and horrific instances \r\nof human suffering. In the context of what is happening in the former \r\nYugoslavia, in Somalia, and elsewhere, it may indeed sound ironic to identify \r\nthe spirit of cooperation as the touchstone of this new world order. \r\nYet these unprecedented problems of our times have also generated an \r\nunprecedented determination for cooperative action at both the regional and \r\nthe global levels. In cases like Yugoslavia and Somalia, the efforts so far \r\nundertaken have fallen far short of the needs. Yet the international \r\ncommunity persists in its collective endeavour to achieve a peaceful solution \r\nof these problems. In this it finds encouragement in the progress being \r\nachieved elsewhere, especially in Cambodia, in Central America and in Angola. \r\nA few days ago Malta joined a large majority of the United Nations \r\nmembership in deciding to deny the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Serbia and \r\nMontenegro its claim to succeed the former Socialist Federal Republic of \r\nYugoslavia, and consequently in calling upon it to reapply for United Nations \r\nmembership in conformity with the provisions of the Charter. We did so in the \r\nlight of our shared abhorrence of the atrocities that are taking place in the \r\nregion of former Yugoslavia. \r\nIn the Middle East, the peace process launched in Madrid last year \r\ncontinues upon its fragile but persistent path. In South Africa, the hopes \r\nfor an early and peaceful dismantlement of the policy of apartheid have ebbed \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n49-50 \r\n(Mr. Fenech-Adami. Malta) \r\nand flowed in recent months in the wake of alternately encouraging and tragic \r\nevents. In these instances too, however, the collective determination of the \r\ninternational community to promote a peaceful and lasting resolution of \r\nlong-standing problems, on the basis of principles contained in relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions, is pre-eminent. Equally steadfast is the \r\ncollective determination to bring peace and justice to other still-troubled \r\npeoples around the globe, in particular the peoples of Cyprus, of Afghanistan \r\nand of Mozambique. \r\nIn the year of the Rio Conference we are perhaps particularly conscious \r\nof the fact that the equitable and sustainable economic and social development \r\nof all peoples is not only a major objective in its own right; it is an \r\nindivisible component of international peace and security. The sharp economic \r\nand social disparities which continue to intensify, both within and among \r\nnations, pose a direct challenge to the hopes for peace and security raised by \r\nthe emerging new order in international relations. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. Fenech-Adami. Malta) \r\nThere is growing recognition of the fact that an approach to these \r\nproblems must be rooted in the notion of global economic interdependence a \r\nnotion that must inspire concrete action at the global, as well as at the \r\nregional, level on such questions as international trade, financial flows, \r\ntransfer of technology and debt relief. Major projects of regional \r\ncooperation, such as those that are taking place in North America, Western \r\nEurope and South-East Asia should therefore be conceived of as stepping-stones \r\ntowards increased trade and economic cooperation at the global level, rather \r\nthan as attempts to create a set of monolithic and competing trading blocs in \r\ndifferent parts of the world. \r\nA successful and balanced outcome of the Uruguay Round of multilateral \r\ntrade negotiations would go a long way towards providing the necessary \r\ndefences against any insidious and harmful fragmentation of world trade. \r\nThe disappearance of super-Power confrontation has perhaps had its most \r\ndirect and visible impact in the field of disarmament. At the bilateral \r\nlevel, there have already been significant reductions in the nuclear and \r\nconventional arsenals of the two major Powers. The prospects for an \r\nindefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\nand for a comprehensive test-ban treaty are encouraging. At its current \r\nsession the General Assembly will be considering a draft convention for a \r\ncomprehensive ban on chemical armaments, including their means of delivery, \r\nwhich has been finalized by the Conference on Disarmament. \r\nMalta welcomes these developments and expresses the hope that they are \r\nthe precursors to further cuts in strategic arsenals, especially as regards \r\nweapons of mass destruction, thereby releasing resources to be used for \r\nmuch-needed development purposes. At the same time, however, we should not \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. Fenech-Adami. Malta) \r\nlose sight of other, less rosy, aspects of the disarmament question, that now, \r\nmore than before, assume greater relevance in the context of efforts towards \r\nreducing tensions and enhancing international security. This is the case in \r\nparticular with regard to regional disarmament. \r\nThe proliferation of armaments, conventional or otherwise, at the \r\nregional level is a matter of serious concern. It is a factor that directly \r\nand negatively affects security and stability at both regional and broader \r\nlevels. At the same time, it absorbs scarce resources that could otherwise be \r\nutilized for economic and social development. \r\nThe European experience, through the Conference on Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE), has been that the progressive reduction of \r\nmutual suspicion through the adoption of confidence- and security-building \r\nmeasures plays a significant role in creating the necessary conditions for \r\ndisarmament at the regional level. Transparency is an important aspect of \r\nconfidence-building. \r\nIn this context, the setting up by the General Assembly last year of the \r\nRegister of Conventional Arms was an important first step, which Malta had \r\nindeed advocated as far back as the late 1960s. It is hoped that this \r\ninitiative will be followed up, within the various regions, by determined \r\nefforts towards other concrete measures of confidence building. \r\nThe United Nations system is today being called upon to play a \r\ndetermining role in a vast and bewildering array of problems. Our \r\nOrganization was originally conceived in the perspective of global \r\ncooperation, not of super-Power confrontation. After a 45-year gap, it is \r\nonly now, with the dawning of an era of cooperation, that it can therefore \r\nbegin to operate fully in pursuit of its essential vocation for peace and \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Fenech-Adami. Malta) \r\nunderstanding among nations. It is essential that we all play our part in \r\nensuring that it has the necessary resources, and appropriate structures, to \r\nfulfil its tasks. \r\nThe original United Nations structures combine the principle of equality \r\nwith the pragmatic differentiation of roles and responsibilities arising from \r\ndifferent capabilities and historical circumstances. In the field of peace \r\nand international security, the two complementary poles of the United Nations \r\nsystem are the General Assembly and the Security Council. A dynamic \r\nrelationship between these two organs remains the prerequisite for the \r\ncredible and effective functioning of the United Nations in the field of peace \r\nand international security. \r\nMany of the issues related to these matters have been impressively \r\nexamined in two reports prepared by the Secretary-General during the course of \r\nthis year. The first is the report entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\". The \r\nsecond is his first annual report to the General Assembly. These reports \r\ncontain a wealth of new ideas and proposals dealing with the evolving role of \r\nthe United Nations in preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping, and \r\nthe promotion of economic and social development. These ideas provide us with \r\nan excellent stimulus to rethink the role that the United Nations can and \r\nneeds to play if the end of the cold war is to become the beginning of a \r\nconstructive peace. \r\nIn his reports, the Secretary-General also pays special attention to \r\nregional cooperation, which is increasingly being seen as a useful, indeed a \r\nnecessary, complement to multilateral action at the global level. \r\nPerhaps what is most needed in this regard is that regional and global \r\nactions be better harmonized and made to dovetail into each other. This is \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n54 \r\n(Mr. Fenech-Adami. Malta) \r\none reason why Malta proposed to the CSCE and the proposal was endorsed at \r\nthe Helsinki summit in July that the CSCE be designated as a regional \r\narrangement under Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. \r\nLikewise, Malta has been urging for some years that the provisions for \r\nthe establishment of technology development centres related to regional seas \r\nenvisaged in the Convention on the Law of the Sea be put into effect in such \r\nobvious contexts as the Mediterranean, the Caribbean and the South Pacific. \r\nWe have also urged that these functional centres should illustrate the new \r\nconcepts of governance that have emerged as most appropriate to the new world \r\norder that is, their governing bodies should include not only \r\nrepresentatives of States, but also non-governmental bodies, whether set up on \r\na national or on a plurinational basis. Such centres would be geared both to \r\nencouraging the transfer of technology and also, and perhaps more important, \r\nto promoting co-development of new, locally adapted technology. \r\nAs a European country, Malta seeks to participate as actively as possible \r\nin the many-faceted and far-reaching initiatives for regional cooperation that \r\nare unfolding on the European continent. Recent developments in our region \r\nhave injected new life and vigour into longstanding institutions such as the \r\nCouncil of Europe and the Economic Commission for Europe, whose pioneering \r\nrole in many areas of economic and social development at the regional level \r\nhas always been recognized. From the darkest days of the cold war, the CSCE \r\nsought its vocation in the merging of the strict issues of disarmament with \r\nthe wider aspects of cooperation in the economic, social and humanitarian \r\nfields. For nearly four decades the European Community has slowly and \r\npainstakingly forged a path towards regional economic and political \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n55 \r\n(Mr. Fenech-Adami. Malta) \r\nintegration which, in spite of the present difficulties, represents the best \r\nguarantee for a secure and prosperous future for all the peoples of this \r\nhistorically troubled continent. \r\nMalta sees in its aspiration to become a full member of the European \r\nCommunity a natural culmination of its European identity and of the role it \r\nhas played over the years in promoting European cooperation, within the \r\nCouncil of Europe, the Economic Commission for Europe and the CSCE. For us, \r\nmembership of the European Community is an overriding political objective \r\nfounded upon the conviction that such membership offers us the best prospects \r\nfor political, economic and social development while permitting us to play our \r\nrightful role in a unique experiment for regional integration. \r\nA/47/PV. 14 \r\n56 \r\n(Mr. Fenech-Adami. Malta) \r\nOur geographical location in the centre of the Mediterranean has also \r\nmade us conscious of the issues which were so effectively highlighted at this \r\nyear\u0027s United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, notably the \r\nawareness of the fragility of our planet Earth and the intimate relationship \r\nthat exists between human development and ecological stability. The General \r\nAssembly at this session has an important task in following up the decisions \r\ntaken at Rio, with regard both to the implementation of the proposals and \r\nrecommendations contained in Agenda 21 and also to the establishment of the \r\nnew commission for sustainable development. \r\nIn this context, Malta shares the view that, in the endeavour to \r\nrestructure and adapt the United Nations system better to deal with the issues \r\nof the new world order, a revitalized role could be found for the Trusteeship \r\nCouncil as a guardian of the common heritage of future generations, to replace \r\nits fast disappearing role as trustee of dependent Territories. \r\nOver the 28 years of its United Nations membership, Malta has taken \r\nparticular pride in identifying its commitment to multilateralism, especially \r\nthrough its many initiatives on issues related to the environment as it \r\nconstitutes a common concern of mankind. It is worth noting that this year \r\nmarks the twenty-fifth anniversary of Malta\u0027s proposal to the General Assembly \r\nthat the seabed and ocean floor be reserved exclusively in the interests of \r\nmankind. Also this year we have been gratified to see our latest initiative, \r\nrelated to the protection of climate for present and future generations, \r\nresulting in the signing of the Framework Convention on Climate Change by over \r\n150 nations. We earnestly hope that the ratification of the Convention will \r\nproceed quickly to ensure its early coming into force. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Fenech-Adami. Malta) \r\nThe basic starting-point and the goal of our activities is the well-being \r\nof the individual in society. The importance of the human dimension in all \r\nour endeavours should not and cannot be underestimated. It is in this context \r\nthat Malta attaches fundamental importance to issues of human rights. Over \r\nthe years, the United Nations has elaborated major instruments relating to \r\nhuman rights, starting with the Universal Declaration and leading up to the \r\nCovenants on civil and political, economic, social and cultural rights, and \r\nthe Convention against torture, to all of which Malta is a party. \r\nCollective action aimed at ensuring the effective protection of the \r\nrights enshrined in these documents should not, in our view, be unduly \r\nconstrained by arguments over issues of national sovereignty. We believe that \r\nthe Commission on Human Rights and other relevant bodies should have their \r\nmandates enlarged beyond their present monitoring role along the lines of the \r\nrelevant institutions within the Council of Europe. We look forward to the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Human Rights due to be held in Vienna next year, \r\nin the hope that effective and bold steps will be taken in the endeavour \r\nfurther to safeguard and guarantee the fullest possible enjoyment of human \r\nrights at the individual level throughout the world. \r\nThis year the General Assembly will be holding special commemorations on \r\nthe conclusion of the Decade for Disabled Persons and on the tenth anniversary \r\nof the adoption of the International Action Plan for the Elderly. Over the \r\nyears, Malta has taken an active role on the question of the elderly and the \r\naged, a subject^which it first brought to the attention of the General \r\nAssembly in the late 1960s. Today Malta hosts an International Institute on \r\nAging that plays a leading role in the promotion of new ideas and training in \r\nthe field of ageing. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr. Fenech-Adami. Malta) \r\n1995, the year marking the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, \r\nwill be devoted to two important conferences relating to social development \r\nthe World Summit on Social Development and the Fourth World Conference on \r\nWomen. We welcome these, together with the 1994 International Conference on \r\nPopulation and Development, as a further indication of the growing commitment \r\nof our Organization to the importance of the human dimension in international \r\ncooperation a commitment which has been reinforced by the recent creation of \r\nthe Office of Humanitarian Affairs within the Secretariat and which, as our \r\nSecretary-General so eloquently states in his report to the General Assembly, \r\nis renewed daily through the quiet heroism of the many individuals working in \r\nthe field under the aegis of the United Nations throughout the globe. \r\nIn spite of the many difficulties and recognized weaknesses, we all \r\nacknowledge how fortunate our generation is in its possession of such a global \r\norganization as the United Nations, founded upon a Charter which encapsulates \r\nthe highest and most lasting ideals of humankind. It is my privilege to take \r\nthis opportunity to rededicate the commitment of the Government and people of \r\nMalta to the United Nations. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe Prime Minister of the Republic of Malta for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Edward Fenech-Adami. Prime Minister of the Republic of Malta, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\nMr. ACHARYA (Nepal): I have the pleasure to extend to Mr. Ganev the \r\nwarm congratulations of the delegation of Nepal on his unanimous election to \r\nthe presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We are \r\nhappy to have an eminent person like him, with wide experience and skill, to \r\nguide our deliberations at this particularly important stage in the history of \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n59-60 \r\n(Mr. Acharya. Nepal) \r\nthe United Nations. I take this opportunity to express the great appreciation \r\nof my delegation to Mr. Samir Shihabi, who presided over the forty-sixth \r\nsession with great distinction. \r\nI should also like to pay a tribute to our Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his dedication to the ideals of the United \r\nNations. His statesmanship and wise leadership are crucial in our collective \r\nefforts towards realizing the vision of the Charter. \r\nThe pace of change in the world has presented humanity both with promises \r\nand with challenges. The events of the last few years have underlined the \r\nuniversal applicability of the Charter of the United Nations. Its validity as \r\na universal guide has withstood the test of time and flux. Confidence in the \r\nOrganization as the central agency for upholding the rule of law and as a \r\nforum for harmonizing the actions of nations has never been greater. We have \r\nseen a united international community, acting on the precepts of the Charter, \r\novercome an act of aggression. After decades of paralysis, the Security \r\nCouncil is functioning as envisaged in the Charter. Efforts to revitalize the \r\nrole of the United Nations in the economic and social fields have gained \r\nmomentum. This unparalleled resurgence of faith in the United Nations is best \r\nsymbolized in the admission of 20 new Members in a single year. We are closer \r\nthan ever before to the cherished goal of universal membership. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n61 \r\n(Mr. Acharya. Nepal) \r\nA period of rapid changes is also a period of uncertainties. The old \r\nglobal order has passed but the new order is still very fluid. At this \r\nthreshold of a new era in international life, we have a broad framework for a \r\nbetter future in the Charter of this Organization. The challenge before the \r\nUnited Nations is to harness the new mood and dynamism in international life \r\nand bring them to bear on the global problems facing mankind. It is the \r\nchallenge to seize the opportunity to end war, to protect the dignity and \r\nworth of the individual, to ensure freedom and the rule of law and to promote \r\neconomic development. In an interdependent world, the United Nations is \r\nindispensable for international cooperation. \r\nThe task is by no means simple. In one single year, there have been \r\nupheavals of epic proportion: the break-up of political entities of long \r\nstanding and brutal ethnic and religious wars. Narrow nationalism is \r\nthreatening the norms of a stable international order. The cost in terms of \r\nhuman suffering has been appalling. The horrors of Somalia and of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina force us to ask if we, the peoples of the United Nations, are \r\nreally determined to combine our strength to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity. The persistence of widespread poverty and destitution forces us to \r\nask if we are indeed resolved to employ international machinery for the \r\neconomic and social advancement of all peoples. \r\nThe historic summit-level meeting of the Security Council in January this \r\nyear was an important landmark in the search for answers to these and other \r\nquestions. That meeting launched a serious search for new ideas and provided \r\nan impetus to meet new situations in the world. As the Secretary-General has \r\npointed out, the tumultuous events of the last few years have already driven \r\nhome several lessons: the need for democratization at the national level with \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Acharya. Nepal) \r\na corresponding process at the global level; the defence of human rights, \r\nincluding minority rights and the right to development; the need for new ways \r\nto prevent internal and inter-State confrontations, including the increasing \r\nuse of regional arrangements; and universal acceptance of the rule of law \r\ntranscending changing perceptions of expediency. \r\nThese observations form the core of the Secretary-General\u0027s report, \"An \r\nAgenda for Peace\". Several of the Secretary-General\u0027s recommendations can and \r\nshould be implemented immediately. These relate to the more effective use of \r\nthe traditional forms of peace-keeping, the safety of peace-keeping personnel, \r\nand the finances involved. His recommendation for greater resort to \r\nfact-finding missions is equally pertinent. Some other recommendations raise \r\nfundamental issues related to the perception of an international organization, \r\nits role vis-a-vis State sovereignty, and the role of the Secretary-General \r\nhimself. My delegation looks forward to a full-scale discussion of this \r\nimportant document during the present session. \r\nIt is obvious that there is today a greater need for the United Nations \r\nto address itself more seriously to the great divide between the rich and poor \r\nnations. This, along with the universalization of a human rights regime, is a \r\nfundamental issue of the new era. \r\nAs a least developed country, Nepal accepts the principal responsibility \r\nfor its economic and social development. Our development policies are \r\ndirected towards creating a basic infrastructure for development. Human \r\nresources development is a priority with us. We consider it extremely \r\nimportant to improve the living conditions of our people, to raise the level \r\nof literacy, improve basic health and nutrition, and reduce the rate of infant \r\nmortality. We are committed to these goals because we believe that it is the \r\nhuman being and not the State which has the ultimate right to development. We \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. Acharya. Nepal) \r\nfully share the view that these goals can be attained only in a society that \r\nis committed to the inalienable right of its people to elect their own leaders \r\nin free and honest exercise of their will. We have already put in place the \r\nfoundations necessary to achieve these objectives. Principal among them are \r\nthe constitutional guarantee of political pluralism, the rule of law, the \r\nindependence of the judiciary, and safeguards for human rights. We now have \r\nthe legal framework to enable people locally to take primary responsibility \r\nfor their own development. With the basic political and legal grounds in \r\nplace, I wish to reiterate our appeal for measures to reach the targets set \r\nout in the programme of action adopted by the Second United Nations Conference \r\non the Least Developed Countries. While expressing deep gratitude for the \r\ngenerous assistance we have been receiving from donor countries and \r\nmultilateral agencies, we look forward to increased cooperation to complement \r\nour own efforts to meet the needs of the poorest of our poor. \r\nIt is now universally recognized that, if development is to be possible, \r\nthe life-sustaining ecological systems must be preserved, and that development \r\nalone can make it possible to safeguard the environment. It is imperative to \r\nimprove the living conditions of the poor in developing countries so that they \r\nare not forced to destroy the ecological basis of their children\u0027s future to \r\nmeet the immediate challenges of sheer survival. The United Nations \r\nConference on Environment and Development held in June this year was the most \r\npotent expression of global interdependence. The Conference has established \r\nthat developing countries need to mobilize their own resources for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. It obliges developing countries to take global environmental \r\nconsequences into consideration in their development planning. It has also \r\nestablished the right of developing countries to development. It has \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n64 \r\n(Mr. Acharya. Nepal) \r\nunderscored the need for the transfer of additional resources and technology \r\nfrom industrialized countries to enable developing countries to fulfil their \r\nresponsibility to safeguard the environment for present and future \r\ngenerations. Equally important, the Conference has established that developed \r\ncountries need to reduce the great burden they impose on the environment. The \r\nRio Declaration and Agenda 21 place people at the centre of concern. \r\nAgenda 21, with its far-reaching implications, can be the centerpiece of a \r\nmutually beneficial international cooperation. Nepal sincerely hopes that the \r\nphilosophical commitment of Rio will be followed through and strengthened. We \r\nhope that establishing a high-level commission on sustainable development will \r\nreceive the utmost priority it deserves during this session of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\nWhile speaking of international cooperation in economic and social \r\nfields, I appreciate the ongoing efforts to enable the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil to play the role envisioned in the Charter. Political justice will \r\nmean little if the health and happiness of people, especially those in \r\ndeveloping countries, are ignored. Indeed, global economic and social \r\ndevelopment alone can constitute the lasting foundation of international peace \r\nand security. We welcome the serious and out-of-the-ordinary approach of the \r\n1992 session of the Council as the first tangible move towards restructuring \r\nset in motion by General Assembly resolution 45/264. The holding of the first \r\nhigh-level segment of a regular session of the Council was a promising \r\nbeginning. Also important was the examination of operational activities \r\nincluding the workings of organs and agencies of the United Nations family in \r\neconomic and social fields. The times call for an integrated approach to \r\neconomic and social issues in the field as well as at headquarters. They \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n65 \r\n(Mr. Acharva. Nepal) \r\ndemand that we avoid inter-agency competition, duplication and waste of \r\nlimited resources by improving coordination among agencies, including the \r\nBretton Woods institutions. My delegation has noted with appreciation the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s determination to pursue restructuring of the Secretariat \r\nto meet these larger goals. \r\nOne of the most satisfying reforms undertaken during the last year has \r\nbeen in the area of coordinating humanitarian assistance. My delegation \r\nwelcomes the establishment of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs and \r\nexpresses its warm appreciation to Under-Secretary-General \r\nAmbassador Jan Eliasson for his good leadership. We have already seen several \r\nexamples of effective balance between principles and operational guidelines, \r\nimproved coordination and governance. The situations in Somalia and the \r\nformer Yugoslavia present unique tests of international commitment in this \r\narea. Indeed, it might not be too far-fetched to visualize the operation of \r\neffective humanitarian emergency assistance and the equally important roles of \r\nfollow-up rehabilitation and development phases as new arms of the United \r\nNations in preventive diplomacy and peacemaking. \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n66 \r\n(Mr. Acharya. Nepal) \r\nThe relationship between freedom and democracy, on the one hand, and \r\npeace and stability, on the other, needs no reiteration. Nepal rejoices in \r\nthe resurgence of democracy in various parts of the world in recent years. We \r\nstrongly support this trend, which we believe to be in full conformity with \r\nthe purposes of the United Nations. Developments in recent years have made it \r\nclear that, without respect for human rights, other achievements will have \r\nlittle meaning. The starting-point of democracy is the recognition and worth \r\nof each human individual. Respect for human rights alone makes freedom \r\nmeaningful. The protection and promotion of human rights are becoming a \r\ncommon basis for international cooperation. Respect for human rights is an \r\nessential condition for the conduct of international relations in a spirit of \r\nopenness, trust and confidence. The realization by many peoples within \r\nwell-established political entities of their right to self-determination has \r\nraised the complex question of the rights of minorities. Clearly, absolute \r\nself-determination of each minority would have unforeseen consequences for the \r\nsystem of international relations. Clearly, multi-ethnicity, cultural and \r\nreligious pluralism would continue to enrich most of the nations of the \r\nworld. However, it is a duty incumbent on governments to ensure that members \r\nof minority groups are guaranteed the full enjoyment of the basic human rights \r\ncommon to all. It is also a duty incumbent on governments to ensure special \r\nprotection when needed. The current upheavals in various parts of the world \r\nunderscore the need for the United Nations to work out principles that can \r\nserve as common points of reference for the peaceful resolution of conflicting \r\naspirations. \r\nThe historic Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, unilateral disarmament \r\ndecisions taken by the United States and the Russian Federation, and the \r\nagreement reached between the two countries this summer are crucial steps \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n67 \r\n(Mr. Acharya. Nepal) \r\ntowards lower levels of armaments and greater security. There is an \r\noverwhelming consensus today that the opportunity provided by the uniquely \r\nfavourable international relations must be seized in order to achieve a \r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. Events in the Persian Gulf have made the \r\nnon-proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction the subject \r\nof global focus. My delegation sincerely hopes that at this session the \r\nGeneral Assembly will be able to adopt the long-awaited Convention on chemical \r\nweapons, the first comprehensive international instrument to outlaw a whole \r\nclass of weapons of mass destruction. In this context, Nepal welcomes the \r\nrecent agreement between our two neighbours, India and Pakistan, on chemical \r\nweapons. \r\nWe have been following events in the territory of the former Socialist \r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia with utmost concern. The use of brute force \r\nagainst the civilian population, especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina, has \r\nbeen appalling. We find the policy of forced mass expulsion abhorrent. We \r\ncannot accept the use of force to change internal or external borders. Nepal \r\njoins in the international demand that parties to the conflict respond \r\nimmediately to the successive resolutions of the Security Council. We appeal \r\nto the European Community to redouble its efforts, in cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations, to seek a negotiated settlement of the crisis in the Balkans. \r\nNepal welcomed the extraordinary session of the Commission on Human Rights \r\ndevoted to Yugoslavia. We look forward to the report of the Secretary-General \r\non the findings of the Special Rapporteur on allegations of grave violations \r\nof human rights throughout the former Yugoslavia. We pay a tribute to the \r\npersonnel of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), the United \r\nNations humanitarian agencies and the International Committee of the Red \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n68 \r\n(Mr. Acharya. Nepal) \r\nCross, which have been doing an outstanding job in the most difficult \r\ncircumstances. \r\nMy delegation reiterates its full support for the territorial integrity \r\nand non-aligned character of Cyprus. We hope that the October round of talks \r\nunder the good offices of the Secretary-General will produce the desired \r\nresults. \r\nNepal has welcomed the implementation of the United Nations plan for \r\nCambodia. We reiterate our appeal to all Cambodian parties to cooperate fully \r\nwith the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) for the \r\nsuccessful conclusion of this important United Nations mission. I take this \r\nopportunity to express my Government\u0027s appreciation to Mr. Yasushi Akashi, \r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General, for the great efforts he has \r\nbeen making to ensure the successful implementation of the plan for Cambodia. \r\nWe are following with keen interest talks between North and South Korea, \r\nnow fellow Members of the United Nations. We sincerely hope that these \r\nbilateral talks will facilitate the fulfilment of the wishes of the Korean \r\npeople for peaceful national reunification. \r\nNepal is gravely concerned over the violence and the deaths of innocent \r\ncivilians in Kabul. We appeal to the various Afghan factions to end the cycle \r\nof violence and to engage in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the \r\nwar-torn country. \r\nEvents of the past year have not diminished the urgency of finding a \r\nsolution to the Middle East conflict on the basis of Security Council \r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Israel and the Palestinian people must \r\nrecognize each other\u0027s rights: the right of the Palestinian people to \r\nself-determination, including their right to form a State of their own, and \r\nthe right of Israel to exist within secure and internationally recognized \r\nA/47/PV.14 \r\n69-70 \r\n(Mr. Acharya. Nepal) \r\nborders. The Government of Nepal strongly supports the continuing efforts of \r\nthe sponsoring Powers of the Middle East peace process to bring about a \r\nnegotiated settlement of the crisis. \r\nSouth Africa is today at a critical juncture. Negotiations thus far have \r\nindicated that difficulties in the establishment of a united non-racial \r\ndemocratic South Africa are not insurmountable. Violence should not be \r\nallowed to dampen hopes for a peaceful end of apartheid. \r\nMy delegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-General and the \r\nendorsement by the Security Council of his proposal for involvement of the \r\nUnited Nations in order to put the dialogue on track again. My delegation \r\nhopes that the Pretoria regime will respond positively to the proposals \r\ncontained in the report, expecially those relating to ending the violence. \r\nAs I said at the beginning of my statement, the vision of the Charter is \r\nmore valid today than ever before. It is, however, clear that models and \r\npolicies of the past are not adequate to meet today\u0027s global issues. The \r\nmagnitude and severity of economic and social problems in many countries of \r\nthe world today are unprecedented. The emergence of the Security Council as \r\nthe central instrument for the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity, as intended by the Charter, is a welcome development. The United \r\nNations must seize this historic opportunity to promote with equal vigour and \r\nurgency international cooperation in the economic and social fields. The \r\nprecepts of the Charter should be our guide in bringing in a new era of \r\ninternational relations. This family of nations must strive to create a world \r\nwhere all people are entitled to political freedom, economic and social \r\njustice, a clean environment and full human rights. \r\nThe meeting rose at 12.40 p.m. \r\n"
