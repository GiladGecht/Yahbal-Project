GUILLERMO ENDARA GALIMANY, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will first hear an address by the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Panama. \r\nMr. Guillermo Endara Galimanv. President of the Republic of Panama, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic of Panama, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Guillermo Endara Galimany, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\nPresident ENDARA GALIMANY (Panama) (interpretation from Spanish): I \r\nconsider it a great honour to speak before the General Assembly of the United \r\nNations once again. On behalf of the people and the Government of the \r\nRepublic of Panama, I wish to extend heartfelt congratulations to General \r\nAssembly President Stoyan Ganev, whose election has been a tribute to his \r\nrecord and personal merits and a wise choice by the General Assembly. \r\nBefore continuing, I should also like to express my country\u0027s pleasure at \r\nthe election of the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and at the \r\nsplendid work he has done in the few months during which he has been at his \r\nsensitive position. We are certain that, under his leadership, the necessary \r\nconsensus will be achieved to implement concrete actions that will promote \r\npolitical and economic stability, human and social development, and the \r\nrestoration of belief in the principles that gave rise to this Organization. \r\nToday, because of the positive changes that have taken place in the world \r\nchanges that have been called the \"new order\" those principles are \r\nsingularly valid. We most definitely support his \"Agenda for Peace\". \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n3 \r\n(President Endara Galimany) \r\nWithout any doubt, the end of the cold war offers the world new and great \r\nopportunities to devote efforts and additional resources to the social and \r\neconomic activities of our countries rather than to the waging of war. We \r\nnote with satisfaction the progress made in various parts of the world through \r\njoint efforts to promote peace, security, and cooperation. \r\nThe experience of the people of the Republic of El Salvador constitutes, \r\nfor the rest of mankind, an example of how to settle disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans. With the signing of the peace agreements in the nation, an end was put \r\nto 12 long, grim years of struggle, bloodshed, grief, and suffering for \r\nthousands of Salvadorian homes. That is why my country, like the rest of the \r\ninternational community, reiterates its commitment to help the Salvadorian \r\npeople consolidate peace, an indispensable element in the economic, political, \r\nand social recovery of that fraternal country. \r\nIn the same vein, the recent conclusion of the century-old border \r\nconflict between Honduras and El Salvador, after the accepted ruling of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, puts an end to one stage and begins another \r\nmarked by understanding and friendship between those two countries. My \r\nGovernment welcomes this renewed willingness to resolve disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans. \r\nIn those areas where, sadly, wars are unfolding, action must be taken not \r\nonly to combat the scourge of war but also to fight its causes. Panama \r\nsupports the machinery aimed at preventive action by United Nations \r\npeace-keeping forces in regions of hostility, in particular the implementation \r\nof preventive diplomacy and the peace programme put forward by the \r\nSecretary-General. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n4 \r\n(President Endara Galimany) \r\nIn the area of regional disarmament, Panama, under the Treaty of \r\nTlatelolco and recent proposed amendments to it, and as a signatory to the \r\nAyacucho Declaration, has made a commitment to cooperate in efforts in this \r\ndirection, as well as in efforts to ban nuclear weapons and eliminate \r\nconventional arms in Latin America. Taking into account the concepts of peace \r\nand stability, our country has truly and effectively abolished the army and is \r\nin the process of introducing constitutional reforms that will make it \r\nimpossible to re-establish any kind of military organization in Panama. If \r\nthe Panamanian people supports this plan in the referendum next November, we \r\nwill be - together with Costa Rica two American countries whose constitution \r\nand laws ban the existence of an army. In this way we will have eliminated \r\nthe possibility of re-establishing military regimes, of sorry memory, that did \r\nsuch harm throughout the history of Panama. \r\nBoth domestically and internationally, we are in favour of diverting \r\nresources that have hitherto been assigned to military activities\u0027towards \r\nefforts to promote the economic and social development of the people and the \r\nprotection of the environment. If the great and powerful of this world have \r\ncome to understand the necessity of reducing military spending, then there is \r\neven more reason for the smaller countries to understand that our wars must be \r\nwars against poverty and illiteracy. \r\nThere can be no doubt that the Rio Conference marked the beginning of a \r\nnew stage in a new form of development for the world and its inhabitants. We \r\nmust harmonize the economic, social, political, and ecological dimensions. \r\nThe concepts of sustainable development and integration are key elements in \r\nbuilding the future of our world above and beyond the boundaries and \r\nindividual interests of nations. But, at the same time, the equity that can \r\nbe produced by development must be an important topic on our agendas. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n5 \r\n(President Endara Galimanv) \r\nPanama accepts the challenge to shift development patterns and attitudes \r\ntowards the natural environment. In this regard, we need the determined \r\ncooperation of the international community to preserve the biogenetic heritage \r\nthat has been bequeathed to us. I reiterate that we need to create a special \r\nfund to give the developing countries new and additional resources enabling \r\nthem to implement national strategies of sustainable development. At the same \r\ntime, it is necessary to make joint efforts to bring together Governments and \r\nthe private sector with international organizations in an effort to achieve \r\nthese ends. To that end, we should look to the results of the Rio Conference \r\nas a great opportunity to pledge efforts and resources at all levels and to \r\nformulate and implement national development strategies based upon Agenda 21. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n6 \r\n(President Endara Galimany) \r\nIn my first address in this forum, two years ago, I referred specifically \r\nto our support for the incorporation of the Republic of Korea into the United \r\nNations, which we saw as consistent with the atmosphere created by the end of \r\nthe cold war. We are delighted that this decision was made a year ago. \r\nToday, in that same spirit, we must give due consideration to the absence of \r\nthe Republic of China from this Organization, and we must also consider the \r\nimpact that absence has on the role our Organization plays in achieving global \r\ncooperation and coordination. We must acknowledge the impressive economic \r\ndevelopment of that country and the progress made in the democratization of \r\nthe Republic of China. These factors could help resolve many of the problems \r\nfacing this Organization. \r\nFor this reason, we invite Member States to initiate serious \r\nconsideration of this subject in the spirit of peace and cooperation that has \r\npredominated recently. \r\nIn the area of human rights, we have noted with satisfaction the decision \r\nto convene a world summit conference on social development, and preparations \r\nfor the World Conference on Human Rights. It is important that the United \r\nNations system assume leadership in these areas, facing, as a matter of \r\npriority, the social problems that stand in the way of improving living \r\nconditions for the most dispossessed in our societies. \r\nAs I said a year ago, Panama has set for itself a number of social \r\ndevelopment programmes over the next five years. I am happy indeed to say \r\ntoday that the United Nations Development Programme has contributed \r\neffectively in this national effort to attack the areas of extreme poverty in \r\nour country as a matter of priority. Thanks to this cooperation, we have made \r\nconsiderable progress, although I must admit that we still have a long way to \r\ngo. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n7 \r\n(President Endara Galimanv) \r\nAs part of the Central American isthmus, our country is continuing to \r\nmake efforts to lay the foundation for commitments that will benefit our six \r\nmembers. To this end, the Central American Presidents, at the twelfth summit \r\nConference in Managua, Nicaragua, last June, developed a working agenda. The \r\npurpose of that agenda is to bequeath to future generations of our countries \r\nbetter conditions for improving democratic institutions, promoting integration \r\nand fostering economic and social development. We should like to take full \r\nadvantage of this new era in our region, for we see it as a historic \r\nopportunity to strengthen the idea of a united Central America facing the \r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. \r\nFor these reasons, the Central American Presidents decided to place the \r\nemphasis at the thirteenth summit Conference which we will proudly be \r\nholding for the first time in Panama next December on the agricultural \r\nsector, which is the pillar of our economies and the primary source of \r\nemployment in our region. \r\nOur efforts to participate in the activities of all international \r\norganizations recognizing as we do that dialogue is the best way to promote \r\nrelations among nations - has led us to take steps to become a permanent \r\nmember of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and has led us to sign \r\nthe Montreal Protocol on the ozone layer. \r\nI now turn to actions within the European Community to protect the \r\nexporting of our product, bananas. As a result of the visits of several \r\nCentral American Presidents to different European countries, we now view with \r\noptimism the decision of some of these countries to oppose the resolution of \r\nthe Commission of the European Community on the subject. That resolution \r\nrecommends the imposition of quotas on the importing of bananas into the \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n8 \r\n(President Endara Galimany) \r\nCommunity, which would adversely affect thousands of jobs in that sector of \r\nour economy. \r\nAt this point I should like to stress that the consolidation of democracy \r\nand stable social peace must be understood and promoted within a modern \r\napproach to economic relations. Imposing measures such as the ones mentioned \r\nin respect of bananas is certainly not in keeping with these new realities. \r\nAt a time when there is an opening of trade in goods, products and services, \r\nit is contradictory indeed to see efforts made to restrict our banana market \r\nby applying protectionist policies that seem now to be out of date. \r\nAlong these same lines, Panama views with optimism the negotiations of \r\nthe North American Free Trade Association, which concluded last month. These \r\nnegotiations were the result of the Americas Initiative put forward by the \r\nUnited States of America. That agreement will make possible accession by \r\nother countries in the region. Thus a climate of eguity has been created in \r\nrespect of investments, markets and the transfer of technology. \r\nI should like to stress that the free trade agreement could be the \r\nmechanism that, over the short term, will make it possible to promote a plan \r\nfor intra-regional free trade. This would redound to the benefit of our \r\neconomies and be part of a balanced, competitive plan. \r\nIn this forum, I should not fail to touch on our concern over the problem \r\nof drug trafficking. Because of our geographical position and our service \r\neconomy, we have unfortunately attracted much of this unlawful and damaging \r\ntrade. Consequently, my Government has promoted, and will continue to \r\npromote, serious, responsible action to put an end to drug trafficking and the \r\nlaundering of money relating to these activities. We have signed \r\ninternational agreements and we are negotiating other similar agreements, and \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n9-10 \r\n(President Endara Galimanv) \r\nwe are carrying out successful internal operations relating to supervision and \r\ndetection in order to help undermine any incentives that might exist for this \r\nvile trade in our country. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n11 \r\n(President Endara Galimany) \r\nHowever, whether we are producer countries, countries used for transit or \r\nconsumer countries, the problem affects us all. That is why it is necessary \r\nto reaffirm our determination to fight and curb these activities, for they not \r\nonly damage the health of our citizens, but also promote violence and \r\nterrorism, which also deserve our most vigorous condemnation. \r\nTherefore, I take this opportunity to tell the world that Panamanians \r\nleaders and the people are determined allies of all those fighting against \r\ndrug trafficking and the crimes resulting from it, which make it such a \r\nreprehensible activity. \r\nIn this world forum, I should like to report on actions that Panama is \r\nnow taking to take over the administration and operation of our inter-oceanic \r\ncanal, in keeping with the 1977 Treaty. Our country will assume full \r\nownership and autonomous management of the Canal on the last day of this \r\ncentury. In the meantime, some of the improvements made by the United States \r\nin the inter-oceanic region have been handed over to the Republic of Panama; \r\nother improvements will become Panamanian property when the canal itself is \r\nhanded over. My Government has carried out many internal consultations on the \r\nsubject and has drawn up the legal framework for the administration and \r\nutilization of these improvements. This is a commitment that Panamanians have \r\nunhesitatingly made to the rest of the world. \r\nMoreover, together with our partner in the Canal the United States - we \r\nare members of a number of national and bi-national commissions preparing for \r\nthe transfer of functions at the appointed hour. Finally, in another \r\ncommission, made up of Panama, the United States and Japan, alternatives to \r\nthe Panama Canal are being studied in order to determine the best way to \r\nensure the continued competitiveness of our inter-oceanic route in the next \r\ncentury. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n12 \r\n(President Endara Galimanv) \r\nThe last decade of this century finds Panama building its future with \r\noptimism. We are strengthening our democratic system and the institutions \r\nthat are its foundation. Among other things, we are preparing for an \r\nexemplary electoral process in 1994, ensuring in turn renewal of authority in \r\nkeeping with the popular will, openly expressed. We are taking advantage of a \r\nsignificant recovery of our economy, which will benefit our social \r\ndevelopment. With a keen sense of responsibility, we are preparing ourselves \r\nto administer our Canal, from the last day of this century. We are living in \r\nfreedom and in peace with our neighbours. Panama today has a future, and it \r\nis promising. \r\nThese policies and principles guide our domestic actions and constitute \r\nthe guidelines for our international actions. That is why we support all \r\nUnited Nations actions and initiatives consistent with our principles and \r\ninterests. \r\nIn this world forum, I urge all countries to promote and consolidate \r\npeace, to foster their development and growth and to guarantee democracy and \r\njustice, for these will help us live together in a better world. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe President of the Republic of Panama for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Guillermo Endara Galimany. President of the Republic of Panama, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued) \r\nGENERAL DEBATE \r\nMr• ZLENKO (Ukraine) (spoke in Ukrainian; English text furnished by \r\nthe delegation): I should like to extend sincere congratulations to you, Sir, \r\non your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its \r\nforty-seventh session. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n13 \r\n(Mr. Zlenko. Ukraine) \r\nI am especially pleased to see in this high post a representative of \r\nBulgaria, a country that is linked to Ukraine by geographical and ethnic \r\nproximity and by centuries-old ties of friendship, cooperation and \r\ngood-neighbourly relations. \r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Shihabi, who made tireless efforts to strengthen the role of \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\nWe greatly appreciate the contribution that was made to the \r\nimplementation of radical transformations in the United Nations by \r\nMr. Perez de Cuellar, the former Secretary-General. His successor, \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has embarked on the course of deepening the \r\nreforms, with the firm intention of enhancing the role and authority of the \r\nOrganization, in response to the needs of our time. We will support these \r\nundertakings in every possible way. \r\nThe current session of the General Assembly is being held during a period \r\nof profound and truly epoch-making transformations on our planet, which have \r\nincluded in the formation of a new world order the potential of the new States \r\nbuilt on the ruins of the last empire in the history of mankind. \r\nThe disintegration of the bankrupt totalitarian system, resulting in the \r\nlargest increase in the membership of the United Nations in recent years, \r\nopened the way for the triumph of genuine freedom and democracy in vast areas \r\nof Europe and Asia and for the realization of the inalienable right of peoples \r\nto self-determination and has made it possible to place human rights at the \r\nfocus of the policies of many newly emerged States. \r\nThe people of Ukraine demonstrated through the centuries its firm desire \r\nfor independence and its aspiration to a national, political and economic \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n14-15 \r\n(Mr. Zlenko. Ukraine) \r\nrenaissance. For hundreds of years Ukrainians\u0027 drive for freedom was subdued \r\nby giving them miserable pittances or by the use of violence and repression. \r\nBut today, for the first time, our people have set out on the path leading to \r\nthe temple of independence, and no one will ever make our people deviate from \r\nthat historic path. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n16 \r\n(Mr. Zlenko. Ukraine) \r\nIn August of this year we solemnly marked the first anniversary of our \r\nindependence. That pivotal event in the life of our people was celebrated as \r\nthe triumph of democracy and freedom. And today we are facing a task of great \r\nproportions: to build a democratic Ukraine governed by the rule of law, to \r\nrevive the strength and intellectual potential of our people, to be worthy of \r\nthe memory of our ancestors who sacrificed their lives in the struggle for \r\nindependence. \r\nThe fresh winds of change make it necessary to take a new look at the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, to activate fully its enormous creative \r\npotential and to free international relations from the burden of suspicion, \r\nhostility and the renewal of violence. The shortest way to that goal is \r\nthrough international relations based on common sense and on respect for \r\nfreedom of choice, in keeping with the centuries-old principles of \r\ninternational law which are clearly understood, widely recognized and \r\nconsistently applied. \r\nAs early as the seventeenth century the celebrated Spanish theologian and \r\nphilosopher Francisco Suarez observed that although States are not combined \r\ninto a single political body, they are obliged to help one another and to \r\nmaintain and defend law and peace, since that is imperative for the benefit of \r\nall mankind. A State that violates the law and disregards international \r\nagreements is thereby undermining the foundations of its own future \r\ntranquillity. \r\nThe same vital philosophical ideas were also expounded by \r\nHryhory Skovoroda, a Ukrainian philosopher, writer and thinker of the \r\neighteenth century who stood for purity in public order and who inspired \r\nbelief in the inevitable triumph of truth and justice. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n17 \r\n(Mr. Zlenko. Ukraine) \r\nWe attach great importance to strengthening the role of the United \r\nNations in settling conflicts and resolving disputes. Although the threat of \r\ntotal military confrontation has receded, the tragic developments on the \r\nterritory of former Yugoslavia, in Nagorny Karabakh, in Georgia, in the \r\nDniester region and in other areas give us warning that local conflicts are \r\nfraught with serious danger. \r\nWe believe that joint efforts by the international community can \r\neliminate the deep-rooted causes of these conflicts, which are linked to \r\nunresolved national issues, to irresponsible appeals for the review of \r\nexisting State frontiers, to economic hopelessness, to political egocentrism \r\nand to the messianic ambitions of some States seeking to create zones of their \r\nown special interests in certain parts of the world. The task of the United \r\nNations is to establish a structure for interaction that would guarantee the \r\nsecurity of every Member State. \r\nOur country can contribute to the attainment of that goal. In the year \r\nthat has passed since the proclamation of our independence, Ukraine has \r\ntraversed the road from a quasi-State within the former USSR to a universally \r\nrecognized European State. Having joined the leading international political, \r\nhumanitarian and monetary-financial institutions, our country has assumed full \r\nresponsibility for securing its own foreign-policy interests and its external \r\neconomic interests. \r\nWithout claiming any special status in the world, we want to occupy a \r\nplace in the international community worthy of our people, our history and our \r\npotential. We can make and we want to make a constructive contribution to \r\ninternational cooperation. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n18 \r\n(Mr. Zlenko. Ukraine) \r\nUkraine welcomes the changes in the political and military structure of \r\nEurope, where we are seeing the key role in maintaining peace and stability \r\nshift from military deterrence to political mechanisms. These changes have \r\nensured the success of the process of the Conference on Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the possibility of shaping a new security \r\nmodel on the continent based on close interaction between the European \r\nStates. I would like to emphasize that the orientation towards Europe is one \r\nof the main driving forces of our foreign policy; we intend to intensify the \r\ndynamics of our relations with European States and with their regional \r\nstructures. \r\nWe intend to pursue a serious, pragmatic and result-oriented policy with \r\nrespect to the United Nations. That is why the Ukrainian Parliament decided \r\nto send a military contingent to take part in the United Nations peace-keeping \r\nmission in the territory of former Yugoslavia. Today Ukrainian soldiers are \r\ncontinuing to do their duty with honour and dignity in that suffering land. \r\nTheir mission has won universal support and recognition. \r\nThe transition of the contemporary world to a system of global \r\nintegration, multipolarity and partnership demands the creation of a new \r\nconcept of strategic stability based on a substantial and balanced reduction \r\nof existing arsenals of weapons to the dimensions of reasonable sufficiency \r\nfor defence. The results achieved so far in bilateral efforts to limit \r\narmaments should be supplemented by new multilateral agreements, whose \r\nuniversality would provide the necessary level of confidence, strengthening \r\ntrust in their implementation. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n19 \r\n(Mr. Zlenko, Ukraine) \r\nWe welcome the completion of the convention on the complete prohibition \r\nand destruction of chemical weapons. For Ukraine, which does not possess, \r\nproduce or stockpile chemical weapons in its territory, signing the convention \r\nis one of the priorities in the field of disarmament. \r\nThe question of eliminating all nuclear weapons is of fundamental \r\nsignificance for us. We are convinced that, with a well-adjusted system of \r\ncollective security based on the Charter of the United Nations, it will be \r\npossible to prevent any aggression or, if necessary, to suppress it through \r\njoint efforts. \r\nUkraine, which suffered the full effects of the Chernobyl disaster, is \r\nsupporting with even greater determination the international campaign for the \r\ncomplete renunciation of nuclear testing and for the assumption by every \r\nnuclear-weapon State of an obligation not to be the first to use nuclear \r\nweapons. \r\nSimultaneously with its proclamation of independence, Ukraine opted to \r\nbecome a State possessing no nuclear weapons. Of course, Ukraine is not the \r\nonly country in the world which has chosen non-nuclear status. But our \r\nuniqueness lies in the fact that we voluntarily took on the burden of \r\neliminating hundreds of strategic and tactical nuclear warheads inherited from \r\nthe USSR, a choice which has huge financial implications. \r\nHaving set out on the path of reducing and eliminating nuclear weapons, \r\nwe count on strict international guarantees of our national security against \r\nthe possible threat or use of force by any nuclear State. I should point out \r\nthat this is by no means a rhetorical question for our newly independent \r\nState, and we consider it in our own special context. Naturally, we count on \r\nunderstanding for our position. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n20 \r\n(Mr. Zlenko. Ukraine) \r\nUkraine intends to accede in the very near future to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; it will place all its nuclear power \r\nplants and all fissionable materials under the supervision of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). \r\nWe actively support the idea of creating a nuclear-free zone in the Black \r\nSea basin. As is known, in the agreement between Ukraine and the Russian \r\nFederation, signed on 3 August of this year at Yalta, the two major Black Sea \r\nStates officially declared the desirability of pursuing a policy aimed at \r\nmaking the Black Sea a nuclear-free zone and a zone of peace and cooperation. \r\nWe regard the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe as the most \r\nimportant element of a new security system in Europe. The entry into force of \r\nthe Treaty will make it possible to accelerate the process of European \r\ndisarmament, to remove the remaining imbalances in armed forces and to \r\neliminate unpredictability from the military and strategic situation on the \r\nContinent. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n21 \r\n(Mr. Zlenko. Ukraine) \r\nThe successful conclusion of negotiations on reducing the numbers of \r\nmilitary personnel and on implementing the provisions of the Vienna Document \r\non Confidence- and Security-building Measures opens new opportunities for \r\nstrengthening stability in Europe. Together with other European countries, we \r\nwelcome the conclusion of the \"open skies\" agreement as an important step \r\ntowards mutual trust in military activities. \r\nAgainst the background of definite changes for the better in the area of \r\narms limitation and disarmament, issues of strengthening international and \r\nregional stability take on special importance. \r\nUkraine greatly appreciates the contribution made by the United Nations \r\nto the settlement of conflicts in the \"hot spots\" of the planet and its \r\nendeavours to restore peace to the Balkans and to normalize the situations in \r\nCambodia, Cyprus, Central America and southern Africa. \r\nThe experience acquired in this sphere proves that the most efficient \r\nactions are preventive actions aimed at lessening tension before it is \r\ntransformed into open conflict between the opposing parties. The use of the \r\nmethods of preventive diplomacy must become a priority feature of United \r\nNations activity today. We support the ideas of the Secretary-General in this \r\nregard and the pragmatic proposals set forth in his report \"An Agenda for \r\nPeace\" (A/47/277). \r\nThe normalization of the situation in the Persian Gulf, with the direct \r\nparticipation of the United Nations, is facilitating the intensification of \r\nefforts aimed at settling the Arab-Israeli conflict. Ukraine believes that a \r\nconstructive dialogue on this problem at the current session of the General \r\nAssembly can foster the process of forging specific agreements that started in \r\nMadrid. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n22 \r\n(Mr. Zlenko. Ukraine) \r\nUkraine welcomes efforts aimed at stopping the violence in South Africa, \r\nand calls upon the Government and the representatives of all political forces \r\nin South Africa to continue resolutely the process of peaceful settlement. \r\nA few words about Ukraine\u0027s economic situation. The imperial system \r\ncompletely exhausted Ukraine\u0027s economy and unbalanced our economic \r\nmechanisms. Ukraine inher\u0027.ted a predominantly obsolete technology, a backward \r\ninfrastructure, the burden of foreign debt, a lack of skilled managerial \r\nstaff, low living standards for the population and galloping inflation. \r\nHowever, we are convinced that independence, the development of democracy and \r\njuridical institutions and the implementation of far-reaching political and \r\neconomic reforms will enable us to weather the transition to a market economy \r\nwithout critical social upheavals during the transition period and will create \r\nthe necessary conditions for the integration of Ukraine into the system of \r\nworld economic relations. \r\nIn carrying out the tasks before us, we must rely primarily on our own \r\nstrength, on the talent and industriousness of our people. But at the same \r\ntime, we greatly appreciate outside support for our efforts: foreign \r\ninvestment, and the furnishing of financial and advisory assistance and \r\nexpertise by the most developed countries of the world and by international \r\norganizations. \r\nWe call for concerted action to overcome the consequences of the \r\nChernobyl disaster, a tragedy unprecedented in the history of mankind, and for \r\njoint efforts by various countries in solving the complex and unparalleled \r\nproblems it caused. We hope that the present session of the General Assembly \r\nwill yield solutions appropriate to the scope of that tragedy. \r\nOur economic difficulties, the foreign debt inherited from the former \r\nSoviet Union and the Chernobyl factor make it impossible for Ukraine to meet \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n23 \r\n(Mr. Zlenko. Ukraine) \r\nfully its financial obligations to the United Nations. However, I wish to \r\nstate that this problem is constantly being given attention by the Parliament \r\nand Government of Ukraine. \r\nAt the same time, Ukraine cannot agree to a merely mechanical approach to \r\nthe question how the contribution of the former Soviet Union is to be \r\napportioned. We strongly object to the decisions taken at the last session of \r\nthe Committee on Contributions that, contrary to the existing criteria, \r\nrecommended increasing Ukraine\u0027s contribution for the next year by over \r\n50 per cent. We shall strive for a radical revision of the system used for \r\nformulating the scale of assessment, bringing it into conformity with the \r\npresent-day realities, levels of development and ability to pay of Member \r\nStates. \r\nThe pressure of economic problems is naturally bound to influence the \r\nsocial situation in our country. However, our efforts to promote respect for \r\ninternational standards in the field of human rights and protection of the \r\ninterests of national minorities were instrumental in avoiding ethnicity-based \r\nconflicts in Ukraine. At the same time, we understand the concerns expressed \r\nfrom this rostrum regarding \"discriminatory practices\", against Ukrainians and \r\nall other non-indigenous nationalities, which are growing stronger in some of \r\nthe new States that have emerged in the territory of the former USSR. We hope \r\nthat all States in whose territory Ukrainians reside will demonstrate genuine \r\nconcern and consideration for their cultural, linguistic and religious needs. \r\nThat hope was voiced with full force in the statements of the \r\nparticipants in the World Forum of Ukrainians, which recently brought to Kiev \r\nthousands of representatives of the Ukrainian diaspora, who had been forced to \r\nlive far from their native land. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n24 \r\n(Mr. Zlenko. Ukraine) \r\nAt a time when human lives are at stake and people are dying of famine in \r\nsome parts of the world, the problem of humanitarian aid should play a key \r\nrole in the activities of the United Nations and of its social and economic \r\norgans. Our country, in the light of its own past, is devoting special \r\nattention to this question. \r\nAnother humanitarian problem requires special attention because unless it \r\nis resolved, it will stand in the way of strengthening the principles of \r\ncivilized relations in international life. I am referring to the question of \r\nprisoners of war. While supporting the steps taken by the new leadership of \r\nAfghanistan in establishing peace and reconciliation in that country, I should \r\nlike to appeal to it to do its utmost to ensure an immediate search for and \r\narrange the unconditional return of Ukrainian nationals who are still being \r\nkept prisoner or are missing in action. At the same time, we call upon all \r\nStates in whose territory prisoners of war are being held to make the humane \r\ngesture of releasing the victims of military conflicts. This would also \r\ncontribute to the success of the forthcoming World Conference on Human Rights. \r\nIn my statement, I have touched upon some unresolved issues that are \r\npreventing us from moving ahead. However, none of these problems, we believe, \r\ncan impede the renaissance of the United Nations stimulated by the end of the \r\ncold war and the resulting favourable changes in the world. I can assure \r\neveryone present in this hall that Ukraine is determined to participate in the \r\nwork of the United Nations which will continue to remain a crucial element of \r\nour foreign policy, and we will do everything possible to ensure that the \r\nOrganization enters the next millennium as an effective instrument in building \r\na better world. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n25 \r\nMr. AL-KHALIFA (Bahrain) (interpretation from Arabic): Allow me, \r\nMr. President, at the outset, to express to you my sincere congratulations on \r\nyour election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General \r\nAssembly and to salute your friendly country, Bulgaria. In wishing you \r\nsuccess in conducting the proceedings of this session, it gives me pleasure to \r\nassure you of our readiness to cooperate closely with you in furthering the \r\nOrganization\u0027s objectives and upholding its principles at a time of rapid \r\nchange in the world order marked by an increasingly important role for the \r\nUnited Nations in addressing world problems is gaining new momentum. \r\nI also seize the opportunity to extend our thanks and appreciation to \r\nyour predecessor, Ambassador Samir Shihabi, the Permanent Representative of \r\nthe sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the able and judicious manner in \r\nwhich he guided our work as president of the forty-sixth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n26 \r\n(Mr. Al-Khalifa. Bahrain) \r\nIt is also my pleasure to voice our appreciation of the efforts of \r\nHis Excellency Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations during the short period since he took office, both in restructuring \r\nthe Organization and in strengthening its role in the maintenance of world \r\npeace and security. \r\nIt is gratifying indeed to witness the emergence, this year, of a large \r\nnumber of independent States and their accession to membership of the United \r\nNations. The emergence of those thirteen States, is telling proof of the \r\nstrength of their people\u0027s nationalist sentiments and aspirations, which have \r\nsurged with the end of the cold war. My country\u0027s delegation has the pleasure \r\nto welcome the new Member States. We are convinced that they will contribute \r\nconstructively to the enhancement of the United Nations role and the \r\nfurtherance of its goals and objectives. \r\nThis session is convened at a time the likes of which the world \r\nOrganization has rarely witnessed throughout its history. The winds of change \r\nhave swept away the very foundations of an international system which, for \r\nnearly half a century, was based on the foundation of the cold war\u0027s \r\nprecarious balance of power. The ideological barrier between East and West \r\nhas been brought down and, with it, the strategies of nuclear deterrence upon \r\nwhich the leaders of the bipolar world political order depended throughout the \r\npost-Second World War era. \r\nOur world today is in a state of flux. It is emerging from a past that \r\nis now collapsing under our eyes and is moving towards a future that has not \r\ntaken shape yet. Intimations of that future are being broght home to us on \r\nthe crests of mighty waves and the winds of heavy storms that have brought \r\ndown the Berlin wall, caused the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n27 \r\n(Mr. Al-Khalifa. Bahrain) \r\ndismantling of the Soviet Union side by side with the many developments and \r\nconflicts we now witness on the international arena. \r\nAlthough the features of the new world order broke forth sharply in waves \r\nof violent and profound transformations, the winds of change have not been \r\nable to uproot the problems of the cold war. For in the wake of the fall of \r\ncertain States, there was the eruption of severe national and ethnic disputes \r\non which the lid had been kept by the bipolar balance of power. Scrutiny of \r\nthe changes witnessed by the world today clearly reveals that the threads of \r\npast and present are interwoven even though developments are taking place so \r\nfast towards the creation of a delicate and precarious balance between the \r\nstatus quo and change as the new world order unfolds. \r\nThe gap between the realities of the present and forecasts of the future \r\nis engulfed in ambiguity and uncertainty at this historic juncture which we \r\nwatch with apprehension and with hope and expectation, for it is our \r\naspiration that man will finally achieve on this planet what he failed to \r\nachieve during the cold-wa..- era. It behooves us to watch out for developments \r\nand be prepared for them in a manner conducive to the creation of a climate in \r\nwhich the rights of States, both small and large, are safeguarded, their \r\nsecurity strengthened and a role ensured for each and every one of them in \r\ndetermining the future course of humanity. Therefore, we should all endeavour \r\nto come to grips with the world in this new stage and identify the role each \r\nof us should play in the formulation of that world\u0027s features and the laying \r\nof its foundations. Without such a collective partnership on the part of all \r\nmembers of the international community, the world will continue to lack \r\nequilibrium and stability and remain vulnerable to upheavals and setbacks that \r\ncould undermine the very foundations of the future. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n28 \r\n(Mr. Al-Khalifa. Bahrain) \r\nIn the context of those international changes, the United Nations has \r\nbeen able to regain some of its vitality and effectiveness in the \r\ninternational arena over the past few years. It has exerted commendable \r\nefforts to end the Iraq/Iran war, bring about the liberation of Kuwait, solve \r\nthe problem of Afghanistan and bring about the independence of Namibia. Its \r\nefforts continue in connection with the questions of Western Sahara, Cyprus, \r\nCambodia, El Salvador, South Africa, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia. \r\nThe future role of the United Nations should be one that rises to the \r\nlevel of contemporary international challenges so that the Organization may be \r\nable to influence the course of international politics and deal with \r\ntransformations that involve interaction of regional and international factors \r\nand controversies. Consequently, it is our view that the role of the United \r\nNations should evolve to embrace the following three major tasks: \r\nFirst, the creation of an advanced mechanism that would enable the United \r\nNations to carry out the tasks of achieving international peace and security \r\nin a manner that would be compatible with transformations in the international \r\narena; \r\nSecondly, the creation of a modus operandi for cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations in the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, the peaceful settlement of international disputes and \r\nrespect for States\u0027 sovereignty and territorial integrity; \r\nThirdly, adequate development of the role of the United Nations in \r\ndealing with world problems that constitute a common concern for the \r\ninternational community as a whole and are sources of anxiety to people \r\nthroughout the world, such as the problems of development, the environment, \r\nrefugees, famine, poverty and a host of other international questions. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n29-30 \r\n(Mr. Al-Khalifa. Bahrain) \r\nThe question of world peace and security with its economic and social \r\nroots has given rise to a new multifaceted vision of international security. \r\nUndoubtedly, the overlapping and intertwining of such issues require serious \r\naction on our part to coordinate policies and develop programmes for United \r\nNations organs so that they may be able to meet changing world needs. \r\nIn response to the recommendation by the Security Council in its meeting \r\nat the level of Heads of State and Government, held on 31 January 1992, the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations presented his report \"An Agenda for \r\nPeace\". It contains important recommendations and ideas that aim at \r\ndeveloping the international Organization\u0027s political performance through \r\npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping. The concept of \r\npreventive diplomacy is a new strategy based on good forecasting and early \r\nintervention by the United Nations to prevent the eruption of conflicts and to \r\nprevent the escalation to the level of hostilities of existing conflicts. \r\nIn this context, we should like to commend the role played by United \r\nNations peace-keeping operitions, a role that has proved to be effective in \r\ncontaining conflicts, defusing tensions and maintaining peace in various \r\nregions of the world. Since 1987, 13 peace-keeping operations have been \r\nundertaken. It is incumbent upon the international community, especially now, \r\nto bolster and enhance the United Nations financial and operational capability \r\nin this field so that it may be able to maintain its leadership in \r\npeace-keeping, bearing in mind that the cooperation of States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations is the key factor that would enable those forces to achieve \r\ntheir objectives and the only guarantee that they will be able to do so. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n31 \r\n(Mr. Al-Khalifa. Bahrain) \r\nPeacemaking, peace-keeping, and preventive diplomacy are undoubtedly \r\ninterrelated and mutually complementary. We believe that the concept of \r\npost-conflict peace-building introduced by the Secretary-General, together \r\nwith the preceding concepts, form an important stanchion of the Organization\u0027s \r\nfuture role in the area of promoting peaceful solutions and preventing the \r\nrecurrence of conflicts. In this context, the United Nations can cooperate \r\nwith and benefit from the potential and abilities of regional organizations \r\nand arrangements in the peaceful resolution of disputes among Member States, \r\nbearing in mind that most of the disputes that threaten international peace \r\nand security are of a regional nature. \r\nThe role of regional organizations in peace-keeping is consonant with the \r\nobjectives of the United Nations Charter. It is also called for by current \r\ninternational developments. And yet, for four decades now, the United Nations \r\nhas not been able to benefit from the capabilities of regional organizations \r\nbecause of the cold war. That cooperation is of singular importance. Its \r\nimportance is highlighted now by the aggravation of discord in parts of \r\nEastern Europe and other parts of the world under the influence of ethnic \r\nsentiments, territorial claims and border disputes. It is in this area that \r\nthe United Nations, in cooperation with the appropriate regional \r\norganizations, could use the tool of preventive diplomacy to prevent the \r\neruption of tragic ethnic conflicts, futile border hostilities, the occupation \r\nby force of other peoples\u0027 territories, or the changing of existing boundaries. \r\nIn concert with the principles and objectives which we seek to \r\nconsolidate within the framework of the United Nations, our responsibility \r\nlies in maintaining the momentum generated by the new international climate of \r\nrespect for international legality with a view to achieving stability in \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n32 \r\n(Mr. Al-Khalifa. Bahrain) \r\nsensitive regional situations, foremost among which is that in the Gulf area. \r\nIn this respect, the State of Bahrain reiterates its demand that United \r\nNations resolutions relating to the situation between Iraq and Kuwait be \r\ncomplied with. \r\nThe State of Bahrain has been following with deep concern the recent \r\nunfortunate developments in the Gulf area as a result of the actions by the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran on the island of Abu Mousa. While we emphasize the \r\nsovereignty and territorial rights of the United Arab Emirates, our adherence \r\nto the good-neighbourliness principle and our desire to avoid any further \r\ntensions in the area, we call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to abide by \r\nthe memorandum of understanding it has signed with the United Arab Emirates. \r\nFor the past several years, international relations have undergone \r\nenormous transformations in the political and economic fields that herald a \r\npattern of new economic cooperation among countries. There are expectations \r\nthat with the end of confrontation between the two super-Powers, the world \r\nwill enter an era of fruitful cooperation between States. Yet an escalation \r\nof the confrontation in the economic arena, a widening of the gap between the \r\nNorth and South, and the prevalence of extreme poverty in a number of \r\ndeveloping countries continue to endanger world security and stability. \r\nPeace and development are the most important foundations of our \r\ncivilization at present. It is therefore incumbent upon the United Nations, \r\nwhich has had about half a century of experience in international \r\norganization, to undertake side by side with the task of peace-keeping, the \r\ntask of promoting development in the developing countries. The United Nations \r\nis qualified to be the forum for the elaboration of international development \r\nstrategies and the provision of appropriate political impetus for a number of \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n33 \r\n(Mr. Al-Khalifa. Bahrain) \r\nsuch interrelated economic issues as the problems of debt, the transfer of \r\ntechnology, trade, finance, commodities, and the environment. It is thus \r\nessential to reactivate the role of the United Nations in the field of \r\neconomic development for the peoples of the world. Although the United \r\nNations designated the 1970s and the 1980s as the second and third Decades for \r\ndevelopment, it has failed to achieve the objectives thereof due to lack of \r\nfunds to finance the plan. \r\nIf rich industrial countries are to fulfil their global responsibilities, \r\nthey ought to respond to the needs of developing countries in terms of \r\ndevelopment assistance so that the cold war between the East and West may not \r\nbe replaced by another cold war between the North and South or, as the \r\nSecretary-General put it, so as not to erect an iron curtain between the North \r\nand South similar to the one that used to exist between the East and West. \r\nIn the light of this situation, the State of Bahrain, as a member of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, a major organ of the United Nations, believes \r\nthat the Council\u0027s role should be reinvigorated if it is to fulfil its mandate \r\nas provided for in Article 65 of the Charter, and if it is to furnish the \r\nSecurity Council with comprehensive reports on the economic situations in the \r\nworld\u0027s different countries. It is clear that if such situations were left to \r\nfester and deteriorate, they may indirectly threaten international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\nA number of important international conferences have been held this year, \r\nmost significant of which »ere the Eighth United Nations Conference on Trade \r\nand Development held in Colombia, and the United Nations Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development which was held in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and \r\nwhich culminated in the issuance of the Rio Declaration, Agenda 21, and other \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n34-35 \r\n(Mr. Al-Khalifa. Bahrain) \r\ninternational agreements relating to environment and development. The Rio \r\nDeclaration, with its 27 principles, recognizes the integral interrelated \r\ncharacter of the Earth and links sustainable development to environmental \r\nprotection. Agenda 21 reflects a global consensus on cooperation in the areas \r\nof environment and development and aims at addressing urgent problems in that \r\nrespect and at equipping the world with the means to rise to the challenges of \r\nthe next century. \r\nThe fact that these two Conference were held in relatively quick \r\nsuccession demonstrates the enormous capability of the United Nations to \r\nconduct political dialogue in the areas of development and international \r\neconomic cooperation. In order for the United Nations role to be strengthened \r\nin that respect. Member States should provide the Organization with the \r\nwherewithal to enable it fully to perform its mandated tasks. For \r\nwherewithal, read: the political will. \r\nIn the midst of international transformations, many peoples look forward \r\nto a secure future for themselves and for their future generations. I must \r\nvoice here the hope of my delegation that peace may prevail in the Middle \r\nEast. We welcome the signs that may lead to a just settlement of the question \r\nof Palestine in particular and of the Middle East conflict in general. The \r\nrounds of talks, which started in Madrid late in October 1991, have vividly \r\ndemonstrated the earnest nature of Arab positions and the commitment of Arab \r\nnegotiators to achieving a comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East on \r\nthe basis of the land-for-peace formula in accordance with Security Council \r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and other relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n36 \r\n(Mr. Al-Khalifa. Bahrain) \r\nIt is imperative to intensify international efforts to induce Israel to \r\nforswear its policies of expansion and settlement-building in the occupied \r\nArab territories, to recognize the inalienable rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople, to withdraw from the Syrian Golan Heights, to withdraw from southern \r\nLebanon in accordance with Security Council resolution 425 (1978), and to \r\nrespond to all constructive disarmament proposals which, if implemented, could \r\nbring about parity in military capabilities qualitatively and quantitatively \r\nand ensure security through equal commitments applicable to all Middle East \r\nStates, including Israel. \r\nIn this connection, I would like to reiterate our support for freeing the \r\nMiddle East region from all weapons of mass destruction, and reaffirm our \r\nreadiness to deal with the proposed convention on the prohibition of chemical \r\nweapons, to the extent that other States in the region are willing to respond \r\nto international demands by acceding to that convention, to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to the international system of \r\nsafeguards and inspections on the basis of equity and equality, in the \r\ninterests of the security of all States of the region without discrimination. \r\nThe human traqedy that has befallen the Somali people, and the \r\ndegradation of their human dignity, call for immediate mobilization of the \r\nconcerted efforts of the international community to put an end to that \r\ntragedy. Medical assistance and food supplies should be provided urgently to \r\nsave the Somali people from their painful plight. We welcome the United \r\nNations efforts in Somalia, and are of the opinion that an appropriate \r\npolitical mechanism should be created to put an end to the bloodshed, to \r\neffect national reconciliation, to eliminate the causes of strife between the \r\nwarring factions and to help achieve security and stability in Somalia. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Al-Khalifa. Bahrain) \r\nWe also wish to express our deep concern over the tragic situation in \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, whose people are the targets of mass annihilation and \r\nhuman-rights violations. At a time when the world looks forward to the \r\nemergence of a new world order in which peace and security would prevail, we \r\nbelieve the United Nations is duty-bound to act resolutely to put an end to \r\nthis tragic situation and to preserve the integrity of the Republic of Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina, a State Member of the United Nations. \r\nSouth Africa, which is going through a delicate phase of its history, \r\nrequires special attention on the part of the international community. \r\nDespite the positive reforms initiated last year by the Pretoria Government \r\nwith a view to drawing up a new constitution for South Africa, it is urgent \r\nthat apartheid be completely eradicated by means of constitutional reforms \r\nguaranteeing the participation of the majority of the people of South Africa \r\nin building a non-racial State. In that connection, we support United Nations \r\nefforts to put an end to violence and to help create favourable conditions for \r\nnegotiations on transforming South Africa into a non-racial, unitary State. \r\nThe Cyprus problem has eluded solution for a long time. However, there \r\nhave been signs recently that may lead to a solution. We welcome the new \r\npositive movements as well as the Secretary-General\u0027s efforts in that \r\ndirection. \r\nThe peoples of the world look forward with full confidence to a new world \r\nin which security and prosperity prevail. Yet, despite our hopes for the \r\nfuture, threats to the human race and the environment abound. Unless we all \r\nwork to overcome those threats and to address their causes, we will be opening \r\na Pandora\u0027s box, releasing all its evils while leaving hope locked inside. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n38 \r\n(Mr. Al-Khalifa. Bahrain) \r\nThe success of the United Nations in dealing with the new challenges will \r\ndepend on its ability to build confidence among nations and, with the help of \r\na broad creative vision, to mobilize efforts, resources and knowledge with a \r\nview to bringing them to bear on the transformation of world society into a \r\nsociety in which real security, peace, tranguility and equality may prevail. \r\nIf we may liken the desired world order to a ship, then peace, security \r\nand economic development are the canvas of which its sails are made; \r\ninternational legality is its pennant; and only through stability can it sail \r\nto safety. It behoves us to work together in weaving the yarn to make the \r\ncanvas of the sails, and to steer our ship toward a secure future for all our \r\npeoples. \r\nMr. KIM (Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea) (spoke in Korean; \r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): On behalf of the delegation of the \r\nDemocratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea, I would like to congratulate you, \r\nMr. Ganev, on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its \r\nforty-seventh session. It is my conviction that under your able leadership \r\nthis session will come to a fruitful conclusion. \r\nI would like also to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for \r\nthe efforts made over the past year by His Excellency \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in carrying out his heavy responsibilities as \r\nSecretary-General, to ensure world peace and security and to strengthen the \r\nrole of the United Nations in line with changes in the international situation. \r\nThe end of the cold war that had persisted ever since the end of the \r\nSecond World War brought with it great changes in the recent international \r\nsituation. In this vortex of change in the international situation, the phase \r\nof detente is beginning in North-East Asia. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n39-40 \r\n(Mr. Kim. Democratic People\u0027s \r\nRepublic of Korea) \r\nRecent events on the Korean peninsula are attracting world attention. \r\nDialogue between the north and the south on many levels is under way to end \r\nthe distrust and confrontation resulting from prolonged national division. In \r\nparticular, the north-south high-level talks have resulted in the adoption of \r\nthe Agreement on Reconciliation, Non-Aggression, Cooperation and Exchanges. \r\nThis is a great victory in the nationwide struggle to bring about the three \r\nprinciples of national reunification: independence, peaceful reunification \r\nand great national unity. It is a new, historic milestone on the road to \r\nnational reunification. The north-south Agreement and the north-south Joint \r\nStatement of 4 July constitute a programme for national reunification that \r\nreflects the aspirations of the Korean nation to reunification and the current \r\ntrends towards peace. \r\nIn the north-south Agreement, the north and the south make it clear that \r\nrelations betveen the two .sides are not inter-State relations but rather \r\nspecial relations formed provisionally in the process of moving towards \r\nreunification. In the Agreement, the north and the south also pledge to \r\nrecognize and respect each other\u0027s systems and to refrain from interfering in \r\neach other\u0027s internal affairs. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n41 \r\n(Mr. Kim. Democratic People1!! \r\nRepublic of Korea) \r\nThis Agreement shows that both the north and the south want a single \r\nunified State, not \"two States\", and look to achieve reunification along the \r\nlines of confederation. Reunification through confederation based on one \r\nnation, one State, two systems and two Governments has become a realistic \r\ngoal. It is an issue which can no longer be avoided both in view of the \r\npresent trend of the international situation which is moving towards \r\nrapprochement, detente and the end of confrontation and in the light of the \r\nspecific conditions on the Korean peninsula where two different ideas and \r\nsystems exist. \r\nThe highlight of our proposal for reunification through confederation is \r\nthat the north and south form a unified national Government to be represented \r\nby the north and the south on an equal basis under which the north and the \r\nsouth exercise regional autonomy with equal rights and power. It will be the \r\nmost peaceful and ideal method of reunification. It will form a single State \r\nby uniting the two autonomous governments, maintaining the two systems \r\nintact. And it will be based on the principle of coexistence with neither \r\nside conquering or overpowering or being conquered or being overpowered. \r\nThis proposal for confederation, acceptable to both sides during \r\ndialogue, is now turning from possibility to feasibility. The recent \r\n8th North-South High Level Talks in Pyongyang have led to the functioning of \r\njoint committees for the implementation of the Agreement in different areas \r\nsuch as political, military, economic, social and cultural. \r\nIt is true that the north-south dialogue for implementing the Agreement \r\nis confronted with a seriej of obstacles and difficulties because the feelings \r\nof distrust and confrontation conceived during the long period of the division \r\nstill remain. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Kim. Democratic People\u0027s \r\nRepublic of Korea) \r\nHowever, we are optimistic about the prospect of north-south dialogue and \r\nreunification. Blood is thicker than water. The homogeneous nationhood of \r\nthe Korean people surpasses the differences of the systems and ideas of the \r\nnorth and south. Our people, with their strong sense of national \r\nindependence, have good traditions and experiences of having achieved unity \r\nfor the common cause of the nation, transcending the differences of ideas, \r\npolitical views and religious beliefs. \r\nThe Government of our Republic will exert all its efforts to follow \r\nthrough the already-begun reunification process in order to reach the final \r\npoint of reunification by reviving such national traditions. We will also do \r\nour best to resolve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula at an early date \r\nin the interest of peace and reunification of Korea, as agreed upon by the \r\nnorth and the south in the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the \r\nKorean Peninsula. \r\nThe nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and the nuclear suspicion that \r\nremains unresolved stem from the deployment of United States nuclear weapons \r\nin south Korea. Therefore, fundamental to resolving the nuclear issue on the \r\nKorean peninsula is the withdrawal of United States nuclear weapons from South \r\nKorea and the removal of the serious apprehension of our nation which has been \r\nunder a nuclear threat during the last 30 years. \r\nTo this end, it is urgent to adopt an agreement and regulations of \r\ninspection under the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean \r\nPeninsula and to inspect the United States nuclear weapons and bases in south \r\nKorea. The North-South Joint Nuclear Control Committee, although it has met \r\nseveral times, has not yet adopted the regulations of inspection to verify the \r\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula nor has it carried out any inspection \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n43-45 \r\n(Mr. Kim. Democratic People\u0027s \r\nRepublic of Korea) \r\nof the United States nuclear weapons and bases in south Korea. This is due to \r\nthe fact that the south Korean authorities are not in a position to exercise \r\ntheir sovereign right regarding the question of United States nuclear weapons \r\nand bases. \r\nThis situation, we believe, has prevented the North-South Joint Nuclear \r\nControl Committee from arriving at an agreement to include the United States \r\nnuclear weapons and bases in the scope of the parameters for inspection. \r\nQuite recently, it was revealed that United States nuclear weapons have been \r\nstockpiled in the secret nuclear storage in south Korea and a naval base in \r\nJinhae, south Korea, also serves as a United States nuclear submarine base. \r\nThis causes a great number of people to have suspicion about the sincerity of \r\nthe announcement of the non-existence of United States nuclear weapons in \r\nsouth Korea. It is most deplorable that the south Korean authorities do not \r\nhave a say on the presence of nuclear weapons from other countries which are \r\nnow on their own soil nor can they verify the withdrawal of these nuclear \r\nweapons. \r\nAs far as we are concerned, we have declared time and time again that we \r\nhave no nuclear weapons, nor any intention or capacity to make them. We have \r\nno need to produce them. It is our firm will, in line with our invariable \r\nanti-nuclear peace policy, to use nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes \r\nand not to develop nuclear weapons. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n46 \r\n(Mr. Kim. Democratic People\u0027s \r\nRepublic of Korea) \r\nThe honesty of the peaceful nuclear policy of the Government of our Republic \r\nand the will for denuclearization have already been proved by several ad hoc \r\ninspections of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The so-called \r\nsuspicion of our \"nuclear development\" is fading away. We do what we say and \r\nwe never say empty words. \r\nIf the south Korean authorities are really concerned about the \"future\" \r\nof the Korean peninsula and interested in realizing its denuclearization, they \r\nshould take an independent stand free from outside forces and respond as soon \r\nas possible to adopting the regulations of inspection, so that the overall \r\ninspection of United States nuclear weapons and bases could be carried out as \r\nagreed upon by the north and the south. \r\nThe reunification of the Korean peninsula presupposes the eradication of \r\nthe legacy of the cold war and the termination of foreign interference. The \r\nKorean question has been closely related to international relations \r\nhistorically. The division of Korea was brought about not by the internal \r\ncontradictions of our nation but was imposed on it against its will to serve \r\nonly the interests of foreign forces. \r\nIt is foreign forces that impede the ongoing north-south talks. \r\nConsequently, the key issue in realizing the reunification of the Korean \r\npeninsula today is to end foreign interference in the Korean question. The \r\npresence of United States troops in south Korea is clear evidence of \r\ninterference by a foreign force impeding the solution to the Korean question. \r\nDuring the cold-war era the presence of foreign armed forces in other \r\ncountries was \"justified\" under the pretext of preserving the so-called \r\nbalance of forces. However, this argument no longer holds today since the \r\ncold war ended and power politics have become meaningless. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Kim. Democratic People\u0027s \r\nRepublic of Korea) \r\nThere is no justification whatsoever for the continued presence of United \r\nStates forces in south Korea. On the Korean peninsula, the north and the \r\nsouth have pledged themselves to non-aggression through the Agreement and have \r\nformed the joint military commission to deal with military affairs. \r\nNevertheless, the United States is still pursuing a policy of \"power \r\npolitics\" based on the cold-war way of thinking. The United States continues \r\nto \"justify\" the stationing of its armed forces in south Korea with the new \r\nargument that a \"power vacuum\" could be created. \r\nIt is contradictory to claim, according to one\u0027s interest, that on some \r\noccasions peace has come to the world and on other occasions to divide the \r\nworld into friends and enemies, talking about a \"power vacuum\". The United \r\nStates must drop its policy of power towards the Korean peninsula and withdraw \r\nits troops from south Korea, thereby fulfilling its responsibility in helping \r\nto achieve peace and the reunification of Korea. \r\nIn today\u0027s world - which stands at the crossroads of independence or \r\ndomination, peace or war, cooperation or division the peace, security and \r\nreunification of the Korean peninsula become one of the most urgent questions, \r\nthe solution of which brooks no further delay. The problem of Korea\u0027s \r\nreunification is a touchstone. Whether or not it is solved will clarify \r\nwhether international society is entering a stage of independent, peaceful and \r\ndemocratic development or still remains in the era of domination and \r\nsubjugation, conflict and :onfrontation. \r\nIt is our hope that Korea\u0027s reunification will be realized through \r\nconfederation on the basis of the three principles of independence, peaceful \r\nreunification and great national unity which the north and south have already \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n48-50 \r\n(Mr. Kim. Democratic People\u0027s \r\nRepublic of Korea) \r\nannounced with full commitment, thus showing one part of the genuine \r\ndevelopment of international society. \r\nHumankind is now at a historical turning-point for opposing domination \r\nand subjugation and building a new, free and peaceful world. Such aspirations \r\nof humankind, however, are still being gravely challenged by the old forces \r\nthat pursue power politics. Despite the collapse of the cold-war structure \r\ncharacterized by confrontation between the super-Powers, there are new, open \r\nattempts to capitalize on this situation in order to establish world \r\ndomination. \r\nIf such attempts are allowed to go unchecked, the world will change from \r\nthe cold-war structure of a bipolar system to the hegemonistic structure of a \r\nunipolar system and the democratic development of international society will \r\nsuffer yet another setback. \r\nTherefore, today\u0027s era can brook no further delay in establishing a new, \r\njust international order to replace the old international order under which a \r\nfew countries go unchallenged and freely dominate the destiny of humankind. \r\nThere are big and small countries in the world, but there cannot be senior or \r\njunior countries; there are developed and less developed nations, but there \r\ncannot be dominating nations and nations destined to be dominated. \r\nAll countries and nations are entitled to independent and equal rights as \r\nequal members of international society, regardless of the size of their \r\nterritories or level of development. Neither privileges nor arbitrariness \r\nshould be tolerated in international relations, and friendship and cooperation \r\namong countries should be developed positively on the principle of mutual \r\nrespect, non-interference, equality and mutual benefit. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. Kim. Democratic People\u0027s \r\nRepublic of Korea) \r\nIt is the expectation of the people of the world that the United Nations, \r\nunder the changed situation today, will play a pivotal role in securing peace \r\nand achieving the common prosperity of mankind by fulfilling its mission as \r\nthe international organization to safeguard world peace and justice. \r\nAt the recent tenth summit conference of non-aligned countries, the Heads \r\nof State and Government were unanimous in their emphasis on the necessity of \r\nstrengthening the role of the United Nations in safeguarding world peace and \r\nsecurity and in establishing an equitable international order. \r\nThe United Nations should pay careful attention to bringing about \r\ndisarmament and the dismantling of weapons of mass destruction, including \r\nnuclear weapons, in keeping with the present situation in which the cold war \r\nhas come to an end. Mankind can neither get rid of the danger of nuclear war, \r\nnor expect true peace, so long as the arms race continues unbridled and \r\nnuclear weapons remain. We hold that a comprehensive treaty banning nuclear \r\ntests should be concluded as soon as possible. Testing and production of \r\nnuclear weapons should be stopped, and nuclear weapons should be abolished \r\nonce and for all. \r\nThe prevention of the emergence of any new nuclear Power is another \r\nimportant issue in settling the nuclear problem. In this connection, we could \r\nnot but express our concern that, despite world condemnation, Japan is storing \r\nmore nuclear fuel than it needs, and is even carrying out an adventurous plan \r\ninvolving the marine transportation of plutonium. \r\nThe Government of the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea will in the \r\nfuture, as in the past, make positive efforts to abolish nuclear weapons, \r\nbiological and chemical weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction on \r\nthe globe. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. Kim. Democratic People\u0027s \r\nRepublic of Korea) \r\nThe United Nations should pay particular attention to the economic issue, \r\none of the important problems in establishing a new international order at \r\npresent, and endeavour to eliminate the ever-widening gap between the \r\ndeveloped and the developing countries. People in many developing countries \r\nare enduring great suffering from famine and disease. Anyone who feels \r\nresponsibility for the survival and future of mankind cannot turn away from \r\nsuch tragedies occurring in the world. \r\nIt is the most urgent common task of mankind at present to spare the \r\npeoples of the developing countries the calamities of famine and disease. The \r\ndeveloped countries should feel due responsibility for the economic poverty of \r\nthe developing countries, and should refrain from hindering the economic \r\ndevelopment of the developing countries. In this regard, the Government of \r\nour Republic holds that dialogue between the developed and the developing \r\ncountries should be resumed at the earliest possible date, the present unequal \r\ninternational economic relations should be restructured, and constructive \r\nmeasures should be taken for the establishment of a new equitable \r\ninternational economic order. \r\nAlong with this, the developing countries should take practical measures \r\nto achieve South-South cooperation, starting with the spheres of food, \r\nagriculture and public health, which will be indispensable in eradicating \r\nfamine and disease. \r\nThe United Nations should also continue to concentrate on the peaceful \r\nsolution of regional disputes and the elimination of all kinds of interference \r\nin internal affairs and unjust pressure. Today, when the confrontational \r\nstructure between the super-Powers has collapsed and new, many-sided \r\ninternational relations are emerging, ethnic, national and racial \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Kim. Democratic People\u0027s \r\nRepublic of Korea) \r\ncontradictions which have long been obscured behind the cold war are rapidly \r\nsurfacing with increased intensity, thus triggering new regional conflicts. \r\nThese constitute elements of instability, which will complicate regional \r\nsituations and cause serious damage to world peace and security. \r\nUrgent measures should be taken to settle the problems of regional \r\ndisputes peacefully through dialogue, negotiations and political \r\ncoordination. All countries and nations are entitled to decide freely on \r\ntheir own political and economic systems and development on the basis of \r\nrespect for the principles of national sovereignty, the right to \r\nself-determination, and non-interference in internal affairs. We should not \r\nallow any attempts to infringe upon the sovereignty of other countries, to \r\ninterfere in their internal affairs and to impose unfair blockades and \r\npressure. Human rights should no longer be used as leverage for political \r\npressure against and interference in the developing countries. \r\nWe take this opportunity to extend our unqualified support for and \r\nsolidarity with the struggle of the peoples in Asia, Africa, Latin America and \r\nthe rest of the world to safeguard national independence and sovereignty and \r\nachieve independent national development, particularly the struggle of the \r\nCambodian people under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk to restore \r\npeace and national unity and the status of a sovereign State; the struggle of \r\nthe Palestinian and other Arab peoples for a fair solution to the Middle East \r\nquestion, centred on the Palestinian question; the struggle of the South \r\nAfrican people to end the policy of apartheid and attain their country\u0027s \r\ndemocratic development; and the struggle of the Cuban people to defend their \r\nsovereignty against all kinds of foreign pressure and interference. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n54-55 \r\n(Mr. Kim. Democratic People\u0027s \r\nRepublic of Korea) \r\nThe Government of our Republic recognizes that the United Nations should \r\ndemocratize itself as soon as possible in order to fulfil its responsibilities \r\nand roles in establishing a new world order. Before anything else is done, \r\nthe United Nations should be restructured and reformed to develop \r\ninternational relations on a new democratic basis. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n56 \r\n(Mr. Kim. Democratic People\u0027s \r\nRepublic of Korea) \r\nThe restructuring of the United Nations is indispensable, inasmuch as it will \r\nenable the world body to perform efficiently its main mission as an \r\ninternational organization safeguarding world peace and justice by dynamically \r\ncoping with a changed reality and new challenges. \r\nTo this end, the United Nations should be democratized on the principle \r\nof ensuring independence, equality and justice for all Member States and never \r\ntolerating privileges within the United Nations. Independence, equality and \r\njustice are, indeed, strong binding forces that have enabled more than 100 \r\ncountries on this planet to join in one community, the United Nations, \r\nirrespective of differences in ideologies and systems and the gap between the \r\nrich and the poor. \r\nIn order to realize the democratization of the United Nations and to \r\nensure its impartiality in line with the present changing international \r\nsituation, the privileged positions of a few countries should no longer be \r\npermitted in the United Nations. The relations between the Security Council, \r\nthe General Assembly and the Secretary-General should be reorganized with a \r\nview to strengthening the United Nations. In particular, the Security Council \r\nshould not infringe the supreme authority of the General Assembly. \r\nIn this regard, we believe that special attention should be paid to the \r\nproblem of the composition of the Security Council. However, we consider that \r\na country that still fails to feel any responsibility for aggression and war \r\ncrimes committed during the Second World War is not qualified to become a \r\npermanent member of the Security Council, even if the number of the Council\u0027s \r\npermanent members is to be increased. \r\nOne of the most important problems in democratizing the United Nations is \r\nto eliminate the leftover inequities of the cold war. The United Nations \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Kim. Democratic People\u0027s \r\nRepublic of Korea) \r\nCommand, a legacy of the cold-war era, still remains on the Korean peninsula. \r\nIt is indeed astonishing and surprising that these \"United Nations forces\" -\r\nwhich are not under the command of the United Nations and over which the \r\nUnited Nations cannot exercise any authority still exist in this world. \r\nThe United Nations should no longer deeply disappoint Member States with \r\nthe sense that its authority is applied selectively, depending on which State \r\nis involved. The United Nations should live up to the expectations of Member \r\nStates in terms of its impartial and sincere image by eradicating all unjust \r\nand contradictory remnants of the cold war. \r\nOur delegation attaches great importance to this forty-seventh session of \r\nthe General Assembly and will exert every effort to ensure its success. What \r\nis important in ensuring world peace and security and in strengthening \r\ninternational cooperation is to further enhance the responsibility and role of \r\nStates Members of the United Nations. \r\nThe Government of the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea will actively \r\ncontribute to building a prosperous, peaceful and free new world by faithfully \r\nfulfilling its obligations as a State Member of the United Nations at this \r\nhistoric turning-point in the achievement of a durable peace and security in \r\nthe world. \r\nMr. KHALIKNAZARZODA (Tajikistan) (spoke in Farsi; English text \r\nfurnished by the delegation): As the first representative of the Independent \r\nRepublic of Tajikistan, I wish to congratulate you. Sir, on your election to \r\nthe presidency of the Assembly and to express my Government\u0027s confidence in \r\nyour guidance of the deliberations of the General Assembly at its \r\nforty-seventh session to a successful conclusion. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n58-60 \r\n(Mr. Khaliknazarzoda. Tajikistan) \r\nI should also like to convey the felicitations of my Government to \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, under whose able leadership we are confident the \r\nUnited Nations will stand up to the new challenges in the years to come. \r\nThe breakup of the Soviet Union more than a year ago gave birth to new \r\nindependent States, which are making their mark on the world map. Although \r\nsome of these States obtained their independence fairly easily, most of them \r\nare experiencing a great deal of difficulty in forming new States. \r\nThe formation of a new Tajikistan is currently at a difficult and \r\nsensitive stage, which could be cause for concern. Tajikistan, like some \r\nother former Soviet States, is in the midst of an economic crisis. Since the \r\nreasons for this crisis are quite obvious, I should like to point out several \r\nother factors that exacerbate the severity of our situation. \r\nFirst, as an agricultural country, we were recently devastated by heavy \r\nrains and floods, which ruined our crops. Our economic losses are estimated \r\nat more than 10 billion roubles. In this context, allow me, on behalf of the \r\npeople and Government of Tajikistan, to extend our appreciation to the people \r\nand Governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, Turkey and the \r\nUnited States of America for their assistance. However, I must add that this \r\nrelief assistance has fallen far short of our proportionately large needs. I \r\ntherefore call upon all international humanitarian organizations to send \r\nemergency relief assistance and foodstuffs to Tajikistan as soon as possible. \r\nSecondly, our geographical location puts us at a disadvantage in terms of \r\ntransportation and accessibility. As far as transportation is concerned, up \r\nuntil the past few weeks there was even a threat of a blockade of the Republic. \r\nLastly, Tajikistan has been experiencing some political unrest during the \r\ncourse of the past year. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n61 \r\n(Mr. Khaliknazarzoda. Tajikistan) \r\nDespite these problems, since its independence Tajikistan has been \r\nrecognized by 115 countries; established diplomatic relations with 37 \r\ncountries and opened the doors of the embassies of seven countries in our \r\ncapital, Dushanbe; and has become a member of such great world organizations \r\nas the United Nations, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, \r\nand the Economic Cooperation Organization. I humbly submit that this is an \r\nongoing process. \r\nAt this point, I should like to outline the foreign policy of the \r\nRepublic of Tajikistan. As members know, from the very first days of its \r\nindependence Tajikistan chose democracy as a system for its new development; \r\ndespite economic and social difficulties, and even the death of its own sons, \r\nit has remained and will remain firm in its choice. It is no secret that the \r\ntension in our country was caused mainly by the former Government\u0027s attempts \r\nto breach certain regulations concerning freedom of the media and human \r\nrights. But these attempts failed and we will not allow them to surface \r\nagain. At present, there is no power in Tajikistan that can stop the movement \r\nof democracy, but we need the support of the world community to ensure that \r\ndemocracy prevails in our Republic. \r\nUnfortunately, owing to the sensitivity of the situation, we cannot \r\ndisclose information concerning certain events in our country. We believe \r\nthat such information, if known, could only intensify the problem. But we \r\nwish the world community to know that we have no objection to the kind of \r\nfreedom of the media that conveys true facts from various points of view and \r\nwithin the framework of integrity and professional ethics. We have had no \r\ncase in which a journalist has been refused entry into Tajikistan or in which \r\nwe have interfered with his or her activities. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Khaliknazarzoda. Tajikistan) \r\nNevertheless, we are often unhappy with the activity of the media from \r\nsome countries that distort the facts and actual events. For instance, for a \r\nyear certain media sources have been claiming that Tajikistan is building a \r\nfundamental Islamic State. They support this claim by alleging that \r\nTajikistan is going to adopt an Islamic ideology in the place of communism; \r\nthat Tajikistan is the only Islamic republic of the former Soviet Union where \r\na political Islamic party exists legally and has grown into a unique political \r\nforce; and that Tajikistan\u0027s foreign policy extends preferential treatments to \r\nIslamic countries. I declare before the General Assembly that none of these \r\nallegations is accurate and that we reject them all. \r\nThe communist system and the communist ideology failed, and their \r\ninfluence is insignificant now. To believe that the people of Tajikistan \r\nwould wish to replace communism with an Islamic ideology would be a great \r\nmistake. On the basis of freedom of speech and assembly, peoples of different \r\npolitical persuasions including democratic, nationalist and Islamic groups \r\nare legally active, in unison, in today\u0027s Tajikistan. This is the first sign \r\nof the democratization process in Tajikistan. We call upon the international \r\ncommunity to assist us in our process of democratization. A relapse into \r\ncommunist dictatorship is impossible in our country. The people of Tajikistan \r\nare against any totalitarian regime. There is no foundation in Tajikistan for \r\nestablishing such a totalitarian government. However, we are extremely \r\nconcerned that the critical state of our economy can lead our country off its \r\nchosen course. Therefore, I appeal to the representatives of the world \r\ncommunity to evaluate the situation in Tajikistan and to support the new \r\ndemocracy. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. Khaliknazarzoda. Tajikistan) \r\nAs I have already indicated, all political parties in Tajikistan function \r\nwithin the law. Any conclusion to the contrary would be ill-founded and \r\nunrealistic. \r\nOn the question of friendly relations between Tajikistan and the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran and the Islamic State of Afghanistan, I should say that for \r\nus these are not merely two neighbouring Muslim countries. Tajikistan, Iran, \r\nand Afghanistan recall for one another the historic memory of a single \r\nnation. All of us constitute a single cultural, ethnic and linguistic unit. \r\nWe rejoice in our independence, which allows us to establish friendly and \r\ngood-neighbourly relations with our brothers and sisters in Iran and \r\nAfghanistan. We are proud of our heritage, our history and our culture, and \r\nhope that the significance of these factors in our lives will never diminish. \r\nOnce one has strayed from one\u0027s origins, one must seek a state of reunion. \r\nI also want to emphasize that the goal of our foreign policy is to create \r\na democratic society that will live in peace with its neighbours. This is the \r\nultimate objective we pursue in our internal and foreign policies. Our \r\nforeign policy is, in fact, designed to secure this noble goal. The \r\nunderlying objective of our foreign policy is to create a positive environment \r\nfor Tajikistan in the international community. In this process, we will \r\nendeavour to adopt the type of measures and policies that benefit the people \r\nof Tajikistan while at the same time not constituting a threat or disservice \r\nto the interests of other nations. We support the guidelines established and \r\nrecognized by the world community with respect to the norms of international \r\nrelations, which stand against violations of human rights, oppression and \r\nracism. We support the peaceful settlement of all regional and international \r\nconflicts. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n64 \r\n(Mr. Khaliknazarzoda. Tajikistan) \r\nTajikistan supports the development of large-scale relations with all \r\nmembers of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). We fully recognize \r\nand respect the inviolability of existing borders between the members of the \r\nCommonwealth of Independence States. We protect the human and cultural rights \r\nof all people living in the territory of our Republic and wish and hope that \r\nthe same conditions hold true for the Tajiks living in other States of the \r\nCIS. At the same time, we recognize that political borders in the Central \r\nAsian republics are not based on ethnic origin and that this reality demands \r\nthe exercise of much responsibility on all sides. \r\nTajikistan\u0027s foreign policy is based on peaceful coexistence, \r\ngood-neighbourly relations and non-interference in other countries\u0027 internal \r\naffairs. Hence, we wish to establish political, economic and cultural \r\nrelations with our contiguous and non-contiguous neighbouring countries, such \r\nas China, India, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. \r\nTajikistan is situated in a region where Islamic culture and spirituality \r\nare deeply rooted. We therefore establish relations with countries and \r\nIslamic organizations according to our spiritual and cultural requirements. \r\nIslam is a holy and divine religion and, in our view, certain Western media \r\nhave created an inaccurate picture of it. \r\nFor more than a century we lived under the Russian Tsars and later we \r\nlived under the Soviet Union. At this period of our history we are not making \r\nany judgement, positive or negative. What is past is past. Through our ties \r\nwith Russia and Russian intellectuals, we learned and became familiar with \r\nEuropean civilization. Today we are able to establish our own ties with \r\nEurope and come even closer to its civilization. We believe that the peoples \r\nof Western Europe will show us their support and assist the Tajik people in \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n65 \r\n(Mr. Khaliknazarzoda, Tajikistan) \r\ntheir noble struggle. We feel that our tremendous hydro-power, agriculture \r\nand mining industry offers great potential for cooperation with European \r\ncountries. \r\nAs a newly established democracy, Tajikistan greatly values friendly \r\nrelations with all States in Europe, the Americas, Africa, the Near and \r\nFar East and South-East Asia on the basis of mutual respect. We invite the \r\nrepresentatives of all countries in the world to visit Tajikistan and to \r\nwitness our open-door policy for friendly relations and mutual cooperation. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n66 \r\n(Mr. Khaliknazarzoda. Tajikistan) \r\nWe wish to assure the world community that the leadership in Tajikistan \r\nis doing its utmost to stop gun-smuggling of all kinds on its southern borders \r\nand to prevent its recurrence. The Government has devised a scheme for : \r\nconciliation and for the disarming of parties to the conflict. Conditions in \r\nour territory are gradually normalizing. In this context, progress has been \u003c. \r\nachieved; the conflict limited in any case to the central portion of one of \r\nthe provinces has de-escalated and a cease-fire has been agreed upon and \r\nannounced. Ninety per cent of our territory is in a peaceful state. This is \r\nnot a temporary calm, but the beginning of continued peace and durable \r\nstability throughout Tajikistan. We want to assure the world that we have no \r\nintention of becoming one of the globe\u0027s hot spots. ^ \r\nI invite representatives to visit Tajikistan, one of the oldest human ; \r\ncivilizations in the world, to begin a new era of friendship and cooperation. rti \r\nOur goal is to become an economically developed country with friendly trade , \r\nrelations with our neighbours and with other countries in the world community. , \r\nTajikistan respects and fully observes the United Nation Charter and the ,, \r\nrule of international law. We support the constructive programmes designed by ,. \r\nthe United Nations for the settlement of conflicts and problems throughout the „. \r\nworld. , \r\nWe wish to state that Tajikistan has designated a Permanent , \r\nRepresentative to the United Nations and that he has already begun to fulfil . \r\nhis duties. We believe that this will contribute to a strengthening of our \r\nties with the United Nations and the rest of the world. \r\n\"hi \r\nhi \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n67 \r\nMr. LUNA (Peru) (interpretation from Spanish): Permit me to \r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election, which symbolizes the spriit \r\nof renewal of the present period in international relations. Many of our \r\ncountries aspire to emulate your country\u0027s efforts to overcome obstacles and \r\nspread politial and economic freedom and become a productive part of the world \r\nsystem. \r\nThe Government of Peru shares those same objectives, and is seeking to \r\nrestore the legitimacy and trustworthiness that have been lacking in the \r\npast. To that end, we are seeking to modernize, to consolidate democracy and \r\neconomic competitiveness and, above all, to base our actions on the interests \r\nof the majority. In a word, we are attempting to engage in a true process of \r\nredefinition and national reconstruction. \r\nThe majority of the Members of the United Nations face similar problems, \r\nbut nothing can be done if the Organization cannot begin to function as a \r\ngenuinely multilateral association of sovereign nations with equal rights and \r\nduties as provided for in the Charter. To that end we must reform the United \r\nNations and make it more effective, with the same perseverence and \r\ndetermination our Governments have shown in their national reconstruction \r\nefforts. \r\nDemocratization througn decision-making by consensus; administrative \r\nreform; a balance among the various bodies of the Organization; and improved \r\ncooperation for development: these are among the crucial factors for the \r\nfuture of the United Nations and for its prestige and authority. The \r\ndeveloping countries have the ongoing task of ensuring respect for the \r\nprinciples of the Charter. On the basis of those same principles, the major \r\nPowers must redefine their real national priorities. It would then be \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n68 \r\n(Mr. Luna. Pem) \r\npossible to decide on a mandate agreeable to both sides that would orient the \r\nrebirth of the United Nations and prevent erratic extremism. \r\nThe collapse of communism did not mean the automatic disappearance of the \r\nworld\u0027s problems, but it has given the world community its first opportunity \r\nin 50 years to reorient international relations towards peace and well-being. \r\nWe face an unprecedented, formidable effort that can now begin in proptious \r\ncircumstances. The bases of this common effort are: development; the \r\nsolution of disputes by diplomatic means; respect for law; and the application \r\nof fundamental economic and political freedoms. The United Nations system is \r\nthe only mechanism creative enough to put this into effect. Only though \r\nmultilateral cooperation will it be possible to conflate collective action and \r\nrespect for national sovereignty without manoeuvring to preserve or increase \r\ninternational influence which would be even worse in a world free of \r\nideological motivations or the imperatives of the cold war. \r\nFor our countries as a group, it is vitally important to resume the \r\nNorth-South dialogue on a constructive and realistic basis. None of the \r\nglobal problems threatening the survival of mankind can be dealt with \r\nadequately without the active participation of the developing countries. The \r\neconomic and social aspects of multilateral policy are in the interests of all \r\nMember States. United Nations action in this realm has been notoriously \r\ninadequate. \r\nWith the ideological confrontation of the post-War period overcome, the \r\nmost urgent problem today \u0027.s the world recession and the consequent risk of \r\nregional isolationism. Undue concern for political and security matters or a \r\nnarrow view of world problems can cloak conservative impulses and new \r\nprotectionist tendencies, which would pose the threat of undue interference. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n69 \r\n(Mr. Luna. Peru) \r\nThe threat of this new world division can be dispelled only if we all agree \r\nthat the various aspects of North-South relations together constitute the most \r\nurgent, critical factor of international security. \r\nNone the less, Peru recognizes the importance and urgency of maintaining \r\npeace and preventing conflicts. We are prepared to expand our traditional \r\nparticipation in peace-keeping operations. The Secretary-General\u0027s Agenda for \r\nPeace sets out many innovative ideas for the future of United Nations action \r\nin this sphere, and we firmly support them. \r\nThe situation of Peru exemplifies the unyielding relationship among \r\nnational, regional and world bodies. In our case, this relationship, \r\nfrequently addressed by the theoreticians of international relations, becomes \r\nsomething of a paradigm, because my country has worked to promote its national \r\ninterests, respect for national sovereignty and multilateral action. In other \r\nwords, Peru seeks to reconcile a political programme dealing both with the \r\nviability of its internal plans and with foreign affairs through a consistent \r\neconomic and financial programme. At this point in international relations, \r\nwe cannot imagine that a State like Peru can exist without coherence among \r\nthose three factors. Without this, we would be under constant threat from \r\nfragmentation of soverignty which has already done damage in other parts of \r\nthe world or from harsh limitations of sovereignty resulting from the \r\ninterventionist nature of the new global challenges and the consequences of \r\nhasty multilateralism. \r\nWe view regional action as relevant, because we consider that the future \r\nof the multilateral system is based on the development of trustworthy regional \r\norganizations. These must play a growing role in the promotion of democracy, \r\ni\" fostering development, in overcoming conflicts, in supplying humanitarian \r\nassistance and in maintaining peace. \r\nA / 4 7 / P V . 1 6 \r\n70 \r\n(Mr. Luna. Peru) \r\nIn our region, Peru is working to ensure that the Organization of \r\nAmerican States will play its new role and go beyond the rituals of rhetoric \r\nand ostracism. We cannot continue to hold back a hemispheric organization \r\nwhose work must be based on solidarity and must be effective to address the \r\nfundamental issues that threaten democracy and development. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n71 \r\n(Mr. Luna. Peru) \r\nThe democratization of international relations can be achieved in a \r\nnumber of ways. Peru believes that one of the most effective of these is the \r\nstrengthening of regional organizations, which are ideal forums for dealing \r\nwith any substantive issue. All the situations that now call for speedy and \r\neffective action are the legacy of the dynamics of the cold war. Today we \r\nneed imaginative solutions that combine the global vision of the United \r\nNations with contributions by regional bodies. This is no easy task, because \r\nboth approaches require the political will of Member States; but given the \r\nuncertainty of international relations, that will must consistently be made \r\nmanifest in all bodies where States come together, as is obviously the case \r\nwith the wide range of neighbourly relations we enjoy within our Organization. \r\nThe Government of Peru shares the desire of the Government of Ecuador, \r\nexpressed by the President of that country, Mr. Duran Ballen, in his statement \r\nlast Friday. He spoke about the need to promote joint development between the \r\ntwo countries. In this context, and bearing in mind the fact that Peru gives \r\npriority to the strengthening of its fraternal bonds with Ecuador, \r\nPresident Alberto Fujimori in November 1991 put forward a proposal for \r\nfriendship, cooperation and integration. This proposal was aimed at \r\nreorienting bilateral relations to reflect the desires of our peoples to \r\nstrengthen good-neighbourly relations and development. \r\nPeru is convinced that the common will for understanding expressed during \r\nthe State visit by President Fujimori of Ecuador in January 1992, as well as \r\nin the interview with President Duran Ballen in Quito last August, when he \r\nassumed the presidency of Ecuador, will continue in further meetings between \r\nthe two Heads of State, making it possible gradually to harmonize our \r\nrespective positions and to deepen our relations. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n72 \r\n(Mr. Luna. Pern) \r\nAs is well known, the crisis in Peru has reached an extreme because of \r\nthe actions of terrorist groups and as a result of our dire economic \r\nsituation. But we must avoid simplistic interpretations which maintain, for \r\nexample, that ours is an ethnic problem pitting an indigenous population, the \r\ndescendants of defeated Incas, against a political class descended from the \r\nSpanish conquistadors. This interpretation is thought-provoking and linear \r\nbut inaccurate. Exploitation of man by man is a historic fact which many \r\ngenerations of Peruvians have striven to cancel out. But it is also a \r\nstruggle to reconcile characteristics of an idiosyncracy rooted in a profound \r\nand extensive mixing of races - characteristics that at times may clash but \r\nthat at others can mesh fraternally throughout the breadth of Peru, fragmented \r\nas it is by its topography, and to the depth of the baroque culture of this \r\nthe oldest nation State of South America. \r\nThe cumulative ancestral problems of five centuries have given rise to a \r\nsocial breakdown which may now be called historical. To this unstable legacy \r\nare now added new challenges, including a quarter of a century of economic \r\nstagnation and internal migration, with its accompanying demographic explosion \r\nand mushrooming slums, and culminating during the past decade in \r\nnarco-terrorism. Quite naturally, this has produced a tacit alienation \r\nbetween the State and society and as a result rightly or wrongly people \r\nhave perceived the State as an obstacle or impediment instead of as a \r\nguarantee of meeting the basic needs of society. \r\nIn the face of these challenges, an ambitious and difficult programme to \r\nput the country\u0027s economy and finances on a healthier footing was begun in \r\n1990; it is now on the verge of bringing economic recovery and renewal of the \r\nState apparatus. An anti-terrorist strategy culminated a few days ago in the \r\ncapture of the founder of the terrorist group Shining Path. \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n73 \r\n(Mr. Luna. Peru) \r\nThe conciliation Peru now seeks between its ancestral culture and the \r\nmodern-day exigencies of competition is not impossible. It can be achieved by \r\nmodernizing the economy and public institutions and by eliminating insecurity \r\nthrough joint efforts of the State and society against terrorism. What is \r\nneeded is a representative democracy that is more attentive to the real \r\nimmediate interests of the people, along with institutions that can guarantee \r\nan efficient dialogue between the State and society. This civic progress can \r\nbe successfully made through a modern parliament, through integrity and \r\nefficiency in the administration of justice, and through the constant efforts \r\nof the political classes, both new and traditional, in order to surmount the \r\ncountry\u0027s problems in light of reality rather than of doctrine. \r\nAt this complicated juncture Peru does not stand alone. It has enjoyed \r\nthe understanding of other countries in the hemisphere and the thoughtful \r\nsupport of countries in other parts of the world. The understanding reached \r\nwith regard to Peru\u0027s problems in the Organization of American States \r\nrepresents a historic landmark in the work of that organization and augurs \r\nwell for its intelligent and dynamic responses to future challenges. \r\nThe decision to respond positively to Peru\u0027s request for technical \r\nsupport and to send observers to the elections to be held in November is the \r\nexpression of a joint effort to interpret, in a definite and transparent \r\nmanner, the desires of the people and the Government of Peru to elect a \r\nconstituent congress which will lead to new institutional viability for our \r\ndemocracy. \r\nThe Shining Path obsession has not only divided the country but created \r\nantagonisms between the State and society, destroying both and creating \r\ninstead a totalitarian response to the national crisis. The various stages \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n74 \r\n(Mr. Luna. Pen.) \r\nof the Shining Path, stripped of anecdote and rhetorical effect, began with \r\nthe exploitation of a short-lived and fairly confined Andean uprising, \r\nfollowed by coercive recruitment, employing intimidation and violence against \r\npeasants. In this context, given the movement\u0027s tenuous strength in the rural \r\nareas, it launched an assault on the cities, carrying out fierce \r\nassassinations of true urban leaders and bombing civil targets. \r\nDuring recent stages, the Shining Path had already established an \r\nunnatural alliance with Peru\u0027s most powerful and illegitimate transnational \r\nforce, drug trafficking. It had filled the growing popular vacuum with its \r\nradicalized violence, taking new terrorist forms to extremes and moving from \r\nthe countryside, where it had never taken root, to the city in a so-called \r\n\"strategic step\" which only the narcissistic cult of its leadership could \r\nsustain. This final stage of self-intoxicated obstinacy was the beginning of \r\nthe end. \r\nSociety reacted. From apprehension and despair, we moved silently to \r\nindignation and took the offensive, making it possible to create an atmosphere \r\npropitious to the recent capture of the founder of this Utopian movement that \r\nPeru considers to be the antithesis of its nationality. While it would be \r\noverly optimistic to say that we are approaching the light at the end of the \r\ntunnel, we can indeed perceive the fresh air of a new era of hope. \r\nThe Peruvian people have overcome their paralysis and are now taking \r\naction against terrorism. Now that its genocidal practices have been \r\nuncovered and the Shining Path is being stymied by the renewed thrust of \r\ndemocracy in Peru, the efforts of the hemisphere must lead to international \r\ncooperation. In essence wnat we are trying to do is to promote the most \r\neffective integration of Peru into the world economy; at the same time, we \r\nA/47/PV.16 \r\n75 \r\n(Mr. Luna. Peru) \r\nmust contribute to the country\u0027s internal security and cooperate in the \r\ndismantling of external agents who are still promoting terrorism in this \r\nnation. Here, in a word, lies the solidarity demanded by Peru and which the \r\nCharter requires of us, the United Nations. \r\nThe meeting rose at 12.50 p.m. \r\n"
