President of the Republic of Haiti, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic of Haiti, \r\nHis Excellency the Reverend Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\nPresident ARISTIDE (interpretation from French): In the name of the \r\npeople of Haiti, I am happy to greet you, Sir, and offer you our warm \r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-seventh \r\nsession of the General Assembly. \r\nI am equally pleased to salute your predecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi, and \r\nthe new Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to whom I extend my most \r\nsincere congratulations on his assumption of his position of weighty \r\nresponsibility. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n6 \r\n(President Aristide) \r\nHow happy I am to greet you and to welcome the sisterly nations that have \r\njust arrived in this great family of ours! \r\nAs always, the Haitian people cannot refrain from sending special \r\ngreetings to President Carlos Andres Perez and the Venezuelan people. \r\nOn the threshold of the third millennium, the clear signals of political \r\npollution invite us all to dialogue in order progressively to bring about a \r\ncivilization founded on peace. \r\nThe end of the cold war has offered the world new prospects of peace and \r\ncooperation. Nevertheless, hotbeds of tension and the outbreak of new \r\nregional conflicts have darkened the picture of international relations. \r\nPolitical pollution at a global level has produced armed conflicts, wars, \r\nmassacres and coups d\u0027etat against democracy. Therefore, in all humility we \r\nwould like to share with you eight democratic beatitudes for a civilization of \r\npeace. \r\nThe first democratic beatitude: Blessed are those who defend democracy; \r\nmay peace prevail among them. The condemnation of the coup d\u0027etat of \r\n30 September 1991 is an expression of the desire of the United Nations to \r\ndefend the democratic principles and rights of the Haitian people, and we \r\nwould like to thank you warmly for that. \r\nThe advent of this civilization of peace, on a global level, necessarily \r\ninvolves restoring constitutional order to Haiti, where blood is flowing, \r\ncorpses are piling up and repression is intensifying. \r\nA coup d\u0027etat in itself is a crime against humankind. These 12 months \r\nare symbolic of a double crime against humankind. May the door allowing for a \r\nreturn finally be opened so that peace can once more shine among us. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n7 \r\n(President Aristide) \r\n(spoke in Creole*) \r\n(continued in French) \r\nFive days before the coup d\u0027etat of 30 September 1991, here, at the \r\nUnited Nations forum, the people of Haiti cried out: \"Democracy or death!\" \r\nToday, on behalf of the 3,000 people assassinated by the enemies of \r\ndemocracy, the Haitian people cries out, with the same conviction and from the \r\nsame rostrum, the same cry: \"Democracy or death!\" Anyone desirous of peace \r\nmust defend democracy. \r\n(spoke in Creole*) \r\n(continued in French) \r\nMay peace return to Haiti! \r\nAnd may peace, likewise, be restored to Yugoslavia and Somalia. The \r\nRepublic of Haiti condemns the acts of terrorism and genocide that have \r\nbrought about such a paroxysm of horrific deeds. We appeal to the \r\ninternational community to make itself responsible for progressively creating \r\na civilization of peace. \r\nSecond democratic beatitude: Blessed are those who promote economic \r\ngrowth, because peace and economic poverty are incompatible. \r\n(spoke in Creole*) \r\n(continued in French) \r\nSince the Second World War, global production fell for the first time, by \r\n0.5 per cent last year. In developing countries, economic and social \r\n* The representative did not provide for interpretation into one of the \r\nlanguages of the General Assembly as required by rule 53 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n8 \r\n(President Aristide) \r\nconditions have deteriorated dramatically. Hence subhuman poverty, drug abuse \r\nand an increase in crime. \r\nTwenty per cent of the wealthiest people in the world have 83 per cent of \r\nthe world\u0027s income, while 20 per cent of the poorest people in the world have \r\nonly 1.4 per cent of world income. Today, 1.2 billion poor people live in the \r\ndeveloping countries; in the year 2000, they will number 1.3 billion, and in \r\nthe year 2025, 1.5 billion. \r\nBut the fundamental principle of international public law is the \r\nprinciple of equality. In this context, Aristotle reminds us that politics \r\nrequires a reciprocal and symmetrical relationship in which citizens are \r\nplaced on an equal footing with each other and not above or below each other, \r\n(spoke in Creole*) \r\n(continued in French) \r\nLikewise, in his work entitled Political Justice. Hoffe, while occupying \r\nthe Chair of ethics and political philosophy, has reminded us that \"on the \r\nwhole, Plato and Aristotle offered us a florilegium of reasons to demonstrate \r\nthat life in common is profitable to all those participating in it\". \r\nRelationships, therefore, are ruled by laws: laws that must be \r\nrespected, laws that must not be transgressed, laws in a society of law. \r\nJustice must be, as it were, the oxygen of the economy. \r\nHow can we bring about a civilization of peace unless there is human and \r\neconomic growth at the world level? \r\n* The representative did not provide for interpretation into one of the \r\nlanguages of the General Assembly as required by rule 53 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n9-10 \r\n(President; Aristide) \r\nIt is in this world where, unfortunately, every year almost 3 million \r\nchildren die from vaccine-preventable illnesses. One out of three children \r\nsuffers from serious malnutrition. Why so much suffering? Must suffering and \r\nopulence be necessarily at daggers drawn? \r\nThe South accounts for 77 per cent of the world\u0027s population, but has \r\nonly 15 per cent of the world\u0027s earnings. In Latin America, 17 per cent of \r\nlandowners control 90 per cent of the land. \r\nHow can one speak of peace when equal civil rights become socio-economic \r\ninequality? That is a bitter contrast; that is a startling contradiction, \r\nowing to violations of human rights. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n11 \r\n(President Aristide) \r\nIn our country Haiti it is even worse. The exploitive structures \r\nthat we inherited must be democratically transformed into structures made up \r\nof participation and justice participation by everyone; justice for all; and \r\ntransparency in all matters. \r\nHence, we will no longer be burdened by this colonial heritage that is so \r\nclearly reflected by the following statistics: \r\nOver 45 per cent of the national revenue is in the hands of 1 per cent of \r\nthe population; there are 1.8 doctors for each 10,000 inhabitants; there are \r\n1.9 nurses for each 10,000 inhabitants; in our 56 so-called hospitals, there \r\nare but 1.5 beds for each 1,000 sick persons; 59 per cent of urban dwellers \r\nand 3 per cent of rural dwellers have access to drinking water; 85 per cent of \r\nthe population is illiterate, yet extremely intelligent. \"Illiterate\" does \r\nnot mean \"stupid\". \r\nIncumbent on us is the great responsibility to promote productive gainful \r\nemployment. We will manage to do so by applying judicious macroeconomic \r\npolicies and effective mesoeconomic measures. \r\nTherefore, as always, we will have to locate the human individual in the \r\nvery heart of development, enable the market to function properly, remedy any \r\ndefects, introduce material infrastructures, support activities of public \r\ninterest, develop harmonious relations with the private sector and struggle \r\nagainst corrupt structures. \r\nThe constitutional process will safeguard participation for all and \r\njustice for all. Unity in diversity is indeed the very outline of a political \r\ntopology in which differences of view can be democratically harmonized. \r\nThe more equality there is in civil rights, the less inequality there \r\nwill be in the socio-economic field. I repeat: the more equality there is in \r\ncivil rights, the less inequality there will be in the socio-economic sphere. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n12 \r\n(President. Aristide) \r\n(spoke in Creole*) \r\n(continued in French) \r\nThe Republic of Haiti shares the suffering of those peoples who are \r\nimpoverished, starving and abandoned. There are many of those dispossessed \r\npeople who are in vain seeking the return of what is due to them. \r\nIn addressing our thanks in advance to all those friends of Haiti who \r\nwish to send humanitarian aid to Haiti, we would like to ask you to coordinate \r\nthe channelling of humanitarian aid with the constitutional Government of the \r\nRepublic of Haiti and those non-governmental organizations that are \r\naccompanying the march of the people of Haiti towards democracy. \r\nDespite the controversy that has surrounded the idea of an embargo, the \r\npeople of Haiti would like to repeat \u0027Yes\u0027 to an embargo. Let us have a real, \r\ntotal and complete embargo at last. Secondly, let us put a stop to the flood \r\nof new weapons being pumped continually into Haiti. Thirdly, if a total \r\nblockade is required to achieve this, the Haitian people will welcome it. For \r\nall those efforts that you have already made and for the support that you \r\nintend to give us, may I thank you from the bottom of my heart. \r\nOne year is too long; twelve months is too long, \r\n(spoke in Creole*) \r\n(continued in French) \r\nThe third democratic beatitude is: Blessed are those who heroically say \r\nNo to getting off scot-free; No to vengeance; Yes, to justice. \r\n* The representative did not provide for interpretation into one of the \r\nlanguages of the General Assembly as required by rule 53 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n13 \r\n(President Aristide) \r\n(spoke in English) \r\nNo justice, no peace! \r\n(spoke in French) \r\nThe refusal to give one\u0027s blessing to impunity is part of the lexicon of \r\njustice and morality. Article 42.3 of the Constitution of the Republic of \r\nHaiti lays down that \r\n\"Abuses, acts of violence and crimes perpetrated against civilians \r\nby a military official in the exercise of his duties shall come under the \r\nauthority of the Courts of common law\". \r\nIn less than one year, 3,000 persons have been assassinated; there have \r\nbeen over 40,000 political refugees; hundreds of thousands of citizens have \r\nfled throughout the country, more than a hundred journalists have fallen \r\nvictim to the terror of the military; the press has been muzzled, priests have \r\nbeen arrested, beaten up and imprisoned, the life of Monsignor Willy Romelus \r\nhas been threatened; priests, nuns and members of grass-roots ecclesiastical \r\ncommunities or Ti Legliz have been continually persecuted. Rural, popular, \r\nsocio-professional and trade union organizations have been systematically \r\ndismantled or targeted. Many parlementarians have been persecuted. One \r\nDeputy was assassinated in cold blood. Blood is flowing; the corpses are \r\nbeing heaped up. Never has Haiti experienced such a ferocious and bloody \r\ndictatorship. \r\nRejected by all States of the world, these criminals have nevertheless \r\nbeen recognized, by the Vatican the only State that has elected to give its \r\nblessing to crimes that it should have condemned in the name of the God of \r\njustice and peace. What a scandal! \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n14-15 \r\n(President Aristide) \r\nBecause of this impunity, on 2 June 1992 these criminals burned down the \r\nLafanmi Selavi orphanage. On 5 February 1991 these same criminals burned four \r\nstreet-children and destroyed their orphanage. On 11 September 1988, these \r\nsame criminals burned down St. Jean Bosco\u0027s Church, killing some 50 human \r\nbeings in broad daylight while they were celebrating the Eucharist. \r\nThey have destroyed human lives. But they will never, never be able to \r\ndestroy our love. Let the force of love banish the shades of hatred so that \r\nthe beacon of peace may shine through. \r\nIn the light of this peace, in which, as Anaxagoras said, \"the visible is \r\na window on the invisible\", one may well wonder: what would the attitude of \r\nthe Vatican have been if Haiti had been inhabited by white people? Secondly, \r\nwhat would the attitude of Pope John Paul II have been if Haiti had been \r\nPolish? Thirdly, next October Pope John Paul II will be a few kilometres away \r\nfrom Haiti. Will he be the Good Samaritan or the High Priest? \r\nSt. Luke 10:30-37. \r\nIn the meantime, love and peace to the Pope, because we gain no merit in \r\nloving only those who love us - Luke 6:32. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n16 \r\n(President Aristide) \r\nThe fourth democratic beatitude: Blessed are those who reduce arms \r\nexpenditures and increase expenditures for human development. \r\nWorld military expenditures add up to $2 million per minute. Since 1945 \r\nthere have been approximately 150 wars, which have caused a total of \r\n20 million deaths. The developing countries\u0027 military expenditures have \r\nincreased over the last three decades from $24 billion to $173 billion. \r\nPeace is promoted by reducing the arms purchases and increasing \r\nexpenditures on human development. Unfortunately, in our country military \r\nexpenditures have led not to peace but to the massacre of a non-violent \r\npopulation. An army of 7,000 men accounts for 40 per cent of the national \r\nbudget. Striking contradictions! That is not to mention drugs; some officers \r\nare implicated up to their necks in drug trafficking, a source of corruption \r\npar excellence. \r\nIn the face of so much corruption, millions of victims seem to be echoing \r\nCicero when he asked, \"Ouousque tandem abutere. Catilina. patientia nostra?\": \r\n\"How long will you continue to abuse our patience, Catilina?\" The people have \r\ncategorically rejected that army. We have no need of it, they constantly \r\nrepeat. \"Police, yes, but this army of criminals, no\" they say to anyone who \r\nwill listen. \r\nIn keeping with the Constitution, we, the President of the Republic of \r\nHaiti, respond to the people in these terms: Yes to the army, but the army as \r\nit is, no. The army should be freed from Cedras and his clique, who have been \r\nresponsible for the death of several thousand people. Once liberated, it will \r\nbe integrated and brought up to professional standards, and, in accordance \r\nwith the Constitution, we shall set up a police force separate from the army. \r\nSo much, then, for preserving peace. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n17 \r\n(President Aristide) \r\nA constitutional and democratic State excludes despotism, tyranny, \r\nanarchy and absolute power, because absolute power corrupts absolutely. \r\nThe Republic of Haiti would be very happy to see the United Nations set \r\nup commissions made up of defenders of individual rights to inquire into \r\nviolations of fundamental rights committed since 30 September 1991. Their \r\npresence in Haiti is essential to extend our good experience during the \r\nelections of 16 December 1990. \r\nLet the United Nations and the Organization of American States meet \r\ntogether in Haiti, urgently, so that finally fine-sounding resolutions can \r\nyield visible and fruitful action. \r\nThe fifth democratic beatitude: Blessed are those who resist political \r\npollution, for they will make the sun of peace shine. \r\nDeliberate injustice creates two parallel paths: submission and \r\nresistance. We, the sons and daughters of Dessalines, Toussaint Louverture \r\nand Charlemagne Peralte, say no to submission and yes to resistance. \r\nTolerant towards the intolerant, non-violent towards the violent, \r\nflexible towards the intransigent, the Haitian people must make their \r\nresistance and mobilization for liberation more dynamic in order to pave the \r\nway for a democratic society. \r\nYes, sons and daughters of freedom. \r\nSons and daughters of dignity, \r\nWe reject submission. \r\nWe choose resistance. \r\nThe broad highway of resistance will once again lead us to political \r\nstability, a prerequisite for economic development. From February 1991 to \r\nSeptember 1991 we had seven months of peace; seven months of political \r\nstability; seven months of \"lavalasian\" security! \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n18 \r\n(President Aristide) \r\n(spoke in Creole*) \r\n(continued in French) \r\nThose seven months of security, of course, made it possible for us to obtain \r\n$511 million in gifts or loans from 15 international donors. \r\nI pay homage to the women of Haiti, who, through their spirit, were able \r\nto make more dynamic the teaching of resistance, \r\n(spoke in Creole*) \r\n(continued in French) \r\nThrough active, non-violent resistance, let us mobilize energetically to \r\ndefend human rights. Contempt for human life imperils everything our Haiti \r\nand all humanity hold dear, \r\n(spoke in Creole*) \r\n(continued in French) \r\nPerseverance, said Plutarch, is invincible. Resistance, we say, is \r\norganic. \r\nThe Republic of Haiti offers encouragement to all those men and women on \r\nthe five continents who are resisting the forces of conflict. \r\nWe have been following closely the Middle East peace negotiations and \r\nhope that they will result in a peace agreement, which all men and women \r\nurgently need. \r\nSixth democratic beatitude: Blessed are those who defend the truth, for \r\nthey are a source of justice and peace. \r\n* The representative did not provide for interpretation into one of the \r\nlanguages of the General Assembly as required by rule 53 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly. \r\nN, \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n19-20 \r\n(President Aristide) \r\nIndeed, truth remains the foundation of justice. Man can use science to \r\nkill truth or feed truth, and the same is true of political power. When \r\nleaders seek truth through objectivity they contribute to the maintenance of \r\npeace. \r\nEconomic and anti-democratic forces can follow a strategy that is able to \r\nmanipulate the information sector, thus spreading an oppressive \"truth\". \r\nTherefore, ethics must rise up to oppose any manipulation of the truth or any \r\nacceptance of a polluted truth. \r\nFor us Haitians, men and women alike, our existence is linked to the very \r\nroots of our being. Those roots bring us the sap of the naked truth, of \r\nethnic identity and of nourishing dignity. The same is true of our \r\n\"lavalasian\" policy. We take from it the sap of liberating truth and \r\ndemocratic ethics. \r\nFrom Socrates to Heidegger, from Hegel to Jean-Paul Sartre, over and \r\nabove philosophical differences, our political ethic makes it essential for us \r\nto seek truth from the very source of objectivity, for a peaceful \r\ncivilization, within the truth. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n21 \r\n(President Aristide) \r\nThat is why we chose a constitutional democracy and not a schizophrenic \r\ndemocracy with its implications of psychopathic breakdown, structural \r\ndislocation, verbal stereotypes, and hypertrophy of the collective super-ego. \r\nAs always, we need a political psychology that furthers social peace and the \r\nrealization of national interests. National interests yes! The interests \r\nof the country - yes! The interests of the nation - yes! The interests of \r\nthe nation compel us to transcend personal relationships in order to save the \r\nnation. This can be seen today in the determination of over 90 per cent of \r\nthe Haitians to continue to say \"No!\" to the usurpers after 12 months of \r\nresistance. This can be seen in the determination of the Haitian diaspora -\r\nor the \"tenth department\" which today, heroically and proudly, has taken to \r\nthe streets. They are over 100,000 strong at this very moment, for that is \r\nhow they say \"Yes!\" to democracy. \r\nTheir will our will is to defend not individual interests but the \r\ninterests of the nation. It is noble to die for flag and fatherland! Yes, it \r\nis noble to die for flag and fatherland! \r\n(spoke in Creole*) \r\n(continued in French) \r\nThe sun of this peace will shine in many countries. The Republic of \r\nHaiti joyfully welcomes the presence of the United Nations in Cambodia, where \r\nthere is such a thirst for justice and peace after two decades of war and \r\nisolation. It will shine one day in the Caribbean and Latin America. During \r\nthe first 100 years following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in America, \r\nwe lost more than 90 million human beings. This was the start of the practice \r\n* The representative did not provide for interpretation into one of the \r\nlanguages of the General Assembly as required by rule 53 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n22 \r\n(President Aristide) \r\nof genocide. May the blood of our ancestors fertilize the Caribbean and \r\nAmerica. May their spirit fortify us and guide us towards the triumph of the \r\ncivilization of peace. \r\nThe seventh beatitude of democracy: Blessed are they who, regardless of \r\nclass and race, love one another the Lavalas way. When the black man does not \r\nlive in peace, the white man cannot enjoy his peace. When the white man does \r\nnot live in peace, the black man cannot enjoy his peace. Let us love one \r\nanother the Lavalas way. May the peace of the blacks be with the whites! May \r\nthe peace of the whites be with the blacks! When the poor man does not live \r\nin peace, the rich man cannot enjoy his peace. When the rich man does not \r\nlive in peace, the poor man cannot enjoy his peace. Let us love one another \r\nthe Lavalas way. May the peace of the rich be with the poor! May the peace \r\nof the poor be with the rich! \r\nAccording to Aristotle, politics demands a reciprocal and symmetrical \r\nrelationship in which citizens are side by side and not one atop the other. \r\nTo forge unity in diversity, let us love one another the Lavalas way. The \r\naspiration to peace is inherent in human nature. May it fertilize political \r\npraxis, guaranteeing the growth of cultures and respect for human rights: the \r\nright to live in freedom; the right to work; the right to eat one\u0027s fill; the \r\nright of one and all to a seat at the table of democracy. Living in profound \r\ncommunion with our sisters and brothers in South Africa, the Republic of Haiti \r\nvigorously condemns the system of apartheid. It is indeed a modern vestige of \r\nslavery, day after day eroding human dignity. \r\nFinally, the eighth beatitude of democracy: Blessed are they who, on the \r\nthreshold of the third millenium, discover the true face of the Haitian \r\npeople. Freedom, dignity, and pride: These are the values written in letters \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n23-25 \r\n(President Aristide) \r\nof gold on the brow of this heroic people marching with head held high in \r\nquest of peace. Five hundred years ago, our ancestors, in search of peace, \r\nthrew themselves into the sea, abandoning the boats that were carrying them \r\nfrom Africa to the Caribbean. After 500 years, thousands of political \r\nrefugees in quest of peace have taken to the sea because the Haitian prefers \r\nto die on his feet than to live on his knees. \r\nMay the true face of the Haitian people never again never again be \r\nhidden behind the faces of Papa Doc, Cedras, and the tontons macoutes. all \r\nrejected viscerally, democratically, and once and for all by a bare-handed \r\npeople. Freedom! Dignity! Pride! Yes! He or she who knows the Haitian \r\ndiaspora or the \"tenth department\" can say, like Archimedes: \"Eureka!\" \r\n\"I have found it!\" He or she who knows the Haitian people in Haiti can say, \r\nagain like Archimedes: \"Eureka!\" \"I have found it! I have found Haiti, \r\nwhere the roots of freedom planted by Toussaint Louverture are sometimes \r\nfought, sometimes beaten, but never vanquished\". In the name of the people \r\nand its sons and its holy spirit Amen. We will continue to march with every \r\nHaitian in Haiti so that some day we be able to meet and live in real \r\ndemocracy, \r\n(spoke in Creole*) \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe President of the Republic of Haiti for the statement he has just made. \r\nFather Jean-Bertrand Aristide. President of the Republic of Haiti, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n* The representative did not provide for interpretation into one of the \r\nlanguages of the General Assembly as required by rule 53 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n26 \r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued) \r\nGENERAL DEBATE \r\nMr. RAHMAN (Bangladesh): The General Assembly stands poised at a \r\nvital watershed. It is a time of opportunity and challenge, of promise and \r\nuncertainty, of hopes and unfulfilled expectations. In many ways we are \r\nentering new and uncharted territory. We must beat out our own track with \r\ncaution, deliberation and conviction. We must, above all, invoke and nurture \r\nthat spirit of commonality, commitment, innovation and imagination that is so \r\nuniquely manifest today, as we confront together the unprecedented transition \r\nin world affairs. \r\nWe are all conscious of the significance of this moment in history. We \r\nare in the last decade of a tumultuous century and millennium. We are \r\nstraddling the threshold of a new century a new era carrying with us the \r\naspirations of our people for a better, more prosperous, peaceful and \r\nfulfilling life. Three years from now the United Nations will celebrate its \r\nfiftieth anniversary. Our efforts in the interim will surely determine its \r\ncourse for future generations. \r\nThere is no doubt that the United Nations is but a reflection of the \r\nwishes of its component parts. It is in a real sense the collective \r\ninstrument for promoting the interests of all States, weak or strong, rich or \r\npoor, large or small. At the heart of its success or failure is the \r\ncontribution to its purposes and principles that each individual country must \r\nmake. It is the sum total of these individual efforts that is the real \r\nfoundation of the success of the United Nations in maintaining peace, securing \r\njustice and human rights, and promoting the key Charter prerogative of \"social \r\nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom\". \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n27 \r\n(Mr. Rahman. Bangladesh) \r\nI reaffirm today the total commitment of Bangladesh to furthering the \r\nobjectives of the United Nations Charter and the cause of multilateralism. \r\nIndeed, this is a constitutional commitment. In doing so, I would like to \r\nunderscore the dominant theme of my statement: How can a relatively small \r\nState contribute towards making this Organization a viable instrument, capable \r\nof dealing effectively and comprehensively with all aspects of human \r\ndevelopment, be they political, economic, social or environmental? \r\nMr. President, before I proceed further, let me join my voice to the \r\nwell-deserved tributes paid to you. Sir, on your election to the high office \r\nof President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. Your \r\nknowledge and experience will, I am sure, guide us well in these challenging \r\ntimes. I am confident that you will do great honour to the legacy left by \r\nyour illustrious predecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi, of Saudi Arabia, to whom we \r\nare all deeply indebted. \r\nWe extend our warm tribute to the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. He has taken charge and is steering the course of \r\nour Organization at perhaps its most daunting period of renewal, revival and \r\nresurgence. We pledge to him our unstinted support and cooperation in the \r\nfurtherance of his endeavours.* \r\nI would also like to welcome in our midst the many new countries that \r\nhave taken their seat in the General Assembly this year, swelling our ranks to \r\n179 Member States. Most of them represent peoples who have recently gained \r\nfreedom. Their\" presence strengthens not only our common goal for universality \r\nbut adds a new forceful voice that gives meaning to the expression of the very \r\nfirst words of the Charter of the United Nations: \"We the peoples of the \r\n* Mr. Al-Haddad (Yemen), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n28-30 \r\n(Mr. Rahman. Bangladesh) \r\nUnited Nations\". We look forward to working with them in close and friendly \r\ncooperation. \r\nPrevious speakers have discussed at length the nature of the contemporary \r\nworld setting, the massive pressures that have radically changed relationships \r\nbetween States and individuals, and the resulting positive and negative trends \r\nthat have emerged. It is not my intention to repeat this analysis. Suffice \r\nit to say that one paramount task emerges: how to tilt the balance of \r\ncontradictory forces in favour of the evolution of a new, more beneficial, \r\nmore just and peaceful world order. \r\nAt the heart of the issue is the creation of an environment of peace. \r\nIronically, the sources of conflict are rooted in the absence of progress in \r\nobjectives we most seek to promote the enhancement of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, the promotion of sustainable economic and social \r\ndevelopment for wider prosperity, the alleviation of human distress, and the \r\ncurtailment of the existence and use of weapons of mass destruction. \r\nOf real concern to third world countries are certain negative impulses. \r\nA prime factor is continuing anxiety that their interests are being \r\nmarginalized both politically and economically. Insularity and internal \r\ndomestic preoccupations of the major Powers open up prospects of a power \r\nvacuum and of the consequent danger of regional competition and hegemony. \r\nDiversion of resources along an East-West axis can leave the South starved of \r\npolitical resources and investment. \r\nThese fears are multiplied by the emergence of new constraints that \r\ncircumscribe development cooperation standards of good governance, rigid \r\nstructural adjustment measures, environmental criteria and scrutiny of \r\nmilitary intentions and preparedness. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n31 \r\n(Mr. Rahman. Bangladesh) \r\nWhat is basically at issue is a degree of perception. It is not opposition to \r\nthese recognizably needed changes, but resistance to any form of dictation \r\nwith regard to how they should be achieved. A flexible attitude is perhaps \r\nthe best prescription. Too often the role of people has been ignored to the \r\nperil of the world community. One extreme manifestation is that national \r\nself-assertion has resurfaced. It has brought realization to the right of \r\nself-determination, but it has also released long-suppressed ethnic, cultural, \r\nlinguistic and cultural rivalries and has unleashed bigotry, extremism and \r\nviolence. This is at a time when, after years of patient pressure, racism and \r\nracial discrimination were being isolated and apartheid dismantled. They have \r\ngenerated powerful centrifugal forces that threaten established boundaries. \r\nAt the same time, poverty, disease, famine and repression have joined together \r\nto produce a massive movement of people within and beyond national borders \r\n17 million refugees and 20 million displaced persons worldwide all of which \r\nhave combined to create a new dimension of insecurity that must be addressed \r\nin all its ramifications. \r\nThe pre-eminent task before us is to forge a new, more focused and \r\naction-oriented world agenda to promote peace, tolerance, justice and \r\ndevelopment. It is of crucial import that this should be time-targeted, \r\nprioritized, fully-funded and cost-efficient. \r\nThe structure and shape of this agenda has already assumed significant \r\nsubstance. The first-ever summit of the Security Council members took place \r\nin January 1992. The outcome of that meeting concentrated on an agenda for \r\npeace encompassing preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and what \r\nthe Secretary-General characterized as post-conflict peace-building. Other \r\nsubstantial inputs have been made or are envisaged including, inter alia: \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n32 \r\n(Mr. Rahman. Bangladesh) \r\nthe 1990 World Summit for children; the special session of the United Nations \r\nGeneral Assembly on narcotic drugs; the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development; the 1993 summit on human rights; the 1994 \r\nconference on population and development; the 1995 world conference on women \r\nand a world summit for social development. These accompany far-reaching \r\nproposals that are under way to reform, strengthen and streamline the \r\nOrganization to enable it to fulfil its responsibility as the central organ \r\nfor the cooperative management of the world\u0027s problems. \r\nIf the world Organization is to succeed and flourish, it will depend as \r\nmuch on the resilience of its Member States to prosper individually as on \r\ntheir ability constructively to contribute to its great goals and purposes. \r\nPositive efforts by each country cumulatively strengthen the sum total of the \r\nUnited Nations mandate. What then is Bangladesh\u0027s contribution to this grand \r\ndesign? \r\nThe quest for a new world order must begin with putting our own house in \r\norder. In our region, Bangladesh has sought actively to maintain the momentum \r\nand credibility of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation \r\n(SAARC) and by promoting its essentially socio-economic mandate to create a \r\nbroad-based climate of confidence-building, to reduce tension in the region \r\nand to resolve outstanding bilateral differences by dialogue and negotiation. \r\nIt is on us, as Chairman of the forthcoming seventh summit of SAARC, that the \r\nonus of responsibility has fallen to promote these aims in more productive and \r\ntangible ways, especially as SAARC stands poised to enter its second cycle of \r\nannual summit meetinqs. \r\nBilaterally, the democratically elected Government of \r\nPrime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, has initiated concerted steps to bolster a \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n33 \r\n(Mr. Rahman. Bangladesh) \r\nnew chapter of positive interaction with our immediate neighbours, following \r\nyears of inactivity. The upsurge of democracy throughout the region has \r\nsignificantly contributed to this objective. In recent months official visits \r\nby the Prime Minister to Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan have been motivated by \r\none major determinant to eschew past inhibitions and look to the future. \r\nSome issues remain complex and sensitive but approaches to solutions are being \r\nforged through continuing and pragmatic dialogue. \r\nThe exodus of Myanmar refugees to Bangladesh since November 1991 imposed \r\na heavy additional burden on the new government, coming as it did in the wake \r\nof the devastating cyclone of May 1991 and the cumulative adverse impact of \r\nthe aftermath of the Gulf War. The option of confrontation loomed large. Yet \r\nthrough circumspection, restraint and a conscious defusion of tension, the \r\ngroundwork was laid for an eventual solution by mutual agreement in April 1992. \r\nDespite this agreement, some 270,000 Myanmar refugees still remain in our \r\nterritory as efforts continue to repatriate them in honour, safety and dignity \r\nand above all on a voluntary basis. Given the dire compulsions under which \r\nthe refugees fled, the process of persuading them to return is a difficult and \r\ndrawn-out one. Time targets are at best approximate and increase the \r\nliabilities of the Government in terms of costs, environmental damage and \r\ntension with and among the local population. The critical catalyst for \r\nguaranteeing safe repatriation and resettlement remains an impartial United \r\nNations presence. Efforts continue to overcome Myanmar\u0027s reticence on this \r\nscore. Yet, bilaterally the two countries are cooperating positively. I am \r\nhappy to announce that the first minimal step has been taken with the \r\nvoluntary repatriation of some 49 refugees on 23 September 1992. It is hoped \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n34-35 \r\n(Mr. Rahman. Bangladesh) \r\nthis will constitute a crack in the wall towards the voluntary return of the \r\nremaining refugees. \r\nGlobally, Bangladesh supports all measures to strengthen the United \r\nNation\u0027s capacity to prevent war and resolve conflicts and to extend this \r\ncapacity in new and imaginative ways. It is of key importance to preserve the \r\nsecurity of small States and to promote the concept of preventive diplomacy, \r\nespecially to anticipate and contain damage in times of man-made or natural \r\ndisasters. It is a matter of some satisfaction that the role of the United \r\nNations in helping to resolve the Myanmar refugee problem was the first \r\nobjective test of preventive diplomacy in action. The visit of \r\nMr. Jan Eliasson, the Coordinator for Humanitarian Affairs, to Bangladesh and \r\nMyanmar respectively, was to trigger the agreement between the two countries \r\nfor repatriation of the refugees. \r\nWe believe that there is a real chance today that collective security can \r\nbe achieved through promotion of the unrealized premises of the United Nations \r\nCharter, including the fostering of regional security arrangements under \r\nChapter VIII. Regional groupings can and must concentrate on harnessing \r\ndurable structures of stability, starting at the base and working through \r\nconfidence-building measures and broad-based socio-economic cooperation. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n36 \r\n(Mr. Rahman. Bangladesh) \r\nReduced reliance on military security must be buttressed through \r\nmonitoring, regulating and limiting the growing traffic in arms. At the \r\nnational level, doctrines of minimum defence self-sufficiency equated with the \r\ninnovative use of armed forces as human development investment could lead to a \r\nrealistic release of a peace dividend. One recent measure of note in \r\nBangladesh is that budget allocations for defence this year are less than \r\nthose for education. At the same time, we have purposefully contributed to \r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping efforts through the despatch of military and \r\ncivilian contingents to monitor the elections in Namibia, to police cease-fire \r\nlines in the Gulf, to help clear mines and support the restructuring effort in \r\nKuwait, and to assist the United Nations peace processes in Cambodia, \r\nYugoslavia and Western Sahara. We strongly support the strengthening of the \r\nfinancial and institutional base of peace-keeping and its growth in new and \r\nimaginative directions. \r\nWe have striven, through specific initiatives, to participate \r\nconstructively and with moderation and pragmatism in all socio-economic \r\nforums, especially to project the concerns of the least developed countries \r\nand to keep alive the commitment to preferential treatment of the poorest of \r\nthe poor. The critical socio-economic situation in Africa deserves special \r\nattention. \r\nIn Bangladesh we have learnt one fundamental lesson: there is no \r\nshortcut to progress, no matter how reliable or generous our friends may be. \r\nWhether it relates to achieving freedom from political oppression, vindicating \r\nhuman rights or seeking social and economic emancipation, a country must \r\nultimately depend on itself. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Rahman. Bangladesh) \r\nThree conseguent goals have emerged: first and foremost, to bolster \r\nindividual self-reliance and move away from aid-centricity to more defined \r\ndevelopment cooperation; secondly, to intensify South-South cooperation and \r\ncollective self reliance in such specific and practical areas as food \r\nproduction, manpower planning, trade, investments and joint ventures and \r\nmodalities to implement them; and finally, to reactivate constructive \r\nNorth-South dialogue and the creation of an external environment conducive to \r\nthe revitalizing of growth and the targeting, in particular, of the reduction \r\nand elimination of poverty. \r\nThere has been a growing convergence of strategies to redress the \r\ncritical issues of falling investment, reduction and restructuring of debt, \r\ntrade promotion and the transfer of technology. Successful conclusion of the \r\nUruguay Round remains a pressing priority. These goals must be pursued to a \r\nlogical and urgent conclusion. \r\nAnother crucial element must be stressed: the development objective must \r\nbe put in sharper focus than the theme of adjustment that has long \r\novershadowed it; structural adjustment measures are necessary, but must avoid \r\nundue hardships which often lead the poorest sections of the population to \r\nbear a disproportionate part of the burden. \r\nAt home, a crucial policy imperative has been the drawing up of a vision \r\nand strategy for the future that would align participatory democracy with the \r\ncountry\u0027s development needs. This new development perspective focuses on \r\nhuman development, participatory planning, and greater induction and \r\ninvolvement of women in development and the alleviation of poverty. It \r\nrecognizes the need to raise investment so as to achieve growth in excess of \r\n5 per cent per annum, and identifies efficiency improvement as one of the \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n38 \r\n(Mr. Rahman. Bangladesh) \r\nimportant means of attaining this end. It aims at achieving a symbiosis \r\nbetween agriculture and industry that will address the needs of growth, \r\nemployment generation and poverty alleviation. To ensure that this link is \r\nsustained and can lead to a take-off for the economy, investment in the social \r\nsectors is given central importance. \r\nThe factors I have mentioned highlight one basic reality: the fabric of \r\nself-reliance is intimately woven out of three strands democracy, \r\ndevelopment and human rights. \r\nOur own experience has underlined certain basic truths. Without \r\ndemocracy, a people\u0027s potential for socio-economic progress cannot flower. \r\nEqually, without improved standards of living and a vision for the future that \r\ncan sustain hope, democracy will wither. Human rights become meaningless in \r\nthe face of the dire constraints of poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy. \r\nNo other right can take precedence over the amelioration of this condition. \r\nBangladesh fully reaffirms that basic human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms are of universal validity. We believe that a human rights culture \r\nembracing all freedoms must evolve in a uniform way. Perhaps the most vital \r\naspect of this that has yet to find universal acceptance is recognition of the \r\nright to development. Surely, peace and stability cannot be achieved unless \r\nconditions are created to remove the root causes of war and conflict, that is, \r\neconomic and social deprivation. \r\nWe look forward to participating in the second World Conference on Human \r\nRights, in June 1993, and to ensuring that the Conference addresses all \r\naspects of human rights on the basis of universality, indivisibility and \r\nimpartiality. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n39 \r\n(Mr. Rahman. Bangladesh) \r\nSince the only real protection of small and weaker States is firmly \r\nrooted in the rule of law, Bangladesh has constantly striven to promote its \r\nprogressive development and codification internationally and regionally, and \r\nto promote its due reflection at home through enabling legislation. We shall \r\nremain active in pursuing these endeavours, especially in promoting such \r\npriority areas as the non-navigational uses of international water-courses, \r\nthe international law of the sea, environmental protection and the status of \r\nrefugees, economic migrants and displaced persons. No one can doubt the \r\nserious potential for conflict that the absence of law holds in these areas. \r\nThey remain a pressing priority for concentrated movement forward. \r\nThrough national legislation, its regional extension and international \r\nparticipation, we have also contributed to addressing solutions to global \r\nproblems of drugs, terrorism and protection of the environment. We welcome in \r\nparticular the outcome of the Rio Conference, which has addressed the issues \r\nof environment and development, which are inextricably linked. Sustainable \r\ndevelopment calls for a new global partnership, including the provision of new \r\nand additional financial resources to developing countries and adequate access \r\nfor them to environmentally sound technology. \r\nSocial aspects must also remain at the heart of our endeavours, \r\nespecially concentration on disadvantaged groups that the pursuit of economic \r\ngrowth tends to bypass. We therefore wholeheartedly support the convening of \r\nthe World Summit for Social Development. \r\nBangladesh supports the view that the full integration of women in the \r\ndevelopment process at all levels is of critical importance. We stand \r\ncommitted to promoting the success of the World Conference on Women to be held \r\nin 1995. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n40 \r\n(Mr. Rahman. Bangladesh) \r\nEqually, the rights and status of children remain a paramount priority. \r\nThis year the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, along with the \r\nUnited Nations Children\u0027s Fund, is focusing particular attention on the rights \r\nof children in South Asia, in keeping with the commitment of the countries of \r\nthe region to the full implementation of the Declaration and Plan of Action of \r\nthe World Summit for Children. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n41 \r\n(Mr. Rahman. Bangladesh) \r\nNo statement is complete if we do not address ourselves to some of the \r\noutstanding conflict and tension points around the globe. Since the creation \r\nof the United Nations, over 100 major conflicts have taken a toll of some \r\n20 million dead. The cold war imposed its own peculiar threat to security. \r\nWith its demise, vital new possibilities have opened up for forging a new \r\nsecurity regime. The Uniced Nations has emerged as a central instrument for \r\nthe prevention and resolution of conflicts. Bangladesh is determined to \r\ncontribute in whatever ways it can, directly or indirectly, to making it more \r\neffective and responsive in new and creative ways. \r\nI turn now to the critical political issues on our agenda. \r\nBangladesh\u0027s consistent and categorical position on the Middle East \r\nquestion and the issue of Palestine needs no reiteration. We believe the \r\nPalestinians\u0027 cause to be founded on justice. We welcome the convening of the \r\npeace conference and the start of substantive parallel negotiations over the \r\nframework of a peaceful settlement. We believe that this should be \r\ncomprehensive, should include Palestine, and must be based on a serious \r\ncommitment by Israel to abide by Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), \r\n338 (1973) and 425 (1978), and the principle of returning land for peace. It \r\nis our hope that Israel will show sincerity of purpose and greater flexibility \r\nand will refrain from delaying the peace process. \r\nIt is our fervent hope that all parties in Afghanistan will respect the \r\ncease-fire and faithfully implement the Peshawar Accord of April 1992, which \r\nreflected a broad consensus of all Afghan leaders. This would lay the \r\ngroundwork for holding free and fair elections so that a permanent government \r\ncould emerge reflecting the wishes and aspirations of the Afghan people. At \r\nthe same time, it would ensure much needed political, economic and social \r\nstability. There is vital need for the world community to contribute \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Rahman. Bangladesh) \r\ngenerously and actively towards the reconstruction and rehabilitation of \r\nAfghanistan and towards the safe and voluntary return of refugees to their \r\nhomeland. \r\nThe implementation of the 1991 Paris Agreement on a comprehensive \r\nsettlement in Cambodia has progressed apace, despite obstacles raised by one \r\nof the four factions to move into the second phase of implementaiton. We \r\nwelcome this advance and commend the intense and diverse attempts by the \r\nUnited Nations to nurture national reconciliation to foster the democratic \r\nprocess and to build peace and stability. In our own small way, as a part of \r\nthe United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC), Bangladesh is \r\ncommitted to end the suffering of the Cambodian people and to allow them to \r\ndetermine freely their own destiny. \r\nThe vicious cycle of starvation, factional fighting, the break-down of \r\ncentral authority, the violence and the exodus of refugees in Somalia has \r\nshocked the world. The response has been belated. We fully support the \r\nSecurity Council decision to strengthen the United Nations peace-keeping \r\npresence so as to break this cycle through a comprehensive programme of action \r\nthat could reach vital relief assistance, consolidate the cease-fire, curtail \r\nviolence and bring about national reconciliation. We also welcome the efforts \r\nof the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference (OIC) and the Arab League to convene a conference on national \r\nreconciliation and unity in Somalia. \r\nThe upheaval in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a \r\ncause of utmost concern. It has unleashed a bitter mix of conflict, ambition, \r\nhatred and ethnic brutality. The August 1992 London Conference and the \r\nmechanisms it has instituted remain a vital hope for the intensification of \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n43 \r\n(Mr. Rahman. Bangladesh) \r\nthe search for solutions in all aspects and on a continuous basis. Meanwhile, \r\nthe world is appalled by the Serbian aggression in Bosnia and Herzegovina, by \r\nthe massacre of innocent civilians, the systematic persecution and even \r\nannihilation through the abhorrent policy of \"ethnic cleansing\". \r\nBangladesh has taken a forthright stand in all international forums to \r\ncondemn these acts. It has joined in the call for more decisive and resolute \r\naction that would reverse the aggression, stop the brutality, and ensure the \r\nunhindered supply of relief. We have also denied the claim of Serbia and \r\nMontenegro to be the successor State of former Yugoslavia in the United \r\nNations and other international bodies. We believe that much more needs to be \r\ndone to end the bloodshed and fully restore the sovereignty, independence and \r\nterritorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. \r\nWe remain steadfast in our support for the people of South Africa in \r\ntheir struggle to achieve their cherished goal of egual rights and majority \r\nrule. There can be no compromise until we have achieved the complete \r\ndismantling of apartheid. The international community must remain vigilant in \r\nits efforts to bring an effective end to the recent outbreak of violence and \r\ncreate conditions for negotiations leading towards a peaceful transition to a \r\ndemocratic, non-racial and united South Africa. \r\nBangladesh welcomes the intensification of efforts to find a just and \r\nviable solution to the Cyprus problem. We commend the Secretary-General for \r\nhis personal initiatives a»id role in the difficult process of reaching \r\nagreement on a broad-based set of ideas leading towards an overall framework \r\nagreement. We hope that the leaders of the two communities who are to meet on \r\n26 October 1992 will pursue direct and uninterrupted negotiations to reach an \r\namicable and durable solution that will serve the legitimate interests of both \r\ncommunities. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n44-45 \r\n(Mr. Rahman. Bangladesh) \r\nIn Western Sahara, we fully support the Secretary-General\u0027s initiatives \r\nto reactivate the implementation of the settlement plan and to help overcome \r\ndifferences over criteria of eligibility to vote. We hope that the referendum \r\ncan be effectively organized and supervised and thus bring about an early end \r\nto this long-standing dispute. \r\nIn other parts of the third world, bilateral, regional and international \r\nefforts have seen many positive initiatives and advances. It is the combined \r\nsolidarity and sustained moral pressure of the world community that has \r\ncreated a climate conducive to peaceful change. The enhanced role and \r\ncontribution of the International Court of Justice also now assumes much \r\ngreater relevance and credibility and must be strengthened. \r\nLet me say in conclusion that the world has reached a critical point in \r\nits struggle to advance stability and well-being. No doubt violence, \r\naggression, foreign occupation, narrowly conceived nationalism, racial and \r\nreligious discrimination and gaping social and economic disparities still \r\npersist. Yet there is today greater confidence and conviction that a better \r\nworld is truly within our reach. We are faced with an opportunity rare in the \r\nhistory of civilization to carry forward the momentum to resolve disputes \r\npeacefully, to promote partnership and responsible relations among States, to \r\nstrengthen the rule of law and uplift the quality of life of all peoples in \r\ngreater freedom. We must surely move with deliberation towards the \r\nrealization of what the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, calls \r\n\"the vast potential of this unique Organization to bring new life to the \r\nworld of the Charter.\" (A/47/1, para. 170) \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n46 \r\nMr. MANITSKI (Estonia): Let me first convey to Mr. Ganev my \r\ncongratulations on his election as President of this session. His election is \r\na fitting tribute to his personal and professional qualities, and to his \r\ncountry, Bulgaria, which is playing an increasingly important role in \r\ninternational affairs. We wish him success in accomplishing his tasks, and we \r\npledge to him our support and cooperation. \r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the \r\nSecretary-General, Ambassador Boutros Boutros-Ghali, especially for his \r\nefforts to help find peaceful solutions to conflicts throughout the world. We \r\nwish him success and will support him in every way possible in his pursuit of \r\nimplementing the objectives and principles of the United Nations. \r\nWe congratulate and look forward to working with all of the States \r\nrecently admitted to the United Nations. \r\nToday, Estonia\u0027s most vital task is to augment and secure our newly \r\nrestored independence, including further development of our democratic \r\ninstitutions, our economy, our national security and our international \r\nrelations. \r\nI will begin by addressing accusations made here last week regarding \r\nalleged human rights abuses in Estonia by Russian Foreign Minister \r\nAndrei Kozyrev. It is incomprehensible to us that Mr. Kozyrev maintains that \r\nforeign citizens should be allowed to vote in Estonian parliamentary \r\nelections. Mr. Kozyrev\u0027s suggestions that minorities in some countries should \r\nbe placed under United Nations trusteeship puzzles us, since Article 78 of the \r\nsame Charter of the United Nations to which he referred states: \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Manitski. Estonia) \r\n\"The trusteeship system shall not apply to ... Members of the United \r\nNations, relationship among which shall be based on respect for the \r\nprinciple of sovereign equality.\" \r\nIt should be further noted that, according to United Nations documents, the \r\nterm \"minority\" does not apply to foreign nationals, migrant workers and \r\ncolonists. \r\nI would like to take this opportunity to inform the Assembly that Estonia \r\nhas invited a mission from the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights in Warsaw to \r\ninvestigate any and all allegations of human rights violations in Estonia. I \r\ninvite the Russian Federation likewise to invite a similar mission to visit \r\nand review Russia\u0027s recent human rights record, especially with respect to \r\nminority rights. \r\nDuring the year since independence was restored, Estonia has made every \r\neffort to create a State based on equal justice for all. On 21 October 1991, \r\nEstonia acceded to fundamental international agreements protecting human \r\nrights, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, \r\nthe Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political \r\nRights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural \r\nRights. Estonia has embarked on the long and arduous process of updating \r\nlegislation inherited from the Soviet occupation, bringing its laws into \r\ncompliance with international human rights norms. \r\nIn a referendum held on 28 June 1992 Estonian citizens approved a new \r\ndemocratic Constitution. According to its Constitution, Estonia is a \r\nparliamentary republic that guarantees a division of powers and independent \r\ncourts. Elections for a new Parliament and President the first free. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n48 \r\n(Mr. Manitski. Estonia) \r\ndemocratic elections in more than 50 years were held nine days ago, on \r\n20 September, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the new \r\nConstitution. All Estonian citizens, defined by the 1938 pre-Soviet \r\noccupation Law on Citizenship and additional legislation that expanded \r\nenfranchisement, were entitled to vote. These laws also provide a legal basis \r\nfor those people who settled in Estonia as a result of Soviet occupation to \r\napply for Estonian citizenship by naturalization, if they so desire.* \r\nNumerous international experts have concluded that Estonia\u0027s citizenship \r\nlaw is among the most liberal in the world. \r\nEstonia has historically acted as a bridge between Western Europe and \r\nRussia. Relations of good-neighbourliness with Russia, in which both parties \r\nrespect the other\u0027s sovereignty and laws, and strictly adhere to principles \r\nregarding the inviolability of State borders and non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of another State, will allow Estonia to continue its \r\nintermediary role to the mutual benefit of both States. \r\nThe realization of this mediatory role has been complicated by \r\ndifferences between Estonia\u0027s and Russia\u0027s interpretation of the legal status \r\nof the Republic of Estonia. Estonia considers itself to be the same State as \r\nthe pre-Second World War Republic of Estonia, whose legal de jure continuity \r\nwas not interrupted by German occupation or Soviet occupation and annexation. \r\nAll consequences of this annexation are thus ex tunc not valid from their \r\ninception, a view that is shared by nearly all countries of the world. \r\nSeveral pre-war agreements concluded with States that recognize the legal \r\ncontinuity of Estonia have recently re-entered into force. \r\n* The President returned to the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n49-50 \r\n(Mr. Manitski. Estonia) \r\nEstonia also respects the principle of the legal continuity of \r\ncitizenship. Because Russia is the self-styled successor State to the Soviet \r\nUnion, Estonia considers citizens of the former Soviet Union who currently \r\nreside in Estonia as a result of Soviet occupation to be Russian citizens, \r\nunless they have become citizens of another country. \r\nRussia, however, believes that Estonia is a new State, created in 1991 as \r\na result of the disintegration of the Soviet Union, although the \r\ndisintegration of the Soviet Union occurred after the re-establishment of \r\nEstonia\u0027s independence. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. Manitski. Estonia) \r\nThe development of Estonian-Russian relations must be viewed in the \r\ncontext of the development of democracy in both countries. The Estonian \r\nfreedom movement had a positive influence on the democratization of Russia and \r\nother Central and Eastern European countries. Estonia\u0027s declaration of \r\nsovereignty on 16 November 1988 served as a practical example for other \r\nfreedom movements. \r\nIt is interesting to note that Russian democrats, including \r\nBoris Yeltsin, printed their newspapers in Estonia when printing such papers \r\nwas forbidden in Russia, helping to spread democratic ideals in Russia. \r\nA treaty between Estonia and Russia in which both countries recognized \r\nthe other as independent and sovereign States was signed on 12 January 1991. \r\nEstonia considers this treaty to be one of the cornerstones of \r\nEstonian-Russian relations, and places great value on the fact that Russia was \r\none of the first States to recognize the restoration of Estonian independence. \r\nUnfortunately, there are Russian politicians who assert that Estonia \r\nshould not be considered separate from Russia. They hold that Russia has \r\nhistorical and geopolitical claims to Estonian territory and that Estonia has \r\nno right to independence. There is a desire to preserve a Russian military \r\npresence in Estonia at any cost, and to bind Estonia to the Russian Federation \r\nthrough an international campaign which demands Estonian citizenship for \r\nRussian citizens while retaining Russia\u0027s right to be their guardian and \r\nprotector. \r\nHaving been a victim of the Soviet Union\u0027s imperialist policies for more \r\nthan 50 years, Estonia has not only the right under international law, but \r\nalso the moral obligation to demand that Russia withdraw its military forces \r\nand refrain from interfering in Estonia\u0027s internal affairs. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. Manitski. Estonia) \r\nThe need for a withdrawal of Russian armed forces from Estonia is the \r\nprimary stumbling block in bilateral relations between Estonia and the Russian \r\nFederation. While we acknowledge that the leadership of Russia now has a \r\nbetter appreciation of our demands than at the beginning of our negotiations, \r\nEstonia still calls for international support to accelerate the unconditional, \r\nearly, orderly and complete withdrawal of foreign military forces from \r\nEstonian soil. We also appeal for the ex-Soviet military nuclear reactors in \r\nEstonia to be placed under international supervision. \r\nThis is why we are presenting a draft resolution to the General Assembly \r\non the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Baltic States. A similar \r\nresolution was adopted by the recently concluded Summit of the Conference on \r\nSecurity and Co-operation in Europe. This reflects our belief that, although \r\nregional conflicts and disputes should be resolved on a regional basis, the \r\nUnited Nations should be ready to act preventively, and should express its \r\nopinion on matters which may potentially affect the security of a whole \r\ncontinent. \r\nNone the less, I must emphasize that throughout history economic, \r\ncultural and scientific cooperation have played an important, positive role in \r\nEstonian-Russian relations, and Estonia sincerely hopes this cooperation will \r\ncontinue. The integration of both Estonia and Russia into a democratic Europe \r\nwill also help ensure that our relations remain good-neighbourly in the long \r\nrun. \r\nEstonians have strong historical, cultural and linguistic ties to the \r\nNordic countries. These ties, which the Soviet system tried to sever, are now \r\nactively being restored. As an illustration of how quickly bilateral \r\nrelations have changed for Estonia, I would mention that Finland recently \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Manitski. Estonia) \r\nsurpassed the Commonwealth of Independent States as Estonia\u0027s number one \r\ntrading partner. \r\nEstonia embarked on the path of economic reform towards a market economy \r\nat the same time as it launched its political battle for independence. As a \r\ncountry in transition, we have progressed to a situation in which the vestiges \r\nof the command economy have almost been eliminated and the first signs of a \r\nhealthy market economy have appeared. \r\nThe monetary reform carried out in Estonia on 20 June this year was an \r\nimportant step towards a market economy. The sole legal tender in Estonia is \r\nnow the Estonian kroon. Monetary reform has helped establish conditions which \r\nare essential for the progress of privatization. Wide-scale privatization \r\nwill eliminate a situation in which the State helps essentially bankrupt \r\nenterprises remain in business, and will instead promote the development of \r\nnew private enterprises. \r\nWith the close cooperation of international institutions, a great deal of \r\nwork has been done to ensure that we accurately report and measure our \r\neconomic performance through reliable statistics. For this reason, we are \r\nconcerned about how our assessment rate here at the United Nations is \r\ncalculated through the exclusive use of Soviet statistics. Estonian national \r\naccounts and foreign exchange statistics are being ignored. The use of \r\ncurrent methodology means that our assessment is calculated on the basis of \r\npolitical rather than economic considerations. \r\nBoth the Stockholm Initiative and the Secretary-General\u0027s report entitled \r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277) address the need to prevent conflicts before \r\nthey arise. During the past year we have seen how difficult it is to solve \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n54-55 \r\n(Mr. Manitski. Estonia) \r\nconflicts once they escalate to war. Estonia considers preventive diplomacy \r\nto be of the utmost importance. \r\nThe United Nations must have the collective will to become actively \r\ninvolved in the prevention of potential conflicts. This Organization carries \r\nthe burden of history while facing a future full of hope and possibilities. \r\nEstonia is determined to perform its role in helping to create a new Europe \r\nand the new world of tomorrow. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n56 \r\nPrince SAUD AL-FAISAL (Saudi Arabia) (interpretation from Arabic): \r\nI would like to begin by expressing to you, Mr. President, our sincere \r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-seventh \r\nsession of the General Assembly. The trust and confidence bestowed upon you \r\nreflects appreciation for you personally as well as recognition of the \r\npositive role played by your country, Bulgaria, in international affairs. I \r\nwish you success in the pursuit of your mission. \r\nOn this occasion, I would like to congratulate your predecessor. \r\nAmbassador Samir Shihabi, for his effective conduct of the affairs of the \r\nGeneral Assembly during its previous session. \r\nI also would like to acknowledge the continued sincere efforts by the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to enhance the prospects for \r\npeace and reduce the elements of tension which prevail in many parts of the \r\nworld. These efforts and pursuits represent a continuation of the efforts of \r\nhis predecessor, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. \r\nI am pleased to join with the other heads of delegations in welcoming all \r\nthe States which have joined the United Nations this year so that they may \r\nparticipate, along with all other Member States, in realizing the noble \r\nobjectives of this Organization. It is my hope that these States will be able \r\nto play an effective role in the Organization, and contribute positively to \r\nthe realization of peace, security, stability, and development for the benefit \r\nof the international community as a whole. \r\nWe are assembled here in this international forum in which nations, small \r\nand large, powerful and weak, meet on the basis of equality and work together \r\nfor the establishment of right and justice, order and security, prosperity and \r\npeace. We learn from the lessons of the past, to chart a course for the \r\nfuture in an environment of fast-changing global conditions and \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n57 \r\n(Prince Saud Al-Faisal. \r\nSaudi Arabia) \r\ncircumstances. We follow, with great interest, the general trends of what has \r\ncome to be known as the new world order, an order founded upon the principles \r\nof the United Nations and on the tenets of international legality. This order \r\nrejects the use of force in the settlement of disputes. We must understand \r\nthat this order cannot evolve by itself, but requires us to change our \r\nperception of the role of the United Nations. We must develop our methods and \r\npractices in harmony with the basic principles of the Organization, whose \r\npurpose is to replace war ind destruction with cooperation between nations and \r\npeoples and thereby lead to development, respect for the dignity of man, \r\nsecurity, peace and prosperity for our world. \r\nTherefore, it is incumbent upon us to bring about a fundamental change in \r\nour understanding of the role of the United Nations from one of crisis \r\nmanagement and the preservation of peace to one of active participation in \r\npeacemaking. \r\nIn this context, I would like to express appreciation for the proposals \r\npresented by the Secretary-General for enhancing the role and effectiveness of \r\nthe United Nations. His Agenda for Peace which contained those proposals, \r\ndeserves prompt attention, objective consideration and thorough study in order \r\nfor us to arrive at an appropriate formula for the functioning of the \r\nOrganization that would be compatible with its desired more effective role. \r\nSubsequently, attention could be given to the introduction of basic structural \r\nand institutional changes, if required. \r\nEven a cursory review of the current international situation would reveal \r\nthat there still remain hotbeds of tension which threaten security and \r\nstability in many regions of the world. It would show too that the role of \r\nthe United Nations becomes increasingly more important concomitantly with the \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n58 \r\n(Prince Saud Al-Faisal, \r\nSaudi Arabia) \r\nincrease in the possibilities and opportunities for cooperation among nations \r\nin enhancing and supporting the Organization so that no nation may commit \r\naggression against or threaten the security, sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of any other nation. \r\nThe United Nations has clearly demonstrated that it is capable of playing \r\nsuch a role when it firmly faced up to the Iraqi aggression against its \r\nneighbour, Kuwait, a peaceful nation that may be small in size but which plays \r\na major role and makes major contributions to the family of nations. By so \r\ndoing, the United Nations was able to liberate Kuwait from a blatant \r\naggression and restore legality to its territory. The image of this noble \r\nstand still remains before us and is indelibly etched in our minds. \r\nOn this occasion, it behoves us to express our appreciation and \r\nadmiration for this role and to emphasize now, more than ever, the need for it \r\nto continue and be promoted, for we have noticed recently the return of the \r\nIraqi regime to the pattern of threats and false claims regarding Kuwait in a \r\nmanner that is reminiscent of that regime\u0027s declarations on the eve of its \r\naggression against Kuwait. In so doing, it makes a mockery of its obligations \r\nunder international treaties and resolutions. It also continues to \r\nprocrastinate in implementing the resolutions of the Security Council and \r\nfails to comply with their stipulations. It has given itself the right, on \r\nthe basis of sovereignty, to starve and humiliate the Iraqi people and subject \r\nIraq to dangers that threaten its unity and security while it goes on \r\nclaiming, falsely and slanderously, that it is the international community \r\nthat is responsible for the dangers that beset Iraq and the miseries of its \r\npeople. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n59-60 \r\n(Prince Saud Al-Faisal. \r\nSaudi Arabia) \r\nWe are totally convinced that the only means of averting instability in \r\nthe region and dealing with the suffering of the people of Iraq lies, first \r\nand foremost in ensuring the complete and comprehensive implementation of the \r\nresolution of the Security Council which reflect the collective will of the \r\ninternational community. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n61 \r\n(Prince Saud Al-Faisal, \r\nSaudi Arabia) \r\nWe have heard, with great concern, the declaration by the United Arab \r\nEmirates that its efforts have failed to achieve a peaceful and amicable \r\nsolution with the Islamic Republic of Iran in relation to the complete \r\nsovereignty of the United Arab Emirates over the three islands of Abu Mousa, \r\nTun the Greater and Tun the Smaller. We express our support for the position \r\ntaken by the United Arab Emirates on this issue and for its demand that Iran \r\nreverse its unilateral actions and that the problem be settled through \r\nnegotiations on the basis of international law and international legality. \r\nThe Middle East is among the regions which attract a greal deal of the \r\ninternational community\u0027s attention and is the focus of its efforts. It is \r\ntime that this region enjoyed its rightful share of peace, security and \r\nstability so that all its energies may be directed towards development and all \r\nits resources may be devoted to ensuring the prosperity of its peoples. The \r\nMiddle East is capable of providing a decent standard of living for all its \r\ninhabitants and has the potential to become a peaceful oasis of stability, \r\nprosperity and creativity. \r\nTo achieve the objectives we desire, it is our vital duty to strive to \r\neliminate the threat posed by the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction \r\nin the Middle East. We therefore welcome the conclusion of negotiations on \r\nthe non-proliferation convention banning chemical weapons. The draft \r\nconvention resulting from those negotiations is before the General Assembly at \r\nits current session. We affirm our support for the objectives of the draft \r\nconvention. This support derives from the great concern of the Kingdom of \r\nSaudi Arabia to make the Middle East a region free from weapons of mass \r\ndestruction of all kinds whether nuclear, chemical or biological. However, \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n62 \r\n(Prince Saud Al-Faisal . \r\nSaudi Arabia) \r\nthat goal can be reached only when all States in the region without exception \r\nrefrain from the production, stockpiling or possession of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction of any kinds. \r\nIt should be noted that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has adhered, both in \r\nword and in deed, to the provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons, and the Arab States have demonstrated the collective will to \r\nadhere to that Treaty as well. It has therefore become imperative that all \r\nStates in the region, including Israel, abide by both the chemical-weapons \r\nconvention and the non-proliferation Treaty, so as to achieve the desired \r\nbalance necessary for peace, security and stability for all States in the \r\nregion. \r\nThe Arab States have expressed a sincere, genuine desire to establish a \r\npermanent, just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. This has been \r\ndemonstrated by their participation in the peace negotiations sponsored by the \r\nUnited States and the Russian Federation. Their positive position in those \r\nnegotiations has proved to be a serious orientation towards ending the \r\nArab-Israeli conflict and towards achieving a just settlement of the \r\nPalestinian question that would ensure the restoration of the legitimate \r\nrights of the Palestinian people on the basis of Security Council resolutions \r\n242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and other relevant resolutions of international \r\nlegality. \r\nIn that context, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has lent its full support to \r\nthe current Middle East peace process. Saudi Arabia believes that no genuine \r\npeace can be achieved in the Middle East unless a permanent, just solution to \r\nthe Palestinian question is reached and unless Israel withdraws from all the \r\noccupied Arab territories, including Al-Quds which is an integral part of the \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n63 \r\n(Prince Saud Al-Faisal, \r\nSaudi Arabia) \r\noccupied Arab territories. The question of Al-Quds has a focal place in the \r\npolicy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and is one of its constant concerns, \r\nwithin the context of the relevant United Nations resolutions and of the \r\nresolutions of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. \r\nThe success of the current Middle East peace process clearly depends on a \r\nserious, genuine commitment by Israel to implement the resolutions of \r\ninternational legality and on Israel\u0027s withdrawal from all the occupied Arab \r\nterritories, including Al-Quds Al-Sharif. \r\nThe Lebanese Government has made considerable progress in the \r\nimplementation of the Taef accords and has adopted the necessary political and \r\nconstitutional measures in that context. We must continue to support the \r\nefforts of the legitimate authorities in Lebanon and contribute to the process \r\nof reconstruction in Lebanon. In that regard, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \r\nappeals to the international community to help facilitate the establishment of \r\nan international fund to assist Lebanon. We must also reiterate the need for \r\nan Israeli commitment fully and unconditionally to implement Security Council \r\nresolution 425 (1978), which calls on Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon \r\nto enable the Lebanese Government to extend legitimate authority over the \r\nentire territory of Lebanon. \r\nThe General Assembly was right in deciding to deny the legality of the \r\nsuccession of the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to the seat held by \r\nthe former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. We view this as a step \r\nin the right direction and hope that other steps will follow with a view to \r\nrestoring peace and stability to that part of the Balkans. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n64-65 \r\n(Prince Saud Al-Faisal. \r\nSaudi Arabia) \r\nThe people of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina are falling victim \r\nto a genocidal war waged by Serbian forces with the support of Serbia and \r\nMontenegro. That genocidal war has claimed thousands of innocent victims and \r\nhas resulted in the displacement of a large portion of the population away \r\nfrom their homes and possessions. My country has already declared its full \r\nsupport for the decisions and resolutions adopted with the consent of all \r\nparties concerned at the recent London Conference on the situation in the \r\nformer Yugoslavia. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n66 \r\n(Prince Saud Al-Faisal, \r\nSaudi Arabia) \r\nWe hope that concerted efforts will be made to ensure the full and \r\nserious implementation of those resolutions. So far, however, we regret that \r\nnone of them has been implemented. We refer to resolutions such as those \r\nconcerned with the placement of heavy weapons and artillery under \r\ninternational supervision; declaring the airspace of the Republic of Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina a no-fly zone for the operations of military aircraft; the \r\nrelease of all prisoners-of-war and detainees; the dismantling of detention \r\ncamps; and the termination of the policy of ethnic cleansing. \r\nOn this issue, the Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques \r\ndoes not believe that ensuring the delivery of humanitarian assistance through \r\nthe United Nations to the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina is sufficient. \r\nRather, we believe that all necessary measures should be adopted to stop all \r\nthe acts of genocide and displacement that are being perpetrated by the \r\nSerbian forces with the support of the Belgrade regime. That requires the \r\nintensification of pressure on the Serbs and their supporters to force them to \r\nabide by the commitments they took upon themselves at the London Conference. \r\nThe creation of a permanent mechanism to monitor the implementation of those \r\ncommitments is very necessary. \r\nWe note with grave concern that there is some hesitation in declaring the \r\nairspace of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina a no-fly zone for the \r\nmilitary aircraft of Serbia and Montenegro. The hesitation ostensibly stems \r\nfrom a concern that such a step would lead to an aggravation of the \r\nsituation. But the situation is extremely grave as it is and cannot get much \r\nworse. The real dangers to be taken into consideration are those which the \r\ncitizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina face, namely, genocide, displacement and \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n67 \r\n(Prince Saud Al-Faisal. \r\nSaudi Arabia) \r\ntorture. All of those constitute the most flagrant violations of the United \r\nNations Charter, the principles and tenets of international law, and the \r\nFourth Geneva Convention. The war that rages there is not even a civil war \r\nbut a war of extermination waged openly on the people of a sovereign, \r\nindependent State whose territory has been occupied by the perpetrators of \r\nthat brutal and savage aggression. \r\nAccordingly, we call upon the Security Council of the United Nations to \r\ntake all necessary measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, \r\nincluding Article 42; starting with the declaring of the airspace of the \r\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina a no-fly zone for the air forces of Serbia \r\nand Montenegro and ensuring the withdrawal of all regular and irregular \r\nSerbian forces from the territories of the Republic of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina. At the same time, we urge the international community to make \r\navailable all possible material, military and moral support to enable the \r\nGovernment of Bosnia and Herzegovina to exercise fully the legitimate right of \r\nself-defence. In the absence of an effective collective security mechanism, \r\nthe arms embargo on the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina should be lifted. \r\nWe are also of the view that those responsible for grave violations of \r\nthe Fourth Geneva Convention should be apprehended and placed on trial \r\naccording to the principles and provisions of international law. We also \r\nsupport the right of the people and Government of the Republic of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina to just compensation from Serbia and Montenegro for the loss of \r\nlife and property they have suffered. \r\nSomalia is currently a nation plagued by disasters and tragedies as a \r\nresult of a destructive ci/il war which has brought upon its people death and \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n68 \r\n(Prince Saud Al-Faisal, \r\nSaudi Arabia) \r\ndisplacement and undermined its unity and territorial integrity. The \r\nGovernment of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques have endeavoured from the \r\noutset of the conflict in sisterly Somalia to contain that conflict invited \r\nall the parties to the conflict to meet on Saudi soil for the purpose of \r\nachieving national reconciliation. Saudi Arabia still exerts all possible \r\nefforts to put an end to that fratricidal conflict. Saudi Arabia also \r\nprovides assistance and relief to Somalia and unequivocally supports the role \r\nof the United Nations in delivering assistance to those who deserve it. It \r\nhas welcomed the dispatch of international forces to supervise operations that \r\nprovide humanitarian assistance to all regions of Somalia. The Kingdom of \r\nSaudi Arabia hopes that concerted international efforts will be made to \r\nprovide all possible assistance and relief to this afflicted nation and \r\nsupports the effort to put an end to the bloodshed. We urge all Somali \r\nfactions to work together towards making their national interest and human \r\nvalues their overriding objective so as to eliminate the causes of conflict \r\nand disunity among them. \r\nAfter 13 years of successful jihad the Afghani people were able to \r\ntriumph over injustice and regain their national identity. On this occasion \r\nwe look forward to the joining of all constructive and sincere efforts to \r\nenable the Afghani people to achieve security and stability in their nation. \r\nWe also look forward to the return of normal conditions throughout \r\nAfghanistan, to make possible the rebuilding of what has been destroyed and \r\nthus to enable the people of Afghanistan to work towards achieving a national \r\nunity that would bring together the various groups and organizations and \r\nprovide a climate conducive to national unity and the deployment of concerted \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n69-70 \r\n(Prince Saud Al-Faisal. \r\nSaudi Arabia) \r\nefforts in pooling all energies and resources for the well-being and in the \r\ninterests of that country\u0027s people. \r\nWe also need to point out that that part of the world is still suffering \r\nfrom the continuation of the Jamu-Kashmir problem, which continues to be an \r\nelement of instability in the region. The Government of the Custodian of the \r\nTwo Holy Mosques believe that a solution must be found on the basis of United \r\nNations resolutions to put an end to this long-standing conflict which has \r\ncast its shadow over relations between the two neighbours, India and Pakistan. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n71 \r\n(Prince Saud Al-Faisal. \r\nSaudi Arabia) \r\nWhile voicing its regrets at the violence South Africa has been \r\nexperiencing over the past few months and the serious setbacks it has caused \r\nto the efforts aiming at ending the apartheid system, the Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia welcomes the recent developments in that country, which revive our hope \r\nfor progress towards the dismantling of that abhorrent system. The Kingdom of \r\nSaudi Arabia supports a major role for the United Nations in offering \r\nappropriate solutions and in working towards the establishment of a society \r\ngoverned by equality and justice. \r\nThe positive changes that have taken place in the international political \r\nsituation are bound to pave the way for addressing the issues of development \r\nand for the creation of an international economic environment that would help \r\nthe developing nations to achieve the sort of economic and social development \r\nthat would enable them to realize the ambitions and aspirations of their \r\npeoples after a better life of peace and prosperity. The developed \r\nindustrialized nations can cooperate in making this possible by opening their \r\nmarkets to the products of the developing nations, ending all protectionist \r\nmeasures, bringing about at an early date a successful outcome to the Uruguay \r\nRound of multilateral trade talks and by finding an urgent solution to the \r\ndebt problem. Economic cooperation between the developing countries \r\nthemselves is also necessary as it would constitute a fundamental tool for the \r\npromotion of international economic growth. \r\nQuestions pertaining to the situation of the world economy are of great \r\nimportance and interest to us in Saudi Arabia, for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \r\nhas a stake in ensuring the stability and soundness of the world economy and \r\nin avoiding the hurdles and pitfalls that may affect its growth. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n72 \r\n(Prince Saud Al-Faisal. \r\nSaudi Arabia) \r\nProceeding from this, it has responded positively to the ongoing \r\ndiscussions on the environment and development and has shouldered its \r\nresponsibility in this respect by participating in the international \r\ndeliberations aimed at finding well-balanced and practicable solutions to the \r\nquestions of climatic change on a sound scientific basis. \r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is convinced that the future of the world and \r\nthe prosperity of all its inhabitants depend on a clear understanding of the \r\nenvironmental problems that face the planet, full understanding of the \r\nconsequences that may result from the policies adopted in dealing with those \r\nproblems, careful weighing of the burdens and commitments taken by the \r\ncountries of the world upon themselves in addressing those problems, special \r\nattention to the situation of the developing energy producers and consumers \r\nalike and careful examination of the effects the policies adopted in dealing \r\nwith the problems may have on the growth of the economies of those countries. \r\nThis would constitute a valuable contribution to the achievement of \r\ncomprehensive development and the raising of the standard of living of our \r\npeoples so that they may enjoy prosperity, peace, security and stability. The \r\ncurrent international situation that has developed from the ending of the cold \r\nwar and the progress achieved in the areas of disarmament and reductions in \r\nconventional weapons, is a rare opportunity indeed for channelling resultant \r\nwindfalls towards solving the problems of development and underdevelopment. \r\nThe international community is on the threshold of a historic new era \r\nwhose challenges and promises are unfolding under our eyes. We are duty-bound \r\nto lay solid and equitable foundations that define the parameters of the \r\nfuture that humanity has always aspired after, a future in which no one would \r\nawaken to the expectation of war or goes to bed haunted by the nightmarish \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n73 \r\n(Prince Saud Al-Faisal. \r\nSaudi Arabia) \r\nprospects of destruction, a future that would melt down the weapons of \r\ndestruction in order to forge the tools of prosperity for all, a future in \r\nwhich the dangers of pollution, the effects of underdevelopment and the pains \r\nof displacement would vanish. We shall never attain such a future unless we \r\nlay the foundations of peace on right and justice. And peace is the essence \r\nof our Islamic faith. As the Holy Koran says: \r\n0 ye who believe! \r\nEnter into Islam \r\nWhole-heartedly; \r\nAnd follow not \r\nThe footsteps \r\nOf the Evil One; \r\nFor he is to you \r\nAn avowed enemy. \r\nMr. FRUTOS VAESKEN (Paraguay) (interpretation from Spanish): First \r\nof all, permit me to express to you. Sir, my congratulations and best wishes \r\non your election to the presidency of the General Assembly in its work at the \r\nforty-seventh session. We are sure that under your intelligent guidance, our \r\nendeavours will achieve the results we all desire. \r\nAlso at the outset, allow me to extend to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, cordial greetings from the Government \r\nand the people of the Republic of Paraguay, and to express our commitment to \r\nsupport him at all times in the difficult task of leading this Organization in \r\nits efforts for peace and international security. \r\nIn welcoming the admission to membership of the United Nations of \r\nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n74-75 \r\n(Mr. Frutos Vaesken.

On the other, we see plans for the integration \r\nof countries which are seeking, by this means, the right direction for \r\nachieving better economic development and trying to find, as in the case of \r\nthe Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), the proper response to the \r\nrequirements of their peoples for a better quality of life. \r\nThe integration of our countries Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and \r\nParaguay through MERCOSUR is something more than a mere strategy for \r\ndevelopment: it is a commitment of peoples with the same origin, with common \r\ncultural, historical, linguistic and religious identities, to share the common \r\ndestiny of nations that were born in a territory of equality and hope. \r\nThe timetable for our fledgling integration process is being met. The \r\nLas Leilas meeting of Presidents on 26 and 27 June 1992 approved and is \r\nimplementing a programme of measures which sets out a process of alleviating \r\nand eliminating customs duties and non-tariff barriers and of requiring the \r\ngradual coordination of macroeconomic and sectoral policies. The recent \r\nsigning of an agreement with the European Community is an important element of \r\nextraregional cooperation for MERCOSUR. \r\nAs part of this same commitment to integration, Paraguay is moving ahead \r\nwith the necessary legal instruments for making better uses of the \r\nParaguay-Paran waterway. This communications link, which has the support of \r\nthe Organization and other international communities, is designed to be one of \r\nthe major river transport routes and an effective instrument for development \r\nby the MERCOSUR countries rnd our sister Republic of Bolivia.* \r\n* Mr. Abulhasan (Kuwait), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n77 \r\n(Mr. Frutos Vaesken. Paraguay) \r\nThe danger of a nuclear conflagration that would jeopardize the very \r\nexistence of mankind has disappeared. Common sense and moral values have \r\nprevailed. Today there are very few cases of armed confrontation in the \r\nworld. Never, perhaps, in its history has mankind enjoyed so much peace as \r\nnow. But history has not come to an end: hunger, disease, lack of education, \r\nintolerance and prejudice continue to affect most parts of the world. If we \r\nlove liberty, if we love democracy, we must find a solution to these \r\nproblems. No state of politics can endure when people do not have the minimum \r\nthey need for a life of dignity. If there is no tolerance, there will be \r\nhatred and resentment. If there is no education, the future of the world \r\ncannot be certain. \r\nNow is the time for continental solidarity. Now is the time for doing \r\naway with prejudices and egoism. Now that the arms race is over, it would \r\nseem that^the most powerful countries are preparing for another war, the \r\neconomic war. Alliances are forming; they are trying to improve their \r\ncompetitiveness. The winner will be the one who produces and sells the most, \r\nwithout regard to the social cost, without regard to the fact that the \r\nproducts of the less developed countries are contantly losing value and that \r\nas a result it is more and more difficult for them to achieve development. \r\nThe expectations the developing countries had for free trade are being blocked \r\nby the barriers of protectionism set up by the industrialized countries, \r\nwhich, paradoxically, are proclaiming the triumph of the free market. \r\nWe need to .seek solutions that will alleviate the tragedy of the \r\ncountries suffering the sc lurge of poverty. We are confident that, thanks to \r\nthe welcome initiative of Chile in calling for the holding of a summit \r\nconference for social development, this will be a suitable opportunity for \r\nachieving world planning to promote the development of the poorest countries. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n78 \r\n(Mr. Frutos Vaesken, Paraguay) \r\nThe hatred, the intolerance and the constant violation of human rights in \r\nformer Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in Somalia \r\nremind us that the battle for peace has not ended. Peace is a gift, and its \r\npreservation requires constant work. Paraguay will support in the strongest \r\npossible terms any action by the Security Council designed to seek a final \r\nsolution to this grave situation, as indeed we voted in favour of resolution \r\n46/242 of the General Assembly. Exacerbated nationalisms, racisms, religious \r\nhatreds and prejudices must disappear from the world if it wants to be more \r\nfraternal and humane. \r\nWe are regarding with particular interest the continuation of \r\nnegotiations to find a final solution to the Palestine question. It is our \r\nhope that these talks will contribute positively towards finding a peaceful \r\nand negotiated, final and lasting solution which would provide, as we have \r\nalready said, for the right of the State of Israel to live in peace within its \r\nown borders and the right of the Palestinian people to its own homeland. \r\nThe United Nations has lent its assitance to the peace process in South \r\nAfrica through the Security Council. It is now up to the Government and the \r\nopposition to find appropriate solutions which provide, courageously and \r\nrealistically, for the possibility of coexistence in a climate of peace, \r\njustice and security. \r\nAs the United Nations enters the new world order that is the fruit of \r\nEast-West detente, its structure and agenda must be reorganized. Social \r\ndevelopment and the maintenance of peace must be its major concerns. It will \r\nbe vital for it to find appropriate machinery to fulfil these aims, and for it \r\nto have t*ie unreserved support of those who can provide their decisive \r\ncooperation. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n79 \r\n(Mr. Frutos Vaesken, Paraguay) \r\nThe \"Agenda for Peace\" proposed by the Secretary-General deserves all our \r\nsupport: it could be the starting point for the search for new structures and \r\nnew paths towards lasting and constructive peace. \r\nWe believe, along wit\u0027n the Rio Group, that international peace and \r\nsecurity will be truly guaranteed only in so far as the underlying causes of \r\nconflicts are eliminated. We therefore reaffirm the vital importance of \r\neconomic and social development in the process of consolidating peace. The \r\ngap reflected in the disparity in wealth between the North and the South must \r\nbe narrowed if we want to avoid a chain reaction of unsatisfied needs leading \r\nto profound crises in developing countries, with the danger of returning to \r\nsystems which we have abandoned and which have caused our peoples so much \r\nsuffering. \r\nWe cannot talk about a future of peace or of sustained development \r\nwithout total respect for human rights. The dissemination of these rights and \r\ntheir constant observance is also a task for the United Nations. Respect for \r\nhuman rights must underpin any process of change. Hence, we welcome the World \r\nConference on Human Rights, to be held in June 1993 in Vienna, and are pleased \r\nat the timeliness of its convening. \r\nFlagrant violations of human rights, such as terrorism, still persist. \r\nOnce and for all we must accept that terrorism is on of the most serious \r\nviolations, attacking as it does fundamental human rights such as the rights \r\nto life, security and patrimony. \r\nJust a few days ago, in this very Hall, we were moved by the words of the \r\nPresident of Colombia about the battle being waged by his people and \r\nGovernment against drug trafficking. Murder, extortion, kidnapping and \r\ncorruption all have their -:oots in the traffic in drugs. Magistrates, civil \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n80 \r\n(Mr. Frutos Vaesken. Paraguay) \r\nservants and anyone opposed to this criminal traffic are under constant \r\nthreat, and many have paid for their ideals, their courage and their dignity \r\nwith their lives. \r\nWe agree with stress laid by the President of Colombia on the \r\nresponsibility of the major consuming centres, and on countries\u0027 obligation to \r\nparticipate in a total war against drug trafficking. As the President said, \r\nwe must have determined, collective international and multilateral action to \r\ncombat this scourge on all fronts. \r\nFive hundred years ago, the imagination and daring of Columbus ushered in \r\na new era. America, a continent of hope, was incorporated into the adventure \r\nof mankind, and it was destined to have a profound effect on the future. \r\nToday, as a coincidence, the world is entering into a new stage that is also \r\npromising and full of hope. It is for this generation to consolidate the \r\nfuture, and for our Organization to ensure that there is peace and to promote \r\nsocial development. \r\nTo mark the quincentenary, the countries of Ibero-America met last year \r\nin Guadalajara, Mexico, determined to make the strength of our community count \r\nin the future. The response was positive, and at the second summit of Heads \r\nof State and of Government of Ibero-America, held this year in Madrid, \r\neffective projects designed to help the Ibero-American peoples were approved. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n81 \r\n(Mr. Frutos Vaesken. Paraguay) \r\nJoint efforts such as those we have mentioned and those promised in the \r\nAmericas Initiative, as well as the solidarity and support that my country has \r\nreceived from other countries such as Japan and Germany, give us hope for a \r\nfuture of concerted effort for the development of those who need it most. \r\nIn the course of this year, my country attended the Earth Summit in Rio, \r\neager to add its efforts to those of the other countries committed to \r\npreserving the environment. We announced measures adopted in this area, such \r\nas the declaration as a protected ecological zone of an area covering about \r\n60,000 hectares of woods, with an indigenous population and natural fauna. \r\nBut what is more, we are currently studying a draft project for the \r\ndevelopment of the western region of my country, with the support of the \r\nEuropean Community, paying particular attention to the preservation of the \r\nenvironment in an area of more than 240,000 square kilometres, which \r\nrepresents more than half of our territory. \r\nThe Rio Conference made it possible for the whole world to become more \r\naware of the relationship between development and the environment. It will be \r\ndifficult to achieve lasting success in the endeavour of bringing about \r\nsustainable development of the Earth if the countries that bear the major \r\nresponsibility for polluting the planet do not make available the necessary \r\nresources. \r\nThe process of democratization in Latin America in this new era was, in a \r\nsense, what triggered the liberation movements in other parts of the world. \r\nToday, in America, with a few exceptions. Governments enjoy a legitimacy \r\nconferred upon them by free and unchallenged elections. The last flickers of \r\nviolence are dying out, and peoples are living in freedom and democracy, with \r\nrespect for human rights. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n82 \r\n(Mr. Frutos Vaesken. Paraguay) \r\nThe civil war in El Salvador is now history. That country, together with \r\nHonduras, has set an example for the international community by taking its \r\ninternational conflicts to the International Court of Justice for settlement. \r\nPeru is once again taking the path of restoring its constitution. In \r\nNovember, it will be holding constituent elections with the participation, at \r\nits request, of an observer mission from the Organization of American States. \r\nWe hope that Peru will find solutions to the grave problems it is confronting \r\nand that we will shortly be able to welcome it back to the Rio Group. \r\nThe Rio Group showed that it is a reliable mechanism for political \r\nconsultation and cooperation, as it demonstrated when the crisis which \r\nendangered the constitution of Venezuela occurred and when it sent a \r\ndelegation which took an active part in seeking to restore full democracy in \r\nPeru. \r\nFurthermore, through the Rio Group, meetings were held and a treaty of \r\ncooperation with the European Community was signed, and meetings were also \r\nheld with countries of the Persian Gulf, Japan, China and Canada. \r\nThe process of regional integration, whose ultimate objective is that of \r\ncreating a vast common economic zone throughout the American continent, has, \r\nin addition to MERCOSUR, made great progress in the form of the Andean Pact, \r\nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and, first and foremost, the North American \r\nFree Trade Association (NAFTA), which is a blueprint for integration that has \r\nalready been agreed upon by the United States of America and by Mexico and \r\nCanada. On behalf of my country, I should like to extend my congratulations \r\nand best wishes for success to those countries. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n83 \r\n(Mr. Frutos Vaesken. Paraguay) \r\nPermit me to speak to you, however briefly, about Paraguay, my own \r\ncountry, which was reborn to democracy and recovered its freedom just four \r\nyears ago. Our President, Andres Rodriguez, in this very Hall, addressing the \r\nGeneral Assembly during the forty-fourth session, said: \r\n\"Paraguay has set its feet firmly on the path of political \r\ndemocracy.\" (A/44/PV.6. p. 21) \r\nToday I can say, with legitimate pride, that the Government of Paraguay \r\nis keeping its promise. My country is living in a legitimate, genuine and \r\nfruitful democracy based on boundless respect for human rights and fundamental \r\nhuman freedoms. \r\nA new national Constitution, effective since 20 June 1992, is now \r\ngoverning the destiny of my country. This is the result of a democratic \r\ndebate in a constituent national convention elected by popular will in free \r\nelections with the participation of all political forces, and was observed by \r\nmembers of international organizations, both governmental and non-governmental. \r\nIn the economic and social realm, my country has continued to make \r\nprogress in consolidating its economy through the process of adjustment and \r\nstabilization. We have liberalized trade, and we are giving priority \r\nattention to regional integration. \r\nOur whole policy of consolidating democracy, accompanied by the necessary \r\nprocess of stabilizing the economy and finances, has been made possible by the \r\ndetermination of the Paraguayan people, who made clear to their rulers that in \r\ntheir country there is no longer room for dictatorship or totalitarianism. \r\nBut just as the Paraguayan people have become the masters of their new \r\ndemocratic and free destiny, we must recognize the determined support of the \r\ninternational community for our process of democratic consolidation and \r\nA/47/PV. 17 \r\n84 \r\n(Mr. Frutos Vaesken. Paraguay) \r\neconomic and financial stabilization. In particular, we should like to thank \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Organization of American \r\nStates (OAS) and the European Community for their cooperation and confidence. \r\nIn conclusion, a few words about the United Nations. As it reaches what \r\nwe might term the first stage of its existence, the balance sheet is \r\nfavorable. Its work for peace has been effective. The near-unanimous opinion \r\nin recommending structural changes to strengthen it and to endow it with \r\ngreater dynamism has as its sole cause the profound changes occurring in the \r\nworld, which call for an Organization more in keeping with new requirements. \r\nTo preserve peace will continue to be its principal task, but with a more \r\nresponsive structure that will help reduce the causes of conflict. The whole \r\nworld, longing as it does for a future of liberty, justice, peace and \r\nsecurity, has placed its trust in the United Nations and its effectiveness. \r\nMr. NATCHABA (Togo) (interpretation from French): The euphoria and \r\nenthusiasm that greeted, no so long ago, the disappearance of ideological \r\nEast-West confrontation and the progressive expansion of freedom and democracy \r\nare today giving way to general discouragement because of the obstacles to the \r\nnatural aspirations of peoples to freedom and legitimate well-being. \r\nThe forty-seventh session of the General Assembly has begun at a \r\nparticularly difficult time in the history of humankind, which means that \r\nMr. Ganev has assumed the presidency of the Assembly in a context of disquiet, \r\nbut also one that is hopeful, because in all likelihood only our Organization \r\ncan help the world to meet these challenges. \r\nOn behalf of the delegation of Togo, we wish to convey to Mr. Ganev \r\nheartfelt congratulations on his election to the presidency of this session. \r\nThe selection of Mr. Ganev, who possesses such great intellectual qualities \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n85 \r\n(Mr. Natchaba. Togo) \r\nand experience, is for his country the true embodiment of the ideals of peace \r\nand justice that it constantly advocates. We will be available at all times \r\nto work with him to ensure the success of his daunting mission. \r\nThe delegation of Togo wishes to pay well-deserved tribute to his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Shihabi, for his outstanding performance in conducting the \r\nwork of the forty-sixth session. His dynamism, his high standards of \r\nexcellence and his zeal for punctuality compelled our admiration and accounted \r\nfor the great success of our deliberations. I reiterate our sincere \r\ncongratulations to him. \r\nWe take this occasion to salute the Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the dynamic work that he has \r\nundertaken since his election to the head of our Organization. The \r\nserious-mindedness and pragmatism he has demonstrated since taking office in \r\nJanuary of this year lead us to believe that the United Nations will be able \r\nto make an even greater contribution to the maintenance of peace throughout \r\nthe world and the promotion of solidarity among nations. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n86 \r\n(Mr. Natchaba. Togo) \r\nIn recent months, the family of the United Nations has grown with the \r\naddition of new Members. We wish to bid them welcome and to say how proud and \r\nhappy the international community is to welcome them to our midst, with the \r\nhope that in keeping with the statements they made upon admission to \r\nmembership they will espouse the San Francisco Charter in its entirety and \r\nwill comply with its fundamental principles. \r\nSince the end of the last session, many events have marked the world. \r\nEfforts have been stepped up to build a new world order which must before all \r\nelse be liberal, because it is based on the absolute need to respect human \r\nrights, which is a fundamental requirement for the establishment of relations \r\nof trust, peace and solidarity among peoples of our planet. \r\nThe turmoil we have witnessed throughout the world, particularly in \r\nEurope, Asia and Africa in recent years, reflects the resolve of peoples to \r\ngain new freedom within which man can become the unchallenged artisan of his \r\nGovernment\u0027s destiny. Throughout the world, peoples are seeking freedom, \r\npeace and justice that only proper multipartite democracy can guarantee. \r\nAmong these are the people of Togo, which for 13 years has been persevering in \r\nthe effort to adapt the structures and the basic choices governing its \r\nsocio-political context to meet the needs of our time and changing attitudes. \r\nHaving broken with the previous regime and gained a constitution in 1979, \r\nour country resolutely committed itself to implementing measures of \r\nliberalization, detente and progressive democratization of our political \r\nlife. These measures inter alia made it possible to hold free elections under \r\nthe second and third legislatures and during municipal and prefectoral \r\nreferenda of 1987, at the jame time as they strengthened protection of human \r\nrights, particularly by setting up an independent commission. \r\nA/47/PV. 17 \r\n87 \r\n(Mr. Natchaba. Togo) \r\nThe subsequent adoption of laws relating to the liberalization of the \r\npress, political pluralism and general amnesty, along with the development of \r\na draft constitution to establish a multipartite regime, shows that already in \r\nthe middle of 1991 the Government and the people of Togo truly desired to move \r\non, without undue haste, to a higher stage in the process of democratizing our \r\ninstitutions. \r\nThe tremendous speed of this movement that was started in the late 1980s \r\nculminated with the National Sovereign Conference of the living forces of the \r\nnation, which led to the transitional Government which was to lead Togo to \r\nelections and establish democracy. \r\nWe must state that one year after the establishment of these transitional \r\ninstitutions the Government has faced enormous difficulties, and that \r\ntremendous efforts must be made before we attain our goals. \r\nThe recent adjustment of the machinery of the institutions of this \r\ntransition, proposed following the consultation meeting between the various \r\nprotagonists of political life and endorsed by the Government and the \r\nlegislature, the High Council of the Republic, overwhelmingly demonstrate the \r\ndesire of the people of Togo to do everything possible to achieve peace and \r\nsecurity, a State of law that they all sincerely want to see, by establishing \r\nnew institutions through free and dependable democratic elections. The latest \r\nof these, the Presidential elections, are to end on 20 December of this year. \r\nThis recent adaptation of the workings of this transitional Government \r\nmeets the needs of our march forward, both by ensuring proper application of \r\nthe constitution for this transitional period, so that no organ be unjustly \r\ndeprived of its constitutional prerogatives, and by involving in the \r\ndemocratic process all national political leaders to rally consensus around \r\nthe values underpinning our democratic renewal. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n88 \r\n(Mr. Natchaba. Togo) \r\nThese bodies have sufficient power to lead the country to this \r\nirreversible democratic peace process, but they do not have enough power to \r\nblock our march to democracy. Accordingly we can only express satisfaction \r\nthat the two senior officials of the executive branch, the President and the \r\nPrime Minister, have solemnly proclaimed their determination to continue to \r\nits end the democratic process that is under way and to devote all their \r\nenergy to organizing referenda set by the electoral timetable. It is at this \r\nstage in our apprenticeship of democracy that the new Government of National \r\nUnion of Transition, formed by the Prime Minister together with the Head of \r\nState and after consultations with the large political families, was approved \r\non 14 September by a majority of 60 per cent by the High Council of the \r\nRepublic and following a secret ballot. \r\nVery revealing indeed of the resolve of the people of Togo to overcome \r\nits contradictions in order to promote democratic renewal, this vote of \r\napproval, cast in a particularly difficult context, sufficiently demonstrates \r\n\"that in Togo, whatever might be said, we can still say no in full freedom and \r\nwithout any fear of a proposal from the executive power\". \r\nWe take this opportunity to inform this Assembly that the draft \r\nconstitution of the Fourth Republic, submitted to referendum on Sunday \r\n27 September 1992, was adopted by 99.09 per cent. The referendum met with \r\ngreat enthusiasm and almost unanimous support, with a participation rate of \r\nnearly 75 per cent. The Government will not fail to learn the lesson from \r\nthis first vote to correct the mistakes revealed in the first referendum. \r\nThis is a guarantee for the acceptance of ballot results by all parties. \r\nIt is appropriate to reiterate to our friendly countries and to the \r\nUnited Nations, as well as to the entire international community, the profound \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n89-90 \r\n(Mr. Natchaba. Tngr.) \r\ngratitude of the Government and the people of Togo for the invaluable support \r\nthey have given to our democratic process. We sincerely hope that this \r\nassistance will be continued throughout the coming elections. \r\nIt is undeniable that the struggle to establish a State of law in Togo is \r\na job that falls essentially to the people of Togo themselves, and that they \r\nbear the primary responsibility for fashioning their democracy, according to \r\nthe means they have and in keeping with their culture and their national \r\nspirit. With courage and determination, we will strive to meet the challenge \r\nin union and mutual acceptance. \r\nIn keeping with the conclusions of the work of the joint commission, the \r\nGovernment has set up a security plan the results of which can already be seen \r\nin the field. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n91 \r\n(Mr. Natchaba. Togo) \r\nThanks to this consensus, political violence, which until recently was \r\nrampant in my country, is now being stemmed throughout Togo. All political \r\nparties will have access, without restriction and with complete security, to \r\nall parts of Togo during their political campaigns. \r\nManagement by consensus in this short period of our political life is \r\nwithout any doubt the driving force behind political detente in Togo and a \r\nguarantee of the reliability and transparency of the coming elections. \r\nFinally, the major protagonists of our political life have agreed to the \r\nprinciple of mutual guarantees, whose importance is clear to all. We must \r\nimplement all the measures that we have decided on before, during and after \r\nthe elections. Our country, determined to restore peace and tranquillity, \r\nassures the Assembly that the democratic process under way is irreversible. \r\nDespite our hope that we can live from now on in an international society \r\nwithout conflict, the world continues to witness a growth of armed conflict. \r\nIt is no longer merely Africa and Asia that contain pockets of tension. \r\nEurope, with war raging in the former Yugoslavia more precisely, in Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina is now affected. That tragedy challenges the international \r\ncommunity to do all it can to ensure respect for man and human dignity. We \r\nunreservedly support all the European initiatives and salute the laudable \r\nefforts of the United Nations to restore peace to that part of Europe. \r\nElsewhere in the world, in Africa for some years now Somalia and Liberia \r\nhave been two more hotbeds of tension where fratricidal war rages, already \r\nclaiming thousands of victims. Death, desolation, poverty and hunger are the \r\ndaily lot of these peoples. \r\nFrom this United Nations rostrum we call upon our Somali and Liberian \r\nbrothers to demonstrate positive nationalism and constructive patriotism to \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n92 \r\n(Mr. Natchaba. Togo) \r\nhelp implement the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity \r\n(OAU) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to contribute \r\nto restoring peace to their respective countries. \r\nThe South African Government must understand that the wheels of history \r\nare still turning and that it is now clear that structures imposed by force \r\ncannot survive the determination of the people to live in peace. The \r\ncontinued plight of that part of our continent demands that the General \r\nAssembly intensify its efforts for victory in the fight to eradicate \r\napartheid. This requires that all forms of pressure be maintained to compel \r\nthe De Klerk Government to commit itself fully to the political and \r\ninstitutional reforms that it has already courageously undertaken. \r\nTogo is following with particular interest the developing situation in \r\nthe Middle East. It reiterates its full support for the peace process started \r\nin October 1991 in Madrid, and calls upon the parties to demonstrate greater \r\nwisdom, courage and restraint in order to strengthen that process and bring \r\nabout a final solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. It should be based on a \r\nnegotiated agreement acceptable to all, guaranteeing the security of all the \r\nStates of the region, including Israel, within secure, internationally \r\nrecognized borders, and allowing the Palestinian people freely and fully to \r\nexercise their right to self-determination. \r\nWith regard to the Arab-Persian Gulf, where peace still seems to be \r\nthreatened, my country reiterates its appeal to all the States of the region \r\nscrupulously to abide by the various relevant resolutions of the Security \r\nCouncil, and to make every effort to avoid the risk of new confrontations \r\nwhich still hovers over that part of the world.* \r\n* Mr. Holo (Benin), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n93 \r\n(Mr. Natchaba. Togo) \r\nIn Asia, Togo appreciates the Secretary-General\u0027s efforts to deploy the \r\nUnited Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). We hope that the \r\nnational reconciliation effort now going on will gain further ground. \r\nBecause of the great suffering they inflict on peoples, the conflicts to \r\nwhich I have referred render sterile any notion of sovereignty and \r\nindependence. Is it not better, then, to prevent armed conflicts rather than \r\nseek to resolve them? \r\nEfforts made throughout the world by regional and international \r\norganizations in the search for new machinery to prevent war and maintain \r\npeace are likely to promote social progress and to establish better living \r\nconditions for our peoples. Accordingly, my delegation welcomes the fact that \r\nthe Security Council on 31 January 1992 held a Summit meeting which considered \r\nways of strengthening and making more efficient the United Nations capacity \r\nfor preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping. Togo very much \r\nappreciates the conclusions of that meeting and the report (A/47/277) \r\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General at the Council\u0027s request. \r\nIn dealing with the many conflicts raging throughout the world, \r\npreventive diplomacy would allow, with real determination by the protagonists \r\nof international life, particularly the parties to a conflict, the speedy \r\nattainment of its goal of peace. \r\nThe world is now witnessing the end of East-West antagonism, but the much \r\nfeared danger of a world war has not yet been overcome. Arsenals of highly \r\nsophisticated weapons still exist throughout the world, posing serious threats \r\nto international peace and security. There is an urgent need to destroy \r\nweapons of mass destruction and halt the arms race; the military Powers should \r\ndevote themselves to that task in order to curb any reflex action to have \r\nrecourse to war. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n94-95 \r\n(Mr. Natchaba. Togo) \r\nThe Non-Proliferation Treaty has been renewed without time-limit and the \r\nStrategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and the Treaty on Conventional Armed \r\nForces in Europe (CFE) have entered into force. The final text of the \r\nconvention banning chemical weapons will be submitted for our consideration \r\nthis session. All these developments increase the international community\u0027s \r\nhope that the military Powers will embark on general and complete disarmament. \r\nFurthermore, with the end of the cold war, and with distrust now giving \r\nway to trust and cooperation, the delegation of Togo believes that it is time \r\nfor the international community to envisage drafting, without delay, a \r\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty, after which the United Nations would play a \r\nleading role as the main body where consensus can be forged on security and \r\ndisarmament problems. \r\nWe welcome the recent initiative of President Francois Mitterrand in \r\nunilaterally decreeing a one-year moratorium on nuclear tests by his country. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n96 \r\n(Mr. Natchaba. Togo) \r\nWe also welcome the statement made on 2 July 1992 by \r\nPresident George Bush on repatriating certain tactical nuclear weapons of the \r\nUnited States with a view to destroying them. \r\nAs we see it, recent events and initiatives, as well as many positive \r\nworld developments in the disarmament field, are encouraging. However, the \r\nproliferation and international transfer of conventional weapons, particularly \r\nin Africa, are a source of major concern on the part of the authorities of \r\nTogo. In this respect, we believe that a United Nations regional centre for \r\npeace and disarmament, like the one in Lome, is still useful and we should \r\nseek to increase its role, its powers and the scope of its activities. The \r\nUnited Nations should give the regional centres greater means so that they \r\ncould fully participate in the strengthening of security and peace. \r\nSerious problems such as the ones connected with the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security persist, and this absolutely dictates the \r\nexploration of new approaches that could lead to a strengthening of the \r\nability of the United Nations to act. While the East-West confrontation \r\nparalysed the Organization as it tried to carry out its noble mission, the \r\ncurrent detente seems to offer greater opportunities now to Member States to \r\nreaffirm their commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter. For \r\nits part our country reiterates its faith in the United Nations and adheres to \r\nthe mechanisms for establishing preventive diplomacy and restoring and \r\nmaintaining peace. However, the efficient functioning of the United Nations \r\npresupposes restructuring its organs and adapting them to contemporary facts. \r\nThe promotion of democracy and human rights means today that the fate of \r\nmankind as a whole in the special and delicate field of the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security should not be left to the discretion of only \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n97 \r\n(Mr. Natchaba. Togo) \r\na few States. The management of peace and security reguires the concerted \r\naction of States as a whole, whatever their geographical size or their \r\neconomic, financial or military power. Consequently, Togo unreservedly \r\nsupports any proposal to revise the composition of the Security Council. If \r\nthat were done, the democratic revolution going on in States will finally have \r\nreached international organizations. \r\nPeace and democracy presuppose the existence of a viable economy capable \r\nof meeting the vital needs of food, health, training and housing. The \r\nprogress that needs to be made for man\u0027s full development is essential for \r\ndemocracy and its consolidation. It is a basic truth that there can be no \r\ndevelopment without democracy, just as one cannot conceive of democracy \r\nwithout development or peace. \r\nIn order to safeguard peace in the world we must commit ourselves fully \r\nto the idea of a fairer division of the riches of the Earth. But we must \r\nnote, with regret, that the international situation has not changed in this \r\nrespect. \r\nAt the end of this century an analysis of the international economic \r\nsituation points up many social inequalities between nations. The hopes we \r\nhad at the end of the cold war should find their justification in a \r\npartnership between rich countries and developing countries so that the \r\nappetites of some do not cause starvation in others. Unfortunately, we look \r\non, powerless, as the gap between rich and poor grows ever wider. \r\nThe economies of the developing countries are in a state of chronic \r\nrecession, the most serious in several decades. Growth has slowed, \r\nparticularly in Africa, where the crisis has fundamentally affected all \r\naspects of life, and a real deterioration of living conditions has resulted in \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n98 \r\n(Mr. Natchaba. Togo) \r\nthese countries. It is clear that this situation will continue unless efforts \r\nare made to establish a new world economic order based on fairness and a more \r\ngenerous humanistic vision of international cooperation. In this respect, we \r\nvery much appreciate the decision taken by Japan to make available to Africa \r\nan aid package of $700 million spread out over the next three years. This \r\naction, and other measures too, although encouraging are far from meeting the \r\nreal concerns of the developing countries, in particular the least developed \r\nof them. \r\nIndeed, if these countries are to break out of the profound crisis, \r\nurgent and appropriate action must be taken by the international community to \r\nguarantee remunerative prices for commodities and to dismantle tariff \r\nbarriers, which are obstacles to the exports of these countries. It is vital \r\nthat the international community mobilize larger resources to relaunch \r\ninvestment and that it find a lasting solution to the debt problem. \r\nAppropriate mechanisms must be found to make it possible to reimburse and \r\ngenerate resources to ensure economic recovery. \r\nThe economic crises of our countries have social consequences that \r\nparticularly affect young people. Juvenile delinquency, illicit \r\ndrug-trafficking, drug abuse and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome \r\n(AIDS) are serious threats for mankind. Constant attention should be focused \r\non them. \r\nSustainable and lasting economic and social development is impossible \r\nunless there is a healthy environment. Fortunately, today the international \r\ncommunity has mobilized to solve the problems caused by the deterioration of \r\nthe Earth and of nature. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n99-100 \r\n(Mr. Natchaba. Togo) \r\nWe are living in a new era today. This new era should be based on \r\nfreedom, understanding, and love of one\u0027s neighbour and of peace. \r\nGuaranteeing peace and security, working for freedom and democracy, ensuring \r\nworld prosperity through free international trade, preserving a healthy \r\nenvironment and creating stable international relations based on dialogue and \r\ncooperation: all these, among others, are challenges that should be met by \r\nthe United Nations in order to establish the new world order that we all \r\nsincerely wish to see. Therefore we must give of our very best to attain \r\nthese goals. \r\nWe hope that the twenty-first century will give us a world in which man, \r\nfreed from the plight of poverty, oppression, tyranny and destitution, can use \r\nall his faculties and give free rein to his creativity in order to achieve his \r\nown full development and the social and economic development of the State as \r\nthe guarantor of peace and security. \r\nA/47 /PV. 17 \r\n101 \r\nMr. MENENDEZ PARK (Guatemala) (interpretation from Spanish): Allow \r\nme, Sir, to congratulate Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-seventh session and to assure him that he will \r\nhave the full cooperation of my delegation in the discharge of his important \r\ntask. \r\nI should like also to congratulate Mr. Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia on \r\nthe efficient manner in which he discharged his duties as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-sixth session. \r\nI extend fraternal and cordial greetings to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, \r\nwho, as Secretary-General, has headed the Organization since the beginning of \r\nthe year. We realize that during this initial stage he has had a difficult \r\ntask. He has undertaken the job of restructuring and reforming the system to \r\nadapt the Organization to the new international context. \r\nIn this joint effort, in which mankind has placed its highest hopes for a \r\nbetter and more just future, it is positive and comforting to have new friends \r\nin our midst. In that spirit, I extend the warmest welcome to the nations \r\nthat joined the Organization this year. Guatemala offers them its friendship, \r\nrespect, solidarity and cooperation. \r\nThe nations of the world are gathered in this forum with mixed feelings \r\nof uncertainty and hope uncertainty because, following the dramatic changes \r\nin the international order, we find ourselves on the eve of a new era, whose \r\nfundamental features have yet to be defined; hope because, despite a history \r\nof sterile confrontations, an opportunity is opening up for a just and \r\nequitable international order in which cooperation between nations would be \r\ngeared to the solution of the fundamental problems of the international \r\ncommunity: extreme poverty, sustainable development, peace, security and the \r\nenvironment. \r\nA/47/PV. 17 \r\n102 \r\n(Mr. Menendez Park. Guatemala) \r\nWe Guatemalans view these changes with great hope, and we fully \r\nunderstand their historic implications, as our country too is involved in a \r\nfar-reaching and ambitious process of transformation, which we trust will \r\npositively change the course of our history. Guatemala is making great \r\nefforts to overcome the confrontation that, for years, has riven our society \r\nand afflicted thousands of Guatemalan families. \r\nOthers took advantage of the problems of our political and economic \r\ndevelopment to transplant their hostilities to our soil. Therefore, for more \r\nthan 30 years our country was involved in foreign and alien confrontation that \r\nleft only suffering in its wake and led to neglect of the central problems of \r\nour society. \r\nAs a small country, Guatemala suffered from the ups and downs of an \r\ninternational system based on ideological confrontation. As was the case on a \r\nworld-wide scale, economic resources necessary to give impetus to the process \r\nof our people\u0027s socio-economic well-being were earmarked to finance a sterile \r\nand cruel confrontation. The attention of the various sectors of our society \r\nwas distracted from genuine questions of development and obfuscated by an \r\nideological polemic whose outcome was violence and stagnation. Problems of \r\nhunger, education, social well-being, health and poverty are among those that \r\nwere left unattended and unsolved throughout these irretrievably lost \r\ndecades. \r\nThe whole Central American region found itself in a similar situation \r\nso much so that it became the focus of international attention as a result of \r\ninternal armed clashes and military tensions. As a region, however, we have \r\nbeen able to take our historic destiny in hand and, by an approach that we \r\nourselves designed, often in the face of the scepticism of people who thought \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n103-105 \r\n(Mr. Menendez Park. Guatemala) \r\nus unable to solve our problems other than on the basis of external formulas, \r\nhave managed to overcome the spiral of violence and, at the same time, \r\ninitiate a process of democratization and pacification, which is now bearing \r\nfruit and is transforming our nations with the promise of a better future for \r\nour peoples. \r\nAs Central Americans, we Guatemalans are aware that the challenge of our \r\nfuture is entirely in our own hands. The process of democratization, begun \r\nsome years ago, is the start of a much broader process one aimed at \r\ntransforming our social, economic and cultural structures and at securing the \r\nwell-being of all Guatemalans. The effort that is needed to generate a \r\nprocess of overall improvement in the standards of living of our people \r\nrequires that the funds used for armed confrontation be reallocated for social \r\ninvestment. \r\nPresident Serrano Elias Lanzo, at the beginning of his administration in \r\n1991, launched a peace plan for the whole nation, conscious of the fact that \r\nprogress towards democratization of the country is the only means of achieving \r\neven higher goals. Under this plan, peace is conceived of as a source of the \r\nbasic conditions that will allow for the harmonious development of the \r\nindividual in society and for peaceful and respectful coexistence between \r\npeople, rather than simply as the absence of violence or the ending of \r\ninternal armed confrontation. \r\nIn this framework, the Government of the Republic has begun a dialogue \r\nwith the URNG with the air.i of securing an end to the internal conflict and of \r\ninvolving the groups taking part in it so that, within the constitutional \r\nframework of the State\u0027s laws, they will renounce the use of arms and \r\nparticipate in the political life of the country in a constructive rather than \r\na destructive manner. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n106 \r\n(Mr. Menendez Park. Guatemala) \r\nUnfortunately, the pace of the initial talks was slowed by unconstructive \r\nattitudes on the part of the representatives of the insurgents, attitudes that \r\ncan be understood only as an attempt artificially to delay the peace process \r\nand thus to gain special benefits not justified by the realities on the \r\nground. The Government\u0027s goodwill has been shown by its acceptance of an \r\nagreement on human rights proposed by the conciliator who presides over the \r\nNational Commission for the Reconciliation of Guatemala. The insurgents have \r\nnot accepted this proposal. \r\nThe Government of Guatemala deplores and rejects this delaying approach \r\nwhich results in unnecessary prolongation of the sufferings of Guatemalans and \r\nlimits the possibilities of action by the Government to deal with the real \r\nproblems of the people who elected it. We appeal to the international \r\ncommunity to condemn these delaying tactics, support the continuation of \r\nnegotiations and appeal to the insurgents to adopt a positive and realistic \r\nattitude. \r\nThe Government of the Republic trusts that in the next meetings with the \r\nmediation of the Conciliator and the participation of the Personal \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, these obstacles \r\nwill be overcome and the talks will continue in order soon to reach the \r\ncomplete peace for which all Guatemalans yearn. \r\nThe transformation of Guatemalan society, however, goes well beyond \r\nputting an end to internal armed confrontation. For this reason my Government \r\nhas developed important initiatives aimed at substantively modifying some of \r\nthe structures of our society. Central to these efforts is the decision to \r\nput on a solid footing a State where the rule of law is paramount, \r\nguaranteeing the effective administration of justice for all citizens, without \r\ndiscrimination. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n107 \r\n(Mr. Menendez Park. Guatemala) \r\nA renewed and revitalized State under the rule of law, guaranteeing fully \r\neffective human rights, is the central aim of the Administration of \r\nPresident Serrano Elias. In that context, important achievements have been \r\nmade, perhaps the most important being the restoration, through a struggle \r\nagainst impunity, of the individual\u0027s trust in democratic institutions. \r\nThe Government is aware that much remains to be done in order to ensure \r\nfully effective human rights, but we believe that it must be recognized that \r\nover the past two years important advances have been made in this respect. \r\nAt the same time, significant efforts are being made to create conditions \r\nthat will permit the return to their homeland of refugees who have gone to \r\nother countries, fleeing the violence that affected their population groups in \r\nthe past. The National Peace Fund (FONAPAZ) and the National Land Fund \r\n(FONATIERRA), both created by the present Government, are participating \r\njointly with the Special Commission for Refugees, Returnees and Displaced \r\nPersons (CEAR) in creating conditions appropriate not only for the return of \r\nrefugees but also for the effective reintegration of returnees and displaced \r\npersons into society, providing them with conditions to engage in productive \r\nactivity that will allow for their social and human development. \r\nI have taken the liberty of drawing attention to some of the important \r\naspects of my country\u0027s internal politics in order to give the background to \r\nthe points that I shall now make concerning the international scene and our \r\nforeign policy. \r\nGuatemala has followed with close attention the important world \r\ndevelopments of recent years. We are certainly witnessing the formation of a \r\nnew international order, which springs from the ashes of a confrontational and \r\nbipolar world. We should take advantage of the new international environment \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n108-110 \r\n(Mr. Menendez Park, Guatemala) \r\nto seek peaceful solutions to conflicts and confrontations that still persist, \r\nand thus allow the Governments concerned to apply to development and peace \r\nresources formerly earmarked for financing those confrontations. \r\nAt the same time the dividends of world peace should be channelled to \r\ninvestment for the social well-being of peoples. Nuclear disarmament, a major \r\ngoal in itself, should also be used to generate a surplus with which to \r\nfinance programmes to resolve the most serious world problems hunger, \r\ndisease, illiteracy and poverty. The new climate of confidence among nations \r\nand new patterns of global security should be based not only on an absence of \r\nimmediate military threats, but on real efforts to resolve the central \r\nproblems of mankind. \r\nMore than ever before, we have a historic opportunity today to make \r\nsignificant advances towards the creation of a truly just world order, based \r\non cooperation, not domination. To achieve this, however, we need above all \r\nto recognize the errors affecting the international system and to establish \r\nnew rules permitting truly harmonious coexistence. \r\nIt is necessary to carry out promptly an exhaustive, in-depth revision of \r\nrelations between the developed and the developing nations. There are \r\nenormous imbalances which if present trends continue will lead to a deepening \r\ngap between the two. \r\nThe industrialized countries and the developing countries must jointly \r\nagree on an agenda of matters that should be given priority attention by the \r\ninternational community and discuss and explore machinery and methods that \r\nwill allow us better to face the challenge of development in all its aspects. \r\nThe World Summit for Social Development gives us the opportunity to discuss \r\nthese problems at the highest level. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n111 \r\n(Mr. Menendez Park. Guatemala) \r\nMultilateralism has taken on a renewed and vigorous impetus in the task \r\nof building a new world order. The importance of multilateral forums as \r\ncentres of discussion, analysis and the adoption of generalized policies for \r\nthe international system is a significant opportunity for developing nations \r\nto participate actively in the process of constituting the new rules of the \r\ninternational system. \r\nThe experience gained in organizing approaches that allowed us to \r\nformulate proposals and present our interests to the industrialized nations, \r\nat a time when ideological confrontation relegated our countries\u0027 fundamental \r\nproblems to the background, should be used to advantage today to ensure that \r\nthe international agenda suitably reflects our interests and needs. \r\nHowever, those interests and perspectives will be reflected in \r\ninternational forums only to the degree that we fight for it. To that end, \r\nSouth-South cooperation is a fundamental vehicle and the efforts to achieve \r\ncoordination between developing nations should be stepped up. \r\nIn Guatemala\u0027s view, the world order that emerges from the \r\ntransformations under way should be built upon deep respect for the norms and \r\nprinciples of international law. The possibility of harmonious, stable \r\ncoexistence between the nations of the world depends on unconditional respect \r\nfor States\u0027 sovereignty, independence and equality before the law. Therefore, \r\nthe international community must reject any State\u0027s attempt to extend the \r\napplication of its own law5 beyond its own borders. \r\nWithin the context of the emerging world order, encouraging efforts are \r\nnow under way to reach a peaceful settlement of the Middle East conflict. \r\nThose encouraging deeds are in contrast to the tragic events taking place in \r\nthe former Yugoslavia and the equally tragic situation prevailing in Somalia. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n112 \r\n(Mr. Menendez Park. Guatemala) \r\nThe international community must renew its efforts to find peaceful, \r\nnegotiated solutions in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nMy country has viewed with great interest the measures taken by the \r\nSecretary-General to adapt the United Nations for the better fulfilment of its \r\nfunctions, and we support all efforts that enable the Organization to attain \r\nthe objectives of the Charter. \r\nIn particular, I wish to emphasize the active role the Organization has \r\ntaken in peace-keeping in various regions of the world. In the resolution of \r\nconflicts that originated before the end of the cold war and in cases of new \r\ntensions emerging from the geopolitical processes resulting from that historic \r\ndevelopment, the peace-keeping forces under the flag of the United Nations \r\ncarry out a fundamental role by opening the way to truce, dialogue and \r\nnegotiation, thus preventing the prolongation of confrontations that can be \r\nsatisfactorily resolved by peaceful means. \r\nWe should, however, re-examine the criteria used in financing those \r\nforces. The cost of peace-keeping operations could prove overwhelming for \r\nboth the Organization and its Member States, especially those, like Guatemala, \r\nthat have limited resources. In this regard, we welcome the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report \"An Agenda for Peace\" as a contribution to those \r\nefforts. \r\nAlong the same lines, there is no doubt about the need to reform \r\nstructures that emerged and functioned within the framework of a \r\nconfrontational order. Such reform should not be limited, however, to the \r\nmere streamlining of the bureaucracy, but should aspire to the creation of a \r\nsystem that ensures satisfactory representation for all its members. As part \r\nof those efforts, we should deal without delay with the composition of the \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n113 \r\n(Mr. Menendez Park. Guatemala) \r\nSecurity Council of the Organization. The current structure and procedures of \r\nthe Council are the result of a political order that we have left far behind, \r\nand we need to revise them, adapt them to the current situation and prevent \r\nthe creation of patterns of political tutelage that go against the principles \r\nof equitable participation and juridical equality among States. \r\nIn fact, a new problem is beginning to take shape within the structure of \r\nthe Organization, and it is nothing more or less than the reflection of a \r\nglobal issue: the privileged position enjoyed by some nations encourages \r\nmonopolistic structures in various multilateral forums. \r\nThe United Nations will be an effective and efficient forum to the extent \r\nthat each and every one of its Members can feel that its interests are \r\nadequately represented in the policies and programmes of the various \r\ndepartments of the Organization. Attitudes of political and economic tutelage \r\nwill be very unlikely to strengthen it; nor will they facilitate the \r\nestablishment of international patterns of cooperation. \r\nWe believe that in the protection and promotion of human rights we have a \r\nclear example of such a situation. At this time Guatemala has the advisory \r\nservices of an expert adviser from the United Nations, who has received a \r\nbroad mandate from the Commission on Human Rights to assist my country in its \r\nefforts to achieve the full realization of human rights. The mandate has been \r\naccepted by my Government in the spirit of openness and cooperation that it \r\nhas maintained in dealing with the Commission. \r\nIn addition, my country also unreservedly supports the United Nations \r\nobjective of promoting those rights internationally and will continue to \r\ncooperate with all its organs in that task. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n114-115 \r\n(Mr. Menendez Park. Guatemala) \r\nAt the same time, we feel we must express our concern at what we see as \r\nthe application of apparently selective criteria by some members of the \r\nCommission on Human Rights in its work. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n116 \r\n(Mr. Menendez Park. Guatemala) \r\nNevertheless, disturbing phenomena such as xenophobia, racism, \r\ndiscrimination against migrant workers and ethnic and religious \r\ndiscrimination, which have become more acute in recent years in certain \r\nnations as a result of the changing international system, have not been given \r\nsufficient attention by the Committee during its recent deliberations. \r\nFrom the work of the Commission on Human Rights and the Subcommission on \r\nPrevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, it would appear \r\nthat it is only in some developing countries that one finds obstacles to the \r\nfull application of human rights, disregarding the serious problems that exist \r\nin other nations. In both of these forums, it would appear that the \r\ncredibility of democratic, freely elected Governments is being questioned, \r\ngiving greater validity to the arguments presented by politically compromised \r\norganizations that favor sectarian movements which seek, through the use of \r\nforce and by causing suffering to peoples, to alter lawful democratic \r\ninstitutions. \r\nIt is urgent and necessary that the Committee dealing with \r\nNon-Governmental Organizations engage in a review of the non-governmental \r\norganizations that cooperate in the work of the Economic and Social Council \r\n(ECOSOC) and that participate in particular in the work of the Commission on \r\nHuman Rights, in order to ensure that their participation is positive and does \r\nnot answer to sectarian political interests that might tend to discredit them. \r\nAt the same time, it is necessary to review the working procedures of \r\nboth forums so that organizations that participate as observers will not \r\nreceive preferential treatment over that of members of the Organization who \r\nare not on the Committee. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n117 \r\n(Mr. Menendez Park. Guatemala) \r\nThe Government of Guatemala will continue to cooperate with the United \r\nNations in the field of huwan rights, and we hope in this respect to continue \r\nto receive the advisory services that enable the Government to fulfil the \r\ncommitment of President Serrano Elias to promote the full enjoyment of human \r\nrights in our country. However, I appeal to the relevant organizations to \r\nguard against abuse of this spirit of openness and cooperation by groups \r\nseeking the destabilization of the State, an unjust and selective situation \r\nthat would ultimately oblige the Government to review, analyse and reformulate \r\nits position on these matters. \r\nThe World Conference on Human Rights, to be held next year, should \r\nprovide an opportunity to examine the present situation and to plan the \r\nOrganization\u0027s future policies in a matter that is of pivotal importance to \r\nthe well-being of humankind. \r\nWe are in the process of analysing, proposing and establishing a new \r\nworld order based on cooperation and coexistence. The new role that falls to \r\nthe United Nations implies growing functions of coordination and discussion \r\nbetween nations. To that end, the principle of universality should prevail \r\nover other interests. \r\nIn this context, the Republic of China (Taiwan), one of the largest \r\neconomies in the world, is in a position to contribute significantly to \r\nseeking solutions to problems that nations of the world must face. Its \r\npresence in the United Nations would strengthen our Organization and permit \r\nmore appropriate treatment of topics with global implications, such as that of \r\nthe environment. Consequently, Guatemala appeals for consideration of the \r\nneed for participation by the Republic of China (Taiwan) as a Member of our \r\nOrganization, in addition to the People\u0027s Republic of China. We believe, \r\nA/47/PV. 17 \r\n118 \r\n(Mr. Menendez Park. Guatemala) \r\nmoreover, that this attitude would make a suitable contribution to the spirit \r\nof cooperation and conciliation that should characterize the new world order. \r\nThe structural reform undertaken by my Government includes a strategy for \r\neconomic openness designed to bring our economy into the flow of international \r\ncommerce. \r\nIn addition to the effort at integration in the Central American region, \r\nwhich we support with deep conviction and whose aim is to shape a community of \r\nnations in the Central American isthmus, Guatemala at this time is also \r\nnegotiating its participation in various regional economic-integration \r\nprogrammes. \r\nThis strategy is in line with our conviction that more active and open \r\nparticipation in the international market is a central element in achieving \r\neconomic growth and development for our population. We have signed the \r\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in the belief that eliminating barriers \r\nto international trade creates better opportunities for our economies. \r\nHowever, we are concerned by the fact that the liberalizing theories \r\noriginating in the industrialized nations are giving way to clearly \r\nprotectionist attitudes precisely at a time when our products are becoming \r\ncompetitive in their markets. Rules and regulations are emerging as an excuse \r\nto prevent the inflow of commodities and manufactured products, upon which our \r\ncountries\u0027 economies largely depend. \r\nThese attitudes can hardly provide a stimulus to trust and understanding, \r\nand they also give rise to questions about the sincerity of principles that \r\nare publicly proclaimed but only partially practised. However, we should not \r\nbe thought of as ingenuous. We are aware of the fact that every country will \r\npromote its particular interests to the extent allowed by other nations. We \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n119-120 \r\n(Mr. Menendez Park. Guatemala) \r\nare convinced, however, that for the sake of higher and more long-term \r\ninterests, nations must set aside some of their more immediate and narrow \r\ninterests. That concession should be general and reciprocal, however; \r\notherwise dialogue becomes but a theoretical and sterile exercise. \r\nThe activity of our Organization and the contribution that Member States \r\nmake to its work are aimed at improving the quality of life and promoting the \r\noverall development of human beings. That makes it imperative that we \r\nstrengthen the mechanisms of cooperation among nations. \r\nv. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n121 \r\n(Mr. Menendez Park. Guatemala) \r\nThis session of the General Assembly is being held on the eve of a new \r\nera in international relations, whose principal features are yet to be \r\ndefined. I express the hope that we, the participants in the Assembly, will \r\nprove equal to the challenge posed by the future peaceful coexistence and \r\nwell-being for all mankind. \r\nMr. SEY (Gambia): The forty-seventh session of the General Assembly \r\nis being held at a particularly crucial moment, when our Organization will be \r\ncalled upon to demonstrate innovative thinking and flexibility in the face of \r\nthe emerging challenges. \r\nAgainst the background of the very important agenda that is before us, \r\nlet me congratulate Mr. Ganev on his unanimous election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-seventh session. I am confident that his \r\nprofessional competence and dynamism make him uniquely qualified to preside \r\nover the Assembly. I wish to assure him of my delegation\u0027s full support in \r\ncarrying out his formidable task to a successful completion. \r\nLet me also extend our heartfelt appreciation to his predecessor. \r\nAmbassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, for the exemplary manner in which he \r\nconducted the deliberations of the forty-sixth session. \r\nPermit me, on behalf of the Government of the Gambia and on my own \r\nbehalf, to express our heartfelt congratulations to the new Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whom I have had the honour and privilege of knowing \r\nfor many years. As a distinguished scholar, an outstanding diplomat and a \r\nperson of exceptional character, Mr. Boutros Boutro-Ghali has in him those \r\nvery fine qualities of leadership that our Organization needs at this very \r\ncrucial period of its hist \u003ery. We in Africa are indeed honoured to have one \r\nof our illustrious sons se-ve in this highly prestigious and important \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n122 \r\n(Mr. Sey. Gambia) \r\nposition. I am confident, and I am sure I am speaking for Africa and for all \r\nthose who know Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, that he will live up to the very \r\nhigh expectations we all have of him. His long and distinguished career in \r\nthe service of his country gives us reason for this trust. \r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to \r\nhis worthy predecessor, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, who during his tenure of \r\noffice contributed greatly to the strengthening of the United Nations, \r\nallowing it to assume a lead role in promoting world peace and security. His \r\nindefatigable efforts in pursuit of an atmosphere of understanding for the \r\nsolution of problems in different parts of the world are exemplary and deserve \r\nour very deep appreciation. I wish him a happy retirement. \r\nThe Gambia notes with great pleasure the admission of the Republics of \r\nBelarus, San Marino, Croatia, Slovenia, Uzbekistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nKyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan as new Members of the United Nations. I should \r\nlike to welcome them and congratulate them on their accession to full \r\nmembership of the United Nations. As they take their place in this comity of \r\nnations, it behoves each of us to extend to them the hand of friendship and \r\nsupport that characterizes this great Organization. \r\nAs we reflect on the activities of our Organization during the past \r\n12 months, we are encouraged by the numerous actions and decisions that have \r\nbeen taken in support of world peace and progress. Certainly, problems \r\ncontinue to exist, and in some cases have increased in intensity and \r\ncomplexity, but the full commitment of our Organization to resolving them \r\nremains ever strong. \r\nOther less conflictual but none the less important issues of concern to \r\nhumanity have also received attention. I would like, in this respect, to \r\nrefer to the historic Earth Summit, convened in Rio de Janeiro in June this \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n123 \r\n(Mr. Sey. Gambia) \r\nyear. This meeting, which brought together leaders from all over the world, \r\nmarks the first major step taken by humanity to reflect upon and map out a \r\nstrategy for the survival of all species on Earth. It marks the beginning of \r\na more responsible attitude to the Earth and its resources. The Rio \r\nDeclaration, the Agenda 21 programmes and the Conventions on climate change \r\nand bio-diversity all combine to lay the basis for a sustainable development. \r\nWe fully support the recommendations of the Conference and do hope that \r\nthe various programmes of Agenda 21 will receive adequate support and \r\nfinancing to ensure their successful implementation. Of special interest to \r\nour countries is the recommendation to set up an intergovernmental negotiating \r\ncommittee to negotiate a convention on drought and desertification. We \r\nstrongly urge the Assembly at this session to take the appropriate measures to \r\nallow the committee to commence its work as soon as possible. \r\nThis century has witnessed two world wars, which brought untold hardship \r\nand suffering to mankind. The creation of the United Nations immediately \r\nafter the Second World War reflected the determination of the founding fathers \r\nto spare future generations the scourge of war. We all know the story of what \r\nfollowed. The cold war, with its debilitating effects on the capacity of the \r\nUnited Nations, as well as the consequences of the destructive conflicts it \r\nengendered, demonstrated the extent to which our dreams and hopes became a \r\nnightmare. Today, mankind has been given an opportunity again to develop and \r\nanchor peace and stability in this world. The current entente in the \r\ninternational scene and the positive disposition of all nations vis-a-vis the \r\nUnited Nations provide a valuable opportunity for our Organization to assume a \r\nmore forceful role in purs lit of world peace and stability. For it is only in \r\npeace and stability that human development can progress satisfactorily. We \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n124-125 \r\n(Mr. Sey. Gamhia) \r\nare very much encouraged by the important role the United Nations has recently \r\nassumed, and would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the \r\nSecretary-General for convening the Security Council summit meeting, which \r\nsought, among other things to promote greater understanding and cooperation \r\nin the world. We are in full support of the new approach to conflict \r\nresolution referred to as preventive diplomacy. \r\nPeace and security in the world will remain elusive as long as we \r\ncontinue to have centres of armed conflict that risk degenerating into \r\nregional conflicts that threaten world peace and stability. The situation in \r\nSomalia, the former Yugoslavia and other trouble spots around the world \r\nconstitute an important threat to world peace and stability. We will need the \r\ncollective resources and determination of the United Nations and all its \r\nMember States to resolve these conflicts. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n126 \r\n(Mr. Sey. Gambia) \r\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina has deteriorated very seriously. \r\nThe summary execution of civilian members of the non-Serbian population and \r\nthe internment in concentration camps of thousands of people testify to gross \r\nhuman-rights abuses. The Gambia joins other nations in strongly condemning \r\nthe perpetrators of these acts. We also condemn in no uncertain terms the \r\nconcept of \"ethnic cleansing\", which in every respect is reminiscent of Nazi \r\npractices. It is totally unacceptable in this day and age to torture, kill or \r\nsend into exile innocent men, women and children because of their religious \r\nbeliefs. We will all be guilty if we stand by and see these atrocities being \r\nperpetrated with impunity. \r\nWe fully appreciate and commend the bold efforts of the United Nations \r\nand the European Community in their search for peace in the former \r\nYugoslavia. We salute the courage of all those taking part in humanitarian \r\nrelief missions, particularly the soldiers who risk their lives to ensure that \r\nfood and other relief items reach Bosnia and Herzegovina. We strongly believe \r\nthat unless the fundamental cause of the conflict is addressed, the tragedy \r\nwill continue. Serbian aggression against Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\nmust be stopped. \r\nWe join the international community in calling on the United Nations to \r\nact firmly by implementing effectively the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions on Yugoslavia, particularly resolution 757 (1992). The decision \r\nof the General Assembly to deny Serbia and Montenegro the seat of the former \r\nYugoslavia, as contained in resolution 47/1 of 22 September 1992, is a step in \r\nthe right direction. We believe the United Nations should not hesitate to use \r\nforce to stop Serbian aggression, in conformity with the provisions of \r\nArticle 42 of the United Nations Charter. In the meantime, the creation of an \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n127 \r\n(Mr. Sey. Gambia) \r\nair corridor to protect relief supplies and innocent civilians from aerial \r\nbombardment would provide a useful respite in a desperate situation. \r\nThe Gambia shares the concern of the international community over the \r\nlack of progress in finding a lasting solution to the conflict in Somalia. \r\nThe scale of human tragedy remains a constant reminder of the horrors and \r\nabsurdities of war. We fully endorse the urgent and effective implementation \r\nof Security Council resolution 767 (1992), which calls for the cessation of \r\nhostilities, national reconciliation and unity in Somalia and the opening up \r\nof the country to humanitarian assistance. \r\nMy delegation praises the laudable efforts of the United Nations, the \r\nUnited States of America and relief agencies for the assistance they are \r\nproviding to the starving population of Somalia. We want to appeal to all \r\nthose who exercise some influence over the various warring factions to use \r\ntheir influence now in support of Security Council resolution 767 (1992). \r\nWithout peace the humanitarian assistance will continue but so will the human \r\ntragedy. \r\nOn the question of Liberia, the Economic Community of West African States \r\n(ECOWAS) continues to grapple with the problem of effective implementation of \r\nthe Yamoussoukro IV accord in order to bring about lasting peace in Liberia \r\nand to arrest the growth of destabilizing forces in the subregion. We \r\ncontinue to appeal to all the parties concerned, in particular the leadership \r\nof the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, to adhere to the provisions of the \r\nYamoussoukro IV accord as further elaborated at Geneva in April this year. We \r\nmake a strong appeal to the United Nations and the international community to \r\ngive full support to the efforts of ECOWAS to bring about peace and stability \r\nin Liberia. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n128 \r\n(Mr. Sey. Gambia) \r\nWith reference to South Africa, it is disappointing to note that the \r\neuphoria and optimism that greeted the release of Nelson Mandela and other \r\nprisoners have failed to materialize into a free, democratic and non-racial \r\nSouth Africa. The suspension of the talks in the framework of the Convention \r\nfor a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) and the continued acts of violence and \r\nsenseless killings, as highlighted in Boipatong township in June and in Ciskei \r\nin September, call into guestion the commitment of the South African \r\nGovernment. We would like to state again that the South African Government \r\nbears a major responsibility for these acts of lawlessness. It will have to \r\ndemonstrate greater responsibility in ensuring the security of all South \r\nAfricans. It is time to turn this tragic page and allow discussions that will \r\nbring peace, stability and progress to South Africa. We appeal to all the \r\nparties to assist in this process. \r\nWe are following with keen interest the developments in the Middle East \r\npeace process which started in Madrid almost a year ago. We sincerely hope \r\nthat the opportunity provided by that process will be taken up by all the \r\nparties to ensure that the region, which has been denied peace for so long, \r\nwill ultimately enjoy a comprehensive and lasting peace on the basis of \r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). \r\nThe world has yet to become the haven of peace and stability we so \r\nearnestly work for. The conflicts in Cambodia, Afghanistan and some of the \r\nrecently independent republics of the former Soviet Union reflect the very \r\ndifficult moments of transition. We are confident that with the full support \r\nof the international community these difficulties will be overcome. \r\nAnother danger to world stability is poverty and lack of economic \r\ndevelopment. The developing countries continue to be saddled with overriding \r\nA / 4 7 / P V . 1 7 \r\n1 2 9 - 1 3 0 \r\n(Mr. Sev . Gamhia) \r\ndebt, low commodity prices and sluggish if not stagnant economies. Nowhere is \r\nthe situation more bleak and desperate as in Africa, where the cumulative debt \r\nstands at around $27 2 billion, the approximate equivalent of 90 per cent of \r\nthe continent\u0027s gross national product. Debt-service obligations require \r\nabout $25 billion annually, representing 30 per cent of the continent\u0027s export \r\nearnings. Failure to effect timely payments has led to increases in interest \r\npayments, at the rate of over $1 billion a year. \r\nI believe those figures are an eloquent testimony to the plight of Africa \r\ntoday. The rest of the world must not remain insensitive to that plight. The \r\nadoption at the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly of a new agenda \r\nfor the development of Africa in the 1990s has helped focus attention once \r\nagain on Africa\u0027s critical economic situation. We will need, however, to go \r\nbeyond words. In this connection I wish to echo the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\nproposals for the cancellation of all official bilateral debts, the \r\ncancellation of other semi-official debts such as export credits, and the \r\nsubstantial reduction of debts owed to multilateral financial institutions, \r\nwhich now account for 40 per cent of sub-Saharan debt servicing. \r\nIt is regrettable to note that these proposals, considered more \r\nfavourable to Africa than the Trinidad terms, have not yet received positive \r\nand widespread acceptance from Africa\u0027s development partners. Africa, like \r\nother developing regions, will require a substantial inflow of capital and \r\ntechnology and access to international markets if the global partnership is to \r\nhave any meaning for us. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n131 \r\n(Mr. Ray. Gambia) \r\nThe Gambia shares with the rest of Africa this very heavy financial \r\nburden, in spite of her efforts at economic recovery. In fact, the Gambia has \r\nsuccessfully undertaken an economic recovery programme, and has since \r\n1991 started a programme for sustained development. The main policy \r\norientation of the programme for sustained development is the pursuit of \r\ncontinuous adjustment with growth, with the objective of achieving economic \r\ndevelopment in a liberalized market environment. This will allow mobilization \r\nof the resources of the private sector to provide the investment that will \r\ngenerate sustained economic growth and expansion. By expanding the productive \r\ncapacity of the economy, we hope to be able to support a significant \r\nimprovement in the living standards of Gambians. \r\nThe attainment of economic growth requires a favourable external \r\nenvironment. Secondly, a conducive international economic and financial \r\nenvironment will help resolve the international debt crisis, restore adequate \r\ncapital flows and create a more open world trading system, which will result \r\nin sustained economic expansion and enhance private and public spending on \r\nhuman development. We fully appreciate the very valuable assistance being \r\ngiven by the United Nations, the international financial institutions and \r\nfriendly countries. However, there is a need for continued external \r\nassistance in support of our development efforts. In this regard, we \r\nfervently hope that the donors\u0027 conference for the Gambia, to be held in \r\nGeneva on 13 and 14 October 1992, will be as successful as previous ones. \r\nToday we are witnessing the emergence of a new world order grounded in \r\nthe principles of respect for human rights, political pluralism and \r\nself-determination. This lew world order, which is still unfolding, marks the \r\nend of the cold war and the beginning of a strengthened role for the United \r\nNations. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n132 \r\n(Mr. Sev. Gambia) \r\nIn Africa, marching side by side with the economic problems has been the \r\ndesire for greater democratization and liberalization of political attitudes, \r\nsystems and dogmas. In the face of this new socio-political revolution, the \r\nGambia has consistently maintained its practice of the rule of law, and \r\nadherence to parliamentary democracy, as exemplified by its successful and \r\nregular conduct of free and fair elections since the attainment of \r\nindependence in 1965. \r\nUnder the wise and distinguished leadership of \r\nAlhaji Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara, the Gambia continues to advocate the \r\npromotion of, and adherence to human rights practices all over the world. The \r\nGambia therefore welcomes the holding of the World Conference on Human Rights \r\nin 1993. That Conference will not only afford all peace-loving people, \r\nnations and institutions the opportunity to express their concern on human \r\nrights issues, but will also serve as a means for the objective evaluation of \r\nthe world\u0027s human rights records and practices and an opportunity for us to \r\nrededicate ourselves to the achievement of higher standards of human rights \r\npractices throughout the world. \r\nIn full recognition of the universal application of human rights and \r\ndemocracy, my delegation is pleased to note the implementation of General \r\nAssembly resolution 45/164, which proclaimed 1993 the International Year for \r\nthe World\u0027s Indigenous People. This proclamation will further strengthen \r\ninternational cooperation in seeking solutions to the problems confronting \r\nindigenous communities in the areas of human rights, the environment, \r\ndevelopment, education, and health, and we regard it as a first step towards \r\nmobilizing greater international support and assistance for the \r\nself-development of indigenous peoples and their communities. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n133 \r\n(Mr. Sey. Gambia) \r\nThe United Nations is particularly well placed to focus attention on \r\nmajor issues of concern to humankind. Of special interest to us today is the \r\nwelfare of children, which was brought to the forefront by the World Summit \r\nfor Children. The Gambia pledges to continue to formulate plans, programmes \r\nand laws to safeguard the rights and interests of children and women, who, \r\neffectively, constitute the most important and productive category of our \r\npopulation. \r\nThe Government of the Gambia fully supports the convening of the \r\nforthcoming international conference on assistance to African children, \r\nscheduled to take place in Dakar, Senegal from 25 to 27 November 1992. We \r\nstrongly urge the international community to lend support to that conference. \r\nMobilizing African and international support for the global goals for children \r\nin the 1990s is one of the biggest challenges we now face as a world \r\ncommunity. Together we can make the conference a significant step in the \r\nprocess towards achieving the goals of the World Summit. \r\nAnother major issue of global concern today is the question of AIDS and \r\nHIV infections, which, in the last few years, have grown into a global \r\npandemic with no effective cure as yet. It has been estimated that, by the \r\nend of this century, 40 million people will have been affected by the virus \r\nand more than 10 million children will have become orphans. This is indeed a \r\ngloomy prediction. The situation therefore calls for greater and more \r\nsustained efforts in combating the AIDS pandemic. It calls for collective \r\nglobal responsibility based on learning from, sharing with, and giving \r\nassistance to each other. \r\nMy delegation realizes that the United Nations will be increasingly \r\ncalled upon to undertake many more responsibilities in a world that is rapidly \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n134-135 \r\n(Mr. Sey. Gamhia) \r\nchanging. If it is to succeed in handling the growing complexities of today, \r\nthen it must be adequately structured to respond to the emerging challenges. \r\nThe Gambia has followed with keen interest the deliberations of the \r\nsubstantive session of the Economic and Social Council in July 1992, and the \r\nefforts to restructure the Council. Indeed, these efforts are part of the \r\nlarger and wider process of restructuring the United Nations system initiated \r\nby the Secretary-General. \r\nThe Gambia welcomes the creation of the Department of Humanitarian \r\nAffairs under the dynamic leadership of Jan Eliasson as \r\nUnder-Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Coordinator. The creation of \r\nthis Department is not only timely but crucial, given its role of providing \r\nrelief and solace to the millions of needy people all over the world, \r\nespecially in areas suffering from armed conflict, poverty, population \r\npressures, environmental degradation and human rights violations, in keeping \r\nwith the provisions and spirit of General Assembly resolution 46/182. \r\nIt is also gratifying to note that some of the recommendations of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development on the establishment \r\nof a Commission for Sustainable Development and issues relating to the global \r\nenvironment facility were considered and approved by the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. The addition of the high-level-segment debate in the plenary session \r\nof the Council and the dialogue between participants that accompanied it is \r\nalso welcome. \r\nA/47/PV. 17 \r\n136 \r\n(Mr. Sey. Gambia) \r\nWe in Africa continue to support General Assembly resolution 32/197, \r\nwhich calls for structural, administrative and financial reforms of the United \r\nNations system, particularly the strengthening of policy-making at the level \r\nof the General Assembly in the economic, social and other related fields. As \r\nwe begin the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly, our minds are \r\nstill fresh with some of the relevant and important recommendations of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council on the economic and social issues which affect the \r\nworld and demand urgent attention. \r\nWe are at an exciting junction of history. The positive changes we have \r\nwitnessed in global political and economic trends are a clear manifestation of \r\nmankind\u0027s desire for a progressive world and a better future. However, the \r\ngoals of global peace, security and progress will continue to elude us if \r\npoverty, human rights violations and economic disparity, which are at the root \r\nof many conflicts, continue to characterize our world. The United Nations has \r\na special role to play in combatting these evils. The Gambia remains fully \r\ncommitted to joining hands with all nations to support the United Nations in \r\nits crusade for a happier, more stable and prosperous world. \r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the general debate at this meeting. \r\nA representative has asked to exercise his right of reply. I should like \r\nto remind Members that in conformity with the decision 34/41 of the General \r\nAssembly, statements made in the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for \r\nthe first statement and 5 minutes for the second statement, and that \r\ndelegations should speak from their seats. \r\nI now call on the representative of Iraq. \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n137 \r\nMr. MALIK (Iraq) (interpretation from Arabic): I ask your \r\nindulgence and that of the delegates for taking the floor at this late hour. \r\nThe statement of the Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia regarding Iraq can \r\nbe described only as false claims and distortions of facts and realities. The \r\nMinister\u0027s aim was to camouflage the role his regime played in preparing for \r\nthe aggression against Iraq. Moreover, the delegation of Iraq was not at all \r\nsurprised that the Minister took lightly the question of sovereignty, after \r\nhis own regime has surrendered its sovereignty to those States in order to \r\nlaunch that aggression against Iraq. That regime continues to allow American \r\nand NATO planes to fly from its bases in order to violate the sovereignty of \r\nIraq. \r\nThe Iraqis will not surrender their sovereignty, independence or \r\nterritorial integrity as the others have done. The dignity of the Iraqis \r\nstands above defilement by a foreign aggressor. History will bear witness to \r\nthat fact. \r\nI must say that Iraq accepted Security Council resolutions and fulfilled \r\nthe major portion of its obligations under those resolutions. Every \r\nfair-minded observer knows that this is a fact. This will continue to be our \r\napproach. The time has come for the Security Council to fulfil its \r\nobligations towards Iraq and its people under the same resolutions. \r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): I now call on the \r\nrepresentative of Saudi Arabia. \r\nMr. ALLAGANY (Saudi Arabia) (interpretation from Arabic): What was \r\nmentioned by my\u0027Foreign Minister this evening was no more than statement of \r\nfacts that are known to be facts by the international community as a whole. I \r\nshould like to refer to passages from this speech on Iraq. The Foreign \r\nMinister started by saying that the United Nations has clearly demonstrated \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n138 \r\n(Mr. Allaoany. Saudi Arabia) \r\nits ability to discharge its role when it faced up firmly in the Gulf region \r\nto the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait. Where is the false claim in that? He \r\nthen went on to say that this stand has left the imprint of its image in our \r\nminds, and that we should express our gratitude for and appreciation of that \r\nstand. Where is the false claim in such a remark? The Minister subsequently \r\nmentioned the Iraqi regime\u0027s recent return to the pattern of false claims and \r\nthreats against Kuwait, and referred to that regime\u0027s failure to abide by \r\ninternational rules. Is this also a false claim? Iraq has refused to return \r\nover 2,000 prisoners of war from Kuwait and other countries; Iraq has refused \r\nto sell the quantity of oil allowed by the Security Council in order to save \r\nthe Iraqi people from famine - all that in order to avoid paying certain \r\ncompensations to the countries affected by the Iragi occupation of Kuwait. \r\nThere is also the war of extermination by poison gas against the Iraqi people \r\nto the North and the same to the south of Iraq. There is also a lack of \r\ncooperation with the United Nations and refusal to reveal the locations of \r\nchemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. This has obliged the \r\nSecurity Council to meet several times and to serve notice on the Iraqi regime \r\nto cooperate. There is also a repetition of the claims which brought \r\ndestruction to the region in general and to Iraq in particular, namely that \r\nKuwait is the nineteenth province of Iraq. \r\nThese acts prove to tne whole world that the Iraqi regime\u0027s behaviour in \r\nthe region contravenes all international norms, especially now when the world \r\nstands at the threshold of a new era which rejects the use of force or threat \r\nof the use of force and emphasizes a need to resort to peaceful means in the \r\nsettlement of international disputes. What has been done by the States of the \r\nA/47/PV.17 \r\n139 \r\n(Mr. Allaoany. Saudi Arahia) \r\nregion in order to defend themselves is a legitimate right called for by the \r\nCharter of this Organization, under which we meet, and the Iraqi regime must \r\nunderstand that. \r\nThe meeting rose at 7.55 p.m. \r\n"
