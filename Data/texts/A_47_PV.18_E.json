ABDOU DIOUF, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Senegal. \r\nMr. Abdou Diouf, President of the Republic of Senegal, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic of Senegal, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdou Diouf, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\nPresident DIOUF (interpretation from French): The United Nations \r\nwould appear today to be the ideal forum for seeking and identifying solutions \r\nto the problems of all kinds that are assailing the world. It is here that \r\nmodern history is being woven and it is here that ideas are expressed that \r\nplant the seeds of the future. That is both because the United Nations brings \r\ntogether almost every country and because the ideas on which it is based and \r\nthe principles which guide it arise from our most generous feelings the \r\nsense that we belong to the same humanity and are duty bound to preserve it. \r\nThus, it is always with hope that I speak before the Assembly. Today, \r\nmoreover, I am speaking on behalf of Africa and the Islamic Ummah. Speaking \r\non behalf of so many peoples is a heavy responsibility indeed, but one that is \r\nalso full of exaltation because of the hopes that underlie it. \r\nI am even happier to bear that responsibility because the choice of you, \r\nMr. President, to guide the work of the forty-seventh session of the General \r\nAssembly is a certain guarantee that it will take place smoothly and \r\nsuccesfully, for, in addition to your distinguish?d qualities as a diplomat, \r\nyou come from a country whose commitment to the triumph of the common ideals \r\nof the nations gathered together here has never been in doubt. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n3 \r\n(President Diouf) \r\nTherefore, from the bottom of my heart I address my warmest \r\ncongratulations to you. I wish you to know also, and in particular, that in \r\ncarrying out your important and sensitive mission you can always count on the \r\ncooperation of the Senegalese delegation and of all those on whose behalf I \r\nspeak at this session. \r\nTo your predecessor, Ambassador Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia, we pay a well-deserved tribute for his outstanding guidance of the \r\ndeliberations of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. For anyone \r\nwho knows the great gualities of his people, there is nothing surprising in \r\nthat. \r\nAs to the Secretary-General, I am pleased to say once again how satisfied \r\nwe are at seeing him occupy this prestigious post. Our fraternal and friendly \r\nsupport will always be with him in his efforts to ensure that the United \r\nNations plays the full role given it by the Charter and shoulders all the \r\nresponsibilities that derive from that Charter. Speaking of the role and \r\nresponsibilities of the United Nations, I cannot fail to emphasize the very \r\ngreat hopes that his election has aroused in us Africans. Like our Arab \r\nbrothers and all the peoples of the countries members of the Organization of \r\nthe Islamic Conference, we viewed his election as concrete proof of the \r\nuniversality of the United Nations. In fact, it constitutes a confirmation, \r\nfollowing upon the mandates assumed by Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, another \r\nnational of a developing country. All our best wishes are with the \r\nSecretary-General. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n4-5 \r\n(President Diouf) \r\nThanks to the atmosphere of detente prevailing today in international \r\nrelations, with the end of the cold war and of ideological tensions, the \r\ncredibility and image of our Organization have been greatly strengthened. For \r\nsome time now the United Nations has been demonstrating its effectiveness, in \r\nparticular through the tangible results in the area of peace-keeping. It has \r\nalso made significant progress in the slowing down of the arms race. In a \r\nword, what was unimaginable yesterday is now a part of everyday life, and in \r\nreferring to it we now speak of a \"new world order\". The expression is rather \r\nexplicit, because for all of us it bears upon the strengthening of \r\ninternational security and the guarantee of stability of international \r\nrelations. But the reality contained within it must also mean, for the \r\ndeveloping countries, a greater awareness of the aspirations of their peoples \r\nto well-being. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n6 \r\n(President Diouf) \r\nIn view of what is going on around us, we are still far from that \r\nsituation. Indeed, suffering and injustice are still the daily lot of \r\nmillions of men and women in several regions. What is even worse at this time \r\nof over-abundance, when one thinks about the milk and grain surpluses, people \r\ncontinue to die of hunger because they do not have the very strict minimum \r\nthey need. Similarly, people are still dying of diseases which medical \r\nprogress has now made it possible to cure. \r\nMoreover, from recovery plans to adjustment programmes, the economies of \r\nmany countries have lost their structure and become anaemic, and their \r\nGovernments find themselves virtually powerless. The case of Africa, in this \r\nregard, is tragically instructive. Its economic growth rates have remained at \r\ntheir lowest in proportion to population growth; investments are rarely seen \r\nand infrastructure needs are the most significant. \r\nHere is a continent which is rich in minerals and mining resources but in \r\nwhich paradoxically most of the poorest countries are to be found. \r\nThese sorry records are explained in part, by the youth of the countries \r\nthat make up Africa. But they are the result, above all, of its raw materials \r\nand other products being sold at prices fixed outside the continent and most \r\nof the time in total disregard of its interests. This situation is all the \r\nmore worrying because it has persisted I would even say worsened despite \r\nthe efforts of African leaders to improve it, especially since the beginning \r\nof the 1980s. \r\nThus, in 1986, when I was Acting President of the Organization of African \r\nUnity (OAU), I was mandated to appeal to the United Nations to deal with our \r\nspecific problems in a special way. Reacting positively, the United Nations \r\nconvened a special session of the General Assembly, which adopted the \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n7 \r\n(President Diouf) \r\nUnited Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and \r\nDevelopment 1986-1990 (UNPAAERD). \r\nThis document gave rise to the greatest hope because it was the fruit of \r\nunprecedented joint effort. It was, theoretically, a true solidarity pact. I \r\nsay \"pact\" because Africa had committed itself to set up the necessary \r\nstructures for launching autonomous long-term socio- economic growth and \r\ndevelopment programmes. The international community for its part agreed to \r\nhelp Africa achieve that goal. \r\nThis dual commitment was expressly entered into in UNPAAERD, which made \r\nit clear in particular that the international community would spare no effort \r\nto provide sufficient resources to support and complement the development \r\nefforts of Africa. That was clear. \r\nUnfortunately, we must recognize that, while the African countries took \r\nthe measures agreed upon, the same cannot be said of the international \r\ncommunity as a whole, even if some countries of the North had a friendly and \r\nunderstanding attitude in our regard. Will the United Nations New Agenda for \r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADA) be treated differently, more \r\ngenerously? Undoubtedly it will be, if it is applied, because its commitments \r\nare firm and precise, and follow-up, monitoring and assessment mechanisms have \r\nbeen provided, thanks to which the two parties will be able to work together \r\non a permanent basis. Thus, they will be able together and at regular and \r\nshort intervals to ensure respect for the commitments agreed upon. It is \r\nperhaps these frequent meetings which were missing in the implementation \r\nprocess of UNPAAERD. \r\nI hope that that is the only explanation for the modest results of that \r\ndocument. But for the time being, I note that Africa is prey to the same \r\ndifficulties, some of which have even worsened. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n8 \r\n(President Diouf) \r\nThat is the case with its external debt, the repayment of which consumes \r\nthe bulk of the meagre financial resources left to Africa owing to worsening \r\nterms of trade. \r\nSince lending countries are slow in agreeing to hold an international \r\nconference devoted to this problem, we are making an urgent appeal to all \r\nStates and all international financial institutions so that together we can \r\nexplore other ways to solve the problem. Otherwise, it will be illusory to \r\nexpect the African countries to give all due attention to problems of common \r\ninterest. Quite naturally, they will devote their energies, on a priority \r\nbasis, to the struggle for the survival of their peoples. The persistence of \r\nthe African debt problem could even have other negative and more immediate \r\nconsequences; population movement from the South to the countries of the North \r\nhave already shown that this risk exists. \r\nTo this already grim picture we must add the increasingly evident \r\nprecariousness of the African environment, which is illustrated by the \r\ndevastating drought which has hit the southern part of the continent, after \r\nhaving wreaked on the Sahel the damage of which we are all aware. We must \r\nalso add to this the lightning spread of the acquired immune deficiency \r\nsyndrome (AIDS), along with other diseases which have disappeared elsewhere, \r\nand the number of hotbeds of tension which already exist, not to mention those \r\nwhich may yet arise. \r\nIn this respect, it is South Africa which first comes to mind. None the \r\nless, one would have thought a few months ago that the present session would \r\nbe the opportunity for the international community to rejoice over the \r\nirreversible changes since the advent of President Frederick De Klerk. But \r\nwhat do we see today, over and above the formal abrogation - I was going to \r\nsay theoretical abrogation of the apartheid laws? \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n9 \r\n(President Diouf) \r\nBlacks still do not have the same rights as the rest of South African \r\nsociety, and violence has been omnipresent in recent months, sometimes \r\nachieving proportions which cast doubt upon the willingness of the South \r\nAfrican Government to change. The continuation of such an atmosphere would be \r\na serious threat to the progress we have all welcomed. \r\nThat is why at the twenty-eighth regular summit meeting of the OAU, held \r\nat Dakar, it was felt necessary to take the matter to the Security Council. \r\nIn my capacity as Acting President of that pan-African organization, I should \r\nlike, on behalf of the continent, to express my sincerest thanks to the \r\nmembers of this organ of our universal Organization for the diligence and \r\nsense of solidarity with which they responded to our appeal by adopting \r\nSecurity Council resolution 765 (1992), which invites the South African \r\nauthorities to take the appropriate measures to end the violence. \r\nI also wish to avail myself of this opportunity to repeat our commitment \r\nto a negotiated solution in South Africa and the hope generated by the recent \r\nMandela-De Klerk summit meeting. We hope that the talks to be resumed within \r\nthe Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) after that meeting will \r\nmake it possible speedily to harmonize the positions of the parties and make \r\nirreversible the resolute march of South Africa towards a non-racial, \r\ndemocratic and united society. \r\nThe civil war in Liberia is another source of concern for Africa. It is \r\nall the more worrying since it has continued even after a framework for a \r\npeaceful settlement had been drawn up by the countries in the subregion. \r\nAs the Head of State of a country member of the Committee of Five of the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) that was set up to resolve \r\nthe crisis, I can testify to the fact that this framework was conceived with \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n10 \r\n(President Diouf) \r\nthe sole concern of helping our Liberian brothers regain peace. After several \r\nmeetings, we adopted it with the agreement of all of the parties. But the \r\nbitter fact remains that the horizon is dark because the Economic Community of \r\nWest African States Monitoring Group (EC0M0G), the centre-piece of the \r\nagreed-upon arrangement, does not have the means for its peace mission. \r\nThat is why, while thanking those who have already given us their \r\nsupport, I should like to ask the United Nations to provide increased \r\nassistance. In the absence of such a gesture, we risk seeing the Liberian \r\ncrises continue. It is already a serious threat to the stability of the West \r\nAfrican subregion, and in human terms it is a catastrophe with lasting \r\nconsequences. \r\nI now come to the most absurd and perhaps most devastating tragedy \r\nAfrica has known in recent years. I refer to the civil war in Somalia. This \r\ncountry, once so welcoming, today is a hell on earth. It is the picture of \r\nanarchy, of intolerance in all its forms, of violence, and of the failure of \r\nman before his destiny. \r\nSenegal, for its part, is doing everything in its power to help end this \r\ntragedy which, should it persist, would run the risk of sounding the death \r\nknell of the very existence of Somalia. It is doing so for humanitarian \r\nreasons, for reasons of African solidarity and, in brief, for reasons of \r\ncommon sense. It is also doing so in its capacity as a member of the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the OAU and the United Nations. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n11 \r\n(President Diouf) \r\nLet me take this opportunity to note that, together with the Organization \r\nof the Islamic Conference, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the \r\nLeague of Arab States, our organization is already engaged in significant \r\nefforts for Somalia. But the situation there is so grave that we must give it \r\nhigh priority in the days and weeks ahead if we are not to witness the \r\ngenocide of a people through the death of its children. I appeal also to \r\nnon-governmental organizations; I encourage them to continue their generous \r\nactivities in Somalia. \r\nThe parties to the conflict must understand that the interest of the \r\nSomali people lies in the restoration of peace, and that rivalries that \r\nsacrifice human lives by the thousand can only result in their claims becoming \r\npointless. \r\nWhat I would truly like to see is an international conference on \r\nSomalia. I therefore solemnly propose that such a meeting take place as soon \r\nas possible in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations, the OAU, the \r\nLeague of Arab States, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the \r\nEuropean Community. The goal would be to put a rapid end to the armed \r\nconfrontation and define a framework for a peaceful settlement of the crisis \r\nacceptable to all parties. The United Nations would take the initiative here, \r\nbut the modalities of the meeting would be defined among all the organizers, \r\nwho would also jointly agree on the list of participants. For my part, I \r\nshould be represented there both as current Chairman of the OAU and as \r\nPresident of the sixth Islamic summit. \r\nBut I cannot stress too forcefully that while awaiting that conference, \r\nfor which we earnestly wish, the international community must continue to help \r\nthe victims of the confrontations imposed upon the Somali people by armed \r\nfactions. In particular, it should do everything it can to ensure that the \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n12 \r\n(President Diouf) \r\narms embargo imposed in Security Council resolution 733 (1992) of \r\n23 January 1992 is strictly observed, and should take every other possible \r\ninitiative to put an end to the violence and the suffering. That wish of the \r\nOAU is shared by the Organization of the Islamic Conference, of which Somalia \r\nis a member. \r\nMy rehearsal of tensions in Africa would be incomplete without a \r\nreference to Western Sahara. I wholeheartedly wish for a settlement to that \r\nmatter; this could be reached quickly within the framework defined by the \r\nOAU. Nor can I omit to mention the fragile peace in Angola and elsewhere on \r\nthe continent. \r\nSpeaking of peace, I cannot fail to reiterate how much the peoples I \r\nrepresent here cherish peace. In our societies, everything boils down to the \r\nhuman being; peace is naturally one of the reference values. That was one of \r\nthe observations of the sixth summit of the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference. \r\nIn Africa, the Heads of State or Government of the States members of the \r\nOAU proved their commitment to peace by deciding at the most recent summit, \r\nheld at Dakar, to establish a mechanism for preventing, managing and settling \r\nconflicts. That mechanism is intended to respond to Africa\u0027s desire for the \r\nmeans to prevent conflicts, through an ongoing analysis of situations, putting \r\nan end to those that persist in spite of our efforts. Africa is thus in step \r\nwith United Nations concerns on the maintenance of peace, as set out by the \r\nSecretary-General in his report \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277). \r\nThat is because the Secretary-General\u0027s vision of peace is reflected \r\ntoday in the determination resolutely to address the continent\u0027s political and \r\neconomic problems. Without a doubt, this is a manifestation of Africa\u0027s \r\nself-confidence, and proves that our continent\u0027s de facto marginalization has \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n13 \r\n(President Diouf) \r\nnot paralysed it. On the contrary, its self-confidence has never been \r\ndisconnected from the spread of multiparty democracy; indeed, without it, the \r\ncurrent trends would certainly not be so clear. \r\nDemocracy has made great progress in Africa in recent months. \r\nAuthoritarian regimes have yielded to democratically elected Governments; \r\neverywhere, confrontation is yielding to joint efforts and bullets to ballots. \r\nOur efforts at integration derive also from our determination to take our \r\ndestiny in our own hands and is an expression of our self-confidence. The \r\nsame holds true for the way in which we are addressing environmental problems \r\nand for our determination not to miss the energy revolution that is appearing \r\non the horizon. It is significant that, with respect to our commitment in \r\nthat sphere, we have placed our bets on solar energy. It is abundant in our \r\ncountries and can reconcile the need for healthy environment with that for \r\ndevelopment. \r\nIf these efforts can be pursued and if their orientation can be \r\nmaintained - and we are determined that they should be Africa will soon be \r\nin a position to overcome its present situation. But again: to achieve the \r\nexpected effects we must have consistent support from the international \r\ncommunity. We have seen this with the United Nations Programme of Action for \r\nAfrican Economic Recovery and Development. \r\nWe know too that the solution or prevention of conflicts in Africa will \r\nbe possible only if arms supplies to belligerents and other forms of outside \r\nintervention are halted. Everyone knows that democracy in Africa can be \r\nconsolidated only if it is followed by progress towards, inter alia, economic \r\ngrowth based on a rationalization of development efforts. This requires \r\nimproved relations within Africa, adequate infrastructure, and the possibility \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n14 \r\n(President Diouf) \r\nfor African countries to ensure that their products can reach northern markets \r\nat profitable prices. \r\nAlthough Africa is certainly the continent most severely affected by \r\neconomic crisis, war and other conflicts, we have no monopoly on these evils: \r\nother peoples are suffering too, and we stand in solidarity with them. That \r\nis why, although I have spoken at some length about Africa, I must not neglect \r\nthe tragedies being played out elsewhere. \r\nI am far from indifferent to the economic difficulties of Latin America \r\nlike ours, caused in large part by unfair international economic relations \r\nto the need to consolidate peace in Cambodia through scrupulous respect for \r\nthe Paris agreements, and to the need for Afghanistan to take the path of \r\nnational reconciliation. We in Africa are also concerned about the situation \r\nin some of the former Soviet republics and in the former Yugoslavia, as well \r\nas about the unacceptable state of affairs that continues to be imposed on the \r\nPalestinian people. \r\nOn Bosnia and Herzegovina, we approve of the initiatives to ease the \r\nsuffering of the population, to halt the violence, and to put an end to what \r\nappears to be an attempt at \"ethnic cleansing\". As President of the sixth \r\nIslamic summit, I sent a representative ot the recent London Conference on the \r\nformer Yugoslavia. I shall continue to associate myself with all steps in \r\nthat direction, and I call on the United Nations to continue, even increase, \r\nits efforts. \r\nWith respect to the question of Palestine, while we welcome the positive \r\ndevelopments in the way it is being handled in the context of the ongoing \r\npeace process under the sponsorship of the United States of America and \r\nRussia, we must observe that the process is far from meeting our \r\nexpectations. But there is reason to hope that with the new Israeli \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n15 \r\n(President Diouf) \r\nGovernment significant progress will be achieved and that the heroic \r\nPalestinian people will soon be free, under the leadership of the Palestine \r\nLiberation Organization, to exercise its inalenable rights. We call on the \r\nIsraeli Government to show realism and political courage, and we urge all \r\nparties to have a sense of history. It is only in that way that peace can be \r\nrestored and that the Arab world and Israel can draw upon their rich common \r\nheritage and their vast economic potential. \r\nTo face these challenges and realize the potential that is present \r\ndespite all the problems, we need greater solidarity, both among people and \r\namong nations. I am thinking of a \"general agreement on solidarity\". As \r\ndistinct from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, this moral contract \r\nwould make possible the effective implementation of all the provisions of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. This presupposes awareness that we all share the same \r\nfuture and that we agree to bear an equal interest in the maintenance of \r\npeace, the promotion of human rights and democracy both nationally and \r\nworldwide, the struggle against poverty and the protection of the \r\nenvironment. There is no lack of opportunity: let us begin at this session \r\nof the General Assembly. Clearly, this would be the best way to move towards \r\nthe new world order to which we all aspire. \r\nTo be sure, with respect to the maintenance of peace, the United \r\nNations to which we pay an enthusiastic tribute - under the dynamic \r\nleadership of the Secretary-General is making notable efforts to respond to \r\nthe many demands upon it. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n16 \r\n(President Diouf) \r\nTo be sure, in the Middle East, in the rest of Asia, in Africa and in \r\nEurope, United Nations peace-keeping forces, in most of which my country is \r\nproud to participate, are carrying out their missions courageously, loyally \r\nand effectively, and for the most part to the great satisfaction of the \r\npeoples of those regions. \r\nWe must, however, recognize that this universal Organization is not \r\nequally successful everywhere its intervention is desired and necessary. \r\nOften this is because of the Charter requirement that regional organizations \r\nplay the primary role in the settlement of regional disputes, but we must \r\nrealize that their effectiveness is limited in the case of armed confrontation \r\nbecause they do not have the means required for peace-keeping operations. \r\nI believe that fidelity to the spirit of the Charter in this regard \r\nrequires the establishment and operation of a system of co-operation between \r\nthe United Nations and the regional organizations so that they may benefit \r\nfrom appropriate technical and financial assistance and thus can become more \r\ninvolved in the management and settlement of regional conflicts. I am happy \r\nto note that this is the thrust of the report of the Secretary-General \r\nentitled \"Agenda for peace\". \r\nIn any case, this is what should flow from our concern to preserve our \r\ncollective security. That is clear militarily, but it is also increasingly \r\ntrue with regard to the other aspects of security. No one is unaware that \r\nthose aspects are equally important. Thus the strong solidarity I have been \r\nadvocating, through the \"general agreement on solidarity\", presupposes also \r\nthe resumption of the North-South dialogue. More exactly, it will be a \r\nguestion of engagement in a new dialogue between the developed and the \r\ndeveloping countries. I say \"new\" because the dialogue would be imbued with \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n17 \r\n(President Diouf) \r\nthe spirit of partnership and agreement to joint responsibility in facing \r\ncommon challanges: challanges involved in economic and trade problems as well \r\nas environment and health. The General Assembly could ask the \r\nSecretary-General to make concrete proposals along those lines at its next \r\nsession. \r\nI am among those who believe dialogue would be easier if the solidarity \r\nwe are seeking to promote were indeed effective at the regional level, and it \r\nwill be necessary for that to be taken into account in the efforts under way \r\nin the regional groups. \r\nThat is one of the reasons why Senegal has made the achievement of \r\nAfrican integration, as advocated in the Treaty setting up the African \r\nEconomic Community, one of its main priorities in matters of foreign policy. \r\nThat explains our commitment to the Organization of the Islamic Conference \r\n(OIC). But a reminder is needed here. The OIC is not a religious \r\norganization. Its objective is to organize solidarity among its member \r\nStates, whose peoples are united by the same faith and have the same \r\nconcerns. It already is a very good tool for political and cultural \r\nco-operation, and it is our ambition to make it an effective instrument for \r\neconomic, commercial and technical co-operation. The Dakar Summit of last \r\nDecember was a turning-point in this respect. Of the groups that must have \r\nour attention in the framework of the rebalancing of international economic \r\nrelations, I must mention the Summit Group for Consultation and the \r\nSouth-South Co-operation Group, the so-called Group of 15, whose goal is to \r\nmake South-South co-operation effective through the drawing up and \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n18 \r\n(President Diouf) \r\nimplementation of specific projects. But I hasten to make it clear that that \r\ngroup is not a closed club; indeed, everything that is discussed there is at \r\nthe disposal of the other developing countries; nor does it claim to be a \r\nspokesman for the entire South. However, I am convinced that it does \r\nconstitute a framework for the definition of the common concerns of the \r\ncountries of the South with regard to specific questions, and for the \r\nexpression of their views. Moreover, it has drawn up and circulated a \r\nposition paper on the new world order. \r\nReturning to the North-South dialogue and to the \"general agreement on \r\nsolidarity\", which should promote the dialogue while belief in it may be \r\nunrealistic, and the meetings that have taken place so far have been rather \r\ndisappointing for the most part, the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro last \r\nJune has given us reason for greater optimism. Indeed, while far from \r\nperfect, it worked for the taking into account, in the long term, of all the \r\nconcerns and perspectives of the world. It is not an exaggeration to say that \r\nafter Rio nothing is the same as before in approaching environmental problems \r\nand their interrelationship with development. What is even better, the change \r\nthat has taken place thanks to a real awareness of the globalization of \r\nmankind\u0027s problems could be the dawn of the new world order. The forthcoming \r\nconvening of certain international conferences gives us the opporunity to \r\nconfirm and amplify on that change. \r\nI believe that the World Conference on Human Rights planned for 1993 and \r\nthe International Conference on Population and Development to take place in \r\n1994 reflect our common willingness to deal with guestions that no longer know \r\nany borders. The same is true of the Fourth World Conference on Women and the \r\nWorld Summit on Social Development, both planned for 1995. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n19-20 \r\n(President Diouf) \r\nIs it not significant that those meetings were programmed after the Rio \r\nSummit on Environment and Development, as well as the World Summit for \r\nChildren? In any case, we must hope that, like their two predecessors, these \r\nother conferences will not lose sight of the need to ensure the follow-up on \r\ndecisions and recommendations that would make their work fruitful. \r\nIn this regard it is a pleasure for me to announce on this day, which \r\ncoincides with the second anniversary of the World Summit for Children, that, \r\nin the spirit of that historic meeting, an international conference on \r\nassisting African children, organized by the Organization of African Unity \r\nwith the support of UNICEF, will take place in Dakar from \r\n25 to 27 November 1992. Our goal is to bring the international community to a \r\npoint where it thinks about the special situation of African children and the \r\ndifficulties facing the African countries with regard to ensuring their \r\nharmonious development, or indeed their mere survival. This situation and \r\nthese problems will also be focused on in meetings to be held soon devoted to \r\nchildren in French-speaking countries and also within the framework of the OIC. \r\nWhile reflecting a real awareness of the interdependence of the world, at \r\nwhich we rejoice, the programme of international meetings I have just \r\nmentioned shows that much remains to be done in this vast field through joint \r\nefforts. In particular I have in mind disarmament for the benefit of \r\ndevelopment, the easing of the foreign debt burden of the developing \r\ncountries, the removal of protectionist tariff barriers, the improvement of \r\ncommodity prices, and the transfer of the technology and human resources \r\nnecessary for development. No one denies that today our collective survival \r\nlargely depends upon adequate consideration of these questions and the \r\nchallenges of the environment, AIDS and drugs not to mention the problem of \r\npeace-keeping operations. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n21 \r\n(President Diouf) \r\nHence, it is urgent to achieve greater solidarity, to which I referred \r\nearlier. Moreover, there is a central role that the United Nations must play \r\nin dealing with these problems. There is no need to emphasize that such a \r\nrole requires that this universal Organization review its methods of work and \r\nthat Member States reassess the means made available to the United Nations. \r\nIn Africa and within the Islamic Ummah we recognize the importance of the \r\nrestructuring and other work to restore dynamism to our Organization being \r\ncarried out by the Secretary-General and by such organs as the Economic and \r\nSocial Council, which is intended to cope with the new burdens arising from \r\nworld developments. On their behalf, I welcome the results already achieved \r\nin this regard, and I encourage a continuation of those efforts until they are \r\nsuccessful and the goals are reached. I particularly hope that this new trend \r\nwill duly take account of what are in our view two essential ideas on the \r\none hand, peace and security are precarious without the eradication of poverty \r\nand misery and without a reduction of the gap separating the North and the \r\nSouth; on the other hand, efforts towards effectiveness should not sacrifice \r\nthe democratic spirit by which the uriversality of the United Nations is \r\nmaintained. \r\nMoreover, the Tenth Conference of the Heads of State or Government of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, which was just held successfully in Jakarta, bore the \r\nstamp of renewal in continuity and achieved considerable progress in \r\nreinforcing that trend. \r\nGiven the scores of challenges and the ever stronger commitment of the \r\nnon-governmental organizations working alongside Governments to meet those \r\nchallenges, I would add the need to take into account the recommendations of \r\nthose organizations. I am thinking even that we could study the possibility. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n22 \r\n(President Diouf) \r\nthrough the efforts of the Secretary-General, of requiring such \r\nrecommendations to be taken into account in specific fields. \r\nI have had the signal honour to address you on behalf of various peoples \r\nsome of which are separated by thousands of kilometres. But these peoples \r\nshare with my country Senegal the same faith in human solidarity, the same \r\nhope for a better tomorrow, even the same goals. United in their diversity, \r\nthese peoples are calling for justice where it is trampled and peace wherever \r\nit is threatened. They are calling for the coming of a world in which hunger, \r\nintolerance and unfairness have disappeared. These peoples call upon you to \r\nact together, to innovate and to do so without delay. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe President of the Republic of Senegal for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Abdou Diouf. President of the Republic of Senegal, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued) \r\nGENERAL DEBATE \r\nMr. AL-THANI (Qatar) (interpretation from Arabic): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to express to you. Sir, my sincere congratulations as you assume \r\nthis high post. Your election is an expression of the confidence you enjoy. \r\nIt also emphasizes the role your country, Bulgaria, plays at the regional and \r\nworld levels and reflects the relations of friendship and cooperation it has \r\nmaintained with other countries of the world. \r\nI would like, in this connection, to commend your predecessor in the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly, Ambassador Samir Shihabi, who conducted \r\nthe work of the previous session of the Assembly with high efficiency. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n23-25 \r\n(Mr. Al-Thani. Qatar) \r\nOur current session, the first to be held since our present \r\nSecretary-General, Ambassador Boutros Boutros-Ghali, assumed his high office, \r\nis convened at the threshold of a new era of profound change with which the \r\nworld Organization must come to grips in a manner that would enhance its \r\neffectiveness and credibility, now that the old bipolarity has disappeared and \r\nthe burdens faced by the United Nations in every field have increased. There \r\nis a great deal of hope set by the peoples of the world on our Organization. \r\nIn this context, I would like to pay tribute to the former \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, whose term ended with the \r\nconclusion of our last session. \r\nIn this hall 179 delegations are meeting. Our Organization started with \r\n51 Member States in 1945. This increase in membership reflects the success of \r\nthe United Nations in eliminating colonialism, and upholding the right of \r\npeoples to self-determination and independence. By so doing, the United \r\nNations has achieved the aim of universal membership. This is an achievement \r\nwe should be proud of and we look forward to seeing it become a launching pad \r\nfrom which the Organization would proceed to translate the noble principles \r\nand objectives of the Charter from the realm of ideas to the world of \r\nreality. \r\nThe State of Qatar shares with all Member States the desire of \r\nreactivating and developing the United Nations in a manner that would be \r\ncompatible with the new world situation and which would strengthen the \r\nOrganization\u0027s role in maintaining peace and stability in the world. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n26 \r\n(Mr. Al-Thani. Qatar) \r\nWe believe that that desired stability will be achieved only through the \r\ncreation of effective mechanisms for resolving disputes that arise between \r\nStates either by diplomatic means, such as direct dialogue and mediation, or \r\nby recourse to international law as applied by the International Court of \r\nJustice. \r\nDespite the end of the cold war and the bipolarity which were among the \r\ncauses of the arms race, arms limitation continues to be one of the main \r\nconcerns of the United Nations. It was hoped that the end of the cold war \r\nwould mean a significant and speedy reduction in the magnitude of that arms \r\nrace. However, this has not been the case. In 1990, experts estimated that \r\n15 per cent of the aggregate of all Government budgets in the world is still \r\nbeing spent on armaments and military preparedness. This is a much higher \r\npercentage than that of expenditure on education or on health care. The \r\nburden of military expenditure weighs more heavily on developing countries \r\nthan on industrialized countries because of the discrepancy between the two \r\ngroups of countries in the area of disposable resources. \r\nIf we look carefully into the new developments in nuclear armaments we \r\nfind that the situation is much worse. For while we go on wasting the \r\nvaluable resources which should be used for development and the building of a \r\nbetter future for man, we endanger that very future with nuclear armament. \r\nTherefore, the problem of arms control will remain one of the central issues \r\nwhich the Organization will continue to address in the near future just as it \r\nused to do in the past. \r\nWe in the Gulf region, because of what we went through during the war of \r\nliberation of our sister State of Kuwait, have a -pecial interest in \r\nprohibiting chemical and other weapons of mass destruction and we attach the \r\ngreatest of hopes on the success of the Conference on Disarmament in rapidly \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n27 \r\n(Mr. Al-Thani. Qatar) \r\nconcluding a convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons and preventing \r\nthe spread of research and production techniques in this field in accordance \r\nwith General Assembly resolutions, particularly those adopted in the course of \r\nits last session. \r\nIn this connection, I should like to point out the necessity of \r\ncompliance by Israel, and by all other States of the Middle East, with this \r\nconvention, both the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and \r\nwith the regime of international inspection. This should in adherence to the \r\nprinciples of equality and justice and the need to ensure the security of all \r\nStates of the region without bias or discrimination. Failure by any State in \r\nthe region to comply with both agreements, or the accordance of special \r\ntreatment to any of those States would render the whole endeavour void of \r\nseriousness and effectiveness. Therefore, we call upon the international \r\ncommunity to ensure compliance therewith by Israel. \r\nThe guestion of Palestine is one of the questions that have been with the \r\nUnited Nations since its inception and still awaits a solution. My country \r\nattaches great importance to this question and hopes for rapid progress \r\ntowards its solution in the framework of the ongoing peace process. \r\nThe question of the Palestinian people and the denial by Israel of the \r\ninalienable rights of that people is the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict and \r\nonce the solution of the guestion of Palestine has been achieved in a manner \r\nthat would be acceptable to the Palestinians, we will also accept it. If \r\nIsrael wants to live in peace it should withdraw, not only from the West Bank \r\nand the Gaza Strip, but also from all the occupied Arab territories, including \r\nEast Jerusalem, the Golan and southern Lebanon, in accordance with the United \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n28 \r\n(Mr. Al-Thani. Qatar) \r\nNations Charter and relevant resolutions which stipulate the inadmissibility \r\nof the acquisition or annexation of territories by force, and that it is \r\nillegal to occupy the territories of others by military force. \r\nThe State of Qatar welcomes the resumption of negotiation between the \r\nconcerned parties in Washington and reaffirms its commitment to support the \r\npeace effort and expresses its hope that a lasting, equitable and \r\ncomprehensive solution will be reached to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the \r\nquestion of Palestine on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) \r\nand 338 (1973). \r\nThe delegation of my country wishes to voice in this world forum its deep \r\nconcern over the continued suffering of the brotherly people of Somalia and we \r\nappeal to all Somali factions to put an end to the bloodshed, set aside their \r\ndifferences and put the national interest first. My country commends the \r\nincreasing efforts made by the United Nations at present to alleviate the \r\nsuffering of that people in a bid to move towards restoring stability to that \r\nafflicted country. \r\nAs for the situation in the Gulf, my country reaffirms its commitment to \r\nthe joint political position of its sister countries, members of the Gulf \r\nCooperation Council (GCC) with a view to preserving security and peace in the \r\nregion, which in turn would contribute to achieving the desired peace in the \r\nworld. \r\nWith regard to the island of Abu Mousa, it is regrettable indeed that at \r\nthis historic stage through which our region is passing such a dispute should \r\narise between the two neighbours, the State of the United Arab Emirates and \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran. Out of our deep concern for the safety and \r\nstability of the region, we believe that this dispute should be resolved by \r\npeaceful means, through dialogue or by recourse to the law. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n29 \r\n(Mr. Al-Thani. Qatar) \r\nThe disintegration of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has led \r\nto serious consequences that have shaken the conscience of humanity. My \r\ncountry is especially concerned over the acts of aggression committed against \r\nthe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and characterized by extreme violence, \r\nparticularly against the Muslim population of that Republic, with the aim of \r\ndriving the Muslims out of their homes and country under the slogan of \"ethnic \r\ncleansing\". \r\nIt is the duty of the international community to stand up to this \r\naggression so that the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is a Member \r\nState of the United Nations, may preserve its right to freedom and \r\nindependence. \r\nIn his statement made in December 1991 after his election as \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali cited the indebtedness of \r\ndeveloping countries as one of the more complicated problems which face the \r\nworld economy and which all States must address effectively and decisively. \r\nThe former Secretary-General, also, had often drawn attention to this problem, \r\nthe existence and gravity of which is not hidden from experts and from the \r\nStates that suffer from its worsening burden which weighs heavily on the \r\ndeveloping countries and often makes them unable to meet their economic \r\nobligations, with dire social consequences. \r\nIt is self-evident that meeting the burden of foreign debt in every \r\ndebtor country would be at the expense of its social programmes and its \r\nefforts to raise the-standard of living of its people and thus those poor \r\ncountries become even poorer. The problem of foreign debt must be dealt with \r\ndecisively. \r\nThe United Nations has shown its great concern over the problems of the \r\nenvironment by convening the Rio de Janeiro Conference in mid-1992. Even if \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n30 \r\n(Mr. Al-Thani. Qatar) \r\nthat Conference did not rise fully to the level of the hopes set on it, it \r\nmarked, nevertheless, a positive beginning that could serve as a point of \r\ndeparture for more effective efforts to protect the environment without \r\nunnecessary shackles that may impede economic development in developing \r\ncountries in the name of the protection of the environment which no one \r\ndisputes. \r\nThe peoples of the world look forward to the formulation of a new world \r\norder which would ensure world peace and rest on the foundations of \r\ninternational law, the principles of justice and equality and of cooperation \r\nand brotherhood. That new world order should not inherit the negative \r\nattributes of the old order that led to the creation of blocs, conflicts and \r\npolarization with all the attendant evils of underdevelopment, poverty, \r\nbackwardness, hunger, ignorance and disease. The concept of the new world \r\norder should be wide enough to embrace international cooperation and \r\nunshackled trade and should address the problems of economic development, side \r\nby side with the issues of disarmament, indebtedness, environmental protection \r\nand social problems. \r\nIf the new world order is to govern the political, economic and social \r\ninternational relations between States, all States must share, on an equal \r\nfooting, in its formulation so that it may become an equitable world order \r\nthat truly represents the joint will of the international community and thus \r\nenable the human race to build a safe and happy world, for the present and \r\nfuture generations.* \r\n* Mr. Moumin (Comoros), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n31 \r\nMr. SAHLOUL (Sudan) (interpretation from Arabic): Allow me, at the \r\noutset, to congratulate Mr. Ganev, on behalf of my delegation, on his election \r\nto the presidency of this important session of the General Assembly, and to \r\nextend to his predecessor, through him, our thanks and appreciation for the \r\nskilful manner in which he conducted the work of the previous session. From \r\nthis rostrum, I also extend our sincere congratulations to the States that \r\nhave joined the membership of this Organization since the previous session. \r\nWe welcome them as a new driving force that contributes to the various efforts \r\ndeployed in the international arena with a view to bringing about prosperity, \r\ndevelopment, and stability for the peoples and communities of the world. \r\nThis session, we have before us an important agenda at all political, \r\neconomic, social, humanitarian, and security levels. All of us must be aware \r\nthat, today, the world faces a new set of international phenomena that were \r\nnot active before the Gulf war and its consequences whose impact is being \r\nincreasingly felt on the international arena from one day to the next. \r\nFor our part, we recognize that new and different international \r\ncircumstances emerge with the dawn of every day. The barrier of the \r\nideologies which, in the past, immersed the world in conflict, confrontation \r\nand competition for the sake of narrow interests, has collapsed. The \r\nimprovement in East-West relations has opened up new vistas. However, the \r\nperiod of transition we are living through has spawned new contradictory \r\ntendencies, the most conspicuous of which is an intense acerbity in the \r\nrelations of the wealthy North and the poor South under the circumstances of \r\nthe so-called new world order. On the other hand, unipolarity has led the \r\nworld into a new security system controlled by a handful of major Powers in \r\nthe complete absence of active participation on the part of the rest of the \r\ninternational community. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n32 \r\n(Mr. Sahloul. Sudan) \r\nThe era of international detente we hear so much about nowadays, is no \r\nmore, in our view, than detente between those major Powers with their economic \r\nand military muscle. That detente has yet to address the closing of the wide \r\ngap between North and South, it has yet to reform international economic and \r\ncommercial relations and it has yet to address the issues of overriding \r\nconcern to the South, such as the debt burden, poverty, illiteracy and \r\ndisease. On top of all that, the States of the developing world are being \r\nsubjected now to the practices of the so-called new international legality \r\nwhich means, inter alia, interference and intervention in the internal affairs \r\nof those States and pursuance of the policies of diktat which deprive them of \r\nthe right of making their own decisions. \r\nIn the tenth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, which concluded its \r\nmeetings in Jakarta a few weeks ago, the Presidents and Heads of Government of \r\nthe Movement deliberated over the current international situation and the role \r\nof the Movement therein. They have voiced their conviction that the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, being the representative of the largest grouping of \r\nStates and peoples in the world, has a role to play in the context of the \r\nunipolarity that reigns in the world today and, therefore, should be included \r\nin a flexible mechanism that would aim at a new world balance in which the \r\ndeveloping countries of the world should have an effective role in the \r\nformulation and setting up of a new world order that must replace the rampant \r\ninternational chaos of today, and put an end to the present marginalization of \r\ninternational covenants and agreements which must be binding to us all. The \r\nPresidents and Heads of Government of the Non-Aligned Movement have set for \r\nthemselves anew the target of ensuring a full presence for the Movement in \r\naddressing all the international issues on the world\u0027s agenda. They also have \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n33 \r\n(Mr. Sahloul. Sudan) \r\nset the target of becoming genuine partners in all decisions to be taken \r\nparticularly within the framework of the United Nations and its Security \r\nCouncil. \r\nThe international mechanism governing relations between States should, in \r\nour opinion, continue to be the United Nations and its agencies. However, in \r\norder for this important Organization fully to discharge its duties, the \r\nfollowing must be achieved. \r\nFull commitment and adherence to the United Nations Charter, which must \r\nbe developed in a manner that would be compatible with the changes that have \r\ntaken place in the world since it was signed. \r\nThe General Assembly must be enabled to play a full role in the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security. The General Assembly\u0027s role should be as \r\nimportant as that of the Security Council\u0027s. \r\nSelectivity and double standards must be abandoned with respect to the \r\nimplementation of the Charter\u0027s provisions. \r\nThe Security Council\u0027\", activities should be characterized by \r\ntransparency. The Council should adopt a democratic approach in the area of \r\ndecision-making. \r\nThe United Nations Secretary-General should be able to play his role \r\nfully,. without diktat from certain States, and should deal with all States on \r\nan equal footing. While appreciating the responsibilities of the \r\nSecretary-General, we are if the opinion that he should have the time to meet \r\nthe delegates and representatives of Member States and listen to what they \r\nhave to say on issues of i iportance to their countries and their regions. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n34 \r\n(Mr. Sahloul. Sudan) \r\nThe permanent membership of the Security Council and the right of veto \r\nwhich is the prerogative of the few should be reviewed. It is worh mentioning \r\nin this respect that the veto has been cast 279 times since the inception of \r\nthe Security Council, in relation to issues most of which were of special \r\nimportance to countries of the developing world. \r\nThe new world order being heralded nowadays should not violate the \r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity, or independence of States nor deprive them \r\nof their right to make their own decisions. Preventive diplomacy relating to \r\nthe making and maintenance of peace should proceed from a basic principle \r\naimed, first and foremost, at the complete eradication of regional and \r\ninternational tension, and at seeking out and uprooting the root causes of \r\npolitical, social and economic conflicts so that the countries involved may \r\nlive in peace and enjoy stability and prosperity. \r\nThe type of preventive diplomacy that is accompanied by the use of \r\nmilitary force must not be used against the smaller States alone. It is worth \r\nwondering here how military force can be used against countries which possess \r\nlarge or medium military capabilities. This is a legitimate question and we, \r\nthe smaller States, should look for an answer to it that would meet our urgent \r\nconcerns. If preventive diplomacy is to proceed initially from the principle \r\nof fact-finding, such fact-finding should be based on information-gathering \r\nfrom original sources and should avoid selectivity and hasty conclusions that \r\ncould become the justification for specific actions which may well be military \r\nin nature. We in the developing world have suffered a great deal from the \r\nunfair communication of facts on issues concerning our countries, either \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n35 \r\n(Mr. Sahloul. Sudan) \r\nthrough mass media networks or governmental and non-governmental organizations \r\nwhich may be active in our countries. We hope that the United Nations and its \r\nvarious agencies, in all cases, will act impartially and not fall prey to \r\nnarrow political opportunism. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n36 \r\n(Mr. Sahloul. Sudan) \r\nIn the midst of international changes, we in the Sudan are striving to \r\nspread the principles of Shura meaning consultation and participation in \r\ndecision-making - and democracy, and to find a peaceful and lasting political \r\nsolution to the problem of the southern Sudan. We have so far achieved \r\nconsiderable progress, at the Abuja talks, which took place in May this year \r\nunder the auspices of President Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria. \r\nWe look forward with optimism and hope to the forthcoming second round of \r\nthe Abuja talks, which will soon take place. We expect to reach, with the \r\nrebel movement, a final solution to the problem of the south, by the end of \r\nthis year. It is our sincere hope that the peace efforts by the Sudan \r\nGovernment will attract the support and blessings of all friendly and \r\nfraternal States and of the international community as a whole. \r\nAllow me to mention here specifically, an important issue that weighs a \r\nlot on many minds these days, namely the issue of human rights. The \r\nprotection and maintenance of human rights is a sacred obligation that all \r\nreligions and human laws call for. The causes of instability and problems of \r\nsecurity and peace are directly and organically linked to the maintenance of \r\nthese rights, for individuals and for peoples alike. Therefore, it is our \r\nconviction that human rights are linked to the right of individuals and \r\npeoples to dignity, physical and mental health, the freedom to make their own \r\ndecisions without diktat, the right to have access to the fruits of scientific \r\nadvancement, namely progress and technology, the right to be free from \r\npoverty, disease and hunger and the right to education as well as to material \r\nand psychological stability. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Sahloul. Sudan) \r\nHowever, we notice that the principles of human rights, just like many \r\nother ideals, are being exploited and misused as a pretext for interference \r\nand intervention in the internal affairs of smaller States. Regardless of the \r\nclaims of interference and intervention for the protection of minorities, such \r\nbehaviour is, in essence, no more than using the issue of human rights as a \r\nweapon against those countries which do not submit to foreign diktat, and as a \r\nmeans of shrugging off moral obligations towards the developing countries. \r\nWe also notice that while the lofty ideal of human rights is being \r\nwielded as weapon, its use is characterized by a double-standard. The crimes \r\nand violations by allies are ignored, while accusations of human rights \r\nviolations are trumped up against those countries that do not surrender their \r\nright to independent decision-making. \r\nWe notice too that certain countries have set themselves up as the \r\nself-styled protectors of human rights even though they lack any moral grounds \r\nthat may gualify them for such a role. Such States give themselves the right \r\nto dictate norms of human rights according to their own cultures, customs and \r\nsocial conceptions, and pass judgement on others accordingly. \r\nThe promotion of human rights and basic freedoms will be properly \r\nachieved, as envisaged by those who wrote the United Nations Charter, only \r\nthrough international cooperation and not through confrontation or coercion. \r\nThe upholding and implementation of those rights within national frameworks \r\nremain within the jurisdiction and responsibility of each Government \r\nindividually so long as that Government properly performs its duties towards \r\nits citizens. It is the right of all peoples to freely establish their own \r\npolitical and economic systems and institutions on the basis of respect for \r\nthe principles of national sovereignty, self-determination and \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of others. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n38 \r\n(Mr. Sahloul. Sudan) \r\nIn this context, reference should be made to the fact that the \r\nfundamental principles of human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights embody two components that balance out each other: the first \r\nrelates to the rights and basic freedoms of the individual, while the second \r\nstipulates duties of the individual towards society and State. \r\nThis balance between rights and duties is important, inasmuch as its \r\nabsence leads to the negation of the rights of society as a whole and to \r\ninstability, especially in developing countries. We agree also with the view \r\nthat the political, civil, economic, social and cultural dimensions of human \r\nrights are indivisible, and cannot be selectively denied for contingent \r\npolitical motives. \r\nAt the same time, we reject every attempt to use the human rights issue \r\nas a precondition for the provision of economic and social assistance as this \r\nleads to the marginalization of such rights on the economic, social and \r\ncultural levels. We emphasize that development and human rights are \r\nconcomitant and interdependent. Hence the need for cooperation and \r\nmultilateral assistance in the implementation of social and economic \r\ndevelopment programmes in the developing countries on the basis of the fact \r\nthat the right to development is a valid, legitimate right that constitutes an \r\nindivisible part of fundamental human rights. We hope that the World \r\nConference on Human Rights that will be held next year will deal \r\ncomprehensively with the issue in all its aspects. \r\nAnother important issue that requires urgent attention is the situation \r\nin Somalia. The people of this sister country are victims of a bitter civil \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n39 \r\n(Mr. Sahloul. Sudan) \r\nThey have suffered its ravages. Since the convening of the minisummit of \r\nthe States of the Horn of Africa on humanitarian issues, those States have \r\nperformed and continue to perform their duty in searching for a peaceful \r\nsolution to the differences between the warring factions in the dispute in \r\nSomalia. \r\nWe look forward to the support of the international community for that \r\nrole in order for it to achieve the goals spelled out at the Bahr Dar \r\nmeeting. We had expected the international community to recognize that role \r\nand develop it, as stability in the region is important, especially to its \r\ncountries and for the welfare of its peoples which cannot be ensured without \r\nthis desired stability. \r\nHowever, what happened instead was that a decision to send international \r\nforces to Somalia was taken, and the numbers of those forces have started to \r\nincrease from one day to the next. It was our opinion that such forces should \r\nhave been composed of contingents from the countries of the region itself, \r\nbecause we are worried that some countries from outside the region may pursue \r\ntheir own interests there by supporting one faction or another against the \r\nothers and thereby enabling it to win the war. Stability in Somalia cannot be \r\nachieved without comprehensive national reconciliation; one faction cannot \r\nhave sole power, and we hope that the faction of Mr. Ali Mahdi will come to \r\nrealize this fact. \r\nSeveral tragic multifaceted situations continue to beset the world such \r\nas the refugee problems and the plight of displaced and homeless persons. \r\nThese problems are clearly manifest in Africa and the Middle East. \r\nThe Palestinian people continue to struggle and strive for the \r\nestablishment of their own independent State on their own soil at a time when \r\nbilateral and multilateral negotiations are being obstructed by procedural \r\n\\ _ \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n40 \r\n(Mr. Sahloul. Sudan) \r\nhurdles that have held back those talks and prevented the negotiators from \r\naddressing the substance of the conflict. The nev; Israeli Government has not \r\nyet proved its serious intent or demonstrated the political will to restore \r\nthe rights of the Palestinian people and consequently restore peace and \r\nsecurity to this sensitive region of the world. We consider that the \r\nconvening of an international conference on the Palestinian question under \r\nfull United Nations supervision is the only viable alternative. \r\nWe further believe that the attempts being made with the aim of \r\nfragmenting the territorial integrity of Iraq are negative acts and examples \r\nof the unjust improper application of international norms. Moreover, those \r\nattempts will eventually jeopardize the balance of power in the region, ensure \r\nabsolute Israeli hegemony and open wide the doors to Israel\u0027s belligerent and \r\nexpansionist intentions which aim at ingathering all the Jews of the world in \r\na greater Israel. \r\nAnother human tragedy that needs close attention is the question of the \r\nMuslim people of Bosnia and Herzegovina who are being subjected to genocide \r\nand liquidation under the very noses of those who call for the preservation of \r\nhuman rights and the protection of minorities. This situation, in our view, \r\nis the result of ancient and anachronistic ethnic and religious hatreds which \r\nshould have disappeared by now. All countries agree that the massacres, \r\ngenocide, detentions and summary executions that are taking place there have \r\nno precedent other than what took place in the days of the Second World War. \r\nWhile the changes that swept over the countries of Eastern Europe have \r\nresulted in the emergence of new republics, we would have hoped that, in due \r\ncourse, those republics were going to join the world community of independent \r\nStates and ensure the enjoyment to the full, by a\u0027l their peoples, of \r\nreligious and cultural freedoms. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n41 \r\n(Mr. Sahloul. Sudan) \r\nThe appeasement of a belligerent majority is a clear case of bias in \r\nfavour of the creed and cultural affiliations of that majority as opposed to \r\nthe Islamic faith of a considerable number of the peoples of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina. The actual handling of this issue has been flawed by the \r\nselectivity of the major Powers, especially the five permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council. It is definitely short-sighted to deal with the problem \r\nonly from a limited humanitarian perspective. What the people of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina need above all is the preservation of their identity side by side \r\nwith freedom and protection from acts of displacement and extermination. We \r\ntherefore consider that the resolutions of the Security Council on this issue \r\nare inadequate because they do not address the issue in its wider political \r\nand ethical context. Proceeding from this view, the Islamic Group has \r\ncondemned Security Council resolution 770 (1992). \r\nIn our opinion, complete military intervention by the United Nations is \r\nthe only viable solution. If this does not take place, our nagging doubts \r\nthat there is a scheme to erase the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina from \r\nthe map of Europe will only grow. In addition, the policy of depriving the \r\npeople of Bosnia and Herzegovina of the means to defend their very existence \r\nwhile the Serbian aggressors continue to receive arms without any interference \r\nfrom the United Nations, will cast strong doubts on the integrity and \r\nneutrality of the international Organization. \r\nRecently, a minor crisis has flared up between the two sisterly States of \r\nIran and the United, Arab Emirates over certain disputed islands. We are \r\ndisturbed by the fact that that dispute has been transferred from the \r\nbilateral context to regional and international forums. This will only \r\nexacerbate the conflict. The parties that are now engaged in promoting the \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Sahloul. Sudan) \r\nescalation of that dispute especially in the mass media, are trying, in fact, \r\nto aggravate tensions in the Gulf region, which has suffered the unfortunate \r\neffects of the sad events that have swept over it during the past few years. \r\nWe urge most strongly the containment of this dispute which should be \r\naddressed at the bilateral level in line with the operation of the old \r\nmechanism that was agreed upon in 1971 between the two parties. \r\nThe Persian Gulf area has suffered a series of wars that have obstructed \r\nits development. The present agonies of the people of Iraq under the \r\nconditions of an unjust economic blockade and the unending attempts to \r\nfragment their country\u0027s tarritorial integrity have resulted from disputes \r\nwhich, in our view, should have been settled by peaceful means within the \r\nregional framework, in order to prevent foreign interests from infiltrating \r\nthe region and capitalizing on differences and disputes to serve their own \r\nstrategic and economic designs. \r\nThe international economic situation remains static. Indeed, its \r\nprincipal feature continues to be the unending deterioration of the economies \r\nof the countries of the South and the widening gap between those countries and \r\nthe industrial countries. The major cause of that deterioration lies in the \r\nnegative and dangerous effects on international trade of the drop in exports \r\nof the developing countries as a result of the deterioration of prices of \r\ntheir primary commodity exports to the industrial countries. \r\nThe horrendous negative effects of the debt crisis have been aggravated \r\nto the point where they not only threaten the prospects of economic and social \r\ndevelopment of the developing countries but also the very existence of those \r\ncountries. \r\nIt is important at this point to mention the failure of the industrial \r\ncountries to honour their commitments, as embodied in international treaties \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n43 \r\n(Mr. Sahloul, Sudan) \r\nand strategies pertaining to the flow of development assistance to the \r\ndeveloping countries, and particularly in implementing the resolutions \r\nembodied in the the international strategy for the decade of the 1980s, which \r\ncalled for allocating 0.7% of their gross national income to official \r\nassistance to the developing countries. Instead of implementing those \r\nresolutions, the developed countries have blocked every attempt to adopt a new \r\nstrategy for the decade of the 1990s. Furthermore, the industrial countries \r\nhave failed to implement the programme for the 1990s, which was adopted in \r\nfavour of the least developed countries in the 1990 Paris Conference. This. \r\nfailure has caused a grave setback to the economic and social development of \r\nthe least developed countries. \r\nAfrica, with its feeble infrastructures, is the continent that has been \r\nmost affected by that imbalance in the world economic situation. It is the \r\ncontinent that suffers most, because of the considerably diminished flow of \r\neconomic assistance and investment and the imposition on its countries of \r\nunjust conditions that are not imposed upon the other groupings of the \r\ndeveloping world. Moreover, the attempts to destabilize some regions of the \r\ncontinent aim, in our view.- at creating a geopolitical climate that would be \r\ncompatible with the strategies of certain major Powers. We all know the \r\npotentials of Africa, a continent with a great wealth of untapped human and \r\nnatural resources. \r\nThe real challenge that now faces the international community is \r\nnarrowing of the ever-widening gap between the wealthy countries of the North \r\nand the poor countries of the South. It is that gap which is the real threat \r\nto world peace and security. The debt crisis is one of the products of the \r\npresent international economic order. It is a phenomenon that resulted. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n44-45 \r\n(Mr. Sahloul. Sudan) \r\nessentially, from the structural imbalance of that order, and its failure to \r\ngenerate an appropriate developmental climate. \r\nWe have an unshakable belief in the necessary collective interdependency \r\nand the organic interrelatedness of the international economic order, if it is \r\nto be an order whose aim is to mutually benefit all mankind. This cannot be \r\nthe case, however, unless comprehensive and integrated solutions are found to \r\nthe existing problems on the basis of equality, justice and interdependency. \r\nThe dialogue required for the achievement of that objective cannot take place \r\nwithout the political will, courage, wisdom and far-sightedness of all \r\nconcerned. \r\nIn conclusion, we should like to express our absolute conviction \r\nregarding the necessity of collective action in the current period of detente \r\nin international relations. That means, in our view, developing the \r\nactivities of all the organs of the United Nations and giving those organs the \r\nrequired importance. In order to reach that objective, we need to cooperate \r\nand work together, hand in hand. \r\nMay Allah lead us to our noble objectives and grant us the vision to see \r\nthem clearly. \r\nADDRESS BY MR. ADRIEN SIBOMANA, PRIME MINISTER OF THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI \r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Burundi. \r\nMr. Adrien Sibomana. ?rime Minister of the Republic of Burundi, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have great pleasure in welcoming the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Burundi, His Excellency Mr. Adrien Sibomana, and \r\ninviting him to address the Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n46 \r\nMr. SIBOMANA (Burundi) (interpretation from French): For me it is a \r\ngreat pleasure and an agreeable duty to participate in the work of the General \r\nAssembly at its forty-seventh session. For almost half a century the United \r\nNations has been working to lead mankind to the more human condition of peace \r\nand international solidarity. \r\nAllow me to take this early opportunity to discharge the duty an honour \r\ngiven to me by Major Pierre Buyoya, President of the Republic of Burundi of \r\nconveying to Mr. Ganev, the President of the General Assembly at its current \r\nsession, a message of peace and solidarity, in keeping with the fundamental \r\npurposes set out in the Charter. Allow me also, on behalf of my delegation, \r\nmy Government and the people of Burundi, to join other representatives in \r\ncongratulating Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency. There is no doubt \r\nthat his distinguished qualities, together with his rich experience, will lead \r\nto the success that everyone expects of our deliberations. \r\nOur congratulations go also to the members of the General Committee, who, \r\nI am sure, will spare no effort to support the President in the discharge of \r\nhis responsibilities. \r\nAt the same time I express our very good wishes to Mr. Ganev\u0027s eminent \r\npredecessor as President, who conducted the work of the General Assembly at \r\nits forth-sixth session with remarkable competence. \r\nFurthermore, I should like to pay a very well deserved tribute to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his determination to see \r\nthat peace and security in the world are preserved. \r\nThe Republic of Burunii warmly welcomes the countries that have just \r\njoined the family of the United Nations. \r\nMankind is going throngh a period of contrasts. Current events are \r\ncharacteristic of the transition from one era to another. Indeed, the world \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Sibomana. Burundi) \r\ngives the impression that it is seeking a new balance, which, we hope, will \r\nenable men and women to live together more harmoniously. Whereas the ending \r\nof the cold war and the remarkable disarmament efforts have resulted in \r\nsignificant progress in the field of international security, bloody conflicts \r\ncontinue to tear the planet apart. \r\nWhile a series of events, of which everyone is aware, is persuading \r\npeoples to work together to achieve economic and even political integration, \r\nnations are being torn apart by very bloody fratricidal conflicts. One has \r\nonly to consider the extremely worrying situation in Somalia to realize that \r\nthe world is still a theatre for tragedies that one cannot bear to watch. \r\nIn recent years the winds of liberty have been blowing throughout the \r\nworld, and all nations have been rising up in a crusade for human rights and \r\nthe dignity of the human person, yet men and women continue to be deprived of \r\nelementary rights the right to life, the right to a homeland and the right \r\nto development. This is the case in South Africa, where apartheid, even in \r\nits death throes, continues to claim victims, and where people, here and \r\nthere, continue to be deprived of a homeland. \r\nWhile steady scientific progress is enabling mankind to master natural \r\nforces and is preparing him to subdue other planets, men and women continue to \r\nwallow in deprivation. This is especially true of the African continent, \r\nwhere ignorance, hunger and sickness still reign on a grand scale. The \r\npicture so eloquently presented by Abdou Diouf in his capacity as President of \r\nthe Organization of African Unity fully conveys the concerns of Africa and of \r\nAfricans, and we agree completely with what he said. \r\nAt the Rio Conference the international community took a major step in \r\nits awareness of the need to preserve the quality of the environment on Earth, \r\nwhich is our common home. Paradoxically, however, as we seek means of \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n48-50 \r\n(Mr. Sibomana, Burundi) \r\nsubsistence we continue to destroy things that we need to enable us to live \r\nand breathe. This becomes more and more evident when we look at the intimate \r\nrelationship between the environment and development a relationship that the \r\nRio Conference very rightly set out for us. \r\nWe are living in an era of paradox. On one hand, it seems that the world \r\nhas been moving ahead at full speed in terms of peace and security, freedom, \r\nwell-being and progress, but, on the other hand, we are witnessing war, \r\npoverty, hunger and misery. In these conditions mankind has no chance of \r\nmaking progress. Thus the objectives set out in the Charter of the United \r\nNations are still relevant. \r\nIn this the last decade of the twentieth century we must show that we are \r\ndetermined to preserve international peace and security. We must also \r\ndemonstrate greater solidarity, as an injury to the little finger causes \r\nsuffering to the entire body. Like the illustrious founders of this \r\nOrganization, we must proclaim our faith in a better world and must turn the \r\nUnited Nations into an Organization capable of maintaining international peace \r\nand security and of ensuring justice and respect for human rights. \r\nMoreover, the Organization must be able, in accordance with its Charter, \r\nto promote social progress and better standards of life for all peoples of the \r\nworld. The Republic of Burundi therefore pays a tribute to all those who are \r\nstriving daily to maintain peace in the world and welcomes the signs of \r\nsolidarity whereby all peoples may be enabled to live life to the full, in \r\nkeeping with the aspirations and values that underlie the United Nations. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. Sibomana, Burundi) \r\nIn that connection, the report \"An Agenda for Peace\" submitted to the \r\nGeneral Assembly by the Secretary-General deserves the international \r\ncommunity\u0027s close attention. For its part, the Republic of Burundi reiterates \r\nits faith in the United Nations Charter and its commitment to work with the \r\ninternational community in achieving the triumph of its ideals. \r\nThe rostrum of the United Nations, which is provided to us each yoar, is \r\na special place for dialogue and exchanges of views that enable us better to \r\nunderstand one another and share our experiences. Allow me, therefore, \r\nbriefly to share with representatives the principal paths that my country has \r\ndecided to take in rebuilding and making its modest contribution to the \r\nrealization of the Organization\u0027s goals. \r\nIn the not-too-distant past my country went through some tragic \r\nexperiences caused by continuing divisive conflicts, essentially ethnic. They \r\nwere followed by tragedies that resulted in loss of human life and a large \r\nexodus of refugees seeking asylum in neighbouring countries and elsewhere in \r\nthe world. That situation had a serious effect on social relations. Rancour, \r\nmistrust and hatred took root in the hearts of brothers and sisters who should \r\nhave been living together in a single, age-old nation. \r\nIt was in this context an uneasy one, to say the least that on \r\n3 September 1987 the people of Burundi rose up to change the unhappy course of \r\ntheir history. Five years later, I am pleased to announce that Burundi is \r\nonce again a united nation. Indeed, with the proclamation of the Third \r\nRepublic, Burundi has turmd the page and is now embarked upon the \r\nconstruction of a new society of peace, justice and social harmony. Under the \r\ndynamic and farsighted leadership of Major Pierre Buyoya, President of the \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. Sibomana. Burundi) \r\nRepublic, the people of Burundi are in the process of burying once and for all \r\nthe quarrels and divisions from which they have suffered for so long. To \r\nachieve that goal, the Government has based its actions on three fundamental \r\nfactors: national reconciliation, democratization and development. \r\nFirst, the people of Burundi set out to realize internal reconciliation. \r\nTo remove the divisions that had rent the fabric of Burundi society, the \r\npeople determined, with a supreme effort, to pull themselves together and \r\nexperience the forgiveness of national reconciliation. Witness to this is the \r\nproclamation of faith contained in the Charter of National Unity, in which \r\nBurundis, with historic conviction, stated: \r\n\"We are determined to break with the past and to embark upon a new era in \r\norder to build a more promising future free of hatred and mistrust.\" \r\nThe national reconciliation now achieved has been the result of a \r\ncomplete process. The first requirement was to engage in an examination of \r\nconscience, which inspired Burundis to join together and to tell themselves \r\nthe truth. That process began with the establishment of a National Commission \r\nmade up of citizens of all ethnic groups, all regions and all religious and \r\nsocio-professional sectors. The Commission\u0027s task was to diagnose the disease \r\nof division and then to propose appropriate cures. After seven months of \r\narduous work the Commissio.i submitted a report setting forth an analysis of \r\nthe situation and proposals for a better future. \r\nHowever, as President Buyoya has so pertinently said, the construction \r\nand deepening of a people\u0027s unity cannot be accomplished by the President of \r\nthe Republic alone, nor by his Government. Therefore, based on the \r\nCommission\u0027s report, a national debate on the important question of national \r\nunity was organized among ill sectors of society. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Sibomana. Burundi) \r\nIn making such a thorough examination of a subject so long taboo, the \r\npeople of Burundi has discovered the virtues of dialogue and joint effort, \r\nelevated into a form of government. The national debate was crowned with the \r\ncreation of the Charter of National Unity, which was adopted with the support \r\nof more than 89 per cent of the population in a referendum held on \r\n5 February 1991. \r\nSince that time the Charter of National Unity has become the pre-eminent \r\npoint of reference for all of the nation\u0027s political life and a pact by which \r\nall Burundis have sealed an alliance to consolidate their regained unity. \r\nWith the Charter we, the people of Burundi have proclaimed our faith in \r\nlasting national unity and condemned and forever rejected all divisions of any \r\nkind. We have thus committed ourselves to uprooting from our society any \r\ntendency to violence, physical extermination and vengeance. \r\nMore positively, we have committed ourselves to rigorous respect for the \r\nethic of national unity. This is translated into respect for human life, the \r\npromotion of justice and the safeguarding and consolidation of peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\nIn parallel with that process, which was aimed principally at reconciling \r\nhearts and minds, the process of consolidating national unity has been marked \r\nby a series of specific measures undertaken with a concern to administer the \r\nState in keeping with the ethic of national unity. \r\nIn October 1988 the President of the Republic established a new \r\nGovernment called the Government of National Unity, whose composition reflects \r\nthe concern of high-level State authorities to bring all elements of society \r\ninto the management of public affairs. The Government has the political \r\nmission of stimulating a new spirit in all sectors of national life. At every \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n54-55 \r\n(Mr. Sibomana, Burundi) \r\nlevel of society responsibilities have been entrusted to citizens from all \r\nwalks of life, without any discrimination whatsoever. In this undertaking the \r\nGovernment has given pride of place to other values cherished by the Third \r\nRepublic: equality of all citizens, the cult of excellence and total \r\ntransparency in the management of public affairs. \r\nWith national unity regained and national reconcliation an accomplished \r\nfact, we are able give all due attention to grappling with the thorny problem \r\nof refugees. Everyone agrees that the fact that there are so many millions of \r\nrefugees throughout the world is a result of internal or inter-State conflicts \r\nthat Governments have been powerless to resolve. Furthermore, the \r\ninternational community owes a big debt to the refugees, inasmuch as its \r\ninability to manage harmoniously has led to the violation of a basic human \r\nright, the inalienable right to live somewhere in one\u0027s homeland, with no risk \r\nof having no home. \r\nFortified by those convictions, and having laid the foundations for \r\ndomestic peace, the Government of the Republic of Burundi has undertaken a \r\nvast programme of voluntary repatriation for Burundi refugees. It feels that \r\nvoluntary repatriation is by far the best lasting solution to the refugee \r\nquestion. Thus, in carrying out this work of national reconciliation our \r\ncountry\u0027s highest bodies have offered those of our compatriots who have gone \r\ninto exile the opportunity to return freely to their country. In so doing, \r\nour ambition is to see that soon no Burundians will be living with the \r\ndegrading label pf refugee. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n56 \r\n(Mr. Sibomana. Burundi) \r\nFrom this rostrum and before the entire international community, I should \r\nlike to repeat what Major Pierre Buyoya, President of the Republic, said, and \r\nsolemnly reiterate my Government\u0027s appeal to all refugees from Burundi, \r\nwherever they may be, to freely return to their homeland. We shall welcome \r\nthem with open arms. \r\nI am pleased to note at this point that the results already achieved in \r\nthis programme are extremely encouraging. \r\nIn 1988, following the unrest that disrupted peace and security in two of \r\nour communities, we succeeded in repatriating approximately 50,000 people who \r\nhad moved to neighbouring countries. Thanks to the assistance of the \r\ninternational community, we were able without difficulty to set them up again \r\non their own land, to build new homes for them and to help reintegrate them \r\ninto our production networks. \r\nIn that same spirit, my Government is continuing to welcome those of the \r\nrefugees who left their country some 20 years ago that freely choose to return. \r\nEven as we speak, more than 25,000 of them have already returned home, \r\nand others continue to arrive. \r\nThanks to national and international solidarity, those who were \r\nrepatriated have rejoined society in complete dignity. The Government has \r\nmade an inventory of all available lands that could accommodate them, and they \r\nare being given assistance that allows them to meet their needs until they can \r\nsubsist on the fruits of their own labour. In collaboration with local \r\nadministrative authorities, they are receiving all the help necessary to build \r\na decent home, and they even have health insurance so that they can easily \r\nobtain health care. Their children have been integrated into the school \r\nsystem, and those among the repatriated who have some training are receiving \r\nall the help needed to secure a position in the work force. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr..Sibomana. Burundi) \r\nI take this opportunity to thank the countries and the organizations that \r\nhave supported us in carrying out this programme, and we also appeal to the \r\ninternational community to continue to help us in this process, of which my \r\npeople are so proud. \r\nIn sealing this pact of national unity, the people of Burundi placed \r\nspecial emphasis on the absolute need to see to it that the management of the \r\nState is democratically assured. That is why, in keeping with the \r\nconsolidation of national unity, Burundi has undertaken to democratize our \r\ninstitutions. \r\nI would be remiss not to share with the Assembly information about the \r\nsteps that my country has taken. This was for us an original move, and we \r\nhave every reason to be satisfied with it. Indeed, in this process as well as \r\nin the one that led to national reconciliation, the Government has always been \r\ncareful to involve all segments of the population. Through frank and sincere \r\ndialogue with the people, the political class has always been honest and wise \r\nenough to put itself in the hands of the people, being convinced that no work \r\ncan last unless the citizens are involved, for in the final analysis they are \r\nthe ones who do the work and who benefit from all changes. \r\nThus, throughout all of last year the people were closely involved with \r\ndrawing up a new constitution, which was subsequently adopted by referendum on \r\n9 March 1992 by more than 90 per cent of the population. The new constitution \r\nestablishes a multiparty system and gives special attention to respect for \r\nfundamental human rights. \r\nIn this way, Burundi has put an end to 26 years of a single-party system \r\nand has restored order, serenity and national harmony. Since that time, the \r\nGovernment has worked to implement the guidelines contained in the \r\nconstitution. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr. Sibomana. Burundi) \r\nThe process of effectively implementing pluralism was accelerated in such \r\na way that today, seven political parties are already on the political scene. \r\nAppropriate legislation was also passed promptly to promote the right to free \r\nassociation and freedom of the press, which are indispensable foundations for \r\na vital multiparty system. \r\nIn terms of human rights, independent leagues have been established. In \r\nthis particular area, which is very dear to us, we have just established a \r\ncentre for the promotion of human rights whose mission is to instil into \r\nsociety, through teaching and various means of communication, the values that \r\nunderlie respect for human dignity. \r\nIn Burundi, the democratization of our institutions is therefore \r\nproceeding in this manner, and the Government is strongly determined to keep \r\nmoving forward. That is why, in keeping with the guidelines that the \r\nPresident has already laid down, the Government is planning to hold general \r\nelections in the early months of 1993. Once the constitution has clearly \r\ndefined the institutional structure that is to guide the country and the \r\ncompeting partners, that is, the political parties, are on the scene, we \r\nbelieve that it would be a reprehensible step backwards to prolong this period \r\nof transition indefinitely. \r\nOur intention is to give to a sovereign people the opportunity to speak, \r\nso that they can democratically elect the leaders of their choice. We do so \r\nin what we term the Burundi way, that is to say in complete openness, through \r\ndialogue and joint efforts. \r\nI should not like to take advantage of your kind attention. Sir. None \r\nthe less, I should be remiss if, before ending my statement, I did not mention \r\nwhat we consider to be a pillar of unity and democracy that is, development. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n59 \r\n(Mr.•Sibomana. Burundi) \r\nI should not like to take advantage of your kind attention. Sir. None \r\nthe less, I should be remiss if, before ending my statement, I did not mention \r\nwhat we consider to be a pillar of unity and democracy that is, \r\ndevelopment. Speaking of national unity, we say that unity and development \r\nare inseparable realities and that it would be difficult to achieve one \r\nwithout the other. The same is true of democracy. Indeed, without enjoying \r\nthe public freedoms that are the structure of true democracy, people cannot \r\nfully express their creativity. Similarly, democratic freedoms that are not \r\nbased on the satisfaction of elementary human needs would only be wishful \r\nthinking and would rapidly become void of any substance. \r\nFollowing these principles, the Government has undertaken a series of \r\nprogrammes of action for development. For a country such as ours, development \r\nis not a difficult concept to define. Essentially, it boils down to \r\nsatisfying the basic needs of the population, such as drinking water, health \r\nservices, schooling for their children, decent homes and also food security. \r\nTo succeed in this development enterprise, the authorities of the third \r\nRepublic initiated a structural adjustment programme with the support of the \r\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Implementation of the \r\nprogramme is intended to stabilize the finances of our country and to \r\ntransform our productive structures with a view to achieving economic growth. \r\nThis reform, moreover, is guided by the principles of good management of \r\npublic affairs and of liberalizing the economy. \r\nIn so doing, important efforts have been made to promote the private \r\nsector. This new manner of conducting development emphasizes the growing \r\ndisengagement of the State and the giving of responsibility to individuals and \r\ncorporations. In this framework, the Government has, since 1991, embarked \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n60 \r\n(Mr, sihnmana. Burundi) \r\non a major economic programme to privatize public enterprises. What is \r\ninvolved is the partial or total opening up of public enterprises to private \r\ncapital. It also involves restructuring those enterprises that need it in \r\norder to be more profitable and to establish more effective mechanisms for \r\nmanaging them. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n61 \r\n(Mr.•Sibomana. Burundi) \r\nThe liberalization of Burundi\u0027s economy has just entered a new stage with \r\nthe creation of a free trade zone regime. This reform, intended to promote \r\ninvestment in order to bring about the diversification of our exports, grants \r\ntax and other advantages which some consider to be among the most advantageous \r\nin the world. \r\nInvestors who so desire can come and work with us. I can guarantee that \r\nthey will not regret doing so. The political reforms that have taken place \r\nwithin the framework of strengthening national unity and of democratization of \r\ninstitutions have created in our country a political and social environment \r\nwhich is very favourable to business. \r\nI have given a thumbnail sketch of the situation in Burundi today. As I \r\nindicated at the beginning of my statement, the Government and people of \r\nBurundi are working to achieve national reconciliation. The steps we have \r\ntaken allow us to welcome our brothers and sister who were refugees and enable \r\nthem to regain their dignity by returning freely to their homeland. Thanks to \r\nthe national unity we have regained, the democratization of our institutions \r\nis also taking place in an atmosphere of peace, order and serenity. We have \r\ncommitted ourselves to ambitious development programmes in order to establish \r\nan environment and a social infrastructure that can support social peace. \r\nIn this way, in full cooperation with the international community, \r\nBurundi feels that it is 01 the right path, one which will allow it, moreover, \r\nto make its contribution t) building a better world of peace, security and \r\ninternational solidarity. This is the best inheritance we could leave to our \r\nchildren. \r\nHow could we not in chis United Nations body give some thought to the \r\nchildren, who are the future of us all? This is why we wish especially to \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Sibomana. Burundi) \r\nrecall that today, 30 September 1992, marks the second anniversary of the \r\nWorld Summit for Children. We express to the Secretary-General our \r\nappreciation for the report (A/47/264) he has just submitted to us on the \r\nfollow-up to the Summit. It deserves our attention. \r\nWe should also like to take this opportunity to say that we have high \r\nhopes that the forthcoming conference on this subject, which is to take place \r\nin Dakar, Senegal, next November will study the issue of the future of \r\nAfrica\u0027s children. \r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): On behalf of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the Republic of Rwandi \r\nfor the important statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Adrien Sibomana. Prime Minister of the Republic of Burundi, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\nMr. OCHOA ANTICH (Venezuela) (interpretation from Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of Venezuela, I congratulate our President and the Government and \r\npeople of Bulgaria on his election to preside over this session of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\nI welcome the new Member States, whose presence among us makes this \r\nOrganization more universal. \r\nI also wish to place on record our gratitude to the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Saudi Arabia, Ambassador Samir Shihabi, who presided over \r\nthe work of the forty-sixt\u0027i session with such distinction. \r\nWe are meeting at a time of particular instability and uncertainty. The \r\ninternational system is trying to find a new order and basic principles and \r\nguidelines to enable us to build a more just and egalitarian world. We are \r\nliving at a time of rapid historical change. The most dramatic events and the \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. Ochoa Antich. Venezuela) \r\nmost unexpected changes are taking place before a seemingly helpless world \r\nleadership. \r\nThe end of communism is already a thing of the past; the collapse of the \r\nSoviet empire is ancient history. The absolute triumph of the West is \r\nbeginning to be questioned, given the financial and exchange rate problems \r\nwhich the industrialized countries are experiencing, together with their \r\nprofound social crisis. We might be talking about a post-capitalist era in \r\nwhich the quest for supposedly free competition has turned into a total \r\ndehumanization of the economic model, producing a yawning gap between rich and \r\npoor in world society. \r\nWe are facing not the end of history, but rather a great lack of \r\nleadership, of confidence md of enthusiasm for the future. The \r\nindustrialized countries, bogged down in their economic rivalries, cannot \r\ncoordinate their actions in favour of peace, stability and justice. Deprived \r\nof the enemy which used to make them act together, they are now experiencing a \r\nsubstantial weakening of the bonds which used to unite them. \r\nThe times in which we live require strong, democratic international \r\norganizations if the preventive diplomacy the Secretary-General has described \r\nin his \"Agenda for Peace\" which we are studying very carefully is to take \r\nroot. We support the more active role he envisages for the Organization, in \r\nthe area not of intervention, but rather of prevention. To achieve this, the \r\nUnited Nations and the specialized agencies must cooperate \r\n\"to address the deepest causes of conflict: economic despair, social \r\ninjustice and political oppression.\" (A/47/277, para. 15) \r\nThe Security Council, which should have been the most efficient United \r\nNations body, is an anachronism. It still reflects the interrelationship of \r\nforces that existed when it was created. When the United Nations came into \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n64-65 \r\n(Mr. Ochoa Antich. Venezuela) \r\nbeing, its keystone was the Council, controlled by its five permanent members, \r\nwhich was given predominance to try to eliminate the limitations which had \r\nmade the former League of Nations ineffectual. The founders of the \r\nOrganization thought that this time the big Powers would be able to exercise \r\neffective leadership, in keeping with their power; that is, they would have \r\nthe ability to act as world monitors and arbitrators and bring order to the \r\nworld. \r\nTo the frustration of humanity, the two super-Powers proved that they \r\nalone were enough to lay the foundations of international order. The Security \r\nCouncil, from the day the Organization was established until the end of the \r\ncold war, was to play second fiddle in the management of world affairs. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n66 \r\n(Mr. Ochoa Antich. Venezuela) \r\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet system, the Security Council began to \r\nregain its original functions. But it is doing so under the aegis of the \r\ntriumphant values. Thus the major countries can outline an international \r\nscenario in accordance with their interests. This situation should be \r\nreconsidered so that, as the Secretary-General has said: \r\n\"Democracy within the family of nations means the application of its \r\nprinciples within the world Organization itself.\" (A/47/277, para. 82) \r\nBefore the General Assembly, the President of Venezuela, \r\nCarlos Andres Perez, clearly conveyed his concern over the need to make the \r\nSecurity Council more representative. He said: \r\n\"Our own people\u0027s aspiration to democracy can also become a \r\npermanent aspiration of the United Nations. The Organization will not be \r\nstrengthened unless an agreement is reached to eliminate the right of \r\nveto exercised by the permanent members of the Security Council, a right \r\nthat responded to circumstances and realities that have ceased to exist. \r\nThis mechanism runs counter to the spirit of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and limits its effective contributions to collective security. \r\n\"The right to veto Security Council resolutions is a mechanism that \r\nlimits the achievement of consensus among the Member States of the United \r\nNations. The Security Council must be a representative body, and in no \r\nway should any of its members negate the majority view of the United \r\nNations. If we want collective and democratic security, we must aspire \r\nto universal egalitarian law.\" (A/46/PV.8. p. 13) \r\nIn our changing times, concepts of State sovereignty and integrity are \r\nalso being re-examined. Paradoxically, the \"champions of freedom\", once \r\nvictorious, are trying to :.mpose a homogeneous and intolerant world order in \r\nwhich an independent protagonist would be seen as a destabilizing and \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n67 \r\n(Mr. Ochoa Antich. Venezuela) \r\nthreatening factor. This is a matter of serious concern to the States of the \r\nsouthern hemisphere. In the past, we were important to the North in two \r\nways: as the natural scenario for the East-West confrontation and as \r\nessential suppliers of raw materials. \r\nThe confrontation between East and West is gone and with it the political \r\nand strategic usefulness of the third world. Raw materials have become \r\nmarginal in the present world economy. The slump in the demand for \r\ncommodities becomes more acute with every passing year. The phrase \r\n\"mobilizing effect\" used to mean that any surge in the rich economies would \r\ncarry the developing economies along with it. When the North was growing, so \r\nwere exports of raw materials. The situation has completely changed \r\ntraditional export commodities no longer have the same value. International \r\nmarkets can almost do without us. \r\nThe only way to preserve peace is to find balanced links between the \r\nhemispheres, put an end to relations of confrontation and strengthen \r\ncooperation between peoples. I have not come here to point out the mistakes \r\nmade by the North. The countries in the South also bear heavy \r\nresponsibilities. We must meet our challenge. The era of demagogic populism, \r\ninefficiency and corruption is over. If we wish to compete in a world of open \r\nmarkets we must devote ourselves to productive work and reward creativity. \r\nVenezuela has realized this and is in a position from which it can look to the \r\nfuture with optimism, provided there is compliance with the rules of open \r\nmarkets and competitiveness between nations. \r\nHowever, we must emphasize that while large regions in the South, \r\nespecially in Latin America, are striving to internationalize their economies \r\nby opening them up to competition, the North is increasingly locking itself \r\ninto inward-turning blocs. Ultimately, the free market one of the triumphant \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n68 \r\n(Mr. Ochoa Antich. Venezuela) \r\nvalues to which I have already referred would seem to work in a single \r\ndirection. \r\nIf the rigid attitude of some international financial institutions \r\npersists, together wth the dangerous protectionism that is again emerging \r\namong the industrialized countries, then the 1990s, which in Latin America \r\nbegan with severe economic measures and hopeful signs of growth, may also turn \r\nout to be another lost decade. \r\nThe North is not making a contribution to the establishment of the \r\nnecessary economic links between the two hemispheres. The new world order \r\nimplies a dual concept: on the one hand, the failure of the South and, on the \r\nother, the defeat of the communist East. The power logic being applied is \r\nsimple and direct. There is no longer any question of the loss of any given \r\nstrategic resource or strategic position falling into the hands of communism. \r\nThere being no enemies, there is no longer any danger of losing friends; worse \r\nyet, there is no longer any need for friends. What is important now is that \r\nthere be no disorder and no anarchy. What matters now is the willingness of \r\nthe South to submit to certain global rules of the game as defined by the \r\nNorth in terms of its own interests. \r\nYet they fail to understand that these rules of the game become \r\ninoperative in situations -\u003ef anarchy and civil strife, which can dismember a \r\nState and have spill-over effects on those surrounding it. Somalia is a \r\ntragic example of what the southern hemisphere could become, on a larger \r\nscale, in the twenty-first century. Some wealthy States may feel that they \r\ncan live unaffected by such realities. They are mistaken. We must not forget \r\nthat the South has its own ability to make an instinctive response: the \r\nmigratory flows of its impoverished masses to the North. This flow, which is \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n69-70 \r\n(Mr. Ochoa Antich. Venezuela) \r\nalways difficult for any Government to control, could come to undermine the \r\nbases for the democratic and social stability in many developed countries. \r\nThe best proof of this is the resurgence of extreme rightist movements and the \r\noutbreak of racial violence and xenophobia in many countries. \r\nThese problems and the persistent imbalance between the North and the \r\nSouth highlight a series of essential issues that the Assembly should \r\nconsider. The first is the democratization of the decision-making processes \r\nin the Security Council. This implies a new debate on the veto procedure and \r\nan increase in the number of permanent members so as to allow for the \r\nrepresentation of the new world realities. \r\nA/47/PV.18 \r\n71 \r\n(Mr. Ochoa Antich. Venezuela) \r\nThe new circumstances in the world have been conducive to solving various \r\nregional problems, such as those in Angola, Namibia, Central America, \r\nMozambique and Cambodia; to a large extent, in other areas, such as \r\nAfghanistan, Western Sahara, South Africa and the Middle East, there are \r\nsigns, because of the new circumstances, that warrant hope for negotiated \r\nsolutions to conflicts. Venezuela supports measures designed to achieve \r\npeaceful solutions to these problems and hopes that the favourable \r\ninternational climate will help maintain peace. \r\nWe also supported the Rio summit on the environment and hope that the \r\ndecisions adopted there, particularly those related to the problem of \r\nfinancing Agenda 21, will be implemented as soon as circumstances permit. \u0027 \r\nSimilarly, we give our full support to the Second World Conference on Human \r\nRights, to be held next year, as well as to the forthcoming conferences on \r\npopulation and on the status of women and to the summit on social development. \r\nDespite the endeavours of the United Nations, the outlook is not \r\nencouraging. None the less, when all the countries gathered here in the \r\nAssembly commit themselves to working for change, for a world where hunger and \r\nwar have vanished, where the environment is protected, and where realistic \r\nmeasures are adopted to prevent conflicts, then we shall be building the just \r\nsociety of which we have always dreamed. \r\nTh-i meeting rose at 12.45 p.m. \r\n"
