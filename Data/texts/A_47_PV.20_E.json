We are confident that your ability, political \r\nexperience and diplomatic skills will enable you to guide this session to its \r\ndesired goals. \r\nWe should like to extend our thanks also to your predecessor. \r\nAmbassador Samir Shihabi, the Ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for \r\nthe judicious manner in which he conducted the work of the past session. \r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to extend to \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali our warmest congratulations on the occasion of his \r\nelection to the post of Secretary-General of our Organization. We should like \r\nto pay tribute to his efficiency and the positive results he has been able to \r\nachieve in the short period he has spent in office. I should like to reaffirm \r\nto him our full readiness to work with him in any way that would contribute to \r\nthe performance of his tasks. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n6 \r\n(Mr. Quid Moine. Mauritania) \r\nAt a time when the universal character of our Organization becomes more \r\nand more pronounced through the accession of new States to its membership, I \r\ncannot but seize this opportunity to extend to those new Members our \r\ncongratulations on their accession and, in welcoming them, express our \r\nconfidence that they will be a new tributary of strength to this Organization. \r\nThe year 1992 will always be a landmark on the road to a new type of \r\ndialogue-and-cooperation-oriented international relations. This is attested \r\nto by the high-level international meetings that have been held, and which \r\nhave contributed to the emergence of new patterns of international relations. \r\nExamples of such meetings were the first summit of the members of the Security \r\nCouncil, the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the Summit of the Organization of \r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) in Dakar, and the tenth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nin Djakarta. \r\nAt the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, it became clear to all that it is \r\nno longer acceptable that islands of wealth should persist in an ocean of \r\npoverty and that international problems cannot be solved in the absence of \r\nsincere and effective cooperation between all peoples. \r\nIn these international conditions of rapid change, the causes of \r\ndemocracy and human rights have undergone a marked development and the idea of \r\nlinking social progress to economic development has gained more acceptance. \r\nThis proves that no country or group of countries, no matter how powerful, can \r\nface up to the challenges of the age on its own, without extensive cooperation \r\nand consultation. \r\nHowever, the concept of cooperation and consultation, between countries, \r\neven if it has gained acceptance in theory, has yet to be translated into \r\nactual reality. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n7 \r\n(Mr. Quid Moine. Mauritania) \r\nIn this context, the Rio de Janeiro Conference was a promising start. \r\nThe decision of the Earth Summit to hold negotiations with the aim of \r\ndeveloping an international convention on the phenomenon of drought and \r\ndesertification is cause for optimism. It is regrettable, however, that this \r\nnatural disaster has been allocated the smallest share of the resources \r\nearmarked for the implementation of the environmental programme. \r\nMauritania, in which the bane of drought and desertification has become a \r\nchronic affliction, has formulated a. programme of its own for combating \r\ndesertification and correcting the imbalance in its environment. \r\nProceeding from our experience in this area, we appreciate the \r\ndifficulties of the countries which suffer from this phenomenon. I should \r\nlike, on this occasion, to declare our solidarity with the peoples of southern \r\nregions of Africa and the Horn of Africa who are now suffering the effects of \r\ndrought. \r\nWith the ending of the cold war and its ideological conflicts, today\u0027s \r\nworld faces no greater challenge than that of development. In past decades, \r\nthe traditional current pattern of development proved to be deficient and \r\nincapable of achieving its goals. It is generally accepted now that \r\nalleviating poverty and even attaining a measure of economic well-being are no \r\nlonger sufficient to satisfy the ambitions of mankind for progress. The \r\nsocial dimension of the question of development is vital for the happiness of \r\nmankind. This has proved to be true to such an extent that the advocates of \r\nabsolute liberalism have come to concede that no economic progress can be \r\nachieved in the absence of a social chapter that would complement it. \r\nHence the hope we attach to the planned world summit on social \r\ndevelopment, as such a meeting would highlight the need to link the economic \r\nand the social in development. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n8 \r\n(Mr. Quid Moine. Mauritania) \r\nThe world economic situation still causes concern. The most telling \r\nproof of this is that the developing countries, particularly in Africa, still \r\nface frustrating international conditions that are downright harmful, such as \r\nprotectionism and the burden of foreign debt. \r\nThe economies of developing countries are continuously deteriorating and \r\npoverty is increasing and spreading. Unless something is done to combat this \r\nsituation, it will become impossible to build a world where stability reigns. \r\nHow can we talk about a new world order while nothing concrete is done to \r\neliminate hunger, disease and ignorance? Was it not declared in the \r\nresolutions of the first summit of the member States of the Security Council \r\nthat peace and prosperity are complementary and that no lasting stability can \r\nbe achieved without real international cooperation to eliminate poverty and to \r\nachieve a better life for all? \r\nAnd yet, there is a better chance for international cooperation because \r\nof the increasing practice of democracy in the world and increasing economic \r\nliberalism world wide. In such a context, the United Nations can play a \r\nprincipal role, as it is the ideal forum wherein international questions can \r\nbe addressed, as best exemplified by the special session of the General \r\nAssembly in 1990 and the Rio de Janeiro summit. Those two gatherings have \r\ndemonstrated that it is possible for us to conduct a dialogue between North \r\nand South and thereby to create a climate that is conducive to the promotion \r\nof development. \r\nThe reorganization of the United Nations Secretariat will be an \r\nopportunity to take into account the interests of the majority of the \r\ninhabitants of the planet who face the challenge of development, and who bear \r\nthe burden of its attendant fierce struggle against backwardness, ignorance \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n9-10 \r\n(Mr. Quid Moine. Mauritania) \r\nand disease. In such a context, special attention should be paid to Africa. \r\nAfrica is the continent that exerts strenuous efforts in facing up to the \r\nravages of natural disasters and, at the same time, in coping with the adverse \r\nand frustrating international conditions that stifle its growth, such as a \r\nforeign debt that now exceeds US$ 225 billion. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n11 \r\n(Mr. Quid Moine. Mauritania) \r\nIt has to cope with all this under the crushing impact of the increasing \r\ndepletion of its sources of foreign investment. Therefore, we should provide \r\neffective support to implement the United Nations Convention on the \r\ndevelopment of Africa in the 1990s. The political support for the Convention \r\nthat was announced by the latest summit in Dakar was a first step in that \r\ndirection. \r\nFortunately, the world now witnesses marked progress in the observance of \r\nhuman rights. However, and regrettably, there are still dark corners where \r\nthe darkness has not been pierced yet by the ray of light of freedom and \r\ntolerance. How else could we explain what is taking place today in Bosnia? \r\nHow else could we explain the massacres, the destruction of property, the \r\nhumiliation, and the desecration of sacred shrines? Can there be any hope of \r\nputting an end to this tragedy without more pressure on Serbia by every \r\navailable legitimate means to force it to comply with the will of the \r\ninternational community? Is it not high time for the international community \r\nto put an end to the threats to peace and the violations of basic human rights \r\nin all the world\u0027s hotbeds of tension? \r\nThe World Conference on Human Rights scheduled for next year should \r\nprovide convincing answers to such questions. For our part, we shall hold on \r\nto our conviction that the best possible way to ensure respect for human \r\nrights is to consider them as universal standards that must be applied in all \r\ncases, to all, without distinction. In other words, we should not confine \r\nourselves to condemning repressive practices whenever this serves our \r\ninterests and purposes. We sincerely hope that the future Vienna summit will \r\nsucceed in affirming the purely humane nature of human rights as far away as \r\npossible from political or ideological considerations. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n12 \r\n(Mr. Quid Moine. Mauritania) \r\nWhile we are concerned about the world economic situation and its effects \r\non international relations at the present time, we are hopeful that the \r\nincreasing development of democratic practices will lead to more harmonious \r\nrelations between countries. Mauritanians feel proud of their country\u0027s \r\ncontribution in this respect. \r\nThe democratic process which was launched by the Correction Movement on \r\n12 December 1984, has culminated, this year, in the holding of presidential \r\nand legislative assembly elections within a context of political pluralism. \r\nThe gradualist approach adopted in achieving this has proved to be the best \r\nway of avoiding the shocks of sudden change. Municipal elections, in various \r\nstages, gave the citizen the necessary lessons and sufficient experience to \r\nacquire a spirit of tolerance, and also tested the electoral machinery. \r\nThe Mauritanian people have voted on a constitution embodying a full \r\nmultiparty system for the first time in the history of the country. This \r\nconstitution, which was voted upon and ratified on 12 July 1991, makes \r\nprovision for all the freedoms that are set out in the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights. Consequently, it provides an effective basis for the rule of \r\nlaw under which every citizen will enjoy freedom and justice. In support of \r\nthis qualitative transition, there has been a general amnesty that covered all \r\npolitical crimes and misdemeanours committed since the country became \r\nindependent. We are therefore very happy to state that in our country today \r\nwe do not have a single political prisoner. \r\nWe have passed laws on the freedom of the press and freedom of political \r\nparties and political assembly which have led to the publication of \r\n40 independent newspapers and to the establishment of 16 political parties in \r\naddition to various cultural and scientific organizations. This process has \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n13 \r\n(Mr. Quid Moine. Mauritania) \r\nculminated in three major events: the presidential elections of \r\n24 January 1992; the elections to the House of Representatives on 6 and \r\n13 March; and the Senate elections on 3 and 10 April 1992. \r\nAll these elections took place in an atmosphere of freedom, tolerance and \r\ntransparency which enabled everyone to see everything that was going on and to \r\nmonitor it. That this was the case was confirmed by foreign observers who \r\nmonitored the election process. Indeed, as one of those observers said, the \r\nreal winner of the election race was the Mauritanian people. Mauritanians \r\nhave turned their backs on the experience of single-party and non-democratic \r\nsystems, and have chosen pluralism and real democracy, and, thus, have become \r\nthe source of the authority and legality, as President Mo\u0027awia Ould Sidi Ahmed \r\nal Tayeh remarked in his inaugural address. \r\nOur struggle is not confined to our efforts to develop democracy. We \r\nhave simultaneously been waging a battle of economic reform, since 1985, by \r\nmeans of specific plans and programmes. What is at stake here is raising the \r\nstandard of living of every citizen. Included in this campaign are the \r\nefforts to eliminate illiteracy by the year 2000 and to enhance the status and \r\nrights of women. In mentioning these efforts, I should like to extend our \r\nthanks and gratitude to all the countries and international organizations and \r\nagencies that have supported our efforts to achieve a better life for our \r\ncitizens. \r\nThere are clear causes for concern in the international arena. However, \r\nthere are also reasons for hope. As the saying goes, life would be hard \r\nindeed were it not for hope. The Security Council has become more harmonious, \r\nwhich has enabled it to play a decisive role in solving international \r\ndisputes. It is no coincidence that we have seen the United Nations achieving \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n14-15 \r\n(Mr. Quid Moine. Mauritania) \r\nmore in the past two years in terms of the number of peace-keeping operations \r\nthan it had been able to achieve over several decades. \r\nProceeding from this, can we dream that all the peoples of the world will \r\nsoon get a taste of peace in view of the steps taken to reverse the arms race \r\nand limit armaments? We now see the parties to conflicts increasingly opting \r\nfor dialogue and reconciliation. This should create a favourable atmosphere \r\nto end all conflicts. \r\nNevertheless, all these shining signs of hope along the path of progress \r\nwill not be enough for the realization of peoples\u0027 aspirations for more \r\nfreedom, independence and prosperity unless they go hand in hand with a \r\nserious commitment to justice. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n16 \r\n(Mr. Quid Moine. Mauritania) \r\nIt would be no exaggeration to cite as an example the case of the \r\nPalestinian people, who continue to be deprived of their right to \r\nself-determination and independence while their sole legitimate \r\nrepresentative, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), continues to be \r\nexcluded and its national uprising is still being repressed. \r\nOur welcome for the Madrid Conference and the negotiating process that \r\nemanated from it last autumn stemmed from our hopes for peace in the region. \r\nHowever, we make no secret of the fact that we are concerned at the course \r\nthose negotiations are now taking. While the previous Government of Israel \r\nresorted to stalling and prevarication and had an \"anti\" position so far as \r\nany land concessions were concerned, Israel now has an administration that \r\nclaims willingness for dialogue. Therefore, we hope that cooperation between \r\nthis new administration and the peace-loving forces will lead to a \r\ncomprehensive and definitive solution to a problem that has been with us for \r\nfar too long and which has overtaxed a people which wants nothing but to \r\nachieve its rights to independence and peace. We believe the only solution is \r\nwithdrawal by Israel from all the Arab-occupied territories, foremost among \r\nwhich is the Holy City of Al-Quds, adherence by Israel to the agreed \r\ninternational obligations and principles and implementation by Israel of the \r\nresolutions of this Organization. \r\nWhile on the subject of the Middle East and the hope that international \r\nlegality may have the upper hand and put an end to the long suffering of the \r\npeoples of that area, we reaffirm our rejection of any attempt that aims at \r\nundermining the territorial integrity of Iraq and its independence as well as \r\nany action that may jeopardize the safety, security or independence of Kuwait. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n17 \r\n(Mr. Quid Moine. Mauritania) \r\nWhile we support fully the sisterly country of the United Arab Emirates, \r\nin its demands regarding its legitimate rights over the island of Abu Mousa, \r\nwe wish to express surprise at the actions of Iran in this respect and call \r\nupon Iran to deal with this problem in accordance with the agreements between \r\nthe two countries within a context of good-neighbourliness, mutual respect and \r\nbrotherliness. \r\nThe achievement of the unity between the countries of the Arab Maghreb, \r\nwhich we have the honour of chairing this year, is a hope that all the peoples \r\nof the area look forward to in order for them to achieve their aspirations \r\nafter integration, prosperity and development. An important area such as \r\nthis, with more than 60 million inhabitants, coasts from the Mediterranean to \r\nthe Atlantic, rich economic resources and a position that makes it a \r\ngeographic and cultural bridge between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa, should \r\nget enough support from the United Nations to remove all the obstacles that \r\nimpede its development and progress. \r\nIt is no exaggeration to state that all the Arab Maghreb has been hurt by \r\nthe blockage imposed against Libya. In view of the fact that Libya has \r\ndeclared its full readiness to cooperate with the United Nations and in view \r\nof the constructive proposals contained in the Arab League\u0027s decision 5092 of \r\n12 September 1992, we hope the international community will show understanding \r\nfor this fair position and reach a solution that will satisfy all and spare \r\nthe Maghreb problems it can do without. \r\nIn the Western Sahara, the United Nations, in coordination with the \r\nOrganization of African Unity, continues to deploy efforts which aim at \r\novercoming obstacles in the field so that suspicion may not replace the early \r\noptimism that prevailed in the area in the wake of the signing of the \r\ncease-fire agreement on 6 September 1991. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n18 \r\n(Mr. Quid Moine. Mauritania) \r\nWe are determined to continue efforts that would lead our Moroccan and \r\nSahraoui brethren to a permanent peace that, no doubt, will be a vital factor \r\nin building the Arab Maghreb. \r\nThe resumption of diplomatic relations between Mauritania and Senegal \r\nlast April, the resumption of daily flights between the two countries and the \r\nopening of borders indicate the turning of a new leaf in the relations of the \r\ntwo countries. The resumption of cooperation between our two peoples is proof \r\nthat the leaders of both countries are determined to put behind them this \r\npainful era in order for the two countries to focus on winning the battle for \r\ndevelopment. \r\nThe last Nouakchott summit which brought together the leaders of Mali, \r\nSenegal and Mauritania with the aim of achieving the goals of the organization \r\nof the investment of the Senegal river, was a model to be followed in the area \r\nof common African action. \r\nIn South Africa, the road to the establishment of a real non-racial \r\ndemocratic system is still full of obstacles despite the progress achieved \r\nover the past two years. The most dangerous obstacle is the violence that, in \r\nfive years, has claimed the lives of thousands of people. Consequently, the \r\ninternational community should remain vigilant until the objectives of the \r\nUnited Nations declaration of 14 December 1989 have been achieved in full. \r\nDespite the tragedies and evils and atrocities that sadden the heart in \r\nSomalia, there are still hearts that are full of goodness. In this context, \r\nwe must express gratitude to those who have helped Somalia and have made every \r\neffort to ensure arrival of their humanitarian assistance to it in the face of \r\nconsiderable difficulties. To all those I extend the thanks of my country and \r\nI appeal to our brethren in Somalia to let reason reign, put the national \r\ninterest first and try to resolve their problems democratically, by dialogue. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n19-20 \r\n(Mr. Quid Moine. Mauritania) \r\nIn Latin America, as in Asia, we have seen how democratic development and \r\ndialogue have helped to solve many thorny problems and disputes. Two years \r\nafter resolving the question of Nicaragua, peace reigns in El Salvador. \r\nThe most important event in Afghanistan was the accession to power by the \r\nMujahideen after a long devastating war. Our recognition of the new \r\nauthorities in Afghanistan was an expression of our satisfaction with this \r\ndevelopment. We hope that Afghanistan, after the return of its sons, will be \r\nable to overcome factional strife and, thereby, embark on a much needed \r\nprocess of national reconstruction. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n21 \r\n(Mr. Quid Moine. Mauritania) \r\nWe reiterate our support for the Paris Agreements on Cambodia, which \r\ncommit all political factions to work for peace in that country. We regret \r\nthe delay in implementing some of the items of those Agreements, and feel that \r\na careful study should be made of the reasons behind such delay with a view to \r\ndetermining the type of measures that would enable the United Nations \r\nTransitional Authority in Cambodia to discharge their task as fully as \r\npossible. \r\nThere is no doubt that accession by the two Koreas to the membership of \r\nthe United Nations is an event that justifies the hope that Korea will be \r\nunified eventually by peaceful means, through dialogue and consultation. \r\nThe United Nations stands today at an important crossroads. The \r\nOrganization must regain its prestige in order for it to be able to rise to \r\nthe many challenges posed by the international changes on the horizon. In \r\nthis context, the reorganization of the Secretariat would enable us to find \r\nthe right instrument to face up to those coming challenges in which the \r\nquestion of development should be paramount. We have great hopes that this \r\nnew era will create an appropriate atmosphere for new, more equitable and \r\ndemocratic international relations. Nothing can help achieve these \r\naspirations of all peoples and nations more than justice and democracy. \r\nMr. JESZENSZKY (Hungary): Allow me to express to you my sincere \r\ncongratulations on your election as President of the forty-seventh session of \r\nthe General Assembly. At the same time, let me once again wish much success \r\nto the Secretary-General of our Organization. \r\nThe scale of the changes that have taken place lately on the \r\ninternational scene is amply demonstrated by the sheer number of new \r\ndelegations that have joined our ranks at the United Nations. In large areas \r\nof our globe, which were shown on the map hitherto only by single-coloured \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n22 \r\n(Mr. Jeszenszky. Hungary) \r\nexpanses representing federations held together by totalitarian power, we see \r\ntoday a colourful collection of independent States that have regained or are \r\nabout to gain their sovereignty. There are few countries whose external \r\nrelations have been affected by these changes as directly and as deeply as \r\nours. The number of Hungary\u0027s neighbours has grown from five to seven, and \r\nfive of them will be shown as independent States only on maps that are to be \r\npublished in the coming months. \r\nTwo years ago, when I first had the opportunity to address this forum as \r\nthe representative of a Hungarian government formed following the first free \r\nelections in 45 years, I returned home convinced that the fresh breeze of \r\nhistory was having a reinvigorating effect on the activities of the United \r\nNations as well. The downfall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe not \r\nonly opened a new chapter in the lives of the peoples of the region, but set \r\non a new course the whole system of international relations. The ensuing \r\ntotal collapse of the bipolar world system and the fading away of the \r\nparalysing effect of great-Power confrontation raised particularly high \r\nexpectations. It appeared that the world Organization would be able to \r\nrespond effectively in all instances to the challenges to international peace \r\nand security. \r\nThese hopes and expectations, and the faith of some in a swift and \r\nradical renewal, are contrasted today by many with the present situation in \r\nthe world and at the United Nations. Certain sectors of the public view the \r\nevents of the last year as a dissipation of the hopes fostered by the historic \r\nturn of events in 1989 and 1990. They cite the tragedies of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, Croatia, Somalia, Karabakh, Abkhazia and other regions, the grave \r\nand massive violations of human rights, and the persistence of serious \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n23 \r\n(Mr. Jeszenszky. Hungary) \r\neconomic and social tensions in the world, and reproach the world Organization \r\nfor not managing the crises effectively. However, we have to show that the \r\nUnited Nations has not retreated from the role it played and regarded as a \r\nhistoric milestone when the Coalition forces, on the basis of the Security \r\nCouncil\u0027s authorization, acted against the aggressor and liberated Kuwait. \r\nAn important stage in this field was the summit meeting of the Security \r\nCouncil in January, which renewed the commitment of the Member States to the \r\ncollective security system of the United Nations. As a result of this \r\nmeeting, it seems that preventive diplomacy has now entered the minds of \r\npolitical decision makers as a most promising method of crisis management. \r\nWe set high value on the substantive and action-oriented report entitled \r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277) that the Secretary-General has prepared on \r\nthe Security Council\u0027s initiative. In our view, it makes good use of the \r\npossibilities inherent in the Charter and may serve as a good point of \r\ndeparture for the efforts directed at enhancing the effectiveness of the \r\ncrisis-prevention, peacemaking, peace-building and peace-keeping role of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\nNow that the relationship between the great Powers is determined not by \r\nopposition but agreement and a consistent search for consensus, the dust can \r\nbe blown off those chapters of the Charter that are related to the \r\ninternational collective security system and had almost become a historic \r\nrelic. We also concur with the Secretary-General\u0027s recommendations concerning \r\na stronger role for the International Court of Justice and the regional \r\norganizations. In this connection, I wish to announce that the Hungarian \r\nGovernment, empowered by a recent decision of the parliament, will deposit \r\nwith the Secretary-General the declaration recognizing as compulsory the \r\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n24-25 \r\n(Mr. Jeszenszky. Hungary) \r\nIn view of the fact that the emergence of regional hotbeds of tension is \r\noften engendered by conflicts within individual States, one can rightly say in \r\nconnection with the Agenda for Peace that the viability of preventive \r\ndiplomacy depends to a decisive extent on how we deal with the relationship \r\nbetween the sovereignty of the State concerned and the preventive measures \r\ntaken by the international community. \r\nEven if an internal conflict can be localized and does not transcend the \r\nborders of the country, it has a direct effect on the situation and stability \r\nof neighbouring States and, thus, on international peace and security: the \r\nstrands of bilateral and multilateral political and economic cooperation are \r\nweakened, instability emerges, an atmosphere of mistrust prevails, there are \r\nmassive flows of refugees, environmental damage from the conflict spills over, \r\nand so on. It must be stated that in our world today, preventive diplomacy \r\ncan succeed so long as individual States, already at the early stages of the \r\ndevelopment of a problem, do make use in a responsible manner of the \r\ncrisis-prevention possibilities provided by the world Organization and do not \r\nregard them as an impairment of their sovereignty. On the other hand, if such \r\npossibilities remain unexploited and the problems start festering, the \r\nOrganization must be prepared to act resolutely, effectively and swiftly, \r\nmaking use of all means at its disposal against a State that threatens peace \r\nand security. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n26 \r\n(Mr. Jeszenszky. Hungary) \r\nIn the course of the crisis management of recent years the Security \r\nCouncil has set precedents the latest being the condemnation of \"ethnic \r\ncleansing\" and of breaches of international humanitarian law in Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina which make it unambiguously clear that respect for human rights, \r\nincluding the rights of minority communities, is an integral aspect of \r\ninternational peace and security and can by no means be regarded as an \r\ninternal affair. \r\nIt is therefore of fundamental importance that the Security Council pay \r\nclose attention to grave human-rights violations in individual States. Action \r\nin this field by the international community is a legitimate manifestation of \r\nour common concern and responsibility. This constantly expanding dimension of \r\nthe Security Council\u0027s activity is in accord with the Charter and should be \r\nincorporated into preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and, in \r\nparticular, peace-building. \r\nWith regard to the practical tasks related to these activities at the \r\nUnited Nations, some progress can be made in the short run, beginning with the \r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly. For example, we can take steps with \r\nregard to the initiative concerning the establishment, within national \r\nframeworks, of standby forces for the peacemaking and peace-keeping activities \r\nof the United Nations. Those Governments that have already made specific \r\noffers to this end have demonstrated an exemplary attitude. Hungary is ready \r\nto do likewise. We are in favour of another initiative aimed at the \r\nestablishment of a temporary reserve fund to meet the initial cost of \r\npeace-keeping operations. \r\nHungary also supports the Secretary-General\u0027s proposal that, even on the \r\nrequest of only one of the parties to a conflict, international monitors could \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n27 \r\n(Mr. Jeszenszky. Hungary) \r\nbe deployed on the territory, including its border areas, of the requesting \r\nparty. These measures could be similar to those planned for the near future, \r\nwith the support of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, in \r\nconnection with the Southern Slav crisis, in the form of monitoring missions \r\nto be sent to Hungary and other States. \r\nCentral and Eastern Europe are the scene of one of the major changes in \r\ninternational relations. Here the scenario of almost euphoric expectations \r\nand of ensuing disillusionment is played out in an especially dramatic way. \r\nFollowing the demise of communism, it seemed that the outlines of a new and \r\nunifying Europe were appearing on the horizon. The States in the region were \r\nfaced simultaneously with the tasks of returning to Europe, both symbolically \r\nand in reality, and of ending the conflicts that for centuries had plagued \r\nrelations between their peoples. We had every right to hope that, this time, \r\nthe past would not be repeated and that, with guidance through jointly \r\nproclaimed democratic ideals, the recognition of interdependence would prevail \r\nover confrontation. \r\nFor the peoples of multinational States welded together by coercion and \r\ntotalitarian methods, the spread of democracy has also become an experience of \r\nnational emancipation. It is a telling fact that, following more than seven \r\ndecades of existence, all three federal States bordering my country recently \r\ndisintegrated with tempestuous speed or are undergoing a process of \r\ndisintegration. _ In our view, it is wrong to regard such processes as an \r\nentirely retrograde phenomenon and contrasting them with modern \r\nintegrationist tendencies to deplore them. Internal turmoil, efforts at \r\nsecession and the breakup of existing State frameworks are most likely to \r\noccur where integration does not enjoy genuine popular endorsement and where \r\ndemocratic mechanisms for conflict management are lacking. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n28 \r\n(Mr. Jeszenszky. Hungary) \r\nToday the key issue of stability and security in Central and Eastern \r\nEurope is recognition and promotion of the endeavours of peoples for \r\nself-determination and of the endeavours of national minorities to secure \r\nadequate forms of self-government. This can be advanced only through the \r\ncombined efforts of the parties concerned and the international community, in \r\nconformity with the basic norms of international law. \r\nFor these peoples, endeavours towards self-determination constitute the \r\nfirst, and apparently unavoidable, step on the road back to Europe the road \r\nto participation in a new and voluntary integration. On the other hand and \r\nit is gratifying to be able to say this more and more people now recognize \r\nthe compelling need to deal positively with the problem of national \r\nminorities, including those people who, only recently, persisted in denying \r\nthe reality of such questions. \r\nHowever, it is a mistake for anyone to seek to achieve self-determination \r\nand self-government by resurrecting the nineteenth century concept of the \r\nnation State, and it is a crime to advance that concept by redrawing frontiers \r\nby force or \"ethnic cleansing\". We are all well aware that attempts to create \r\nso-called ethnically pure States have more than once in history degenerated \r\ninto massive tragedy, naked aggression and crimes against humanity and against \r\nminorities. \r\nThe enormous changes that are taking place in our region pose yet another \r\npressing problem: how are we to ensure success for this unprecedented and \r\nhistoric transformation, which is occurring in difficult conditions? We have \r\nto cope with a hard legacy, bequeathed by the past, a legacy that is a source \r\nof complex problems to solve and of lurking dangers to avoid. The transition \r\nfrom dictatorship and so-called planned economies to political pluralism and \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n29 \r\n(Mr. Jeszenszky. Hungary) \r\nmarket economies is an uncharted path, lacking time-tested models or \r\nexamples. This process involves tension and sharp internal debate, both \r\neconomic and social, just as it produces unresolved external problems. \r\nIn this respect, I should like to mention the vitally important legal, \r\necological and navigational problems that arose along one of our fluvial \r\nfrontiers as a result of the construction of a hydroelectric dam on the River \r\nDanube. Much to our regret, the bilateral talks aimed at finding a solution \r\nto the problem have so far been unproductive. We want to do everything \r\npossible to ensure that Hungary and the neighbour in question, with welcome \r\ninternational assistance, can find a mutually acceptable solution rather than \r\nadd another source of conflict to our region, which is already ridden with \r\ntension. \r\nThe transformations sweeping through Central and Eastern Europe present \r\nanother question: how are the dark shadows accompanying the rebirth of \r\nfreedom and democracy to be confronted? These transformations must be \r\nprotected from all extremes: from the demons of totalitarianism, of whatever \r\ncolour; from the revival of various brown-shirt ideologies; and from attempts \r\nto paint over communism with national colours. All these things, with their \r\ndemagogic appeal and offer of temptingly simplistic solutions, can only \r\nundermine and ruin the unsparing and strenuous efforts to establish and \r\nstrengthen the rule of law. \r\nHungary is convinced that it will prove to be equal to the historic \r\nchallenge and will bring about the triumph of the universal and lasting values \r\nof our civilization. However, the peoples of our region are far from being \r\nthe only ones affected by this task and interested in mastering it. \r\nTherefore, their efforts to ensure that democratic values prevail require and \r\ndeserve international support. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n30 \r\n(Mr. Jeszenszky. Hungary) \r\nIn the immediate neighbourhood of my country in the former Yugoslavia \r\nthe gravest crimes and violations of human rights continue to occur. The \r\nSouthern Slav crisis has for more than a year gravely endangered international \r\npeace and security through aggressive nationalism, dictatorial government, the \r\nforcible acquisition of territory, \"ethnic cleansing\", the intimidation of \r\nminorities and the daily suffering of the 2 million people who have been \r\nchased from their homes. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n31 \r\n(Mr. Jeszenszky. Hungary) \r\nGrave responsibility for the outbreak of the crisis and the spread of the \r\nconflict to successive new areas rests with Serbian nationalism and its \r\nregular and irregular armed forces. The value judgement of the international \r\ncommunity in that respect was expressed again as recently as last week in the \r\nrelevant General Assembly resolution. We believe that the Security Council \r\ntoo must take further concrete measures to promote a comprehensive, lasting \r\nand equitable settlement of the crisis. It is indispensable to expand the \r\ninternational presence in the territory of the former Yugoslavia and to \r\nincrease its effectiveness. The peace-keeping forces of the United Nations, \r\nwhich have earned all our recognition, should have their mandate extended, \r\nwith their preventive deployment in areas where such action is warranted and \r\nhas not been taken so far. \r\nThe brutality raging almost undisturbed in the territory of the former \r\nYugoslavia is a telling signal that the world has not yet done everything \r\npossible to enforce, with all the means at its disposal, the purposes and \r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter. The aggressor must be made aware that \r\nthe international community, including the States of Europe, will under no \r\ncircumstances acquiesce in situations brought about as a result of violent \r\nconquests and inhumane actions, and is prepared to cast out from among its \r\nranks all those who would want to pull our continent back to the age of \r\nbarbarism. On the threshold of a new world full of great opportunities, the \r\nUnited Nations must take a firm stand against aggressions and breaches of \r\nlaw. It is no exaggeration to say that the peace and tranquillity of present \r\nand future generations will depend on that choice. \r\nIt is with deep concern that our public opinion is following the \r\ndevelopments of the situation of the Hungarian minority in Serbian Vojvodina \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n32 \r\n(Mr. Jeszenszky. Hungary) \r\nand other areas under Serbian control, where a Hungarian community close to \r\nhalf a million lives in increasing danger and under threat. Serbian policy \r\nnot only has chased tens of thousands of Hungarians from their ancestral \r\nhomes, but is now intent on settling several thousand Serbian refugees in \r\nterritories of Vojvodina and Croatia inhabited by Hungarians and others, \r\nthereby forcibly changing the ethnic composition of whole areas. This is a \r\ngrave violation of resolutions of the Security Council and of the decisions of \r\nthe London Conference, which demands an adequate response. \r\nRecently, Hungary has given shelter to over 80,000 refugees from the \r\nformer Yugoslavia, in addition to the more than 50,000 who had arrived earlier \r\nfrom another neighbouring country. I know from personal experience that these \r\nrefugees are eager to return, but the conditions that would enable them to do \r\nso are, unfortunately, not yet ripe. In order to create such conditions as \r\nsoon as possible, we consider it necessary for the United Nations forces in \r\nthe former Yugoslavia to assume an active role in conformity with the Vance \r\nplan to assist the safe return of the refugees, to create conditions under \r\nwhich the right of the returnees can be guaranteed and the prosecution of \r\nthose responsible for violations of law can take place. The Hungarian side \r\noffers its full cooperation to this end. \r\nWe cannot speak of freedom, democracy, justice and, consequently, of \r\nthe rule of law when the rights of national, ethnic, linguistic or religious \r\nminorities are not respected. The legitimate aspirations of the minorities \r\nto preserve their identity, language, culture and religion, as well as to \r\nfoster relations with their mother nations, do not at all call into question \r\ntheir loyalty as citizens. These aspirations, therefore, cannot be regarded \r\nas a threat to the unity of the State. The various concepts of autonomy \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n33 \r\n(Mr. Jeszenszky. Hungary) \r\narising out of a particular minority situation do not call into question the \r\nframework of the State concerned. Their purpose is to create the proper \r\nconditions for the self-government of minorities and for the exercise of their \r\nrights in a way that fits into the consitutional and legal order. Life \r\ndemonstrates that orderly minorities do not weaken, on the contrary, they \r\nunequivocally strengthen the stability of the State and its internal social \r\npeace. In this connection, we sincerely welcome the settlement by Austria and \r\nItaly of the issue of Alto Adige-Sud Tirol. This example may be worth \r\nfollowing as a democratic solution for minority problems and may serve as a \r\ncredible counterargument in the face of those forces that do not tire of \r\nsuggesting, by way of whispered propaganda or spectacular and noisy \r\ndemonstrations, that the raising of such questions is meant only to conceal \r\nterritorial demands. \r\nThe United Nations, as the most comprehensive multilateral organization, \r\nhas a major role to play in the promotion of the rights of minorities. We \r\nattach particularly great significance to the completion of the draft \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Persons belonging to National, Ethnic, Religious \r\nand Linguistic Minorities. We see this as an important initial stage of a \r\nprocess. However, the effective protection of minorities also requires the \r\ndrawing up of binding international norms. Consequently, we consider it \r\ndesirable to start the relevant codification process as soon as possible. \r\nIn the field of minority protection, it is essential to introduce an \r\ninstitutional system of international guarantees and to create suitable \r\nfact-finding, monitoring, conciliation and counselling mechanisms, such as a \r\ncomplaints mechanism with the competent international forums. These forums \r\nwould be empowered to investigate infringements of minority rights, identify \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n34-35 \r\n(Mr. Jeszenszky. Hungary) \r\nthose responsible, eliminate the consequences of the infringement of rights \r\nand compensate the injured party. In this context, mention must be made of \r\nthe important step forward taken by the Conference on Security and Cooperation \r\nin Europe with the establishment of the Office of High Commissioner on \r\nNational Minorities. \r\nWe must all trust that the conflicts inevitably arising out of the \r\nradical transformations in our world will be solved through dialogue, \r\ncompromise and, when necessary, recourse to international forums. Even crises \r\nand difficulties cannot eclipse the fact that since the end of the cold war \r\nthe international community has become capable of taking incomparably more \r\nefficient measures than previously to deal with threats to international peace \r\nand security. Hungary is convinced that our rejuvenating world Organization \r\nwill overcome the \"too-little-too-late\" syndrome, will also have the necessary \r\nfinancial resources and as a result of the reforms already under way will \r\nbe in a better position to meet the requirements of our times. In this field, \r\nas in so many others, we must be ready to leave behind an old era that should \r\nnever return. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n36 \r\nMr. TOURE (Mali) (interpretation from French): The delegation of \r\nthe Republic of Mali, which I have the honour to lead, welcomes your \r\noutstanding election, Sir, to the presidency of the General Assembly at its \r\nforty-seventh session. We are convinced that your great skills as a diplomat \r\nwill enable you to guide the work of our Assembly wisely and effectively. I \r\ncan assure you that you will receive our full cooperation throughout this \r\nsession. \r\nWe also warmly congratulate your predecessor, Ambassador Shihabi, \r\nPermanent Representative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the United Nations, \r\nwho presided over the work of the forty-sixth session with remarkable \r\nefficiency. \r\nFinally, we are pleased to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved \r\ntribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who is working tirelessly for the strengthening of \r\nthe United Nations, the maintenance of peace, and the flourishing of our \r\nOrganization. \r\nMy delegation welcomes the new Member States, whose presence here \r\nconfirms the universality of our Organization and the inestimable value of the \r\nideals and principles contained in the Charter. \r\nMy country, Mali, has undergone profound political changes over the last \r\ntwo years. On 26 March 1991, at the cost of enormous sacrifice but with \r\nclarity of purpose, our people brought a monolithic dictatorial regime to an \r\nend. The united actions of democratic forces made it possible to organize a \r\ntransition, to ensure the normal functioning of elections, and to establish \r\nthe institutions of the Third Republic. Thus the National Conference held in \r\nBamako from 29 July to 12 August 1991 drew up the fundamental instruments for \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Mali) \r\nthe Third Republic of Mali. The democratic process has continued in \r\naccordance with a precise electoral timetable, drawn up with the contributions \r\nand assistance of all the country\u0027s political forces. The campaigning of some \r\n40 political parties confirmed the irreversible commitment of the country \r\ntowards a political opening which is unprecedented in the history of modern \r\nMali. \r\nThe election of the President of the Third Republic, His Excellency \r\nMr. Alpha Oumar Konare, and his official appointment on 8 June 1992 are the \r\nculmination of long years of struggle and sacrifice of an entire people. A \r\nnew Coalition Government is in place and a National Assembly made up of 11 \r\npolitical parties is working to strengthen the administration, the rule of law \r\nand respect for human rights in the Republic of Mali. \r\nTo conclude this chapter, I should like to express the profound gratitude \r\nof the people and the Government of Mali to friendly countries and to \r\ninternational organizations and agencies, in particular the United Nations \r\nsystem, for their valuable advice and their excellent contributions to the \r\nvarious electoral consultations which led to the establishment of a pluralist \r\ndemocracy. \r\nThe young Malian democracy was nevertheless born with a serious handicap, \r\nthat of the burdensome heritage of a past of several decades of dictatorship, \r\nbad management, a single-party system and quasi-indifference to the suffering \r\nof the population. This intolerable political situation, aggravated by the \r\nimpact of the drought and by continuing deterioration of living conditions in \r\narid zones, finally led to a rebellion among the nomadic population in the \r\nnorth in 1990. To resolve this painful problem the Government decided on a \r\nnegotiated solution. Algerian mediation, along with assistance from friendly \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n38 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Mali) \r\ncountries and from certain eminent foreign personalities, made it possible for \r\nus to create an atmosphere of mutual trust. Thus on 11 April 1992 in Bamako a \r\nNational Pact was signed, between the Government and all of these rebel \r\nmovements, before the nation and the whole of Africa and in the presence of \r\nrepresentatives from all continents. This agreement was accepted by all \r\nparties as an instrument of peace, solidarity and national unity. \r\nThe agreement is first an act of national will, a plan of action to \r\ncombat drought and desertification, and as such falls within the scope of \r\nAgenda 21. It is also a plan for agropastoral development requiring the use \r\nof technologies adapted to arid and semi-arid zones and calling for the \r\nre-establishment of populations in a damaged and vulnerable environment. It \r\nis an integrated programme for human development designed to unleash the \r\ninitiative and production potential of men and women living in these areas. \r\nFinally, it includes a strict respect for sovereignty and the territorial \r\nintegrity of our country, but also a recognition of the right to diversity. \r\nThe fresh hope it has stirred and its implementation require the \r\nmobilization of major resources that greatly exceed our own capacities. That \r\nis why my Government appeals to the international community, to governmental \r\nand non-governmental organizations involved in cooperation, and to the good \r\nwill of all to help us to implement the various programmes under the \r\nagreement. The National Pact remains for my country the ideal means for \r\nensuring peace and security, indispensable conditions for our development. \r\nThis development is imperative, and everything will be done by the Mali \r\nGovernment to ensure the full implementation of all aspects of the agreement. \r\nWe should like the same to hold for all signatories old and new alike. The \r\nMali of today which respects human rights stresses dialogue and rejects \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n39 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Mali) \r\nviolence as a means of expression. Our young democracy allows all its sons \r\nand daughters to express themselves freely and to defend their interests \r\nwithin the framework of political parties or associations. This context must, \r\nfirstly, permit the reconciliation of hearts and spirits; secondly, it must \r\nconsolidate the peace which has been restored and thus ensure resumption of \r\nthe development activities in the northern regions of our country which, for \r\nlack of security, had been abandoned over the last two years by most of our \r\ndevelopment partners. \r\nBut neither the problem of the north nor the economic difficulties of the \r\ncountry have hampered the will or the determination of our people to take \r\ncharge of and succeed in their development. These are signs of hope and \r\npledges of success that the new conditions of democracy will reinforce. \r\nThe deterioration in the political situation in certain parts of the \r\nworld is of concern to our delegation. At a time when the international \r\ncommunity thought it had seen the last of the great human tragedies which have \r\nlong darkened many regions of the world, now societies of old civilizations \r\nhave been drawn into the whirlwind of fratricidal conflicts. \r\nMali is concerned by the situation existing in the Horn of Africa, in \r\nparticular in Somalia. In addition to drought, the escalation of violence in \r\ntenacious rivalries of factions confronting one another desperately and, \r\napparently, without any real justification, has subjected the Somali \r\npopulation to terrible suffering. Food shortages, endemic famine and \r\nmalnutrition, and refugees flowing into neighbouring countries are all \r\nsituations requiring more intensive humanitarian intervention by the United \r\nNations to support the praiseworthy efforts of the Organization of African \r\nUnity and of many others of good will. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n40 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Mali) \r\nIn South Africa, the delicate process of change towards the establishment \r\nof a State based on law and on fundamental principles of democracy and of \r\nrespect for human rights remains fragile in many respects. The negotiations \r\nin the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) offer an opening we \r\nheartily welcome. But the violence that has been provoked and encouraged by \r\nthe enemies of change threatens to delay the advent of a free, democratic and \r\nmultiracial South Africa. \r\nA lessening in diplomatic isolation and the progressive lifting of \r\neconomic and sports sanctions are gestures of goodwill by the international \r\ncommunity. It is thus time for the South African Government to explore the \r\nopportunities offered to it to assume its responsibilities all of its \r\nresponsibilities in order to halt the cycle of violence and to create \r\nconditions conducive to genuine negotiations.* \r\nIn addition, the serious crisis afflicting Liberia for several years \r\ncontinues despite the efforts of the Heads of State of the Economic Community \r\nof West African States (ECOWAS). Mali hopes that the relevant decisions taken \r\nat the ECOWAS Summit in Dakar will be honoured by all the parties to this \r\nfratricidal conflict so that the West African subregion can regain its balance \r\nand stability. \r\n* Mr. Fonseca (Cape Verde), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n41 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Mali) \r\nMy delegation is pleased that in Angola the process of national \r\nreconciliation has made it possible to establish a true democratic process, \r\nthus finally bringing a long-lasting tragedy to an end. \r\nAs regards Mozambique, we hope that consultation and dialogue will \r\nprevail over the use of arms. \r\nThe sensitive question of Western Sahara remains pending as we await the \r\nimplementation of all the provisions of the United Nations peace plan. Mali \r\nurges all the parties concerned to let consensual approaches prevail in \r\ndealing with that thorny problem so as to enable the United Nations to \r\naccomplish its mission. \r\nThe breakup of Yugoslavia has taken the form of a cruel ethnic war, which \r\nhas led the United Nations to increase its initiatives in order to put an end \r\nto the tragedy of millions of elderly people, women and children. \r\nOne of the oldest conflicts, that of the Middle East, which our \r\nOrganization has dealt with for several decades, has seen encouraging \r\ndevelopments with the opening and continuation of Israeli-Arab negotiations. \r\nThe international community must encourage the process that is under way, so \r\nthat contacts will lead to a just and lasting peace. For our part, Mali \r\nreaffirms its support for any initiative leading to a comprehensive and \r\nlasting solution to that conflict, which must necessarily include, first, \r\nIsrael\u0027s full withdrawal from the occupied territories; secondly, the \r\nrecognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and \r\nindependence; and thirdly, the right of all States in the region to exist \r\nwithin secure and recognized borders. \r\nWe are pleased to note that the United Nations peace plan in Cambodia is \r\nnow operational. This is proof that perseverance, mutual trust and dialogue \r\nare effective weapons in preventive diplomacy. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Mali) \r\nTurning to the Korean peninsula, Mali, which maintains good relations \r\nwith both Koreas, encourages the process of direct negotiations embarked upon \r\nby both parties with a view to the peaceful reunification of the Korean \r\nhomeland. \r\nIndeed, all round the world, Mali hopes for the restoration of peace \r\nthrough dialogue and agreement. Once rid of the spectre of violence and war, \r\nthe United Nations will be able to devote its human, technical and financial \r\npotential to the noble objectives of economic and social development, so much \r\nneeded by the world. \r\nWhile, politically, the beginning of the 1990s has ushered in an era of \r\ndemocracy for many developing countries, and most particularly for those in \r\nAfrica, the economic situation of our countries remains extremely critical. \r\nIndeed, unlike the industrialized countries, where we have seen a recovery in \r\neconomic activity under the triple impact of a decrease in interest rates, the \r\nreturn of oil prices to a level close to that existing before the crisis and \r\nthe effective coordination of economic policies, in developing countries the \r\nsituation has been marked, overall, by continuing serious economic and \r\nfinancial difficulties, deterioration of the terms of trade, a scarcity of \r\nfinancial resources for private investment, debt burden and grave doubts \r\nregarding the conclusions of multilateral trade negotiations and the threat of \r\nprotectionism. In order to prevent the profound imbalances augured by that \r\nsituation, our countries agreed to carry out structural adjustment reforms in \r\norder to open themselves up more to the world economy. However, we remain \r\nconvinced that in order to emerge from the crisis and at the same time save \r\nour democratic experience, international solidarity must be made manifest. It \r\nmust develop rapidly and be equal to the problems to be solved. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n43 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Mali) \r\nThe international community must strive to free up, for the poorest \r\ncountries, sufficient resources to correct the imbalances in our economies, to \r\nmitigate the effects of adjustment on the most vulnerable sectors and to \r\npermit the financing of priority programmes for basic development. \r\nHopes for reforms in international economic relations to reduce \r\ninequalities between the developed and the developing countries are, \r\nunfortunately, still being frustrated by a lack of progress in the \r\nestablishment of an appropriate North-South dialogue. South-South cooperation \r\nand subregional economic cooperation, enabling developing countries to \r\novercome certain difficulties through a rational use of their \r\ncomplementarities can also help to reopen the irreplaceable North-South \r\ndialogue. \r\nSome progress has been achieved in subregional economic integration, but \r\nour Organization must support that process by formulating policies that will \r\ncreate common economic configurations at the subregional level. It is for all \r\nthese reasons that the Government of Mali strongly supports the spirit of \r\nstructural reform and supports the efforts of the Secretary-General in this \r\ncontext. \r\nAs a Sahelian country, Mali was pleased with the holding of the Earth \r\nSummit in Rio de Janeiro and is pleased with its pertinent recommendations. \r\nThis is an opportunity for us to recall that in the face of the serious \r\nthreats hanging over our planet, the international community as a whole must \r\nset up, for its own survival, collective management of the environment that is \r\nmore responsible than it has been in the past, that is fairer and truly \r\nuniversal. To that end it must undertake vigorous action to put an end to the \r\nuse of the countries in the South as dumps for toxic and nuclear waste from \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n44 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Mali) \r\nindustrialized countries. By the same token, we must help countries to combat \r\ndesertification, pollution and all other processes that are likely to threaten \r\nthe human habitat. \r\nOur Organization has contributed to the consolidation of security and \r\ncooperation among nations. It has never been so active and effective in the \r\nservice of peace. However, our most ardent desire is to see it evolve towards \r\ngreater democracy so as to respond to the major changes that have occurred \r\nrecently on the international scene. That democratization comes, necessarily, \r\nthrough taking into account all the interests of all the components of the \r\nUnited Nations in future reforms. \r\nHumanity finds itself at a stage in its history that requires the \r\ninternational community to display pragmatism, creativity and solidarity; in \r\nbrief, it must develop a fruitful system of partnership. Never in this \r\nrespect has mankind possessed so many human and technological assets. \r\nThus, we must build together a new international order based on equity \r\nand justice.* \r\nMr. PERES (Israel): Let me begin by congratulating you, Sir, and \r\nthe nation of Bulgaria, on your assumption of the presidency of the United \r\nNations General Assembly. May I also congratulate the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Boutros-Ghali, on his leadership in the struggle for peace. I wish him \r\nsuccess in his endeavours. \r\nToday I speak for an Israel that has chosen to step out of the shadows of \r\nthe past to prepare for the invitation of a new future. The world is alive \r\nwith the impulse for change. The end of conflict is no longer a Utopian \r\n* The President returned to the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n45 \r\n(Mr. Peres. Israel) \r\nfantasy. It is the dictate of realism and of universal self-interest. We \r\nlook to the future in a world that wants peace. \r\nLike a hidden Samson, the forces of change have pushed aside the pillars \r\nof conventional wisdom, which proclaimed that military power is the source of \r\nnational strength and prestige. This is no longer true. The cost of \r\nmaintaining a significantly large army can deplete the resources of the \r\nrichest countries, even if the weaponry remains unused. Around our changing \r\nworld, the flow of knowledge has superseded military might as the source of \r\nreal strength and social stability. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n46 \r\n(Mr. Peres. Israel) \r\nThe flow of knowledge no longer stops at national frontiers. It is not \r\npossible in the age of modern communications to shield peoples from truth and \r\nreality. Eventually, even dictators must face the fact that the best censors \r\ncannot block the free flow of ideas. But knowledge cannot be acquired without \r\nthe right to doubt, the readiness to change. Knowledge is not available \r\nwithout freedom, and so democracy is prevailing throughout the world. \r\nIn this new era, the era of knowledge, the governing principles are those \r\nof democratic structures, market-based economies, open borders, demilitarized \r\ninternational and regional relations, and respect for human rights. But while \r\nall nations should embrace these new principles, national traditions and \r\nidentities retain their power. Nation-States will remain the focus of \r\nallegiance and social pride. \r\nTo reconcile national identity, regional cooperation and universal \r\nsolidarities is the central issue of contemporary life. \r\nThe United Nations was established in an era that no longer exists. Yet \r\nits ideals and structures can meet the challenges and dangers of this new \r\nage. We support the \"Agenda for Peace\" offered by the Secretary-General. We \r\nsupport and will participate in the attempt to build a global protection \r\nsystem. \r\nThe United Nations must be the headquarters for an all-embracing struggle \r\nto safeguard the environment against new threats. It must be a powerhouse to \r\narrest starvation. It must develop the institutions and the ability to \r\nintervene when necessary to stop otherwise insoluble civil wars. The United \r\nNations must reorganize to face these problems in a global capacity. \r\nIn our own region, we must understand that even if our geography and \r\npeople have not changed, the world has changed. No longer can we live on \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Peres. Israel) \r\ndisappearing premises. For generations, the conflicts in the Middle East were \r\nnurtured by global conflicts by the cold war and hot competition. Within \r\nthe context of super-Power rivalry, the belligerents in the Middle East were \r\ngenerously supplied with shining armour. But where there were once evil \r\nempires, we now see only the desire for a peaceful world. Russia has \r\nchanged. The United States has emerged from the cold war with renewed respect \r\nfrom the world for its democratic drive for peace. The third world is \r\nchanging, with many nations ending old hostilities and building new \r\neconomies. In Africa, the forces of racism are being gradually driven out. \r\nIn the Middle East itself let\u0027s face it the peace between Israel and Egypt \r\nis attaining the respect of age. There is a fresh atmosphere in our time. \r\nThe time is now upon us for the nations of the Middle East to come to \r\nterms with the new realities, to make a living on their own. We can learn to \r\nbenefit from peaceful coexistence. If we are to survive, we must understand \r\nthat the dangers and opportunities we face are regional rather than national. \r\nIn an age of long-range missiles, national defence must be a collective \r\neffort. To provide our people with modern standards of living we must have \r\nopen borders and mutually beneficial exchanges. \r\nFor too long the Middle East has been caught up in national conflicts and \r\nnational rivalries for the glorification of national leaders. We need to \r\nbuild a new Middle East of, by and for the people. In our effort to build \r\nthis new future for the Middle East, Israel does not ignore its still existing \r\ndisagreements with our neighbours. The record shows that we are working to \r\nsolve them humanely, honourably and, wherever possible, permanently. We are \r\ncurrently engaged in bilateral negotiations to bring an end to the conflicts \r\nof the past and multilateral negotiations to lay the foundation for the future. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n48 \r\n(Mr. Peres. Israel) \r\nIn the bilateral negotiations, we are negotiating with the Jordanians, \r\nthe Palestinians, the Syrians and the Lebanese. The committed leadership of \r\nthe United States has played a central role in bringing all the parties into \r\nface-to-face negotiations. \r\nWith the Jordanians, the solutions are awaiting the parties. We face \r\ncommon problems we must confront together, including the possible Jordanian \r\nconnection to Palestinian self-government and beyond. Our relations with the \r\nHashemite Kingdom have seen open hostilities but also tacit efforts to \r\novercome these hostilities. We look forward to a complete peace with the \r\nKingdom of Jordan in the near future. \r\nWith the Palestinian people, our conflict has been long and painful. We \r\nseek to end this conflict. We are looking for a bridge to cross the gulf of \r\nbitter memories, painful hatreds and emotion-laden suspicions. We have \r\noffered to negotiate an interim or transitional goal. There is no difference \r\nbetween the two. In fact, one can note with satisfaction that the \r\nPalestinians have agreed to this gradual approach. The direction is clear, \r\neven if the bridge will be built slowly. \r\nThe suggested path is an interim self-government arrangement, as \r\nconceived at Camp David. We know that this proposal is imperfect in some \r\nrespects. Self-government is less than independence. But it offers the \r\nflexibility of an arrangement that will last no more than five years. During \r\nthis limited period of time, Palestinians in the territories will enjoy \r\nself-government. The opportunity to select, through democratic political \r\nelections, a Palestinian administrative council will enable the Palestinian \r\npeople to exercise a double measure of freedom: the freedom to govern their \r\nown lives and to do so politically and democratically. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n49-50 \r\n(Mr. Peres. Israel) \r\nBut instead of attempting to draw a map of a self-governing territory \r\nand it is doubtful that this could be achieved now we have suggested a \r\ndefinite timetable. So, while this proposal lacks the clarity of a map, it \r\nprovides the commitment of a calendar. This proposal is clearly a departure \r\nfrom the present situation. It has the dynamics of a voyage to a new destiny, \r\na bridge which begins at one shore and reaches another. \r\nI know it will not be an easy choice for either side. But neither the \r\nexisting situation nor the foreseeable future contains a more promising \r\nalternative. I am speaking for an Israeli Government that has firmly made up \r\nits mind and seeks the expeditious implementation of this proposal. \r\nIn negotiations, the parties tend to scrutinize every letter, every dot. \r\nI hope that the Palestinians will also perceive the spirit of our intent, \r\nwhich is to extricate ourselves from the position of domination over another \r\npeople. We have never in our history as a people sought domination over \r\nothers. We wholeheartedly seek a future where the children of both peoples \r\nwill escape the agonies of a distorted past and live under a clear sky of \r\nsecurity and hope. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. Peres. Israel) \r\nWith the Syrians, we have begun a dialogue in full daylight for the first \r\ntime in 44 years. It is necessary now to translate the change in the mood \r\nbetween our two nations into viable and carefully constructed accords \r\nexpressing a mutual interest in security and cooperation. \r\nWe call for a departure from old dogmas and all-embracing dictates, and \r\nwe hope the Syrians will adopt the same approach. We understand the need to \r\nsafeguard the security and freedom of both nations, theirs and ours. It is \r\nour responsibility to ensure that those who have survived the wars of the past \r\nwill have the opportunity to open a new peaceful chapter in the history of the \r\ntwo peoples. \r\nThe leaders of both countries should be directly involved in these \r\nnegotiations, which are in need of a new approach and creative thinking. I \r\ncall on the President of Syria to set aside his reservations and meet with the \r\nPrime Minister of Israel. \r\nWe have made clear to the Syrians that Security Council resolutions \r\n242 (1967) and 338 (1973) contain a territorial dimension, combined with other \r\ncomponents of peace and security which must be equally respected. \r\nWe believe in a comprehensive solution involving all issues and all \r\nparties. Yet we do not consider it wise to link one negotiation to another, \r\nor to postpone an agreement with one country because of delays elsewhere. One \r\nnegotiating process should not be handcuffed to another. \r\nWith respect to Lebanon, Israel holds no territorial claims; nor does it \r\nseek to influence the political destiny of that country. We recall peaceful \r\nrelations with Lebanon at a time when it was internally balanced and \r\ntranquil. We hope that such a time will return again. The moment Lebanon \r\nfinds peace within itself and independence from outside intervention, Lebanon \r\nand Israel will live in peace again. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. Peres. Israel) \r\nLooking at the bilateral negotiations, we recall that the success of our \r\nnegotiations with Egypt stemmed from dialogue at many levels of society: \r\ndecision makers, leaders, businessmen, academicians. We appeal to all our \r\nArab neighbours to establish the same dialogue today. There is no room for \r\ntimidity, reluctance or boycotts in a peace process. Peacemaking should not \r\nbe a hideaway operation. \r\nI hope our neighbours realize that Israel has implemented unilateral \r\nconfidence-building measures. We have drastically changed our settlement \r\npolicies, altered our policies towards the Palestinian people, offered new \r\nproposals for self-government and suggested target dates for the \r\nimplementation of this process. We have done these things unconditionally. \r\nYet confidence-building measures call for reciprocity. We seek an end to the \r\nunjustified economic boycott and the cessation of terror. \r\nWe shall not allow ourselves or our adversaries to escape this chance for \r\npeace. Yet we cannot turn our region into a new Middle East by just \r\nnegotiating old disputes. Our new challenges are on our horizons, not only in \r\nour frontiers. \r\nWe say to our Arab neighbours: the real danger is not Israel. The real \r\ndanger is poverty. The real danger is poverty that creates protest, even if \r\nit is occasionally cloaked in a religious mantle. Poverty and protest \r\nendanger both the Arab nations and Israel. Israel does not want to become an \r\nisolated island in an ocean of resentment. \r\nTwo hundred forty million people live today in the Middle East. The \r\nmajority of them live in a state of want. In 30 years, there will be \r\n500 million people in the region, two thirds residing in Africa, one third in \r\nAsia. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Peres. Israel) \r\nThe poverty of the Middle East has nothing to do with geography. It has \r\nto do with the use and misuse of available and potential resources in the \r\nregion. The gap between wealthy and poor nations is wide: the more \r\nprosperous nations enjoy a per capita income 10 times greater than their \r\npoorer neighbours. The earth beneath us will continue to tremble if the \r\nwealthy remain oblivious to the needy, both within and beyond national borders. \r\nThe multilateral negotiations are composed of five areas: economics, \r\narms control, refugees, ecology and water. Progress in these areas will more \r\nlikely be attained if we can restructure the multilateral talks, which \r\ninitially created two advantages: the cluster of issues and the participation \r\nof many Arab countries. But the talks suffer as well from loose organization, \r\nwhich has resulted in seminars rather than negotiations, and from the lack of \r\na concentrated thrust to coordinate their work. We suggest the following \r\nchanges. \r\nFirst, the separate negotiations should be conducted in a coordinated \r\nmanner. \r\nSecondly, participation in the steering committee should be raised to the \r\nministerial level. \r\nThirdly, the multilateral negotiations should be intensified through more \r\nfrequent meetings for longer periods of time. \r\nFourthly, the Syrians and the Lebanese should participate. \r\nFifthly, discussion of human rights and pluralistic values should be made \r\npart of the talks so as to combine the discussion of well-defined practical \r\nissues with the pursuit of common values very much akin to the Helsinki \r\naccords. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n54-55 \r\n(Mr. Peres. Israel) \r\nAnd finally, the parties should agree not to postpone progress in the \r\nmultilateral talks until the conclusion of the bilateral negotiations. Early \r\nplanning can save crucial time for all parties without forcing irreversible \r\ncommitments. And lost time cannot be regained. \r\nThe bilateral negotiations are essentially political. The multilateral \r\nnegotiations are essentially economic. We live in an age when financial \r\nassistance in itself is no longer the answer to the economic needs of the \r\nMiddle East. In the past, belligerency created dependence upon the financial \r\nassistance of other nations. By diminishing the need for arms and building \r\nthe right economic structure, we will be able create wealth of our own. There \r\nis no need to impoverish the wealthy in order to enrich the poor. Opening \r\nborders, paving roads, introducing modern communications, and exchanging \r\ntechnology will generate economic growth in the Middle East. \r\nTrade across borders is essential for economic growth. Markets transcend \r\nnational boundaries. Water, tourism and commerce do not subjugate themselves \r\nto political maps. The Middle East should follow the example of the \"seven \r\ntigers\" in Asia, the European Common Market and the North American Free Trade \r\nAgreement. Let us understand: these regions are our competitors and they are \r\nfar ahead of the Middle East in facing the new realities of the international \r\neconomy. We have to build an open regional economy, for the same reasons and \r\nwith the same promise that led others to do so. We have to build a common \r\nmarket in the Middle East. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n56 \r\n(Mr. Peres. Israel) \r\nWe have to set out upon the long and complicated road to arms control. \r\nThat we can learn from the East-West negotiations and other attempts at arms \r\ncontrol. We have to follow the patient path of confidence-building measures \r\nin the geographical and technical domains until we are able to rid the Middle \r\nEast of the terror presented by weapons of mass destruction, both conventional \r\nand non-conventional. Israel has proposed the creation of a nuclear-free zone \r\nin the Middle East numerous times, and we stand ready to pursue this goal \r\ntoday. \r\nWe should address the problems of refugees, not by threatening to destroy \r\nthe existing demographic balance, but by exploring a range of possibilities \r\nfor restoring the dignity of refugees and offering them a new life. \r\nWe should act to save our fresh air and historic landscape. Ecological \r\npollution does not respect borders, and so we have to marshal forces to save \r\nour region from the danger of uncontrolled deterioration. \r\nFinally, the Middle East possesses vast desert land but meagre water \r\nresources. The land is static, the population is increasing and water \r\nresources are declining. Available water should be reused, and new fresh \r\nwater produced from the sea. Either the land will be salinized by the sea or \r\nthe sea water will be desalinized through available technology. The \r\ntechnology is available, and the necessary credit is attainable. We can \r\nsatisfy the needs of man and land. The Middle East can be made green. It \r\ndepends upon us. \r\nHere, I believe, are the pillars of wisdom for a new Middle East: \r\neconomic growth, arms control, dignity for the refugees, environmental \r\nprotection and water resources, coupled with religious freedom, pluralistic \r\nvalues and human rights. The nations of the Middle East must work \r\nindividually and collectively to meet these challenges of a changed world. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Peres. Israel) \r\nThe agenda is ambitious. Is it merely a dream? No. It is a blueprint, \r\nand the necessary elements are within our grasp. Will these goals be achieved \r\nin our lifetime? We dare not hesitate, because the world will not wait for \r\nthe Middle East. We are tragically late in making peace. If we do not face \r\nour economic challenges, we will be left hopelessly far behind. \r\nThe agenda is new. The vision was already mentioned in Proverbs: \r\n\"Wisdom builds the house. \r\n\"Good judgment makes it secure.\" (The Holy Bible. Proverbs 24:3) \r\n\"Wisdom prevails over strength; knowledge over brute force.\" (The Holy \r\nBible. Proverbs 24:5) \r\nWe have to go to work. For us, the Jewish people, this is Rosh Hashanah, \r\nthe New Year. We pray that the year to come will bring peace, freedom and \r\nprosperity to build a new Middle East for all of its people Muslim, \r\nChristian, Jewish, Arab, Israeli for us, and for our children. \r\nADDRESS BY MR. KENNEDY A. SIMMONDS, PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER OF \r\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS OF SAINT KITTS AND NEVIS \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saint Kitts and Nevis. \r\nMr. Kennedy A. Simmonds. Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Saint Kitts and Nevis, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have great pleasure in welcoming the Prime \r\nMinister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Saint Kitts and Nevis, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kennedy A. Simmonds, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n58 \r\nMr. SIMMONDS (Saint Kitts and Nevis): I bring heartfelt greetings \r\nfrom the Government and friendly people of Saint Kitts and Nevis, and I am \r\nparticularly pleased and, indeed, honoured to be called upon to address the \r\nforty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. \r\nLet me first join those speakers who have preceded me in congratulating \r\nthe former President, Mr. Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, on his efficient and \r\nproficient handling of our past deliberations. Then I must hasten to welcome \r\nour new President, assuring you, Sir, of my country\u0027s active support and \r\ncooperation. Clearly, Mr. President, the very skilful and methodical manner \r\nin which you have been guiding and conducting our work augurs well for a \r\nproductive session. \r\nNext I wish to commend most highly our Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has been serving the cause of our Organization \r\nwith diligence, dignity and dexterity in the face of challenging times. The \r\nGovernment and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis welcome you, \r\nMr. Secretary-General, to this, your first session of the General Assembly as \r\nSecretary-General, and we have every confidence in your commitment to \r\ninternational peace and security as the bases for democracy and development. \r\nWhen we met last year for the Assembly\u0027s forty-sixth session it was in an \r\natmosphere of great optimism. The cold war was over, Kuwait was liberated, \r\nfreedom and democracy were breaking out all over Europe and in the former \r\nSoviet States, positive steps for the reduction of nuclear arms were taking \r\nplace. The world waited with anticipation to reap the benefits of the \r\nall-embracing peace dividend. In my address then I said: \r\n\"The enhancement of education, the eradication of poverty, the \r\nreduction of unemployment, the maintenance of good health, the provision \r\nof affordable housing, the adapting of science and technology to \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n59-60 \r\n(Mr. Simmonds. Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis) \r\nsocio-economic development these must be the dividends that flow from \r\ndiverting global financial resources away from the amassing of armaments, \r\nto be invested in human development. This is the challenge we face. \r\nThis is the new battle we must join and we must not fail.\" \r\n(A/46/PV.25. p. 6) \r\nIt is perhaps too soon to say that we have failed, but we have certainly not \r\nsucceeded. Once again, the attention of the international community has been \r\ndistracted by fierce and despicable atrocities in far-flung theatres of \r\nregional conflict. \r\nOn the one hand, we are shocked by the gruesome and intense savagery of \r\nthe fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The reports of detention camp \r\natrocities, indiscriminate killings, starvation and torture, seem like a \r\nreincarnation of less civilized times, and it is difficult to accept them as \r\npart of the twentieth century. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n61 \r\n(Mr. Simmonds. Saint Kitt-s \r\nand Nevis) \r\nOn the other hand, the scenes of human degradation, suffering and death \r\nfrom starvation and disease emanating from Somalia appear at last to have \r\njolted the conscience of the international community and stimulated a \r\nhumanitarian response to the crisis. \r\nIn these theatres of civil strife, our relief efforts are disrupted by \r\nthose who are seemingly untouched by human suffering. Relief convoys come \r\nunder fire, and food intended for the victims of war is hijacked and ends up \r\nin the coffers of those whose very actions are perpetuating the crisis. \r\nI am aware of the outstanding efforts of the Secretary-General to ensure \r\nthat the United Nations has responded to these crises with urgency and in \r\npositive and practical ways. We must however do more. We must mobilize the \r\nresources, diplomatic and other, of the Member States to bring an end to the \r\nfighting and, secondly, we must continue to intensify the relief effort for \r\nthose in need of the basic necessities of food, shelter and medicines. \r\nIt is serious cause for concern that countries in which the economy is in \r\nshambles, and in which production of goods and services is practically at a \r\nstandstill, can still find the means to procure massive amounts of arms and \r\nammunition and sustain armed conflicts for many months and even years. Here \r\nagain we see resources that should be channelled to address issues of human \r\ndevelopment being diverted into weapons of destruction for the perpetration of \r\nviolence. \r\nIt is therefore clear that there is also an urgent need for a reduction \r\nin both conventional and non-conventional weapons and I call upon the Assembly \r\nto pursue this objective. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Simmonds. Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis) \r\nWhile much of our attention seems to be directed towards Eastern Europe \r\nlet us be reminded that peace and development continue to elude the people of \r\nHaiti and South Africa. \r\nThe people of Haiti still cannot breathe the pure air of freedom; they \r\nstill suffer under an oppressive illegal regime which blatantly and \r\nmonstrously repudiated the will of the people, which was so freely and \r\noverwhelmingly expressed in the elections of December 1990. \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, and indeed the entire Caribbean community, \r\ncontinue to condemn this dastardly assault upon the democratic process in \r\nHaiti, and we maintain our call for the restoration of constitutional \r\ndemocracy in Haiti. I call on the Member States of the United Nations to \r\nostracize the illegal regime in Haiti and to take all appropriate measures to \r\nrestore democracy and the constitutionally elected government in Haiti. \r\nIn the meantime we must continue and increase humanitarian assistance to \r\nthe people of Haiti through international relief organizations, and ensure \r\nthat our assistance reaches those who need it most. We must also be prepared \r\nto mobilize significant development assistance to Haiti when democracy is \r\nrestored. \r\nIn relation to South Africa, we in the Caribbean have been strong in our \r\ncondemnation of apartheid. I have no doubt that our principled stand, along \r\nwith that of other countries has contributed to the eventual dismantling of \r\nthe main pillars of apartheid. Encouraged by the African National Congress, \r\nand as a means of encouraging further progress, we relaxed some of the \r\nsanctions that we had imposed. The recent upsurge in violence, which appears \r\nto enjoy tacit support from elements within the ruling regime itself, must \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. Simmonds. Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis) \r\ncause us to doubt the sincerity of the De Klerk administration to lay \r\napartheid in its final resting place. \r\nThe Government and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis call upon the General \r\nAssembly at this forty-seventh session to condemn the wanton killings in South \r\nAfrica and to appeal to all parties to resume talks in good faith, for the \r\nsake of democracy and good government. We call for an end to the violence in \r\nSouth Africa. We urge the immediate resumption of the negotiating process \r\ntowards a free and democratic South Africa. We re-emphasize our unshakable \r\nsolidarity with the anti-apartheid struggle and we appeal to the South African \r\nregime to exercise more effective control over its security forces. The \r\nclimate for negotiation has to be restored in order to facilitate the \r\nemergence and subsequent establishment of a democratic and non-racial South \r\nAfrica. We seize this opportunity to invite the international community, if \r\nnecessary, to remobilize its forces in the struggle against apartheid, in the \r\nstruggle for freedom, peace and democracy in South Africa. \r\nLet us not abandon the oppressed people in South Africa. Let us stand \r\nfirm instead until justice, equality and freedom become realities. The \r\nprimary objective must be \"one person, one vote\". This is the only brand of \r\ndemocracy we in the Caribbean understand. This is the only brand of democracy \r\nwe want for ourselves and for our brothers and sisters in South Africa. \r\nWe commend the role the United Nations has played and continues to play \r\nin respect of Arab-Israeli relations. We regard the peace talks that have \r\nstarted as a positive development and we urge that they be continued in good \r\nfaith by all parties concerned, so that a just and lasting solution which \r\naddresses all of the issues of fundamental rights, security and economic and \r\nsocial development can be achieved. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n64-65 \r\n(Mr. Simmonds, Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis) \r\nThe people in developing countries are still anxiously awaiting the \r\n\"peace dividend\". This body of nations must work assiduously at bringing an \r\nend to conflicts, at ending hunger and starvation. We must, in short, strive \r\nto move beyond a mere crisis-response modality and shift into a posture to \r\neffect just and sustainable development throughout the world. It is a \r\nmonumental task, which will require massive mobilization of resources, \r\nsensible and sensitive application of those resources, and an unprecedented \r\nlevel of cooperation between developed and developing countries. \r\nThere must be a major emphasis on human resource development so that the \r\npeople may be empowered to drive the development process. In this decade of \r\nthe disabled, and beyond, they too must be involved. My Government is making \r\nevery effort to ensure that the disabled of our country are involved in the \r\ntotal process of mobilization. In order to increase public awareness and to \r\nassist in the development of the disabled, my Government has spearheaded a \r\nmajor fund-raising effort through the annual walkathon undertaken by Ministers \r\nof Government as part of our celebration of independence. We also support \r\ntraining programmes through our own school for the deaf and private sector \r\nsupport institutions. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n66 \r\n(Mr. Simmonds. Saint Kit-tj \r\nand Nevis) \r\nThe people must be given the tools education, basic infrastructure, \r\nappropriate technology transfer and the life-quality-enhancing support of \r\naffordable housing, good health care and facilities for recreation. \r\nInstead of a massive mobilization of financial resources for developing \r\ncountries, however, we are faced with reductions in concessional financing and \r\nacross-the-board cuts in aid. These will hit the poorest and smallest \r\ncountries hardest and undermine our efforts to reduce poverty, stimulate \r\ngrowth and protect the environment. \r\nFree trade is being touted as the new panacea for all our ills. There \r\nis, however, no single prescription for the economic ailments of all \r\ncountries. There is no one solution for the rich and the poor, for the \r\nindustrialized and the non-industrialized, for the developed and the \r\ndeveloping. Even within the category of developing countries, there are \r\nstructural differences between small island developing countries and others. \r\nSpecial consideration must therefore be given to small island developing \r\ncountries. \r\nIn matters of trade we cannot be equal partners. How can we, when large \r\ncountries, having the benefit of economies of scale, highly developed \r\ninfrastructure and modern technology, can swamp our markets with virtually any \r\nproduct? On the other hand, the per capita cost to us of providing the \r\ninfrastructure to support an export-oriented development is higher than it is \r\nin developed countries. \r\nIn the Caribbean we recognize that we must accept the principal \r\nresponsibility for progress in our own development. We have demonstrated a \r\ncommitment to reform and diversification, we have taken bold initiatives \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n67 \r\n(Mr. Simmonds, Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis) \r\ninvolving greater fiscal and economic discipline, and we are willing to do \r\nmore. But we cannot do the job alone. \r\nWe have made significant progress in regional cooperation and are now \r\npoised to take further initiatives to strengthen our functional, economic and \r\npolitical cooperation. We know that we can do more for ourselves through more \r\neffective regional integration. \r\nAs a Caribbean people, we have to be realistic in assessing the potential \r\nimpact of our regional integration process. The members of the international \r\ncommunity too must be realistic in designing their policies for interacting \r\nwith us in the Caribbean community. The fact is that, as developing \r\ncountries most of us being island developing countries in the Caribbean \r\ncommunity we are individually small. When taken together and looked at in \r\nthe international context, we are still small, and the basic problems, \r\ninequities and vulnerabilities of small developing countries still afflict us. \r\nWe want to play an effective part in the international economic system; \r\nwe want to be equal partners in the evolving global trading arrangements. In \r\nour case, however, equal does not mean identical, because we do not start from \r\nthe same premise. The basic conditions and inequities which necessitated \r\nspecial arrangements under agreements such as the Lome Convention, the \r\nCaribbean Basin Initiative and CARIBCAN are still present. Therefore, while \r\nwe support the call for an early and successful conclusion to the Uruguay \r\nRound of trade negotiations, we urge that as we, the small island developing \r\ncountries of the Caribbean, work assiduously to transform our economies, \r\nearnest consideration should be given to the continuation of preferential \r\ntrading arrangements to small countries such as ours. In particular, special \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n68 \r\n(Mr. Simmonds, Saint KiH-g \r\nand Nevis) \r\ntreatment of the sensitive commodities, sugar and bananas, is vital to our \r\nstable adjustment to the changing global economic environment. \r\nThe other area for urgent action is the maintenance of concessional flows \r\nof aid to developing countries. I am aware that global recession and the \r\nrecent uncertainties reflected in the financial system in Europe will put \r\nsevere pressures on donor budgets and will thus encourage the trend towards \r\nthe reduction of official development assistance. I must, in spite of the \r\ndifficulties, renew the call for developed countries to recommit themselves to \r\nreaching the United Nations target for official development assistance \r\namounting to 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product. \r\nA reduction in aid would undermine our efforts to promote sustainable \r\ndevelopment and protect the environment. Yet those objectives were the very \r\nheart of the consensus reached at the historic United Nations Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development the Earth Summit held at Rio de Janeiro in \r\nJune of this year. \r\nThat conference provided us with a rare, almost unique, opportunity for \r\nglobal cooperation and partnership. We paused there to chart afresh the \r\ncourse for improving the quality of life for all peoples in our time and for \r\nfuture generations, through an integrated, caring and people-oriented approach \r\nto sustainable development. We left there with a clear commitment to balance \r\nthe urgency of environmental preservation with the imperatives of human \r\ndevelopment. \r\nWe signed the Convention on biological diversity to encourage the \r\nrational management of natural resources, to ensure that the people of \r\ndeveloping countries will justly gain the benefits associated with the use of \r\ntheir resources. We also signed the Convention on climate change, because \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n69-70 \r\n(Mr. Simmonds. Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis) \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, and indeed the entire Caribbean region, are susceptible \r\nto the ravages of hurricanes, and, as island States, we are certainly \r\nvulnerable to the effects of global warming and a rise in sea level. \r\nThe execution of those Conventions must have special meaning to our women \r\nand children. The United Nations has already committed itself to devoting \r\nspecial attention to them. Saint Kitts and Nevis fully acknowledges the \r\nimportance and contribution of our women to sustainable development. Women in \r\nmy country are fully involved as equal partners in the decision-making and \r\ndevelopment processes. The rights of women and the entitlement to such rights \r\nhave been integrated into my country\u0027s development policies and programmes, \r\nwhich are implemented by a Ministry of Women\u0027s Affairs. We recognize the \r\nstrong correlation between environmentally sound development and population \r\ngrowth, and we provide family-planning programmes involving education, \r\ninformation and accessible services. \r\nWe maintain our commitment to our children through the provision of \r\nimproved educational facilities and appropriate curricula, a variety of \r\ntraining opportunities, recreational facilities, improved housing and a strong \r\nprogramme of primary health care in which we maintain our standard of \r\n100 per cent immunization against the common communicable diseases. \r\nThe importance of our marine environment to the health, welfare and total \r\ndevelopment of our Caribbean people cannot be overemphasized. Consequently \r\nreports of the impending shipment of a large quantity of plutonium through the \r\nCaribbean Sea later this month are a matter of the gravest concern to us in \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis. This is a matter which must and will be addressed by \r\nthe Caribbean community. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n71 \r\n(Mr. Simmonds. Saint Kit-t-̂  \r\nand Nevis) \r\nI call on the international community to support us in our efforts to \r\nprotect our marine environment and to prohibit the movement of hazardous waste \r\nthrough our region. \r\nWe in Saint Kitts and Nevis will continue to play our part in preserving \r\nour planet by implementing national policies and programmes based on domestic \r\nsocial and economic realities, including solid waste management, water quality \r\nimprovement, control of soil and coastal erosion, forestry management, \r\nagricultural and fisheries development and preservation of our marine \r\nenvironment. In Rio, we endorsed an implementation programme known as \r\nAgenda 21. It addresses the major issues related to sustainable development. \r\nIt charts the way to improved living standards in developing countries. We \r\nmust now translate this blueprint into tangible action by providing the \r\nfinancial resources for its implementation. Within the programme, access to \r\nthe resources must not be tied to conditions that would impose further burdens \r\non the people of developing countries. Such resources must be made available \r\non preferential terms, with special concessions for small island developing \r\ncountries. I can stress the urgency of this requirement in no better way than \r\nto repeat what I said to the historic assembly in Rio: \r\n\"We cannot aspire to save the planet for future generations, while \r\nconsigning the poor, the underprivileged, the underdeveloped of this \r\ngeneration to a life of persistent misery and deprivation.\" \r\nThe task *is enormous, the challenge is monumental, but within the \r\ninternational community we have the tools. All that is left is for us to \r\nsummon the commitment to preserve, develop and manage our combined heritage \r\nwith the objective of guaranteeing a better quality of life for all people, \r\neverywhere. \r\nA/47/PV.20 \r\n72 \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saint Kitts and Nevis \r\nfor the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Kennedy A. Simmonds. Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Saint Kitts and Nevis, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\nThe meeting rose at 12.45 p.m. \r\n"
