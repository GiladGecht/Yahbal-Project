NURSULTAN NAZARBAEV, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will first hear an address by the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Kazakhstan. \r\nMr. Nursultan Nazarbaev. President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nursultan Nazarbaev, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\nPresident NAZARBAEV (interpretation from Russian): First, I should \r\nlike to express our profound satisfaction. Sir, at your election to your high \r\npost, and we wish you every success in carrying out your duties as President \r\nof the United Nations General Assembly at its current session. \r\nAt the preceding session the Republic of Kazakhstan was unanimously \r\nadmitted as a Member of the United Nations. On behalf of the people of \r\nKazakhstan, I have the honour to express our deep gratitude for that step and \r\nto declare that the Republic of Kazakhstan, as a peace-loving State, is fully \r\ncapable of fulfilling its obligations, as defined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations, and of making a constructive contribution in all the spheres of \r\nactivity of this authoritative international Organization. \r\nThe current session is no less important for us, since during this \r\nsession the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan has for the first time, \r\nbeen given the opportunity to speak from this rostrum. I take this \r\nopportunity to extend cordial greetings to all the States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations. It would be difficult by now to conceive of the present world \r\norder without the United Nations. The world community places many hopes in \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n3-5 \r\n(President Nazarbaev) \r\nthis unique international organization, chief among them being the formation \r\nof a reliable machinery, reliable stability and security. \r\nThe world has now come close to the threshold beyond which the visible \r\ndisturbing challenges of the future compel us to adopt a new quality of \r\ncoordination, a new way to organize our joint efforts. \r\nWe must clarify what is the essence of this new and as yet unknown \r\nprocess, and we must master it within the context of our whole community, our \r\ncontinent, our region and our own country. These are the aspects on which I \r\nshould like to focus Members\u0027 attention. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n6 \r\n(President Nazarbaev) \r\nThe first aspect relates to the world community itself and the role of \r\nthe United Nations in the world. At this session there has already emerged an \r\nunderstanding of the new realities, which must be defined in a new agenda for \r\nthe entire world. It is no accident that this is the title of \r\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali\u0027s well-known report. We believe that \r\nhis concept of preventive diplomacy is an extremely timely, politically \r\nrational initiative, in the realization of which all members of the world \r\ncommunity should become involved. \r\nIn this connection I regard preventive diplomacy as a system of political \r\nand socio-economic measures designed to prevent hotbeds of potential tension \r\nfrom bursting into flame. An important place in it is occupied by the \r\nconditions which are needed for maintaining social and political stability and \r\nare visible on the surface and by those problems the detection of whose very \r\nexistence requires prognosticatory analysis in depth. \r\nIt is not difficult to understand that the question of borders is a \r\npowder-keg that could explode at any moment, and the explosion usually hurts \r\nnot only those who are playing with fire but also many others who have only a \r\nvery remote connection with the fuse-lighters. In my view, it is obvious that \r\neven one precedent in the revision of currently existing borders would cause a \r\nchain reaction of geopolitical disintegration with unforeseeable consequences. \r\nIn referring to the importance of the principle of the inviolability of \r\nState territory-, I should like to emphasize that the rights of national \r\nminorities today are often thought to be identical with the rights of nations \r\nto self-determination, extending even to the establishment of independent \r\nStates. If we were to hold to such an approach, then, hypothetically \r\nspeaking, thousands of economically weak sovereign States might arise all over \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n7 \r\n(President Nazarbaev) \r\nthe world. Such a situation would be a striking demonstration of turning a \r\nprinciple into a fetish, carrying it to the ultimate absurdity. \r\nI am convinced that the world community, which today guite rightly gives \r\nso much attention to the rights of national minorities, should define clearly \r\nthe criteria for such rights, in order to ensure that human rights and the \r\nrights of nations will triumph on the basis of the triumph of democracy and \r\npeace. Otherwise, under cover of a nation\u0027s right to self-determination, the \r\nintegrity of any national State will be called into question, i.nd the \r\ncorrosive principle of separatism will go on without end. \r\nAt the same time, taking a look forward from the present day to the \r\ntwenty-first century in a search for hotbeds of potential tension, I wish to \r\ndraw the world community\u0027s attention, among other guestions that give cause \r\nfor great concern, to the problem of water in the Central Asian region, which \r\nin time might become a source of dangerous disputes in the very heart of the \r\noldest continent. I am convinced that we need to speed up work now, not \r\nlater, on the preparation of special United Nations projects that would \r\nprovide for a gradual and effective solution to the problem of furnishing \r\nwater resources to Central Asia. \r\nI must point out that the decrease in geopolitical tension along \r\nEast-West lines and the increasingly dangerous confrontation between North and \r\nSouth is a universally recognized fact. However, the emergence and \r\nexacerbation of the second confrontation do not decrease the timeliness of the \r\nfirst. The long-standing complexity of relations between East and West cannot \r\nhe dissipated with the breakup of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. \r\nAccordingly, I believe that the proposed efforts for preventive diplomacy \r\nin establishing, keeping and enhancing the peace should be exerted equally \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n8 \r\n(President Nazarbaev) \r\nalong all the lines of global interaction. I stress this because some \r\ndistortions have already become visible in this connection. United Nations \r\nefforts, to judge from the events of recent months, are predominantly \r\npolitical and military-political in nature. We see more use being made of \r\nprohibitions than of encouragement and incentives. These measures are aimed \r\nat reducing the tensions, visible on the surface, but so far they have not had \r\nany influence on the roots of the conflicts that have arisen and grown. The \r\nreal cause of these conflicts was recently pointed out from this rostrum. The \r\nrichest 20 per cent of the world\u0027s people, in the Northern and Western \r\ncountries, consume 83 per cent of the world\u0027s gross product, and the poorest \r\n20 per cent of the world\u0027s people, in the countries of the South and the East, \r\nonly 1.4 per cent. As we can see, the income of the richest 20 per cent is \r\n60 times that of the poorest 20 per cent. I would call this 60 to 1 ratio the \r\nformula for world ineguality. Until this gap begins to narrow, we shall not \r\nhave a real basis for the comprehensive prevention of conflicts. \r\nI emphasize that, in the final analysis, we are not talking about \r\nredistributing the income of the wealthiest 20 per cent for the benefit of the \r\npoor. The world inequality formula should be changed not by reducing the \r\nincome of the wealthiest 20 per cent but by increasing that of the poorest \r\nthrough organized assistance to help their countries develop. It may be \r\nworthwhile to think about redirecting United Nations efforts towards genuine \r\nconflict prevention and finding the root causes of conflicts. What practical \r\nsteps can be taken in this regard? \r\nI can understand the Secretary-General\u0027s concern over the main problem \r\nthat impedes United Nations peace-keeping efforts the shortage of financial \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n9 \r\n(President Nazarbaev) \r\nresources. It is obvious that United Nations expenditures for the \r\nestablishment, maintenance and enhancement of peace must be increased each \r\nyear. But how can this be done? \r\nAs is well known, until 1992, United Nations expenditures on \r\npeace-keeping totalled approximately US$8.3 billion, not even 1 per cent of \r\ntotal annual defence expenditures in all countries at the end of the last \r\ndecade, which was approximately 1 trillion dollars. \r\nI propose that all countries should, as a demonstration of their good \r\nwill, begin to set up a fund for United Nations peacemaking efforts on the \r\nbasis of the \"one plus one\" formula. This means that each State would begin \r\nto transfer 1 per cent of its defence budget to the fund and would increase \r\nits transfers by the same 1 per cent each year. Thus the amount allocated to \r\npeacemaking in 10 years would increase tenfold. \r\nI think that the national security of every member of the world community \r\nwould be by no means harmed but, on the contrary, actually strengthened by \r\nsuch an action. It is appropriate to recall here the Eastern story which \r\ntells of some people who held a contest of strength. One showed the power of \r\nhis muscles and fists, another found strength in the hardness of his skull, \r\nthe third in his fleetness of foot, the fourth in the sharpness of his \r\ntongue. But a wise man, remembering the heart, without which no strength is \r\npossible, suggested that they should compete in generosity. The generosity of \r\neach country will be what determines the degree to which my proposal is \r\nimplemented a sort of competition for the benefit of the whole world. The \r\nRepublic of Kazakhstan is ready to begin this process immediately. There are. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n10 \r\n(President Nazarbaev) \r\nof course, also other ways that can be provided for States to contribute to \r\nthe fund for United Nations peacemaking efforts. \r\nThe second aspect on which I should like to dwell is the problem of peace \r\nand security in our continent of Asia or, more broadly, in Eurasia. I am \r\nreferring to the initiative put forward by the Republic of Kazakhstan to hold \r\na conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia (CICMA). \r\nThe idea of establishing structures for security and cooperation in Asia of \r\nthe same type as the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) \r\nhas long been in the air but has not yet gained wide support. \r\nThe useful experience of the activities of continental organizations in \r\nthe Americas, in Africa and in Europe should, it would seem, impel Asia as \r\nwell to establish unified bodies for interaction and cooperation. But this is \r\nnot happening, and there are quite a few real reasons for that fact. \r\nPoliticians and analysts critical of the idea of setting up structures for \r\nsecurity and cooperation in Asia often advance the weighty argument that the \r\nlevel of geographical, historical, economic, political social and cultural \r\nheterogeneity among Asian countries is much higher than that among the \r\ncountries of Europe, the Americas, or Africa. Such heterogeneity in economic \r\nand political matters naturally interferes with the action of continental \r\nstructures for collective security. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n11 \r\n(President Nazarbaev) \r\nThis can be countered with a well-known piece of Oriental wisdom: A \r\njourney of a thousand steps starts with the first step. It is by no means \r\nnecessary to move towards a unified Asian structure and collective security in \r\nall these types of interaction at once. It is sufficient to start levelling \r\nout the heterogeneity in one area - for instance, in the military-political or \r\neconomic sphere - and then look for joint approaches in other fields of \r\ncooperation. The move towards such a continental structure could take place \r\nin many steps and on a stage-by-stage basis. For example, it could go from \r\nbilateral relations through regional and continental structures and coalitions \r\nin particular types of cooperation, through the elaboration of \r\nconfidence-building measures and collective security, as well as humanitarian, \r\neconomic and cultural interaction, to common continental bodies for \r\ncooperation on a broad spectrum of problems. \r\nProspects for this process and its main stages might be as follows: \r\nThe first stage would consist of preparatory work to organize and conduct \r\nthe Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia \r\n(CICMA). The approximate time-frame would be 1992 to 1994. \r\nThe second stage would involve accelerating the work of CICMA, increasing \r\nthe number of its members, adapting it to the framework of a Conference on \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Asia (CSCA) and forming pan-Asian structures of \r\nthe CSCE type. The approximate time-frame could be 1994 to 1998. \r\nThe third stage would include defining the development of CSCA, \r\nstrengthening its permanent structures, interaction between CSCE and CSCA and \r\nthe creation of transcontinental bodies in particular areas of cooperation. \r\nThe approximate time-frame would be 1998 to 2000. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n12 \r\n(President Nazarbaev) \r\nThe fourth stage would consist in forming a unified transcontinental \r\nconference on security and cooperation in Eurasia and creating machinery for \r\npermanent interaction between the continental systems of collective security \r\nin Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas, with the further prospect of setting \r\nup a unified global system of collective security and cooperation. The \r\napproximate time-frame would be 2000 to 2005. \r\nWe in Asia live in a remarkable land. All the major religions of the \r\nworld Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity and Islam were born in the sacred \r\nsoil of our continent. All the spiritual teachers of mankind, ranging from \r\nLao-tse and Gautama Buddha, Jesus Christ and Muhammad to the greatest of \r\ncontemporary thinkers, of the calibre of Mahatma Gandhi, were born in our part \r\nof the world. Is it not possible for Asia to absorb everything that has been \r\naccumulated over the ages and synthesize a new concept of continental \r\ncooperation and collective security? \r\nThis position by no means presupposes any regional autarky. We are not \r\ngoing to lock ourselves within continental borders. On the contrary, in the \r\ninterests of Asian countries and peoples, we shall collect the best of what \r\nwas born in other parts of the world. \r\nI am convinced that we must make a collective search for the best way to \r\nmeet the challenges of the future and lay new foundations for mankind\u0027s \r\nexistence in a world more integrated than ever before. Accordingly, I suggest \r\nthat we should convene a special session or a United Nations conference to \r\ndiscuss the problems of the post-confrontation era, for it is the mission of \r\nthe United Nations to play a decisive role in confirming new levels of \r\norganization in the international community. The United Nations itself should \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n13 \r\n(President Nazarbaev) \r\nprobably be reorganized to a certain extent, and this includes the guestion of \r\nthe membership of the Security Council. \r\nThe third aspect, which we cannot fail to mention, concerns the events \r\nthat are taking place in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). \r\nThe fragile structure of our Commonwealth, set up at the end of last \r\nyear, does not yet fully take into account the age-old traditions of \r\ninteraction between States and peoples in this part of Eurasia. As a result, \r\nthe processes of transition to free-market economics and democracy in the CIS \r\nare accompanied by increasing socio-economic and political instability, the \r\nexacerbation of existing conflicts and the emergence of new ones. \r\nKazakhstan is making every possible effort to re-establish a common \r\ncustoms and economic area in a new capacity within the framework of a unified \r\nfree-trade zone. \r\nRealists in the CIS have no illusions as far as the $24 billion of \r\nassistance promised to Russia is concerned. We take a calm view of the \r\nneo-isolationist policy that some of the world\u0027s countries are pursuing \r\ntowards the CIS. We realize that only we ourselves, through our own efforts, \r\ncan stop industrial decline, the severing of economic ties, hyperinflation and \r\nother destructive processes. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that \r\ndespite efforts to strengthen the principles of coordination and the process \r\nof integration, contradictory trends may prevail in the CIS in the immediate \r\nfuture, so that the entire territory of the Commonwealth could turn into an \r\narea of instability and disintegration. I am certain that such a tragic \r\noutcome would not be in the interest of anyone in the world. \r\nIn this connection, I believe that the concept of early conflict \r\ndetection and preventive diplomacy might find direct practical implementation \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n14 \r\n(President Nazarbaey) \r\nin the former Soviet federation. I am referring primarily to strengthening \r\nthe areas of stability that exist in the CIS and then gradually expanding \r\ntheir borders by reducing tensions in the areas of conflict. To that end, I \r\npropose setting up a regional centre, or a United Nations commission, on \r\npreventive diplomacy in Central Asia. The headquarters of the centre could be \r\nlocated at Alma-Ata, the capital of our State. \r\nLastly, I should like to discuss the vitally important issues of ecology \r\nand environmental protection. For Kazakhstan, these issues are embodied in at \r\nleast two areas, the Aral Sea and Semipalatinsk. \r\nThe Aral Sea drying up; it is a zone of ecological catastrophe that \r\ndemands large-scale international emergency assistance. The desertification \r\nof its basin, accompanied by the dissemination of 150 million tons of salty \r\ndust, is causing drastic deterioration of the environment and increasing the \r\nnegative effects on the economy and the health of a vast region with a \r\npopulation of more than 300 million inhabitants. If today this means tragedy \r\nfor tens of thousands of people, tomorrow, without emergency intervention by \r\nthe United Nations, it could mean tragedy for millions. \r\nKazakhstan is grateful for the decision by the leadership of the United \r\nNations Environment Programme (UNEP) to set up an assistance project for \r\ndeveloping a plan to save the Aral Sea and also grateful for the suggestion by \r\na group of UNEP experts that the Aral Sea basin should be declared a zone of \r\nglobal ecological disaster. \r\nThe other severe ecological problem we are suffering from involves the \r\nSemipalatinsk nuclear test site, which was built on Kazakh land against the \r\nwill of our people. The total power of the nuclear warheads that were set off \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n15 \r\n(President Nazarbaev) \r\nhere in the atmosphere, on the ground and underground brought suffering to \r\nmore than half a million people; it is hundreds of times as large as the power \r\nof the devices that brought tragedy to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. \r\nBy a decision of our Government, we have closed down this source of \r\ndeath, but tremendous amounts of resources will be needed to clean up this \r\nregion, to cure those who have suffered and to ensure the safety of the \r\nchildren who will again be born here. The people of Kazakhstan will therefore \r\nneed active international assistance. \r\nToday, on 5 October, we celebrate the anniversary of the creation of the \r\nUnited Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat). Recognizing its \r\nunquestionable importance, Kazakhstan hopes for effective technical and \r\nadvisory assistance from the Centre to our programmes of governmental \r\ndevelopment for urban and rural construction. \r\nThe Kazakh people has a proverb, \"Elu zhylda el zhana,\" which literally \r\nmeans, \"The world becomes new every 50 years\". The first half-century of the \r\nexistence of the United Nations has been marked by confrontation between \r\nsuper-Powers and the burden of opposing military blocs. Now the world \r\ncommunity has a historic opportunity to find in the form of the United Nations \r\nthe means to bring about effective cooperation in the name of peace and \r\nprogress. We must do our utmost to take full advantage of it. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe President of the Republic of Kazakhstan for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Nursultan Nazarbaev. President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n16 \r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued) \r\nGENERAL DEBATE \r\nMr. PURSOO (Grenada): It is with profound pleasure that my \r\ndelegation conveys to the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session the \r\ngreetings and best wishes of the Government and people of Grenada. \r\nWe wish to extend to you. Sir, warm congratulations on your election to \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at this session. My delegation \r\ncommends Mr. Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the excellent \r\nmanner in which he conducted the business of the forty-sixth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\nWe take this opportunity also to extend congratulations to the new \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and to commend him for the \r\nstrong leadership he has brought to the United Nations and for the dedication \r\nwith which he has carried out his duties since assuming office. \r\nThe delegation of Grenada is delighted to welcome to the United Nations \r\nthe 13 new Members: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, \r\nGeorgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, San Marino, \r\nSlovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. \r\nThe current world situation presents a scenario of unmistakable \r\ncomplexities. The end of the cold war, rapid democratization world wide, the \r\nemergence of new national sentiments, intolerance towards ethnic, religious \r\nand cultural differences and the formation of regional economic blocs have \r\nbrought about a restructuring of programmes and a reordering of agendas \r\nlocally, regionally and globally. Economic interests now appear to be given \r\nprecedence in most, if not all, considerations. \r\nThe proponents of those changes declare their objectives to be the \r\ncreation of efficient and competitive production systems, free trade and \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n17 \r\n(Mr. Pursoo. Grenada) \r\nabsolute freedom from control of market forces. But those objectives, though \r\nostensibly neutral, are in fact heavily tilted in favour of the \r\ntechnologically advanced economies and insensitive to the capacities and \r\npriorities of the developing countries. \r\nThat there are other equally important, even primary, objectives to be \r\nachieved by the less developed countries cannot be denied. Indeed, the market \r\neconomy is being perfected, and the time is right for serious responses aimed \r\nat eradicating the conditions of poverty and deprivation that are so \r\nwidespread in the modern world. That process must be activated with the \r\nurgent aim of ensuring that economic progress is buttressed by social equity, \r\nfreedom from want, good health and education and the enjoyment of basic human \r\nrights. Those concerns will no doubt be addressed at the proposed World \r\nSummit for Social Development, which my Government is pleased to support. If \r\nwe fail to develop strategies and programmes to address those problems, then \r\nthe impending conditions of increased hunger, poverty and social deprivation \r\ncan culminate in very serious global unrest and instability. \r\nGrenada is dealing with this new cold economic world at both the domestic \r\nand regional levels. I wish to make it clear that the Government and people \r\nof Grenada recognize and accept that the responsibility for the advancement of \r\nour country rests, first and foremost, sguarely on our shoulders. \r\nGrenada has taken steps to restructure its economy in the face of severe \r\nfiscal deficits, which threatened to erode our credit-worthiness, deny us \r\nspace for growth and development and pauperize our people. Our self-imposed \r\nstructural adjustment programme has its social, political and other costs. \r\nHowever, my Government is convinced that with prudent management of our very \r\nlimited resources, a willingness to sacrifice, firm and cohesive political \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n18-20 \r\n(Mr. Pursoo. Grenada,) \r\nleadership and external assistance, we will in due course restore our economic \r\nwell-being and place our country on a sound growth path. My delegation is \r\nhappy to report that some improvements have already been realized, and we look \r\nforward to achieving all the goals of our structural adjustment programme.* \r\n* Mr. Jesus (Cape Verde), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n21 \r\n(Mr. Pursoo. Grenada) \r\nSmall countries, in particular small developing island countries with all \r\nthe particular difficulties that development presents to them, can hardly \r\ncompete in the world arena with developed countries. While demonstrating our \r\ndetermination to help ourselves, we appeal to donor countries to give renewed \r\nconsideration to the difficulties confronting small developing island \r\ncountries; and we appeal to the international community in general for the \r\nconcessions we need to attain our development goals. \r\nAs we meet at this forty-seventh session of the General Assembly, a \r\nnumber of small island States in the Caribbean, highly dependent on the banana \r\nindustry, are faced with an uncaring call by certain countries to have bananas \r\nplaced within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \r\n(GATT). My delegation submits that the outcome of such a campaign could wipe \r\nout the banana industry in our islands. The resulting social hardships and \r\npolitical instability are costs which will be ruinous to our societies. These \r\nsituations can be avoided if present conditions continue to prevail. Grenada \r\nreiterates is appeal for flexibility on the banana issue and calls upon the \r\npro-tariff lobby to relax its efforts. \r\nAt this particular time in the history of the Caribbean region, we are \r\nseized of the urgency to organize our response to the new international \r\norder. Earlier this year, regional Governments received with pleasure the \r\nreport of the West Indian Commission, which was mandated to examine the \r\nconditions of Caribbean societies and to make recommendations for preparing \r\nthe region for the economic, political and social challenges of the \r\ntwenty-first century. The report of the Commission was very inspiring. It \r\npoints the region along certain beneficial paths, and Grenada looks forward to \r\nthe full consideration of the Commission\u0027s recommendations by Caribbean heads \r\nof Government in the near future. \r\nA / 4 7 / P V . 2 4 \r\n22 \r\n(Mr. P u r s o o . Grenaflal \r\nThe recently concluded United Nations Conference on Environment and \r\nDevelopment (UNCED) heralded a new beginning and was undoubtedly one of the \r\nmost significant undertakings of the United Nations. My Government wishes to \r\napplaud Mr. Maurice Strong and the entire UNCED secretariat for the successful \r\nconclusion of that summit and to extend our congratulations to the Government \r\nof Brazil for successfully hosting the Conference. Its real achievements \r\nshould become manifest over time through the implementation of the work plan \r\non sustainable development. Agenda 21, which comprehensively addressed the \r\ncritical indivisibility of development and concern for the environment. My \r\nGovernment is also pleased with the conventions on climate change and \r\nbiological diversity which were opened for signature at the Rio summit. We \r\nlook forward to an early implementation of both conventions. The Government \r\nof Grenada urges conscientious efforts to establish the mechanisms, strategies \r\nand the resource commitments agreed to. From the perspective of small island \r\nStates in particular, this is an absolute necessity. \r\nOur overriding concern for the welfare of our people and the \r\nwholesomeness of our environment, in particular the fragile marine environment \r\nupon which we are heavily dependent, compels us to register a most vigorous \r\nprotest against the planned shipment of tons of radioactive material through \r\nthe Caribbean Sea later this month. \r\nThe problems of illicit drug trafficking and money-laundering have now \r\nreached levels that no country is able to combat single-handedly. Indeed, the \r\nsecurity and sovereign integrity of our State, the rule of law and the \r\nwell-being of our economic and financial institutions demand that we persevere \r\nin this fight. My Government wishes to take advantage of this occasion to \r\nexpress its appreciation for the efforts undertaken by a number of developed \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n23 \r\n(Mr. Pursoo. Grenada) \r\ncountries to assist developing nations in the campaign against the drug \r\ntrade. We appeal for increased multilateral support to institute \r\ncomprehensive measures aimed at the reduction of demand, interdiction, the \r\nrehabilitation of victims, and appropriate punishment for the couriers of this \r\nparticular form of death and destruction. \r\nIt is distressing to note that, while progress has been made in the \r\npolitical sphere in terms of the peaceful resolution of certain conflicts and \r\nthe abatement of ideological tensions, the nerves of the international \r\ncommunity are being shaken by the situation in the Balkans, most specifically, \r\nby the evidence of what is being described as \"ethnic cleansing\". Recognizing \r\nthat peace and stability are essential to the promotion of social progress, \r\nthe Government of Grenada wishes to reaffirm its support for United Nations \r\nattempts to halt the fighting in Yugoslavia, and we call upon the \r\ninternational community to act in a concerted manner to put a stop to what \r\ncould escalate into a larger and more intractable conflict. \r\nMy Government continues to be keenly interested in the situation in South \r\nAfrica. The persistent violence clearly threatens the negotiating process and \r\ndelays the transition to a democratic South Africa. We are concerned that \r\nwhile strides have been made to dismantle the pillars of apartheid, greater \r\nefforts must be made to accelerate the pace of reforms, so as to enhance the \r\nclimate for free political activity and genuine democracy. The Government of \r\nGrenada therefore welcomes recent positive signals pointing to the resumption \r\nof dialogue between the African National Congress and the Government of South \r\nAfrica. \r\nMy Government also welcomes the peace talks currently taking place among \r\nthe key parties to the Middle East conflict and wishes to counsel continued \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n24-25 \r\n(Mr. Pursoo. Crenel \r\ndialogue and flexibility in order to bring lasting solutions to that region\u0027s \r\nproblems. \r\nOver the last year, numerous initiatives to reinstate ousted Haitian \r\nPresident Jean Bertrand Aristide have been frustrated. Sanctions announced by \r\nthe Organization of American States have not produced the anticipated results \r\nbecause of the evident unwillingness of some countries to enforce the \r\nmeasures. My Government wishes to reiterate its support for the return to \r\npower of the constitutionally elected Government of Haiti and calls upon the \r\ninternational community to continue to support the restoration of Haiti\u0027s \r\ndemocracy. \r\nThe international community is now reasonably expecting greater United \r\nNations involvement in the maintenance of global peace and security. At the \r\nsame time, more attention and resources are expected to be focused on the \r\neconomic, social, cultural and humanitarian needs of the developing \r\ncountries. My delegation wishes to encourage greater efforts to realize the \r\nbenefits of peace dividends and to channel them towards those needs. \r\nThe Government of Grenada is cognizant of the challenging efforts at \r\nrevitalization being undertaken throughout the United Nations system so as to \r\nincrease efficiency and cost-effectiveness. We anticipate that this \r\nrevitalization will emphasize the priorities of the countries most in need \r\nthe developing countries. We are convinced that the regional economic \r\ncommissions are in a good position to deal with a wide range of development \r\nissues and should thus be given greater autonomy in the implementation of \r\nregional programmes. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n26 \r\n(Mr. Pursoo. Grenada) \r\nThe financial difficulties confronting the United Nations are of deep \r\nconcern to Grenada, as I am sure they are to many Member States. We recognize \r\nthe importance of a financially strong United Nations with the capacity to \r\ndeal effectively with problems of an economic, social, cultural or \r\nhumanitarian character, to promote peace, security, respect for human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms. At the same time, it is true that many Governments \r\nare experiencing severe difficulties in meeting their primary financial \r\nobligations. It is hardly the time for additional commitments due to reckless \r\ncauses and senseless conflicts. \r\nAs we approach the end of the International Decade of Disabled Persons, \r\nwe must acknowledge that too little has been done to enable disabled persons \r\nto see themselves as equal citizens. In this regard my Government takes this \r\nopportunity to encourage measures aimed at enhancing the fuller participation \r\nand welfare of didsabled persons in their respective societies. \r\nDespite the tremendous amount of work to be done in order to build and \r\nconsolidate democracy and improve the standard of living for peoples \r\neverywhere, Grenada believe that, with the collective efforts of all States \r\nand the purposeful involvement of the United Nations, our aspirations will be \r\nachieved. \r\nMr. SIPASEUTH (Lao People\u0027s Democratic Republic) (spoke in Lao; \r\ninterpretation from French text furnished by the delegation): Mr. President, \r\non behalf of the delegation of the Lao People\u0027s Democratic Republic, I wish to \r\ncongratulate you on your election to the presidency of the forty-seventh \r\nsession of the General Assembly. I am convinced that you will brilliantly \r\nfulfil the important mission conferred upon you by the Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n27 \r\n(Mr. Sipaseuth. Lao People\u0027s \r\nDemocratic Republic) \r\nI also wish to express sincerest congratulations to the \r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has assumed \r\nhis office and high responsibilities at a time when the world situation \r\nrequires that the United Nations play an important role. \r\nWe cannot miss this opportunity to pay a special tribute to his \r\npredecessor. His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his active \r\ncontribution to the defence of our Organization\u0027s cause. \r\nWe warmly welcome the presence among us of new Members: the Republic of \r\nArmenia, the Azerbaijani Republic, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the \r\nRepublic of Croatia, the Republic of Georgia, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the \r\nRepublic of Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, the Republic of San Marino, \r\nthe Republic of Slovenia, the Republic of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and the \r\nRepublic of Uzbekistan. Their admission is an important step towards the \r\nuniversality of our Organization. \r\nThe global situation is in a state of profound change, both complex and \r\nfull of new promise. With the breakup of the Eastern bloc, military and \r\nnuclear confrontation have progressively waned. None the less, numerous civil \r\nconflicts, ethnic struggles, religious clashes and border conflicts continue \r\nto disturb many countries of the world, thus seriously threatening \r\ninternational peace, stability and security. \r\nAll of this not withdstanding, it must be noted that the world climate is \r\nevolving towards co-operation, development and the settlement of global \r\nproblems, including those related to poverty, to misery and to the environment. \r\nIn the changing world in which the new international order is beginning \r\nto take shape, the United Nations must play a central role in the collective \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n28 \r\n(Mr. Sipaseuth. Lao People\u0027s \r\nDemocratic Republic) \r\neffort to define this new order, which should respond equitably to the rights \r\nand interests of all countries and peoples without discrimination and must be \r\nbased on the principles of peaceful coexistence and those of the United \r\nNations Charter. It is therefore necessary to revitalize, restructure and \r\ndemocratize the United Nations if we want the Organization to be capable of \r\nthe tasks that lie ahead in this new era. \r\nWe are still in an uncertain world characterized by many problems and \r\nconflicts in different regions. \r\nIn Europe, the situation prevailing in former Yugoslavia continues to \r\ndeteriorate dangerously. It is a major source of concern for the \r\ninternational community, as well as a threat to regional and global peace and \r\nsecurity. The international community must take appropriate measures to put \r\nan end to that ethnic conflict in order to restore peace, security and normal \r\nlife to that part of the world. \r\nIn South Africa, despite certain political reforms the foundations of the \r\napartheid system remain intact. The Pretoria regime continues to resort to \r\nviolence to repress the black population, while the African National Congress \r\nof South Africa (ANC) is forcefully and constructively pursuing its struggle \r\nfor the triumph of its just cause. The Lao Government fully associates itself \r\nwith the international community in its efforts to support the struggle of the \r\ngreat majority of that people in order to make South Africa a democratic and \r\nnon-racial country. \r\nIn the Middle East, the situation remains tense and precarious. Israel \r\nis perpetuating its occupation of Palestinian territory and of the other Arab \r\nterritories. We reaffirm the view that every effort for peace now under way \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n29-30 \r\n(Mr. Sipaseuth. Lao People\u0027s \r\nDemocratic Republic) \r\nwith a view to a just, comprehensive and lasting solution in the Middle East, \r\nat the heart of which is the question of Palestine, should work towards rapid \r\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and \r\nthe other resolutions of the United Nations calling for Israel\u0027s withdrawal \r\nfrom all occupied Arab lands, as well as recognition of the Palestinian \r\npeople\u0027s right to self-determination. \r\nIn the Persian Gulf, following the end of the war peace and security have \r\nnot yet been established because of threats of and attempts at further \r\nhostilities. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n31 \r\n(Mr. Sipaseuth. Lao People\u0027s \r\nDemocratic Republic) \r\nIn Western Asia, Afghanistan remains a theatre of civil war. The \r\ninternational community must appeal to all the parties concerned to put an \r\nimmediate end to their conflicts in order to achieve national harmony among \r\nAfghans and to establish political, economic and social stability. \r\nIn the Korean peninsula, the signing of the North-South Accord on \r\nReconciliation, Non-Aggression and Exchanges and the Joint Declaration on the \r\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula by the Democratic People\u0027s Republic \r\nof Korea and the Republic of Korea has contributed to promoting mutual \r\nunderstanding and trust. It has opened up a new prospect for peace, stability \r\nand cooperation in the Korean peninsula and strengthened peace and security in \r\nthe North-East Asian region and in the rest of the world. \r\nIn the South-East Asian region, in spite of certain factors of \r\ninstability, the situation as a whole is moving towards peace, stability, \r\ncooperation and development in the interest of the peoples of the entire \r\nregion. In this context, inspired by the desire to strengthen relations of \r\nfriendship and cooperation with neighbouring countries, the Lao Government, \r\napplying its consistent foreign policy based on the five principles of \r\npeaceful coexistence, signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation with the \r\nKingdom of Thailand, became a party to the Treaty of Bali of 1976. It has \r\nj \r\nalso become an Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) observer. It \r\nwill continue to work firmly for fruitful cooperation in South-East Asia, with \r\na view to promoting the progress and prosperity of the region, thus \r\ncontributing to promoting peace and development the world over. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n32 \r\n(Mr. Sipaseuth. Lao People\u0027s \r\nDemocratic Republic) \r\nAs regards the question of Cambodia, the signing of the Paris Agreements \r\nof 23 October 1991 laid the foundations for a comprehensive political \r\nsettlement to the conflict, making it possible to put an end to the suffering \r\nendured by the Cambodian people during a long period of civil war and to \r\nestablish peace and tranguillity in the noble land of Angkor. Complete \r\ncompliance with, and implementation of, these Agreements is required to meet \r\nthe aspirations and the interests of the Cambodian people. \r\nIn my own country, the implementation of our policy of renewal has led to \r\nimportant successes. Political stability and social order are solidly \r\nguaranteed. Democracy and the right of collective decision-making by the \r\npeople have developed steadily in accordance with our level of economic and \r\nsocial development and the customs of the country. The adoption last year by \r\nthe National Assembly of the first Constitution of the Republic makes it \r\npossible for our country to move progressively towards a State of law. In the \r\nframework of that policy we are focusing all our efforts on freeing the \r\ncountry of underdevelopment. To this end we have encouraged foreign \r\ninvestment, intensified cooperation with other countries and taken advantage \r\nof all economic sectors employing market-economy mechanisms in order to tap \r\nall our national potential and to improve the physical and spiritual living \r\nconditions of our people. \r\nThe world economy is in a state of uncertainty. Last year it experienced \r\nthe first global recession since the 1940s. Moreover, the recovery remains \r\nweak and precarious. The developing countries continue to suffer from \r\ncoercive economic policies and practices. The stifling burden of foreign \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n33 \r\n(Mr. Sipaseuth. Lao People\u0027s \r\nDemocratic Republic) \r\ndebt, the decline in resources allocated to development, the deterioration of \r\nthe terms of trade, the worsening of the outflow of capital, the drop in \r\ncommodity prices, the rise in protectionism and limited access to modern \r\ntechnology all obstruct their economic progress at a time when reforms and \r\nreadjustments are under way. Since the world economy is a single entity whose \r\ncomponents are interdependent and interrelated, it is urgently necessary \r\nindeed, crucial to develop a new world consensus and to obtain a commitment \r\nto the strengthening of international cooperation, and in particular the \r\nrevitalization of the economic growth and development of the developing \r\ncountries, in order successfully to implement the economic strategy of the \r\nFourth United Nations Development Decade, 1991-2000. \r\nOne of the most important issues related to development is that of the \r\nenvironment, which is at the forefront of our international concerns. Climate \r\nchange, air, sea and ocean pollution, desertification and the depletion of the \r\nozone layer have all had a negative impact on our lives and on the future of \r\nmankind. In this respect, we believe that the recent United Nations \r\nConference on Environment and Development, which was held in Rio de Janeiro, \r\nlaid the foundations of international agreement on cooperation aimed at \r\nintegrating the environment into all development activities. It will \r\ntherefore be up to the United Nations and its specialized agencies to \r\nimplement effectively Agenda 21. \r\nAt the same time, the aspirations of the international community to a \r\nbetter guality of life and social progress have become more pressing and \r\nincreasingly important. In fact, protection of the environment, promotion \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n34-35 \r\n(Mr. Sipaseuth. Lao People\u0027s \r\nDemocratic Republic) \r\nof economic growth and development, and the eradication of poverty are \r\nmutually reinforcing and require a new global partnership. In this framework, \r\nwe are awaiting with interest the planned convening of the World Summit for \r\nSocial Development. \r\nThe problem of the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs remains a source of \r\nglobal concern. The struggle against this scourge requires concerted, strong \r\naction by all countries. For its part, in order to contribute to the \r\ninternational effort the Lao Government has cooperated in the sphere of \r\nintegrated rural development with certain interested countries, especially \r\nneighbouring countries, as well as with international organizations, including \r\nthe United Nations International Drug Control Programme, and we are prepared \r\nto continue this cooperation. \r\nIn conclusion, the Lao delegation wishes to assure the President, \r\nMr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, of its complete cooperation. We will work in a \r\nconstructive spirit with other delegations to contribute to the success of \r\nthis session of the General Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n36 \r\nMr. HURST (Antigua and Barbuda): Exactly 500 years ago, in 1492, \r\ntwo worlds collided. That collision completely altered the fate of human \r\ncivilization and the destinies of the two peoples involved. One people \r\nachieved ascending heights; the other virtually disappeared. What remains of \r\nthe indigenous populations of the Caribbean, or much of the \"new world\", \r\nserves as a measurement of man\u0027s ability to be brutish in the pursuit of \r\nwealth. My Caribbean island country has been more than a witness of change in \r\nthe 500-year decline, transformation and recreation of the region. From \r\nconquest through slavery, from colonial hegemony to political independence, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda has been a maker of history in the Caribbean and, indeed, \r\nin the larger region. \r\nIn 1992, however, our country stands, with the rest of the world, on the \r\nthreshold of yet another momentous collision. This time the collision is \r\nbetween human civilization and nature; this time there are no ascending \r\nheights; this time humanity itself could disappear. \r\nFor 500 years, from Columbus to Rio, our forests and our oceans, our air \r\nand our lands - the Earth\u0027s gifts to humanity have been wrongly regarded as \r\ninexhaustible and unchanging. \"If Columbus uncovered our Earth\u0027s expanse, Rio \r\nrevealed its limits.\" Humanity, all agree, cannot march along on its present \r\ncourse for another 500 years. In fact, humanity cannot proceed with business \r\nas usual for even another 100 years. Island countries, like my own and others \r\nin the Caribbean and in the Pacific, stand in real danger of being submerged \r\nby swollen oceans. Moreover, global warming, insidious climate change, \r\nozone-layer depletion, the loss of forests and other dangers threaten \r\nhumanity\u0027s very existence. \r\nDramatic changes in the systems of production, distribution and disposal \r\nare required of the industrialized countries if we are to save ourselves. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Hurst. Antigua and \r\nBarbuda) \r\nDeveloped countries cannot consume the Earth\u0027s resources at current rates; \r\ndeveloping countries cannot be made to languish in the dusty exhaust of \r\nrapidly accelerating technological societies. Sustainable development that \r\ntakes account of environmental costs must begin to guide humanity\u0027s \r\ntechnological future. Only the United Nations and its General Assembly can \r\nconstruct the new world which, in Rio, this family of nations agreed to \r\ncommence building immediately. \r\nIt is thus fitting that, in 1992, a representative of Bulgaria has been \r\nselected to preside over the General Assembly at its forth-seventh session. \r\nHis nation is taking part in a great regional experiment, the outcome of which \r\nis sure to influence the course of human civilization worldwide. Antigua and \r\nBarbuda hails Bulgaria for its courage, and I pledge the full support of my \r\ndelegation for the President throughout the forty-seventh session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\nPermit me to applaud the outgoing President, Mr. Samir Shihabi of Saudi \r\nArabia, for his unfailing efforts to bring reform to the United Nations and \r\nfor his diligence during Saudi Arabia\u0027s year-long tenure. This community owes \r\nMr. Shihabi a debt that can be repaid only through a continuous effort to \r\nstrengthen the General Assembly during the coming years. We must focus our \r\nefforts on economic, social and humanitarian matters with no less vigour than \r\nis currently directed at political and security concerns. Antigua and Barbuda \r\ncan be relied upon to promote the multilateral approach to problem solving, \r\nconfident that multilateralism will always prove to be superior. \r\nIn that regard, it may be recalled that when we commenced the forty-sixth \r\nsession of the General Assembly one year ago Haiti was free. The first \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n38 \r\n(Mr. Hurst. Antigua and \r\nBarbuda) \r\ndemocratically elected President of Haiti stood at this podium. The United \r\nNations had contributed to the ending of tyranny in the Caribbean\u0027s oldest but \r\npoorest Republic, and all delegations celebrated with President Aristide. \r\nTen days after President Aristide\"s triumphant declaration in this Hall, \r\ntyranny once again raised its ugly head in our sister Caribbean isle. The \r\nmilitary plotters who brutally seized power in Haiti one year ago are still on \r\ntheir perch. But this Assembly will never rest until democracy is restored \r\nand Haiti\u0027s people are again free. \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, working within the framework established by the \r\nOrganization of American States, will continue to press for the expansion of \r\nsanctions in order to isolate further the military regime in Haiti and to \r\nreturn Haiti to democracy. If we do not succeed quickly in Haiti, the United \r\nNations will risk tarnishing its well-earned reputation for being able to \r\ntackle exceedingly complex problems in extremely violent situations in other \r\ncorners of the globe. \r\nIn South Africa, for example. United Nations sanctions have assisted in \r\nbringing the apartheid regime to the negotiating table. It was 46 years ago, \r\nin 1946, that India brought the question of apartheid in South Africa to the \r\nattention of the United Nations; today, 179 Member States are anxious to see \r\nlegalized racism exorcized from the body politic. \r\nTwelve weeks ago, when the Security Council convened to seek a solution \r\nto the violence in South Africa, my delegation gave notice to the racist \r\nregime that any attempt on its part to delay the establishment of democracy in \r\nSouth Africa by fomenting violence would cause us to press for the \r\nreintroduction of the sanctions that had been relaxed. We repeat our pledge \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n39-40 \r\n(Mr. Hurst. Antigua and \r\nBarbuda) \r\ntoday. While they praise the courage of those who have entered into \r\nconstitutional talks, my countrymen will never lose sight of the fact that \r\napartheid is an evil whose demise the world\u0027s peoples eagerly await. Until \r\napartheid is eliminated. South Africa will continue to be excluded from this \r\nfamily of nations. \r\nAntigua and Barbuda takes this opportunity to welcome to our family the \r\n12 newly independent nations that have emerged with the end of the cold war \r\nand the collapse of an empire. Island countries in the Caribbean gained their \r\nindependence, beginning 30 years ago, during the decline of another empire. \r\nIt is thus with a shared sense of exhilaration that we welcome Armenia, \r\nAzerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, \r\nthe Republic of Moldova, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to \r\nmembership of the United Nations. It may be too late to caution our new \r\nMembers to avoid the pitfalls of fierce nationalism and unharnessed ethnic \r\nrivalry. Both inevitably lead to fractious and violent turmoil, which, we \r\nknow, surely end without victors. All multiracial and multi-ethnic societies \r\nmust learn to settle historic and current differences peacefully. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n41 \r\n(Mr. Hurst. Antigua and \r\nBarbuda) \r\nNotwithstanding the domestic discord which may obtain following the \r\narrival of independence, small nations which dwell in the geopolitical shadow \r\nof a giant must be forever diligent in protecting their sovereignty. The \r\nUnited Nations, fostering as it does respect for international law, remains \r\nthe most certain guarantor of a small nation\u0027s independence. \r\nKnowing the importance of the United Nations, therefore, we work towards \r\nfashioning a system which responds favourably to the interests of even the \r\nleast among equals. Our world parliament cannot become, and must not ever \r\nappear to have become, the handmaiden of a few powerful Member States. The \r\nintegrity of the United Nations lies in the ability of even its smallest \r\nMember to participate meaningfully in shaping United Nations policy. \r\nAntigua and Barbuda thus welcomes San Marino to membership in this our \r\nfamily of nations. As our smallest Member State, San Marino bears a special \r\nresponsibility to pronounce on the responsiveness of the United Nations to the \r\ninitiatives of the less powerful. Antigua and Barbuda pledges its fullest \r\nco-operation with the delegation of San Marino, now and in the future. \r\nWe also congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, on \r\ndemonstrating a willingness to speak boldly concerning matters to which \r\ninsufficient attention has been paid. United Nations leadership must chart a \r\ncourse which promotes peace, justice and freedom wherever these cherished \r\nhuman values are in danger of disappearing. \r\nThe danger to cherished human values is also manifested in \r\nunderdevelopment. Island developing countries, and other small countries, \r\nmust look increasingly to the multilateral institutions for varied assistance \r\nin finding solutions to vexing problems. The United Nations system cannot \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Hurst. Antigua and \r\nBarbuda) \r\nreduce its economic and social development roles without adversely affecting \r\nprevailing material conditions. \r\nNotwithstanding this admonition, our experience confirms that development \r\nis also greatly influenced by good governance and the intelligent use of \r\nscarce resources, including investment capital. While we have relied and will \r\ncontinue to rely on ourselves to provide good governance, our investment \r\ncapital has to be imported. Our small size, however, puts us at the mercy of \r\nthe major capital markets, over which Antigua and Barbuda, like other small \r\ncountries, exercises not one iota of control. The United Nations, aware of \r\nthe special disadvantages that are inherent in the small island developing \r\ncountry, must respond in a manner which appropriately reflects these \r\ncircumstances. \r\nMy delegation thus takes this opportunity to commend highly the United \r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP). Its funding of, and support for, a \r\nnumber of beneficial projects within my region earns it great applause. \r\nHowever, we continue to object to the use of the per capita gross national \r\nproduct (GNP) device for determining development status and funding \r\neligibility of small island countries. For large countries, the device is \r\nperfect. It was devised with large countries in mind. But when applied to a \r\nsmall island country, the per capita GNP device results in a distortion. \r\nThe measurement device fails to take into account the much higher cost \r\nper person which small populations incur for routine services that are \r\nprovided at minimal cost to large populations, even large populations in poor \r\ncountries. It fails to reflect the inherent inability of our embryonic \r\nmanufacturing industries to penetrate major markets because their production \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n43 \r\n(Mr. Hurst. Antioua and \r\nBarbuda) \r\nlevels reflect small size. It fails to reward good governance and sacrifice, \r\npreferring instead to believe the fiction that a well-run small island \r\ndeveloping country has graduated, is developed and, hence, in need of no \r\nassistance because a distorted per capita GNP device so determines. We are \r\nflattered to be regarded as developed, but that characterization is \r\ninaccurate. We reject the per capita GNP device and therefore call for the \r\nuse of more reliable indicators when assistance to small island developing \r\ncountries is contemplated. \r\nIn projects relating to improvement of the environment, small island \r\ndeveloping countries have been successful in persuading their larger partners \r\nto accept the fact that their unique vulnerabilities require special \r\nconsideration. In this regard, Antigua and Barbuda, in its country report to \r\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), \r\nidentified high-priority areas pertaining to its heritage resources that \r\nrequire special assistance. It is our hope that the UNDP and its capacity 21 \r\nfunding mechanism will be persuaded to acknowledge our special needs. \r\nAntigua and Barbuda applauds the United Nations Development Fund for \r\nWomen (UNIFEM) for its very compelling promotion of the rights of women. It \r\ntakes no special effort for my small island developing country to recognize \r\nthat successful development requires the unhindered contribution of every \r\nable-bodied adult, regardless of gender. The elimination of de facto \r\ndiscrimination against women is therefore of paramount importance in my \r\ncountry and my region. UNIFEM, an active partner in the development process, \r\ncan rely upon Antigua and Barbuda\u0027s solid commitment to its universal \r\nobjective of empowering women in order to strengthen development and to ensure \r\nthat justice is gender-blind. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n44 \r\n(Mr. Hurst. Antigua nffij \r\nBarbuda) \r\nThe injustices heaped upon the heads of the world\u0027s indigenous peoples \r\nmust also quickly cease. To that end, the United Nations has declared 1993 \r\nthe International Year for the World\u0027s Indigenous People. In December 1993 \r\nprogress made will be measured by deeds, not words. National legislation and \r\nfunded projects which are intended to ensure the continued survival of the \r\nindigenous peoples that inhabit remote corners of the Earth must be in place. \r\nHaving lost the indigenous Arawaks and Caribs of Antigua and Barbuda beginning \r\nin 1492, my country is duty-bound to ensure that powerless indigenous people \r\nwho have inhabited the lands of their ancestors for many millennia are \r\nadequately protected by the United Nations. \r\nEach year, Antigua and Barbuda brings to the attention of the Assembly \r\nthe state of affairs prevailing on Earth\u0027s last uninhabited continent \r\nAntarctica. Last year, we applauded when the 26 voting members of the \r\nAntarctic Treaty Consultative Parties entered into a binding agreement \r\nforbidding mining and oil exploration on Antarctica for 50 years, until the \r\nyear 2040. Although the agreement successfully curbs this generation\u0027s \r\ncupidity, we believe that Antarctica must never become the possession of large \r\nStates only. Transforming Antarctica into a world park or protected area \r\nunder the umbrella of United Nations control would be a more certain guarantee \r\nof its preservation. \r\nDuring the past year, more human beings died of starvation and violence \r\nin Somalia than the entire population of my country. Tens of thousands more \r\nwill die in the coming months by self-inflicted violence complicated by the \r\nravages of nature. The United Nations, recognizing the desperation of \r\nSomalia\u0027s 4.5 million people, must further increase its efforts to find a \r\nsolution to the crisis. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n45 \r\n(Mr. Hurst. Antigua and \r\nBarbuda) \r\nOn the question of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the United Nations has spared \r\nno effort to end the crisis. The European Community is apparently determined \r\nthat some crises require more than a regional response. Those of us from \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean, whose regional organization has addressed the \r\nintractable question of Haiti with little success, have the benefit of the \r\nEuropean experience as a guide. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n46 \r\n(Mr. Hurst. Antigua and \r\nBarbuda) \r\nMy country rejoices with the Central American countries as peace blankets \r\ntheir region. The sound of working hands has replaced the sound of working \r\nguns, we are told. If future civil war is to be prevented, however, the \r\neconomic systems which prevail in Central America must become far more \r\ninclusive: the sharing of wealth must result in more than a trickle going to \r\nthe poor. \r\nThe trickling flow of peace in the Middle East is most heart-warming. \r\nAntigua and Barbuda applauds the Israelis and the Palestinians for finally \r\nsitting down together and negotiating their future. It is our hope that, \r\nsoon, Israel will be allowed to exist within secure and accepted borders and \r\nthat the Palestinians will have a sovereign State of their own. \r\nWe rejoice at the wave of peace which has engulfed Lebanon. Despite the \r\nunresolved problems, which the electoral system has attempted to address, \r\nLebanon is facing the future with a certainty of peace that has eluded it for \r\nmore than a decade. A land as beautiful, as culturally diverse and as full of \r\nso many warm people as is Lebanon must pledge to enter the twenty-first \r\ncentury at peace with itself. \r\nMy delegation concludes by recalling that the modern history of our \r\npeaceful Caribbean began 500 years ago when another world collided with it. \r\nThe pursuit of accumulated wealth which propelled one world towards the other \r\nremains the motive force of the dominant civilization of today. Yet, complex \r\nwebs have been weaved into this underlying theme, which even a small country, \r\na small place, like mine can take credit in reshaping. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Hurst. Antioua and \r\nBarbuda) \r\nFor example, on 3 October 1736, exactly 256 years ago this year, an \r\nunsuccessful slave revolution took place in Antigua. The leaders of that \r\nrevolution are the heroes of the freedom-loving people of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda. In 1736, our heroes attempted to destroy a wicked system which \r\nguaranteed the most certain accumulation of wealth at the expense of human \r\nmisery. By our own choosing, therefore, Antiguans and Barbudans of today, the \r\ndescendants of those slaves and those slave-masters, have declared that in our \r\nhierarchy of values freedom is superior to all else. \r\nIn 1992, the human being, not wealth accumulation, is at the centre of \r\ndevelopment and civilization. Yet, our countries are now engaged in a great \r\ndebate about the future, and the United Nations General Assembly is the \r\nplatform. The importance of keeping the entire United Nations system from \r\nbecoming homogenized in its thinking is most important at a time when the \r\nemerging new world order is being shaped increasingly by a single Power. \r\nOur task is not merely to express a differing point of view, but to \r\ndemonstrate in a concrete manner that the raison d\u0027etre of the civilization of \r\nthe next 500 years has not yet been decided. In fact, given the threat to the \r\nvery existence of small islands from rising sea levels, violent hurricanes, \r\nhazardous-waste disposal and other looming environmental calamities, the \r\nburden of defining the future may very likely fall upon the thinkers and \r\nactors from these most vulnerable, small countries. \r\nIndeed, our Prime Minister, the Right Honourable V. C. Bird, has \r\nfrequently said that small size does not mean small minds or the absence of \r\ngrand ideas. And so, my countrymen and I, having learned well the lessons of \r\nour history, shall continue to do all in our power at this United Nations and \r\nelsewhere to influence the future. We shall rely upon our collective wisdom. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n48 \r\n(Mr. Hurst. Antioua and \r\nBarbuda) \r\nthe strength of our institutions, the vitality of our youth, and the will of \r\nour leadership to exercise that influence. Our very existence reguires \r\nsuccess; and so we shall succeed. \r\nMr. TOURE (Guinea-Bissau) (interpretation from French): On behalf \r\nof my country and Government, I should like first of all to convey our \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency of the United \r\nNations General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. His competence and the \r\nwealth of experience he has acquired during his career as a diplomat in the \r\nservice of his country, Bulgaria which enjoys great prestige on the \r\ninternational scene constitute, for the members of the Assembly, a sure \r\nguarantee for the success of our work. \r\nMy delegation particularly welcomes this choice of President because our \r\ntwo countries have good relations, which are marked, among other things, by \r\nthe massive assistance which his country gave to the heroic liberation \r\nstruggle of our people and of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea \r\nand Cape Verde (PAIGC) against colonialism. Because of this, I should like \r\nhere and now to assure him of my delegation\u0027s cooperation in carrying out the \r\nlofty mission the Assembly has just entrusted to him. \r\nMy delegation offers its congratulations and expresses its gratitude to \r\nMr. Samir Shihabi, who, with great talent, wisdom and efficiency, guided the \r\nwork of the forty-sixth session. We wish him every success in his future \r\nendeavours. \r\nOur congratulations and our thanks also go to the Secretary-General of \r\nthe United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his tireless, constant, \r\nclear-sighted and successful efforts to safeguard peace and security the world \r\nover. We also pay tribute to the Secretary-General\u0027s dedication, to his \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n49-50 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Guinea-Bissau) \r\nvisionary ability and his capacity to act, and, particularly, to his concern \r\nfor preserving the prestige and the effectiveness of the United Nations in all \r\ncircumstances. \r\nTo his predecessor, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, who worked relentlessly for the \r\nrenewal of the United Nations system, the establishment of international peace \r\nand security and development, we extend all our congratulations and a ringing \r\ntribute for the work he accomplished in the service of the international \r\ncommunity. We wish him also every success in his future endeavours. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Guinea-Bissau) \r\nThe admission of new Members is an important stage in attaining the \r\nuniversality of the Organization, thereby enabling it to undertake greater \r\naction and giving it greater dynamism to achieve its objectives. That is why \r\nthe Republic of Guinea-Bissau welcomes with joy the new Members that have \r\njoined our great family since the forty-sixth session. The delegation of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau congratulates all those countries. \r\nThe forty-seventh session is being held at a time when international \r\nrelations have been given a new momentum for progress and dynamism; and this, \r\nthanks to far-reaching changes taking place in the world. \r\nThe Secretary-General, at the request of the Security Council, has \r\nsubmitted to us a report entitled, \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277), in which \r\nhe refers quite rightly to the concept of preventive diplomacy and the idea of \r\nthe maintenance, strengthening and consolidation of peace throughout the \r\nworld. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau supports these initiatives. \r\nThis new dynamic which today characterizes international relations, \r\nhenceforth freed from the cold war, is a source of great hope for stability \r\nand opens up prospects for peace, understanding and cooperation which have \r\nenabled the United Nations to help in taking concrete initiatives for settling \r\nmany conflicts. \r\nYes, the world today has undergone extraordinary change. Everywhere the \r\nmovement in favour of better democratization and of respect for basic human \r\nrights is emerging. We know that such claims will go unheeded if they are not \r\naccompanied by the same vital movement for prosperity and well-being. \r\nFurthermore, a number of important and dramatic events have afflicted us in \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Guinea-Bissau) \r\nrecent times and have led us to be pessimistic. I am convinced that today, as \r\nin the past, the Assembly will be able to find its bearings again. \r\nThe situation in southern Africa is hardly improving in spite of the \r\nannouncement of reforms that will put an end to the system of apartheid. In \r\nview of recent developments in that country we are still concerned. However \r\nwe are following with great interest measures to abolish segregationist laws \r\nadopted by the South African Government and we urge it to continue \r\nnegotiations with the anti-apartheid movements for the final elimination of \r\nthe apartheid system in that country where the overwhelming majority of the \r\npopulation still does not have the right to vote, to decide its own future and \r\nfreely choose its leaders. \r\nInter-ethnic violence caused and maintained by certain backward-looking \r\nforces continues to bring the country bloodshed and affliction. My delegation \r\ninvites the international community to maintain pressure on the South African \r\nGovernment so that the process that has begun may lead to the total \r\nelimination of apartheid and to the establishment of a democratic and \r\nmultiracial society. \r\nThe Assembly is certainly aware of the fraternal links of friendship \r\nwhich bind the people of Guinea-Bissau to the brother people of Angola. That \r\nis why the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, its people and its Government were \r\noverjoyed at the peace process which has begun in that country and which has \r\nled to the establishment of a multiparty system and of democratic, free and \r\nuniversal elections. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Guinea-Bissau) \r\nFor the Angolan people new prospects have opened up enabling it to \r\nundertake the reconstruction and development of its sorely-tried homeland. On \r\nthis occasion of celebrating peace and regained harmony the Government of \r\nGuinea-Bissau reiterates its fraternal feelings of solidarity and its wishes \r\nfor prosperity for Angola. \r\nWe earnestly hope that the peace process in Mozambique will have the same \r\noutcome and that the international community might soon be able to celebrate \r\nthe end of the painful fate into which the civil war has plunged that \r\ncountry. We encourage the Mozambican Government to continue along the path of \r\ndialogue and we exhort RENAMO to show good will in order to allow for the \r\nspeedy establishment of peace in that country so sorely tried by so many years \r\nof violence. \r\nIn Western Sahara we hope that the necessary conditions will quickly be \r\nmet so that a referendum on self-determination under the aegis of the United \r\nNations might be held as soon as possible in order to establish a lasting \r\nclimate of peace and security in that region. \r\nIn Liberia as well, the efforts of the Economic Community of West African \r\nStates (ECOWAS) to create an atmosphere that would lead to a normalization of \r\nthe political situation and to the holding of democratic elections, have, \r\nunfortunately, not yet borne fruit. We reiterate our appeal to the warring \r\nparties, especially the National Patriotic Forces of Liberia, to comply \r\nscrupulously with the Yamoussoukro agreements, especially the agreement \r\nreached on 30 October 1991. \r\nThe quest for a dynamic solution for a global settlement of the problems \r\nof that country are based on essential respect for the rights of all. It does \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n54 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Guinea-Bissau) \r\nnot depend only on the willingness of States and people in the region; it must \r\nalso commit all of us who, for various reasons, have an impact on the \r\nbehaviour of the various protagonists so that there might be a lasting and \r\njust peace. \r\nSomalia has become a field of carnage and of constant concern to the \r\ninternational community. For some time now we have been seeing a fratricidal \r\ncivil war with disastrous consequences for that country and its defenceless \r\ncivilian population. The Assembly, a forum for heightening awareness and a \r\ncourt of appeal, will not fail to ask the international community to give more \r\ncoherent and concrete assistance in the face of this new development in order \r\nto bring this bloody and outrageous conflict to an end. We appeal most \r\nurgently to the parties involved in the conflict to comply with the agreements \r\nsigned in Djibouti and to agree to mitigate the sufferings of that brave \r\npeople. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau, for its part, supports any proposal to \r\nfind a peaceful solution to this conflict as soon as possible. \r\nIn the Horn of Africa there is also Ethiopia, the authorities of which we \r\nwould like to encourage to continue the dialogue begun for lasting peace and \r\nsecurity in that country and in the region. \r\nIn the Middle East, we are convinced that peace is possible if the \r\nparties to the conflict are imbued with the necessary political will. \r\nGuinea-Bissau hopes that a rapid, negotiated solution might be found to the \r\nproblem of the Middle East so that the peoples of that region might be able to \r\nlive in peace. The Palestinian people are however entitled to a homeland, to \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n55 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Guinea-Bissau) \r\na sovereign State, within secure and internationally acknowledged borders. My \r\ncountry therefore supports and encourages all the initiatives undertaken to \r\nrestore peace between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples. \r\nWe welcome the prospects opened up for the restoration of peace and \r\nsecurity in Lebanon. The whole world admires the courage of the Lebanese and \r\nI am certain that the whole world will help them to bring about the triumph of \r\ntheir ideas. The Lebanese people will find a source of justified pride in \r\nthis. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n56 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Guinea-Bissau) \r\nIn Cambodia, new prospects for a lasting peace were opened after the \r\nnegotiations. One of the most recent prospects is the organization of free \r\nelections, being prepared with the welcome assistance of the United Nations, \r\nwhich we should like to commend and encourage. We believe and hope that the \r\norganization of these free and democratic elections will put an end to the \r\nlong years of suffering endured by the heroic people of Cambodia. \r\nAs to the question of East Timor, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau is hoping \r\nfor an acceptable and speedy peaceful conclusion to this serious problem, \r\nwhich is a source of concern to us. The Maubere people must regain its \r\nlegitimate right to self-determination and independence, if it so wishes. I \r\nrepeat: if it so wishes. That is why we welcome the high-level meeting of \r\ndelegations of Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the United Nations \r\nwith a view to finding the necessary framework for a settlement suitable to \r\nall the parties to the conflict. We should like to assure all the parties \r\ninvolved in the process of seeking a favourable and speedy outcome of the \r\nconflict of our availability and support. \r\nIn spite of their admission to the United Nations, the two Koreas have \r\nyet to find common ground for the reunification of the great Korean nation. \r\nThe Republic of Guinea-Bissau is privileged to have good economic and \r\ndiplomatic relations with the two Koreas - north and south. That is why we \r\nappeal to them to continue negotiations for the speedy reunification of the \r\ngreat Korean homeland. \r\nSimilarly, the Republic of Guinea-Bissau urges the Cypriot communities to \r\ncontinue negotiations, with the assistance of the Secretary-General, for a \r\npeaceful settlement of the Cypriot conflict. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Guinea-Bissau) \r\nThe Republic of Guinea-Bissau, again within the context of the quest for \r\npeace and harmony among nations, has undertaken diplomatic relations of \r\ncooperation and friendship with all countries throughout the world that \r\nfervently seek peace and justice. \r\nGuided by this thinking, we also maintain diplomatic relations of \r\ncooperation and friendship with the Republic of China (Taiwan). That is why \r\nwe support and endorse the reference made to that country by the President of \r\nNicaragua from this rostrum. \r\nIn this regard, we pay a well-deserved tribute to the valuable assistance \r\ngiven to my country\u0027s development efforts by another country from the \r\ndeveloping world the Republic of China whose economic performance, which \r\nnow puts it among the major economic Powers of the world, is in many regards \r\nexemplary. \r\nIn Latin America, we welcome and support the peace process begun under \r\nUnited Nations auspices for the restoration of security and stability in that \r\nregion. \r\nSince the developments of 30 September in Haiti, President Aristide, the \r\nconstitutionally elected President, and his Government are still waiting to \r\ntake up their legitimate places, to which they are entitled. The \r\ninternational community and the Organization of American States should help \r\nthem in that regard. Guinea-Bissau, which hopes for a peaceful and speedy \r\nsettlement of that conflict, urges all the parties involved to heed reason and \r\nto respect the basic rights of the Haitian people. \r\nThe growing tension and conflict in Central and Eastern Europe are \r\njeopardizing international peace and security. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Guinea-Bissau) \r\nGuinea-Bissau is anxiously following the evolution of the situation in \r\nthe former Yugoslavia. Each day we deplore the violence and the hatred in the \r\nconfrontations that have cost so many human lives. That is why the Republic \r\nof Guinea-Bissau commends the initiatives and the efforts of the United \r\nNations, through its Secretary-General, and of the European Economic Community \r\nwith a view to achieving a peaceful solution to the inter-ethnic conflict. \r\nThe successful missions already conducted and the restored confidence in \r\nthe Organization give solid grounds for satisfaction and, above all, for \r\nhope. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau hopes that all those involved in conflict \r\nwill rediscover the virtues of dialogue and cooperation, which are the only \r\narms that lead to peace. \r\nThe Government of General Joao Bernardo Viera, President of the Council \r\nof State of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, has committed all of Guinea-Bissau \r\nto a process of pluralist democratization and to the establishment of a State \r\nof law, as well as to the improvement and recovery of the economy, with a view \r\nto greater social justice. \r\nThe process of democratization now under way in Guinea-Bissau is \r\nperceived everywhere as the clear sign of fundamental change, whose goal is \r\njustice, social stability and greater well-being. So that it can be effective \r\nand practical, this process is based on my country\u0027s historical social and \r\ncultural realities. \r\nIn our view, the recent adoption of our Electoral Law narrows the gap \r\nbetween the aspirations of our people and reality, and gives all citizens the \r\nmeans to express themselves freely and indeed to be free. The progressive \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n59-60 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Guinea-Bissau) \r\ndisengagement of the State from the industrial and commercial sector, the \r\nencouragement of private initiative, the promotion of private property and the \r\ncreation of conditions of social stability, unity and national cohesion are at \r\nthe heart of these transformations now taking place in our country. \r\nHowever, experience has shown that the attainment of democratic \r\nobjectives in African countries is necessarily accompanied by some degree of \r\nproblems and of questioning. The determination to democratize is \r\nunfortunately facing difficulties that stem from the implementation of \r\nstructural adjustment policies, which, it should be stressed, do not have the \r\nexpected donor support. This situation worsens the state of impoverishment \r\nand the feeling of frustration of our peoples. The dependence of \r\nGuinea-Bissau, in particular, and of African States, in general, on \r\ninternational agencies and bilateral partners is thereby strengthened. \r\nThere can be no doubt that we are at a uniquely decisive and historic \r\nstage in which all efforts must converge to strengthen the positive trends \r\nthat we have observed and to make them irreversible and give a new dimension \r\nto the relations between parties and States. This new trend which today \r\ncharacterizes international relations bears the hope of stability and has \r\nopened up prospects of peace and understanding. \r\nGuinea-Bissau has, in every instance, endeavoured to work in its foreign \r\nrelations towards a policy based on confidence, dialogue and harmony. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n61 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Guinea-Bissau) \r\nThe process of democratic openness begun in Guinea-Bissau and the \r\nresulting economic liberalization require the constant support of the \r\ninternational community. This democratic process deserves to be supported, \r\nbecause there can be no real democracy without development. It is therefore \r\nclear that a democracy which is not founded on a solid economic base is but an \r\nillusion. \r\nIt is virtually impossible today to discuss international relations \r\nwithout recalling, with sadness, the seriousness of the economic crisis of the \r\ndeveloping countries in general and of the African countries in particular. \r\nThe decline in export earnings, foreign debt and the inadeguacy of resources \r\nfor development, compounded by natural disasters, have served to further \r\ndeteriorate socio-economic conditions in many countries. \r\nThe United Nations has become aware of this situation and has adopted the \r\nProgramme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development for our \r\nbenefit. None the less, the objectives sought have not been attained. The \r\nresponse of the developed countries and of international economic and \r\nfinancial institutions has not been commensurate with their commitments, \r\nthough most of the African countries have agreed to carry out the reforms \r\nimposed upon them. \r\nAfrica remains ready, however, to reaffirm its commitment to apply the \r\nnecessary tranformation policies, as evidenced, inter alia, by the adoption of \r\nthe African Charter for Popular Participation in Development and \r\nTransformation, and the proposals made as a result of the final assessment of \r\nthe Programme. The new framework for cooperation must ensure sufficient \r\nresources; debt reduction and cancellation; and the adoption of lasting \r\nsolutions to commodities problems, in the hope that the agreement thus reached \r\nwill receive the full support of Africa\u0027s partners. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Guinea-Bissau) \r\nIn spite of the truly commendable efforts made by the African Governments \r\nin the framework of implementing programmes of structural adjustment, our \r\neconomic situation and living conditions are becoming increasingly difficult. \r\nThe Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, \r\n1986 to 1990, which had given rise to such hopes, unfortunately has not \r\nresponded to the legitimate concerns of the African peoples and leaders for \r\ngrowth and for viable economic and social development. \r\nThe approaches taken thus far to finding a solution to the serious \r\nproblem of debt, while encouraging in certain respects, are far from \r\nresponding to the real economic concerns of the developing countries. The \r\nsearch for a solution to the foreign-debt problem of the developing countries \r\nmust not only involve a further strengthening of solidarity in the \r\ninternational community and shared responsibility between creditors and \r\ndebtors, but must also take into account the growth objective of the \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\nAs we noted earlier, the world is experiencing extraordinary change. \r\nEverywhere, the trend towards greater democratization and towards respect for \r\nfundamental human rights is in evidence. But we know that these demands will \r\ngo unheeded if they are not accompanied by an equally vital drive towards \r\nwell-being and prosperity. \r\nFurthermore, the international community must give special attention to \r\nthe implementation of the Declaration and Programme of Action for the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries for the 1990s, adopted at the Paris Conference, which \r\nremains a charter for us all. \r\nWe make a pressing appeal to the international community that urgent and \r\nappropriate action be taken with a view to the adoption of a consistent \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Guinea-Bissau) \r\nprogramme of cooperation for the development of the developing countries, and \r\nabove all, of Africa, an almost forgotten continent. \r\nIn this respect, my delegation welcomes the initiative of the Japanese \r\nGovernment to convene once again in 1993 a summit conference on the \r\ndevelopment of Africa, as well as the French proposal, made by President \r\nFrancois Mitterrand, to convene a high-level meeting on social development. \r\nThe course charted by our countries towards greater freedom and democracy \r\nsupports the concept expressed in the \"Human Development Report\" recently \r\npublished by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which recommends \r\n\"a participative form of development in which the human being is placed at the \r\ncenter of the decision-making process\". \r\nIn this context, we are gratified by and we unreservedly support the \r\ndecision to convene a World Conference on Human Rights as planned for 1993 in \r\nVienna. \r\nAlong these same lines, women in Guinea-Bissau participated equally with \r\nmen in the liberation struggle in our country. At the same time, they fought \r\nto win their freedom and emancipation. \r\nIt is for all these reasons that my Government unreservedly supports the \r\nWorld Conference on Women, to be held in 1995. This long-awaited Conference \r\nwil provide an opportunity to review at a very high level the problems of \r\nwomen in the world. \r\nSustainable and lasting economic and social development can only be \r\nachieved in the context of a healthy environment. In our opinion, the Rio \r\nConference was a success, but the implementation of the decisions reached in \r\nthat important and high-level forum will be even more decisive. After the \r\nholding of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, we \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n64-65 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Guinea-Bissani \r\nfocus our hopes today on the Commission on Sustainable Development, which is \r\nto meet at the ministerial level, and whose task it will be to follow up the \r\nimplementation of the programmes contained in Agenda 21 and to see to it that \r\nthey are implemented in an integrated manner. \r\nIn that connection, may I, on behalf of my delegation, extend our warmest \r\ncongratulations and sincerest thanks to Mr. Maurice Strong for the remarkable \r\nwork that he accomplished at the head of a team whose dynamism, expertise and \r\neffectiveness are today recognized by all delegations. Mr. Strong\u0027s tireless \r\nefforts throughout the preparatory process as well as his personal commitment \r\nto the noble task assigned to him by the international community were the best \r\nguarantee of the historic success of the Rio de Janeiro Conference. It is our \r\nhope and our belief that he is among the best-qualified people, if not the \r\nbest-qualified person, to guide the initial steps of the secretariat of that \r\nCommission. This is certainly vital to ensure the effective implementation \r\nand prompt follow-up of the commitments reached in Rio. \r\nIn this connection, the secretariat of the Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment will necessarily require an identifiable structure. Its staff \r\nmust be highly gualified and conform to an equitable geographical \r\ndistribution, and it must base itself on the experience acquired in the United \r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development preparatory process.* \r\nThe President returned to the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n66 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Guinea-Bissau) \r\nThe idea of rapidly establishing a structure and staff for the \r\nimplementation of the recommendations and decisions of the Rio Conference \r\nprompts us to consider that solutions to environmental problems must \r\nnecessarily take into account development in all its dimensions, particularly \r\nin its regional socio-economic dimensions. \r\nPart of Guinea-Bissau, a member of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on \r\nDrought Control in the Sahel (CILSS), is in a region afflicted by drought. We \r\ncall urgently for the rapid establishment of an intergovernmental committee \r\nthat will be entrusted with the development of an international convention to \r\nfight drought and desertification. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau reaffirms \r\nonce again its support of the Bamako Convention, which prohibits the importing \r\nof waste to Africa, and the Bamako Commitment of the African countries \r\nregarding their priorities in the field of the environment. \r\nThe World Summit for Children, held in 1990, broke new ground for the \r\nimprovement of living conditions of children the world over. We have adhered \r\nto and implemented the decisions and recommendations that came out of that \r\nSummit. As our immortal leader Amilcar Cabral said, \"Children are the flowers \r\nof our struggle and the reason for our fight.\" \r\nThe Organization of African Unity (OAU) Conference on the African Child, \r\nwhich will be held next November in Dakar, Senegal, will be an opportunity to \r\nshow our active solidarity with children, who, unfortunately, suffer from so \r\nmany problems and also to show that the international community is in \r\nsolidarity with all African youth. \r\nNow that tensions between East and West have been resolved and \r\nideological antagonism has ended, it remains for us to pay attention to the \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n67 \r\n(Mr. Toure. Guinea-Biscay) \r\ndevelopmental problems of the poor countries and thus to ensure international \r\npeace and security. \r\nIn this very Assembly, for years on end, high-ranking personages have \r\nfrom this rostrum drawn our attention to the decisive role of disarmament in \r\nthe evolution of the developing countries. This is a dimension that we must \r\nnever forget in our work. \r\nThat is why the Government of Guinea-Bissau supports the establishment of \r\na moral and political climate that encourages the total elimination of all \r\narms of destruction, because reductions in military budgets and expenditures \r\nwill benefit economic and social development in many parts of the world at \r\nlarge and in Africa in particular. \r\nLike the environment, other problems suffered by Africa AIDS, \r\ntuberculosis, yellow fever, drugs and more could be faced up to with the \r\nsupport and effective assistance provided by the colossal sums of money that \r\nwould be freed up through complete and total disarmament. \r\nBut at this point we should like to commend the United Nations system, \r\nthe funding bodies and the international organizations both governmental and \r\nnon-governmental such as the World Health Organization (WHO) for their \r\nefforts and support thus far in helping us face the scourges that ravage our \r\ncontinent. \r\nIn spite of the uncertainties hanging over the global economy and \r\ninternational relations in general and above all the risk of marginalization \r\nfor the African continent, it is unthinkable that the peoples, countries and \r\nGovernments affected by crisis might yield to disarray or discouragement. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n68 \r\nMr. GYAW (Myanmar): May I begin by extending to you. Sir, on behalf \r\nof my delegation and on my own behalf, warmest congratulations on your \r\nwell-deserved election to the presidency of the United Nations General \r\nAssembly at its forty-seventh session. We are confident that under your \r\nleadership our deliberations will be fruitful. \r\nAllow me also to express our admiration for the very able and dynamic \r\nmanner in which your predecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi, guided the work of the \r\nlast session. His stewardship of the Assembly at a most crucial juncture in \r\nmankind\u0027s history has left an indelible mark on the institution of the \r\npresidency. \r\nThe delegation of Myanmar notes with appreciation the remarkable \r\nachievements of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the brief \r\nperiod since his assumption of his high office. This world Organization is \r\nfortunate to have at its helm a statesman of his stature and experience at \r\nthis moment in history. He heads our Organization at a time when it is not \r\nonly seized of momentous peace-keeping operations but also challenged by \r\nuncertainties in several parts of the world. May I assure him of the full \r\nsupport of the delegation of Myanmar. \r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express our deep \r\nappreciation to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former Secretary-General, for \r\nthe wise and skilful manner in which he led our Organization through difficult \r\nand trying times. \r\nWithin a short span of 10 months our Organization has grown rapidly with \r\nthe addition of 13 new Members. The delegation of Myanmar warmly welcomes \r\nthem to our midst. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n69-70 \r\n(Mr. Gvaw. Myanmar) \r\nThe admittance of those new Members to the United Nations reflects the \r\nsignificant changes taking place in contemporary international life and has \r\nbrought the United Nations closer to achieving universality of membership. We \r\nfeel sure that the new Members will have positive contributions to make to our \r\nOrganization. \r\nThis session of the General Assembly takes place in an international \r\nenvironment that is markedly different from that which existed even a year \r\nago. Although the end of the cold war has effectively ended ideological \r\nposturing and has led to renewed confidence in the United Nations, it has, \r\nunfortunately, not eliminated all sources of strife and conflict. The \r\nrecourse to arms in the Balkans, the Horn of Africa and other parts of the \r\nworld serve to remind us of the fragility of peace in our contemporary world. \r\nAgainst that backdrop, the delegation of Myanmar is pleased to note that \r\nsteps have been initiated to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to \r\nmeet the twin challenges of maintaining international peace and security and \r\nof dealing with global problems. The summit meeting of the Security Council \r\non 31 January 1992 provided an historic opportunity for taking stock of the \r\nsituation and exploring ways and means of strengthening cooperation, \r\nparticularly in the field of maintaining international peace and security. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n71 \r\n(Mr. Gyaw. Myanmar) \r\nThe fresh look contained in the Secretary-General\u0027s report, \"An Agenda \r\nfor Peace\", is indeed timely, as the Organization, now more than 45 years old, \r\nneeds to adapt to the rapidly changing world. In this process, however, care \r\nneeds to be taken to ensure consistent adherence to the principles articulated \r\nin the Charter. Most important, caution must be exercised to guarantee that \r\nthe sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of States \r\nwithin the established international system are not allowed to be eroded. \r\nTo be truly effective the United Nations must by its own actions inspire \r\nand command the confidence of all Member countries. Its actions must be \r\ngoverned by a sense of justice and guided by the principles of the Charter. \r\nThe decisions of the Organization must reflect that collective will and not \r\nthe narrow interests or predilections of a nation or a group of nations. Any \r\ndeparture from those principles is bound to be divisive and to detract from \r\nour efforts to construct a fair and equitable international order. The time \r\nis ripe to examine whether the constitutional balance between the principal \r\nbodies of the Organization, particularly between the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council, is being consistently maintained as envisaged in the Charter. \r\nIf attempts at reform are to succeed, trust must prevail; and trust, as \r\nthe Secretary-General states in his report, \"reguires o sense of confidence \r\nthat the world Organization will react swiftly, surely and impartially and \r\nthat it will not be debilitated by political opportunism or by administrative \r\nor financial inadequacy\". (A/47/277, para. 83) \r\nTransformations and uncertainties prevailing in the present international \r\nenvironment underscore the need for countries of the world to work together to \r\nremove the root causes of strife and conflict. The Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nwhose membership encompasses close to 110 developing countries from around the \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n72 \r\n(Mr. Gvaw. Myanmar) \r\nglobe, stands out as an organization that can not only safeguard the \r\npolitical, economic and social independence of its member States but also play \r\na constructive role in charting a course to a new global order that is just, \r\npeaceful and secure. Although the world has witnessed unprecedented changes \r\nin recent years, the principles on which the Movement is firmly anchored \r\nremain as valid today as they were four decades ago. So long as the world is \r\nfaced with adverse situations, and the freedom and independence of nations are \r\nchallenged, and so long as the strong exploit the weak, the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, under whatever name, will continue to be relevant. In the light of \r\nthe evolving world situation the Movement can and must play an increasingly \r\nactive role in international affairs to bring about a new world order of \r\njustice, peace and security. For this reason, Myanmar resumed participation \r\nat the Tenth Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement, held last month in \r\nJakarta. As a founding member we have always cherished and adhered to the \r\nprinciples of the Movement and are confident that we will be able to \r\ncontribute positively to the long-term interests of the Movement. \r\nOne field of human endeavour which has benefited from the winds of change \r\nsweeping our world is disarmament. Within the short span of a few years, \r\nthere has been a significant number of agreements on disarmament that together \r\nhave effectively diminished the possibility of a nuclear conflict between \r\nnuclear-weapon States. For this positive trend to continue, it is imperative \r\nthat the momentum generated by the Treaty on the Elimination of \r\nIntermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (INF Treaty), the Treaty on \r\nConventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), and the Strategic Arms Reductions \r\nTalks (START) be carried forward. The agreement of 16 June 1992 between \r\nPresidents Bush and Yeltsin on further cuts in nuclear-weapon arsenals is \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n73 \r\n(Mr. Gyaw. Myanmar) \r\ntherefore encouraging. Noteworthy also is the unilateral decision of the \r\nUnited Kingdom, announced on 15 June 1992, to reduce and in some instances \r\neven eliminate naval and maritime air tactical nuclear weapons. While the \r\nUnion of Myanmar is encouraged by these recent measures, we believe that even \r\nmore significant cuts in nuclear arsenals by all the nuclear-weapon States are \r\ncalled for, so as to remove the sword of Damocles that hangs over our heads. \r\nIn the wake of the Gulf war and the ongoing conflicts in parts of Europe \r\nwhich are in the throes of transition, there is a heightened sensitivity to \r\nthe proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. My \r\ndelegation feels that recent accession by the People\u0027s Republic of China and \r\nFrance to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is a \r\npositive step that will buttress the existing nuclear non-proliferation \r\nregime. All five nuclear Powers with permanent seats on the Security Council \r\nare now States parties to this important multilateral instrument. This augurs \r\nwell for the future of NPT, the review conference for which is less than three \r\nyears away. \r\nSince the twentieth session of the General Assembly, when Myanmar joined \r\nother countries in proposing a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, we have \r\nsought an acceptable balance of mutual responsibilities and obligations \r\nbetween nuclear and non-nuclear-weapon States. It was only because these \r\nresponsibilities and obligations were unfulfilled that Myanmar did not become \r\na signatory. Now that the principal nuclear-weapon States have initiated \r\nmeasures in the direction of effective nuclear disarmament in keeping with the \r\ndeclaration made in the Treaty and relevant resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly, the Myanmar Government has decided to accede to the NPT. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n74-75 \r\n(Mr. Gyaw. Myanmar) \r\nArrangements are in hand to deposit the instruments of accession in London, \r\nMoscow and Washington. \r\nIn the light of the momentous changes in the world, the time has arrived \r\nfor the nuclear Powers to reassess their need for nuclear testing. We \r\ncontinue to believe that a comprehensive test ban is an indispensable step \r\ntowards a nuclear-weapon-free world. We are therefore encouraged by the \r\ndecision of France and Russia to suspend nuclear tests for 1992, and hope that \r\nothers will follow their good example. \r\nThis year is a landmark year for chemical-weapon disarmament. The \r\nsuccessful conclusion of a convention on chemical weapons is the culmination \r\nof years of hard work. For several years now, there has been complete \r\nunanimity in the international community on the urgent need to conclude such a \r\nconvention. It was only because of the complexity of the issues involved \r\nsuch as on-site verification activity and national rights to economic and \r\ntechnological developments to be guaranteed as nations implement their \r\nobligations under the agreement that the convention took years in the \r\nmaking. The convention is one of the most important achievements in the \r\nhistory of multilateral disarmament negotiations, and the delegation of \r\nMyanmar would like to pay tribute to Ambassador Adolf Ritter von Wagner, \r\nChairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on Chemical Weapons, for his unremitting \r\nefforts and to all delegations that have contributed towards the achievement \r\nof the consensus text. Myanmar has consistently sought a total ban on \r\nchemical weapons one that is comprehensive, universal and effectively \r\nverifiable. As a country that neither possesses nor manufactures those \r\nweapons of mass destruction, nor has any intention of acquiring them in the \r\nfuture, we welcome the convention and intend to become an original signatory. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n76 \r\n(Mr. Gyaw. Myanmar) \r\nThe peace Agreement signed on 23 October 1991 provided a comprehensive \r\nframework for ending 12 years of conflict in Cambodia. Myanmar, as a friend \r\nand neighbour, rejoiced at the positive development and looked forward to the \r\nearly implementation of the Agreement. But today Cambodia is faced with a \r\ncomplex of problems. If these problems are not addressed expeditiously, both \r\nthe peace and the economic development that all parties concerned are looking \r\nfor will remain elusive. \r\nThe United Nations has embarked on one of the most ambitious missions in \r\nits history to restore peace with the establishment of a United Nations \r\nTransitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). That organization is doing a \r\ncommendable job in administering the country in the run-up to the elections. \r\nBut to succeed it needs the support of the international community as well as \r\nthe Cambodian parties concerned. We urge all parties to the conflict to \r\ncooperate fully with UNTAC in keeping with the letter and spirit of the \r\nagreement to ensure a smooth path to the elections. \r\nThe Middle East question continues to be of concern to the international \r\ncommunity. Notwithstanding the fact that the peace process has been kept \r\nalive by the ongoing talks in Washington, the question still remains \r\nunresolved. A change of attitude is essential to the resolution of \r\noutstanding issues. My delegation is encouraged to discern some flexibility \r\nnow being displayed by the parties directly concerned. We continue to believe \r\nthat a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region can be achieved \r\nonly through the faithful application of Security Council resolutions \r\n242 (1967) and 338 (1973) in their entirety. \r\nIn South Africa, a democratic reform process initiated last March was \r\nhailed as a major step towards the dismantling of apartheid, and the creation \r\nof ;. — . - • • — - -- - nad hoped that the measure would provide \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n77 \r\n(Mr. Gvaw. Myanmar) \r\na fresh and compelling impetus to the negotiations taking place within the \r\nframework of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa launched in \r\nDecember 1991. Unfortunately the political process was interrupted by the \r\nviolence sparked by the 17 June Boipatong massacre. \r\nWe welcome the recent agreement between President De Klerk and \r\nMr. Nelson Mandela to resume the dialogue. It is our hope that common ground \r\ncan be found to bridge the gap between the principal political players so that \r\nthe communal violence that has rent the fabric of the South African society \r\ncan be avoided and the political process resumed to achieve the goal of a \r\npeaceful transition to a democratic, non-racial and united South Africa. \r\nThe global economy remains sluggish, and the prospects for its recovery \r\nare dim, particularly in the immediate future. The uncertain and unfavourable \r\neconomic environment is having a negative impact on all countries, both \r\ndeveloped and developing, but more so on the developing ones. Now is the time \r\nfor the global community to make an all-out effort for the revitalization of \r\ngrowth. Only a more dynamic world economy can bring about world prosperity \r\nand stability. \r\nThe developing countries are faced with the very difficult task of \r\ncushioning their economies against the world economic slowdown. As \r\ncommodity-dependent economies, they are adversely affected by falling demand \r\nfor their exports and declining world commodity prices. Commodity prices are \r\nat record low levels and are not expected to recover substantially. These \r\ndifficulties are compounded by continuing protectionist trends, moves towards \r\nunilateralism, and managed trade. That is why Myanmar places great importance \r\non a strong multilateral trading system and special significance on the \r\nsuccessful conclusion of the Uruguay Round, which is expected to usher in a \r\nmore open international trade regime. \r\nA/47/PV. 24 \r\n78 \r\n(Mr. Gyaw. Myanmar) \r\nThere were, however, a few encouraging signs in 1991. Net transfer \r\nthrough direct investment showed an upward trend. Also, for the first time \r\nsince the debt crisis in 1982, there was a positive net transfer of financial \r\nresources to capital-importing developing countries. On the other hand, the \r\nflow of official development assistance to developing countries stagnated. \r\nInterest rates retained their historical highs, and payment for debt service, \r\nbilaterally and multilaterally, continued to rise. There was also a further \r\nincrease in the total external debt of the developing countries. Consequently \r\nthe external debt problem of the developing countries remains far from being \r\nresolved, and an equitable and lasting solution to the debt crisis is urgently \r\nrequired. Moreover, to halt the economic slowdown and bring about renewed \r\nimpetus to recovery, a determined and concerted effort by the global \r\ncommunity, particularly by those developed countries whose policies have a \r\ndirect bearing on the present state of the world economy, is a prime requisite. \r\nIn the emerging new global order, the United Nations will be called upon \r\nto play an increasingly active role. The magnitude of the task ahead will \r\nrequire all the energy and attention the world Organization can bring to bear \r\non them. The success of the Organization will depend on the collective will \r\nof the membership to work together to achieve the objectives of the Charter. \r\nThe Union of Myanmar, on its part, will continue, as in the past, to \r\nco-operate fully with the Organization. \r\nMyanmar\u0027s manifest desire to do so is demonstrated by its actions in such \r\nareas of global concern as the environment, narcotic drugs abuse control, and \r\nhuman rights. \r\nSome four months ago nations of the world gathered in Rio for the \r\nhistoric Conference on Environment and Development;. It is now for this \r\nAssembly to take the necessary follow-up measures to consolidate and build \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n79 \r\n(Mr. Gyaw. Myanmar) \r\non the achievements attained in Rio. The three documents adopted by the \r\nConference and sent to the Assembly for endorsement provide the broad \r\nframework for a new global partnership in our common quest for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. A firm commitment to provide the developing countries with new, \r\nadequate additional financial resources on a predictable basis is of utmost \r\nimportance if we are implement the proposed plan of action to protect and \r\npreserve planet Earth. It is hopes that during the course of the present \r\nsession of the Assembly concrete steps will be taken to achieve this objective. \r\nAnother important task for all of us is to determine the specific \r\nprocedures and organizational modalities of the Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and give shape to it. This being the primary intergovernmental \r\nmechanism recommended by the Conference for follow-up and implementation of \r\nits decisions, the importance of the commission cannot be overemphasized. In \r\nour view the proposed commission will not only prove indispensable to affect \r\nthe integration of environment and development envisaged in Agenda 21 but will \r\nalso contribute to enhancing the role of this very Organization. \r\nMuch has been achieved at Rio. But much more needs to be done if we are \r\nto achieve sustainable development for the common good at the national, \r\nregional and international levels. Myanmar is firmly committed to the cause \r\nof the environment and sustainable development, and in keeping with the spirit \r\nof Rio stands ready to shoulder its responsibilities. Having signed the \r\nBiodiversity Convention and the Climate Change Convention, we are now taking \r\nthe necessary measures in accordance with our domestic procedures to ratify \r\nthem at an early date. Since Rio we have redoubled our efforts at \r\nafforestation. We are also engaging in a nation-wide public awareness \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n80 \r\n(Mr. Gyaw. Myanmar) \r\ncampaign stressing the need to preserve and protect the environment. We \r\nrealize that the road from Rio is even more challenging than the one that led \r\nto it. We know that there is no room for complacency. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n81 \r\n(Mr. Gvaw. Mvanmar) \r\nMyanmar\u0027s commitment to the eradication of narcotic drugs remains \r\nsteadfast. Significant achievements have been made in suppressing narcotic \r\ndrugs through the relentless efforts of law enforcement personnel. As in \r\nprevious years, the destruction of narcotic drug and opium refineries \r\ncontinues. Such an event held in Shan State on 5 June 1992 was witnessed by \r\nambassadors, military attaches and representatives of the United Nations \r\nagencies in Myanmar. Activities in the field of medical treatment, \r\nrehabilitation and mass media information have been intensified. \r\nThe problem of narcotic drugs is multifaceted and requires a \r\ncomprehensive approach. While Myanmar has taken an integrated approach, \r\nutilizing sustantial national resources, it firmly believes that these efforts \r\nshould be complemented by cooperation at the subregional, regional and global \r\nlevels. In June of this year, Myanmar took a significant step by signing a \r\nsubregional cooperative agreement with the People\u0027s Republic of China and the \r\nUnited Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNIDCP). A similar \r\nagreement was also signed with Thailand and the UNIDCP. These agreements are \r\naimed at eliminating opium poppy cultivation and reducing trafficking in \r\nnarcotic drugs and chemicals used in the refining of heroin in the \r\nMyanmar-China and Myanmar-Thai border areas. Talks have also been initiated \r\nbetween Myanmar and Laos on bilateral cooperation in the control of drug \r\nabuse. It is also our intention to initiate discussions with our other two \r\nneighbours, India and Bangladesh, with a view to setting up similar \r\ncooperative arrangements. We are confident that these subregional cooperative \r\narrangements will succeed and promote global cooperation to rid our world of \r\nthe scourge of narcotic drugs. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n82 \r\n(Mr. Gyaw. Myanmar) \r\nIn the realm of human rights, Myanmar has been subjected to undue and \r\nunwarranted criticism from some quarters. Critics have unjustifiably \r\nportrayed Myanmar as a land where gross violations of human rights have been \r\nperpetrated this, despite the full cooperation we have extended, and are \r\ncontinuing to extend, to the United Nations bodies concerned with the question \r\nof human rights, providing clarification or information requested of us. We \r\nhave also furnished information sought by the Commission on Human Rights and \r\nby the Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of \r\nMinorities. As a gesture of cooperation we received the two independent \r\nexperts appointed by the Commission on Human Rights in 1990 and 1991 \r\nrespectively. \r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that although we dissociated \r\nourselves from the decision taken at the forty-eighth session of the \r\nCommission on Human Rights, we will be receiving the Special Rapporteur \r\nappointed by the Commission, in deference to the United Nations and to \r\ndemonstrate our good will and cooperation. We are confident that his visit \r\nwill be worthwhile. He will have the opportunity to observe at first hand the \r\ntrue situation obtaining in the country. \r\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that on 24 August 1992 the Union of \r\nMyanmar acceded to the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention, thus affirming our \r\ninternational commitment to humanitarian principles. The principles \r\nenshrined in the Conventions are not new to us. They have been part of the \r\neducational and training process of the Myanmar armed forces and of the values \r\ncherished by our people. \r\nThis year has witnessed many significant developments in our country\u0027s \r\nmarch towards a multiparty democratic State. These developments attest to the \r\ninb r Restoration Council in upholding its \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n83 \r\n(Mr. Gyaw. Myanmar) \r\nassurances to fulfil its declared commitment to meet the aspirations of the \r\npeople of Myanmar. In accordance with the programme of action spelled out in \r\nits Declaration 1/90 of 27 July 1990, the Government issued a follow-up \r\nDeclaration on 24 April 1992 which maps out the programme to be implemented in \r\na specific time-frame in respect of the national convention that will set out \r\nthe basic principles for a new constitution. Our past and sometimes bitter \r\nexperiences have shown that only a firm constitution can guarantee a strong \r\ngovernment which will assure the peace, tranquillity and prosperity of the \r\nnation. \r\nIn accordance with the programme of implementation, a 15-member Steering \r\nCommittee was established on 28 May 1992. The Steering Committee met with \r\nleaders of the elected representatives of political parties and with elected \r\nindependent representatives in June and July to discuss and cooordinate the \r\ncategory and number of delegates to be invited to the national convention. \r\nFollowing a free and frank exchange of views among the participants, there was \r\ngeneral agreement that elected representatives, representatives of the \r\npolitical parties, the national races, peasants, workers, the intelligentsia \r\nand technocrats, service personnel and specially invited persons are to be \r\nincluded in the national convention. Terrorist groups which renounce the path \r\nof armed struggle and return to the legal fold will also have an opportunity \r\nto participate. There is a complete convergence of view to the effect that \r\nthe constitution to be drafted should uphold and safeguard the three main \r\nnational causes, namely: non-disintegration of the Union; non-disintegration \r\nof national solidarity; and perpetuation of national sovereignty. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n84 \r\n(Mr. Gyaw. Myanmar) \r\nWith the successful conclusion of the coordination meeting, the country \r\nhas crossed a threshold, and an important political process has been set in \r\nmotion. The national convention is expected to be convened at the end of the \r\nyear or by the beginning of next year at the latest. To this end, a \r\ncommission has already been constituted and is now actively making the \r\nnecessary preparations for the holding of the national convention. Delegates \r\nrepresenting a broad spectrum of the entire Myanmar population will identify \r\nand lay down basic principles for the drafting of a firm and stable \r\nconstitution. The actual task of drafting the constitution will be entrusted \r\nto the elected representatives. \r\nIn parallel with the preparations being made for the convening of the \r\nnational convention, the Government has undertaken various measures designed \r\nto create an atmosphere and conditions conducive to the establishment of a \r\ndemocratic system in Myanmar. These include: the suspension of all offensive \r\noperations in Kayin State and other parts of the country to consolidate \r\nnational solidarity and unity; the release from detention of individuals \r\nagainst whom action had been taken under existing laws and who no longer pose \r\na threat to the security of the country and the lifting of restrictions on \r\nthem; the reopening of universities, colleges and other institutes of higher \r\nlearning that had been temporarily closed; the rescinding of the curfew order \r\nthroughout the whole country; the revocation of martial law orders that had \r\nbeen in force since July 1989; the reconstitution of township-level Law and \r\nOrder Restoration Councils that are responsible for local administration with \r\ncivilian service personnel in anticipation of the future democratic \r\nadministrative structure and the creation of a separate Ministry of \r\nDevelopment of Border Areas and National Races in order to implement more \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n85 \r\n(Mr. Gyaw. Myanmar) \r\neffectively measures for the welfare of the national races living in the \r\nremote regions of the country. \r\nThe Government of the Union of Myanmar is undertaking these measures \r\nwith conviction and dedication. It is fully aware of the dangers and pitfalls \r\nfaced by nations in transition from one political and economic system to \r\nanother. The Government and the people of Myanmar are determined to carry out \r\ntheir tasks at a sure and steady pace to ensure that the aspirations of the \r\npeople for a democratic Myanmar are realized. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n86 \r\nTENTATIVE PROGRAMME OF WORK \r\nThe PRESIDENT: Following consultations carried out on my behalf, I \r\nhave prepared a tentative programme of work and schedule for the General \r\nAssembly for the remainder of October. \r\nOn Friday, 9 October, in the morning, the Assembly will consider agenda \r\nitem 10, \"Report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization\", \r\nincluding the report of the Secretary-General entitled \"An Agenda for Peace \r\npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping\". Additional meetings \r\nwill be scheduled as necessary. I should like to propose that the list of \r\nspeakers for the debate on this item be closed on Friday, 9 October, at 6 p.m. \r\nIt was so decided. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I therefore reguest those rep»esentatives wishing to \r\nparticipate in the debate on agenda item 10 to inscribe their names on the \r\nlist of speakers as soon as possible. \r\nOn Monday, 12 October, and Tuesday, 13 October, the General Assembly \r\nwill, under agenda item 93 (a), \"Questions relating to the world social \r\nsituation and to youth, ageing, disabled persons and the family\", observe the \r\nconclusion of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons. \r\nOn Thursday, 15 October, and Friday, 16 October, the General Assembly \r\nwill, also under agenda item 93 (a), commemorate the tenth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the International Plan of Action on Ageing. \r\nOn Friday, 16 October, immediately after the commemoration, the Assembly \r\nwill take up agenda item 138, \"Observer status for the International \r\nOrganization for Migration in the General Assembly\". \r\nOn Wednesday, 21 October, in the morning, the Assembly will take up \r\nagenda item 7, \"Notification by the Secretary-General under Article 12, \r\nparagraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations\"; agenda item 13 \"Report of \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n87 \r\n(The President) \r\nthe International Court of Justice\"; agenda item 20 \"Cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Asian-African Legal Consultative Committtee\"; agenda \r\nitem 16 (a) \"Election of twelve members of the World Food Council\"; and agenda \r\nitem 16 (b), \"Election of seven members of the Committee for Programme and \r\nCoordination\". \r\nOn Wednesday, 21 October, in the afternoon, the Assembly will begin its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 14, \"Report of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency\". \r\nOn Tuesday, 27 October, in the afternoon, the Assembly will take up \r\nagenda item 23, \"Question of the Comorian island of Mayotte\"; and agenda \r\nitem 15 (a), \"Election of five non-permanent members of the Security Council\". \r\nOn Wednesday, 28 October, in the morning, the Assembly will take up \r\nagenda item 140, \"Coordination of the activities of the United Nations and the \r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\"; and agenda item 15 (b), \r\n\"Election of eighteen members of the Economic and Social Council\". \r\nOn Thursday, 29 October, in the morning, the Assembly will take up agenda \r\nitem 21, \"Cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of \r\nAmerican States\"; agenda item 24, \"Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Latin American Economic System\"; agenda item 25, \"Cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference\"; agenda \r\nitem 27, \"Cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of \r\nAfrican Unity\".; and agenda item 29, \"Cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the League of Arab States\". \r\nI should like to remind members that, while the Assembly fixed Monday, \r\n20 September 1993, as the date for closure of the forty-seventh session, it \r\nalso fixed Friday, 18 December 1992, as the date on which the Assembly will \r\nrecess until next year. \r\nA/47/PV.24 \r\n88 \r\n(The President) \r\nI hope to keep as close as possible to this schedule so that the Assembly \r\ncan discharge its responsibilities in an orderly fashion. I therefore appeal \r\nto those representatives submitting draft resolutions to do so sufficiently in \r\nadvance of the dates fixed for consideration of items in order to give members \r\nadequate time to examine them. \r\nI should also like to remind representatives that at its 3rd plenary \r\nmeeting the General Assembly took note of the fact that, depending on the type \r\nand complexity of proposals involving changes in the work programme and \r\nadditional expenditures, the preparation of a statement of programme-budget \r\nimplications by the Secretary-General could take a few days and that, in \r\naddition, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions and \r\nthe Fifth Committee would need adequate time to review the programme-budget \r\nimplications of a draft resolution before the latter could be acted on by the \r\nAssembly. \r\nFurther, the Assembly took note of the fact that it was therefore \r\ndesirable that Member States submit proposals involving statements of \r\nprogramme-budget implications in sufficient time to avoid cancellation of \r\nmeetings and postponement of the consideration of items. \r\nThe tentative schedule that I have just announced will appear in the \r\nverbatim record of this meeting, as well as in the Journal summary. I shall \r\nkeep the Assembly informed of any additions or changes. \r\nThe lists of speakers for all these items are now open. \r\nThe meeting rose at- 1.20 p.m. \r\n"
