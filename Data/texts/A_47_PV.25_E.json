Sir, on your election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-seventh session. My delegation is confident \r\nthat your wide experience and diplomatic skill will contribute to the success \r\nof the session. \r\nI should like also to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi, \r\nfor the exemplary manner in which he conducted the affairs of the forty-sixth \r\nsession of the General Assembly. \r\nI am pleased also to convey our appreciation and praise to the \r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for this \r\nconsistent efforts, in the face of numerous impediments, to strengthen the \r\nrole of the Organization in achieving the purposes and principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, as well as for his Agenda for Peace proposals aimed at \r\nenhancing the role of the United Nations in preserving international peace and \r\nsecurity, ensuring justice and protecting human rights. \r\nI should like too to welcome the new Members of the Organization: \r\nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, \r\nSlovenia, Moldova, San Marino, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and \r\nGeorgia. Thei,r accession to the Organization\u0027s membership is a further step \r\ntowards the complete universality of our Organization. It also enhances \r\ninternational acceptability of the principles and purposes of this great \r\nOrganization and boosts its efforts to achieve justice, prosperity, progress \r\nand international peace and security. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n3 \r\n(Mr. Al-Bishari, Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nSince the last session, international relations and the international \r\nbalance of power have undergone profound changes and transformations. Those \r\nchanges have resulted in, among other things, the collapse and disintegration \r\nof what was known as the Soviet Union, and the end of bipolarity. The world \r\nhas begun to seek the establishment of an alternative order whose features \r\nhave not crystallized. In the meantime, there are signs that several of the \r\ncold-war problems such as certain regional conflicts, the dismantling of the \r\napartheid system in South Africa and the slowing down of the arms race may \r\nbe amenable to solution. These developments in international relations have \r\ncreated new opportunities and new challenges. The challenges must be \r\nconfronted by the international community with all seriousness and \r\ndetermination.\u0027 This should be done by strengthening the spirit of \r\nunderstanding and reconciliation that now prevails in international relations. \r\nHowever, this optimism should not stop us from conceding that certain old \r\nquestions and problems have notvbeen resolved yet. Furthermore, those \r\ndevelopments have created new hotbeds of tension in certain areas of the \r\nworld, as evidenced by the eruption of the ethnic conflicts and civil wars \r\nthat have cast their shadows on the international arena. Such unwelcome \r\ntrends make it incumbent upon the international community to do more to \r\nstrengthen the positive trends in international relations so that we may \r\nresolve the residual and the new problems alike. \r\nWithin that context, my country supports the efforts of the States of the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to reach a speedy solution \r\nto the Liberian problem. \r\nWe also urge the international community to encourage the Afghans to \r\nsettle their differences in a manner that would spare them new confrontation. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n4 \r\n(Mr. Al-Bishari. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nAnd we call on the international community to work seriously to end the bloody \r\nconflict in the Balkans by encouraging the republics of the former Yugoslavia \r\nto settle their disputes through dialogue and negotiation instead of force and \r\nviolence. \r\nThe international community should redouble its efforts to put an end to \r\nthe human tragedy of the Somali people and to take appropriate measures to \r\nreach a rational reconciliation, thereby guaranteeing a dignified life for the \r\nSomalis, who are facing a massive famine. \r\nAs for the conflict between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United \r\nArab Emirates, over the islands of Abu Mousa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb, we \r\nwould like to state the need to adhere to the international norms and \r\nconventions that prohibit the occupation by force of the territory of another \r\nState. We call upon our brethren in Iran and the United Arab Emirates to \r\nallow reason, respect for good-neighbourliness, and the principle of \r\nsovereignty to prevail, and to search for a peaceful solution to this \r\nconflict, thereby sparing the region an escalation in tensions. \r\nThe just cause of the Palestinian people has been with the United Nations \r\nsince its inception. Notwithstanding the adoption of numerous resolutions by \r\nthe General Assembly, the Security Council and other organs, the Organization \r\nremains unable to implement its own resolutions. As the Secretary-General \r\nstates in his report to the Security Council on preventive diplomacy, \r\n\"The principles of the Charter should be applied consistently, not \r\nselectively, for if the perception should be of the latter, trust will \r\nwane and with it the moral authority which is the greatest and most \r\nunique quality of that instrument.\" (A/47/277, para. 82) \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n5 \r\n(Mr. Al-Bishari. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nDue to clear discrimination against the Palestinian people who remain \r\nunder the yoke of Israeli occupation and suffer all forms of oppression, \r\nrepression, enslavement and injustice caused by an international community \r\nwhich employs double standards that people rose up in an intifadah against \r\nIsraeli occupation, insisting, properly, on their right to self-determination \r\nand demonstrating that the will of peoples cannot be crushed by repression. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n6 \r\n(Mr. Al-Bishari. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nWe should like to reaffirm from this rostrum our support for the \r\nintifadah of the Palestinian people against injustice and for that people\u0027s \r\nright to liberate their land, to exercise self-determination and to establish \r\ntheir own independent and sovereign State. We urge the international \r\ncommunity to translate its support of the Palestinian people into practical \r\nmeasures by pressing for the immediate halting of Jewish immigration to \r\nPalestine and the occupied Arab territories, the complete halting of the \r\nbuilding of Israeli settlements, the protection of the Palestinian people and \r\nthe implementation of all resolutions relevant to the Palestinian guestion and \r\nto the occupied Arab territories, so that peace and justice may prevail in all \r\nparts of the Middle East. \r\nDespite all the encouraging developments in South Africa over the past \r\ntwo years, recent events have shown that the situation there is still a source \r\nof tension and cause for concern. The recent eruption and escalation of \r\nviolence is an ominous sign of a possible explosion that may jeopardize the \r\nprocess designed to abolish apartheid through negotiation. While welcoming \r\nthe steps recently taken by the international community in this respect, my \r\ncountry will continue its support of the South African people\u0027s struggle to \r\neradicate the system of apartheid, which, it seems, is unwilling to desist \r\nfrom its racist practices voluntarily and, chameleon-like, is desperately \r\ntrying to disguise itself. Therefore, all of us must maintain the pressure on \r\nthat regime to\u0027make it heed the will of the majority, the will of the \r\ninternational community and the relevant United Nations resolutions. \r\nThe remarkable changes and developments in today\u0027s world impose new \r\nresponsibilities on the United Nations in performing its role as an instrument \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n7 \r\n(Mr. Al-Bishari. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nof preserving world peace and security and promoting stability, \r\nreconciliation, development and prosperity for all. Small and vulnerable \r\ncountries have taken heart from the Organization\u0027s increased capabilities, \r\nespecially now that the Organization has achieved marked success in the \r\nsettlement of disputes in Cambodia and Afghanistan, in the realization of \r\nNamibia\u0027s independence and in supporting the legitimate struggle of the people \r\nof South Africa to dismantle apartheid. \r\nNotwithstanding those positive indications in the Organization\u0027s work, it \r\nhas been noted that some still continue to dominate the Organization and to \r\nuse it, under various pretexts, to serve their own political purposes through \r\nthe law of force rather than the force of the law, and by pursuing policies of \r\npolitical and military intervention as well as economic pressure. The \r\npressures to which Libya has been subjected are part and parcel of those \r\npolicies. The same is true of what has been visited upon the Iraqi people. \r\nThus, we call for an end to the embargo imposed against the people of Iraq, \r\nfor an end to their starvation, for respecting their sovereignty and for \r\nnon-interference in their internal affairs. \r\nWhat has become known as the Lockerbie Case is one of the by-products of \r\nthe present international situation and illustrates its effect on small \r\ncountries that pursue independent policies and take independent positions. \r\nThe case also shows the need to introduce basic changes in the mechanism by \r\nwhich resolutions are adopted in the United Nations, and especially in the \r\nSecurity Council, so as to make them more expressive of the will of the \r\ninternational community. The case also pinpoints the dangers inherent in the \r\ntendency of certain States to use the powers of the Security Council to \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n8 \r\n(Mr. Al-Bishari. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nachieve their own private objectives and to use double standards in dealing \r\nwith issues before the Council in a manner that deals high-handedly and \r\narbitrarily with the sovereignty and rights of small and vulnerable countries. \r\nThe Lockerbie Case was raised and forced upon the Security Council and \r\ndealt with under Chapter VII of the Charter, which does not apply, since Libya \r\nneither threatened world peace nor threatened or committed aggression against \r\nanother country, actions it would have to have taken to be liable under the \r\nprovisions of Chapter VII, which relates to the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. Conscious of that, and based on its abhorrence of \r\nterrorism, of which it is a victim, my country expressed, in good will, its \r\nsincere willingness to cooperate in uncovering the facts and circumstances \r\nrelating to the case. Upon being notified of the matter, my country took all \r\nreguired legal measures consistent with international law and conventions that \r\ndo not violate Libya\u0027s sovereign rights. Regrettably, however, the interested \r\nparties refused to cooperate with the Libyan legal authorities, which had \r\noffered to conduct joint investigations of the two Libyan suspects. When the \r\nStates concerned referred the matter to the Security Council, which adopted \r\nresolution 731 (1992) calling upon Libya to cooperate, my country, in letters \r\nto the United Nations Secretary-General, expressed its acceptance of the \r\nresolution and proposed a series of initiatives to implement it. Throughout, \r\nmy country has been motivated by a desire to reach a settlement that would \r\nguarantee the rights of all parties and spare the region the dangers of \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n9-10 \r\n(Mr. Al-Bishari. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\ntension and instability. However, the Libyan initiatives concerning the \r\nimplementation of the provisions of the resolution met the same fate as \r\nearlier ones, for the countries concerned rushed to the Security Council to \r\nseek adoption of another resolution imposing unjust sanctions against the \r\nsmall, peaceful Libyan people, without any legal basis or moral \r\njustification. That action completely ignored my country\u0027s declared \r\ncommitment to effective cooperation in the implementation of Security Council \r\nresolution 731 (1992), as set out clearly in document S/23917 of 14 May 1992. \r\nThe commitment was welcomed by the great majority of the family of nations as \r\nrepresented in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, the Organization of \r\nAfrican Unity, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the League of \r\nArab States, all of which expressed solidarity with the fair Libyan position \r\nfrom the very start of the crisis. In all of their decisions and final \r\nstatements issued in September 1992 those organizations were unanimous on the \r\nfollowing points. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n11 \r\n(Mr. Al-Bishari. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nFirst, praised Libya\u0027s cooperation in seeking a peaceful settlement of \r\nthe crisis within the context of Libya\u0027s national sovereignty, international \r\nlaw, and the principles of the United Nations Charter that govern relations \r\nbetween independent States. \r\nSecondly, called on the parties concerned to respond positively to \r\nLibya\u0027s initiatives calling for dialogue, negotiation, and non-escalation, in \r\norder to reach a solution to the crisis under Chapter VI of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and under the auspices of the Secretary-General, in a manner \r\nthat would be conducive to ending the crisis and its repercussions peacefully, \r\nfairly and quickly. \r\nThirdly, called upon the Security Council to lift the measures imposed on \r\nLibya, which has expressed its commitment to resolution 731 (1992) \r\nAs part of its initiatives, Libya has recently called on the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations to send an international committee to \r\nverify that Libya has met all the requirements of Security Council resolution \r\n731 (1992) related to terrorism. Once again, the parties concerned prevented \r\nthe Secretary-General from responding to this proposal, and - at a time when \r\nmy country had expected the Council to lift or reduce the unjust sanctions in \r\nthe light of Libya\u0027s positive response to the requirements of resolution \r\n731 (1992) concerning terrorism, which we unequivocally condemn, and its \r\ncomplete willingness to provide a fair and unbiased trial for the suspects, \r\nwhich has been agreed to sought to persuade the Security Council to adopt a \r\nnew resolution extending the sanctions for four more months. My country still \r\ncalls for a peaceful settlement to this situation, a settlement that will \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n12 \r\n(Mr. Al-Bishari. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nsafeguard the rights of all, maintain the principles of international law, and \r\nsave the world from escalation and confrontation. \r\nThe unjust sanctions against my country have caused a great deal of human \r\nand material harm, loss and suffering to the Libyan people. My country has \r\nalready detailed those losses and damages in official circulating documents of \r\nthe Security Council. The embargo has affected numerous sectors, especially \r\nin the fields of health and social services. One example of this is the fact \r\nthat the delay in the arrival of medical supplies and instruments has led to \r\nthe deaths of a large number of children, and pregnant women who died in \r\nlabour. It was also impossible to send abroad over 3,000 medical cases that \r\ncan not be treated locally, including cases of heart disease, kidney \r\ntransplants, bone-marrow transplants, neurosurgery, and burns. One hundred \r\nand fifty gravely ill patients, who could not be treated locally, died while \r\nbeing transported overland to airports in Tunisia and Egypt. In addition, the \r\noveruse of land routes to and from the Jamahiriya resulted in an increase in \r\nroad accidents during the last four months of this year compared to the same \r\nperiod in 1991. The number of accidents rose from 2,401 in 1991 to 3,788 over \r\nthe past four months. Deaths from these accidents rose from 389 to 528, an \r\nincrease of about 35 per cent. \r\nAs for economic losses resulting from the air embargo, they have amounted \r\nto $2,157 million as a result of the fall in revenues generated by exports of \r\nfruits and vegetables, in addition to a 44 per cent drop in non-oil exports. \r\nThe sanctions also resulted in the interruption of many industrial activities \r\ndue to the shortage in means of production and spare parts, not to mention \r\nagriculture. The losses in animal and agricultural production, for example. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n13 \r\n(Mr. Al-Bishari. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nare estimated at $1,062,803,000.00 as a result of the non-arrival of medicines \r\nand sera necessary for protecting the livestock sector against animal \r\nepidemics and communicable diseases. \r\nThose who prompted the Security Council to impose these sanctions on our \r\nsmall, peaceful population which has limited resources and has threatened no \r\none bear the political, legal, and moral responsibility for the deaths of \r\nwomen, children, the aged, the handicapped, and the sick. They also bear \r\nresponsibility for the decline in the standard of living, the slow pace of \r\ndevelopment, the spread of epidemics, and the imprisonment of an entire people \r\ninside its own borders. There is no doubt that all of this relates directly \r\nto human rights. History will bear witness to what is being perpetrated in \r\nthe name of the Security Council against a small, peaceful population. \r\nThus, my country would like from this rostrum to call upon the \r\ninternational Organization and the international Security Council, out of \r\nrespect for the principles of justice, to lift these sanctions, which have \r\nharmed the Libyan people and the peoples of neighboring States. It also \r\ninvites the concerned parties to engage in dialogue and to cooperate in order \r\nto reach a solution to this dispute based on sovereignty and mutual respect in \r\naccordance with international norms and laws. \r\nI must put before this international forum some facts that are no doubt \r\nuniversally accepted. The first fact is that all countries, large and small, \r\nmust respect the Charter of the United Nations and uphold international law if \r\nthe world is not to slip into a state of anarchy, which is in no one\u0027s \r\ninterest. The objective of the United Nations should be the protection of the \r\nsovereignty of States and respect for their laws. The second fact is that the \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n14-15 \r\n(Mr. Al-Bishari. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nSecurity Council, the authority entrusted with maintaining international peace \r\nand security, should not become a tool used by some world Powers as a cover \r\nfor their hegemonistic designs. The third fact is the need for an \r\ninternational judicial organ entrusted with trying those who commit acts of \r\nterrorism of any sort or source. Hence, we welcome the call for the \r\nestablishment of an international criminal court to look into international \r\ncriminal cases. \r\nThe consolidation of security and cooperation in the Mediterranean region \r\nis high on the agenda of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, for we believe that \r\nsecurity and peace in that region is vital, not only to the coastal States, \r\nbut also to the peace and security of the world. Thus, my country remains \r\nconvinced that effective security in the region can be achieved only after the \r\ncauses of tension that beset the Mediterranean are removed and after the \r\nforeign navies and military bases are withdrawn from it. Moreover, \r\ncooperation among its coastal States should be increased, coordinated and \r\nintensified. That is why my country would like to underscore the findings in \r\nthe final declaration of the Tenth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nCountries, which called for supporting the efforts aimed at transforming the \r\nMediterranean into a zone of peace, security and cooperation on the basis of \r\nthe principles of respect for the eguality and sovereignty of States, \r\nnon-intervention in the internal affairs of others, and the non-use or threat \r\nof force. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n16 \r\n(Mr. Al-Bishari. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nMy country has consistently affirmed that it supports disarmament because \r\nit is aware of the terrible dangers that armaments pose to our planet. In \r\nthis context, Libya submitted to the Assembly a proposal calling on the United \r\nNations General Assembly to look into the serious phenomena of concern to all \r\nnations, such as international terrorism how to deal with its causes and how \r\nto eradicate it; weapons of mass destruction, and offensive strategic weapons, \r\nwhich constitute a terrifying danger for all, including those who own them. \r\nThe proposal refers also to offering compensation to the peoples who were \r\ncolonized and subjected to repression and suppression by their colonizers. \r\nOur proposal deals also with other important issues, such as the question of \r\nrefugees, exiles and the kidnapped, in addition to reviewing the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. It proposes studying various economic and social problems \r\nand the ills that afflict humanity with a view to finding a solution for all \r\nthese problems and to realizing stability, prosperity and happiness for the \r\nwhole world. \r\nIn addition to this, it is important to solve certain political questions \r\nwhich have been with the United Nations since its inception. All those \r\nquestions are contained in document A/46/840 of 9 January 1992. \r\nOnce again, my country renews its call for disarmament through the \r\nelimination of all weapons of mass destruction of all countries which possess, \r\nproduce or stockpile them, without exception or discrimination. My country, \r\nas party to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty and to the Treaty on the \r\nprohibition of bacteriological weapons and the Geneva Protocol, supports all \r\nefforts aimed at curbing the arms race and at eliminating nuclear weapons. \r\nThat is why we welcome the recent agreement between the United States of \r\nAmerica and the Russian Federation further to reduce their nuclear weapons. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n17 \r\n(Mr. Al-Bishari. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nMy country also welcomes France\u0027s accession to the non-proliferation Treaty. \r\nTo further expand this tendency, my country supports the establishment of \r\nzones that are free of all nuclear, chemical and bacteriological weapons, \r\nincluding Africa and the Middle East. It also supports the proposal of the \r\nArab Republic of Egypt which calls for declaring the Middle East an area free \r\nof weapons of mass destruction. This objective, however, is obstructed by \r\npersistent difficulties resulting from Israel\u0027s continued production, \r\npossession and stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction as well as its \r\ntesting of these weapons and its refusal to heed repeated international \r\nappeals to submit its nuclear facilities to the safeguards regime of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. \r\nIn this present era of change one concrete fact emerges, namely that the \r\ninternational community has not shown the same concern over questions of \r\neconomic development as it did in regard to other questions such as those of \r\npolitical crises. Economic problems, which are a significant factor in the \r\nobstruction of development and growth, are still with us. This does not seem \r\nlogical, especially at a time when the world looks forward to a new era of \r\nsecurity and stability. If this new era is to materialize, appropriate \r\nmeasures should be taken to solve the intractable economic problems of the \r\ndeveloping countries in particular. These include the problems arising from \r\nprotectionism, lack of transfer of technology, reverse flows of resources, \r\nexternal debts and low commodity prices. Furthermore, the imposition of \r\narbitrary measures and sanctions, such as economic embargoes, trade \r\nrestrictions and the freezing of funds and assets by certain developed \r\ncountries against a number of developing countries, must be halted. In \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n18 \r\n(Mr. Al-Bishari. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\naddition, it is very important for the international community to honour its \r\ncommitments vis-a-vis certain programmes, such as the United Nations New \r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. Africa expects a great \r\ndeal from this programme which is supposed to bolster development efforts \r\nstarted on the continent at the regional level by establishing the African \r\neconomic community, and at the subregional level in the form of groupings such \r\nas the Arab Maghreb Union, to which my country is honoured to belong. This \r\nunion aims at intensifying cooperation among its member countries and with the \r\nrest of the continent. It also seeks to enter into wider cooperation with \r\nother countries of the world, especially the European Mediterranean countries, \r\nand to enhance cooperation between the countries of the South and the North. \r\nThe results of the Summit on environment and development which was held \r\nin the middle of this year are a great achievement that bespeaks the \r\ninternational community\u0027s determination to protect the world\u0027s natural \r\nresources. The commitment of the world to preserve the environment was \r\nevident in the agreements on climatic change and biological diversity that \r\nwere reached at that Conference. The important thing now is to cooperate \r\ninternationally and effectively in implementing the conclusions and \r\nrecommendations of the Earth Summit. In this respect, my country welcomes the \r\ndecision of the Summit concerning the setting up of a standing developmental \r\ncommittee and hopes that this committee will become a forum for implementing \r\nthe decisions of Agenda 21 which are aimed at preserving the environment while \r\npursuing development. \r\nConservation of the environment requires both international cooperation \r\nand national efforts. My country participated in the Rio de Janeiro \r\nConference and signed its conventions and agreements. At the national level \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n19 \r\n(Mr. Al-Bishari. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nmy country accords top priority to questions of development. Accordingly, my \r\ncountry has begun to combat drought and desertification through the great \r\nman-made river project which will carry millions of cubic metres of water from \r\nthe southern part of Libya to the arable land in the coastal area where the \r\ngreatest part of our population lives. Our national plans aim at the \r\nreclamation of thousands of hectares of land for both agriculture and human \r\nsettlement. Despite all this, my country still suffers from a severe shortage \r\nof water which is necessary for its economic development plans. This shortage \r\nnot only threatens my country, but will imperil the continuation of life in \r\nNorth Africa and the Middle East unless it is dealt with through international \r\ncooperation. \r\nI must state here that our aspirations after development face certain \r\ndifficulties which my country has raised in several regional and international \r\nforums, including the General Assembly. The Secretary-General himself spoke \r\nabout those difficulties in his report. An Agenda for Peace. I am here \r\nreferring to mines and the remnants of war. During the Second World War, \r\nLibyan territory was used as one of the main theatres for military \r\noperations. Our people have paid an exorbitant material and human price for a \r\nwar in which our country had no stake. Since the end of that war, the Libyan \r\npeople have continued to suffer from the remnants of the war and the mines and \r\nexplosives planted by the warring armies in its territory. \r\nMany regional and international organizations, including the General \r\nAssembly, have adopted resolutions calling upon the countries responsible to \r\nsubmit the required information and technical assistance needed for the \r\nremoval of those mines and remnants, and to pay compensation for the damage \r\ncaused by them. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n20 \r\n(Mr. Al-Bishari. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nToday, we reiterate our call to those countries to act in a responsible \r\nmanner, to respond positively to the appeals of the international community \r\nand to implement the provisions of General Assembly resolutions relating to \r\nthe remnants of war. \r\nThe environment in my country is also threatened by the harmful effects \r\nof pollution in the Mediterranean, caused by the wastes poured into its water \r\nby foreign navies stationed in the area, the over-consumption and \r\nover-production of the developed Mediterranean countries and the dumping of \r\nhundreds of tons of pesticides and combustibles in its waters. This has \r\ncaused an environmental imbalance that is being further aggravated by the \r\nexploitation of the Mediterranean by countries from outside the region. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n21 \r\n(Mr. Al-Bishari. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nHuman rights issues are the focus of the international community\u0027s \r\nattention and are at the top of its scale of priorities. While appreciating \r\nthe role of the United Nations in ensuring the exercise of human rights and \r\nbasic freedoms, we must state that those rights are not scrupulously respected \r\nin a number of regions. In addition, the double standards and the selectivity \r\nthat mar the conduct of certain countries in the area of protecting human \r\nrights have prevented the United Nations, and especially the Commission on \r\nHuman Rights, from effectively performing their role in this area. We hope \r\nthat the World Conference on Human Rights, to be held in Vienna in mid-1993, \r\nwill afford us opportunities to deliberate on all these questions and will \r\nadopt practical measures to deal with them and identify the ways and means \r\nwhereby human rights may be protected and defended against violations.* \r\nMy country attaches great importance to human rights and to the dignity \r\nand welfare of man. This was reaffirmed in the great green document on human \r\nrights, which includes numerous basic principles for the promotion of human \r\nrights. This has been crowned by effective and legal procedures, such as the \r\nlaw on enhancing freedoms, which was promulgated in 1991, the establishment of \r\na national human rights commission and an international committee for the \r\nQaddafi human rights award. Furthermore, Libya has acceded to most \r\ninternational agreements and instruments relating to human rights and measures \r\nare being taken to meet our commitments arising from accession to these \r\nagreements and instruments. \r\n* Mr. Al-Haddad (Yemen), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n22 \r\n(Mr. Al-Bishari. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nOne of the items on the international agenda is the setting up of a new \r\nworld order. There is no doubt that such a world order will not function \r\nproperly and effectively unless we overcome and rectify certain shortcomings \r\nof the United Nations, since the Organization will be the world body that will \r\nplay a fundamental role in the management and coordination of that new world \r\norder. Thus, the most urgent task now is to reinvigorate the United Nations, \r\nrestructure and democratize it. My country welcomes the efforts being made at \r\npresent to reform the Organization and enhance its effectiveness, including \r\nthe encouraging initiatives of the Secretary-General. \r\nHowever, a great deal remains to be done in this respect, such as \r\nensuring full respect for the Charter, and consistent adherence to its \r\nprovisions, without selectivity and without any breach of its principles. We \r\nmust also ensure that the Organization is not dominated by any one and that \r\nits resolutions are respected and implemented non-selectively. Furthermore, \r\nthe role of the General Assembly should be strengthened in a manner that would \r\nensure the effective and full implementation of all its resolutions, as those \r\nresolutions are the true expression of the sum-total of the positions of all \r\nthe Member States. Also, the current composition of the Security Council \r\nshould be reviewed and expanded in order for it to reflect the increase in \r\nmembership of the United Nations. It is also highly important to review some \r\nof the provisions of the Charter. We would like specifically to focus \r\nattention on the veto right in the Security Council. My country was the first \r\nto call for the abolition of that privilege, because it is one of the main \r\nimpediments to the most important role for which the United Nations was \r\nestablished, namely, the maintenance of international peace and security. We \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n23 \r\n(Mr. Al-Bishari. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nhave lately felt satisfaction at the expansion of this call. Many countries, \r\nincluding some current members of the Security Council, have voiced similar \r\nviews, and have come to share our conviction that a system of collective \r\nsecurity that continues to be subject to a veto by some countries can never be \r\ndepended on to maintain peace and security. \r\nIn a few years time, we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations. Over the past four decades, the Organization has performed a \r\nremarkable role in decolonization and has worked tirelessly for the \r\nconsolidation of international peace and security. It has taken many \r\ninitiatives towards the achievement of economic development and social \r\nwell-being. Hence, my country\u0027s welcome for the call to convene an \r\nInternational Conference on Human Rights in 1993 and an International \r\nConference on Population in 1994, as both conferences will afford an \r\nopportunity for the re-assessment of international programmes of assistance to \r\ndeveloping countries, with a view to achieving an optimum balance between \r\npopulation growth and development resources. \r\nMy country welcomes also the call for convening an International \r\nConference on Women in 1995, and attaches great importance to the World Summit \r\nfor Social Development, because it will give political impetus to national, \r\nregional and international efforts and activities aimed at meeting the social \r\nneeds of many developing countries. \r\nAs all those world conferences will take place under circumstances of \r\ninternational change and transformation, my country looks forward to their \r\nresults and hopes that they will lead to the laying of solid foundations and \r\nthe forumlation of clear-cut approaches that would lead to international \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n24-25 \r\n(Mr. Al-Bishari. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nefforts aimed at the strengthening of peace, security and stability for all as \r\nwell as the creation of opportunities for the progress of all mankind. \r\nIn these critical times and in the context of this unstable international \r\nsituation, the small countries of the world look towards the United Nations \r\nwith all their hopes for a brave new world of peace, security, justice and \r\nequality for all that would be built by the hands of all nations alike, large \r\nand small, wealthy and poor; a brave world in which the values of freedom, \r\ndemocracy and human rights are upheld and which will be free of violence, \r\ninjustice and dictatorship; a world of love and brotherhood, where God\u0027s light \r\nshines above the whole Earth the one God, who is Lord of the universe. We \r\nsincerely hope that the United Nations will rise to the great challenges that \r\nface it. The President of the Assembly can count on my country\u0027s cooperation \r\nin every endeavour that will promote, enhance and realize these principles and \r\nobjectives I have spoken of. With peace and love from the small, peaceful \r\nLibyan people to all your peace-loving peoples. \r\nMr. ALLEYNE (Dominica): I am honoured to congratulate Mr. Ganev and \r\nhis country, Bulgaria, on his election to the high office of President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-seventh session. We are aware that he possesses \r\nthe qualities and experience required for assuming the responsibility of \r\npresiding over the Assembly, and we are therefore confident that he will serve \r\nin that capacity with authority, dignity and honour. I assure him of the full \r\ncooperation of the delegation of the Commonwealth of Dominica in the discharge \r\nof his duties. \r\nIt is with great pleasure also that I congratulate and welcome \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali on his election as the sixth Secretary-General of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n26 \r\n(Mr. Alleyne. Dominica) \r\nMr. Boutros-Ghali\u0027s election is a contribution by Egypt, Africa and the third \r\nworld in general to the maintenance of world peace, justice and fundamental \r\nhuman rights. His intellect, integrity, sense of commitment and wide \r\nexperience in international affairs are qualities which, I have no doubt, will \r\nensure excellence in the performance of his duties. I assure \r\nMr. Boutros-Ghali of the strong support of the Government and people of the \r\nCommonwealth of Dominica throughout his term as Secretary-General. \r\nPermit me to formally bid farewell to the former Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations, Javier Perez de Cuellar, who gave 10 remarkable years of \r\nservice to this international body. He will be well remembered for his keen \r\ninterest in the welfare of humankind and more specifically for his efforts at \r\nmaintaining world peace. It is my firm belief that his successor will pursue \r\nthe issues that Mr. Perez de Cuellar hopes will be the main concern of the \r\nUnited Nations in the coming years: maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity, justice, universalization of human rights, and lessening of the gap \r\nbetween rich and poor nations of the world community. \r\nWe believe the United Nations should be a truly international body, with \r\nuniversal membership. However, we do not accept the practice of automatic \r\nsuccession. We insist that all new States seeking admission must qualify for \r\nmembership. Countries seeking admission to this world community must be \r\ncommitted to peace and must accept the obligations of the United Nations \r\nCharter: countries which, in the judgement of the Organization, are able and \r\nwilling to carry out their obligations. \r\nIt is in this context that we wholeheartedly support the decision to \r\nexclude for the time being Serbia and Montenegro from membership of the United \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n27 \r\n(Mr. Alleyne. Dominica) \r\nNations, and we welcome other new members from the former Yugoslavia and \r\nformer Soviet Union. Serbia and Montenegro, on the other hand, by their \r\nbarbaric acts and flagrant violation of human rights through the practice of \r\n\"ethnic cleansing\", have demonstrated a lack of respect for the obligations \r\nand principles of this world body. \r\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica joins the world community in condemning \r\nSerbia\u0027s acts of violence and aggression against the peoples of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, and calls for concerted and effective action in defence of the \r\ndefenceless in those States. \r\nWhile we support unstintingly the resolutions adopted by the Security \r\nCouncil authorizing the use of force to provide humanitarian assistance to the \r\nrefugees and displaced persons of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and applaud the \r\nefforts of different United Nations agencies in that respect, there is need \r\nfor greater effort to stop Serbian aggression and end the civil war under way \r\nin the former Yugoslav Republic. \"Ethnic cleansing\" and violations of \r\ninternational humanitarian law must not be tolerated. Our community of \r\nnations cannot be indifferent to the slaughtering of innocent people. \r\nRecent trends have demonstrated a weakening, and even a disruption, of \r\nthe democratic process, as well as widespread violations of human rights not \r\nonly in Eastern Europe but also in Africa and the Americas. \r\nCivil war coupled with the severity of the drought problem has led to \r\nfamine and death for too many Somalians, and we exhort the United Nations to \r\nspare no effort in alleviating the plight of the starving millions of that \r\ncountry. \r\nThe Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica was deeply gratified by \r\nthe positive outcome of the referendum on reform in South Africa. It seemed \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n28 \r\n(Mr. Alleyne. Dominica) \r\nto confirm the will of the people of South Africa to move forward rapidly \r\ntowards an equitable society where all citizens would be offered their \r\nGod-given dignity and their full right to participate in the affairs of that \r\ncountry. As a sign of support, and in response to the positive vote on the \r\nreferendum, the Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica joined other \r\nnations of the Commonwealth in an easing of people-to-people contacts \r\ngenerally. \r\nWe are however deeply concerned at the persistence of violence and the \r\nfailure of the South African Government to control it, which undermines and \r\nobstructs progress towards democracy and majority rule. We call for a \r\nconcerted thrust to bring an end to violence, and for a constructive and open \r\ndialogue between the Pretoria regime and the African National Congress in an \r\neffort to arrive at an early agreement on majority rule. \r\nThe international community must keep the situation under constant review \r\nand should ease economic sanctions against the minority regime in South Africa \r\nonly in response to firm, significant and irreversible progress towards a \r\ndemocratically elected government based on principles of equality and \r\njustice. We hope for an end to all violence and look forward to peaceful \r\nprogress towards a truly just and democratic system. \r\nThe situation in Haiti is of particular concern to us in the Americas. \r\nThe violence and illegal interruption of the democratic process in our sister \r\nisland has led to continual violations of human rights, increased poverty and \r\nsuffering of the Haitian people, economic degradation and the fleeing of \r\nthousands from their homeland. The subsequent refugee crisis is cause for \r\n9rave concern. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n29 \r\n(Mr. Alleyne. Dominica) \r\nThe Organization of American States (OAS) has made significant efforts to \r\nrestore the democratic system in Haiti, but despite resolutions passed by the \r\nOAS General Assembly and a number of missions to Haiti, along with other \r\ninitiatives, the situation has not been resolved. We urge all States Members \r\nof the United Nations to support the decision contained in the OAS resolutions \r\non the restoration of democracy in Haiti and to participate in their effective \r\nimplementation. The leaks that have enabled the illegal government to survive \r\nand even consolidate its position in the face of the embargo must be closed \r\noff. \r\nIn his statement before the United Nations General Assembly in \r\nDecember 1991, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali stated: \r\n\"If there is no development without democracy, there can also be no \r\ndemocracy without development.\" (A/46/PV.59. p. 16) \r\nThe economic situation in Haiti is an issue that needs to be addressed. \r\nLabelled the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, Haiti continues to \r\nsuffer economic deterioration. The Members of the United Nations cannot turn \r\na blind eye to the urgent and basic development needs of Haiti. Our concerted \r\nefforts at restoring democracy must be accompanied by plans for immediate \r\nimprovements in the social and economic conditions of the people of this \r\nCaribbean nation. \r\nWithin this context, Dominica issues a warning that the collapse of the \r\nbanana industry in Dominica and the Windward Islands, which may be the \r\ninevitable consequence of imposing a tariff on bananas under the General \r\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, would immediately and dramatically adversely \r\naffect the economic and social conditions of those small island developing \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n30 \r\n(Mr. Alleyne. Dominica) \r\nStates. We would find ourselves dealing, not with one Haiti, but with three \r\nor four in the Caribbean. Such an upheaval could very easily be avoided at no \r\nappreciable cost to the basic principles of world trade. What we need is \r\ncontinuing flexibility based on a recognition of the already proclaimed \r\nspecial needs of small island developing countries. \r\nAllow me, in the context of the discussion of violations of human rights, \r\nto refer to Iraq\u0027s flagrant violation of United Nations Security Council \r\nresolution 688 (1991), which requires Baghdad to end the repression of its \r\ncitizens and allow access by international humanitarian organizations. It is \r\nthe responsibility of Iraq as a Member of the United Nations to comply fully \r\nwith United Nations Security Council resolutions. Iraq\u0027s continued violation \r\nof these resolutions and continued repression of its civilian population must \r\nbe condemned. \r\nOne of the fundamental principles of the United Nations is respect for \r\nthe sovereignty of each Member State. It is with this in mind that we \r\nconsider intolerable the assumption that one sovereign State can with impunity \r\ncommit criminal offences in another sovereign State on the pretext of \r\npromoting law enforcement. National sovereignty is not of varying value \r\ndepending on the size or wealth of the nations. The rule of law must be \r\nupheld between States as well as within States. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n31 \r\n(Mr. Alleyne. Dominica) \r\nThe quest for the protection of the environment continues to be pursued \r\nvigorously, and the efforts of international organizations must be applauded. \r\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in Rio last \r\nJune, is proof, according to Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali, that nations \r\nunderstand the very fragile nature of the Earth and how very important it is \r\nto save our planet. The question to be addressed, then, is how to approach \r\nthe problem of environmental degradation in a manner which will protect the \r\ninterests of both developing and industrialized countries. \r\nOut of the Earth Summit emerged the Rio Declaration on Environment and \r\nDevelopment, consisting of a set of principles aimed at governing the economic \r\nand environmental behaviour of individuals and nations in the quest for global \r\nsustainability. Agenda 21 covers all areas affecting the relationship between \r\nthe environment and the economy and deals with the protection of the \r\natmosphere and of the oceans; combating deforestation, desertification and \r\ndrought; the role of indigenous peoples and women in implementing sustainable \r\ndevelopment; the meeting of basic human needs; and, very importantly, the \r\ntransitional patterns of production and consumption in the industrialized \r\ncountries which would significantly reduce their disproportionate contribution \r\nto the deterioration of the Earth\u0027s environment. \r\nWe must be cognizant of the difficulties to be encountered in our \r\nattempts to accomplish some of the goals of Agenda 21. \r\nThe industrialized countries have gained economic prosperity in disregard \r\nof the resultant destruction of the environment. The developing countries, \r\nfor their part, are seeking, belatedly, to raise the standard of living of \r\ntheir populations, primarily through a process of industrialization patterned \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n32 \r\n(Mr. Alleyne. Dominica) \r\non the model of the developed countries. That quest will no doubt take its \r\ntoll on the environment. \r\nThe responsibility of the industrialized countries to contribute to the \r\nprogress of the developing countries in a compensatory manner must be \r\nrecognized. They must compensate for damage to the environment and for \r\ninjustice to the developing countries. \r\nThe sovereign right of a country to use its natural resources for its \r\neconomic development, while respecting the environment and bearing in mind the \r\nneeds of future generations, must be recognized. Small countries, no less \r\nthan large ones, have the right to pursue their national interests free from \r\nthe bullying threats of special-interest groups. \r\nFinally, I should like to recall that Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali, in \r\nhis induction speech on 3 December 1991, promised to streamline the operations \r\nof the United Nations, \"eliminating what is wasteful and obsolete \r\n(A/46/PV.59. p. 16). If our objective of achieving progress towards world \r\npeace is to be realized, we must strengthen, not weaken, the ability of the \r\nUnited Nations to provide technical and material assistance to developing \r\ncountries \"in order to narrow the gap between the rich North and the poor \r\nSouth\" (A/46/PV.59. p. 13). It will also help us to achieve the \"agenda of \r\njustice\" which the outgoing Secretary-General, the distinguished diplomat \r\nJavier Perez de Cuellar, identified as the dominant concern of the United \r\nNations in the years ahead. \r\nThe restructuring of the United Nations is a very urgent need. We are \r\nliving in a dynamic world where, every day, events make heavy demands on the \r\nOrganization. The United Nations has had to deal with those demands in a \r\nrather ad hoc manner, and if it is to become more responsive to the needs of \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n33 \r\n(Mr. Alleyne. Dominira) \r\nMember States and to function more effectively within the parameters of the \r\nCharter, a comprehensive analysis needs to be undertaken immediately and new \r\nmachinery put in place to make the tasks of preserving world peace and \r\npromoting fundamental human rights achievable. \r\nDuring the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly, there was much \r\ndiscussion on reforming the Organization. Emphasis was placed on streamlining \r\nthe Secretariat and increasing the authority of the Secretary-General. There \r\nis need at this point to do more in-depth study of the plan worked out by the \r\n22 industrialized and developing countries and of the final report prepared by \r\nthe Nordic United Nations Project. The important thing is that whatever is \r\ndone must render the Organization more effective in promoting peace and \r\ndevelopment throughout the world. Anything less would merely perpetuate the \r\nwaste of limited resources. It must be made clear that the world cannot long \r\ncontinue on its present path. \r\nMr. ADOUM (Chad) (interpretation from French): In addressing the \r\nGeneral Assembly this afternoon from this rostrum, I should like first of all \r\nto offer Mr. Ganev my warmest congratulations on his unanimous election as \r\nPresident for the forty-seventh session. His great experience is \r\nunquestionably a most valuable assurance for the international community \r\nduring this tumultuous period in the world, a world which is seeking peace, \r\nsecurity and well-being. He can count on the strong support and the full \r\ncooperation of the Chadian delegation, which it is my privilege to head. \r\nAmbassador Samir Shihabi, his predecessor, won our admiration with the \r\ntact and skill with which he handled the serious questions that arose during \r\nthe period of his mandate. We express to him our fullest appreciation for his \r\nvaluable contribution. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n34-35 \r\n(Mr. Adoum. Chad) \r\nLess than 10 months after the beginning of his term of office, the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has put his stamp on the \r\nOrganization and has been called upon to play a role of growing importance in \r\nthe life of free peoples and nations. We wish him ever-greater successes and \r\noffer him our support in the execution of his weighty duties. We have no \r\ndoubt he will discharge his tasks with his well-known skill and tenacity. \r\nI should also like to extend a warm welcome to the new Members of the \r\nOrganization. Their presence here cannot but strengthen the universality of \r\nthe United Nations, the goal of whose founding fathers was to bring together \r\nall peoples, put an end to the scourge of war and other forms of conflict, and \r\nabove all to ensure socio-economic development and fraternity among men. \r\nAt the last session of the General Assembly my delegation set forth the \r\nchanges that had taken place in Chadian politics. We announced the enactment \r\nof the law on the conditions for the creation and functioning of political \r\nparties in the framework of pluralistic democracy and on the holding of a \r\nnational sovereign conference scheduled for May 1992. It goes without saying \r\nthat a meeting of such crucial importance for the future of the country had to \r\nbe most carefully and rigorously prepared if optimum results were to be \r\nachieved. Thus, it was not possible to convene the conference on the \r\nscheduled date because the commission in charge of preparations for it did not \r\nsubmit its conclusions in time. \r\nToday I am in a position to announce from this rostrum that the Chad\u0027s \r\nnational sovereign conference will take place during the first quarter of \r\n1993, at the latest. This is a solemn commitment and one that has been \r\nrepeatedly reaffirmed. Similarly, I reiterate here and now that the \r\ndemocratic process under way in my country is irreversible. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n36 \r\n(Mr. Adoum. Chad) \r\nLooking forward to this important date, and with a desire to bring \r\ntogether the largest possible number of our fellow citizens in the daily \r\nmanagement of the affairs of the State, President Idriss Deby decided, after \r\nlong consultations, to modify the National Charter which has governed Chad \r\nsince 4 March 1991. On this basis, Mr. Joseph Yodoyman, a member of the \r\nopposition, has been appointed Prime Minister and Head of Government. The new \r\nGovernment includes both representatives of the opposition parties and \r\nrepresentatives of ordinary citizens. This forward-looking government has set \r\nfor itself the objective of pursuing the orientation plan presented to the \r\ndonors and sponsors of Chad in Geneva in June 1990. Stress has been laid on \r\ndisengagement of the State, privatization, liberalization of the economy and \r\nsector-based development, with priority given to competence and experience in \r\nthe administration and to maintaining a dialogue with our social partners. \r\nLike many other countries on the continent, Chad is confronting an \r\nunprecedented economic and financial crisis. To deal with the crisis, the \r\nGovernment adopted a number of measures to stabilize public finances. These \r\nmeasures included: an increase in individual income taxes; a 50 per cent \r\ndecrease in compensation given to all governmental and related workers; a \r\n10 to 20 per cent reduction in indexed income; a 20 per cent reduction in \r\nlump-sum income; a 10 per cent reduction of the numbers working in public \r\nadministration; and a reduction in State spending. These measures, which \r\naffect workers in both the public and the private sectors, encountered the \r\nvigorous opposition of the trade unions, leading to days of strikes in May, \r\nJune, July and August 1992. \r\nAlthough the strikes were conducted lawfully, the Government had no \r\nchoice but to maintain these measures, the overriding necessity of which was \r\nrepeatedly underscored in the face of limited national resources. To make it \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Adoum. Chad) \r\npossible for these measures to have effect, the Government is at the present \r\ntime negotiating with social partners a social truce that will apply to the \r\nrest of the year. \r\nThe Chadian people, officials and agents of the public and private \r\nsectors have a moral obligation to endure these sacrifices if they are to be \r\nable to look forward to the future with greater hope and serenity. With a \r\nview to reducing expenditures and establishing balance, the Government is \r\npursuing its programme of restructuring the army. In this respect a protocol \r\nagreement has been signed with France which should make it possible to reduce \r\nthe army from 50,000 to 25,000 men and to integrate all forces into a truly \r\nnational army. This means that the French Government is giving us technical \r\nand financial assistance in this tremendous undertaking. \r\nIn connection with this programme, my country has not lost sight of \r\nquestions of security at the regional level, and we have taken part in \r\nsubregional cooperative meetings in this regard. At the initiative of the \r\n10 States members of Central Africa, the United Nations General Assembly \r\nadopted by consensus on 6 December 1991 resolution 46/37 B entitled \"Regional \r\nconfidence-building measures\". In keeping with this resolution, on \r\n28 May 1992 the Secretary-General of the United Nations announced the creation \r\nof the Permanent Consultative Committee on Questions of Security in Central \r\nAfrica. The Committee is charged with developing confidence-building \r\nmeasures, promoting the limitation of armaments and furthering development in \r\nthe subregion of Africa. From 27-30 July 1992, in Yaounde, Cameroon, the \r\nCommittee held its organizational meeting at the ministerial level, with the \r\nassistance of the Office of Disarmament Affairs of the United Nations \r\nDepartment of Political Affairs. In its final report on this meeting, the \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n38 \r\n(Mr. Adoum. Chad) \r\nCommittee laid down, among other measures within the framework of \r\npeace-building, assistance for restructuring the army and providing new job \r\ntraining to military personnel. We place tremendous hopes in the results of \r\nthis meeting and expect eventually to benefit from this assistance as we \r\nendeavour completely to reorganize our army. \r\nDuring the most critical periods of its history Chad has always enjoyed \r\nthe invaluable support of the international community, and the Chadian people \r\nand Government are particularly grateful for this. Today again we urge all \r\nour partners to help us to carry out our ongoing stabilization programmes, and \r\nto stimulate economic activity in the country. These programmes have been \r\nlaid down in a political context that has not always been conducive to the \r\nprocess of democratization that had been begun. Indeed, there have been here \r\nand there pockets of resistance to change, leading to instances of rebellion \r\nthat have been put down thanks to the Government\u0027s policy of reaching out and \r\npromoting dialogue. Several peace agreements have thus been signed with \r\nrebellious movements, with the support of friendly countries, which deserve \r\nour heartfelt gratitude. \r\nOur joy at the ending of the cold war, which led to the beginning of a \r\nfruitful dialogue in the Security Council, is matched by our concern at a \r\nresurgence of certain problems such as injustice, ultranationalism, racism and \r\nreligious fundamentalism, all of which are potential sources of conflict. The \r\nChadian delegation would like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his report, \"An Agenda for \r\nPeace\", which gives us valuable guidelines towards achieving a more secure, \r\npeaceful and just world. \r\nBut, as I said, there remain many sources of potential concern. In \r\nEurope, for example, an area that had been spared violent upheavals thus far/ \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n39-40 \r\n(Mr. Adoum. Chad) \r\nwe are now helplessly witnessing a situation that defies the conscience of the \r\nworld. The breakup of the former Yugoslavia could have led to relationships \r\nother than those based on war, particularly since the birth of that country \r\nhad been accompanied by much suffering. We denounce practices such as \"ethnic \r\ncleansing\", a notion we had thought definitively eradicated from the language \r\nof modern nations. Chad believes that, whether in the States that have \r\nemerged from the former Yugoslavia or elsewhere, our conduct should be guided \r\nby the hallowed principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of \r\nall other related instruments. \r\nOn the other hand, the Chadian delegation welcomes the evolution of the \r\nsituation in Cambodia and expresses the hope that this most ambitious \r\noperation undertaken by the United Nations will be successfully concluded, as \r\nis so ardently desired by the international community and by the Cambodian \r\npeople, who have suffered long enough. \r\nTurning now to the situation in the Middle East and Palestine, my \r\ndelegation observes that the process which began last year in Madrid has \r\ncontinued towards a lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli crisis. The results \r\nof the Washington meetings, however, have fallen short of expectations. While \r\nwe believe that a certain dynamism emerged, this will lead to success only if \r\nthe relevant United Nations resolutions are taken into account in good faith \r\nthus showing a clear determination to restore peace and security in that part \r\nof the world. \r\nEven if the end of the confrontation between the two blocs has led to \r\ncertain bright spots in Africa, with the logic of peace at work in Angola and \r\nMozambique, even if democratization has made considerable progress, peace and \r\nharmony are not yet at home in many parts of the continent. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n41 \r\n(Mr. Adoum. Chad) \r\nFor example, in South Africa, notwithstanding the positive initiatives of \r\nthe minority Government, we must continue to condemn manoeuvres aimed at \r\nsetting some peoples against others in an attempt to justify a system that \r\nbelongs to another age. The international community must bring sustained \r\npressure to bear to ensure that the vestiges of primitive racism will yield to \r\na democratic, multiracial and egalitarian South African society. \r\nMy country also deplores the break-up of the Somalian nation as a result \r\nof the appetites of certain warlords there. It is high time that we put an \r\nend to this abominable carnage whose victims are always the same: women and \r\nchildren. \r\nWe strongly support the current initiatives of the Organization of \r\nAfrican Unity, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the \r\nUnited Nations, and we urge the heads of the Somali factions to sit down at \r\nthe negotiating table and try to put an end to the terrible tragedy of the \r\nSomali people. \r\nLiberia symbolizes the freedom of the black man. For the past two years \r\nit has been bogged down in a war that has taken a heavy toll in human lives \r\nand economic infrastructure. We appeal to the sense of responsibility of the \r\nprimary leaders of that country and urge them to heed the voice of reason. \r\nCivil war in the last decade of the twentieth century is a major \r\nchallenge to the constantly expressed desire for peace and security. In the \r\nrecent past Chad has experienced internal crises, so we are hardly in a \r\nposition to preach to anyone. But we still believe that a sincere commitment \r\nto disarmament or rigorous control of the transfer of conventional weapons, \r\nwhich are flooding zones of tension or open conflict, is an absolute necessity. \r\nMy delegation welcomes the opening of the Register on Conventional Arms \r\nestablished by the Secretary-General. However, we have no illusions as long as \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Adoum. Chad) \r\nthere are secret sales of weapons, which are a source of income for certain \r\nsuppliers and a means of acquiring power for the many beneficiaries. \r\nIf today, with a degree of optimism, everybody could agree there is a \r\nreal desire for change and progress in the world with regard to democracy and \r\nhuman rights, the economic situation in many developing countries of Africa, \r\nLatin America and Asia remains particularly disturbing notwithstanding some \r\nprogress that has been made. The cold statistics of the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme, the World Bank and the United Nations give us food for \r\nthought. The economic situation of the developing countries requires urgent \r\nsolutions. \r\nAs was stressed by the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali at \r\nthe eighth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, \r\n\"The economic crisis that results from weakening investments and the slow \r\ngrowth of democratic institutions has threatened the national stability \r\nof these countries and their political future. Zones of poverty, which \r\nfar from beginning absorbed are only spreading, are potential sources of \r\nviolence and confrontation. The proof has already been given that these \r\nareas could flare up in ethnic, tribal or national conflicts. Therefore \r\nlasting development is an essential factor in the establishment of world \r\npeace and stability, which is undeniably in the mutual interest of all \r\nthe members of the international community, whether developed or \r\ndeveloping.\" \r\nMy delegation supports that analysis, and we urge the international \r\ncommunity to implement without delay the various instruments that have been \r\nadopted thus far, in particular the Declaration on International Economic \r\nCo-operation, more specifically the growth the development of the developing \r\ncountries. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n43 \r\n(Mr. Adoum. Chad) \r\nIf there is one question that is of concern to all the members of the \r\ninternational community, it is the challenge of the environment. My country \r\nis located in a Sahelian area and daily witnesses the deterioration of its \r\nenvironment, so we attach special importance to this question at both the \r\nnational and regional levels. However, the universality of the question means \r\nthat it can be tackled only within the framework of international co-operation \r\nbased on interdependence and solidarity. While we welcomed the Rio Conference \r\non the Environment and Development, we still believe that its results will not \r\nput an end to the many and varied threats to the environment if real substance \r\nis not given to the concept of sustainable development. \r\nOver the past few years human rights have played a preponderant role in \r\nthe lives of nations. New concepts that are still vaguely defined have \r\nemerged. However, political pluralism alone will not solve all the problems \r\nof more than half of mankind. That is why we hope that at the 1993 Conference \r\nall questions concerning human rights will be tackled. \r\nThe United Nations is revived and refreshed as a result of the end of the \r\nera of confrontation between the super-Powers. The Organization has recorded \r\nastounding successes in such varied fields as decolonization and the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security thanks to the Blue Helmets who \r\nare scattered around the world, notwithstanding the difficulties that have \r\nbeen encountered in implementing the ideals of the Charter. \r\nOne such ideal is the need for solidarity among peoples, and that \r\nsolidarity can be realized only if we take into account the elementary needs \r\nof those who are destitute. On the threshold of the twenty-first century, men \r\nmust show that, having avoided a nuclear holocaust, they are now capable of \r\nbuilding a universal peace through development. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n44-45 \r\nMr. MESFIN (Ethiopia): On behalf of the Ethiopian delegation and \r\nmyself I wish to extend heartfelt congratulations to you. Sir, on your \r\nelection as President of the forty-seventh session of the General Assemblyl. \r\nMy delegation is confident that, under your wise guidance, the current session \r\nof the General Assembly will achieve outstanding successes. In this \r\nconnection I wish to assure Your Excellency of my delegation\u0027s full \r\nco-operation in the discharge of your responsibilities. \r\nI also wish to express my delegation\u0027s sincere appreciation to your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for his able \r\nstewardship of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. \r\nLikewise, I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-General, for his vigorous efforts to \r\nfulfil the mandate bestowed upon him by the world community. We are confident \r\nthat under his able leadership the stature and credibiility of the United \r\nNations will be further enhanced. We wish him every success in his endeavours. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n46 \r\n(Mr. Mesfin. Ethiopia) \r\nMy delegation is also pleased to extend a cordial welcome to all the new \r\nMembers of the United Nations which have joined our family during the last 12 \r\nmonths. \r\nThe end of the cold war, which was a great turning-point in history, was \r\nfollowed by further positive changes in the international political climate. \r\nHowever, it is a matter of concern to us that there are still conflicts raging \r\nin many parts of the world. The thaw in the relations between East and West \r\ndid not necessarily lead to total peace, devoid of human suffering and \r\nhardship. \r\nIn this regard, I should like to draw the Assembly\u0027s attention to the \r\nunfolding tragedy in Somalia, which defies imagination and affronts our senses \r\nand sensibilities. Over the past two years, the situation in the country has \r\ndeteriorated so much that the State has ceased to exist. Law and order, peace \r\nand stability and the basic infrastructure necessary for the life of a \r\nfunctioning society are virtually non-existent. These have all been destroyed \r\nby acts of internecine warfare, the extent of whose damage and the consequent \r\nhuman suffering combine to make Somalia one of the worst humanitarian crises \r\nin living memory. \r\nIt is lamentable that Somalia should be bleeding to death by the actions \r\nof its own sons. Nearly half the total population of the country has been \r\ndislocated by war and famine. Scores of children and old people are dying \r\nevery day, while thousands have perished. The Somali people have left their \r\nhomes and fled to neighbouring and other countries. \r\nGiven the situation in Somalia today, it is pertinent to ask why the \r\nvarious factions are doing all this to their own country and people. Why this \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Mesfin. Ethiopia) \r\nwanton destruction for the sake of political power over a disintegrating \r\ncountry? How can one explain what is being done to the people of Somalia, \r\nsomething which goes beyond any conceivable political cause or justification \r\nwhen we see women, children and the elderly being killed indiscriminately \r\nmerely because they belong to this clan or that sub-clan? \r\nThis nightmare must come to an immediate end. The Ethiopian people can \r\nspeak from their own history of 30 years of conflict: war and the application \r\nof brute force and senseless destruction cannot by any means provide the \r\nsolution to a country\u0027s political problems. We believe that the bloodletting \r\nin Somalia during the past two years should serve as a sufficient lesson to \r\nthe various factions that the path of conflict can only lead to more \r\ncatastrophe. Historical knowledge confirms beyond a reasonable doubt that the \r\nuse of force or war never achieved lasting results in the conduct of human \r\naffairs. It is our firm conviction that the protagonists in the current \r\ncrisis in Somalia should make the welfare and interests of the country and the \r\npeople they claim to represent uppermost in their minds. \r\nIt must be stated that Somalia\u0027s neighbours, the countries of the Horn \r\nof Africa, did not spare the slightest effort to bring about a peaceful \r\nresolution of the tragic conflict. \r\nIt will be recalled that a Horn of Africa summit meeting on humanitarian \r\nissues was convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in April 1992. Its main \r\nobjective was to examine the serious humanitarian crisis in the subregion and \r\nwork with regional organizations and the United Nations in order to save lives \r\nand ultimately bring the warring factions together with a view to seeking a \r\nsolution to the fratricidal conflict. At the end of the summit meeting, a \r\nDeclaration, Framework of Cooperation and Programme of Action was issued. This \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n48 \r\n(Mr. Mesfin. Ethiopia,) \r\nwas followed by the Horn of Africa Conference on Humanitarian Issues, held to \r\nformulate modalities for the effective implementation of the summit \r\nDeclaration. A resolution on the situation in Somalia was subseguently \r\nadopted which, inter alia, provided for a cease- fire among the warring \r\nfactions, the holding of immediate peace talks leading to national \r\nreconciliation and lasting political settlement in the country, and the \r\nunhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people in need. Most \r\nsignificantly, the summit meeting decided to establish a high-level Standing \r\nCommittee of the Horn of Africa on Somalia to coordinate ongoing efforts to \r\nbring about a peaceful resolution of the conflict. \r\nIn fulfilment of its mandate, the Committee convened an all-party \r\nmeeting on Somalia in Bahr-Dar, Ethiopia, in May 1992. At that meeting \r\nagreement was reached on the effective distribution of humanitarian assistance \r\nand on convening a national reconciliation conference. To follow up the \r\nimplementation of these two agreements, the Chairman and other members of the \r\nCommittee visited Somalia twice in May and August 1992 and held talks with \r\nleaders of various political organizations. The result of the mission has \r\nbeen generally satisfactory under the circumstances. The Committee is still \r\nactively seized of the crisis in Somalia in all its aspects. \r\nThe effort of the countries of the Horn of Africa is a practical \r\nmanifestation of the principle that regional conflicts should, as far as \r\npossible, be resolved by the countries of the area concerned. Although the \r\nsituation in Somalia has for some time been ignored and left on the sidelines, \r\nit is encouraging to note that the United Nations and donor Governments are \r\ngiving it the necessary attention it so rightly deserves. The international \r\neffort to distribute humanitarian assistance to those in need should be \r\nfurther intensified as a matter of top priority. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n49-50 \r\n(Mr. Mesfin. Ethiopia) \r\nThe efforts under way by the Governments of the Horn of Africa, the \r\nUnited Nations, the Organization of African Unity, and others, to bring about \r\nlasting peace in Somalia should henceforth be pursued in a coordinated \r\nmanner. We should all speak with one voice to the parties in the conflict. \r\nThe message they should get should be one, and only one: that they cannot \r\ncontinue with their callous disregard for the interests and welfare of the \r\npeople of Somalia; that the existence of Somalia as a nation should, first and \r\nforemost, be of paramount importance; that there is no way they can achieve \r\ntheir aims through war; and that they should be prepared to resolve their \r\ndifferences by peaceful means. \r\nIn this connection, it is sad to note that certain quarters are \r\nundermining the peaceful resolution of the crisis by supplying weapons to the \r\nwarring factions instead of relief assistance to the suffering people of \r\nSomalia, or dumping industrial toxic waste on Somali territory instead of \r\nproviding medicine to take care of the sick and wounded, and plundering the \r\nlivestock and marine resources of Somalia instead of providing critically \r\nneeded humanitarian assistance. We call on these quarters to desist from \r\nattempts to polarize the region of the Horn of Africa and instead work with us \r\nin partnership in our efforts to restore lasting peace and stability in \r\nSomalia. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. Mesfin. Ethiopia) \r\nI should like now to turn to another issue of concern to us. We have \r\nbeen following closely the positive developments in South Africa. However, we \r\nstill have serious misgivings about the prospects for the peaceful \r\ntransformation of that country, as the system of apartheid remains in place. \r\nWe are deeply committed to the decisions and positions of the Organization of \r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and of the United Nations decisions and positions that \r\nhave been emphasized repeatedly over the years as well as to the principled \r\nstand of the democratic forces in South Africa to end the apartheid system \r\nonce and for all and set in motion an irreversible process of change to a \r\nmultiracial and democratic political order in that country. \r\nThe current efforts to create the conditions necessary for the success of \r\npeaceful negotiation should be encouraged. In this connection, the recent \r\nagreement between the African National Congress and the Government to resume \r\nnegotiations is a positive development, as is the release of political \r\nprisoners. We look forward to the initiation of talks between all the \r\ndemocratic forces in South Africa and the Government, with a view to the \r\nestablishment of an interim Government to supervise the process of preparing a \r\nconstitutional order for a multiracial and democratic South Africa. \r\nLikewise, we are gravely concerned about the tragic situation in the \r\nformer Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This crisis, which \r\nis fast getting out of control, is a serious threat to international peace and \r\nsecurity. The continuing bloodshed should be brought to an end and a \r\npolitical solution acceptable to all parties should be found as soon as \r\npossible. In this respect, we hope that the conference currently being held \r\nin Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations and the European Community \r\nwill have concrete results. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. Mesfin. Ethiopia) \r\nWe are also following the current peace process in the Middle East. \r\nDespite the international community\u0027s repeated efforts to broker peace, the \r\nsituation in the Middle East still hangs in the balance. Nevertheless, the \r\nprospects for peace in the area are better today than they have been for a \r\nlong time. We are therefore hopeful that the question of Palestine, which is \r\nat the core of the Middle East problem, will eventually be resolved in \r\naccordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions so that a just, \r\ndurable and comprehensive settlement for the region as a whole may be achieved. \r\nWe are gratified by the outcome of the efforts of the Conference on \r\nDisarmament with regard to chemical weapons. The draft treaty prohibiting the \r\nproduction, use, transfer and stockpiling of chemical weapons represents an \r\nimportant step in the global effort to eliminate weapons of mass destruction. \r\nWe derive special satisfaction from the success of nearly 25 years of effort \r\nin the disarmament process and from Ethiopia\u0027s contribution as a member of the \r\nConference on Disarmament. In view of current trends towards democracy and \r\nrespect for human rights, there is a need for the disarmament negotiations to \r\ninclude conventional weapons. It should be emphasized that the \"peace \r\ndividend\" from disarmament efforts should be channelled into fighting the \r\nproblems of poverty, disease and backwardness in developing countries. \r\nIt goes without saying that the opportunities created in the past few \r\nyears to secure a more just and stable international order cannot bear fruit \r\nunless there is a parallel effort, deployed with increased vigour, to bring \r\nabout positive change in international economic relations. In this regard, \r\nmuch more is expected from the United Nations. The United Nations Conference \r\non Environment and Development, held in Rio, Brazil, in the middle of this \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Mesfin. Ethiopia) \r\nyear demonstrated the great importance that the international community \r\nattaches to the pressing issues of the environment and development. \r\nEnvironmental protection and economic development bear on the future of \r\nmankind and affect every country. Therefore, our collective and individual \r\nstrategic planning activities should be aimed at solving these two global \r\nproblems, which call for effective international cooperation and mutual \r\nconsultation. The Rio Declaration and Agenda 21, as well as the two \r\nConventions, the Convention on climate change and the Convention on biological \r\ndiversity, lay a good foundation for enhanced international cooperation in \r\nthis area. However, there has yet to be sufficient focus on the problems of \r\nenvironmental pollution and ecological degradation and desertification. \r\nWe should like to share certain fundamental thoughts about the promotion \r\nand strengthening of democracy and democratic institutions in the context of \r\ncurrent international relations. Although democracy may have certain \r\nuniversal features, it is equally true that it has unique characteristics \r\npeculiar to a particular country\u0027s socio-political situation. In effect, \r\nthere cannot be a standard prescription for building democracy applicable to \r\nall societies and situations. Realization of this fact should restrain any \r\nattempt to prescribe uniform modalities and processes for the establishment of \r\ndemocracy and democratic institutions in different countries. \r\nIt is incumbent upon those who claim to stand for democracy to help newly \r\ndemocratizing peoples in their effort to consolidate that process, rather than \r\nconfine themselves to levelling criticism from the sidelines. If those forces \r\nthat advocate the strengthening of democracy fail to extend a helping hand to \r\nus in our unrelenting struggle to democratize our country, and instead simply \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n54-55 \r\n(Mr. Mesfin. Ethiopia) \r\nwatch from a distance, any weakening or failure of the process of \r\ndemocratization will be attributable, at least in part, to their lack of \r\ncooperation. \r\nIt goes without saying that democracy is unthinkable without peace and \r\nstability, both internal and inter-State. Thus support by the forces of \r\ndemocracy for internal democratization processes would be a significant step \r\nforward in the resolution of internal conflicts. Inter-State conflicts can be \r\nsettled by democratizing inter-State relations and by scrupulously observing \r\nnorms of international law for inter-State relations. Although the parties to \r\nan inter-State dispute are primarily responsible for the peaceful resolution \r\nof their problems, the United Nations and the international community can, and \r\nshould, play a significant role in encouraging the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes. Sanctions could be applied as a last resort against a recalcitrant \r\nparty violating basic norms of inter-State relations once all other attempts \r\nto resolve disputes had been fully exhausted. \r\nIt is evident that democracy cannot be nurtured and sustained to grow \r\ninto a robust institution in countries characterized by economic deprivation \r\nand destitution. It is therefore imperative to democratize the international \r\neconomic order with the same vigour as we are deploying to democratize the \r\ninternational political order, if we are to strengthen democracy and \r\ndemocratic institutions. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n56 \r\n(Mr. Mesfin. Ethiopia) \r\nTo this end, developing countries, as a whole, should be given assistance to \r\nextricate themselves from the quagmire of poverty and underdevelopment. \r\nFailure by the developed countries to do so would mean exacerbating \r\ninternational tension and conflict in a different form, thereby adversely \r\naffecting all our efforts towards lasting peace and socio-economic \r\ndevelopment. In order to forestall such an eventuality, the United Nations \r\nand the international community should go beyond paying lip-service to \r\ndemocracy and development and provide meaningful economic assistance to \r\ndeveloping countries. Only then will we be able to say that international \r\npeace and development are guaranteed. \r\nAt this juncture, allow me to say a few words on developments in Ethiopia \r\nsince the establishment of the Transitional Government just over a year ago. \r\nThe demise of the repressive military regime in May 1991, the assumption \r\nof power by democratic forces and the endorsement of the Transitional Charter \r\nhave heralded a new chapter in the history of our country in which freedom, \r\nequal rights and self-determination of all peoples are the guiding principles \r\nof political, economic and social life. \r\nDuring this short period, while striving to ensure durable peace and \r\nstability after 30 years of bloody civil war, we have been able to lay the \r\ngroundwork for the creation of a new political order in a country where very \r\nlittle was known about democratic political and institutional machinery. \r\nThe Transitional Charter laid the basis for the establishment of a \r\nbroad-based administration incorporating a wide spectrum of political views, \r\nregional interests and national aspirations. The Council of Representatives, \r\nwhich is the highest legislative authority, consists of dozens of political \r\nand social organizations. Morever, with a view to paving the way for the \r\nimplementation of the right to self-determination of all peoples in Ethiopia \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Mesfin. Ethiopia) \r\nas enshrined in our Transitional Charter, we have taken the the first \r\nsignificant step by holding the first successful democratic, local and \r\nregional elections in the country\u0027s history in the presence of international \r\nobservers. An administration aimed at the consolidation of peace, stability, \r\ndemocracy, reconstruction and development in the country is now firmly in \r\nplace. \r\nThe protection of human rights is at the top of the agenda of the \r\nTransitional Government. For the first time, internationally recognized human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms are fully guaranteed in Ethiopia. The \r\nTransitional Government is fully committed to upholding and protecting the \r\nrights of individuals and peoples based on the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nSights. To that end, we have initiated a process by which Ethiopia is to \r\naccede to the various international Covenants on human rights. \r\nThe Transitional Government of Ethiopia was established under \r\ncircumstances left by the country\u0027s former absolute dictatorship. It was a \r\nsituation where government accountability and responsibility were unknown, \r\ndemocratic culture and institutions were non-existent and where the country\u0027s \r\ninfrastructure was devastated by a long drawn-out war and recurrent drought \r\nand famine. \r\nAlthough the absence of a pluralistic political culture and institutional \r\nmachinery, as well as Ethiopia\u0027s only recent emergence from an extended period \r\nof intense civil war, has had a significant impact on democratization, in \r\ngeneral the process of democratization, decentralization and devolution of \r\npower in Ethiopia is right on track. However, this does not mean that the \r\ntransition from war to peace and from dictatorship to democracy is a smooth \r\n°ne. Indeed, we chose to go through a transition process with a view to \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr. Mesfin. Ethiopia) \r\nmaking it possible for us to lay down the necessary preconditions for a \r\nfull-fledged democratic order. We have made significant progress in all these \r\nareas during the past year of the transitional period. As part of the \r\ncontinuing process of democratization, the Council of Representatives has \r\nissued a proclamation on the setting up of a Constitution Drafting Commission, \r\nwhich is about to embark upon its important task as soon as organizational \r\nmatters are finalized. \r\nThe lesson we have drawn from the first year of the transitional period \r\nis that the establishment of democracy, dependable democratic institutions and \r\ndemocratic culture in a least developed country such as Ethiopia, with an \r\neconomy devastated by war and natural calamities, is an extermely arduous \r\nundertaking. However committed one may be or however strenously one may \r\nstrive to achieve this goal, the process is bound to be very slow and full of \r\ndifficulties and complications. This is not a sign of despair but an \r\nacknowledgment of a concrete reality, which is a necessary first step to \r\nsuccess in any undertaking. \r\nUndaunted by the adverse internal situation at the outset, the \r\nTransitional Government took, and is taking bold and decisive steps to lay the \r\ngroundwork for the socio-economic transformation and democratization of the \r\ncountry. Thus, building democratic institutions, carrying out major economic \r\nreforms, instituting human rights and fundamental freedoms previously unknown \r\nin Ethiopia, such as freedom of assembly and association, freedom of \r\nexpression without censorship, encouraging the formation of numerous political \r\norganizations which are now exercising democratic rights without any \r\nhindrance: these are only the most salient achievements of the Transitional \r\nGovernment in the brief period of one year. As a result, we can assert with \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n59-60 \r\n(Mr. Mesfin. Ethiopia) \r\nfull confidence that a new democratic culture and new democratic institutions \r\nare taking shape in our country today. \r\nThe unity of Ethiopia is being guaranteed on the basis of the unswerving \r\nrecognition and accommodation of diversity. Bold, and in many ways unique, \r\nsteps are again being taken to resolve the country\u0027s internal problems. \r\nAlthough problems may persist, our internal experiment aimed at their solution \r\nis already paying dividends. \r\nThe Eritrean question has also been resolved by the recognition of the \r\nright to self-determination of the Eritrean people. A referendum will be held \r\nearly next year in the presence of international observers, including the \r\nUnited Nations, to determine definitively the future status of Eritrea. \r\nThe decision to resolve the Eritrean question through a referendum has \r\nbeen subscribed to without reservation by both the Transitional Government of \r\nEthiopia and the Provisional Government of Eritrea. They have also declared \r\nin no uncertain terms that they will accept the results of the referendum. In \r\neffect, the decision is ours, and ours alone, and belongs in no way to any \r\nexternal force. We are confident that once the people of Eritrea have freely \r\ndecided their own future, no matter what the outcome of the referendum, the \r\nexisting and fast-developing economic, trade and social relations between the \r\ntwo peoples based on mutual trust and benefit will be the trail-blazer for \r\neconomic and social integration in the Horn of Africa subregion, which we hope \r\nwill materialize in the not-too-distant future. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n61 \r\n(Mr. Mesfin. Ethiopia) \r\nAs regards our economic situation, it has been repeatedly stated that \r\nEthiopia\u0027s economic potential contrasts sharply with its socio-economic \r\nunderdevelopment. In addition to drought, war and famine, the mismanagement \r\nof the national economy over the years by the former regime has militated \r\nagainst steady growth by the national economy. Under these rather difficult \r\ncircumstances, the transitional Government of Ethiopia has embarked upon a \r\ncomprehensive programme of new economic policy measures and institutional \r\nreform aimed at increasing the role of the private sector in the national \r\neconomy, and is rationalizing the public enterprises by improving their \r\nmanagement and generally allowing the promotion of market-economy principles \r\nand mechanisms. \r\nIt is imperative for us to exert the maximum effort to overcome the \r\nmultifaceted problems facing the country today and revitalize our national \r\neconomy. However, it is evident that such an undertaking calls for the \r\navailability of vast resources which cannot be mobilized at the national level \r\nalone. We therefore call on the international community to extend \r\nhumanitarian as well as development assistance to supplement our domestic \r\nefforts to cope with the emergency situation. The positive response and good \r\nwill demonstrated by various donor countries and international organizations \r\nover the past year in support of our economic recovery and reconstruction \r\nprogramme are encouraging. We are hopeful that that support will continue. \r\nThe changes under way in Ethiopia are having an impact on the country\u0027s \r\nexternal relations. Thus, for the first time in several decades, our \r\nrelations with all our neighbours in the Horn of Africa are being strengthened \r\non a qualitatively new level. Harmonious cooperation in all fields is fast \r\ndeveloping in our subregion. Our relations with other countries are also \r\ndeveloping on the some basis and are showing encouraging results. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Mesfin. Ethiopia) \r\nIn this new experiment of nation-building, Ethiopia has from the outset \r\nenjoyed the good will of many countries. Some have also extended material \r\nassistance. We wish to express our deep gratitude to all who have helped us \r\nin one way or another. Nevertheless, we have, regrettably, to admit the fact \r\nthat the assistance we have so far received, in particular material \r\nassistance, falls short of what is needed to make our effort at socio-economic \r\ndevelopment a success. We therefore call again upon all our friends to \r\nprovide us with meaningful assistance at this crucial phase in our history. \r\nIn conclusion, I should also like to reiterate Ethiopia\u0027s readiness to \r\nparticipate in all endeavours aimed at enhancing the role of our Organization \r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security and in assisting the \r\ndeveloping countries in their efforts to achieve a greater degree of economic \r\ndevelopment and self-reliance. I am hopeful that at the present session the \r\nAssembly will review and assess the world situation with a new perspective and \r\ntake a bold approach in order to meet the imperatives of the time. We must \r\nencourage and promote the positive trends already evident in international \r\nrelations, and at the same time guard against certain tendencies which \r\npatently carry within them the seed of new crises. \r\nMr. ABDURAZZAKOV (Uzbekistan) (interpretation from Russian): Let me \r\nmost cordially join in congratulating the President of the General Assembly at \r\nits forty-seventh session. \r\nFor the first time, the delegation of the Republic of Uzbekistan is \r\ntaking part in the work of the United Nations General Assembly as an \r\nindependent State. It is an honour for us to express our sincere gratitude to \r\nall State Members of the United Nations for the support and cooperation they \r\nhave given the young independent Republic of Uzbekistan. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. Abdurazzakov. Uzhekist-an) \r\nWe are very grateful to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his \r\nconstant attention to our region. The decision to open at Tashkent an office \r\nrepresenting the United Nations and a number of its specialized organizations \r\nis clear evidence of that attention. This approach arises from the main \r\norientation of United Nations activities at the present time, which were \r\nformulated in concentrated form by the Secretary-General in his report \"An \r\nAgenda for Peace\" (A/47/277). \r\nRecently the people of Uzbekistan solemnly marked the first anniversary \r\nof its independence. The fact that now we have begun building an independent \r\nState is the logical result of the constant and selfless struggle for \r\nindependence waged over the centuries by our people and its best sons. \r\nAchieving independence has never been easy anywhere in the world. For \r\nthat reason our year of independence is only the beginning of a long process. \r\nWe are laying the groundwork for an independent Uzbek State. \r\nWe have saved our language, religion, traditions, customs and moral \r\nprinciples from the danger of complete disappearance; we are fully \r\nreincarnating our national values. Our natural resources, together with the \r\neconomic, scientific, technical and moral potential built up by the labour of \r\nprevious generations, can serve as a guarantee for the social and economic \r\ndevelopment of independent Uzbekistan. \r\nTo turn this potential into a real force, our Republic, under the \r\nleadership of President Islam Karimov, is working out an appropriate system; \r\nit\u0027is looking\u0027for the best structure of governmental administration and for \r\nf \r\nways to develop the economy and to construct its foreign and domestic \r\npolicies. Measures are being taken for the social protection of the \r\npopulation against the shocks that are inevitable in the transition to a \r\nmarket economy, to a society which is new to us. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n64-65 \r\n(Mr. Abdurazzakov. Uzbekistan) \r\nIn the process of building an independent State, we are utilizing the \r\npositive experience accumulated by other developed nations and based on \r\nopenness and market relations. Of course, in so doing we are taking into \r\nconsideration, first and foremost, the specific features and concrete \r\ncircumstances of our country and the national and cultural traditions of the \r\npeople who live there. \r\nWe seek to create a social and political structure under which the \r\nprinciples of human rights and freedom will be stricted observed. Our State \r\npolicy is designed to protect the interests and rights of all peoples, \r\nirrespective of their nationalities, religion or beliefs, to preserve and \r\ndevelop their cultures, languages, national traditions and customs and to \r\ninvolve them actively in State and public life. \r\nWe have firmly rejected the domination of any one ideology or any one \r\nworld view; in fact, we are establishing a multiparty system as an essential \r\nand logical element of genuine democracy. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n66 \r\n(Mr. Abdurazzakov. \r\nUzbekistan) \r\nAt the same time, we are outlawing those forces and movements that \r\nattempt through blackmail, threats and violence to change the structure of the \r\nState, that endanger the territorial integrity and security of our Republic, \r\nthat sow ethnic and religious dissension, that encroach on the constitutional \r\nsystem and the moral foundations of our people\u0027s life. We require the \r\nactivities of all forces and movements to remain within the limits of the law. \r\nIn our economic policy, we reject the structure based on the command \r\nadministration system, which is highly centralized and distributive. We \r\ncompletely reject ideology. Equal rights apply to all types of property. \r\nOf course, there are difficulties being encountered in carrying out our \r\npolitical and economic programmes. This is something we all recognize. \r\nToday our people is going through a difficult period of transition. This \r\nis due to the fact that for many years our republic was the victim of a policy \r\nof repression and diktat, resulting in a dependent economy and making our \r\nregion a raw-materials appendage. \r\nIt is not easy to rescue our people from the consequences of the \r\ntotalitarian hegemony of communist ideas. Certainly, a new and just society \r\ncannot be created in a day, or even in a year. We understand all this clearly. \r\nThe most important thing is that, on the basis of inter-ethnic accord and \r\nunity among our citizens, we have established a stable social and political \r\nsituation in our country. \r\nThe peoples of our region. Central Asia - Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Turkmans, \r\nKyrgyzes and Tajiks - are the children of common forefathers. We share the \r\nsame land and water, the same religion, the same history and the same fate; we \r\nshare the same cares, joys and anxieties. Historically, we have always been \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n67 \r\n(Mr. Abdurazzakov. \r\nUzbekistan) \r\nnaturally connected and interdependent. We created our common history through \r\ncooperation. Many of our internal problems are evolving; they could easily \r\nbecome inter-ethnic or international problems, affecting the interests of the \r\npeoples of our region. This is what is special about the general situation \r\nand the international position of Uzbekistan and of Central Asia as a whole. \r\nAt present the Government and the people of Uzbekistan are deeply \r\nconcerned about the course of events in Tajikistan, which is on the brink of \r\ncivil war. The serious international danger is that armed clashes between the \r\nopposing forces, which have claimed thousands of lives among the peaceful \r\npopulation, could easily spread to neighbouring Central Asian States. \r\nIn the Central Asian region, with its dense population of over \r\n50 million, such an armed conflict could have unpredictable consequences. \r\nShould the conflict spread, the peoples of Central Asia could be involved in \r\nan endless fratricidal war, which could ultimately destroy the freedom and \r\nindependence they have recently won. That is why the current situation is \r\ndangerous for us. We have every reason to be concerned. \r\nIn practice, the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, where there \r\nare hundreds of thousands of men under arms, remains open. The actions of \r\nextremists and fanatical armed groups incited by those who are playing on \r\npeople\u0027s national and religious feelings could have unpredictable consequences. \r\nUzbekistan strongly opposes interference in the internal affairs of \r\nindependent Tajikistan and is against stirring up the fire of war. Uzbekistan \r\nadvocates preventing the spread of the armed conflict and finding a solution \r\nas quickly as possible by peaceful and civilized means. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n68 \r\n(Mr. Abdurazzakov. \r\nUzbekistan) \r\nUzbekistan supports the appeal of the Government of Tajikistan to the \r\nUnited Nations to provide assistance in finding a solution to the grave \r\ncrisis, which could become international in scope. Uzbekistan regards as \r\ndecisive in the present circumstances the role of the United Nations and the \r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Fully aware of the danger \r\nof the situation, and in a spirit of humanity, and, at the same time, of \r\nresponsibility for the fate of our peoples, Uzbekistan has requested \r\nSecretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to examine the situation and inform \r\nthe Security Council, and various United Nations committees and commissions, \r\nof our concern. \r\nThe President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, in his letter \r\naddressed to Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali, stressed that only timely and \r\neffective assistance by the international community can be decisive in \r\nsupporting the process of democratization and the political and economic \r\nreforms under way in the new independent States of the region. \r\nIn proposing this initiative, Uzbekistan proceeds from the concept that \r\nthe predominant idea of the new international order should be the prevention \r\nof aggression and conflicts and the establishment of democratic machinery for \r\nmaking such an order a reality. That concept was convincingly expounded as \r\npreventive diplomacy by Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. In our view \r\nthe guarantee for such preventive action can be found in cooperation in the \r\nbroad sense of the term. \r\nA/47/PV.25 \r\n69 \r\n(Mr. Abdurazzakov. \r\nUzbekistan) \r\nI think that what I have said is sufficient for an understanding of the \r\nneed to create a United Nations Eastern Centre in our region with the aim of \r\nextending the principles of the world community and international norms to the \r\ncentral part of the Eurasian continent. I believe that Tashkent, as a \r\nhistoric centre of that region, with its rich past and its modern experience \r\nin peacemaking activities, would be fully worthy of the honour of serving as \r\nthe seat of the Eastern Centre. That would provide the world community with \r\nreliable information on the processes of social development in the region, \r\nexpedite the solution of its problems and make it a zone free of conflicts. \r\nIn our view, that is the main goal of the United Nations and the new \r\nworld order. \r\nThe meeting rose at 5.35 p.m. \r\n"
