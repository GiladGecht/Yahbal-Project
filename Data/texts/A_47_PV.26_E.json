Namibia) \r\nThis world order, the optimists proclaimed, would be governed by the rule \r\nof law, respect for human rights, universal exercise of the right to \r\nself-determination, recognition of the equality of all nations, large and \r\nsmall, and sharing among the members of the human family. On this basis it \r\nwas fair to expect that the great achievements in science and technology could \r\ngenerously be utilized to assure the common survival of humanity, protection \r\nof the environment and the unfettered enjoyment of larger freedoms by every \r\nindividual on this planet Earth. \r\nAfter all, the founding fathers themselves made a solemn pledge in the \r\nCharter \r\n\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in \r\nour lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind\". \r\nTheir vision of a peaceful and harmonious world and peoples\u0027 hopes for social \r\nadvancement and economic prosperity have had a common source: total revulsion \r\nagainst war, destruction and darkness. \r\nForty-seven years later, reflecting on the intervening years, we note \r\nthat the world has witnessed more, not fewer, incidents of just and unjust \r\nwars, regional conflicts, racial and ethnic strife, acute forms of human \r\nsuffering, environmental degradation and an unmitigated endangerment of life \r\nitself. \r\nNamibia joined other member States of the Movement of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries at its Summit in Jakarta in stating that \r\n\"the world today is far from being a peaceful, just and secure place. \r\nSimmering disputes, violent conflicts, aggression and foreign occupation, \r\ninterference in the internal affairs of States, policies of hegemony and \r\ndomination, ethnic strife, religious intolerance, new forms of racism and \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n7 \r\n(Mr. Gurirab. Namibia) \r\nnarrowly conceived nationalism are major and dangerous obstacles to \r\nharmonious coexistence among States and peoples and have even led to the \r\ndisintegration of States and societies.\" \r\nNuclear conflagration, thank heavens, has not occurred, but the world is \r\nfar from being a peaceful and secure place. History does indeed repeat \r\nitself, at least some of the time, if not most of the time. \r\nLet me add to this assessment one more observation made in Jakarta by an \r\neminent Asian leader. His view, which is consistent with our own, was: \r\n\"We must also ensure that the new world order to which the leaders of the \r\nindustrialised countries often refer does not turn out to be but a new \r\nversion of the same old patterns of domination of the strong over the \r\nweak and the rich over the poor.\" \r\nFor the new world order to be universally acceptable, it should be genuine in \r\nits import and distinct from the old unjust and undemocratic order, and it \r\nshould show a way forward towards greater human solidarity and cooperation. \r\nAt this very moment, in South Africa, Somalia, Liberia, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, Cambodia and various parts of the former Soviet Union and \r\nelsewhere in the world millions of victims languish in perpetual tragedy. \r\nThis carnage includes innocent and defenceless men, women and children who are \r\nkilled by guns or hunger. The current state of world affairs hardly \r\nencourages confidence and optimism about our common future. One need not be a \r\ncynic to hold this view. \r\nMy delegation is delighted to see our illustrious Secretary-General \r\noccupying a lofty place in the United Nations Organization at this critical \r\ntime of a changing global environment. It was Africa\u0027s pride and \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali\u0027s own crowning personal achievement when he was \r\nunanimously elected last year as the first African Secretary-General of our \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n8 \r\n(Mr. Gurirab. Namibia) \r\nOrganization. We commend him for his courage and initiative and for the manner \r\nin which he has so ably carried out his daunting tasks. \r\nNamibia welcomes the Secretary-General\u0027s \"Agenda for Peace\". Many of the \r\nideas and recommendations contained in it coincide with those emanating from \r\nbodies such as the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, the Commonwealth and others, notably the Nordic States, which some \r\ntime ago circulated their views on the United Nations reform process. \r\nWith this in mind, Namibia is alive to a suggestion made from this \r\nrostrum, and endorsed by other delegations, that a special meeting of the \r\nSecurity Council be convened to consider the Secretary-General\u0027s proposals. If \r\nand when this suggestion is carried out and the proposed meeting takes place, \r\nwe expect the Secretary-General and the members of the Security Council to \r\ntake into consideration the contributions I have mentioned and to ensure that \r\nthe intended consultations are inclusive and transparent. There ought to be a \r\ncareful balance between the need for a renewed commitment to strengthen \r\nmechanisms for maintaining world peace and security, on the one hand, and a \r\nfocus on the burning issues of poverty and other forms of socio-economic \r\ninjustice, on the other. \r\nIn this context, I should like to refer to a bold initiative taken by the \r\nSecretary-General of the OAU, Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim. I have in mind his \r\nproposed creation of an institutional mechanism, within the OAU General \r\nSecretariat, to deal promptly and effectively with conflict management, \r\nprevention and resolution in respect of the eruption of major crises, similar \r\nto those now prevailing in Somalia and Liberia, in any African State. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n9-10 \r\n(Mr. Gurirab. Namibia) \r\nThere is also a companion set of proposals in a package entitled \"The \r\nKampala Document\", which is the product of a meeting held last year in \r\nKampala, Uganda, devoted to guestions of security, stability, development and \r\nco-operation in Africa. These proposals, in our view, are serious and \r\npractical innovations by Africans themselves to confront major political and \r\nsecurity crises as and when they occur in any part of Africa, and we \r\nwholeheartedly endorse them. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n11 \r\n(Mr. Gurirab, Namibia) \r\nThe United Nations Charter itself devotes its chapter VIII to regional \r\narrangements or agencies for dealing with issues such as peace, security and \r\nconflict, and encourages appropriate action which is consistent with the \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations. The current Secretary-General \r\nhimself lamented the fact that the \"cold war had impaired the proper \r\nactivation of this key provision of the Charter and also the fact that\", to \r\nparaphrase him, rather than helping to resolve regional conflicts super-Powers \r\nactually managed to exacerbate them for their own selfish ends. \r\nQuite clearly, there is a linkage between the priority agendas of the \r\nSecretaries-General of the United Nations and of the Organization of African \r\nUnity, and this is, as a matter of fact, in keeping with the long-standing \r\nco-operation between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. \r\nMr. President, at this juncture I should like to address a few words to \r\nyou personally. May I begin by stating that your own unanimous election and \r\nthe critical role required of your office become not only propitious on the \r\ntime-scale of the global agenda, as evidenced by the items for discussion \r\nduring the current session of the Assembly, but equally by affording an ideal \r\nopportunity to you boldly and unambiguously to articulate the concerns and \r\naspirations of the poor and developing Members of this Organization. \r\nIt gives me great pleasure, therefore, on behalf of the Government and \r\npeople of Namibia, to extend congratulations to you upon your brilliant \r\nelection. I have no doubt in my mind that, given your diplomatic skills and \r\nvast practical experience, our deliberations will be crowned with success. \r\nOur two friendly countries enjoy excellent relations, and I extend best wishes \r\nto you. \r\nTo your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Shamir S. Shihabi of the Kingdom \r\n°f Saudi Arabia, I say many congratulations for a job well done, and I should \r\nlike to wish him great success and happiness in his future endeavours. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n12 \r\n(Mr. Gurirab. Namibia) \r\nThe long cherished ideal of the universality of our Organization has been \r\nfurther enhanced as more and more new nations have joined its membership. As \r\nthis world becomes unavoidably interdependent and we collectively realize that \r\nthe world is truly a global village, increasingly high expections are now \r\nbeing placed in the United Nations. This is yet another reason why the \r\nOrganization needs to be further revitalized and genuinely democratized. \r\nThe world\u0027s contemporary challenges stemming from rapidly changing \r\ninter-State relations and social problems cannot be adequately dealt with by \r\nthe United Nations without fundamental institutional and procedural reforms, \r\nincluding the revision of its Charter. It is in this context that Namibia \r\nwelcomes all the new Members and wishes them well, while assuring them of our \r\ndesire to promote close co-operation with all of them in a spirit of \r\nfriendship and peaceful coexistence. \r\nThe Rio Earth Summit made the matter abundantly clear: that global \r\neconomic development and environmental protection go hand in hand. \r\nDevelopment must be based on the sustainable utilization of the environment \r\nfor the sake of this and all future generations. \r\nNamibia\u0027s Constitution contains a special provision on this crucial \r\nsubject. It states: \r\n\"The State shall actively promote and maintain the welfare of the \r\npeople by adopting, inter alia, policies aimed at ... the maintenance of \r\necosystems, essential ecological processes and biological diversity of \r\nNamibia and utilization of living natural resources on a sustainable \r\nbasis for the benefit of all Namibians, both present and future; in \r\nparticular, the Government shall provide measures against the dumping or \r\nrecycling of foreign nuclear and toxic wastf on Namibian territory.\" \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n13-15 \r\n(Mr. Gurirab. Namibia) \r\nMoreover, it further charges the Ombudsman with the duty \r\n\"to investigate complaints concerning the over-utilization of living \r\nnatural resources, the irrational exploitation of non-renewable \r\nresources, the degradation and destruction of ecosystems and failure to \r\nprotect the beauty and character of Namibia.\" \r\nTowards implementing environment-friendly policies which aim at \r\nsustainable development, the Government had, prior to the Rio Earth Summit, \r\nadopted a \"Green Plan\" for Namibia that outlines a comprehensive framework for \r\ndevelopment in accordance with sustainable environmental principles. The Plan \r\nelaborates on the Government\u0027s approach to our ecological challenges and the \r\nconscientious management of our natural resources and national assets. \r\nDuring the days of apartheid colonialism and foreign exploitation, both \r\nrenewable and non-renewable resources that provided the very basis of the \r\neconomy were subjected to ruthless plunder mainly for the benefit of \r\nforeigners. The Government has taken steps to put an end to this disastrous \r\nsituation. Many in the developing world, Namibia foremost among them, depend \r\non these resources for daily subsistence, and unless there are going to be \r\nalternatives for dealing with debilitating problems such as the debt burden, \r\nthe foreign exchange dilemma and technological backwardness, many of us are, \r\nsad to say, bound to remain in a perpetual state of poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment. This would in turn mean further degrading the environment \r\nand endangering our very existence. \r\nIt follows that what is required now is an undertaking to speed up \r\nimplementation of Agenda 21, adopted in Rio. Its financing, it must be \r\nstressed, is not only to assist the developing countries to fight poverty and \r\ncreate jobs but equally to protect the ecosystem itself, which is very vital \r\nfor the survival of humankind. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n16 \r\n(Mr. Gurirab. NaminiM \r\nIn the same vein, let me add that Namibia, being a dry, semi-desert \r\ncountry, endorses the proposed convention on combating desertification and \r\nurges that the preparation of the international convention on desertification \r\nbe undertaken during the current session. \r\nThis brings me to the next topic, namely the current drought and acute \r\nsituation of hunger and suffering which has afflicted the whole of the \r\nsouthern African subregion. Crop production, livestock farming and our \r\nefforts to become food-sufficient and to achieve security have suffered \r\nseverely. The Government established a National Committee on Drought to \r\nensure, inter alia, better coordination and more efficient delivery of water \r\nand food to the most needy sections of the population and the sustenance of \r\nthe livestock and game. An initial amount of 120 million rand was budgeted \r\nfor these vital schemes. \r\nFurthermore, in addition to these national efforts, we have also made a \r\nspecial appeal to the international community and, generally speaking, the \r\nresponse has been prompt and helpful, for which Namibia is exceedingly \r\ngrateful. \r\nA regional effort is under way which involves both the sharing of data \r\nand the coordinating of programmes and communication and transport facilities, \r\ncoupled with the assistance received from the United Nations system, \r\nintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and individuals around \r\nthe world. \r\nIn this cdnnection, I should like to express a special word of \r\ncommendation and appreciation to Sir Ketumile Masire, President of the \r\nRepublic of Botswana, and to the secretariat of Southern African Development \r\nCoordination Conference (SADCC) for having taken timely and decisive steps \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n17 \r\n(Mr. Gurirab. Namibia) \r\nwith a view to sensitizing and mobilizing the international community as to \r\nthe plight of all our peoples in the subregion and for co-sponsoring an \r\nimportant conference on the situation in Geneva early this year. Of course, \r\nwe all remain hopeful that there will be early and abundant rains this year, \r\nand in all subsequent years, as this will, no doubt, mean saving lives. I \r\nthought I should also add here a point which, with each passing day, is \r\nbecoming more and more clear to all Namibians. This has to do with finding, \r\npreserving, planning and distributing water resources, as being perhaps the \r\nsingle most precious primary commodity needed to keep us going and sustain \r\nlife itself. \r\nThe realization that the world is a global village and one market-place \r\nwith interlocking financial institutions and credit arrangements underlines \r\nthe internationalization of the world economy. \r\nNamibia, being one of the poorest countries in the South, must continue \r\nto raise its voice, in unison with other memoers of the non-aligned movement \r\nand the rest of the developing countries, in favour of the creation of a new \r\nand just international economic order. The call for global economic \r\nrestructuring and reform is a legitimate demand, which should find its place \r\namong the top priorities on the agenda of this and other international forums. \r\nThe ending of the cold war, as it is alleged, and the emergence of a \r\nso-called new world order, characterized in part by the rapprochement of the \r\nnuclear Powers, have engendered a peculiar, new cilture of economic blackmail \r\nand sabotage. Powerful and rich countries have lately tended to tamper with \r\nthe sovereignty of weaker and poorer nations by using the power of the purse \r\nand by laying down some stringent conditions. This is being done supposedly \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n18 \r\n(Mr. Gurirab. Namibia) \r\nto promote democracy, transparency in governance and public accountability a \r\nsituation which leads to unilateral and often punitive actions just to prove a \r\npoint. To us, it unfortunately constitutes an arbitrary and precipitous \r\nexercise of power and judgement. \r\nAs Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, the former Chairman of the South Commission, \r\nput it recently on another occasion: \r\n\"these events have had two very important consequences for the South, and \r\nall the countries of it. First, they increase the urgency of developing \r\ncountries building national self-reliance and increasing their economic \r\nco-operation in all fields. Secondly, the triumphant West now believes \r\nthat its success in the cold war gives it the right as well as the \r\nuntrammelled power aggressively to promote its economic and political \r\nphilosophy throughout the South. \r\n\"Directly, and through international finance and trade institutions \r\ncontrolled by the wealthy States, and sometimes by embargoes or even \r\npolitical intervention, the North is therefore forcing developing \r\ncountries of the South to conform to the patterns it designs. \r\n\"At the same time protectionism of different kinds is increasing in \r\nthe North, and our separate weakness is being used to ride roughshod over \r\nour opinions in international negotiations as well as in bilateral \r\nSouth-North discussions.\" \r\nHow can one disagree with this poignant observation? \r\nThe non-aligned Movement which represents the majority of humankind \r\nis an ideal forum for the developing countries within which to plan and act \r\ntogether on issues, including the important issues which preoccupy the United \r\nNations. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n19-20 \r\n(Mr. Gurirab. Namibia) \r\nAllow me, once again, to cite Mwalimu\u0027s wise and telling words when he \r\nasserted thus: \r\n\"We need a Movement of the South to speak for the rights of the countries \r\nof the South. At present what we have is the Non-Aligned Movement, and \r\nfor United Nations negotiating purposes the Group of 77. Why then is \r\nthere this talk of the Non-Aligned Movement no longer being needed?\" \r\nThis, I believe, remains the inescapable reality, whether the world was or is \r\nbipolar or unipolar. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n21 \r\n(Mr. Gurirab. Namibia) \r\nOn the situation in South Africa, Namibia expresses support for and \r\nsolidarity with the liberation movements and all the democratic forces inside \r\nthat violence-torn neighbouring country. That is why we felt gratified, and \r\nparticipated in the debate, when the issue of the raging violence in South \r\nAfrica was brought to the Security Council last July. \r\nOur emphasis in our statement was that, now that the United Nations had \r\nbecome engaged in the situation, its presence should be prolonged and the size \r\nof its team increased in order to monitor the violence and assist in the \r\ntransition to a democratic, non-racial and united South Africa. For now, the \r\nsituation remains explosive and dangerous and, therefore, warrants the \r\ncontinuation of international pressure on the South African Government. \r\nIn the meantime, we call upon Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi of the \r\nInkatha Freedom Party to rejoin Comrade Nelson Mandela, President de Klerk and \r\nhis other compatriots in the negotiations, with the establishment and \r\nconsolidation of peace as the first prerequisite, and the adoption of a \r\ndemocratic constitution as the next step in the transition. \r\nFor the first time in their history, our Angolan neighbours went to the \r\npolls on 29 and 30 September, in multiparty elections, to choose a party and \r\ncandidates who must now install a new Government. It has not been easy, but \r\nthe sheer will and determination of the voters and monitors alike have \r\nconfounded many a cynic who believed that it would be impossible to hold free \r\nand fair elections in Angola. Namibia sees this is a great victory for the \r\nAngolan people,-and congratulates them. It also congratulates the leaders of \r\nall the political parties on believing in their people\u0027s political maturity \r\nand accepting the final verdict of the ballot-box. Namibia once again gives \r\nits assurance that it will continue to work closely with the Government of the \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n22 \r\n(Mr. Gurirab. Namibia) \r\nday in that sisterly and friendly country, on the basis of friendship and for \r\nthe benefit of both countries. \r\nThe Government of President Chissano and RENAMO finally sat down together \r\nin Rome and signed a ceasefire agreement to end the fighting in Mozambique and \r\nrebuild the country. We congratulate both President Joaquim Chissano and \r\nMr. Afonso Dhlakama on demonstrating political will and for giving the \r\nMozambican people hope and confidence in their future. They deserve our full \r\nand hearty congratulations on this momentous achievement, and we wish them \r\nfurther success as they work for the adoption of a new constitution and for \r\nthe restoration of peace and order in their country. \r\nMany helpers and interlocutors made this achievement possible. They \r\ninclude the Italian hosts and, in particular, the United Nations. But I \r\nshould like to commend Presidents Mugabe and Masire for their mediation \r\nefforts, which have paid off, to the great happiness of all Africans and their \r\nwell-wishers around the world. There was one more key player: Mr. Pik Botha, \r\nthe South African Foreign Minister, who was very active during the final, \r\ndelicate hours, thereby securing the signing of the cease-fire agreement. \r\nNamibia is also pleased to acknowledge his contribution. \r\nAs regards the situation in Somalia, Namibia supports the request of \r\nPresident Abdou Diouf of the Republic of Senegal, current Chairman of the \r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), that an international conference on the \r\nhuman disaster in that African country be convened as a matter of the utmost \r\nurgency. As the United Nations Secretary-General himself has put it, \r\n\"when it comes to death and misery, no one situation takes priority over \r\nanother.\" (A/47/1, para. 116) \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n23 \r\n(Mr. Gurirab. Namihia) \r\nOn the situation in Western Sahara, Namibi supports the principle of \r\nself-determination for the Saharan people. To this end, we endorse the \r\nefforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to remove all \r\nthe obstacles and help resolve disputes about the criteria for eligibility to \r\nvote in the referendum, and thus to advance the process. \r\nLikewise, Namibia has always held the view that the political \r\naspirations, and in particular the right to self-determination, of the \r\nPalestinian people, led by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), are at \r\nthe core of the conflict in the Middle East. Here we include the \r\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State, in accordance with Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). The season of peace and \r\ndialogue has arrived. In the present circumstances, that is the only viable \r\nand sensible game in town. If a face-to-face meeting between the President of \r\nSyria and the Prime Minister of Israel will give further impetus to the Middle \r\nEast peace process and pave the way towards a just, comprehensive and lasting \r\nsettlement, Namibia will strongly encourage such a historic undertaking within \r\nthe framework of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). \r\nIran and the United Arab Emirates two sisterly and friendly \r\nneighbours - ought not to allow the present misunderstandings to be magnified \r\nbeyond the confines of their bilateral relations. Rather, they should resolve \r\nthose misunderstandings through dialogue and by peaceful means. \r\nHappily, Kuwait is going ahead with the consolidation of peace and the \r\nreconstruction of the country. Namibia expresses its unswerving solidarity \r\nwith its Kuwaiti friends, and extends best wishes to them. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n24-25 \r\n(Mr. Gurirab. Namibia) \r\nThe carnage in Bosnia and Herzegovina is but the latest instance of man\u0027s \r\ninhumanity to man. Whether it takes place under the banner of the notorious \r\n\"ethnic cleansing\" or as religious retribution, this ugly tragedy cannot be \r\nallowed to continue. \r\nIn and around the Korean peninsula, we see steady movement by all the \r\nparties concerned in favour of dialogue, while de-emphasizing confrontation \r\nand military solutions. This is indeed good news for world peace and \r\nsecurity. The reunification of Korea is no longer an unthinkable goal, as the \r\nNorth and the South of that divided nation earnestly continue to regularise \r\nhigh-level meetings and to encourage families to interact freely. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n26 \r\n(Mr. Gurirab. Namibia) \r\nWe urge the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, \r\nwith both of which Namibia maintains excellent diplomatic and cooperative \r\nrelations, to remain engaged in those critical discussions until an amicable \r\nand peaceful solution is found. \r\nPeace and reconciliation in Cambodia are yet to be realized. Inspired by \r\nthe success of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in \r\nNamibia, we hope and pray that the ongoing United Nations Transitional \r\nAuthority in Cambodia (UNTAC) operation in that troubled country, too, will be \r\ncrowned with huge success. \r\nIn concluding my statement, I would be remiss if I did not give an update \r\nto the General Assembly and the Secretary-General on the outstanding dispute \r\nbetween Namibia and South Africa on Walvis Bay and the offshore islands. As \r\nthe matter stands now, a joint transitional administration of a limited \r\nduration will be established over these territories on 1 November 1992. It \r\nwill be known as the Joint Administrative Authority and headed by two Chief \r\nExecutives, one Namibian and one South African. In the meantime, the two \r\nGovernments will keep the negotiations going on the core issue of \r\nre-integration, in accordance with Security Council resolution 432 (1978). \r\nFinally, may I also inform the Assembly that Namibia became the one \r\nhundred and fifth member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) \r\non 15 September 1992 and also acceded to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty \r\n(NPT) and deposited the instruments to this effect with the designated \r\nauthorities. \r\nMr• ROMULO (Philippines): It is with special pleasure that the \r\nGovernment and the people of the Philippines extend to you, Sir, their warm \r\nfelicitations on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nthis session. You were one of the most prominent and vigorous advocates \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n27 \r\n(Mr. Romulo. Philippines) \r\nof freedom and democracy in your country. We in the Philippines watched your \r\nstruggle with interest and sympathy, and we joined the rest of the world in \r\napplauding the triumph of that struggle as the triumph of us all. That \r\ntriumph led to your elevation to the high office you now hold in your country \r\nand, now, to your election as President of the General Assembly. Your \r\nelection, therefore, is a source of special satisfaction for us. \r\nAt the same time, we congratulate your predecessor. His Excellency \r\nAmbassador Samir S. Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for his excellent \r\nleadership in presiding over the Assembly at its forty-sixth session. \r\nMy delegation also warmly welcomes Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. He brings \r\nto his arduous and exalted mission decades of experience in and deep insight \r\ninto the relations among nations and the nature and work of the United \r\nNations. In less than a year in office, Mr. Boutros-Ghali has demonstrated \r\nnot only an unflinching devotion to the work of our Organization but also a \r\nkeen sense of the direction it must take in dealing with the great \r\ninternational issues of our time. \r\nPermit me at this point to express the heartfelt appreciation and \r\ngratitude of the Philippine Government and of the Filipino people for the \r\ngenerous assistance extended by the members of the world community and \r\ninternational organizations to the hundreds of thousands of victims of floods \r\nand mud flows from Mt. Pinatubo, whose fury has described by scientists as \r\n\"the volcanic eruption of the century\". Their dire prediction is that \r\nMt. Pinatubo\u0027s mud flows, which have already buried towns and villages and \r\nturned the once green fields of Central Luzon into a grey and desolate \r\nlandscape, will continue its destruction for several more years. As we embark \r\non large-scale relief and rehabilitation efforts in the affected areas, my \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n28 \r\n(Mr. Romulo. Philippines) \r\nGovernment would like once more to appeal for assistance from the members of \r\nthe international community and organizations even as we thank them for the \r\nhelp already extended since Mt. Pinatubo erupted in June 1991. \r\nWe hold this session of the General Assembly at a moment in history that \r\nhas seen the wave of democracy and national freedom sweep the world with \r\nastounding and unprecedented rapidity. This is manifested by, among others, \r\nthe roster of new countries admitted to the United Nations this year nations \r\nnewly emerged from the confining and oppressive darkness of totalitarian \r\nimperialism: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, \r\nKazakhstan, Krygyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, Slovenia, Tajikistan and \r\nTurkmenistan. This list of new States, new Members of the United Nations, \r\nreads like a roll of honour in the annals of freedom in our era. We welcome \r\nthem, as we also do San Marino, to these halls. \r\nWe Filipinos take pride in having been early in the ranks of democracy\u0027s \r\nmarch in recent history. In 1986, through the exercise of people power, we \r\nrestored the institutions of democracy in our country. This democratic \r\nrestoration found both fulfilment and renewed strength in the national \r\nelections our people conducted five months ago and in the peaceful transfer of \r\npower that resulted from the supreme exercise of the democratic process. \r\nThe very fact of that peaceful transfer of power through free elections \r\nhas affirmed, for all to see, the political stability of our land and, no \r\ndoubt, contributed to the climate of peace and stability in our region. \r\nIn pursuance of national stability and peace, our new leadership, under \r\nPresident Fidel V. Ramos, has embarked on a policy and mission of \r\nreconciliation among our people, closing divisions, healing wounds and \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n29-30 \r\n(Mr. Romulo. Philippines) \r\nreaching out to all. Among the measures we have taken is the granting of \r\namnesty to those disaffected groups which had takan the path of rebellion of \r\nwhatever ideological or religious persuasion they might be, to whatever \r\norganizational or ethnic affiliation they might belong. \r\nElected under the banner of people empowerment, our new leadership has \r\nchosen, through its policies, to ride the crest of the wave of economic \r\nliberalization that has inexorably rolled across the world and has, in so many \r\nnations, improved so many lives in so short a time. We have chosen this path \r\nfor the same reason others have done because we believe that it is the best \r\nroad to sustained economic growth and a better life for our people. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n31 \r\n(Mr. Romulo. Philippines) \r\nOur new leadership, immediately upon assuming office, committed itself \r\nunequivocally to the liberalization of our trading regime and of the rules \r\ngoverning investments in our country. We have removed virtually all \r\nforeign-exchange controls, thus facilitating the international movement of \r\ncurrency. The privatization of key public industries proceeds apace. \r\nConsistent with the new primacy of commerce and economics in relations between \r\nnations, we have placed trade and economic relations at the top of our \r\ndiplomatic priorities. \r\nOnly a few weeks ago, in Jakarta, the capital city of our Indonesian \r\nneighbour, we joined the Non-Aligned Movement, in which the Philippines had \r\nbeen an observer for many years. Far from being rendered irrelevant by the \r\nend of the cold war, the Non-Aligned Movement, we found, was larger, stronger \r\nand even more relevant than ever before. Many of the old divisions in the \r\nMovement had closed, and a new cohesion had been found. Moreover, the \r\nMovement had turned more of its attention to problems of trade, finance, \r\ntechnology and all those other things that make up economic relations between \r\nnations. \r\nThe end of the cold war may have greatly diminished the likelihood of \r\nworldwide conflict and global cataclysm, but it has given rise to new \r\nchallenges that are just as threatening for the peoples of many nations and \r\nregions, even as many of the old issues remain unresolved. \r\nThe weight of their external debt continues to crush the economies of \r\nmany developing .countries, including those countries, like the Philippines, \r\nwhich have made strenuous efforts to pay their debts religiously. Surely, \r\nwith some imagination and creativity, and a modicum of good will and \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n32 \r\n(Mr. Romulo. Philippines) \r\nenlightened self-interest, the nations of the world can, together, arrive at \r\nsome solution that would allow the debtor countries to develop and get out \r\nfrom under the crushing burden of their debt. At the very least, the debtor \r\ncountries should be given access to their actual and potential markets without \r\nany artificial restrictions, to allow them to develop their economies and \r\nimprove the lives of their peoples while they continue to service their debts \r\nfrom meagre resources. \r\nMore and more of the world\u0027s nations have adhered ever more strongly to \r\nthe proposition that economic liberalization is vital to the improvement of \r\nindustrial productivity and the generation of economic growth. And yet, most \r\nironically, protectionist barriers continue to rise and to hamper the flow of \r\ngoods and services. The world\u0027s peoples call upon the international \r\ncommunity, in particular upon the developed countries, to lay aside narrow \r\nself-interest and push forward the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade \r\nnegotiations to a speedy and successful conclusion. \r\nThe formation of trading blocs in some areas has aroused the apprehension \r\nof countries outside those blocs with respect to their potential for \r\nartificially diverting trade and investment, diversions damaging to the \r\nefficiency of the global economic system. We in the Association of South-East \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) have committed ourselves to the formation of an ASEAN \r\nfree trade area that would facilitate trade among ourselves. But we are \r\ndetermined to keep ourselves open to world trade, on which our economies \r\ndepend so much. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n33 \r\n(Mr. Romulo. Philippines) \r\nEach country has an inalienable right to development. And the United \r\nNations has a paramount role in seeing to it that it is realized. The ongoing \r\nrestructuring and revitalization process in the economic and social fields \r\nshould therefore be geared towards the effective discharge of this role by the \r\nUnited Nations system. \r\nThe continuing scourge of poverty, the rapid increase in population, the \r\nuneven rate of economic growth among countries and the asymmetry in the \r\neconomic and social structures of nations, together with the dazzling advances \r\nin transportation and communication, have given rise to a new phenomenon of \r\nour times: the massive migration of labour. As one of the largest sources of \r\nthis migration, the Philippines is convinced that it is now time for the \r\ninternational community to deal with this phenomenon no longer in haphazard \r\nand isolated ways, but on a planned and strategic basis and on an \r\ninternational scale. \r\nIn so doing, we would do well to heed the appeal of the Secretary-General \r\nto accord deeper understanding and respect to the rights and needs of the more \r\nvulnerable groups of society. A substantial part of the migration of labour \r\nis the thousands of young women from many developing countries who venture \r\nforth to more affluent countries in search of a better life for themselves and \r\ntheir families, only to fall victim to unspeakable abuse, in many cases to \r\nviolence, sometimes ending in death, simply because they are women. Roaming \r\nthe streets of the world are 145 million children homeless, hungry, \r\nneglected, in mpst cases victims of abuse and mistreatment by adults. \r\nThousands of the disabled and the ageing, particularly in the developing \r\ncountries, are cast away, stripped of their dignity, from the mainstream of \r\nsociety. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n34 \r\n(Mr. Romulo. Philippines) \r\nThe untrammelled population growth in many regions, the profligate use of \r\nthe Earth\u0027s resources and the pollution of the land, water and air have \r\nseverely damaged the Earth\u0027s life-sustaining ecology in many places, \r\nthreatening the livelihoods of farmers and fishermen and the health of \r\neveryone. It was therefore with a keen sense of hope and high expectations \r\nthat the Philippines participated in the United Nations Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development in Rio de Janeiro last June. At that Conference, \r\nthe collective will of the international community was marshalled at the \r\nhighest level of leadership on behalf of the sustainable development of our \r\nEarth and its resources. The Philippines applauds its considerable \r\nachievements and remains committed to its goals and ideals, as embodied in \r\nAgenda 21, the implementation of which requires adequate new and additional \r\nfinancial resources. \r\nTo carry out on a national scale the objectives set forth in Agenda 21, \r\nmy President has created the Philippine Council for Sustainable Development, \r\nwhich counts non-governmental organizations and, particularly, the youth among \r\nits members. I am also pleased to announce that, in observance of the \r\nInternational Year for the World\u0027s Indigenous People, the Philippines will \r\nhost in April next year a Global Youth Earth Summit or Global YES in \r\ncooperation with the United Nations Environment Programme\u0027s Global Youth Forum \r\nand with the full endorsement and support of the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\nOrganization, and the International Labour Organisation. I appeal to the \r\nworld to support this undertaking. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n35 \r\n(Mr. Romulo. Philippinas) \r\nThe cold war\u0027s end has lifted a great pall of global threat from over the \r\nEarth and closed a fundamental division in the international community. It \r\nhas thus opened new vistas of hope for peace and global security, directly \r\nleading to major advances in some of the world\u0027s hitherto intractable \r\nconflicts: Afghanistan, Cambodia, the Middle East, Central America, South \r\nAfrica. Nevertheless, intra-regional and intra-national conflicts continue to \r\nravage people\u0027s lives and homes. \r\nThe end of super-Power confrontation and the dissolution of empires and \r\nblocs have freed nations and dismantled tyrannies. They have also unleashed \r\nage-old hostilities between antagonistic groups and released them to erupt in \r\ntragic violence. These conflicts, new and old, have taken various forms and \r\ndimensions. \r\nIn the Middle East, movement in the peace process has given rise to new, \r\nalbeit modest, hopes. However, hope must be tempered still, as the basic \r\ncause of conflict the denial of a homeland and sovereignty to the \r\nPalestinian people remains unresolved. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n36 \r\n(Mr. Romulo. Philippines) \r\nIn South Africa, the institutions of apartheid have been dismantled, a \r\nhopeful development that can be attributed in no small measure to the resolute \r\nand patient efforts of the United Nations and the international community. We \r\nare heartened that the stalled negotiations on the future of that country may \r\nfinally get back on track with the expected resumption of the Convention for a \r\nDemocratic South Africa. In Somalia, intertribal warfare conspires with the \r\ncruelties of nature to inflict upon the people of that unhappy land death by \r\nviolence or starvation. The people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, specifically \r\nits Muslim population, are subjected to the barbarity of ethnic cleansing and \r\nthe horrors of fratricidal war while the international community helplessly \r\nlooks on. Similar forms, if not similar degrees, of ethnic violence have \r\nerupted in some places in the former Soviet Union. \r\nIn our own region of South-East Asia, in Cambodia, a peace agreement \r\npainstakingly worked out by the United Nations, the Association of South-East \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN), other interested Governments and the Cambodian \r\nfactions themselves has provided for and led to the mounting of the largest \r\npeace-keeping operation of the United Nations and the assumption of one of its \r\ngravest responsibilities, the United Nations Transitional Authority for \r\nCambodia, to which the Philippines has contributed a contingent of policemen \r\nand naval observers. However, one of the factions has, of late, chosen not to \r\nparticipate further in the peace process until its conditions, some of which \r\ngo beyond the terms of the Paris peace Agreement, are met. It is now the \r\nresponsibility of the international community to ensure that the fabric of \r\nimminent peace does not unravel and to place the peace process back on track. \r\nConflicting claims in the South China Sea have given rise to acute \r\nconcern among the countries involved and other States with interests in the \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Romulo. Philippines) \r\narea. Last July the Foreign Ministers of ASEAN issued in Manila the ASEAN \r\nDeclaration on the South China Sea, calling on all claimants to settle their \r\ndisputes peacefully, pledging to embark on cooperative endeavours in the area \r\nand inviting all parties concerned to subscribe to the Declaration. Dialogues \r\nhave been taking place in the region involving officials and academicians from \r\nthe claimant States and other interested parties. It is our hope that these \r\ndialogues will help to avert misunderstanding and conflict and eventually lead \r\nto the day when this vast, vital and strategic portion of the sea can be \r\ntransformed from an area of incipient tension into a region of enduring peace \r\nand cooperation. All these fall squarely under the purposes and principles of \r\nthe Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation in South-East Asia, which the \r\nsignatories, including the Philippines, are requesting the General Assembly to \r\nendorse at this session. \r\nThus, even as the world welcomes the cold war\u0027s end and the march of \r\nfreedom and democracy across the earth, in the relations among nations old \r\nwounds fester, break out and recur and new ones are opened. And yet hopes run \r\nhigher than they have ever done since the last great war. These hopes are \r\nfocused especially on the new possibilities for the United Nations in its \r\nmission of preventing war, making peace, keeping the peace and building for \r\npeace. In this new era of opportunity it is both possible and imperative for \r\nthe United Nations to discharge the role envisioned for it by the Charter as \r\nthe primary keeper of peace and security in the world. \r\nIt is therefore extremely fitting that in his first report on the work of \r\nthe Organization our new Secretary-General dwells almost exclusively on this \r\nrole of the United Nations and the opportunities opened for it by the historic \r\nchanges of recent times. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n38 \r\n(Mr. Romulo. Philippines) \r\nThe Philippines welcomes the Secretary-General\u0027s report, \"An Agenda for \r\nPeace Preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping,\" and is studying \r\nit with great attention. We commend it to the world for serious \r\nconsideration, for it seeks to bring the United Nations back to its roots as \r\nan organization with an effective capacity to make peace and keep the peace. \r\nThe report is filled with wise, timely and practical prescriptions, and I \r\nshould like to single out a few. \r\nWe support the Secretary-General\u0027s call for an enlarged and more \r\neffective role for the International Court of Justice. We join the \r\nSecretary-General in reaffirming the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful \r\nSettlement of International Disputes, as approved by the General Assembly. We \r\nendorse his recognition of the need to relieve the economic difficulties of \r\nStates that are affected by sanctions imposed on another State under \r\nArticle 41 of the Charter. \r\nWe commend for especially close consideration the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\nbold proposals for giving life to Chapter Vll of the Charter, particularly \r\nArticle 42, which authorizes the Security Council to take military action to \r\nmaintain or restore international peace and security, and Article 43, which \r\nmandates Members of the United Nations to place armed forces and facilities on \r\ncall for this purpose. \r\nGranting the United Nations increased power and greater authority for \r\npeace-keeping and enforcement action would gain stronger support from the \r\ninternational community if the Security Council could function with a greater \r\ndegree of democracy than heretofore. Why, for example, should a region with \r\napproximately 15 per cent of the world\u0027s population and 23 per cent of the \r\ntotal membership of the United Nations have 40 per cent representation in the \r\nSecurity Council this year, with three having the power of veto? \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n39 \r\n(Mr. Romulo. Philippines) \r\nClearly, that is a legitimate guestion. However, the composition of the \r\nSecurity Council is but one of the provisions in the Charter that could stand \r\nimprovement. My delegation appreciates current efforts to restructure and \r\nrevitalize the economic and social sectors of the United Nations and to reform \r\nboth the General Assembly and the Secretariat. We note, however, that such \r\nefforts are often limited by a hesitation to review the United Nations Charter \r\nitself. \r\nAddressing the work of the Special Committee on the Charter and the \r\nStrengthening of the Role of the Organization during the twenty-ninth session \r\nof the General Assembly, the then Philippine Foreign Minister, \r\nGeneral Carlos P. Romulo, said: \r\n\"At no time in history has it been more clear that the many and \r\nclosely interrelated global problems that beset us will not yield to \r\npeacemeal and national solutions. The paramount importance of the United \r\nNations as the capstone of human society has been reaffirmed with great \r\nforce by the momentous events even of this single year. The design of a \r\nnew world economic order, the mobilizing of world agriculture, a global \r\napproach to population problems, the equitable redistribution of world \r\neconomic resources, the achievement of disarmament and peace all \r\nrequire an ever more effective and more efficient world Organization. \r\n\"For these reasons, it is more than ever appropriate that we are \r\ncontinuing our consideration of the improvement of the United Nations \r\nitself. The centrality of the United Nations is obvious and \r\ninescapable. The increasing value of the United Nations is undoubted. \r\nBut its rate of adaptation to rapidly moving world affairs is doubted; \r\nits adequacy to perform the functions thrust upon it by its Members, and \r\nsimply by the urgent course of world history, is doubted. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n40 \r\n(Mr. Romulo. Philippines) \r\n\"When we began this discussion in 1970, on the twenty-fifth \r\nanniversary of our world Organization, the effort seemed pertinent \r\nenough. But now, as we continue, the accelerating pace of change in the \r\nworld has already caught up with us and threatens to pass us by. The \r\nmechanisms of the United Nations are increasingly creaky and primitive in \r\nlight of the task of plenary management that the Organization is \r\nincreasingly called upon to assume. While the prescience of the founders \r\nwas remarkable, and they succeeded in designing a flexible and adaptable \r\nOrganization with a Charter of enduring worth, at the same time it was \r\nwholly impossible for them to anticipate the speed with which events \r\nwould carry us into the interdependent global age and the requirements \r\nthat would be placed on our world body.\" \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n41 \r\n(Mr. Romulo. Philippines) \r\nGeneral Romulo, who happened to be my father and one of the founders of \r\nthe United Nations, made these remarks in 1974. He might as well be making \r\nthem today. I do not wish to state the obvious, but I know that my father\u0027s \r\nmessage rings loud and clear in this Hall. Let us now proceed to rectify the \r\nomissions of the past. \r\nTowards this end, the Philippine delegation submits that the time has \r\ncome for the United Nations to avail itself of the provisions of Article 109 \r\nregarding the convening of a General Conference to review the Charter. My \r\ndelegation will consult with like-minded Members in the coming year with a \r\nview to definitively addressing this proposal, specifically through a \r\nresolution calling for such a review conference, which, according to the \r\nCharter itself, should have been placed on the agenda of the General Assembly \r\n10 years after its adoption in 1945. \r\nWe are only three years shy of the fiftieth anniversary of our \r\nOrganization. Its celebration, we believe, would be further enhanced by the \r\nadoption and implementation of such a resolution. Through it, we hope to \r\ncontribute to the noble work of making the United Nations a truly effective \r\ninstrument, as the signatories envisioned it to be, for saving \"succeeding \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war\" and for promoting \"social progress and \r\nbetter standards of life in larger freedom\". The confluence of historic \r\nevents in our time presents us with a unique opportunity to fulfil the mandate \r\nfrom our founders. Let us prove ourselves worthy of their trust. \r\nMr. NDOLO AYAH (Kenya): First of all, let me join the other \r\nrepresentatives who have spoken before me in congratulating you warmly. Sir, \r\non your unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of \r\nthe United Nations General Assembly. Your election to this high office is not \r\nonly proof of the confidence which the Assembly has in you, but a great honour \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Ndolo Avah. Kenya) \r\nas well to your country, Bulgaria. We are confident that, under your able \r\nleadership, our deliberations will be steered to a successful conclusion. \r\nI also wish to pay a tribute to your predecessor. Ambassador Samir \r\nShihabi of Saudi Arabia, for the great diplomatic skills with which he \r\nsuccessfully led the forty-sixth session. \r\nWe are happy to welcome the several Members that joined our Organization \r\nin the past year. With their admission, the United Nations has moved once \r\nagain closer to the realization of the principle of universality of \r\nmembership. We are encouraged by their commitment to the principles and \r\nobjectives of the Charter and we look forward to working closely with them in \r\nthe days ahead in creating a better world for mankind through this \r\nOrganization. Their admission comes at a very significant moment in the \r\nhistory of the United Nations, a time when our Organization is undergoing \r\nrevitalization and reorganization and is poised to meet the new challenges in \r\nthe rapidly changing international scene.* \r\nThe successes of the United Nations and the important contribution that \r\nit is expected to make towards the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity will in no small measure depend on the efforts of our new \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. We commend him for his timely \r\nreport, \"An Agenda for Peace\", in which he analyses and offers pragmatic \r\nrecommendations on ways of strengthening and making more efficient the \r\ncapacity of the United Nations for preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and \r\npeace-keeping. \r\nSecurity based on the old theory of deterrence has failed to guarantee \r\nmankind a world without the threat of war and nuclear holocaust. Kenya \r\n* Mr. Phoofolo (Lesotho), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n43 \r\n(Mr. Ndolo Ayah. Kenya) \r\nbelieves that peace is not merely the absence of war but the absence of the \r\nthreat of war or of the use of force in international relations and in all \r\nspheres of life as well. The end of super-Power rivalry and the demise of the \r\ncold-war era offer the world a rare opportunity not only to reorganize \r\ninternational relations but also to create a peaceful atmosphere devoid of \r\nnuclear threat. Positive steps have been taken in Geneva in the Conference on \r\nDisarmament through the successful conclusion of the negotiations on the \r\nchemical weapons Convention. Kenya is happy to be among the many States which \r\nhave sponsored a draft resolution, to be placed before this Assembly at the \r\ncurrent session, on chemical and bacteriological weapons under the Convention \r\non the prohibition of the development, production, stockpiling and use of \r\nchemical weapons. \r\nAs important as all these developments are, Kenya still holds to the view \r\nthat a comprehensive test ban is the only viable way of stopping the momentum \r\nof the nuclear arms race. It is the most appropriate tool for practical arms \r\ncontrol policies geared towards preventing further arms escalation. In this \r\nregard, the accession by China and France to the non-proliferation Treaty is a \r\nwelcome step in the right direction. \r\nKenya welcomed without reservation the collapse of the bipolar structure \r\nof the cold war. However, the consequences of the change have been \r\ndevastating to some and catastrophic to others. One thing is clear. The \r\nchanges, although desired and necessary, have come in too rapidly for most. \r\nConsequently, instead of being a triumph for democracy, the changes now \r\npresent a serious challenge, not only for democracy and the survival of the \r\ndemocratic institutions they were meant to strengthen, but also a severe test \r\nof the will and the capacity of the United Nations and its institutions to \r\nrespond effectively to the resultant crises. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n44-45 \r\n(Mr. Ndolo Ayah. Kenya) \r\nSomalia is a particularly distressing example. In the words of our \r\nSecretary-General, as contained in his report of 11 September 1992 on the work \r\nof this Organization: \r\n\"Somalia poses a particularly difficult challenge to the United \r\nNations. A means must be found of responding to the urgent and \r\noverwhelming needs of a population increasingly desperate in the face of \r\nwidespread hunger, the absence of national administration, almost \r\ncomplete destruction of basic infrastructure and acute insecurity.\" \r\n(A/47/1, para. 145) \r\nAs a neighbour to Somalia, Kenya has had to bear more than its fair share \r\nof Somali refugees, now standing at well over half a million people. Close to \r\n6 million out of Somali\u0027s population of 7 million people are in serious \r\ndistress, with some 2 million condemned to certain death before this human \r\ntragedy is eventually brought to a conclusion. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n46 \r\n(Mr. Ndolo Avah. Kenya) \r\nWe thank the Secretary-General and his team for their tireless efforts in \r\nputting together a comprehensive and multifaceted programme of action covering \r\nhumanitarian relief, the consolidation of a cease-fire, the reduction of \r\norganized violence and national reconciliation. The United Nations \r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Ambassador Jan Eliasson, has \r\nalso done commendably well in coordinating United Nations assistance to \r\nSomalia. Kenya still remains ready to offer the necessary facilities to \r\nUnited Nations agencies, and inter-governmental and non-governmental \r\norganizations to assist Somalia. \r\nWhile humanitarian assistance is of the utmost priority in the present \r\ncircumstances, we in Kenya have not lost sight of the paramount importance of \r\nthe need for a round table. There is absolutely no alternative to dialogue. \r\nMy President, His Excellency Daniel Arap Moi, has constantly reminded the \r\nSomali leaders that they must put the interests of the Somali people before \r\ntheir own narrow and personal interests. Kenya will do whatever it can, along \r\nwith its neighbours, to assist all Somali factions, without exclusion, to come \r\ntogether and discuss a durable solution to this tragedy. \r\nElsewhere in Africa there have been encouraging trends of reconciliation \r\nand amicable solutions to ethnic or ideological conflicts, which have retarded \r\nprogress for decades. We salute the people of Mozambique and Angola for \r\nopting for dialogue to solve their differences. \r\nWe also look forward to a peaceful solution, at long last, to the \r\nproblems of Cambodia and divided Korea, and support the initiatives in Central \r\nAmerica to solve their problems through the regional approach, as provided for \r\nin the Charter. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Ndolo Ayah. Kenya) \r\nThe situation in the Middle East is still far from settled. However we \r\nexpress cautious optimism at the current rounds of talks initiated by \r\nSecretary of State James Baker, involving the most important protagonists in \r\nthe Middle East conflict, the Palestinians. \r\nThe developments in South Africa are also of great encouragement to us. \r\nWe look forward to the resumption of the Convention for a Democratic South \r\nAfrica (CODESA) talks in order to accelerate movement towards genuine \r\ndemocracy in that country. \r\nThis session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time of \r\nincreased globalization of the world economy with promising opportunities for \r\nall countries, rich and poor. Unfortunately the benefits accruing from this \r\nglobalization are not being uniformly distributed. The economies of the \r\ndeveloping countries are characterized by a mounting debt burden, negative \r\nbalance-of-payments positions, declining investments, reduced external \r\ncreditworthiness, and a general backsliding in economic development. \r\nThe flow of international development finance to developing countries, \r\nboth official and commercial, has continued to decline at a time when more is \r\nneeded. This has resulted in the net outflow of resources from the developing \r\nto the developed countries. In order to reverse this negative trend, the \r\ndeveloped countries and the international financial institutions need to \r\nintensify their efforts to increase substantially the rate of financial flows \r\nto the developing countries on a continuous and assured basis. \r\nDonor countries which have not done so should make every effort to reach \r\nthe target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product in official \r\ndevelopment assistance to the developing countries as set out in the United \r\nNations International Development Strategy. Aid conditionalities and \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n48 \r\n(Mr. Ndolo Avah. Kenya) \r\ncross-conditionalities imposed on the developing countries by a number of \r\ndonors should be lifted. They are unrealistically stringent and \r\ncounter-productive. There is, therefore, urgent need for donors to re-examine \r\ntheir policies in international cooperation in order to avoid actions that \r\nhurt the already debt-ridden economies of the recipient countries. \r\nThe external debt crisis of the developing countries is being exacerbated \r\nby volatile exchange rates and currency fluctuations, the collapse of \r\ncommodity prices, a general deterioration in the terms of trade of the debtor \r\ncountries and the domestic financial and economic policies of the creditor \r\ncountries. In an effort to lower inflation the creditor countries have \r\nadopted measures which have reduced opportunities for the exports of the \r\ndeveloping countries and led to higher interest rates, further jeopardizing \r\nthe ability of the debtor countries to meet their debt obligations. \r\nKenya feels that any meaningful solution to the debt crisis must address \r\nthe real causes of the problem with a view to obtaining a durable solution. \r\nWe welcome the efforts taken by some members of the donor community to reduce \r\nor cancel the debts owed by the developing countries. An effective and \r\nlasting solution to the debt problem of developing countries can be achieved \r\nonly through measures directed towards the revitalization of the economic \r\ngrowth and development of the developing countries. \r\nTrade protectionism and the failure by the developed countries totally to \r\nobserve international trade practices have also contributed to reduced market \r\nopportunities for the exports of the developing countries. Protectionism, \r\nalong with subsidies, has adversely affected the ability of the developing \r\ncountries, particularly those in Africa, to earn badly needed foreign exchange \r\nand has resulted in developing countries losing some $500 billion a year. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n49 \r\n(Mr. Ndolo Ayah. Kenya) \r\nThat is 10 times more than the amount of foreign assistance granted to these \r\ncountries. The situation is worsened by the steeply declining prices of \r\ncommodities on which many developing countries are highly dependent. Since \r\nthe collapse of the International Coffee Agreement in 1989, for example, \r\ncoffee-producing countries have lost more than $10 billion. \r\nIn order to reverse this unfavourable trend, the developed countries \r\nshould dismantle protectionism in world trade and ensure that inward-looking \r\nregionalism and economic blocs do not undermine the multilateral trading \r\nsystem. There is urgent need for an early and successful conclusion of the \r\nUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) \r\nmultilateral trade negotiations. \r\nThe liberalization programmes supported by the donor community, \r\nespecially the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, should \r\nbalance between promoting a market for the industrialized countries and making \r\nthe exports of developing countries more competitive in the world market. \r\nThese programmes should also support processing in the developing countries to \r\ngive their products a higher added value in order to fetch more in \r\ninternational markets. \r\nSome developing countries, including Kenya, with the support of the IMF \r\nand the World Bank, are implementing structural adjustment programmes. While \r\nour countries accept the objectives of these structural adjustments, the rates \r\nand sometimes the methods of implementation advocated by the donor community, \r\nparticularly the IMF and the World Bank, are out of step with our political, \r\neconomic or social capacity to absorb them. Kenya is convinced that the \r\nsustainability of these programmes cannot be guaranteed unless they are \r\ncompatible with political and social situations in the recipient countries. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n50 \r\n(Mr. Ndolo Avah. Kenya) \r\nKenya believes that peace, security and stability cannot be assured in \r\nthe face of the abject poverty in which millions of people in developing \r\ncountries live. We fully endorse the position of developing countries members \r\nof the Group of 77 that the eradication of poverty constitutes a major \r\nchallenge at the present time. That must be the goal in the revitalization of \r\ngrowth and in sustainable development in developing countries. We equally \r\nsupport and endorse the recommendation of the Economic and Social Council at \r\nits 1992 substantive session that the General Assembly should convene a world \r\nsummit for social development in 1995. Such a conference would contribute to \r\nthe important objective of putting people at the centre of development and \r\ninternational cooperation. Eradication of poverty is a national objective in \r\nKenya and every effort is being made towards that end. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. Ndolo Avah. Kenya) \r\nKenya, like many other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, has had its share \r\nof drought and of the shortage of food, which have been compounded by the \r\nrefugee problem. The persistent critical economic and social problems in \r\nAfrica, coupled with the debt-burden, declining prices of commodities, \r\nvagaries of climate and weather conditions, environmental degradation, \r\npopulation increase, and social as well as political effects of structural \r\nadjustment, have all added to the deterioration of living standards and have \r\nfrustrated efforts for economic recovery. Almost 40 million people in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa are currently faced with the threat of starvation. \r\nThe Government of Kenya is most appreciative of the response of the \r\ninternational community and of the bilateral assistance from friendly \r\ncountries, in the face of the severe drought and crop failure that gripped our \r\ncountry. The United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs launched a \r\nSpecial Appeal for Kenya, alongside the Special Emergency Programme for the \r\nHorn of Africa. I wish to convey the thanks and gratitude of my country to \r\nthe Secretary-General for this timely action and particularly for releasing to \r\nthe United Nations Children\u0027s Fund $2 million from the Central Emergency \r\nRevolving Fund for the provision of water, emergency drugs, vaccines and \r\nshelter in the north and north-eastern areas of Kenya. We should like to make \r\na further appeal for continued assistance in view of the overwhelming flood of \r\nrefugees and the effect of the drought in Kenya. \r\nThe holding of the United Nations Conference on Environment and \r\nDevelopment in Rio this year was a clear indication of the concern of humanity \r\nfor the state of the global environment. It Emphasized the fact that the \r\ncontinuing deterioration of the environment is a serious threat to the \r\nsurvival of the human race and the planet Earth. The agreements reached in \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. Ndolo Avah. Kenya) \r\nRio represent a remarkable achievement by any standard despite the fact that \r\nthey did not meet all our hopes and expectations in all areas. None the less, \r\nwhat is gratifying is that the results of the Rio Earth Summit, contained in \r\nthe Rio Declaration and in Agenda 21, provide the basis for a new global \r\npartnership, embracing the rich and the poor. North and South, East and West. \r\nNoteworthy is the fact that, for the first time, the world community gave \r\nits united attention to the process of desertification, one of the problems \r\nfacing the African continent and indeed Kenya. This process has given rise to \r\nuntold levels of poverty and it is time we had an international legal \r\ninstrument that would focus on this scourge. It is therefore pleasing to note \r\nthat the Rio Conference called attention to the need to start work on an \r\ninternational convention on desertification, with special reference to Africa. \r\nIn spite of what was accomplished at Rio, we cannot afford to be \r\ncomplacent. Much more needs to be done. The road from Rio will be longer and \r\nperhaps more challenging than the road to Rio. Programmes need to be \r\nimplemented and treaties put into force and strengthened. \r\nWhile Kenya is ready to pursue the objectives of sustainable development, \r\nwe have to emphasize that a positive move on the part of developed countries \r\nis needed in the implementation of provisions regarding new and additional \r\nresources and technical assistance, as well the transfer of environmentally \r\nsound technologies, to enable developing countries to play their role. \r\nIndeed, at Rio, the developed countries reaffirmed their commitment to reach \r\nthe accepted target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official \r\ndevelopment aid to augment their aid programmes. While this commitment is \r\ncommendable, Kenya\u0027s view is that specific commitments should be spelt out, \r\nsince the success and implementation of Agenda 21 will depend very heavily on \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Ndolo Ayah, Kenya) \r\nthe availability of finance. We also wish to underscore that the \r\nimplementation of sustainable development will be futile if developed \r\ncountries and financial institutions use financial considerations as an excuse \r\nfor interfering in the internal affairs of developing countries or as an \r\nopportunity to introduce conditionalities. \r\nThe establishment of the Commission for Sustainable Development is \r\nimportant since it will provide a focal point of intergovernmental \r\ndecision-making to effect the integration of the environmental and \r\ndevelopmental strategies contained in Agenda 21. Kenya believes that the only \r\nway for the new Commission to be most effective in implementing Agenda 21 \r\nwould be for the General Assembly to resist any organizational modalities and \r\nmandates that would create unnecessarily costly and large bureaucratic \r\nmachinery. The Commission should operate as a functional commission of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council within recognized rules of procedure and should be \r\nelaborated in the context of the ongoing revitalization and rationalization of \r\nthe Council. The policy responsibilities of the Commission must be well \r\ndefined to avoid conflicts with other bodies. It should be both future- and \r\ndevelopment-oriented, providing a forum for the review, further development \r\nand updating of Agenda 21 in the light of future economic, financial, \r\ntechnological, legal and other developments. \r\nAt its forty-sixth session, the General Assembly adopted resolution \r\n46/164, accepting the idea of convening a United Nations conference on human \r\nsettlements, possibly in 1997, and requested the Secretary-General to submit a \r\nreport on the item. My delegation fully supports this decision, which would \r\noffer a unique opportunity to evaluate and strengthen the progress of Habitat, \r\ntaking into account the fact that urbanization is one of the fundamental \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n54-55 \r\n(Mr. Ndolo Ayah. Kenya) \r\nenvironmental problems that we cannot afford to overlook. \r\nBefore concluding, let me comment briefly on the Decade of International \r\nLaw. At its forty-fifth session, the General Assembly declared the 1990s to \r\nbe the United Nations Decade of International Law. Respect and adherence by \r\nall States to the principles and norms of international law would lead us to a \r\nmore orderly world in which disputes that may arise can be resolved by \r\npeaceful means. All of us must, therefore, exert every effort to ensure that \r\nthe aims of the Decade are promoted and that meaningful programmes are adopted \r\nso that the Decade may become a reality. \r\nIt would also be very opportune if, in this Decade of International Law, \r\nthe world were to witness not only the coming into force of the Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea, but also its universal acceptance as the comprehensive \r\nlegal order for the world seas. We therefore applaud the Secretary-General in \r\nthese efforts aimed at making this a reality and we wish him well and \r\nsuccess. We must, however, be very careful that universal acceptance of the \r\nConvention will not mean unravelling its core principle, which is that the \r\nhigh seas and the resources therein are and shall be exploited for the common \r\nheritage of all mankind. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n56 \r\nMr. AITMATOV (Kyrgyzstan) (interpretation from Russian): Allow me \r\nto express my sincere congratulations to the President of the current General \r\nAssembly on his election. I should also like to wish every success to the \r\nSecretary-General in his work. \r\nThis session of the General Assembly is the first one for Kyrgyzstan, as \r\nit is for other new United Nations Member States, and provides us with a \r\nunique opportunity to introduce ourselves us to the world community and to \r\nexpress our vision of future cooperation with the organization. \r\nKyrgyzstan emerged as an independent State at a turning point in world \r\nhistory. The collapse of totalitarianism and profound geopolitical changes in \r\nthe territory of the former Soviet Union enabled my Republic to seize this \r\nhistoric opportunity to establish itself as an independent State. Less than a \r\nmonth ago, we celebrated the first anniversary of our independence. \r\nFrom the very outset, we saw no other alternative in using the right of \r\nindependent choice we obtained than the establishment of a pluralistic \r\ndemocracy as the only means of creating a decent life for the individual by \r\nensuring political, economic and spiritual freedoms. \r\nThe difficult process of creating a democratic legal State, strengthening \r\ninter-ethnic harmony and social accord and building the basis for a market \r\neconomy is under way in Kyrgyzstan. Our criteria are the highest \r\ninternational standards for ensuring human rights and freedoms, and we are \r\npursuing their implementation in all areas of political and legislative \r\nactivity. These standards are set forth in the draft of our new Constitution, \r\nwhich our Parliament is soon to discuss. In the near future, Kyrgyzstan will \r\nalso adhere to major international agreements on human rights. \r\nWe appreciate the friendly view taken abroad of the democratic changes \r\nunder way in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Aitmatov. Kyrgyzstan) \r\nKyrgyzstan today is recognized by 107 countries the world over, and \r\ndiplomatic relations have been established with more than 50 of them. It has \r\nbecome a member of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope (CSCE), the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other \r\ninternational and regional institutions. \r\nKyrgyzstan is open to sound, mutually beneficial relations and ready for \r\npartnership with those countries which share our ideals of freedom and \r\ndemocracy. \r\nWe attach great importance to maintaining cooperation within the \r\nCommonwealth of Independent States. The meeting of Heads of State of the \r\nCommonwealth, which took place in Bishkek recently, might help strengthen \r\nintegration, but we recognize the different situations involved and the \r\nvarious approaches taken to this integration. \r\nOn the international scene, Kyrgyzstan will act as peace-loving, neutral, \r\nnon-nuclear State. As such, our Republic is ready to sign the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to tackle other issues related to the \r\nstrengthening of strategic and military security. \r\nOur meeting takes place at a crucial turning point for the United \r\nNations. The process of searching for the most adequate and appropriate \r\nprinciples for the Organization, in keeping with the new, changing realities \r\nof a post-confrontation world, is now under way. \r\nDistortions caused by totalitarianism in the sphere of interstate and \r\ninterethnic relations have led to emergence of crisis zones in the vast area \r\nstretching from the former Yugoslavia to Central Asia. \r\nWe support the ideas put forward in the report of the Secretary-General, \r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277), aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr. Aitmatov, Kyrgyzstan) \r\npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping. We believe that in order \r\nto prevent and settle conflicts, it is necessary to apply within the framework \r\nof international law all existing mechanisms of the United Nations and the \r\nCSCE. The main thing is the timeliness and adequacy of the steps undertaken. \r\nPreventive diplomacy and timely reaction should be given top priority in all \r\npeace-keeping efforts. \r\nWe are especially concerned over maintaining stability in Central Asia. \r\nKyrgyzstan advocates constructive steps and a regional orientation for \r\nmaintaining peace and stability in the region. \r\nIn this connection, we were greatly interested by a proposal for \r\norganizing a forum on interaction and confidence in Asia similar to the \r\nall-European process put forward yesterday by the President of Kazakhstan, \r\nNursultan Mazarbayev, in his speech to the General Assembly. \r\nThis forum, as we see it, could help to adapt to Asian realities the vast \r\nexperience accumulated by world and European organizations in \r\nconfidence-building measures and mechanisms for collective security. \r\nKyrgyzstan is now passing through a harsh economic crisis, the reasons \r\nfor which are evident and well-known. The situation has been aggravated by \r\nnatural disasters. On two occasions this year an earthquake and a flood have \r\nled to the loss of human lives and caused enormous material damage. \r\nObviously, it would be difficult for us to overcome all the problems of the \r\ntransitional period by ourselves. \r\nIt is therefore difficult to overestimate the importance of the economic, \r\nfinancial, technical and humanitarian assistance provided us by the world \r\ncommunity. The cooperation of the United Nations and its specialized agencies \r\n\"ith a large group of countries that became full-fledged members only recently \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n59-60 \r\n(Mr. Aitmatov. Kyrgyzstan) \r\nis especially valuable both from the standpoint of solving their problems and \r\nwith respect to reforms under way in the Organization. In general terms, this \r\nrelates to the effectiveness of the United Nations and of its system. \r\nWe appreciate the activities of the United Nations specialized agencies, \r\nwhich, through an adequate assessment of our status and situation, are active \r\nin setting up programmes in our country. The upcoming opening in Bishkek of a \r\nUnited Nations representative office will promote the speedy integration of \r\nKyrgyzstan into international economic, technical, scientific and humanitarian \r\ncooperation. \r\nOur Republic became a United Nations member at a time of renewal and \r\nreforms. We are in favour of practical steps aimed at enhancing the \r\neffectiveness of this Organization as the key factor in establishing a new \r\nworld order. \r\nI take this opportunity to confirm that Kyrgyzstan will adhere strictly \r\nto the provisions of the Charter and will make its contribution to the \r\nactivities of the Organization. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n61 \r\nMr. CARIAS ZAPATA (Honduras) (interpretation from Spanish): I wish \r\nto convey to Mr. Ganev the most sincere congratulations of the Government of \r\nHonduras on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its forty-seventh session. Through him we should also like to \r\nextend our best wishes to the Bulgarian people, who, like other peoples of \r\nEastern Europe, are today, after much effort and self-sacrifice, helping to \r\nkeep alive the flame of freedom, democracy and progress in that continent. \r\nTo the new Members of our Organization, we extend a most cordial \r\ngreeting. We are fully convinced that through the United Nations we shall be \r\nable to establish growing links of friendship and cooperation. \r\nOur Organization is grounded on principles of equality, shared \r\nresponsibilities, and the promotion of international peace and security. We \r\nhope that Serbia and Montenegro will best achieve those objectives by meeting \r\nthe legitimate expectations of the international community that an end will be \r\nput to the war, persecution and intolerance in the countries of former \r\nYugoslavia, and that they will be able to become Members of this great family \r\nof nations. \r\nMoreover, in a world of changing realities, one which is none the less \r\nmarked by its attachment to universality and peaceful coexistence, my \r\nGovernment, like other Central American countries, believes that we should \r\nopen the way for the Republic of China, with more than 20 million inhabitants \r\nand authorities established in Taipei, to participate in the work of our \r\nOrganization and its specialized agencies as that country does in various \r\nregional forums and international mechanisms. Membership in the United \r\nNations does not constitute diplomatic recognition of sovereignty, and there \r\nhave been and are precedents in the history of the United Nations for the \r\nsimultaneous presence of countries which are in search of their historical \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Carias Zapata. Honduras) \r\nunity but which, while they remain separated, have not been denied the \r\nopportunity to make their contribution to the complex fabric of international \r\nrelations and obligations which bring together the peoples of the Earth \r\nthrough the United Nations. \r\nWe are beginning a new era in the life of this Organization. For us, the \r\n\"Agenda for Peace\" of our distinguished Secretary-General is a noteworthy \r\neffort embodying both vision and realism that will enable us to make progress \r\nin forging a more secure and prosperous world. The Government of Honduras \r\nwarmly supports the proposals on preventive diplomacy and on strengthening the \r\nlogistical and financial capacity of the United Nations for peace-keeping and \r\nfor peace-building when peace is threatened, when peace has been breached, or \r\nwhen the persistence of situations of confrontation make peace vulnerable. \r\nIn accordance with those aims, Honduras also urges greater support for \r\nand use of the international organs for the legal settlement of disputes such \r\nas the International Court of Justice, which has only recently handed down a \r\njudgment providing a definitive solution to a long-standing border dispute \r\nbetween El Salvador and Honduras. The peoples and Governments of both \r\ncountries intend to comply in good faith with this judgement. \r\nHonduras has also decided to lend its armed forces and police for \r\npeace-keeping missions and is at present satisfactorily participating in the \r\nconciliation mission in Western Sahara of the United Nations Mission for the \r\nReferendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). \r\nWith the end of a bipolar world and of the cold war, the terrible threat \r\nof a nuclear holocaust has dissipated. However, atomic weapons and other \r\npowerful weapons of mass destruction continue to overfill the arsenals of \r\nlarge and medium-sized Powers. My country therefore urges those who possess \r\nnuclear weapons to pursue, and as appropriate to initiate, serious and \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. Carias Zapata. Honduras) \r\nverifiable programmes for the reduction and destruction of such weapons, and \r\nthe dismantling of possible vehicles for them. We also urge that the \r\nnon-proliferation Treaty system be made more general and strengthened, with \r\nguarantees of verification; this applies also to the regional systems such as \r\nthe Treaty of Tlatelolco. We shall also join in the broad movement that is \r\nbeing generated at this session towards seeking and achieving the prohibition \r\nof the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. \r\nIn the Persian Gulf, the reasons for the vigorous response by the \r\ninternational community in defence of the sovereignty and legitimate rights of \r\nKuwait still exist in several respects. More than ever before, the United \r\nNations should redouble its efforts to bring about faithful compliance with \r\nthe relevant resolutions of the Security Council ensuring an end to threats of \r\naggression and guaranteeing for the countries of the Gulf an environment of \r\npeace and a future free of coercion and uncertainty. \r\nIn the Middle East, in southern Africa and in Cambodia, processes of \r\npeace and reconciliation continue to move forward. Candidly acknowledging \r\npast injustices, trusting in the mediating efforts of the United Nations, and \r\nconvinced that the fruits of peace are beneficial to their populations, the \r\nleaders of all the parties involved in these conflicts should now more than \r\never before strive to bring about eguitable solutions to the differences that \r\nseparate them, in order to guarantee a speedy restoration in their respective \r\nregions of stable and secure conditions of good neighbourliness.* \r\nThe signing of the Chapultepec Peace Agreements in January this year \r\nbetween the Government of El Salvador and representatives from the insurgent \r\nThe President returned to the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n64-65 \r\n(Mr. Carias Zapata. Honduras) \r\nmovement has brought an end to armed confrontation in our neighbouring country \r\nand has opened the way for a complete reconciliation in the spirit of freedom \r\nand democracy for the Salvadorian people. Honduras associated itself in the \r\nwell-deserved tribute paid to former Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar \r\nfor his mediating efforts. We have given and shall continue to give our full \r\nsupport to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in the fulfilment of the \r\nvarious stages of the peace agreement, including demobilization of formerly \r\nopposed forces and integration into civil and political life of the insurgents \r\nin a framework of complete legality. \r\nWith peace in El Salvador, Central America, under the sign of democracy, \r\nis returning to the path of integration and development. Our countries are \r\naware of the countless challenges posed by the insufficiency of our productive \r\ninfrastructure, poverty and inequalities. But we also know that with \r\ndedication and vision, and especially with unity, we shall be able to overcome \r\nthem. \r\nThat is why the Tegucigalpa Protocol (A/46/829, annex III) of \r\n13 December 1991 has entered into force, establishing a system for Central \r\nAmerica integration which, working in the summit meetings of Presidents of the \r\nCentral American isthmus, will impart force and impetus to a broad movement \r\ntowards integration. Honduras hopes that the ever-stronger voice of Central \r\nAmerica will be heard and that our region, a region of peace, democracy, \r\nfreedom and development, will join and participate actively in the new forms \r\nof global interdependence that are taking shape on the eve of a new millenium. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n66 \r\n(Mr. Carias Zapata. Honduras) \r\nFor Honduras, an essential part of this integrated vision is the \r\nformation and implementation of national, regional and international \r\nstrategies to fight poverty and to overcome long-standing problems that strike \r\nhardest at children, women and the elderly. \r\nIf we justly aspire to economic development, and to growing expansion of \r\ntrade in goods and services originating from all continents, we should \r\nlikewise aspire to, and indeed make possible, real improvement in the quality \r\nof life of the inhabitants of our countries. Enhanced social well being \r\nshould not be conceived of as a generous remedy that may prove insufficient to \r\nthe communities receiving it, but rather as a joint undertaking to facilitate, \r\nthrough international cooperation, conditions for vocational training and \r\nbetter access to the opportunities that can be provided by open and growing \r\neconomies. \r\nOn 12 December 1991, in Central America, the Heads of State and \r\nGovernment of the seven countries of the isthmus assumed that very commitment, \r\nand, in the presence of various distinguished figures and executives of the \r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations, initiated a coordinated programme \r\nof human development with goals, objectives and resources defined for the \r\npresent decade to culminate in the year 2000. \r\nThose initiatives of our subregion are universal in conception. That is \r\nwhy Honduras, like Chile and other friendly countries, will continue to give \r\nimpetus to, and participate in, the appropriate preparations for and holding \r\nof a world conference on social and human development that may serve as a \r\nforum for reflection and initiatives to effectively set in motion \r\ninternational measures and policies in this respect. \r\nIn an ever more integrated world, our countries, which share not only a \r\nrich cultural heritage exemplified by the common use of a single language, but \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n67 \r\n(Mr. Carias Zapata. Honduras* \r\nalso a democratic and modern vision of international relations, are naturally \r\nseeking to strengthen our links of fraternal friendship and our presence in \r\nthe world. Those are the fundamental reasons that led us to constitute the \r\nIbero-American Conference, which, following its founding declaration in \r\nGuadalajara, signed in July 1991 by the Heads of State and Government of the \r\nHispanic-American countries, Brazil, Spain and Portugal, has now formally been \r\nconstituted. \r\nWithin the Ibero-American Conference, as a mechanism for interaction and \r\ncooperation, we have been designing programmes of mutual benefit primarily in \r\nthe fields of education, exchanges of programmes via satellite, the creation \r\nof an indigenous fund and the launching of a broad programme of exchanges of \r\nscholars and researchers. \r\nThe Summit of Heads of State and Government held in Madrid this year also \r\ngave support to growing and leading involvement by our countries in a world \r\nprogramme of human development. \r\nMaintenance of an open multilateral trading system is of vital importance \r\nto the expansion of world trade and the economic development of all \r\ncountries. For that reason we must join our efforts to bring about the speedy \r\nculmination, on satisfactory terms, of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade \r\nNegotiations. Stagnation of the negotiating process would have very serious \r\nconsequences for world trade and would affect prospects and the structural \r\nprogrammes that many developing countries have undertaken at the cost of great \r\nsacrifice to find our proper place in the trend towards large trading blocs. \r\nThis year there has been a dramatic fall in the prices of commodities \r\nessential to our economies. This leads us to stress the need to bring about \r\nbetter regulation of conditions of access guaranteeing the growth of sales of \r\nour competitive products at fair prices. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n68 \r\n(Mr. Carias Zapata. Honduras) \r\nIn this context we must also, in our judgement, strengthen the transfer \r\nof technology for industrial development and more flexible terms in financing \r\nthe modernization of industrial plant in developing countries. \r\nThe urgent need to share responsibilities and to act together to \r\nguarantee global economic stability independently of the economic and \r\npolitical power of each nation, together with the growing convergence of views \r\nas to global priorities, were clearly and positively demonstrated at the Earth \r\nSummit held in Rio de Janeiro. \r\nThe Government of Honduras takes great satisfaction from the common \r\nreflection on urgent environmental problems initiated at that conference, and \r\nwe reiterate our support for the principles adopted by it and for Agenda 21, \r\nwhich comprehensively encompasses a whole programme of action in the \r\nenvironmental sphere and for sustainable development. \r\nWe must persevere in this direction. The deterioration of nature must be \r\nhalted. Together we can design conservation strategies that allow for the \r\nrational use of natural resources to meet the needs of employment and the \r\neconomic growth of our populations.* \r\nThe new strategy of peace is also necessarily a new strategy of \r\ndevelopment. Only by growing together can we survive; only by pooling our \r\nefforts can we secure for future generations a better world in harmony and \r\nconcord. \r\nThe President returned to the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n69-70 \r\nAGENDA ITEM 8 (continued) \r\nADOPTION OF THE AGENDA AND ORGANIZATION OF WORK: SECOND REPORT OF THE GENERAL \r\nCOMMITTEE (A/47/250/Add.1) \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I now draw the attention of representatives to the \r\nsecond report of the General Committee (A/47/250/Add.l), concerning a request \r\nsubmitted by Pakistan for the inclusion in the agenda of an additional item as \r\nwell as a request submitted by the Secretary-General also for the inclusion in \r\nthe agenda of an additional item. \r\nIn paragraph 1 (a) of the report, the General Committee recommends the \r\ninclusion in the agenda of the current session of an additional item entitled \r\n\"Emergency assistance to Pakistan\". \r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to include in its agenda \r\nthe additional item entitled \"Emergency assistance to Pakistan\"? \r\nIt was so decided. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: In paragraph 1 (b) of the report, the General \r\nCommittee also recommends to the Assembly that this item should be considered \r\ndirectly in plenary meeting. \r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly adopts this recommendation? \r\nIt was so decided. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: May I also take it that the item should be \r\nconsidered with priority because of its urgent character? \r\nIt was so decided. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n71 \r\nThe PRESIDENT: In this connection, I should like to inform \r\nrepresentatives that this item will be considered on Wednesday, 7 October, in \r\nthe morning, after we heard the last speaker in the general debate for that \r\nmeeting. \r\nNext, I should like to draw the attention of representatives to \r\nparagraph 2 (a) of the report A/47/250/Add.l. \r\nThe General Committee recommends the inclusion in the agenda of the \r\ncurrent session of an additional item entitled \"Programme budget for the \r\nbiennium 1990-1991\". \r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to include in its agenda \r\nthe additional item entitled \"Programme budget for the biennium 1990-1991\". \r\nIt was so decided. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: In paragraph 2 (b) of the report, the General \r\nCommittee also recommends that the item be allocated to the Fifth Committee. \r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly adopts that recommendation of \r\nthe General Committee? \r\nIt was so decided. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Chairman of the Fifth Committee will be \r\ninformed of the decision just taken. \r\nI should now like to draw the General Assembly\u0027s attention to the fact \r\nthat, at its 3rd plenary meeting, the Assembly allocated item 105, \"Programme \r\nplanning\", to the Fifth Committee, on the understanding that each programme of \r\nthe proposed revisions to the medium-term plan should be submitted to plenary \r\nmeeting or to the appropriate Main Committee for review. \r\nHowever, programme 4 was not included in the list of programmes to be \r\nsubmitted to the Third Committee for review. \r\nA/47/PV.26 \r\n72 \r\n(The President) \r\nMay I therefore take it that it is the wish of the Assembly that \r\nprogramme 4 should also be submitted to the Third Committee for review? \r\nIf I hear no objection, it will be so decided. \r\nIt was so decided. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Chairman of the Third Committee will be \r\ninformed of the decision just taken. \r\nTENTATIVE PROGRAMME OF WORK \r\nThe PRESIDENT: Members will recall that yesterday morning I \r\noutlined for them the tentative programme of work for the remainder of October. \r\nI should now like to inform members that the Pledging Conference for \r\nDevelopment Activities will be held in the mornings of Tuesday, 3 November, \r\nand Wednesday, 4 November.
