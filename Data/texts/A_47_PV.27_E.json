President of the Republic of Botswana, was escort-pri \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic of Botswana, \r\nHis Excellency Sir Ketumile Masire, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\nPresident MASIRE: I am pleased to extend to you. Sir, and to your \r\ncountry, Bulgaria, the sincere congratulations of my delegation on your \r\nelection to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the United Nations \r\nGeneral Assembly. I have no doubt that under your able leadership this \r\nsession will be a great success. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n6 \r\n(President Masire) \r\nIn the short space of time since he assumed office at the beginning of \r\nthe year, our new Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has more than \r\njustified the confidence reposed in him and his prodigious qualities and \r\nabilities by his election to the highly demanding office of \r\nSecretary-General. He has been, during these nine turbulent months, more than \r\na match for the daunting c.ises that have so far characterized the so-called \r\nnew world order. We salute him and his equally dedicated colleagues in the \r\nSecretariat. \r\nThe forty-seventh session of the General Assembly is being held at a rare \r\nmoment in history. It is a moment so brilliantly captured in the language of \r\nArticle 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, wherein are written \r\nthese words: \r\n\"The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of \r\ngovernment; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine \r\nelections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage ...\". \r\n(resolution 217 A (III), article 21, para. 3) \r\nPeoples across the globe are marching triumphantly to seize control of \r\ntheir own destinies through the ballot. This has been clearly manifested in \r\nthe admission of seven new Members during the forty-sixth regular session of \r\nthe General Assembly and many more at its resumed meetings. The membership of \r\nthose new States enhances the universality of the United Nations. We warmly \r\nwelcome their presence in our midst. \r\nThe end of the cold war has triggered an avalanche of demands on the \r\nUnited Nations at a time w!-en the Organization is tottering on the verge of \r\nbankruptcy. The Organizat.on is being called upon to be everywhere where \r\nt\u0027-iere is a problem and to carry out activities ranging from peace-keeping and \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n7 \r\n(President Masire) \r\npeacemaking in areas ravaged by civil wars to fighting natural disasters. It \r\nis also required to play a role in areas where democracy is being embraced. \r\nThe financing of both the United Nations activities under its regular \r\nbudget and its peace-keeping operations has never been more crucial to the \r\nrole and function of the Organization. For many years the Organization was \r\nparalysed by ideological confrontation, and it is unfortunate that it should \r\nnow be hamstrung in the performance of its functions by financial emergency \r\nand crisis in an era when there is so much good will. \r\nThe issue is simple: the machinery of the United Nations cannot be \r\nexpected to function effectively and efficiently when it has run out of \r\nfinancial steam. We can all bear testimony to the success of the United \r\nNations system when there is a common desire and will to put the system to \r\nwork. The assessed contributions have to be paid in full and on time, in \r\naccordance with the Charter. All arrears have to be paid as a demonstration \r\nof our commitment to the process of renewal and revitalization currently going \r\non in the world and within the United Nations itself. \r\nBotswana has followed with grave concern the tragic events in Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, the senseless killing and brutality visited on innocent men, \r\nwomen and children. It is indeed unfortunate that while many States in \r\nEastern and Central Europe have experienced relatively peaceful transitions to \r\ndemocracy and political pluralism, the people of the former Yugoslavia, the \r\nfounding champion and leader of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, should \r\nbe bleeding so hopelessly. Yugoslavia was a critical factor for stability in \r\nCentral Europe during the lark days of super-Power rivalry and military \r\nconfrontation. \r\nHowever, we cannot be distracted from present reality by the past. The \r\ninternational community has been rightfully outraged by acts of barbarism in a \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n8-10 \r\n(President Masire) \r\nworld increasingly characterized by civilized conduct in inter-State \r\nrelations. The agreements reached at the London Conference, which enjoy the \r\noverwhelming approbation of the international community, must be implemented \r\nin full by all the parties involved in the brutal conflict. No effort should \r\nbe spared in ensuring the restoration of lasting peace in the Balkans. \r\nIn South-East Asia, the brave and courageous men and women of the United \r\nNations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) continue to work quietly \r\nand tirelessly to bring about peace and stability in that country. It is \r\nhoped that all parties to the Agreement on a Comprehensive Political \r\nSettlement of the Cambodia Conflict will honour their obligations. The people \r\nof Cambodia have long awaited the day when they can return to their homes, \r\nwalk in the streets and till the soil without fear of land mines. \r\nThe implementation of the peace agreement is a monumental task the likes \r\nof which this world body has never before undertaken. It is vitally important \r\nthat the efforts of the United Nations succeed in timely and effective \r\nfashion. A situation in which the United Nations Transitional Authority in \r\nCambodia (UNTAC) might be marooned in Cambodia, with the financial burden that \r\nwould entail, must be avoided at all cost. \r\nThe Middle East peace talks which opened in Washington, D.C., on \r\n24 August 1992 and which have now been suspended have given us cause for \r\noptimism. The atmosphere which has been created at the talks augurs well for \r\nserious negotiations for a comprehensive political settlement. We fully \r\nsupport the process under jay and encourage the parties to the negotiations to \r\nensure that this historic opportunity is not squandered. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n11 \r\n(President Masire) \r\nIn Afghanistan, it is our sincere hope that the establishment of a \r\ntransitional Government will silence the guns, which for 14 years wreaked \r\ndeath, misery and disaster on innocent civilians and on belligerents alike. \r\nThe international community, in particular those Member States that have \r\nstrong ties with the parties to the conflict, should bring maximum pressure to \r\nbear on the parties to refrain from resorting to the use of force in settling \r\ntheir differences. \r\nIn Somalia, a human tragedy of unspeakable dimensions is unfolding before \r\nour very eyes. According to a report of the Secretary-General contained in \r\ndocument S/24480 of 24 August 1992, famine threatens the lives of 4.5 million \r\npeople. On a daily basis, many are dying a slow and painful death. It is \r\nregrettable that the response of the international community was painfully \r\nslow at the beginning of the tragedy. However, there were, and there continue \r\nto be, men and women whose devotion to humanitarian service and reverence for \r\nhuman life are unparalleled in their quality and dimension. The International \r\nRed Cross was there when no one else was. Its dedication to alleviating human \r\nsuffering is truly extraordinary. The great son of a Lutheran pastor and 1952 \r\nNobel Peace Prize laureate. Dr. Albert Schweitzer, once said \r\n\"There is no higher religion than human service. To work for the common \r\ngood is the greatest creed.\" \r\nThe Red Cross deserves our gratitude and commendation. \r\nIn equal measure, we commend the efforts of the Secretary-General in \r\nsecuring the agreement and approbation of the parties to the conflict, in the \r\nface of immense difficulties, so that humanitarian assistance could reach the \r\nsuffering people. We also welcome the decision of the Security Council to \r\ndeploy an additional 3,000 observers in Somalia. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n12 \r\n(President Masire) \r\nIn South Africa, at the time of their suspension three difficult months \r\nago, the negotiations conducted within the framework of the Convention for a \r\nDemocratic South Africa (CODESA) had undeniably achieved positive results. A \r\nsubstantial degree of consensus had been achieved within a relatively short \r\ntime, considering that less than two years ago the apartheid edifice was still \r\nvery much intact, barely shaken, and prospects for change in South Africa were \r\nas bleak as they could be. Now, we have seen what the three-month hiatus has \r\nwrought more massacres as brutal at that at Boipatong, which caused the \r\nbreak-up of the negotiations in June. The recent one at Bisho in the \r\nBantustan of Ciskei, however, seems to have had a sobering effect on the South \r\nAfrican leaders. If anything at all, these massacres have shown that \r\nnegotiations are the only hope for South Africa, and it is with a sigh of \r\nrelief that we welcome the resumption of the negotiation process. \r\nWe welcome the keen interest the world community has shown in the South \r\nAfrican crisis, as evidenced by the adoption by the Security Council of \r\nresolution 772 (1992) of 17 August 1992. The involvement of the international \r\ncommunity in the process of change in South Africa is a very crucial element. \r\nIt is our sincere hope that the United Nations observers mentioned in \r\noperative paragraph 4 of that Security Council resolution- will be deployed in \r\nfull and kept in place throughout the process of negotiation, or as long as it \r\nis deemed necessary and vital to keep them there. \r\nProgress, if any, towards the resolution of the Western Sahara issue has \r\nbeen too slow, to say the least. The people of Western Sahara should be given \r\nthe opportunity to exercise their right to national self-determination freely \r\nand fairly under international supervision. No obstacles should be placed in \r\nthe way of the settlement olan. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n13-15 \r\n(President Masire) \r\nRecent developments in Angola and Mozambique mark the dawn of a new era \r\nin southern Africa. A situation of peace and stability is now gaining \r\nmomentum. The signing of the General Peace Agreement by the President of \r\nMozambique, Mr. Joaquim Chissano, and by the leader of RENAMO, \r\nMr. Afonso Dhlakama, is a major development in the process of bringing peace \r\nto Mozambique. Botswana contributed in its small way to the process, and I \r\nhad the honour to witness the signing of the Agreement in Rome on 4 October. \r\nI hope that the international community will extend political, diplomatic and \r\nmoral support to Mozambique in order to ensure that the Agreement is \r\ntranslated into solid peace. Millions of Mozambicans face starvation and \r\ndeath because of the war and drought. The signing of the General Peace \r\nAgreement opens the door fjr the United Nations agencies and other \r\ninternational relief agencies, and the international community as a whole, to \r\nalleviate the suffering of the people of Mozambique, as well as to assist with \r\nthe means to reconstruct their country. \r\nFor the first time since it acceded to independence in 1975, Angola held \r\nmultiparty elections last week. The high turn-out for the elections indicates \r\nthe readiness of the Angolan people to use the ballot rather than the bullet \r\nto resolve their differences. I hope that this high turn-out, coupled with \r\nfree and fair elections, will bestow legitimacy on the new Government. What \r\nis of paramount importance however, is the agreement made by the Popular \r\nMovement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the Union for the Total \r\nLiberation of Angola (UNITA) to form a Government of national unity \r\nirrespective of whichever party wins the elections. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n16 \r\n(President Masire) \r\nThis is the second time the United Nations has successfully supervised \r\nmultiparty elections in southern Africa. The role of the United Nations in \r\nthe peace process in Angola is therefore truly commendable. \r\nThere is an intricate relationship between peace and security and \r\neconomic and social development. There can be no doubt that the problems of \r\npoverty, unemployment, huge foreign debt, budget deficits, lack of market \r\naccess, high interest rates and the environment are not the problems of any \r\none country or group of countries. No one country can solve them in isolation. \r\nThe macroeconomic management of the global economy should now be guided \r\nby the need to serve common interests. There should be an end to the \r\nperception of problems as being exclusively those of the North or of the \r\nSouth. A new approach is required, one that will identify the common problems \r\nof humanity and build on the consensus. We should put an end to mutual \r\ndistrust, and move away from perceiving the economic concerns of countries as \r\nbeing mutually exclusive and permanently at loggerheads. This is not a \r\nzero-sum game. \r\nThe lessons of our recent past should guide us. The world was united in \r\nits opposition to aggression against Kuwait, and concerted efforts were made \r\nto mobilize resources in support of the countries of Eastern Europe and the \r\nCommonwealth of Independent States; all of this showed an acceptance of the \r\nvalidity of the concepts of interdependence, partnership and the \"global \r\nvillage.\" \r\nIn 1993 a World Conference on Human Rights will be held, followed by the \r\n1994 Conference on Population and Development. And in 1995, as the United \r\nNations celebrates its golden jubilee, the World Conference on Women will take \r\nplace. This attests to the fact that these are shared human problems and \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n17 \r\n(President Masire) \r\ntherefore require our collective endeavours. There should be a move away from \r\nthe temptation to accord the highest priority to human rights and democracy, \r\nto the detriment of other areas of primary concern. It serves no useful \r\npurpose to have priorities based solely on political considerations and what \r\nare perceived as strategic national interests. \r\nDemocracy is threatened when the legitimate expectations of the people \r\nare frustrated by economic deprivation. In this regard, we strongly support \r\nthe proposal to convene a world summit for social development in 1995. It is \r\nour fervent hope that a co-isensus decision will be reached on this matter of \r\ncritical importance to the world as a whole. The Summit should afford the \r\ninternational community the opportunity to address in an integrated manner the \r\nproblems of poverty, illiteracy, disease, unemployment and poor living \r\nconditions. \r\nThe economic situation in Africa is still bleak. Africa continues to \r\nexperience a crushing debt burden, falling commodity prices and painful \r\nstructural adjustment programmes. The economies of many African countries \r\nhave stagnated or retrogressed during the past year. The African economic \r\ncrisis is a development challenge to mankind\u0027s collective conscience. \r\nConcerted efforts should be made to translate the United Nations New Agenda \r\nfor Africa into concrete programmes and projects that can put our continent on \r\nthe path to economic recovery and development. The Global Coalition for \r\nAfrica (GCA), which I have the honour to co-chair on behalf of Africa, has \r\nmade a signifioant contribution to the new consensus-building process since \r\nits inception in Maastricht in 1990. As a forum that brings together, at the \r\nhighest level, policy makers from Africa and its international partners, the \r\nGCA has great potential in the search for solutions to Africa\u0027s most critical \r\ndevelopment issues. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n18-20 \r\n(President Masire) \r\nThe GCA is a forum for equal engagement, for openness to policy decisions \r\nand for great seriousness. Our partnership with the North requires our most \r\ndetermined leadership. It is important that the GCA be Africa-driven, and it \r\nis in the interest of Africa to have a forum based on equal partnership. \r\nAs Chairman of the former Southern African Development Coordination \r\nConference (SADCC), I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the member States \r\nrecently signed in Windhoek, Namibia, a Treaty and Protocol establishing the \r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC). This historic development is \r\npart of the overall efforts of the countries of the subregion to enhance and \r\nintensify inter-regional cooperation. \r\nSADCC had been in existence for 12 years as a loose arrangement between \r\nmembers. Those very fruitful years armed us with the courage, wisdom and \r\nexperience to transform the loose arrangement that was the SADCC into the \r\nformal entity that is the SADC. The establishment of SADC is part and parcel \r\nof continental efforts to create an African economic community; it is without \r\na doubt one of the community\u0027s building blocks. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n21 \r\n(President Masire) \r\nThe establishment of SADC takes place against the backdrop of a serious \r\ndrought crisis ravaging southern Africa. The response of the international \r\ncommunity has been very positive, but the magnitude of the crisis is \r\ndaunting. The scope and extent of its impact continue to unfold, \r\nnecessitating a revised estimation of the resources needed to alleviate the \r\nplight of the most seriously affected populations. We appeal to the members \r\nof the international donor community who have not yet done so to convert their \r\npledges into concrete contributions to avert a human tragedy. \r\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development adopted a \r\nnumber of important decisions which are now before the General Assembly for \r\nfollow-up and implementation. We attach the utmost importance to the Rio \r\nDeclaration on Environment and Development and the Programme of Action \r\noutlined in Agenda 21. In this regard, we fully support the recommendation to \r\nthe General Assembly on the establishment of a high-level commission on \r\nsustainable development. The Rio Summit was the beginning of a process which \r\nshould now find concrete expression in the form of the commitment by Member \r\nStates to honour their obligations. Of particular importance is the need for \r\nresources to implement Agenda 21. \r\nDrought and desertification threaten the economic prospects of many \r\ndeveloping countries. It is imperative that urgent measures be taken to find \r\nan integrated solution to the problem. We strongly believe that this can be \r\ndone within the framework of negotiations on a convention on desertification. \r\nThis is a matter of critical importance to many African States, and a positive \r\ndecision will contribute substantially to the search for solutions to the \r\neconomic malaise facing our continent. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n22 \r\n(President Masire) \r\nI should like to conclude by reaffirming Botswana\u0027s abiding faith in the \r\nUnited Nations and its Charter. We are ready to play our part in our common \r\nendeavour to strengthen the Organization to enable it to face the challenges \r\nof the twenty-first century. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe President of the Republic of Botswana for the statement he has just made. \r\nSir Ketumile Masire. President of the Republic of Botswana, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall. \r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued) \r\nGENERAL DEBATE \r\nSir Baddeley DEVESI (Solomon Islands): It is an honour and \r\nprivilege for me to address this forty-seventh session of the United Nations \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\nOn behalf of the Government and people of Solomon Islands, I should like \r\nto express our sincere congratulations to you. Sir, on your election to the \r\npresidency of the Assembly. I am confident that under your able leadership \r\nmuch will be achieved. I should also like to convey our sincere thanks and \r\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi, for his outstanding \r\nleadership during the forty-sixth session. \r\nSolomon Islands joins the United Nations community in congratulating and \r\nwelcoming Mr. Boutros-Ghali, our new Secretary-General. Mr. Boutros-Ghali has \r\nindeed an important and challenging task ahead. I assure the \r\nSecretary-General of my Government\u0027s continued support and cooperation. \r\nMuch has happened since the last session of the General Assembly. Like \r\nthe rest of the world community, Solomon Islands has viewed with interest the \r\npolitical developments in Eastern Europe since the latter half of 1991. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n23-25 \r\n(Sir Baddelev Devest. \r\nSolomon Islands) \r\nSelf-determination has certainly taken its course. The former republics and \r\nStates of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia have now gained their freedom to \r\ngovern and pursue their own destinies. We observe with concern, however, that \r\nthese changes have had some negative results. \r\nIt is worth noting that as a result of these changes a number of former \r\nrepublics and States have now become Members of this world body. In the same \r\nspirit as previous speakers, Solomon Islands would like to congratulate the \r\nnewly independent States of Georgia, Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina. The presence of those countries with us in this world forum not \r\nonly binds us closely, but brings home a message of unity, hope and peace.* \r\n* Mr. Mongbe (Benin), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n26 \r\n(Sir Baddeley Devesi, \r\nSolomon Islands) \r\nDespite this message, Solomon Islands has learned with dismay about the \r\nrecent killings of the civilian population and United Nations personnel in \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. We condemn this atrocious act. In this connection, \r\nSolomon Islands fully supports the various measures undertaken by the United \r\nNations. \r\nI now turn to the Middle East. Solomon Islands would like to register \r\nits recognition of the countries which have played a prominent role in the \r\nMiddle East peace initiative. We appreciate the complexities of the conflict \r\nand acknowledge the initiatives taken by the parties involved to find a \r\npeaceful and lasting solution. Solomon Islands urges those with the necessary \r\nresources and the will to do so, to continue to play a mediating and \r\nsupportive role in this process. In this context, Solomon Islands would like \r\nto raise the questions where and how the United Nations can best play its role \r\nin facilitating this effort. Given the emerging trend towards peace, Solomon \r\nIslands calls on the United Nations to be both sensitive and responsive in \r\nadopting resolutions. We look forward to more positive participation by the \r\nUnited Nations in this regard. \r\nWe should like to highlight issues that are of concern closer to home, \r\nthe South Pacific. As the current Chairman of the South Pacific Forum, \r\nSolomon Islands has an obligation to convey to this body the aspirations and \r\nconcerns of the region. At the twenty-third meeting of the South Pacific \r\nForum in Solomon Islands i 1 July this year, a number of issues of concern to \r\nthe region were discussed. These included environmental, trade and economic, \r\npolitical and security issues. \r\nThe South Pacific region is unique because the marine environment is an \r\nintegral part of our existence. Our people, perhaps more than others around \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n27 \r\n(Sir Baddelev Devest. \r\nSolomon Islands) \r\nthe globe, depend on the sea, the land, the rivers and the forests for their \r\nimmediate livelihood. But poor development planning and global environmental \r\nproblems, such as climate change and the associated raising of the sea level, \r\nare becoming a threat to our resources and aspirations. For this reason, our \r\nregion places environmental issues high on our agenda. Solomon Islands fully \r\nrecognizes the important outcome of the United Nations Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development, including the Rio de Janeiro Declaration, \r\nAgenda 21, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the \r\nConvention on Biological Diversity and the statement of principles on \r\nforests. We also endorse the concept of sustainable development, in which \r\nenvironmental protection constitutes an integral part of the development \r\nprocess. We are concerned, however, that the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change has not sufficiently addresed the issue of global \r\nwarming. We therefore earnestly urge the early commencement of the \r\nnegotiations on protocols to implement and elaborate upon the Convention and \r\nwe humbly reguest that this be treated as a matter of urgency. \r\nSolomon Islands welcomes the decision of France to suspend its nuclear \r\ntesting in our region. The suspension has led to an improvement in the \r\nrelations between France and the countries in the region. It is hoped that \r\nFrance will endeavour to cease nuclear testing activities in the South Pacific \r\nfor all time. \r\nSolomon Islands believes that environmental education and the need to \r\ncreate public awareness of environmental and related issues should form the \r\nfoundation for an implemen;ation strategy for Agenda 21. My Government is \r\nconvinced that without educating the youth of today, who will be the adults of \r\ntomorrow, we will merely bj paying lip-service to these conventions. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n28 \r\n(Sir Baddeley Devest. \r\nSolomon Islands) \r\ndeclarations and principles on environment. In other words, sustainable \r\ndevelopment of the environment and its protection demand relevant and \r\ncost-effective educational programmes aimed at both the formal and the \r\nnon-formal sectors of our education systems. \r\nAs a step towards implementing Agenda 21, the primary and secondary \r\ncurriculums in Solomon Islands are being reviewed with a view to introducing \r\nand improving the quality of environmental science education in schools. \r\nWhile we might have the initiative and the motivation to enhance environmental \r\neducation programmes, the success of these undertakings is contingent on \r\nfinancial and technical assistance from the richer nations. It was heartening \r\nto hear, during the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development \r\nin Brazil, that developed countries have committed themselves to providing \r\n\"new and additional\" financial assistance to enable developing countries to \r\nmeet their obligations as stipulated under the conventions. \r\nOn economic and trade matters, Solomon Islands recognizes the adverse \r\nimpact which the global macro-economic trends have on its economy, which is \r\nboth open to, and susceptible to, external change. We realize that while the \r\ninitiative to begin economic reforms must come from the country itself, \r\nregional and international co-operation in such efforts is also very vital. \r\nSolomon Islands is at present pursuing a programme of structural \r\nadjustment. This programme emphasizes, first, active and effective \r\nprivate-sector participation; secondly, sustainable utilization of both human \r\nand natural resources; thirdly, privatization of government-owned companies; \r\nand fourthly, streamlining of the public service within the government. Being \r\nsmall, however, Solomon Islands cannot pursue such a programme effectively on \r\nits own. Success must depend on strategic regional development planning. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n29-30 \r\n(Sir Baddelev Devesi. \r\nSolomon Islands) \r\nproper coordination of development programmes, and the mobilization of \r\nresources to meet the needs. It also depends on the willingness and the \r\ncommitment of those with financial resources to be involved. In view of these \r\nreforms, it is our sincere hope that the international financial institutions \r\nand donor countries will support our efforts to achieve our goals and \r\nobjectives. \r\nThe vulnerability of small island countries to external and internal \r\nsecurity threats is not a new issue in this forum. It has been a major \r\nsubject of extensive discussion and debate over the past years. We are \r\nraising the issue again because, despite the end of the cold war, there has \r\nbeen little improvement in the situation in our region. Undesirable, criminal \r\nand atrocious activities and behaviour, both from within and outside the \r\nregion, continue to threaten the sovereignty, security and economic integrity \r\nof the South Pacific countries. \r\nAt the twenty-third meeting of the South Pacific Forum in Honiara, \r\nSolomon Islands, in July 1992, the Forum agreed on a Declaration on Law \r\nEnforcement Cooperation. This Declaration identifies priority areas and \r\nestablishes a framework within which security activities are to be pursued. \r\nBut these undesirable activities cannot be addressed at the regional level \r\nalone. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n31 \r\n(Sir Baddeley Devesi. \r\nSolomon Islands) \r\nFor the long-term peace and stability of the South Pacific region, or any \r\nother region for that matter, the involvement of and collaboration with \r\nrelevant international agencies is vital. \r\nOn decolonization, the Solomon Islands notes with appreciation the \r\npositive measures pursued in New Caledonia by the French authorities in the \r\nimplementation of the Matignon Accord. We encourage a continuing dialogue \r\namong all political parties in the territory. This is to ensure that \r\nself-determination consistent with the principles and practices of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, in a framework within which all options, including \r\nthat of independence, is achieved. We encourage regular contacts and \r\ninteractions by the Kanaks and other New Caledonians with their South Pacific \r\nneighbours to give them courage and confidence as they prepare themselves to \r\ntake on greater roles in their affairs. \r\nAs a small nation, Solomon Islands sees the United Nations system as an \r\neffective insurance framework for our peace and security, fully realizing, of \r\ncourse, that we have no military forces or military hardware. To this \r\nimportant extent, we hail with gratification the Secretary-General\u0027s \"Agenda \r\nfor Peace\", which highlights preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping, peacemaking \r\nand peace-building as a fresh challenge to our Organization in the future. We \r\nrecognize these measures as they are defined in his report to be worthy of the \r\nattention of all Member States. \r\nTo conclude, may I on behalf of the Government and people of \r\nSolomon Islands thank the United Nations for its continued interest and \r\nassistance in the development of our country. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n32 \r\n(Sir Baddelev Devest. \r\nSolomon Islands) \r\nI should like to place on record my Government\u0027s appreciation to the \r\nUnited Nations and the United Nations Missions in New York for their tributes \r\nand messages of condolence in honour of our former Permanent Representative to \r\nthe United Nations, the late Mr. Francis Bugotu. \r\nMr. KALPAGE (Sri Lanka): The delegation of Sri Lanka congratulates \r\nMr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria on his election as President of the forty-seventh \r\nsession of the General Assembly. We assure him of our full co-operation and \r\nsupport. \r\nWe wish to record our deep appreciation of the determined manner in which \r\nhis predecessor. His Excellency Samir S. Shihabi, conducted the affairs of the \r\nforty-sixth session and of the keen interest he took in moving forward the \r\nprocess of revitalization of the General Assembly. \r\nWe welcome the new Member States and wish them every success in their \r\nlegitimate national and international endeavours. \r\nIt is my special honour to convey to the General Assembly the greetings \r\nof the President of Sri Lanka, His Excellency Ranasinghe Premadasa, and his \r\nsincere good wishes for the efforts of the United Nations to ensure a just and \r\npeaceful world. \r\nThe cold war is over. Momentous developments continue to dominate the \r\ninternational scene. The consequences of these developments for a peaceful \r\nworld have yet to fully unfold. New independent States have emerged. The \r\ntransition to a stable and equitable order is full of uncertainties and \r\nchallenges. Several peace initiatives to resolve conflicts offer hope. \r\nNevertheless, there is simmering discontent within and among nations. Unrest \r\nand turmoil prevail in parts of the world. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n33-35 \r\n(Mr. Kalpaoe. Sri Lanka) \r\nThe violence in the territories of former Yugoslavia continues unabated. \r\nThe tragedy in Somalia appals and shames the human conscience. The peace \r\nprocesses that began in Afghanistan and Cambodia have encountered setbacks. \r\nIn South Africa a non-racial and democratic Government is yet to be \r\nestablished. The question of Palestine still remains on our agenda. We hope \r\nthat the Middle East peace process will enable that troubled region to soon \r\nenjoy the peace for which its peoples yearn. \r\nWe thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his \r\ncomprehensive report on the work of the Organization in these and other areas \r\nof activity during the year. \r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s report on an \"Agenda for Peace\" is innovative and \r\nchallenging. The proposals in his report must be considered with the care and \r\nseriousness they deserve given the instabilities that prevail and the \r\nuncertainties that lie ahead. The central focal-point for any action in this \r\nregard should be a revitalized and democratized United Nations. \r\nThe Secretary-General himself has observed that \"the foundation stone to \r\nthis work is and must remain the State\". The fundamental sovereignty and \r\nintegrity of the State are crucial to any common progress we seek to achieve. \r\nPreventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and post-conflict peace \r\nbuilding must be pursued in a manner that meets the legitimate aspirations of \r\nall Member States. \r\nIn keeping with the principles of universality and sovereign equality, \r\nthe post-cold war peace process must encompass and involve all Member States. \r\nThis is fundamental to the legal and moral authority of the United Nations. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n36 \r\n(Mr. Kalpage. Sri Lanka) \r\nThe General Assembly should continue to be the principal policy-making \r\nbody of the Organization. We support all efforts to ensure more effective \r\nfunctioning of the General Assembly as a forum of multilateral diplomacy to \r\nachieve our common objectives. \r\nThe role of the United Nations in conflict prevention and conflict \r\nresolution should be pragmatic. It should contribute to the stability and \r\nlong-term viability of the international system. The Secretary-General has \r\nreminded us that unlimited \"fragmentation\" of sovereign entities would make it \r\nmore difficult to achieve peace, security and economic well-being for all. \r\nExternal intervention in any guise cannot be justified, except in accordance \r\nwith the provisions of the Charter, particularly in cases where domestic \r\nsolutions have not been entirely exhausted. \r\nTo ensure the efficacy of our collective efforts towards fulfilling the \r\n\"Agenda for Peace\", it is imperative that the United Nations assume a decisive \r\nrole in formulating and putting into effect an \"agenda for development\". \r\nLasting solutions can be found only through enlightened \r\ndevelopment-cooperation policies pursued in tandem with strategies for \r\npreventive diplomacy. \r\nAs the principal organ entrusted with the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, the Security Council now functions without the shackles \r\nthat made it ineffective during the cold war. However, its present \r\nconfiguration continues to reflect the realities of the immediate-post-war \r\npower structure. The Security Council could be made more representative. It \r\nis important that its procedures be democratic and transparent. Its decisions \r\nshould reflect consensus, arrived at after proper discussion, and respect for \r\nnational sovereignty. There should be a better balance in the relationship \r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security Council. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Kalpaoe. Sri Lanka) \r\nThe restructuring of the United Nations in its economic and social areas \r\nhas already begun. There is a need for better coordination of global economic \r\npolicies and for more effective policy-making and policy-implementation. \r\nCoordination and integration of operational activities of the specialized \r\nagencies and other bodies, functioning under the Economic and Social Council, \r\nand strengthening of the field presence of the United Nations have become \r\nvital. This will reduce duplication, inefficiency and a too-diffused focus of \r\nUnited Nations assistance. The ultimate aim of the reforms must be to enable \r\nthe United Nations to be more effective in the promotion of development \r\ncooperation for social and economic progress. However, in our enthusiasm to \r\nreform the United Nations in the social and economic fields, we must maintain \r\nthe principles of democracy, universality and respect for the sovereignty of \r\nStates. \r\nWe wish to commend the Secretary-General for his bold initiatives in \r\nstreamlining the work of the Secretariat. We hope that continuing efforts to \r\nmaximize efficiency in the Secretariat will not diminish, but will enhance, \r\nthe capacity of the United Nations to respond to the pressing socio-economic \r\nneeds of the developing world. \r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General\u0027s efforts to reorganize the Secretariat \r\nand to utilize fully its human resources. These efforts should be matched by \r\nMember States\u0027 meeting their obligation under the Charter to make available \r\nthe required financial resources. If the present financial crisis of the \r\nUnited Nations is to be resolved, these resources must be provided on time. \r\nThis year has witnessed a reaffirmation, by the nations of the \r\nBon-Aligned Movement, of the validity and relevance of non-alignment and of \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n38 \r\n(Mr. Kalpage. Sri r.anfra) \r\nits basic approach in addressing international problems and development. The \r\ntenth Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in Jakarta last \r\nmonth, emphasized the need to build a new and eguitable international order \r\nbased on political and economic democracy both within and between nations. \r\nThe Jakarta Message conveys a clear consensus that the Non-Aligned Movement is \r\nnot a captive of its nomenclature, which reflects the historical context in \r\nwhich the first Summit Conference took place. \r\nIn our commitment to promote and preserve the \"dignity and worth of the \r\nhuman person\" we believe that the best defence of human rights lies in \r\ndemocracy and openness in societies. \r\nFor over half a century Sri Lanka has had a proud record of uninterrupted \r\nuniversal adult franchise and respect for the electoral verdict. My country \r\nis a party to the Covenants on human rights. In Sri Lanka, steps are being \r\ntaken to establish a human-rights commission to strengthen the fulfilment of \r\nour constitutional obligations relating to fundamental rights. We have an \r\nenduring commitment to both national and international accountability. \r\nSri Lanka\u0027s policy of openness and of cooperation with national and \r\ninternational bodies in the field of human rights is derived from democratic \r\ntraditions and institutions that are an integral part of Sri Lanka\u0027s value \r\nsystem. \r\nSocio-economic aspects of human-rights problems have found their \r\nmanifestations everywhere. This is evident from violent and undemocratic \r\nexpressions of grievances in both developing and developed countries. We \r\nbelieve that a cooperative rather than a coercive approach would help \r\ninternational action to achieve the desired results in the field of human \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n39-40 \r\n(Mr. Kalpaoe. Sri Lanka) \r\nrights. Sri Lanka will participate constructively in the World Conference on \r\nHuman Rights in 1993 to develop such a positive approach to the promotion of \r\nhuman rights world-wide. \r\nInternational peace, security and development are indivisible. It is no \r\nlonger possible to conceive of security essentially in military terms. The \r\ncold-war era, in which a highly militarized concept of security dominated \r\nEast-West relations, is over. Today, socio-economic factors have become major \r\ndeterminants of global security. Multilateral disarmament and world peace and \r\nsecurity are inextricably linked. This makes it necessary for the United \r\nNations to play the central role in global disarmament. The United Nations \r\nshould also be a catalyst in facilitating regional disarmament. \r\nThe monitoring of the illegal arms trade and its elimination should be a \r\npriority on the multilateral agenda on disarmament and conflict prevention. \r\nThe illegal arms trade and the highly destructive evils of drug trafficking \r\nand terrorism are interlinked and mutually supportive. States should not \r\npermit their territories or their citizens to be used for the perpetration of \r\nacts of destabilization against other States through support for, or tolerance \r\nof, arms smuggling drug trafficking and terrorism. Multilateral action to \r\naddress these real threats faced by democratic societies should constitute an \r\nindispensable element of the peace agenda of the United Nations. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n41 \r\n(Mr. Kalpaoe. Sri Lanka) \r\nSri Lanka strongly supported multilateral negotiations aimed at a total \r\nprohibition of the entire chemical weapons cycle. The successful conclusion \r\nof the convention on chemical weapons demonstrates the competence of the \r\nUnited Nations in multilateral negotiations. Sri Lanka was among those \r\ncountries which signified an early interest in becoming an original signatory \r\nto the convention. We hope that States parties to this convention will \r\npromote international cooperation in the peaceful uses of chemicals in \r\naccordance with its letter and spirit. \r\nEfforts to establish a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean continue. In \r\nview of the changing international situation, the United Nations Ad Hoc \r\nCommittee on the Indian Ocean was of the view that the General Assembly might \r\nwish to consider alternative approaches. The Tenth Non-Aligned Summit Meeting \r\nin Jakarta took cognizance of this view and reiterated the determination to \r\ncontinue efforts to achieve the goals of the Declaration as considered at the \r\nmeeting of littoral and hinterland States held in 1979. We hope that the new \r\nspirit of cooperation evident elsewhere in the world will embrace the Indian \r\nOcean region as well. \r\nMy delegation is pleased with the conclusions reached at the United \r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro. We \r\nendorse the principles enunciated in the Rio Declaration, the programmes in \r\nAgenda 21, the commitment to a shared partnership by the provision of adequate \r\nnew and additional funding and the transfer of the necessary technologies to \r\ndeveloping countries. Sri Lanka has signed the Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change and the Con -ention on Biological Diversity. We expect that the \r\ncreation of a commission for sustainable development will without delay move \r\nforward the process of ensuring the sustainable development to which all \r\nnations and peoples committed themselves in Rio de Janeiro. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Kalpaoe. Sri Lanka) \r\nThe United Nations mu .t take a visionary perspective in shaping the \r\nfuture of a world already transformed into a global village by modern \r\ntechnology. Yet, developing countries are still in a disadvantaged position \r\nowing to the non-availability of the necessary technologies. Among these, \r\nspace technology is useful in the monitoring of the changing global \r\nenvironment and can assist developing countries in maximizing the use of their \r\nresources. \r\nHowever, the high cost of space and other advanced technologies prevents \r\ndeveloping countries from reaping their potential benefits. The United \r\nNations and its specialized agencies must therefore work to ensure equitable \r\naccess to these technologies so that the benefits can be shared by all. This \r\nwill enable the development of a new regime of technological democracy. \r\nThe Convention on the Law of the Sea was signed 10 years ago. The \r\nPreparatory Commission continues to labour painstakingly to ensure that the \r\nresources of the seas and oceans a common heritage of mankind will be used \r\nfor the benefit of all. We welcome the initiative of the Secretary-General to \r\nbring about universal participation in the Convention. \r\nIn different parts of the world regional organizations are being \r\nstrengthened. Sri Lanka hid the honour this year to be elected as Chairman of \r\nthe South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC). The dynamic \r\nleadership of His Excellency Ranasinghe Premadasa, President of Sri Lanka, has \r\nsignificantly moved forward cooperation among the seven States members of \r\nSAARC on a number of initiatives. \r\nA South Asian Commission on Poverty Alleviation, established this year, \r\nwill enable fresh approaches to be taken on the basis of shared experiences in \r\nalleviating poverty in our populous region. Sri Lanka\u0027s own approach has been \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n43 \r\n(Mr. Kalpaoe. Sri Lanka) \r\nto provide opportunities and access to the poor to participate actively and \r\nproductively as partners in national development, rather than being treated as \r\npassive recipients of charity. \r\nA South Asian Preferential Trading Agreement (SAPTA) seeks to promote \r\ntrade and commerce among SAARC countries. Efforts to expand cultural \r\nexchanges and to enhance people-to-people contact at various levels are under \r\nway. Regional recognition has been granted to the SAARC Chambers of Commerce \r\nand Industries. \r\nThe Second SAARC Ministerial Conference on Children in South Asia was \r\nheld in Colombo in September. The Conference resolved to set up several goals \r\nand a time frame for their achievement. The specific goals deal with \r\neducation, child-welfare and children\u0027s rights. \r\nSAARC is also looking forward to promoting mutually beneficial \r\ncooperation with other regional and international organizations. \r\nThis has been a year of heightened activity in the SAARC region. The \r\ncountries of our region are determined to maintain this momentum. \r\nIn this context I quote the words of our President, His Excellency \r\nRanasinghe Premadasa: \r\n\"A sense of innovation must animate SAARC cooperation. We cannot \r\nremain static. Fresh and imaginative approaches are needed. We have to \r\nface new challenges. New ways have to be found to deal with old problems \r\nthat have lingered, defying solutions. \r\n\"We in South Asia, have the ability to forge together a unity based \r\non our ancient ties. Let us accept the challenge to build together a \r\nsolidarity of mutual respect; one which will strengthen each individual \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n44-45 \r\n(Mr. Kalpaoe. Sri Lanka) \r\nnation in its independence. A solidarity which will weld our nations \r\ninto a purposeful and dynamic unity. We will be then be able to face \r\nwith confidence our common future\". \r\nThese sentiments are a beacon for regional cooperation in South Asia. \r\nIn meeting the challenges that lie ahead it is abundantly clear that the \r\nUnited Nations offers the best hope for humankind. The strong and the weak, \r\nthe rich and the poor, the industrialized and the developing are all \r\nrepresented here. It is only through our deliberations that the problems of \r\nour world come into global focus and solutions can be provided accordingly. \r\nFor the first time after the Charter of the United Nations was signed in \r\nSan Francisco, 47 years ago, the peoples of the world through their \r\nrepresentatives here assembled have it in their power to provide new \r\ndirections for ensuring peace, security, prosperity and social justice in \r\nkeeping with today\u0027s realities. The challenges are many; equally, the \r\nopportunities are great. We owe it to the millions who crave eguity and \r\njustice and a better life in larger freedom that we shoulder our \r\nresponsibilities with courage and perseverance. We cannot afford to falter or \r\nfail. We must succeed. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n46 \r\nMr. KING (Barbados): It is a pleasure for me to congratulate \r\nMr. Ganev on his unanimous election to the presidency of the Assembly at its \r\nforty-seventh session. I am confident that our deliberations will benefit \r\nfrom his wise leadership. \r\nI also commend his predecessor, Mr. Samir Shihabi, for the outstanding \r\nstewardship he provided during the course of the last year, and I take this \r\nopportunity too to extend my personal welcome and good wishes to our new \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. \r\nI am pleased to greet the many new Members that have joined the United \r\nNations family since the beginning of the last session and to offer them the \r\nfull cooperation of the delegation of Barbados as we work together to shape \r\nthe international order for the twenty-first century. \r\nThe old world order has disintegrated at an astonishing pace. \r\nAssumptions and doctrines based on the cold-war balance of power have lost \r\ntheir relevance. At the same time, ambitious expectations have been created \r\nfor the emergence of a new world order based on peaceful coexistence, economic \r\nequity and social justice. \r\nThe transition, however, has proved more traumatic and destabilizing than \r\nthe propitious circumstances would have suggested. The energies for \r\nrevolutionary change need to be positively directed so that prospects for \r\ninternational peace are not threatened by the resurgence of ancient ethnic and \r\ntribal conflicts and the violent clash of nationalistic rivalries. \r\nRegrettably, there are alarming manifestations of that new threat in \r\nYugoslavia and Somalia. \r\nBarbados is appalled at the savagery with which the protagonists of \r\nethnic strife in what was once Yugoslavia are pursuing their misguided notions \r\nof nationalism and sovereignty. Such barbarism, including the horrendous \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. King. Barbados) \r\npractice of \"ethnic cleansing\", has no place in our modern world. Its \r\nperpetrators must be made to understand the outrage of the international \r\ncommunity at their actions. My country fully supports the regime of sanctions \r\nimposed by the Security Council and the dedicated efforts of the European \r\nCommunity and the United Nations to create the conditions for a peaceful \r\nsettlement and to bring relief to the hundreds of thousands of innocent \r\ncivilian victims. \r\nEqually disturbing is the desperate situation in Somalia, which, \r\nregrettably, has only recently attracted the international attention it \r\ndeserves, and then only at the sharp prodding of the Secretary-General. \r\nBarbados supports regional and international efforts towards the convening of \r\no conference on national reconciliation and unity in Somalia and towards \r\ncreating secure conditions for humanitarian action. \r\nMy country commends the Secretary General\u0027s report \"An Agenda for Peace\" \r\nto the Assembly for its careful study. A number of its recommendations are \r\nconsistent with the views contained in my statement to the General Assembly at \r\nits forty-sixth session, namely, the need to strengthen the capability of the \r\nSecretary-General for preventive diplomacy; the need to put into place the \r\npermanent enforcement tools required under Article 43 of the Charter to deter, \r\nand in the last resort, counter aggression; and the need to make full use of \r\nthe appropriate regional and subregional security arrangements under \r\nChapter VIII of the Charter. We also support his call for greater recourse to \r\nthe International Court of Justice for the peaceful adjudication of disputes. \r\nMy delegation supports the view of the Secretary-General that there is an \r\nurgent necessity to put peace-keeping operations on a sound financial \r\nfooting. His recommendations and other positive suggestions should be given \r\nPriority study. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n48 \r\n(Mr. King. Barbados) \r\nA number of small countries have been unable to play a part in \r\ntraditional United Nations peace-keeping simply because they have lacked the \r\nlogistical military capability for so doing. The expanded dimensions of \r\npeace-keeping, however, provide the possibility for participation by small \r\nStates in other fields in which they have expertise, such as electoral \r\nsupervision, human-rights monitoring and the supply of police and civilian \r\npersonnel. Such participation should be encouraged and facilitated by the \r\nOrganization. In this regard, my delegation has noted with interest the \r\nNorwegian proposal for the establishment of a special United Nations institute \r\nfor education and training in peace-keeping and related activities as a means \r\nto respond to these new dimensions. \r\nWhile we cannot fail to recognize the indispensable nature of United \r\nNations peace-keeping operations, my country is nevertheless concerned at the \r\ndramatic escalation in their costs and would wish to see more stringent \r\ncontrols and oversight in place to ensure efficient use of the billions of \r\ndollars now involved. \r\nAn agenda for peace requires a supportive economic environment. A new \r\nworld order must be developed around the central priority of closing the gap \r\nbetween North and South, \u0027.\u0027his requires courageous leadership on the part of \r\nthe North to create the opportunities for sustainable economic and social \r\ndevelopment in the South through genuine trade liberalization, meaningful \r\ndebt-relief strategies and positive resource transfers. It also requires \r\nresponsible management; sound, people-oriented development planning; and the \r\ncreation of the appropriate environment for development on the part of the \r\nSouth. \r\nThe United Nations is a critical forum for the resuscitation of the \r\ninternational economic dialogue. Barbados welcomes the serious debate now \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n49-50 \r\n(Mr. King. Barbados) \r\ntaking place on reforming and strengthening the economic and social mandate of \r\nthe United Nations. Any such reform must be consistent with the provisions of \r\nthe Charter and seek to ensure universality and accessibility. Care must be \r\ntaken not to exclude the small and powerless from the process. Regrettably, \r\nhowever, the emphasis currently given to developmental issues within the \r\nadministrative structure of the Organization does not reflect the priority \r\naccorded to those issues by the majority of Member States. My delegation \r\naccepts that the maintenance of international peace and security is a major \r\nresponsibility of the United Nations. We strongly support the view that peace \r\nand economic and social well-being are indivisible and that issues relating to \r\ndevelopment must be given emphasis equal to that given to issues relating to \r\npeace. \r\nIt is important that the United Nations be a forum for constructive \r\nconsensus-building, where all points of view no matter the size of their \r\nproponents or how much influence they wield are given equal attention and \r\nrespect. A new world order cannot evolve except in an atmosphere of free and \r\nopen dialogue, consultation and transparency in decision-making. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. King. Barbados) \r\nThere is considerable merit in the argument that the Security Council in \r\nthe post-cold-war era should be updated to reflect the new international \r\npolitical and economic realities, as well as the balance and diversity \r\nnecessary for its decisions, if it is to command universal acceptance and \r\nrespect. \r\nA very topical issue in this forum in recent times has been the dialogue \r\non what the Secretary-General has termed \"the democratization of international \r\nrelations and the participation of all States in developing new norms of \r\ninternational life\". There have been calls for the redefinition of the \r\nconcept of State sovereignty in international law, and many States have \r\naccepted as a matter of policy the notion of the right to intervene on \r\nhumanitarian grounds and for the protection of human rights, and have \r\nadvocated the universal application of such a principle. \r\nMy country has always been outspoken on the universal need to protect and \r\nstrengthen the principles of democracy and respect for fundamental human \r\nrights. We have consistently condemned abuses, wherever and whenever they \r\nhave occurred, and long before the resurgence of democratic values in our \r\nregion and elsewhere made it popular or safe to do so. Our actions have \r\nalways been motivated strictly by principle and objectivity, and not by \r\nideological considerations that have served in the past to politicize the \r\ndebate. \r\nThe disappearance of ideological polarization gives the international \r\ncommunity an unprecedented opportunity to influence the dialogue on this vital \r\nissue in a balanced and constructive way. There is need to ensure respect for \r\nfundamental human rights; out there is egual need to take care to promote \r\nimpartial standards for measuring adherence to, and for guarding scrupulously \r\nagainst manipulation of, the debate to suit the narrow foreign policy \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. King. Barbados) \r\ninterests of particular States. What is needed in the ensuing dialogue is the \r\nsensitive and sensible application of universally agreed standards, not the \r\nimposition of new forms of conditionality devoid of all historical or cultural \r\ncontext. \r\nThe World Conference on Human Rights, scheduled to be held in Vienna in \r\nJune 1993, will present a unique opportunity not only to review the progress \r\nmade in human rights since 1948, but also to formulate recommendations aimed \r\nat charting the course of human rights well into the twenty-first century. \r\nThe tragic situation of the people of Haiti remains a major preoccupation \r\nof the Government and people of Barbados and of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM) as a whole. We have made clear our outright condemnation of the \r\nusurpation of the authority of the legitimate government of \r\nPresident Aristide, and have collaborated with our regional partners in \r\nCARICOM and the Organization of American States (OAS) in the effort to restore \r\nthat government. We have supported the OAS-imposed embargo and the Protocol \r\nof Washington. It is clear, however, that no lasting solution can be found, \r\nexcept in a context that neutralizes the power of a brutal and lawless \r\nmilitary, which continues with impunity its flagrant abuses of the human \r\nrights of the Haitian people. The international community has a special \r\nobligation towards the people of Haiti, whose electoral process was monitored \r\nand authenticated at every step with direct United Nations involvement. If \r\nsuch a process can be overturned with impunity, what message are we sending to \r\nthe world of would-be dictators, and what assurance are we providing for the \r\nfledgling democracies in our region? It is imperative that the United Nations \r\ntake action to internationalize the embargo and to contribute, in whatever \r\nways are considered appropriate and useful, to OAS efforts towards the \r\nrestoration of the Aristide government. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Kino. Barbados) \r\nBarbados is greatly encouraged by the decision reached by the De Klerk \r\nGovernment and by Mr. Mandela on 26 September 1992 to resume negotiations with \r\na view to establishing an interim government and a constituent assembly in \r\nSouth Africa. The release of 150 political prisoners and the promise by the \r\nSouth African Government to release the remaining political prisoners by 15 \r\nNovember 1992 represent a significant development that satisfies an important \r\ncondition of the United Nations Declaration on southern Africa. \r\nBarbados deplores the violence that has been a major obstacle to reform \r\nin South Africa, and holds the De Klerk Government fully responsible for \r\nfailing to curb it. The role of the United Nations remains critical to reform \r\nefforts in South Africa. We therefore welcome the deployment of 50 United \r\nNations observers in South Africa to assist with the implementation of the \r\nNational Peace Accord, and hope that the size of this contingent will be \r\nincreased, if necessary. We urge all the parties to collaborate in \r\nmaintaining an environment free of violence and to participate in peaceful \r\nnegotiations aimed at achieving a non-racial, democratic South Africa. \r\nWe are also encouraged by the current dialogue in the Middle East. We \r\nhope that all parties will make every effort to achieve a just and lasting \r\npeace. \r\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), \r\nwhich took place in Rio de Janeiro in June this year, was perhaps the most \r\nambitious and far-reaching United Nations-sponsored gathering ever held. It \r\nserved a vital purpose in focusing world attention on the interrelationship \r\nbetween human development and the environment, and in fostering global \r\nawareness of the importance of the concept of sustainable development to the \r\nfuture survival of our planet and all its inhabitants. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n54-55 \r\n(Mr. Kino. Barbados) \r\nBarbados cannot pretend to be fully satisfied with the results of the Rio \r\nConference. It was, however, an important beginning in the process towards an \r\ninternational blueprint for sustainable development in the twenty-first \r\ncentury. The creation of a high-level sustainable development commission is \r\nan important element in providing serious follow-up to the decisions of \r\nAgenda 21. Care must be taken to ensure the widest possible access to, and \r\nparticipation in, the work of the Commission by the full membership of the \r\nUnited Nations. Barbados has signed the Conventions on Climate Change and on \r\nBiological Diversity, and is taking the necessary steps at the domestic level \r\nto ensure their early ratification. We reiterate, however, that there is an \r\nurgent need to begin work on a protocol to the Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange that specifically addresses stabilization and reduction of carbon \r\ndioxide and other greenhouse gases. \r\nMy country is heartened that one of the significant achievements at UNCED \r\nwas the recognition given to the special environmental and development needs \r\nof small island developing States, leading to the inclusion in Agenda 21 of a \r\nspecific plan of action for the sustainable development of small island \r\ndeveloping States. In this regard, my delegation wishes to place on record \r\nits deep appreciation of the sterling efforts of the Alliance of Small Island \r\nStates (AOSIS), whose contribution to the success of the Conference cannot be \r\noverstated. As part of the plan to identify and address the special needs of \r\nthis category of States, a global conference will be convened in 1993. \r\nBarbados is honoured to reiterate its offer to host that Conference. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n56 \r\n(Mr. King. Barbados) \r\nThe vulnerability of our environment and the fragility of our marine \r\necosystems require constant vigilance to guard against deliberate or \r\naccidental degradation. In this connection, we echo the concerns of the Prime \r\nMinister of Saint Kitts and Nevis about the possible passage through our \r\nregion of plutonium or other hazardous material. \r\nThe opportunities provided for shaping a truly harmonious new world order \r\nare enormous. The danger of failure is, however, equally great, unless the \r\nredefinition of our future takes place with equal participation by all the \r\nmembers of the global family. Never before has the power of the few over the \r\ndestinies of the many been so apparent, and never before has it been so vital \r\nto the survival of the majority of small and powerless States that make up the \r\nUnited Nations for that power to be used responsibly. \r\nMrâ¢ TURNOUEST (Bahamas): I congratulate Mr. Ganev on his unanimous \r\nelection to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General \r\nAssembly. We are certain that his diplomatic skills and considerable \r\nexperience will lead us to historic conclusions. \r\nI also wish to pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Samir S. Shihabi, \r\nPermanent Representative of Saudi Arabia, for the excellent manner in which he \r\npresided over the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. \r\nIn his short time in office our Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has inspired our confidence that he has the \r\nqualities essential to perform the duties of chief executive of the United \r\nNations. I take this opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment to \r\nthis high office last year. I assure him of the continued cooperation of the \r\nCommonwealth of the Bahamas during this session of the General Assembly, as he \r\nleads a United Nations challenged to reaffirm its fundamental purposes and \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Turnquest. Bahamas) \r\nprinciples, and obliged to redefine its role and function in this world of \r\nunprecedented change. \r\nThe Bahamas warmly welcomes those States that have joined the United \r\nNations since our last session of the General Assembly. \r\nIn just six days on 12 October we who live in the Western Hemisphere \r\nwill mark the five-hundredth anniversary of the encounter between the old \r\nworld and the new, which comes at a most pivotal time in modern history. It \r\nall began on one of the many islands of the Bahamas, now called San Salvador, \r\nand we are pleased to mark this historic occasion. \r\nOn a number of occasions during that 500-year interval these worlds \r\nreferred to as East and West have encountered each other in angry and even \r\nbloody disagreement, and sometimes those disagreements have resulted in a cold \r\nseparation of peoples, countries and cultures. \r\nThe quincentennial presents an opportunity and an invitation to East and \r\nWest to re-enact that initial encounter in a way that is relative and \r\nmeaningful to the nations and the cultures of the twentieth and the \r\ntwenty-first centuries for mutual benefit and for global preservation. \r\nThe present-day inhabitants of the Bahamas, like those of 1492, are a \r\npeace-loving and hospitable people. Small though we are in population, we \r\nfirmly believe in the significance of the role we can play in achieving the \r\npeaceful coexistence of nations and environmental preservation. In that \r\nbelief, I extend a warm and cordial invitation to all the nations represented \r\nhere to come and see and experience the peace and tranguillity of the country \r\nwhere that encounter took place 500 years ago. \r\nToday I address the Assembly on behalf of the Government and the people \r\nof the Commonwealth of the Bahamas to reaffirm our commitment to the \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr. Turnouest. Bahamas) \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to pledge my \r\nGovernment\u0027s cooperation as we seek to ensure that our Organization maintains \r\nits objectives and enhances its effectiveness in international affairs. \r\nThe winds of political change, stirred by the innate desire of the \r\nelectorate for democratic representation and the concomitant responsibility of \r\nthose elected, did not bypass the Bahamas. The Bahamian people once again \r\ndemonstrated their long tradition of, and unswerving commitment to, the \r\ndemocratic process when in the most dramatic yet tranquil manner, in the words \r\nof Aldous Huxley, a \"brave new world\" was ushered into the lives of Bahamians, \r\nand a new administration, the Government of the Free National Movement (FNM), \r\nwas democratically elected only seven weeks ago, on 19 August. That signal \r\nevent heralded a new era in Bahamian history. It is a reinvigorated Bahamas \r\nthat is now poised to take its place in this emerging new political arena. \r\nOur vision is of a world free of tension, thus enabling us to deliver to \r\nour people a new kind of freedom and social and economic justice. \r\nThis year natural disasters have occurred worldwide, exacting high tolls \r\non human life and the destruction of property and natural resources. \r\nJust recently the Bahamas endured the ravages of Hurricane Andrew, which \r\ncaused severe damage $250 million-worth to several islands of the Bahamas, \r\nresulting in a tragic loss of life and leaving more than 1,200 persons \r\nhomeless. \r\nI wish on behalf of my Government to thank all those countries and \r\ninternational organizations, as well as many, many individual friends, for \r\ncoming to the aid of the Bahamas as we begin the task of reconstruction. At \r\nthe same time, we extend our sympathy to the Governments and people of the \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n59-60 \r\n(Mr. Turnquest, Bahamas) \r\nUnited States of America, China, Nicaragua and Pakistan for the devastation \r\nand loss of life inflicted upon their countries by recent natural disasters. \r\nAll our countries face potential natural hazards. But natural hazards, \r\nno matter how great, need not result in natural disasters. We often spend too \r\nmuch time and money recovering from disasters and too little on prevention. \r\nWidespread upheavals and conflicts, within States and between States, \r\nhave been responsible for the mass movement of persons from one country to the \r\nother. This phenomenon not only threatens the security and stability of the \r\naffected countries, but also creates competing demands for attention and vital \r\nresources. This Organization must not be perceived as selective in mediating \r\nproblems of a political nature, nor as elevating the suffering of one group of \r\npeople over that of another. \r\nIn our region, the critical situation in Haiti demands urgent \r\ninternational attention. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n61 \r\n(Mr. Turnquest. Bahamas) \r\nAlmost two years ago, the people of Haiti spoke for democracy. But the \r\nunconstitutional seizure of power by the military has subverted the popular \r\nwill. The great expectations which the world had for Haiti under a \r\ndemocratically elected Government were dashed. Political unrest, economic \r\ndeprivation and poverty have caused a mass exodus of its people, who are \r\nfleeing their homeland in unprecedented numbers and thereby placing an \r\nunacceptably high burden on neighbouring countries, particularly the Bahamas. \r\nI now make a plea for the people of Haiti. We call on the international \r\ncommunity to come to the aid of Haiti. \r\nIt must be appreciated that no matter how grave our disillusionments over \r\nthe plight of the Haitian people, no matter how solicitous our efforts to \r\nunderstand and to help, and no matter how expansive our Christian charity in \r\nthis whole unfortunate affair, the Bahamas has a priority responsibility for \r\nthe welfare of the Bahamian people. \r\nIn the comprehensive Manifesto on which the Governing Party in the \r\nBahamas was swept into power in August this year, we reaffirmed our commitment \r\nto that priority, and it is necessary that our sister nations in this \r\nOrganization fully understand the Bahamas\u0027 position on the matter. \r\nFor almost three decades the Bahamas has been subjected to this serious \r\nproblem of illegal Haitian immigration. The presence of large numbers of \r\nillegal immigrants in the Bahamas has created unexpected demands on the \r\ncountry\u0027s economic, health and welfare agencies. This situation cannot \r\ncontinue, and the Bahamas :an no longer afford to be penalized by the \r\nsituation simply because of our geographical position. \r\nThe Bahamas supports the efforts of the Organization of American States \r\n(OAS) to negotiate a settlement to the situation in Haiti. Fully appreciative \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Turnquest. Bahamas) \r\nof the practical limits to action by the OAS, the Bahamas advocates and \r\nsupports United Nations efforts aimed at strengthening OAS initiatives and \r\nfinding a solution to this problem. \r\nThe Bahamas wishes to place on record its deep appreciation for the \r\ncontinuing assistance which the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees has rendered to us in the difficulties caused us by this \r\nproblem. We implore all concerned to continue to pursue all peaceful means to \r\nreach a comprehensive settlement of the Haitian situation. \r\nI should also like to decry the problems of drug abuse, drug trafficking \r\nand the illicit production of drugs, which continue to haunt the international \r\ncommunity with their catastrophic effects on our individual societies. \r\nThe creation of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme \r\nhas been our most recent collective step to strengthen, improve and \r\nrationalize the legal and institutional framework for control of the \r\nproduction, trafficking and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic \r\nsubstances. My Government wishes to affirm its support for the Programme and \r\nits efforts in providing valuable assistance to countries fighting this menace. \r\nHowever, a most significant element in the fight against the drug trade \r\nis the requisite cooperation between States. My Government pledges to \r\ncontinue its collaboration with our neighbours to fight against the drug \r\nmenace. In this regard, we wish to thank the Governments of the United States \r\nof America and Canada for the assistance they have rendered to the Bahamas. \r\nThe world breathed a sigh of relief earlier this year when it appeared \r\nthat talks between the Government of South Africa and the African National \r\nCongress gave promise of establishing a political solution to the problems of \r\nSouth Africa. The Bahamas deeply regrets that the process of dialogue has \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. Turnquest. Bahamas) \r\nbeen interrupted. We condemn the massacre at Boipatong and other massacres of \r\ninnocent civilians, as we equally condemn the efforts by the South African \r\nGovernment to delay the realization of majority rule in South Africa. \r\nThe United Nations has been a critical force in opposing the abhorrent \r\nsystem of apartheid in South Africa and in moving that country towards a \r\nnon-racial, unitary and democratic society. The role of the United Nations is \r\neven more critical since the lifting of sanctions by many influential States. \r\nThe United Nations must not fail the people of South Africa at this critical \r\nmoment. My country strongly supports the phased lifting of sanctions agreed \r\nby States members of the Commonwealth, and it firmly supports the effort that \r\nthe United Nations is making to encourage the resumption of negotiations \r\ntowards a new constitution for South Africa and ending the violence which \r\nthreatens a total disruption of these negotiations. \r\nThe Earth Summit held in Rio in June of this year was a historic \r\nbeginning. The fact that wore than 118 world leaders attended is a measure of \r\nthe seriousness with which the global community is viewing the question of the \r\nenvironment. \r\nIt is perhaps a trite truism to observe that the survival of the human \r\nfamily depends to a great extent on how this generation protects the natural \r\nenvironment. The positive results achieved by the Summit were due in large \r\nmeasure to the cooperation fostered by the United Nations. Real success, \r\nhowever, will be judged by the abilities of countries to carry out programmes \r\nat the national level. Tins can come about only when national capacities are \r\nstrengthened and additional resources are available. We must therefore \r\ncontinue to maintain the vision and basic principles of multilateral \r\ncooperation. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n64-65 \r\n(Mr. Turnquest. Bahamas) \r\nThe Bahamas therefore welcomes the decision to establish a United Nations \r\ncommission on sustainable development to monitor the follow-up action after \r\nRio. The Bahamas, an archipelagic State of pristine aquamarine water, with a \r\nvibrant tourist industry, is committed to the protection of its own natural \r\nenvironment as well as the promotion of the global environment. My Government \r\nsees eco-tourism as a powerful instrument for sustainable development of the \r\nBahamas, and we are fully committed to protection of the environment. The \r\nBahamas therefore gives its assurance that it will scrupulously abide by the \r\nconventions signed at Rio, and its commitment to sustainable development \r\nremains absolute. \r\nThe World Economic Survey of 1992 indicates that world output has \r\ndeclined for the first time since the Second World War. World trade has \r\nexperienced slow growth. Countries continue to wrestle with economic \r\nrecession and the decline in world financial markets. Failure to complete the \r\nUruguay Round of negotiations will undoubtedly lead to increased \r\nprotectionism. These are areas of concern to us all, as are the uncertainties \r\nprevailing in world markets with regard to the future course of interest \r\nrates. These introduce many constraints on investment capital flows and \r\nconsequently on the growth of developing countries in particular. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n66 \r\n(Mr. Turnquest. Bahamas) \r\nIn spite of all these problems and uncertainties, the performance of the \r\nworld economy can be improved through the enhancement of international \r\ncooperation and policy coordination, which must now be a principal objective \r\nof the United Nations. \r\nThe United Nations has become the centre of a diplomatic revolution, one \r\nthat mirrors the revitalization of national political institutions in many \r\ncountries. Fundamental changes not only promise greater personal freedom and \r\nmore dynamic societies, but frequently provide new challenges which create \r\nuncertainty in international relations. The United Nations will have to adopt \r\na new strategy for addressing these challenges. \r\nToday, we live in a world of much lowered ideological tension, a world in \r\nwhich representative democracy is of fundamental importance. Indeed, the \r\nrenewal in many parts of the world of the democratic process implies greater \r\nrespect for human rights. In that regard, the United Nations must play a \r\ncatalytic role in ensuring that human rights are assured. \r\nWe have also come better to understand the relationship between respect \r\nfor human rights and our search for economic and social development, and we \r\nmust measure that development by actual improvements in human lives and not \r\nexclusively in monetary terms. \r\nWe are hopeful that the greatly changed international environment and the \r\nrenewal of interest worldwide in human rights will contribute to the success \r\nof the World Conference on Human Rights scheduled for 1993. In this regard my \r\nGovernment has undertaken to give early consideration to all of the human \r\nrights conventions to which the Bahamas is not yet a party, including the \r\nCovenants relating to economic, social and political rights. \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n67 \r\n(Mr. Turnquest. Bahamas) \r\nThe pace of change in international politics is straining mankind\u0027s \r\ncapabilities of assimilation and assessment. In Western Europe the outlines of \r\nsupernationalism have become visible. In Central Europe the echoes of history \r\nare heralded again after more than 40 years of silence. And in Eastern Europe \r\ncommunism is in full-scale retreat under the implacable pressure of the \r\nrecognition of its limitations and of rising expectations. In Asia countries \r\nthat could scarcely feed themselves a generation ago have become tigers of \r\neconomic competition. Meantime, the spectre of famine remains over the Horn \r\nof Africa, demonstrating that not all change is positive. Almost everywhere \r\npluralistic democratic values are surfacing and tending to dominate. \r\nIn a world of tinder, fire-breaks are needed. The United Nations \r\npeace-keeping operations can be considered just such fire-breaks. The support \r\nof the international community, both political and material, remains an \r\nessential characteristic of peace-keeping operations, regardless of their \r\nsize. Political support by Governments can mean the difference between a \r\nparty\u0027s compliance with the terms of an agreement and serious infractions that \r\njeopardize lives and progress towards peace. \r\nThe price of United Nations peace-keeping is, by monetary standards, a \r\nbargain. But the United Nations is more than just good value. The \r\ncontributions of the membership are certainly a more cost-effective and humane \r\nsolution to international disputes than the conflict and human suffering that \r\noccur when States feel that they are unable, or are unwilling, to use the \r\nmachinery offered by the United Nations and resort to war. \r\nWe welcome the recent pronouncements of the Presidents of the \r\nUnited States of America and of the Russian Federation of 17 June 1992 to \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n68 \r\n(Mr. Turnquest. Bahamas) \r\nreduce their nuclear arsenals below the numbers agreed to last summer during \r\nthe Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty Talks (START) and their joint statement on \r\nchemical weapons in which they reiterated their commitment to the global \r\nelimination of such weapons. The recently concluded negotiations on a \r\nconvention banning chemical weapons is a further important step forward in \r\ncurtailing the use of weapons of mass destruction. Further progress in this \r\narea will be determined by the political will of Member States, their \r\ncommitment to their obligations under existing disarmament agreements, and the \r\nmore recent agreements, such as the United Nations universal and \r\nnon-discriminatory Register of Conventional Arms, which became operational on \r\n1 January 1992. The Bahamas remains totally committed to general and complete \r\ndisarmament. \r\nThe bedrock for action by the United Nations lies in States adhering to, \r\nand consistently applying, the principles of the Charter. It costs money to \r\nput principles into practice. Expanded responsibilities translate into greater \r\ncosts, which must be borne by the States Members of the Organization. \r\nIn the coming decade it is vital to use in the most effective and \r\nefficient manner this Organization, which has demonstrated the importance of \r\nits promotional and catalytic role, particularly in bringing to the surface \r\nissues which are likely to assume importance in coming years. \r\nThe creation of a stable and more favourable international environment is \r\nfundamental to the strengthening of multilateral policy coordination within an \r\nenhanced framework, especially if we are to realize our new vision for an \r\nimproved new world order. This requires the collective resolve of the giant \r\nnations as well as of tiny nations, such as the Bahamas, to work together to \r\nA/47/PV.27 \r\n69 \r\n(Mr. Turnquest. Bahamas) \r\nremove constraints and to allow for optimum growth and development. The new \r\nworld order can be lasting only if all constituent elements grow in harmony. \r\nA multilateral, concerted and comprehensive approach is vital for the \r\nimplementation of effective and lasting solutions to global problems. \r\nAs I noted at the outset, this year\u0027s commemoration of the quincentennial \r\nin the Bahamas and in the \"/estern hemisphere offers a unique opportunity to \r\nmake real and meaningful and mutually beneficial that original encounter of \r\nthe old and new worlds. There are those who condemn that encounter but \r\nColumbus did come and as a result a medley of old and new cultures and \r\ncivilizations emerged. \r\nIt was fitting that with the coming into being of the United Nations in \r\nSan Francisco in 1945 the Preamble to our Charter reaffirmed our determination \r\nto save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and our faith in \r\nfundamental human rights, and established conditions under which justice and \r\nrespect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of \r\ninternational law should be maintained. \r\nIn those 47 years, many swords have been beaten into plowshares, and many \r\nspears into pruning hooks. It is now left for us to make abidingly true the \r\nend of that refrain, that nation shall not lift up sword against nation, \r\nneither shall we learn war any more. \r\nThe meeting rose at 5.30 p.m. \r\n"
