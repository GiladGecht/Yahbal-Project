Your unanimous \r\nelection is testimony to the high regard the international community has for \r\nyour country and the Assembly\u0027s confidence that your leadership will provide \r\nthe necessary direction on many important issues that we shall take up during \r\nthis session. \r\nI should like to take this opportunity to place on record our deep \r\nappreciation to Mr. Samir S. Shihabi, for the excellent manner in which he \r\nconducted the proceedings of our last session. \r\nI wish to extend our warm welcome to the Governments and peoples of all \r\nthe new Members of \" ° United Nations. The large number of new Members is \r\ntestimony not only to t\u0027 3 historic changes that are taking place in the world, \r\nbut also to the universality and importance of the United Nations. We welcome \r\nthem and look forward to the opportunity to work together. \r\nDuring the last three years the world has witnessed the disappearance of \r\nthe ideological conflict that had divided it and pervaded every aspect of \r\nsocial and economic life for much of this century. While these sweeping \r\nchanges have brought new opportunities for peace, stability and progress, \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n3 \r\n(Mr. Tshering, Bhutan) \r\nhopes have been dampened on the one hand by the unleashing of old hostilities \r\nand new conflicts, and on the other by the further impoverishment of millions \r\nof people for whom the changes in the international scene have little \r\nmeaning. The social and economic situation remains dismal not only in many \r\ndeveloping countries but also in many developed countries which are suffering \r\nfrom a prolonged recession. Though the opportunity for peace and progress has \r\nnever been better, the challenges of inequity and poverty, which are the main \r\nreasons for instability and conflict, continue to be daunting as ever. \r\nIn many ways the United Nations has been the greatest beneficiary of the \r\nchanges in international affairs. After many years of blatant disregard and \r\neven disrespect by many and a lack of confidence in its abilities by others, \r\nthe international community is now increasingly turning to the United \r\nNations. There is greater willingness on the part of everybody to work \r\nthrough the Organization. \r\nIn this context we should like to record our appreciation to our previous \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, for having created this opportunity \r\nand increased respect for the United Nations. We should also like to express \r\nour admiration and appreciation to our present Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for taking immediate steps to make the Organization \r\nrelevant and more responsive to the needs of the world, particularly in the \r\narea of conflict. We share his views on the need for immediate peace-keeping \r\nand peace-making and for greater emphasis on conflict resolution. Above all, \r\nwe share his view on the need to give equal importance and attention to \r\nconflict and suffering wherever they may be in the world. \r\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to be a major concern for \r\nglobal peace. While the unnecessary and senseless aggression against the \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n4 \r\n(Mr. Tshering, Bhutan) \r\npeaceful people of Kuwait has been reversed, the issue of prisoners and \r\ndisarmament remains. This new confrontation has added another dimension to \r\nthe region, where peace and stability have already been denied for a long time. \r\nWe fully appreciate the efforts of the sponsors of the dialogue that is \r\ntaking place on the Middle East. We sincerely hope that the talks will defuse \r\nthe conflict and pave the way for peace in the region. However, this process \r\nwill not be successful unless the question of Palestine and occupied Arab \r\nlands is addressed and the legitimate rights of the Palestinians to \r\nself-determination in their homeland are guaranteed. Equally, the territorial \r\nintegrity of Lebanon and the security and safety of all States in the region, \r\nincluding Israel, must be assured. Only then will there be meaningful peace \r\nin the region. \r\nIn South Africa, while there has been progress towards change, the \r\nprocess has been continuously marred by a heavy toll in human lives. The \r\nviolence must stop and the talks should continue. The inevitable course of \r\nchange should not be restrained any further. \r\nWhile the cold war has ended, one of its last remnants still stands in \r\nthe division of the Korean peninsula. We welcome the recent exchanges between \r\nthe two countries and believe they will eventually lead to unification. We \r\nfully support the pragmatic steps set forth by President Roh Tae Woo of the \r\nRepublic of Korea in his address to this session and share his vision of the \r\nKorean peninsula presenting itself as one nation before this body in the near \r\nfuture. \r\nThe supply of arms over the years has made it possible for conflicts in \r\nSomalia and other regions of the world to continue despite the major changes \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n5 \r\n(Mr. Tshering. Bhutan) \r\nin the international scene. The results have been tragic, and we cannot but \r\nemphasize the immediate need for humanitarian assistance and for resolution of \r\nthe problems. \r\nThe disappearance of the bipolar world has provided the best opportunity \r\nfor ending the arms race and bringing about complete disarmament. The chance \r\nto direct all efforts and resources from the production of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction towards the service of humanity must not be allowed to slip by. \r\nWhile there has been reduction of major weapons, the production and supply of \r\nsmaller arms have continued to thrive in many parts of the world. Developing \r\ncountries can ill afford to spend their resources on such unproductive and \r\ndestructive enterprises. \r\nThe tragedies of war and conflict are not the only factors contributing \r\nto human suffering. While they may be dramatic and reguire immediate \r\nattention, more suffering is taking place on a day-to-day basis, involving \r\nmillions of people in the world. Just as it is important to end conflict, it \r\nis essential that the problems of poverty be addressed. \r\nThe decade of the 1980s produced few, if any, positive results in the \r\nfield of socio-economic development; consequently, the living conditions of \r\nonly a few are better than when the decade started. The International \r\nDevelopment Strategy for the 1990s, adopted by the General Assembly at its \r\neighteenth special session; the Cartagena Commitments agreed to at the Eighth \r\nConference of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development \r\n(UNCTAD VIII); the Rio Declaration of the Earth Summit; and the Jakarta \r\nMessage of the Tenth Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement all call \r\nfor renewed efforts in international development in the decade ahead. \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n6 \r\n(Mr. Tshering. Bhutan) \r\nOn the otherwise discouraging sceme there have been two important \r\nevents: the World Summit for Children, in September 1990, and the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in \r\nRio de Janeiro in June this year. The children\u0027s Summit clearly drew our \r\nattention to the need to redouble our efforts to give our children the \r\nnecessary care, attention and education if we are to ensure a better future \r\nfor humanity. \r\nThe Earth Summit clearly established the common stake we all have in the \r\nwell being of the planet. It recognized that, while the responsibility for \r\npreserving the delicate ecological balance falls on all nations, at the same \r\ntime those responsible for its degradation and abuse must be held \r\naccountable. Our planet can no longer sustain a high level of exploitation, \r\nand there must be a willingness on the part of those placing a high demand on \r\nnatural resources to reduce consumption. At the same time more resources are \r\nnecessary to improve the conditions and meet the basic needs of billions of \r\npeople in developing countries, particularly the more than 1.1 billion people \r\nwho live in absolute poverty. As further misuse of the earth\u0027s finite \r\nresources would be disastrous, the only alternative is a greater willingness \r\nto share. \r\nThe high pace of population growth and the resulting increase in demand \r\non resources is a serious threat to the environment and to the future. \r\nDeveloping countries, where 4.3 billion of today\u0027s population of 5.5 billion \r\nlive, and where nearly all the next billions will be added in the decades \r\nahead, must take all measures to ensure that population and development are \r\nbalanced in a sustainable manner. \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n7 \r\n(Mr. Tshering. Bhutan) \r\nThe next three to four decades will be the most challanging humanity has \r\never faced, as they will determine the long-term survival of our planet. Just \r\nas we have a common stake in the environment and social well being, our \r\nfutures are also tied in terms of overall global economic health. The slow \r\nrecovery in the North from a long protracted recession has affected all \r\ncountries. Similarly, the economic strength of developing countries clearly \r\naffects economic opportunities for the North. \r\nThe long established target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for \r\nofficial development assistance has not been reached by most donor countries \r\nand is not likely to be during this century. Official development assistance, \r\nwhether through bilateral or through multilateral channels, has been set back \r\nnot only in terms of slow growth but also in terms of slow disbursement \r\nresulting from increasing modalities and conditionalities. \r\nThe question of debt still awaits comprehensive solution after more than \r\na decade of discussion. Both the need for debt relief and the requirement of \r\nadditional credit must be dealt with in a fair and comprehensive manner. The \r\nserious imbalances in international trade in terms of prices for commodities \r\nas well as volume of trade must be made more stable. Trade is one of the few \r\navenues available to developing countries for progress, and must not be \r\nrestricted. It is also necessary that access to knowledge and technology be \r\nmade easier. \r\nOur discussions on development and political change must take into \r\naccount the human and social dimensions. There is increasing social tension \r\nand disregard for human dignity arising out of poverty, high population growth \r\nand resulting unemployment, migration and competition for scarce resources. \r\nThe wholesome well being of individuals and their rights can be assured if \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n8 \r\n(Mr. Tshering. Bhutan! \r\nthere are stable social, economic, political and natural environments. We \r\nlook forward to the Second World Conference on Human Rights, in 1993, and the \r\nproposed world summit for social development to address these important issues \r\nin an integrated manner. \r\nIn my own country, Bhutan, development activities started only in the \r\n1960s. Since then, major changes have taken place: an effective fiscal and \r\nfinancial management system, a basic network of social services, roads \r\nconnecting all population centres, and a growing export sector comprised of \r\nenergy, minerals and agricultural products have been established. The \r\ndevelopment of human resources and the preservation of our rich environment \r\nhave been given special attention. Despite the considerable progress, our \r\neconomic infrastructure remains inadeguate, and the country\u0027s communications \r\nand transport systems require expansion. In addition to the problems all \r\nleast developed countries face, Bhutan is further handicapped by being \r\nlandlocked. \r\nBhutan has always taken full responsibility for its own development, and \r\nwe will continue to do so, but the progress we have made thus far would not \r\nhave been possible without generous support, particularly that of India, \r\nJapan, Switzerland, Denmark, Kuwait, Austria, Norway, the Netherlands, \r\nGermany, the United Kingdom and Australia and various agencies and bodies of \r\nthe United Nations, in particular the United Nations Development Programme, \r\nthe United Nations Children\u0027s Fund, the International Fund for Agricultural \r\nDevelopment, the United Nations Capital Development Fund, the World Health \r\nOrganization, the World Food Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization \r\nof the United Nations, the United Nations Volunteers, the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund, the United Nations Department of Technical Cooperation for \r\nDevelopment and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n9 \r\n(Mr. Tshering. Bhutan) \r\nOrganization. I take this opportunity to express the sincere gratitude and \r\nappreciation of the people and Government of the Kingdom of Bhutan to our \r\ndevelopment partners. \r\nOne of the important issues before the Assembly is the establishment of \r\nthe Commission on Sustainable Development. We fully welcome such a \r\ncommission, but we must emphasize that its mandate and relationship to \r\nexisting organizations must be very clear, and its task must contribute \r\ntangibly and substantively to socio-economic development. Let it not be one \r\nof the multitude of international organizations struggling to bring about \r\ndevelopment. \r\nThe strengthening, revitalization and reorganization of the United \r\nNations must extend to all its organs and organizations. In this context we \r\nwelcome the concrete steps that our Secretary-General has taken in \r\nstreamlining the Secretariat. The United Nations is finally being geared to \r\nundertake its peace-keeping, peace-making and humanitarian relief work \r\neffectively. We urge that a similar effort be made to ensure that the \r\nmultitude of organs and agencies involved in development be streamlined and \r\nrevitalized with the same vigour. \r\nWe have listened carefully to the various views on reforming and \r\ndemocratizing the United Nations. This is an extremely important matter that \r\nmust take into account the significant historical changes and the current \r\nmembership of the international body. There is need for a new enlightened \r\nbalance among the principal organs of the United Nations. The General \r\nAssembly must be provided with more responsibility, and the International \r\nCourt of Justice with more authority. \r\nFinally, the United Nations is no longer the hostage of ideological \r\nconflict and now has new found respect and confidence. While this opportunity \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n10 \r\n(Mr. Tshering. Bhutan) \r\nmust not be missed, the path ahead is a long one, and the United Nations must \r\nmove guickly to make itself relevant and capable of meeting the \r\nresponsibilities it has long not been permitted to carry out. But above all \r\nthe United Nations must be fair in fulfilling the aspirations and meeting the \r\nhopes and needs of all its Members, big and small. \r\nMr. PASHOVSKI (Bulgaria) (interpretation from French): \r\nMr. President, at the outset I should like to express our deep thanks to all \r\ndelegations of Member States for the uananimous decision to confer the \r\npresidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly upon us. That \r\ncan be conceived as an application of the rules of procedure, which provide \r\nthat the presidency of the forty-seventh session will be given to a \r\nrepresentative of Eastern Europe. However, I should also like to see it as \r\nsupport knowingly given for all that our people have done to ensure that \r\nBulgaria would remain an example in the difficult transition from dictatorship \r\ntowards normalcy. \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n11 \r\n(Mr. Pashovski. Bulgaria) \r\nI should also like to express my delegation\u0027s gratitude to \r\nAmbassador Samir Shihabi for his valuable contributions to achievements of the \r\nforty-sixth session. \r\nOn behalf of my country I am pleased to welcome the new States Members of \r\nthe United Nations. We hope that other peace-loving States prepared to \r\nimplement the principles of the Organization will make their contributions. \r\nThe Organization\u0027s work has now been going on without interruption, \r\nalbeit with ups and downs, for 47 years. Today, we are happy to be able to \r\nsay that it is entering a new stage. The aggressive communist system that had \r\nset itself the goal of spreading its colour over the entire planet no longer \r\nexists. The peoples under its domination paid dearly for that experiment. \r\nState, economic and social structures are in ruins, and the environment been \r\ndegraded. When we add the new investments needed to divert to satisfying the \r\nreal needs of society the vast military machinery and weapons stockpiles that \r\nwere accumulated we cannot help but exclaim to ourselves: What a waste of \r\nresources! \r\nThe common denominator of communism\u0027s deeds is the wasting of millions of \r\nhuman lives. People have been killed, tortured, mutilated and removed from \r\nactive life. Let us pay tribute to them, for through their suffering history \r\nhas once again demonstrated that although violence may well create empires, it \r\ncannot preserve them. \r\nIn assessing today the United Nations place in human civilization we \r\nrecall that our inheritance from the Roman Empire was not the frontiers \r\nestablished by its legions but Roman law, Roman architecture and Roman \r\nphilosophy all products of the thinking of the people of that era. The same \r\nholds true for the Eastern or colonial empires. Reason alone leaves lasting \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n12 \r\n(Mr. Pashovski. Bulgaria) \r\nfruits. The failure of the badly brought up and poorly educated who have \r\ntried to govern the world has provided further proof of this. \r\nIt is unnecessary to come up with lengthy treatises to understand that \r\nthroughout the succession of different forms of social organization the \r\ninstitutions that last are those that ensure the best opportunities for \r\nthought to emerge, spread, endure and evolve. Thought knows no local or \r\ninternational boundaries. It creates links across space and time. It truly \r\nunites nations. The best way to give a new impetus to the United Nations is \r\nto work to transform it into an Organization of united minds. \r\nOnly the individual can create a thought. Even with the traditional \r\npredominance of the State in society, we must recognize that it is the human \r\nbeing who bears the responsibility for maintaining parliamentary democracy and \r\nthe effective production of goods. The protection of the human rights of each \r\nhuman being must be the fundamental condition for accepting any State into the \r\nUnited Nations family. Today, as we assess the 47 years that have gone by and \r\nseek new directions, we see that compromise in this area is very costly and \r\nthe price is not paid only by those in the Gulag Archipelago; it is paid by \r\neveryone. \r\nWe know that totalitarian regimes provoke domestic and international \r\ncrises and that their authoritarian decisions threaten nature and sometimes \r\neven mankind\u0027s survival. \r\nI should like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who submitted his report, \"An Agenda for Peace,\" at \r\na time when a new atmosphere prevails within the United Nations. The \r\nBulgarian delegation warmly welcomes his message, which is designed to guide \r\nthe Organization towards efficiency and concrete results. It goes \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n13 \r\n(Mr. Pashovski. Bulgaria) \r\nwithout saying that the fundamental condition for the reform proposed by the \r\nSecretary-General is the bridging of the gap between the declarations of \r\nStates and their true policies. \r\nThe Bulgarian delegation supports the principal ideas in \"An Agenda for \r\nPeace\" and welcomes the fact that a \"constructive discussion on that basis has \r\nbeen initiated at the present session. We consider it would be useful to \r\ncreate a special working group to accelerate the evaluation of comments and \r\nproposals submitted by Member States. \r\nFor the Bulgarian delegation the link between international peace, \r\ndevelopment and respect for human rights is basic. That link exists in the \r\nCharter, and it was emphasized at the Security Council Summit Meeting on \r\n31 January 1992. We should have it constantly in our minds when discussing \r\nideas of preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and peacemaking. \r\nPreventive diplomacy is a necessity, and the Secretary-General must be \r\nsupported in his efforts to develop that concept and give it practical \r\ndimensions. In this connection there is a whole range of activities that \r\nmight be considered, such as: information-gathering on problems that may \r\nprovoke conflicts; the establishment of contacts with forces that may become \r\ninvolved in conflict; the dispatch of fact-finding or other missions, both \r\nlong-term and short-term; the sending of special representatives; the \r\ndeployment of civilian or military observers; and, lastly, the deployment of \r\nmilitary troops should the need arise. \r\nUnited Nations efforts in the realm of preventive diplomacy, \r\ncrisis-management and post-conflict peace-building must also include a greater \r\nand more effective cooperation with regional organizations. We support the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s idea of making better use of the potential of regional \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n14 \r\n(Mr. Pashovski. Bulgaria) \r\norganizations. In our view this entails creating a system to coordinate the \r\nefforts of agencies working at both the global and regional levels. As of \r\nnow, there could be such coordination with regard to the sending of \r\nfact-finding missions or special rapporteurs, or to similar measures. We \r\nbelieve that interesting ideas may emerge from a discussion of the \r\nopportunities available to the United Nations to delegate certain functions to \r\nregional organizations as provided in Chapter VIII of the Charter. At the \r\nsame time, we must not forget that the supreme responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of peace has been entrusted to the United Nations. \r\nWe consider very useful the experience already acquired through the work \r\nof the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). As an \r\nexample, let us take the establishment of the post of High Commissioner on \r\nNational Minorities, whose tasks could well be considered to come within the \r\nfield of preventive diplomacy, or all the confidence-building measures drafted \r\nin the course of the Helsinki process, including the recently signed \"Open \r\nSkies\" Treaty. Here I might mention a measure proposed by the Bulgarian \r\ndelegation at the Vienna negotiations, and already successfully tried, which \r\nis to invite accredited military attaches to visit zones of tension in the \r\ncountry where they are posted. With necessary adjustments, when feasible, \r\nmany of these measures could acguire universal status. \r\nWe feel that the reverse process could also be employed. The notion of \r\ncreating a universal register of conventional arms could also be implemented \r\nat the regional level to prevent quantities of conventional weapons capable of \r\ndestabilizing a region from being stockpiled without any preventive control. \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n15 \r\n(Mr. Pashovski. Bulgaria) \r\nRegional registers would not only ensure increased transparency, but would \r\nalso assist in the creation and functioning of a world register. Bulgaria \r\nreaffirms its commitment to the implementation of resolution 46/36 L, \r\n\"Transparency in armaments.\" \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n16 \r\n(Mr. Pashovski. Bulgaria) \r\nThe reform of the United Nations cannot take place without strengthening \r\nconfidence among States. Continuation of the disarmament process is \r\nabsolutely necessary if the new climate in the world is to be maintained. We \r\npay a tribute to Presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin for having taken \r\ncourageous steps to reduce offensive nuclear weapons and to diminish the risk \r\nof a nuclear holocaust. We hope that they will continue their efforts and \r\ncarry this process to its completion. \r\nEncouraged by the success achieved in nuclear disarmament and knowing \r\nthat regional conflicts are still raging, we feel that it is time to take a \r\ndecisive step to resolve the problem of the non-proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction. As a State party to the non-proliferation Treaty, Bulgaria \r\nknows its value and supports the efforts to make it universal. We are in \r\nfavour of having it continue in force indefinitely after 1995. \r\nWe participated in the drafting of the Convention on chemical weapons \r\nwhich we expect to see adopted at this session. From this lofty rostrum I \r\nshould like to confirm Bulgaria\u0027s will to be among the first countries to sign \r\nthe Convention and to work for its entry into force as quickly as possible. \r\nIn putting forth efforts to prevent world war, we must not forget that \r\nregional wars are raging. Whether we speak about Iraq, Somalia, on Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, the malady is universal, even if solutions can only be individual. \r\nSince the beginning of the Yugoslav crisis, Bulgaria has adopted a \r\nposition aimed at preventing the conflict from spreading and at cooperating \r\nwith the international community in efforts to find a political solution to \r\nthe conflict. We participated in the London Conference, which stimulated \r\ninternational efforts by launching a process of negotiations under the \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n17 \r\n(Mr. Pashovski. Bulgaria) \r\nauspices of the United Nations and the European Community. Bulgaria firmly \r\nsupports the principles drafted by the Conference because we feel that they \r\nare the basis for a lasting and comprehensive solution to the conflict. \r\nBulgaria has recognized all of the Republics which, in accordance with \r\nconstitutional procedures, have clearly expressed their desire to become \r\nsovereign States. That makes it possible to bring all the parties of the \r\nformer Federation together round a negotiating table but if one or two of \r\nthem were to be absent, it would be impossible to do so. We have therefore \r\nrecognized the existing international borders, showing clearly that we are not \r\ngetting ready to take advantage of our neighbour\u0027s difficulties for \r\nnationalist purposes. \r\nAt this time it is extremely important to contain the conflict and to \r\nprevent its spread. The Bulgarian Government has decided to continue to work \r\ntogether with the international community in carrying out the decisions of the \r\nLondon Conference and of the Security Council. \r\nAn additional but effective way is to deploy international observer \r\nmissions. Since the end of last year, the Bulgarian Government has declared \r\nseveral times that it was ready to accept such a mission on its territory. We \r\nsupport the decision taken by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope (CSCE) to send missions to the neighbouring countries of Serbia and \r\nMontenegro and we pay a tribute to the mission of the European Community which \r\nis in Bulgaria. \r\nI should like to recall that we invited another special mission of the \r\nEuropean Community and of the CSCE to lend assistance to our authorities in \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n18 \r\n(Mr. Pashovski. Bulgaria) \r\nthe implementation of Security Council resolutions imposing economic sanctions \r\nand the embargo on imports of weapons into the former Yugoslavia. \r\nAnd while we are speaking of sanctions, I should like to draw the \r\nAssembly\u0027s attention to the fact that they also affect the countries which \r\napply them. Whether we talk about the case of Iraq, Libya or the former \r\nYugoslavia, a large number of Bulgarian enterprises have been seriously \r\naffected and our entire economy has suffered serious losses. If we wish to \r\npunish only the guilty party, it would be only fair to consider setting up a \r\ncompensation programme for the non-guilty party. \r\nBulgaria will continue its efforts to organize a conference to reaffirm \r\nthe applicability in the Balkans of the principles of the CSCE. The Bulgarian \r\ninitiative for a Balkan forum is a concrete example of the general principles \r\nof the Helsinki Final Act, as applied to the actual conditions in the \r\nBalkans. In this context the setting up and carrying out of a special \r\nprogramme for the economic recovery of the Balkan States, a kind of \"Marshall \r\nPlan\", is of prime importance. \r\nBulgaria is working to establish relations with neighbouring States on a \r\nstable legal basis. We have concluded treaties of friendship, cooperation and \r\ngood-neighbourliness with Greece, Turkey and Romania, and we are now in the \r\nprocess of signing such a treaty with Albania, Slovenia and Croatia. We wish \r\nto live in peace and a state of good-neighbourliness with all the peoples in \r\nour region, including the Serbian and Montenegrin peoples with whom we have \r\nlong historic ties. We hope that, as soon as possible, they will once again \r\nfind their place in this Hall. That would be the best sign that the problems \r\nhave already been resolved. \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n19 \r\n(Mr. Pashovski. Bulgaria) \r\nThe death of thousands of people and the suffering of millions of \r\nothers, especially women, children and the elderly, the huge flows of \r\nrefugees, and the barbaric practice of ethnic cleansing must not be \r\nforgotten. These flagrant violations of humanitarian international law have \r\neloquently shown the overriding need to create an international penal court \r\nwhich would have the competence to judge individuals who commit crimes against \r\npeace and humanity. Perhaps it would be appropriate to analyse the \r\npossibilities of using for these purposes one of the permanent courts already \r\nin existence the International Court of Justice or the European Court of \r\nHuman Rights. In any case, this requires discussion and Bulgaria favours \r\ncontinuing the work of the International Law Commission on drawing up the \r\ndraft statute for such a court. \r\nWe think that after the cold war it is imperative to strengthen the role \r\nof international law in international relations. This is necessary, in our \r\nview, because the bipolar structure of international relations has disappeared \r\nand therefore it is necessary to replace it with clear, precise, legal rules \r\nwhich are also universally recognized. On that basis, we should, in our \r\nopinion, promote above all, the strict implementation of the provisions of the \r\nCharter and strengthen the role of the United Nations in international \r\naffairs. \r\nBulgaria energetically supports all actions and measures which have been \r\nlaid down in the biennial programme for the United Nations Decade of \r\nInternational Law. We are convinced that the most important part of the \r\nprogramme is the part dealing with ways and means to bring about the peaceful \r\nsettlement of international disputes. In this context, I should like to \r\ninform representatives that on 23 June 1992 the Bulgarian Government deposited \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n20 \r\n(Mr. Pashovski. Bulgaria) \r\nwith the Secretary-General a Declaration of Acceptance of the binding \r\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. Furthermore, on that same \r\nday we withdrew our reservations on the jurisdictional provisions of a number \r\nof international conventions, such as the International Convention on the \r\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimation, the International Convention \r\nagainst the Taking of Hostages, and others. I should like to extend the \r\nBulgarian delegation\u0027s support for the recommendation of the Secretary-General \r\ncontained in paragraph 38 of his report \"An Agenda for Peace\", namely that the \r\nGeneral Assembly could, pursuant to Article 96, paragraph 2, of the Charter, \r\nauthorize the Secretary-General to take advantage of the advisory competence \r\nof the International Court of Justice. Such a possibility would considerably \r\nstrengthen the effectiveness of the work of the Secretary- General. \r\nI began my statement with some thoughts about the role of man as the \r\nonly being capable of using reason and of original thought. Honour and \r\ndignity are inherent in each human being, and history shows us that all \r\nconflicts are more or less linked to violations of human rights. Our \r\nOrganization has created very good standards in this field and emphasis must \r\nnow be placed on improving the machinery for monitoring and implementing \r\nexisting standards. \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n21 \r\n(Mr. Pashovski. Bulgaria) \r\nThe crises that have followed the disintegration of multinational \r\nfederations have demonstrated the importance of the problems of ethnic and \r\nreligious minorities within the overall framework of human rights protection. \r\nIn this context, my country is deeply concerned over the fate of the Bulgarian \r\nminority in Serbia. Although it is not directly affected by the war, this \r\npopulation has a justified feeling of insecurity with regard to its future and \r\nidentity, and should not be forgotten by the international community. \r\nDemocratic Bulgaria has succeeded in finding an original and effective \r\napproach to solving these problems. The Bulgarian Turks have their \r\nrepresentatives in the national parliament, and bear their share of the \r\nresponsibility for the future of our country. Ethnic tolerance is a \r\ncharacteristic trait of the Bulgarian people; one of the most telling example \r\nis the way the Jews in Bulgaria were rescued during the Second World War. \r\nThe words \"war\" and \"peace\" have been intermingled in my speech, as they \r\nare, moreover, in real life. But it is clear that peace will win out in the \r\nend, because it is in peace that man shows himself to be reasonable and \r\ncreative. Those who preach peace still remain among us; those who cry \r\nviolence are not. That is why, in Bulgaria, we have said a last farewell to \r\ncommunism and sided with the nations that are united in their way of thinking. \r\nMr. SSEMOGERERE (Uganda): Mr. President, allow me to congratulate \r\nyou most warmly on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits forty-seventh session. I am confident that, given your skills and \r\nexperience, you will successfully guide our deliberations. I wish also to pay \r\na well-deserved tribute to your predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi of the \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n22 \r\n(Mr. Ssemogerere. Uganda) \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, for the excellent manner in which he steered the work \r\nof the forty-sixth session. \r\nIt is with a sense of pride and satisfaction that I take this \r\nopportunity, firstly, to congratulate Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, a \r\ndistinguished son of Africa, on his deserved election to the important post of \r\nSecretary-General of our Organization; and, secondly, to express sincere \r\nappreciation to him for the commendable leadership he has showed in carrying \r\nout his duties. Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali\u0027s long and valuable service to \r\nAfrica, especially within the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the central \r\nrole he played in peacemaking under the Camp David accord, and the \r\nconsiderable familiarity he has with the burning issues of the developing \r\nworld give him impeccable credentials for this Organization\u0027s highest and most \r\nchallenging post. We wish him every success; he enjoys Uganda\u0027s full \r\nconfidence; and he can count on our constant cooperation and support.* \r\nUganda welcomes the 13 new Members of the United Nations, with which we \r\nlook forward to forging close and mutually beneficial relations. An important \r\nprinciple of this Organization is self-determination by the people of the \r\nMember States. The admission of new Members is in keeping with that principle. \r\nWhen we gathered here at the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly, \r\nit was against a backdrop of international political developments which had \r\nprofoundly altered the global landscape. The transformation of international \r\nrelations has, over the last year, increased in pace and ushered in a new \r\npattern of relations. In place of the cold war between East and West, we now \r\nMr. Kalpage (Sri Lanka), Vice-President took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n23 \r\n(Mr. Ssemoqerere. Uganda) \r\nsee a more cooperative relationship. Mutual suspicion, conflict and the \r\nattendant arms race between the major Powers have been replaced by dialogue \r\nand joint endeavours. Dictatorships are giving way to democracies, and \r\nconflicts are being resolved through dialogue. \r\nAs a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Uganda has always urged the \r\nmajor Powers to put an end to their rivalry and, instead, pool their efforts \r\nto promote international peace and security and also the economic and social \r\ndevelopment of all countries, as envisaged by the Charter. We therefore \r\nwelcome the emerging peaceful relations among the major Powers, and we \r\naccordingly have a good basis for hoping that investment in economic and \r\nsocial development worldwide will now receive a higher priority. In this \r\nconnection, special note must be taken of the important address to this \r\nsession of the Assembly by President George Bush of the United States when he \r\nput forward new ideas about international economic cooperation. These ideas \r\nmerit serious consideration. \r\nIt will be recalled that the cold-war divisions hampered the efforts of \r\nthe Organization in fulfilling its mandate. But now the correspondence of \r\nobjectives among the permanent members of the Security Council, as \r\ncontemplated by the founding fathers, has facilitated the United Nations \r\ncentral role in finding solutions to various regional crises. From Yugoslavia \r\nand Cambodia to Somalia, to name but a few, it has now become possible for the \r\nUnited Nations to handle the underlying causes of crises without its actions \r\nbeing hamstrung by the ideological differences between its Members. \r\nAs the confidence being reposed in the United Nations has increased, so \r\nhave the responsibilities the Organization is being called upon to undertake. \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n24 \r\n(Mr. Ssemogerere. Uganda) \r\nYet its resources remain precarious. There is an urgent need for the \r\nOrganization to be strengthened, in order to be able to be appropriately \r\nrestructured, and to be provided with adequate means meet the challenges \r\nbefore it. \r\nIt is critical that the United Nations organs be made more representative \r\nso that they can cater more meaningfully to the interests and aspirations of \r\nall its Members. The objective should be to make the decision-making process \r\nin the United Nations, including the Security Council, more democratic and \r\ntransparent. It is with this in mind that Uganda will positively examine the \r\nvarious proposals for reform of the United Nations. We are thus prepared to \r\nexamine proposals for reform and expansion of the Security Council to reflect \r\ncontemporary realities that will lead to a more equitable and balanced \r\nrepresentation without, however, sacrificing capacity and efficiency. \r\nThe present structure of the Security Council reflects the realities of \r\n1945 and the resultant cold war. Countries were designated permanent members \r\nbecause of their capacity, at the time, to contribute to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security and to prevent war. For the record, it ought \r\nto be stated, with appreciation, that the Organization\u0027s structures have \r\ndischarged their principal obligations well, and have, in particular, \r\nsafeguarded the international community against a world war and against a \r\nnuclear catastrophe. \r\nIt must, however, be acknowledged that we are now moving into an age \r\nwhere new issues such as development, environmental protection and \r\ntechnological advancement are critical in international relations and affect \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n25 \r\n(Mr. Ssemogerere. Uganda) \r\nthe security of the world. We therefore believe it is necessary to review the \r\ncriteria for permanent membership in order to take into account the capacity \r\nof countries to contribute in this regard. \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n26 \r\n(Mr. Ssemogerere. Uganda) \r\nIf only for the sake of accountability, it is imperative that Member \r\nStates, on which our Organization will increasingly depend as the main source \r\nof contributions for the implementation of its new agenda for the next \r\ncentury, should also have a say in the decision-making structures of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\nSecondly, in any restructuring of the Council, it is also important that \r\nconsideration be given to having for each major region a permanent member, \r\nwhich would be designated through consultation with the relevant regional \r\ngroups or organizations. An important criterion to take into account is that \r\na country, large or small, seeking membership on the Security Council must \r\nfully embrace, and be seen to act in accordance with, the underlying values of \r\nthe United Nations mandate for peace, respect for human rights, \r\ndemocratization and other accepted international norms. In our view that \r\nwould enhance both confidence in the Council on the part of the Members of the \r\nOrganization and the acceptability of the Council\u0027s decisions. \r\nWhile the rapprochement between the super-Powers, as well as the \r\nprevailing international climate, has been instrumental in the resolution of \r\nlong-standing conflicts, we should not be lulled into complacency. There are \r\nstill many formidable obstacles to overcome in our quest for a more peaceful, \r\nsecure, just and equitable new world order. Along with increased integration \r\namong States and increased democratic governance, we see centrifugal forces \r\ntearing States and societies apart, be it in Europe or in developing \r\ncountries. Many of those conflicts are driven by ethnic, religious, racial or \r\nother sectarian differences and have resulted in the loss of many lives and \r\nthe suffering of very large numbers of innocent people on account of \r\ndisplacement, the destruction of social and economic infrastructure, the \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n27 \r\n(Mr. Ssemogerere. Uganda) \r\nbreakdown of law and order, and the lack of food, medical facilities and \r\nshelter. Quite appropriately, these conflicts ought to be the focus of our \r\nattention in our deliberations. In addressing ourselves to such conflicts, it \r\nis legitimate for the international community to press for their peaceful and \r\nprompt resolution and to resort to such mechanisms as are deemed practical in \r\ncoming to the immediate rescue, with humanitarian assistance, of those who are \r\nsuffering. National sovereignty should not be invoked for the prevention of \r\ndelivering needed humanitarian assistance to the innocent. \r\nIn South Africa we were encouraged by the positive steps taken by \r\nMr. De Klerk towards the dismantling of the apartheid apparatus. The repeal \r\nof the legislative pillars of apartheid the Population Registration Act, the \r\nGroup Areas Act and the Land Act followed by the convening of the Convention \r\nfor a Democratic South Africa (CODESA), gave us hope that at long last we were \r\non the verge of putting in motion an irreversible process towards the \r\nestablishment of a united, non-racial and democratic South Africa. It was \r\ntherefore a matter of deep regret that the process was subseguently undermined \r\nand endangered by the violence which claimed thousands of lives among the \r\nblack population. We vividly recall the carnage at Boipatong early this year \r\nand more recently in the Ciskei bantustan. The failure of. the South African \r\nGovernment to prevent and contain violence clearly raised doubts about the \r\nPretoria Government\u0027s commitment to the process of fully dismantling apartheid \r\nand ushering into the country a truly democratic order. \r\nWe welcome the recent talks between Mr. Nelson Mandela and Mr. De Klerk \r\naimed at breaking the impasse. Those talks should give impetus to the \r\nprocess. The De Klerk Government needs to take drastic steps to control \r\nviolence and to engender confidence in the negotiation process. It should \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n28 \r\n(Mr. Ssemoqerere. Uganda) \r\nalso release all remaining political prisoners without delay. We commend the \r\ndecision of the United Nations to station observers in South Africa at this \r\ntime to monitor the situation and to assist in the process towards democratic \r\nchange. It remains our conviction that many more observers are needed in \r\norder to ensure an effective international presence. \r\nThis Organization has been at the forefront of the struggle against \r\napartheid and it is imperative for it to stay the course until the objective \r\nis achieved. Uganda\u0027s position remains that until the apartheid constitution \r\nis scrapped and replaced with one which guarantees human rights and political \r\nfreedoms to all South Africans on equal terms, we shall not have achieved our \r\ngoal. While agreeable to the phasing out of sanctions in response to the \r\nprogress registered, we believe the international community should maintain \r\nthe necessary pressure to keep the South African Government negotiating in \r\ngood faith. It is critical to agree on a constitution that enjoys the widest \r\nconsensus. To that end, it becomes crucial for all parties in South Africa to \r\ntake part in the negotiations and for South African leaders and the \r\ninternational community to spare no effort in encouraging all necessary \r\nconsultations to ensure that no significant group feels left out. \r\nThe events in South Africa have a great impact on developments elsewhere \r\nin southern Africa. Apartheid has always been a source of destabilization for \r\nthe region, especially for the front-line States, with Angola and Mozambique \r\nbeing the most affected. Over the years, those countries have been the object \r\nof a destabilization campaign that encouraged fratricidal internal conflicts. \r\nWe are glad to note that in both countries progress has been made towards \r\nreconciliation and the comprehensive resolution of their internal conflicts. \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n29 \r\n(Mr. Ssemoqerere. Uganda) \r\nAngola has just held an election in which all the parties have participated. \r\nThe United Nations, through the United Nations Angola Verification Mission, \r\n(UNAVEM) II, has greatly contributed to the creation of an atmosphere \r\nconducive to reconciliation. In Mozambique, the Government and RENAMO have \r\nreached an accord, which is spelt out in the Joint Declaration signed in \r\nRome. We welcome that accord, and it is our hope that a cease-fire agreement \r\nwill soon be signed so as to facilitate elections and pave the way for an \r\nenduring peace. \r\nMozambique, Angola and other front-line States have borne the brunt of \r\nthe struggle against apartheid. Their economic and social infrastructures \r\nhave, in the process, been damaged. Their economies will therefore take a \r\nlong time to recover. The long drought they are currently experiencing has \r\ncompounded these problems. I wish to call on the international community to \r\nrender them the requisite assistance for their economic recovery and \r\ndevelopment. \r\nIn Somalia we have a disaster of enormous proportions which, on the one \r\nhand, is man-made and, on the other, is compounded by drought. Both the OAU \r\nand African leaders in the regional and subregional contexts have made \r\nstrenuous efforts to resolve the underlying political differences, but without \r\nsuccess. Last Saturday President Museveni of my country, with a view to \r\npromoting dialogue between the parties, had discussions with, among others, \r\nSomali interim President Ali Mahdi and General Farah Aideed of the United \r\nSomali Congress, in which he appealed to both of them to resolve their \r\ndifferences. Already the conflict has brought misery and massive loss of life \r\nto the Somali people. A major problem now is that the continued fighting is \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n30 \r\n(Mr. Ssemogerere. Uganda) \r\nmaking it extremely difficult to distribute food. We appeal to the various \r\ngroups in Somalia to put an end to the conflict. We commend the efforts of \r\nthe United Nations and its agencies, such as the United Nations Children\u0027s \r\nFund (UNICEF), at providing humanitarian assistance, and we call on the \r\ninternational community to increase support for this initiative. We appeal to \r\nthe various groups involved in the fighting in Somalia to cooperate with the \r\nUnited Nations and work for national reconciliation. We support the call by \r\nthe current OAU Chairman, President Abdou Diouf of Senegal, for the convening \r\nof an international conference on Somalia after due preparation. \r\nThe Secretary-General, in his annual report and in \"An Agenda for Peace\", \r\nunderscores the role of regional and subregional efforts in defusing tension \r\nand in working out long-term solutions. We agree with the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\nobservations. \r\nIn East Africa the efforts of our Heads of State have gone a long way \r\ntowards finding long-term solutions to regional problems, in particular that \r\nof refugees. \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n31 \r\n(Mr. Ssemogerere. Uganda) \r\nThe joint commissions we have with our neighbours have been most helpful as \r\nconfidence-building measures. The United Nations should be supportive of our \r\nefforts. \r\nAs regards Liberia, Uganda will continue to support the initiative of the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for a peaceful settlement. \r\nThe groups in Liberia should cooperate with the EOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring \r\nGroup (ECOMOG) and abide by the terms of the accord they reached at \r\nYamoussoukro, which were recently reaffirmed by the Dakar summit of ECOWAS, \r\nespecially with regard to demobilization and peaceful transition to democratic \r\ngovernance. There is also need for active involvement of the United Nations \r\nto assist the subregion in preventing the situation from getting* worse. \r\nThe conflict in southern Sudan has been a source of anguish for us. The \r\npeople in this area have for long experienced the agony of war with the \r\nattendant loss of lives and the problems of refugees and population \r\ndisplacement. The path towards a long-term solution lies in dialogue and \r\nreconciliation among the parties in the Sudan. Time is of the essence in this \r\nsituation. Uganda appreciates and encourages the efforts of President \r\nBabangida and of the OAU towards this end. I wish to register our gratitude \r\nto the international community for coming to the rescue of. the civilian \r\npopulation with humanitarian aid. It is our hope that both the Government of \r\nSudan and the Sudanese People\u0027s Liberation Army (SPLA) will facilitate the \r\ninternational humanitarian relief effort, which at the moment is, regrettably, \r\nsuspended, with only little help reaching the affected population. \r\nUganda commends the fruitful regional and international initiatives for \r\nthe resolution of the social and armed conflict in Rwanda. Uganda \r\nacknowledges and supports the ongoing dialogue, under Tanzanian mediation, \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n32 \r\n(Mr. Ssemogerere. Uganda) \r\nbetween the Government of Rwanda and the Rwandese Patriotic Front, in \r\naccordance with agreements and recommendations reached in regional conferences \r\nand under OAU auspices. Uganda appreciates the constructive and helpful role \r\nplayed by the international observers in these negotiations. \r\nAs to Western Sahara, Security Council resolution 690 (1991) remains the \r\nonly agreed basis for the resolution of the problem. It is our hope that the \r\nobstacles with regard to the criteria of eligibility to vote will soon be \r\nresolved so that the way can be paved for holding the referendum as envisaged \r\nin the settlement plan. \r\nThe Middle East crisis, at the core of which is the guestion of \r\nPalestine, has been one of the most intractable problems on the agenda of the \r\nUnited Nations. Peace in the region will continue to be elusive if a solution \r\nis not found to that question. Uganda thus welcomed the United States \r\ninitiative in launching negotiations between all the parties concerned, \r\nbeginning with the Madrid conference last year. While we regret that no \r\nbreakthrough has yet been made, we are encouraged that the dialogue is still \r\ncontinuing. We call on the parties to persist in their negotiations, remove \r\nmutual suspicion, engender confidence, and grapple with the real issues that \r\nwill bring forward a comprehensive, just and durable solution. \r\nUganda welcomed the restoration of Kuwait\u0027s independence, in which the \r\nUnited Nations played a key role. It is our hope that with the Gulf War \r\nbehind us, it will be possible to restore prosperity and to refocus the \r\nenergies of the countries in the region on economic and social development. \r\nAs regards Cyprus, we support the Secretary-General\u0027s efforts to reach an \r\nagreement on fundamental principles for an overall settlement. We maintain \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n33 \r\n(Mr. Ssemogerere. Uganda) \r\nour position that the settlement should safeguard the sovereignty, unity and \r\nterritorial integrity of Cyprus. \r\nIn the Korean peninsula, Uganda continues to be supportive of the \r\naspirations of the Korean people for peaceful reunification. We wish to \r\nencourage them in their dialogue for. this purpose.* \r\nIn Cambodia, we note the progress made by the United Nations Transitional \r\nAuthority in implementing the agreements for a comprehensive political \r\nsettlement. It is for us a matter of regret that there are problems with \r\nregard to the second phase of the cease-fire regarding the regrouping, \r\ncantoning and disarming of the various armed forces. We call on all parties \r\nto the agreements to live up to their undertakings so that peace and stability \r\ncan return to that country. \r\nUganda has been deeply concerned at the continuing conflict in the former \r\nSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was a pillar of the \r\nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries. It contributed a lot to the Movement and \r\nto the struggle for the independence of our States when the cold war was at \r\nits height. It is, therefore, a source of great anguish to see that in its \r\nbreakup, Yugoslavia has become a region of instability, strife and war based \r\non ethnic and religious differences. We reject the notion of \"ethnic \r\ncleansing\" as being repugnant to accepted norms. \r\nThe United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has been functioning under \r\nvery dangerous and trying circumstances. It deserves our maximum support as \r\nit endeavours to restore peace in the area. We call on the parties to embrace \r\nthe path of peace and reconciliation. \r\n* The President returned to the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n34 \r\n(Mr. Ssemogerere. Uganda) \r\nIn the field of disarmament, Uganda welcomes the successful conclusion of \r\nthe negotiations regarding the Convention on the complete and effective \r\nprohibition of the development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons \r\nand on their destruction, which is due to be submitted to the Assembly at this \r\nsession for adoption. As a party to the non-proliferation Treaty, Uganda also \r\nlooks forward to actively participating in the preparation for the 1995 Review \r\nConference, which will decide on the extension of the Treaty. It is our hope \r\nthat the review will strengthen the Treaty by removing the present imbalances, \r\nand result in increased assistance to developing countries in the peaceful \r\napplication of nuclear energy. \r\nUganda is happy to see that the question of human rights has a place of \r\npride on the international agenda. In both our domestic and our foreign \r\npolicies, we give high priority to this issue. As part of its commitment to \r\nthis end, a preoccupation of my Government has been to strengthen the rule of \r\nlaw and our capacity to enforce those rights. We regard the proper training \r\nof law enforcement officials as crucial. Therefore, this has been given due \r\npriority in our programmes. Currently, Uganda has embarked on a process for \r\nthe enactment of a new constitution that should have built-in safeguards for \r\nfundamental human rights and political freedoms. I wish to place on record \r\nour appreciation to those countries that are rendering assistance to Uganda in \r\nthis regard. \r\nUganda looks forward to the third World Conference on Human Rights \r\nscheduled to take place in Vienna next year. That Conference should provide \r\nus with an opportunity to enhance the implementation of existing human rights \r\ninstruments, to develop new norms where necessary, and to examine fully the \r\nintrinsic relationship between human rights and development. \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n35 \r\n(Mr. Ssemogerere. Uganda) \r\nIt has been emphasized that people must be at the centre of development. \r\nWe agree. This requires us to strive for the attainment of social justice and \r\nequality for all peoples. Our avowed commitment for human rights and \r\ndemocracy cannot be taken seriously if it is not egually matched with a \r\ncommitment to address the problems of underdevelopment, mass poverty and the \r\nsocial misery in which the overwhelming majority of the world population is \r\ntrapped. Durable peace can only be anchored in the bedrock of economic \r\nprogress among and within nations. \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n36 \r\n(Mr. Ssemogerere. Uganda) \r\nRegrettably, as we approach the next millennium, the economic and social \r\nproblems of the developing countries continue to worsen. The overall external \r\nenvironment remains unfavourable, with most of our countries confronted with \r\nworsening terms of trade, a crippling debt burden and a reduction in the flow \r\nof resources earmarked for development. While there is increasing integration \r\nin the process of production and the globalization of world trade, the trend \r\nof marginalization of the least developed countries continues. \r\nOf grave concern is the critical economic situation in Africa. The \r\nSecretary-General in his annual report aptly describes the plight of Africa as \r\nfollows: \r\n\"Most Africans are poorer today than they were when their countries \r\nachieved independence in the late 1950s and 1960s. The continent as a \r\nwhole accounts for 32 out of the world\u0027s 47 least developed countries. \r\nAfrica is the only low-income region in the world where the number of \r\npeople living in poverty is, if the current trends continue, likely to \r\nincrease by the year 2000. It is also the only region of the world whose \r\ntotal debt equals or exceeds its economic output. The freshly-witnessed \r\nmomentum for political pluralism in Africa can hardly withstand a \r\ncontinuing assault by desertification, famine and deprivation. Poverty \r\nis infertile soil for democracy. It breeds a search for survival that \r\ncannot be held back by national frontiers. The African countries need to \r\nbecome masters of their economic destiny in a more supportive global \r\nframework.\" (A/47/1, para. 62) \r\nIn response to this plight, the General Assembly adopted at its \r\nforty-sixth session, in resolution 46/151, the New Agenda for the \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Ssemogerere. Uganda) \r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s, whose objective is to accelerate the \r\ntransformation, integration and diversification of African economies. The New \r\nAgenda aims at achieving an average real growth rate in gross national product \r\nof about 6 per cent a year through the decade, paying special attention to \r\nsuch goals as increased life expectancy, lower rates of child and maternal \r\nmortality, and improved health, water, sanitation, basic education and shelter. \r\nMost African countries have undertaken major reforms of their internal \r\neconomic policies and mechanisms. In Uganda, for example, we are committed to \r\nthe liberalization of the economy and have enacted an attractive foreign \r\ninvestment code. These reforms can be meaningful only if the external \r\neconomic environment is supportive and there is a positive response in the \r\nform of increased investment and trade. It will be recalled that the United \r\nNations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development 1986-1990 did \r\nnot achieve its objectives because of the failure of the international \r\ncommunity to provide the requisite resources. For the New Agenda to succeed, \r\ntherefore, our partners must have the political will to live up to their \r\ncommitments. \r\nThe System-Wide Plan of Action which is before the General Assembly \r\nprovides a framework for the United Nations system to give more focussed \r\nattention to Africa. In this regard, Uganda strongly welcomes the \r\nInternational Conference for Assistance to African Children, scheduled to take \r\nplace in Dakar in November, and we commend the United Nations Children\u0027s Fund \r\nfor the preparatory work already undertaken. \r\nWe appeal to the international agencies to earmark resources for the \r\nimplementation of the New Agenda. In this connection, we commend the \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n38 \r\n(Mr. Ssemogerere. Uganda) \r\nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development\u0027s Special Programme for \r\nSub-Saharan Africa. I also wish to register my appreciation to the Government \r\nof Japan for initiating and arranging to host, in 1993, an African development \r\nconference that will bring together African countries, major aid donors and \r\ninternational agencies to discuss ways and means of accelerating African \r\neconomic development. \r\nTwo major conferences were held last year: the Eighth United Nations \r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VIII) and the United Nations \r\nConference on Environment and Development, which culminated in Agenda 21. It \r\nis necessary to maintain the momentum achieved at Rio and at UNCTAD VIII by \r\nputting in place measures to implement those decisions. The Rio Summit \r\nestablished a clear link between environment, growth and development. The \r\nneed to help developing countries achieve sustainable development was \r\nunderscored. It is our hope that the Uruguay Round will soon be successfully \r\ncompleted and that it will remove the impediments to our products reaching the \r\nmarkets of the industrialized countries. \r\nIn the report \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277), issued as a follow-up to \r\nthe statement adopted at the conclusion of the Security Council\u0027s historic \r\nSummit meeting of 31 January 1992, the Secretary-General outlines his \r\nproposals on how the United Nations role in the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security can be strengthened. The report contains a number of \r\nuseful proposals on preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peace-building and the \r\nrole of regional groupings which, if adopted, will enhance the effectiveness \r\nof the United Nations. We agree that regional arrangements in many cases \r\npossess a potential for early warning of. \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n39 \r\n(Mr. Ssemogerere. Uganda) \r\nmonitoring and defusing conflict situations, a potential that should be \r\nrealized. The United Nations and the international community should help them \r\nto improve that capability. \r\nThe Organization of African Unity, for example, is in the process of \r\ntrying to establish a mechanism for conflict-prevention, conflict management \r\nand conflict-resolution. Such a mechanism would strengthen the OAU\u0027s \r\npeace-keeping capabilities. Any assistance given in this regard will be an \r\nimportant and useful investment for peace and development in Africa. \r\nI wish to emphasize that, as indicated in the Secretary-General\u0027s annual \r\nreport, underdevelopment and poverty are prime sources of conflict. The \r\nUnited Nations, through its macroeconomic policy formulation and \r\nimplementation, has played a central role in forging global consensus on \r\ndevelopment issues. As envisaged by the United Nations Charter, the \r\nOrganization must continue fulfilling this function, especially now, when many \r\ndeveloping countries are restructuring with a view to integrating their \r\nnations into the global economy. We should therefore endeavour to integrate \r\nour agenda for peace with our agenda for development. By strengthening the \r\nOrganization\u0027s peacemaking and peace-keeping capabilities, we should not, by \r\ndefault or neglect, reduce the United Nations focus on economic and social \r\nissues. Clearly, development and peace are so intimately related that they \r\nmust be tackled under a common agenda. \r\nWe stand at a historic watershed, especially given the fact that the \r\nglobal transition period we are entering is marked by contradictory trends. \r\nAt this crossroads, however, a unique opportunity exists for the United \r\nNations to achieve the objectives envisaged in the Charter. Whether or not \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n40 \r\n(Mr. Ssemogerere. Uganda) \r\nthe United Nations can help create a better world for the twenty-first \r\ncentury, in which the interests of us all are adequately catered for, depends \r\non the structures we create now. History will judge us harshly if we fail to \r\nconstruct a firm foundation for the edifice of the future. That is our \r\nchallenge. \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n41 \r\nAGENDA ITEM 146 \r\nEMERGENCY ASSISTANCE TO PAKISTAN: DRAFT RESOLUTION (A/47/L.2) \r\nThe PRESIDENT: In connection with this item, the General Assembly \r\nhas before it a draft resolution issued as document A/47/L.2. I call on the \r\nrepresentative of Turkey to introduce the draft resolution. \r\nMr. AKSIN (Turkey): Last month, a natural disaster of enormous \r\nproportions struck Pakistan. The torrential rainfall in the northern areas of \r\nPakistan caused extensive flooding, leading to many deaths and much material \r\ndamage. As a result of this catastrophe, more than 1,000 people lost their \r\nlives and tens of thousands of homes were destroyed. In addition to \r\nwidespread damage to bridges, roads, railroads, and telecommunication lines, \r\nsome six million people have been rendered homeless. \r\nAlthough the Government of Pakistan has taken urgent measures to \r\nalleviate the suffering of the victims, it is clear that, given the magnitude \r\nof the calamity, national efforts will not suffice. There is a pressing need \r\nfor international assistance by Governments and other organizations. \r\nIt is in response to this need that I have the honour to introduce, on \r\nbehalf of the 63 sponsoring countries, the draft resolution entitled \r\n\"Emergency assistance to Pakistan\" contained in document A/47/L.2. The \r\nfollowing countries have decided to join the sponsors listed in the document: \r\nthe Bahamas, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cyprus, El Salvador, Ethiopia, \r\nGuatemala, Guinea-Bissau, Jordan, Kuwait, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, \r\nMadagascar, Mali, the Russian Federation, the Sudan, Uganda, the United Arab \r\nEmirates and Yemen. \r\nThe draft resolution is made up of four preambular and five operative \r\nparagraphs. It calls for the Secretary-General, in cooperation with the \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Aksin. Turkey) \r\nrelevant organs and organizations of the United Nations system and in close \r\ncollaboration with the Government authorities, to assist in the rehabilitation \r\nefforts of the Government of Pakistan. It also requests all States and \r\ninternational organizations and other intergovernmental agencies to extend \r\nemergency support to Pakistan to alleviate the economic and financial burden \r\nof the people of Pakistan. \r\nThe draft resolution expresses in a tangible way our deep sympathy for \r\nthe victims in their hour of suffering. At the same time, it demonstrates our \r\nreadiness to contribute morally and materially towards the rehabilitation of \r\nthe millions whose lives have been so cruelly disrupted. \r\nI am confident that, true to the principle of international solidarity \r\nwith the victims of disasters, the General Assembly will rally to the \r\nassistance of the Government and the people of Pakistan and adopt the draft \r\nresolution by consensus. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/47/L.2. \r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution \r\nA/47/L.2? \r\nDraft resolution A/47/L.2 was adopted (resolution 47/2). \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I shall now call on those representatives who wish \r\nto explain their position on the resolution just adopted. I should like to \r\nremind delegations that, in accordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, \r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats. \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n43 \r\nMr. SRREENIVASAN (India): My delegation joined the consensus in \r\nsupport of draft resolution A/47/L.2, entitled \"Emergency assistance to \r\nPakistan\". \r\nIndia was deeply moved by the extensive damage and devastation caused in \r\nPakistan by the unprecedented floods in that country. Certain parts of India \r\nwere also severely affected by the rain and floods. India was one of the \r\nfirst countries to rush emergency assistance to Pakistan as soon as the extent \r\nof the damage came to be known. \r\nSeveral other countries have also extended assistance, and it is only \r\nappropriate that the General Assembly should commend these efforts and request \r\nothers to extend support to Pakistan to alleviate the suffering of the \r\nafflicted people. \r\nMy delegation is disappointed that Pakistan has chosen to make an \r\nunwarranted reference to the so-called Azad Jammu and Kashmir in its \r\nexplanatory memorandum contained in the annex to document A/47/244. India\u0027s \r\nposition on this matter is well known and reguires no reiteration. I should \r\nonly like to state that our support of the resolution on emergency assistance \r\nto Pakistan is without prejudice to our position on Jammu and Kashmir. \r\nMr. MARKER (Pakistan): On behalf of my delegation, I should like to \r\ntake this opportunity to express to you, Mr. President, and to the Assembly \r\nour profound thanks for the consideration and adoption by consensus of the \r\ndraft resolution on emergency assistance to Pakistan. I should further like \r\nto convey my delegation\u0027s deep appreciation to the members of the General \r\nCommittee for their valuable support and understanding shown in recommending \r\nthe inscription of a new agenda item as well as its consideration directly in \r\nthe plenary Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.28 \r\n44 \r\n(Mr. Marker. Pakistan) \r\nI wish to convey my delegation\u0027s special thanks to my friend, brother and \r\ncolleague. Ambassador Mustafa Aksin, Permanent Representative of Turkey, for \r\nintroducing the draft resolution, and also to all the delegations which \r\nsponsored it and those delegations which supported it. \r\nI especially wish to convey my delegation\u0027s deep appreciation and \r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the \r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs for the measures they have \r\nalready taken for coordinating relief measures as appropriate with the \r\nauthorities in Pakistan. \r\nWith reference to the observations made by the representative of India, I \r\nwould reiterate Pakistan\u0027s well-known position that the issue of Jammu and \r\nKashmir remains on the agenda of the Security Council awaiting a peaceful \r\nsolution. \r\nThe adoption of draft resolution A/47/L.2 is a clear manifestation of the \r\ninternational community\u0027s support for the people and the Government of \r\nPakistan. It is also a substantive demonstration of the spirit of solidarity \r\nand cooperation which permeates the membership of the United Nations whenever \r\nand wherever there are natural disasters of great magnitude. We value this \r\ntimely support and are convinced that it will contribute materially towards \r\nmitigating the devastating consequences of the unprecedented floods which have \r\ncaused so much havoc in my country. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item 146? \r\nIt was so decided. \r\nThe meeting rose at 12.10 p.m. \r\n"
