RABUKA, PRIME MINISTER OF THE \r\nREPUBLIC OF FIJI \r\nThe PRESIDENT; The Assembly will first hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Fiji. \r\nMaior-General Sitiveni L. Rabuka. Prime Minister of the Republic of Fiji-\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have great pleasure in welcoming the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Fiji, His Excellency the Honourable \r\nMajor-General Sitiveni L. Rabuka, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\nMr. RABUKA (Fiji): It is my honour and privilege, on behalf of the \r\nGovernment and people of Fiji, to convey to you. Sir, our warmest \r\ncongratulations upon your election to the high office of President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-seventh session. We are confident that under \r\nyour distinguished leadership the Assembly at this session will be guided to a \r\nmost successful conclusion. f \r\nMy delegation extends its deep appreciation to your predecessor, \r\nMr. Samir Shihabi, for his exemplary leadership during the last session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\nSince our last session, a year ago, several new Members have joined the \r\nOrganization. My delegation welcomes them most warmly. We believe that the \r\nnear-universality of membership of the United Nations that we now have can \r\nlead to greater understanding and ultimately to concrete action in the search \r\nfor lasting solutions to many of the problems facing our global community. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n3 \r\n(Mr. Rabuka. Fiji) \r\nThe report of the Secretary-General is broad, and it demonstrates the \r\ncomplexity of the issues that concern the world today. My delegation commends \r\nthe Secretary-General for his comprehensive report and for the important steps \r\nhe has taken to carry out the various tasks that our Organization has assigned \r\nto him. We hope that at its forty-seventh session the General Assembly will \r\nhelp to find real solutions to these problems. \r\nThe last few years have been a period of profound changes. With the end \r\nof the cold war, we have witnessed a new wave of nationalism surging in \r\nseveral parts of the world. This reflects an intense yearning for \r\nself-determination, especially in the political and economic spheres. At the \r\nsame time, we have seen the world economy moving towards even greater \r\ninterdependence and integration. In these developments, we see bright \r\nprospects and opportunities, but we also see the emergence of new problems, \r\ngreater uncertainties and more unresolved inequities. \r\nIn the Horn of Africa in Somalia a human tragedy of unprecedented \r\ndimensions is unfolding. War, drought and the collapse of civil authority \r\nthreaten the lives of millions. Starvation has already claimed the lives of \r\nthousands of Somalis. All international efforts to respond to the \r\noverwhelming needs of the people of Somalia must be stepped up. \r\nWe fully support the United Nations in its role in Cambodia, and we have \r\ncontributed 50 police personnel to the United Nations Transitional Authority \r\nin Cambodia (UNTAC). The task facing UNTAC is certainly not easy. Fiji \r\nbelieves that the Cambodian people must be given the opportunity to determine \r\nfreely their own political destiny and to enjoy the peace, stability and \r\nwell-being to which they have aspired for so long. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n4 \r\nfMr. Rabuka. Fiii) \r\nWe hope that the reform process in South Africa can build on the progress \r\nthat has already been made. We urge that the efforts to dismantle apartheid \r\nproceed as quickly as possible so that more deaths and bloodshed may be \r\navoided. The international community must continue to assist the people of \r\nSouth Africa in their endeavour to bring an effective end to violence and to \r\ncreate the conditions for dismantling of apartheid in their country. \r\nMy country commended both Koreas for taking seats last year as new \r\nMembers of this Organization. It is encouraging to note that since then the \r\ntwo Koreas have intensified their dialogue and that they are taking important \r\nsteps to strengthen further the ties between their two countries. The \r\nreunification of the Koreas will go a long way towards ensuring peace and \r\nstability in North-East Asia. \r\nFiji welcomes the Middle East peace process that is taking place. We \r\nhope that the parties concerned will seize the opportunity to seek a \r\ncomprehensive and just solution to the Middle East issues, in line with the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. We call upon all the parties involved \r\nto make every possible effort and to demonstrate all possible understanding, \r\nwith a view to bringing about a just and permanent peace in the area. Fiji \r\nhas already lost several of its soldiers engaged in peace-keeping duties in \r\nthe cause of peace in the area. We therefore firmly believe that a positive \r\noutcome to the process would be a fitting tribute to all those gallant \r\nsoldiers who died for the noblest cause in our world - the cause of peace. \r\nThe gap between the developed countries and the developing countries has \r\nwidened. The world\u0027s population has grown to 5.5 billion, and much of the \r\ngrowth has taken place in the developing countries, which are home for \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n5 \r\n(Mr. Rabuka. Fiji) \r\n77 per cent of the world\u0027s people. Moreover, about 1.4 billion of the world\u0027s \r\npeople live in extreme poverty, and the external debt of developing countries \r\ncontinues to grow. \r\nAs Fiji is a developing country, faced with its people\u0027s rising \r\nexpectations of improved conditions of living, we believe that the \r\ninternational community must make every effort to address and find solutions \r\nto the economic problems that we face. We urge the United Nations to continue \r\nto play a catalytic role in the creation of an international economic \r\nenvironment that will enhance the economies of the developing and \r\nunderdeveloped countries of the world. \r\nI am aware that a process of review and revitalization of the United \r\nNations is already under way. We in Fiji fully support the process, and I \r\nurge all Members of the Organization to do likewise so that programmes to meet \r\nthe challenges of closer international cooperation may be created. \r\nWe welcome the reforms that have already been put in place to strengthen \r\nthe Economic and Social Council. The Charter envisages the Council\u0027s being \r\nable to provide Member States and relevant bodies and agencies within the \r\nUnited Nations system with overall direction and guidance on all matters \r\nrelating to social and economic development. The Council should explore new \r\nneeds, priorities and opportunities for joint international action and should \r\ncoordinate them. A sense of priority in such changes will strengthen the \r\nimpact of resolutions. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n6 \r\nfMr. Rabuka. Fiii) \r\nMy Government firmly believes that the private sector has a pivotal role \r\nto play in the development of the economy and therefore of the nation. We are \r\ntaking a number of steps to enhance and facilitate private-sector activity. \r\nIn this regard, as a relatively small island State, we welcome several \r\nprivate-sector initiatives which the United States of America has announced \r\nfor our region, including the proposed United States-Pacific island countries \r\njoint commercial commission. \r\nFiji also strongly supports efforts to liberalize world trade, and in \r\nparticular we look forward to a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of \r\ntrade negotiations. In fact, Fiji is already committed to giving the smaller \r\nPacific island countries in our region duty-free access to our markets for a \r\nnumber of commodities and products. \r\nTo ensure the economic development of developing countries, it is vital \r\nthat our exports be ensured greater access to markets of developed countries. \r\nThe terms of trade for developing countries\u0027 exports, especially for \r\ncommodities, should also be significantly improved. There can be no doubt \r\nthat the only credible option for generalized prosperity and development is a \r\ntruly open and liberalized trading system. \r\nThe Government of Fiji is committed to this objective. In the last few \r\nyears our own trade regime has been liberalized considerably. Import quotas \r\nhave been replaced with tariffs. The Government remains committed to \r\ncontinuous and steady reductions in the overall level of import protection. \r\nIn addition, we are continuing to pursue a policy of attracting foreign \r\ninvestments through generous incentives to foreign investors wishing to set up \r\nexport and manufacturing facilities in our country. \r\nA/47-/PV.3-0 \r\n7 \r\n(Mr. Rabuka. Fiji) \r\nMy country was pleased to participate in the United Nations Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, in June. I reaffirm \r\nour full commitment to the several decisions taken at the Conference, \r\nincluding the Rio Declaration, Agenda 21, the Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, the Convention on Biodiversity and the Statement on forest principles. \r\nMy Government supports the proposed commission on sustainable \r\ndevelopment, which is to be discussed later in this session. We particularly \r\nsupport the proposal that the commission be the main forum for consultation \r\nand leadership on the implementation of Agenda 21 at the global, regional and \r\nnational levels. The commission should be able to review progress in \r\nimplementation of Agenda 21, as well as provide a forum for further \r\ndevelopment and updating in the light of all future developments in the \r\ntechnological, legal, economic, financial and other areas. To be effective, \r\nthe commission must be supported by a. small and well-organized secretariat. \r\nGlobal warming and a rise in the sea level pose serious threats to the \r\nvery existence of a number of our neighbouring small island States in the \r\nSouth Pacific, and, I dare say, in other parts of the world. We welcome, \r\ntherefore, the Framework Convention on Climate Change as an important first \r\nstep towards addressing these threats. We want to see the Convention put into \r\neffect as early as possible. Negotiations of protocols should commence soon, \r\nespecially on targets and timetables for the reduction of carbon dioxide and \r\nother greenhouse gas emissions. \r\nWe also welcome UNCED\u0027s call for a series of meetings and conferences on \r\nthe sustainable development of small island countries. Fiji supports the \r\nA/47/PVi30 \r\n8 \r\n(Mr. Rabuka. Fiji) \r\nconvening of the first global conference on small island states\u0027 sustainable \r\ndevelopment and its implications, and we will eagerly follow progress on the \r\narrangements for the conference. \r\nAgenda 21 also called for conferences on the conservation and management \r\nof fish resources, one of the main sources of livelihood for many of our small \r\nisland countries. Fiji endorses the Agenda 21 chapter on marine living \r\nresources and, in particular, the proposed United Nations intergovernmental \r\nconference to address the issue of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory \r\nspecies in the context of the Convention on the Law of the Sea. \r\nUNCED was a major step forward, but the next step may be more difficult. \r\nThe spirit in which the various agreements were conceived and adopted needs to \r\nbe matched by their speedy implementation. \r\nWe are pleased that a good start has been made with the recently \r\nannounced \"Capacity 21\" initiative by the United Nations Development Programme \r\n(UNDP), which aims at providing support to developing countries in the \r\npreparation and management of their own sustainable development plans. This \r\ninitiative will go a long way towards translating Agenda 21 into effective \r\nnational programmes. \r\nToday the world recognizes that basic human and social dimensions of \r\ndevelopment have long been neglected. UNDP\u0027s latest \"Human Development \r\nReport\" reminds us that development means involving people, placing them at \r\nthe centre of all decision-making. At the United Nations, we, too, must place \r\npeople at the centre\u0027of all our activities. \r\nI ask Member States to support the proposed world summit for social \r\ndevelopment, to be convened in 1995. The summit should elevate important \r\nA/47/PV%30 \r\n9-10 \r\n(Mr. Rabuka. Fiji) \r\nsocial issues and allow socio-economic questions to be addressed more \r\ncomprehensively than has been done in the past. \r\nFurthermore, the International Conference on Population and Development, \r\nto be convened in Egypt in September 1994, will provide an added focus on the \r\nrelationship between population and.social development. My country looks \r\nforward to participating in both conferences. \r\nWe have received the report of the Secretary-General, \"An Agenda for \r\nPeace\" (A/47/277), containing his constructive analysis and recommendations on \r\nways to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations for preventive \r\ndiplomacy, peace-building and peace-keeping. We applaud the Secretary-General \r\nfor his pertinent recommendations and for some of the measures that he has \r\nalready taken. \r\nPeace-keeping has eased tension and conflicts in several areas of the \r\nworld. Fiji takes pride in being one of the countries contributing troops \r\nthat are helping to promote and maintain peace in different parts of the \r\nworld. We support the extension of United Nations peace-keeping into new \r\nfields, including the prevention of conflicts and peace-building, as suggested \r\nby the Secretary-General in his report to the Assembly. We recognize, \r\nhowever, that peace-keeping operations can be successful only with the full \r\ncooperation of the parties and a clearly defined mandate from the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\nA/47/PV.*30 \r\n11 \r\n(Mr. Rabuka. Fiji) \r\nAs a former military officer, I know only too well that peace-keeping \r\ncosts money and that financial contributions to our Organization are vital to \r\nthe ultimate goal of secure and lasting peace in our universe. My delegation \r\nappreciates the undertaking by previous speakers to ensure adequate financial \r\nsupport for United Nations peace-keeping and humanitarian activities. \r\nIt is perhaps appropriate at this point to remind this gathering that \r\nwhen the former Deputy Prime Minister of Fiji, the Honourable \r\nJosefata Kamikamica, addressed the Assembly in 1991, he indicated that my \r\ncountry would hold a general election in 1992 under our new Constitution. A \r\npeaceful general election, in which all the major political parties \r\nparticipated, was held in May this year. Since then, we have had two sessions \r\nof the new Parliament. I felt constrained to mention this because there is a \r\ngrowing demand in the world today for democracy, a necessary aspect of which \r\nis the holding of regular elections. \r\nPrevious representatives of my country who have addressed the Assembly \r\nwithin the last four years adverted to the changes which had taken place and \r\nwere still taking place in Fiji on the new Constitution that was promulgated \r\nin 1990 on the basis of recommendations by an independent multiracial national \r\ncommission. I take great pleasure in informing this assembly of the world \r\nthat my Government has committed itself to a review of the 1990 Constitution \r\nof Fiji. Preparatory work has already begun with regard to the mechanism and \r\nprocedures for implementing this review. All communities in Fiji will be \r\nconsulted fully in the review process. It will also involve the \r\nrepresentatives of the people in Parliament and all the political parties. \r\nAs of December 1988 indigenous Fijians numbered about 345,000 out of a \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n12 \r\n(Mr. Rabuka. Fiji) \r\ntotal population of 720,000. Fiji is their indigenous homeland. In fact, the \r\nFijians, through their mataqalis land-owning units own 83 per cent of all \r\nthe land in Fiji. We have a distinct culture and identity which we must, of \r\nnecessity, foster and develop for the very survival of the Fijian race. My \r\nGovernment is committed to providing continuing special assistance to the \r\nindigenous Fijians until they achieve comparable economic status with the \r\nother communities in Fiji, in keeping with the indigenous policies and \r\nprogrammes in many of our member countries. \r\nI should also like to express my Government\u0027s sincere and deep \r\nappreciation of the valuable efforts of the Working Group on Indigenous People \r\nin drafting the Universal Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People. My \r\nGovernment, while reviewing our Constitution, is also committed to taking into \r\naccount the meaning and obligations of this United Nations Declaration and all \r\nthe recent developments in international and constitutional law on indigenous \r\nand tribal rights. My Government also supports the declaration of 1993 as the \r\nInternational Year for the World\u0027s Indigenous People. \r\nAnd while we look forward to observing 1993 as the International Year for \r\nthe World\u0027s Indigenous People, we are also coming to the close of a very \r\nimportant year, the International Year for Disabled Persons. The disabled are \r\npresent in every class, in every race, in every culture and in every country. \r\nA feature the disabled share with indigenous groups is that, while they are \r\npresent, they are often not heard. We commend the United Nations for its \r\nefforts all along, including this year, in bringing to the fore the concerns \r\nof the disabled. \r\nMy country remains committed to the work of the Special Committee on \r\ndecolonization. The success that has been achieved so far should not lead us \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n13 \r\n(MrT Rahuka. Fiii) \r\nto forget what remains to be done. In the South Pacific region, we are \r\nencouraged by the measures being taken by the French Government under the \r\nMatignon Agreements to provide a framework for New Caledonia\u0027s evolution \r\ntowards self-determination and independence. My Government welcomed the \r\nFrench Government\u0027s decision to allow a South Pacific ministerial mission to \r\nvisit New Caledonia last year and to facilitate regular visits by United \r\nNations missions in the future. We look forward to the mid-term review of the \r\nMatignon Agreements towards the end of the year. We consider this essential \r\nin ensuring that progress is maintained towards the decolonization of New \r\nCaledonia. \r\nFiji will continue to oppose nuclear testing and the dumping of nuclear \r\nand other toxic wastes in the South Pacific region. The cessation of these \r\nactivities is vital for our very survival and the preservation of our fragile \r\necosystem. We in the South Pacific welcome the recent decision by France to \r\nsuspend its nuclear testing in the region. We are greatly encouraged by \r\nFrance\u0027^ accession to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty, and we hope that \r\nFrance will also become a party to the Protocol of the South Pacific \r\nNuclear-Free Zone Treaty. \r\nAt the same time, my Government also welcomes the decision by the United \r\nStates to cease the operation of its chemical-weapons incineration facility at \r\nJohnston Atoll. \r\nWe also applaud Japan\u0027s decision to cease large-scale drift-net fishing, \r\noften described as the \"Wall of Death\", in our South Pacific waters, and we in \r\nthat region earnestly pray that other distant-water-fishing nations will soon \r\nmake similar decisions. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n14-15 \r\n(Mr. Rabuka. Fiji) \r\nSecure and lasting peace in our world is what we must all aspire to. \r\nDisarmament and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction are essential \r\nrequirements for peace. I believe that the Members of this Organization, all \r\nof us, should work together with total commitment to create and maintain \r\nsecure and lasting peace on our planet, and simultaneously to increase and \r\nexpand economic and social benefits to all the peoples of our world. \r\nFinally, our world today is what we, its nations, make it. With a \r\nknowledge of yesterday, with our experiences of today, let us all, great and \r\nsmall, rich and poor, as Members of this international Organization, \r\nrededicate our energies and efforts and commit ourselves to building a better \r\nworld for us and for those generations which come after us. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Fiji for the statement he has just made. \r\nMajor-General Sitiveni L. Rabuka. Prime Minister of the Republic of Fiji. \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n16 \r\nMr. KAPUTIN (Papua New Guinea): On behalf of the Government and \r\npeople of Papua New Guinea, I should like to congratulate you. Sir, on your \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh \r\nsession. Your personal presence in this Hall, and your unanimous election to \r\npreside over our proceedings, are symbolic not only of the stirring changes \r\nwhich have been occurring in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, but \r\nof the manner in which they have been welcomed around the world. In offering \r\nyou my delegation\u0027s greetings, cooperation and support, I should also like to \r\npay tribute to the efficient manner in which your predecessor. \r\nAmbassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, performed his duties. \r\nJust as your election. Sir, is symbolic of wider changes in the world, so \r\nis the presence here for the first time of delegations from States which for a \r\nperiod were incorporated in the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. My \r\ndelegation takes very great pleasure in welcoming the membership of, and \r\nparticipation in the United Nations by, the nine States which were once part \r\nof the Soviet Union and the three States which were once part of Yugoslavia \r\nwhose representatives have just joined us. Their presence provides eloquent \r\ntestimony to the power of ordinary people to resist - and eventually to \r\novercome - both the ideology and the technology that are used in order to \r\noppress them. \r\nWith the addition of San Marino, the goal of universal membership - and \r\nof global coverage - of the United Nations is now in sight. \r\nComing from a region where membership of the United Nations is less \r\nwidespread than it is in other parts of the world, I pledge my Government\u0027s \r\ncooperation in the efforts to strengthen links between other South Pacific \r\nisland States and the United Nations. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n17 \r\n(Mr. Kaputin. Papua New Guinea) \r\nPrevious statements in this debate have made it quite clear that we have, \r\nin the words of the Secretary-General in \"An Agenda for Peace\", \r\n\"entered a time of global transition.\" (A/47/277, para. 11) \r\nThe Jakarta Message issued by the Tenth Summit Conference of Heads of \r\nState or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement, of which my Government has \r\njust become a full member, describes the present as \"a time of profound change \r\nand rapid transition.\" But transition to what? And will the effects be the \r\nsame around the globe? \r\nEven as we welcome the end of the cold war, we would do well to bear in \r\nmind the observation made in \"An Agenda for Peace\", that \r\n\"the issues between States north and south grow more acute.\" (A/47/277. \r\npara. 8) \r\nIt is, again in the words of the Jakarta Message: \r\n\"a time of great promise as well as grave challenge, a time of \r\nopportunity amidst pervasive uncertainty.\" \r\nIt is no accident that the preamble to the Charter contains not only \r\npolitical, but economic and social objectives, or that the Charter provides \r\nfor both a Security Council and an Economic and Social Council. Security has \r\nnever been simply a military or a political question; it has always had \r\neconomic and social aspects. For people in developing countries in particular \r\nthe economic and social aspects of security are inseparable from and often \r\nof great immediate importance than the military and political aspects. \r\nIf the transition on which so many previous speakers believe we have \r\nembarked is to be towards global peace, then we need to pay greater attention \r\nto the economic and social issues which divide North and South. Thus my \r\nGovernment supports the proposal to convene, looks forward to taking part in. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n18 \r\n(Mr. Kaputin. Papua New Guinea) \r\nand hopes for a positive outcome from, the world summit for social development \r\nproposed to be held in 1995. \r\nDisappointed though my Government is in the level of agreement reached at \r\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in \r\nRio de Janeiro in June this year, we shall continue to support the UNCED \r\neffort in particular and similar efforts by the United Nations generally. We \r\nhave therefore offered to host a regional post-Rio seminar to follow up on \r\nUNCED in Port Moresby in November. \r\nMy Government welcomes the changes which have allowed people in Central \r\nand Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia to participate directly in \r\nnational political and economic life again. We welcome them and their \r\nGovernments to greater participation in international political and economic \r\naffairs, too. \r\nWe welcome no less the changes which have led to the replacement of \r\ndictatorships in Africa, Latin America and elsewhere. But in doing so I would \r\nnot be honest unless I added that we are concerned about ensuring that the \r\nchange is both comprehensive and enduring. \r\nMy Government is profoundly disturbed by the savage violence and terrible \r\nsuffering being experienced by the victims of \"ethnic cleansing\" in the former \r\nYugoslavia and of interracial, religious and ethnic conflicts there and \r\nelsewhere. \r\nWe sympathize with the concerns expressed by the members of the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, and support the efforts being made by \r\nthe United Nations and the European Economic Community to reduce these \r\nconflicts and to provide aid. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n19-20 \r\n(Mr. Kaputin. Papua New Guinea) \r\nBut, as the Secretary-General has so pointedly reminded the world, there \r\nare terrible conflicts and suffering no less worthy of attention in other \r\nparts of the world, including Somalia. \r\nIt seems distressingly significant that evert after the end of the cold \r\nwar, and during the global transition which the Secretary-General has so \r\neloquently analysed, part of the world where most humans live and where needs \r\nare greatest is still referred to and treated as a very poor third. \r\nI ask you. Sir, to cast your mind back to the 1960s, when foreign \r\ndomination came to an end in many parts of the world, a record number of new \r\nMembers was admitted to the United Nations and the prospects for democracy and \r\ndevelopment seemed, by common consent, to be quite bright. Then think of the \r\neconomic difficulties which often followed, and the dictatorships which all \r\ntoo frequently lasted until the present transition. And then ask why, \r\nwhatever our hopes might be, we should expect that the future will be \r\ndifferent. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n21 \r\n(Mr. Kaputin, \r\nPapua New Guinea) \r\nThe world has learned or, at least, should have learned - from the \r\npast. But have we all drawn the right conclusions? And what have we done to \r\nact on even the most obvious of our conclusions? \r\nIt is one thing to welcome the holding of free elections. It is quite \r\nanother to be certain either that they make a difference, or that they will \r\ncontinue to be held in an orderly, constitutional and fair way. \r\nPoliticians characteristically promise results. Their ability to be \r\nre-elected depends on results. So, too, does democracy itself. In other \r\nwords, democracy, like security, is more than a matter of politics; it also \r\nhas economic and social roots. \r\nIn developing countries or, more precisely, countries where development \r\nis a far-distant aim rather than a near-reality democracy depends not only \r\non opportunities for political participation, but on opportunities for \r\neconomic and social participation as well. As one who has played a modest \r\npart in constitution-making in Papua New Guinea, I am proud that the National \r\nGoals and Directive Principles contained in our national Constitution \r\nexplicitly recognize that point. \r\nI can recall a time, before Papua New Guinea became independent, when not \r\nonly free elections but free markets were widely regarded as characteristic \r\nor, at least, attainable - goals of many developing countries. I can also \r\nrecall the pain and anger felt by ordinary village people when they discovered \r\nthat free elections and free markets did not necessarily benefit them. \r\nI am, in fact, spokesman for a movement which mobilized tens of thousands \r\nof people to ensure that political and economic development would serve their \r\ninterests, and which paved the way to Papua New Guinea\u0027s independence. It is \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n22 \r\n(Mr. Kaputin. \r\nPapua New Guinea) \r\nprecisely because of the lessons I learned from, and with, my people that I \r\nhave chosen to make opportunity and participation the main theme of the policy \r\nI shall follow as my Government\u0027s Minister for Foreign Affairs. Those lessons \r\nare also among the reasons why my Government will be seeking support for an \r\ninitiative designed to help identify, create, maintain, diversify and enlarge \r\nopportunities for economic participation, with particular reference to \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" is a most constructive contribution to thinking \r\nabout conflict-avoidance, conflict-management and conflict-reduction after the \r\nend of the cold war. The initiative on self-determination being pursued by the \r\nGovernment of Liechtenstein should provide support for, and assist in, the \r\ndevelopment of ideas contained in the report. Ongoing discussions concerning \r\noptions for reform of the United Nations, including the High-Level Working \r\nGroup set up by the Non-Aligned Movement, as well as many statements made in \r\nthe current debate, are clearly intended to contribute to the same end. It is \r\nsurely among the most promising signs of the times that we can talk of a \r\nglobal agenda at all - and that the global agenda should be for peace. \r\nThe initiative which my Government proposes is intended to be, in effect, \r\nthe economic counterpart to \"An Agenda for Peace\". Our aim is not to engage \r\nagain in a general debate on development issues - although we have an obvious \r\ninterest in continuing discussion of the nature, direction, pace and \r\ninternational environment for developmental change but to stimulate the \r\nexchange of practical ideas and experiences relevant to enhancing and \r\nincreasing opportunities for economic participation for the benefit of people \r\nin developing countries. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n23 \r\n(Mr. Kaputin. \r\nPapua New Guinea) \r\nIn short, the proposal is to seek support for the appointment of a panel \r\nof distinguished, expert and experienced persons to prepare a practical report \r\nbased on experience in diverse countries and on a close, critical analysis of \r\npossible options for presentation to the United Nations. \r\nMy Government\u0027s plan is to seek the support of fellow members of the \r\nSouth Pacific Forum and other regional groups to which we belong or with \r\nwhich, like the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), we have close \r\nand cordial relations, to raise the proposal for consideration by members of \r\nthe Group of 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement, and to discuss it on a bilateral \r\nbasis as widely as we can with a view to submitting a resolution to the \r\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. We would hope to see a panel appointed \r\nin time to present a report during the forty-ninth session of the General \r\nAssembly, and to have it debated in 1995. \r\nLike many other countries represented in this Assembly, Papua New Guinea \r\ninherited many of its economic, legal and other arrangements from abroad. Many \r\nof the practices, policies and laws followed in the monetary sector of our \r\nnational economy were originally devised in different conditions, by different \r\npeople and to serve different objectives. \r\nWe believe that we have not exhausted - or even considered all \r\npractical policy or legal options for facilitating economic participation by \r\nour citizens in either national or international affairs. We have not had \r\nready and systematic access to experiences elsewhere. \r\nWe do not believe that market forces on their own will necessarily allow \r\nour people adequate opportunities to participate in and benefit from economic \r\ndevelopment without further change. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n24 \r\n(Mr. Kaputin, \r\nPapua New Guinea) \r\nFurther options need to be identified and further changes will have to be \r\nmade if people seeking to participate in economic development from the \r\nbaseline at which most people in developing countries start are to be able to \r\nidentify, utilize and benefit from the opportunities which are more often in \r\ntheory than in practice available to them. We want to learn what the \r\noptions are. \r\nMy Government will, therefore, be looking to other Members of the United \r\nNations for support and ideas to advance our proposal. The result will, we \r\nhope, be an important, practical guide to options for creating, maintaining, \r\ndiversifying and/or enlarging opportunities for economic participation, with \r\nparticular reference to developinq countries. \r\nMy Government has recently found itself being criticized, for the first \r\ntime, before the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva and the \r\nJoint Assembly of the African, Caribbean and Pacific signatories of the Lome \r\nConvention and the European Economic Community over human rights abuses in the \r\nNorth Solomons Province of Papua New Guinea. \r\nIt gives me no pleasure to say, even though it is true, that most of the \r\nabuses, for which parties on all sides of the conflict must accept some \r\nresponsibility, occurred while a previous Government was in office, and that \r\nmy colleagues and I opposed them at the time. As members of the present \r\nGovernment, we are now responsible for resolvinq the situation, whatever its \r\ncauses. We must accept responsibility for what we decide or condone from now \r\non. But the situation which gave rise to the criticism to which I have \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n25 \r\n(Mr. Kaputin, \r\nPapua New Guinea) \r\nreferred owes much to economic practices, policies and laws which were devised \r\nwith little or no regard for popular participation, and with even less regard \r\nfor the particular characteristics of the societies in which most of the \r\npeople in the area continue to live. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n26 \r\n(Mr. Kaputin. Papua New Guinea) \r\nIt also highlights the need to recognize that processes which might help \r\nalleviate tensions and reduce conflicts in some parts of the world might not \r\nhave the same effects in others. They might, in fact, only make matters worse. \r\nFor Papua New Guinea, as for many other developing countries which have \r\nbecome independent since the Second World War, nation-building remains a \r\ndifficult problem and a pressing concern. The issue for us is not, as it is \r\nelsewhere, to find ways of managing ethnic and other tensions now that the \r\nideological and technological weight of the cold war has been lifted from \r\npreviously subject peoples, but rather to reconcile differences within and \r\nharness them to a common, national cause. \r\nFurthermore, my Government has taken the view that dealing with human \r\nrights on their own is often not to the point. It can, in fact, be irrelevant \r\nand can even actively contribute to further suffering. \r\nMy Government has, therefore, admitted that wrongs have been committed by \r\nparticipants on all sides of the conflict in Papua New Guinea\u0027s North Solomons \r\nProvince. It has taken steps to ensure that they cease and are not repeated \r\nand has invited other Governments and international organizations to help \r\nredress them by contributing, for example, to the costs of assessing needs, \r\nplanning rehabilitation and restoring services to people who have suffered \r\nwithout them. \r\nMy Government believes that Papua New Guineans are best placed to resolve \r\nthe conflict; but we look to others for help in rehabilitating people, \r\nrepairing damage and restoring services. \r\nMy Government intends to be among the concerned participants in the \r\nsecond world conference on human rights, scheduled for June 1993. As was done \r\nat the tenth Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement, we reaffirm the \r\nuniversality of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms, which are \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n27 \r\n(Mr. Kaputin. Papua New Guinea) \r\nembodied in the Papua New Guinea Constitution. But, like other members of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, we believe that economic and social progress facilitates \r\nthe achievement of such rights and freedoms, which is why I have emphasized \r\neconomic opportunity and participation. For similar reasons we welcome the \r\nbroad scope proposed for the world conference on women in 1995, which focuses \r\non action in the context of equality, development and peace. \r\nAs an active participant in the work of the Fourth Committee of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Committee of 24, my Government is a strong supporter \r\nof the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism (1990-2000). \r\nWe therefore look forward to hosting a Pacific regional seminar on \r\ndecolonization in Port Moresby in 1993 in order to help further the plan of \r\naction for the Decade. \r\nIn our immediate region, we continue to support United Nations \r\ninvolvement in the decolonization of New Caledonia and trust that the outcome \r\nof the forthcoming mid-term review of the implementation of the Matignon \r\nAccords will lead to further progress towards safeguarding the legitimate \r\nrights of the Kanaks. \r\nAs far as other developments in the South Pacific are concerned, we \r\nwelcome the French Government\u0027s decision to suspend its nuclear-weapon-testing \r\nprogramme in French Polynesia. We urge that it be ended for good. \r\nWe look to the Government of the United States of America to honour \r\nPresident Bush\u0027s promise to limit the use of Johnston Atoll for disposing of \r\nweapons which were never directed at us while they were active but which now \r\nthreaten our safety, health and economic welfare. \r\nWe seek assurances that the Pacific Ocean will not be used to transport \r\nplutonium or other hazardous nuclear, chemical or biological materials which \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n28 \r\n(Mr. Kaputin. Papua New Guinea) \r\nmight pollute the seas on which we rely. Promises that every precaution will \r\nbe taken are simply not enough. \r\nLike the Governments of other South Pacific island countries, we are \r\nsympathetic to the aspirations of those who favour increased regional economic \r\ncooperation in Europe and North America. We support efforts to assist former \r\ncommunist States in the immense task of economic and social reconstruction \r\nwhich lies ahead. But, like the Governments of other developing countries, we \r\nin the South Pacific are concerned that regional integration and efforts to \r\nmeet needs in other parts of the world should not proceed at the expense of \r\nthe needs of our people. \r\nWe are also concerned that the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on \r\nTariffs and Trade (GATT) be brought to an early conclusion, with due regard \r\nfor the need to secure and expand opportunities for the economic participation \r\nof developing countries in the international economy. It is, in fact, \r\nprecisely because we believe that opportunities for economic participation \r\nshould be greater and more equitably distributed than they have been that my \r\nGovernment has proposed the initiative I have previously outlined. \r\nMy Government supports the active role being taken by the United Nations, \r\nin difficult circumstances, to ensure peace and to bring about a return to \r\nnormalcy in Cambodia. We also support efforts to secure peace in Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina and to facilitate relief efforts in Somalia. We are heartened by \r\nwhat we have heard from the Governments of Israel and neighbouring States \r\nconcerning the prospects for a negotiated settlement of outstanding sources of \r\nconflict in the Middle East. \r\nWe are cautiously hopeful about the prospects for a democratic, \r\nnon-racial South Africa. But, as the situation now stands, my Government \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n29-30 \r\n(Mr. Kaputin. Papu? \"\"« Guinea) \r\nbelieves that it should maintain existing bans on all dealings with South \r\nAfrica, continue to monitor developments there closely and consider relaxing \r\nthose bans only as further progress occurs in the desired direction and in \r\nclose consultation with African States. \r\nLike our predecessors, my Government supports efforts to limit the \r\nproduction and sale of arms. We believe that unwanted foreign military forces \r\nshould be removed from countries which do not pose a threat to their \r\nneighbours or to international law. \r\nHowever, coming as I do from a developing country, I feel it important to \r\nrepeat that we need to acknowledge the reality, recognized also in the report \r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\", that there are non-military threats to peace which are \r\nperhaps becoming more obvious than ever before. My Government agrees with the \r\nobservation made in the report that there is a need to strengthen arrangements \r\nto identify, monitor, synthesize information about and act collectively to \r\navert, reduce and limit such threats, with sensitivity to local circumstances, \r\nincluding the interests of well-intentioned States, and with full regard for \r\ninternational law. \r\nI cannot help noticing not only how the membership and the agenda of the \r\nGeneral Assembly have changed in recent years but also how the content, tone \r\nand frankness with regard to domestic difficulties, and even the length of \r\ncontributions to the general debate, have changed, and generally for the \r\nbetter. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n31 \r\n(Mr. Kaputin. Papua New Guinea) \r\nAs head of my country\u0027s delegation, I have had the privilege of listening \r\nto delegations from newly admitted Member States make use of the opportunity \r\nto participate in the General Assembly on their own account for the first \r\ntime. I trust that other Governments will see fit to support my proposal for \r\na United Nations-sponsored initiative to prepare and discuss a detailed report \r\non how best to go about the task complementary to securing increased \r\nopportunities for political participation of securing increased \r\nopportunities for economic participation, with particular reference to needs \r\nin and of developing countries. Opportunity and participation are the keys to \r\npolitical development, security and peace. They are also the keys to economic \r\ndevelopment and justice, including equity between, and within, the northern \r\nand southern parts of the globe. \r\nADDRESS BY MR. MAXIME CARLOT KORMAN, PRIME MINISTER OF THE REPUBLIC OF \r\nVANUATU \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Vanuatu. \r\nMr. Maxime Carlot Korman. Prime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have great pleasure in welcoming the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Vanuatu, His Excellency \r\nthe Honourable Maxime Carlot Korman, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\nMr. CARLOT KORMAN (Vanuatu) (interpretation from French): I join in \r\nthe congratulations extended to you. Sir, on your election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-seventh session. Your election symbolizes the \r\ngreat changes taking place throughout the world, and is a tribute to your \r\ncountry and to your people, as well as to you yourself. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n32 \r\n(Mr. Carlot Kormanr Vanuatu) \r\nI should also like to pay a special tribute to you your predecessor, \r\nMr. Samir Shihabi, the former Permanent Representative of Saudi Arabia, for \r\nthe manner in which he presided over the affairs of the General Assembly \r\nduring its forty-sixth session. \r\nThere can be no doubt that there has been no period in our lifetime when \r\nthe world has enjoyed greater hope for a lasting international peace than it \r\ndoes now. The gradual reduction of tension and the eventual elimination of \r\nantagonisms between the world\u0027s two foremost military Powers have had dramatic \r\nresults in nuclear disarmament, and ultimately contributed to the end of the \r\ncold war. Today, the widening circle of democracy holds out the promise of an \r\ninternational environment that could become even more conducive to the \r\nattainment of international peace and security. \r\nNone the less, many problems persist and plague the Earth, threatening \r\nour never-ending search for justice, equality and peace. Democracy, so \r\ncherished and championed, within certain national borders, is often less \r\ncherished, if not disregarded, when it comes to the interests of the large and \r\npowerful countries, on the one hand, and those of the smaller and economically \r\nweaker States, on the other. \r\nMoreover, nationalism, which could, and should, be a progressive vehicle \r\nfor unifying peoples, rather than dividing them, has on occasion been \r\nencouraged to manifest its narrowest and most intolerant forms. In too many \r\nparts of the world, old ethnic antagonisms have been reawakened and are being \r\nexploited by demagogues who are very adept at using these antagonisms to serve \r\ntheir selfish and short-sighted ambitions. Unfortunately, far too often the \r\nvictims of this demagoguery have no recourse to any legal mechanism that might \r\nspare their lives and end their suffering. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n33 \r\n(Mr. Carlot Korman. Vanuatu) \r\nTragically, we have seen certain scenarios played out far too often. At \r\nfirst, the world sits idly by and barely notices the insulting words and the \r\noffensive speeches that are made. Then, even more inflammatory rhetoric is \r\nspouted, and eventually stones are hurled. Next, individuals are assaulted in \r\nthe streets and their homes are invaded and vandalized. Before too long, \r\nconditions deteriorate irreparably. \r\nFor some, that constitutes a point of no return. Ignorance, which breeds \r\nhatred, accelerates and races forward unchecked, building its own momentum \r\nwith ever-increasing destructive force. Entire neighbourhoods or villages are \r\nplaced under siege. The demagogues, by now totally intoxicated by the false \r\npower of the forces they have unleashed, will always try to claim to be \r\ndefending the loftiest ideals. In fact, they are simply following their \r\nbasest instincts. \r\nVanuatu has long been disturbed by the hesitancy and reluctance of some \r\nmembers of the international community to address this very troublesome \r\nissue. In the past we have warned that failure to examine the causes of \r\nethnic antagonisms or intercommunal conflicts, failure to devise peaceful ways \r\nto resolve them, could only lead to a situation in which, one day, \r\ninternational peace and security would be quite seriously threatened by such \r\ndevelopments. Regrettably, that day has now arrived. Thus, while some of us \r\nhave never had more reason to rejoice and others have never had more reason to \r\nmourn, still others have never faced a less certain future. \r\nWhat possible joy can a mother in the Balkans feel when she buries her \r\nyoung son whose life was ended by an unknown sniper\u0027s bullet? What possible \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n34-35 \r\n(Mr. Carlot Korman. Vanuatu) \r\njoy can a father in Somalia feel when he watches his daughter die a slow and \r\npainful death from starvation? What can possibly ease the terror that fills \r\nthe hearts of defenceless and innocent refugees who find themselves caught in \r\nthe vice of political and social indifference or who behold the chaos in \r\nnative lands they had always considered havens of justice and equality. \r\nWhile some rightly rejoice over the end of the cold war and the spread of \r\ndemocracy, others are homeless and continue to suffer the pangs of hunger \r\noften the result of economic deprivation. Still others mourn the sudden and \r\nviolent end of the lives of their loved ones and wonder anxiously whether they \r\nthemselves will survive to see the next sunrise. While some are able to \r\napplaud what has been achieved, others can only contemplate the long road \r\nstill to be travelled. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n36 \r\n(Mr. Carlot Korman. Vanuatu) \r\nFrom South Africa to Afghanistan, from Cambodia to Haiti, from Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina to East Timor, from the heart of Europe all the way to the sunny \r\nSouth Pacific, people are suffering some for a long time now because of \r\nthe difficulties of all kinds that they face, and the international community \r\nmust still shoulder the major responsibility. \r\nAll these ideas are emphasized in the Secretary-General\u0027s remarkable \r\nreport entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\". He has made a thought-provoking \r\nanalysis, and we find this document to be a very good starting-point for \r\nmuch-needed discussions as we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the United \r\nNations and as mankind prepares to enter the twenty-first century. \r\nThe international political environment is not the only environment that \r\nconcerns us. Much has been written and much has been said about the Earth \r\nSummit held this past June in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It remains to be seen \r\nwhat will be done as a follow-up to that very important meeting. \r\nWe are pleased to note that some very positive measures have already been \r\ntaken. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is to be commended for \r\nhaving made a significant financial contribution to Capacity 21. Canada has \r\nindicated that it will follow suit. We trust that others also will do so very \r\nsoon. This important initiative will help the developing countries formulate \r\nnational policies and legislation in support of the environment and \r\nsustainable development. It will focus on the technical training of human \r\nresources and the strengthening of regional and national institutions. More \r\nimportantly, it will show how serious the developed countries of the North are \r\nabout the extensive multilateral commitments necessary to breathe life into \r\nour post-Rio journey. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Carlot Korman. Vanuatu) \r\nAt this session of the General Assembly a number of important measures \r\nshould be taken as follow-ups to the Earth Summit. Among these, of course, is \r\nthe establishment of a high-level commission on sustainable development. It \r\nis our hope that the commission\u0027s secretariat will be situated at United \r\nNations Headquarters here in New York and that the commission will meet in New \r\nYork so that all countries will have an opportunity to participate in, and \r\ncontribute to, the commission\u0027s important work. Situating the commission\u0027s \r\nsecretariat elsewhere and holding its meetings outside New York would without \r\nany doubt result in sharply reduced participation by a large number of \r\ndeveloping countries and would limit the commission\u0027s effectiveness. \r\nFurthermore, we feel that situating the commission in New York would be most \r\ncost-effective for the United Nations and would stimulate the very necessary \r\ninteraction between the commission, UNDP, the United Nations Population Fund \r\n(UNFPA), the World Bank and the other multilateral agencies that are so \r\nessential to making the follow-up to Rio meaningful and effective. \r\nWe strongly believe, as do our colleagues in the Alliance of Small Island \r\nStates (AOSIS), that the decisions made with respect to the site of the \r\ncommission\u0027s secretariat, the venue of its meetings, its size and its \r\ncomposition will be critical in determining whether there will be universal \r\nparticipation and transparency in the work of the commission. Our major \r\nconcern is that this matter not be decided on any ground except what is likely \r\nto lead to the most effective functioning of the commission and its productive \r\ninteraction with other agencies. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n38 \r\n(Mr. Carlot Korman, Vanuatu) \r\nDuring the current session of the General Assembly, an intergovernmental \r\ncommittee to negotiate a convention on drought and desertification will also \r\nbe established. Vanuatu intends to participate actively in that committee\u0027s \r\nwork and to lend its support to those countries most immediately threatened by \r\ndrought and desertification. We feel that addressing this problem is one of \r\nthe greatest challenges facing the international community. \r\nAnother of the very important measures the General Assembly will consider \r\nas a follow-up to the Earth Summit is the proposal to hold a world conference \r\non the sustainable development of the small island States. Such a meeting is \r\nlong overdue. We hope a resolution on convening the conference will be \r\nadopted by consensus and that the essential objective of the conference, which \r\nAOSIS is proposing be held in Barbados, will be to ensure concrete and \r\nmeaningful action by the international community to assist the world\u0027s most \r\nvulnerable, yet very frequently overlooked, countries. We appeal to all \r\ncountries to lend their support to this conference and to join us in the warm \r\nand friendly atmosphere of Barbados next June in order to continue our journey \r\ntogether on the road charted by the Rio Conference. \r\nVanuatu is not only a small island State but also a least developed \r\ncountry. We therefore have a real concern for our economy as well as for \r\npolitical democracy. Thus, we aspire also to economic development. \r\nTherefore, we join in the appeals for measures to correct the trade \r\nimbalances, to reduce the debt burden, and to establish fair prices for our \r\ncommodities. We believe that measures must be taken to overcome these \r\nscourges of underdevelopment. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n39-40 \r\n(Mr. Carlot Korman. Vanuatu) \r\nThis subject is of such great importance that we approach the question of \r\nthe reform and restructuring of the United Nations development system with a \r\ngreat deal of hope that creative approaches will be devised and effectively \r\nutilized in the post-cold-war period. \r\nWe are pleased and proud to report that next month our Parliament in \r\nVanuatu will act on legislation required for the ratification of the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the Convention on \r\nBiological Diversity. We strongly feel it is essential that these conventions \r\nbe ratified, enter into force and be strictly adhered to at the earliest \r\npossible moment. \r\nWe are also pleased that there is finally a convention banning chemical \r\nweapons. We pray that those who possess such weapons and those who would \r\npossess them will see the wisdom of becoming parties to that legal \r\ninstrument and forever banning those horrible tools of death. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n41 \r\n(Mr. Carlot Korman. Vanuatu) \r\nEnvironmental disasters that have recently struck countries as diverse \r\nand geographically distant from each other as the Bahamas, France, Nicaragua, \r\nPakistan and the United States suggest that the world has not a moment to \r\nspare if we are to avoid the potential global calamity that could result from \r\nmankind\u0027s long-term abuse of the environment. Precautionary, preventive \r\nmeasures should be taken now; otherwise it will most assuredly be too late. \r\nFor decades, the peoples of the South Pacific have seen their region \r\nutilized for the testing of nuclear weapons, for the dumping of radioactive \r\nwastes and, most recently, for the destruction of chemical weapons. Our \r\nregion paid high and unwanted costs for technologies from which we received \r\ncomparatively little benefit. Today, we South Pacific leaders are very \r\nconcerned about plans to ship plutonium through our waters. We trust that \r\nthose who are involved in these plans will heed our voices while we still have \r\nvoices to be heard. \r\nI conclude by joining in the welcome that has been expressed to all of \r\nour new Members. Theirs has not been an easy path to statehood, international \r\nrecognition and membership of the United Nations. We salute their \r\nperseverance and their vision of their own futures. We stand ready to join \r\nhands with them in forging a more effective, more representative and more \r\nresponsive United Nations. In that way we shall help to create a more \r\ndemocratic international order a world order that is democratic in fact as \r\nwell as in word; a world order that respects all countries, whether large and \r\npowerful or small and vulnerable. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n42 \r\nThp PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe Prime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\nMr. Maxime Carlot Korman. Prime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: We have heard the last speaker in the general debate. \r\nSTATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT \r\nThe PRESIDENT: It was my sincere intention to listen to every one \r\nof the 167 speeches made during the general debate, but at times my duties as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly engaged me elsewhere. None the less, we \r\nhave all been privileged to listen to 24 Heads of State, one Vice-President, \r\n13 Prime Ministers, 10 deputy Prime Ministers, 103 Foreign Ministers and \r\n16 Chairmen of Delegation. \r\nThe current session of the General Assembly is taking place at a crucial \r\nmoment in the history of the United Nations. It is a time of unprecedented \r\nopportunities, following the end of the cold war. But it is also a period of \r\nsober assessment as we consider the new and complex problems facing the \r\nOrganization and the world. \r\nAfter three weeks of general debate in the Assembly, I take great \r\npleasure in noting that one of the most significant features evidenced in the \r\nstatements is the need to make the United Nations truly effective and swiftly \r\nresponsive in meeting the challenges of a rapidly changing world. The \r\nstatements made in the general debate provided evidence of this changing world \r\nas they set forth a multidimensional view of virtually every major \r\ninternational problem. Moreover, these statements reflected a cohesion of \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n43 \r\n(The President) \r\nideas regarding the critical need for reform in the United Nations, including \r\nthe General Assembly. A strong impetus for future reform is to be found in \r\nthe commendable report \"An Agenda for Peace\" of the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. \r\nIt is not incidental that, following the general debate, the first item \r\nwe shall take up and we shall do so on Friday - is, in part, the \"Agenda for \r\nPeace\", and we shall then address the significant issues raised throughout the \r\ngeneral debate about the future of this forum and its enhanced effectiveness. \r\nThe general debate has again demonstrated the unique role the General \r\nAssembly plays, and has proved how important it is that we should realize its \r\nfull potential as an unprecedented world parliament. One of the most \r\nimportant tasks of this forum is to ensure preventive diplomacy and \r\npeacemaking activities, thus safeguarding social and economic conditions for \r\nall in this changed world. \r\nIt is my sincere hope that the resolutions to be adopted in the months \r\nahead will not only result in concrete action but also comprise appropriate \r\nmechanisms for supervision of their implementation. \r\nIn conclusion, I should like to take this opportunity to express my \r\nsincere thanks to all those representatives who, in addressing the Assembly, \r\nmade generous references to my country and to me personally. \r\nMay I take it now that it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude \r\nits consideration of agenda item 9? \r\nIt was so decided. \r\nA/47/PV.30 \r\n44-45 \r\nPROGRAMME OF WORK \r\nThe PRESIDENT: May I remind representatives that tomorrow we shall \r\nbegin discussion of agenda item 10, entitled \"Report of the Secretary-General \r\non the work of the Organization\", which includes the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\nreport \"An Agenda for Peace\". \r\nI should also like to remind members that we shall begin the meeting \r\npunctually at 10 a.m. \r\nThe meeting rose at 12.10 p.m. \r\n"
