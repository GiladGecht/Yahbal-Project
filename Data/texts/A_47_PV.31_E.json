"NITED \r\nATIONS \r\nm General Assembly PROVISIONAL A/47/PV.31 \r\n22 October 1992 \r\nENGLISH \r\nForty-seventh session \r\nGENERAL ASSEMBLY \r\nPROVISIONAL VERBATIM RECORD OF THE 31st MEETING \r\nHeld at Headquarters, New York, \r\non Friday, 9 October 1992, at 10 a.m. \r\nPresident: M r . GANEV \r\n(President) \r\n(Bulgaria) \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the organization: \r\nreports of the Secretary-General [10] \r\nThis record contains the original text of speeches delivered in English \r\nand interpretations of speeches in the other languages. The final text will \r\nbe printed in the Official Records of the General Assembly. \r\nCorrections should be submitted to original speeches only. They should \r\nbe sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned, within \r\none week, to the Chief, Official Records Editing Section, Office of Conference \r\nServices, room DC2-750, 2 United Nations Plaza, and incorporated in a copy of \r\nthe record. \r\n92-61388 1737V (E) \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n2-5 \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10:20 a.m. \r\nAGENDA ITEM 10 \r\nREPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ON THE WORK OF THE ORGANIZATION: REPORTS OF \r\nTHE SECRETARY-GENERAL (A/47/1, A/47/277) \r\nThe PRESIDENT: This morning the General Assembly will consider \r\nagenda item 10, entitled \"Report of the Secretary-General on the Work of the \r\nOrganization\" (A/47/1), including the report of the Secretary-General entitled \r\n\"An Agenda for Peace preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping\" \r\n(A/47/277). \r\nIt is my hope that we shall have an energetic, creative and fruitful \r\ndiscussion fully realizing the potential of this item and of this forum, the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\nSir David HANNAY (United Kingdom): I should like to begin by simply \r\nsaying how much the European Community and its member States, on whose behalf \r\nI am speaking, welcome the initiative that you. Sir, as President have taken \r\nto have two days of debate on this particular issue, that is to say, the \r\nfollow-up - in our view the action-oriented follow-up required to the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report on \"An Agenda for Peace\". \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n6 \r\n(Sir David Hannay. United \r\nKingdom) \r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General\u0027s report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/47/1) in general, his wider report, and I should say at the outset that we \r\nare encouraged by the commitment he has made to restructuring the \r\nSecretariat. We also welcome the Secretary-General\u0027s emphasis on the work of \r\nthe United Nations in the fields of economic and social development as well as \r\nthose of peace and security. But in this statement this morning I intend to \r\nfocus on his report \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277). \r\nAs Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, speaking on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Community, said in the general debate, the Community and its member \r\nStates warmly welcome the Secretary-General\u0027s report and thank him and his \r\nstaff for all their efforts in preparing it. We attach importance to the \r\nrequest for the report, which was made in the presidential statement that was \r\nagreed at the Summit Meeting of the Security Council on 31 January. The \r\nEuropean Community and its member States submitted an informal contribution to \r\nthe Secretary-General while the report was being prepared and we were \r\nencouraged by how much common ground there was between the contribution we \r\nmade and the eventual report. \r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s report is a comprehensive step towards \r\nstrengthening the United Nations. It is wide-ranging and contains a wealth of \r\ninteresting ideas. We welcome the widest possible discussion of them. We \r\nlistened with interest to the preliminary views of delegations expressed in \r\nthe Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations in August and to the views \r\nexpressed by those Heads of State and Government and Foreign Ministers who \r\nparticipated in the general debate which has just finished. We are pleased \r\nthat the Security Council has carried out some preliminary work to identify \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n7 \r\n(Sir David Hannay. United \r\nKingdom) \r\nthose parts of the Secretary-General\u0027s report which are of interest to it and \r\nwe look forward to that work progressing in as action-oriented a way as the \r\nwork in the Assembly. \r\nOn preventive diplomacy first: it is a statement of the obvious that \r\npreventive diplomacy is more useful to people about to be embroiled in \r\nconflict than the most successful peace-keeping or peacemaking operation. It \r\nis less costly in terms of lives and cash and we therefore believe that the \r\nSecretary-General should be ready to make full use of his powers under \r\nArticle 99 of the Charter to draw the attention of the Security Council to any \r\nmatter which in his opinion may threaten international peace and security. To \r\ndo so the Secretary-General should make full use of the Secretariat\u0027s \r\ninformation-gathering capabilities and seek to improve them. The Secretariat \r\nshould continue to gather and evaluate all relevant information originating \r\nfrom all parts of the United Nations system around the world and from Member \r\nStates. In this regard we are in favour of confidence-building measures and \r\nendorse the greater use of fact-finding missions as proposed in the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report and as practised by the Secretary-General in recent \r\nweeks. We recall the Assembly\u0027s declaration last year on fact-finding, which \r\nwas initiated by members of the European Community. The recent fact-finding \r\nmissions to Moldova, Nagorno-Karabakh, Tajikstan and Georgia have already made \r\na valuable contribution. But one has to recognize the fact that the success \r\nof preventive diplomacy depends also on the political will of the parties \r\ninvolved or about to be involved in a conflict. \r\nThe Secretary-General suggests that the time has come to consider \r\npreventive deployments of troops when so requested, to deter aggression or \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n8 \r\n(Sir David Hannay. United \r\nKingdom) \r\nconflict between States, possibly involving deployment to only one side of an \r\ninternational boundary. There may be timing and other difficulties about the \r\ndispatch of such a force in a given crisis, but essentially we believe that \r\nthis is a sound idea which should be followed up on a case-by-case basis. In \r\nsome cases it may also be useful to establish a demilitarized zone with the \r\nconsent of the parties as a preventive measure in advance of a risk of \r\nconflict. \r\nWe also see merit in the idea of preventive deployment in the event of an \r\ninternal crisis, when help with humanitarian assistance or conciliation is \r\nrequested. The failure to take such measures in the cases Of Somalia and \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina are clear cases that remind us of the need for such \r\npreventive action. Of course no two cases would be the same. Before any \r\ndeployment there would need to be careful discussion with the Governments and \r\nparties concerned. Recognizing that, the European Community and its member \r\nStates have already decided in principle to send civilian monitoring missions \r\nI \r\nto States which want them where this would help to avert a crisis and \r\npossible bloodshed. In South Africa with the agreement of all parties, the \r\nII \r\nUnited Nations, the European Community and the Commonwealth are all sending \r\ni \r\nobservers to reinforce the domestic peace mechanism. \r\nI should like now to speak a little about peacemaking. The European \r\nCommunity and its member States believe that, as the Secretary-General \r\n1 suggests, the United Nations should put an increased effort into peacemaking \r\nby taking advantage of the provisions of the Charter for dispute settlement. \r\nIn this regard, the European Community and its member States fully share the \r\nobservation of the Secretary-General that the Security Council may, under \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n9 \r\n(Sir David Hannav. United \r\nKingdom) \r\nArticles 36 and 37 of the Charter, recommend to Member States the submission \r\nof a dispute to the International Court of Justice, or arbitration, or other \r\ndispute-settlement mechanisms. \r\nIn connection with Article 50 of the Charter, we are acutely aware of the \r\neconomic difficulties often caused to third countries by the imposition of \r\nsanctions under Chapter VII. Countries which need balance-of-payments help \r\nand which are also implementing prudent adjustment programmes are being \r\nadversely affected. The international financial institutions are well placed \r\nto assess and then take into account the effects of United Nations mandatory \r\nsanctions when they design support packages for these countries. This \r\nquestion is also currently being examined in the Charter Committee and we look \r\nforward to contributing constructively to the outcome. \r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s report contains a number of proposals for Member \r\nStates to earmark forces for enforcement action and for peace-keeping. One \r\nmember of the European Community has already offered to make 1000 troops \r\navailable at 48 hours\u0027 notice and another 1000 within one week. \r\nOn peace-keeping: so far as peace-keeping operations are concerned the \r\nmember countries of the European Community are currently providing more than \r\n14,000 peace-keepers and this will increase with the deployment of the second \r\npart of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPR0F0R) in Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina. All the Twelve have responded to the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\nquestionnaire on forces that could be made available for peace-keeping \r\noperations and all member States will keep this under regular review. The \r\nTwelve believe it would also be useful if the Secretariat could update the \r\nquestionnaire and issue a similar one on civilian police and other civilian \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n10 \r\n(Sir David Hannay. United \r\nKingdom) \r\npersonnel who might be made available for peace-keeping operations. There \r\nshould be, in our view, must greater contact between the military and defence \r\nestablishments of Member States and the Secretariat to clarify what support \r\nmight be needed and what might be available, to pave the way for possible \r\nfuture agreements between the United Nations and individual Member States. \r\nThe Twelve therefore stand ready to make troops available for peace-keeping \r\noperations. \r\nThe European Community and its member States recall that the Special \r\nCommittee on Peace-keeping Operations has made interesting recommendations \r\nwhich have been adopted by the General Assembly in recent years. Many of \r\nthese have concerned training for United Nations peace-keepers. Like the \r\nSecretary-General, we are keen to see improved training for peace-keeping \r\npersonnel. We welcome the strengthening of the Department of Peace-keeping \r\nAffairs and the proposed augmentation of the strength and capability of the \r\nMilitary Adviser\u0027s office. Given the increasing role of civilian police in \r\npeace-keeping operations, consideration should be given to the appointment of \r\na Senior Police Adviser to the Secretary-General. We also commend the idea in \r\nthe Secretary-General\u0027s report that Governments should keep appropriate \r\nequipment on stand-by for use by the United Nations. This should help ease \r\nthe problems that often arise in the early phases of the deployment of a \r\npeace-keeping operation. \r\nThe role of the United Nations does not stop once a conflict is over. \r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s report \"An Agenda for Peace\" rightly looks at how we \r\nmight help in peace-building after a conflict. The United Nations is making a \r\ncrucial contribution, for example in El Salvador, in Angola and in Cambodia, \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n10(a-z) \r\n(Sir David Hannay. United \r\nKingdom) \r\nand we look forward to its being able to do so very soon in Mozambique. The \r\npromotion of free elections and democratic institutions is a key part of such \r\npeace-building and a proper area of activity for the United Nations. So, at a \r\npractical level, is the removal of mines. It is a stern commentary on the \r\nstate of the world that the removal of mines in the aftermath of conflict is \r\nso high on our agenda, and must be so. In Cambodia, Afghanistan, Somalia and \r\nAngola this problem is a dramatic one. We therefore welcome the appointment \r\nof a de-mining expert on the Military Adviser\u0027s staff. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n11 \r\n(Sir David Hannay. United Kingdom) \r\nClearly, the fostering of sound economic and social development in areas \r\ntorn by conflict is an essential part of reconstruction and peace- building. \r\nEqually, as the Secretary-General says, good governance must be promoted. The \r\nabsence of democratic and pluralistic internal structures is a source of \r\npolitical and economic instability which may well result in a threat to \r\ninternational peace and security. The exercise of sovereignty involves \r\ninternal and external responsibilities. Sovereignty cannot be used as a \r\ngeneral cover for systematic human-rights violations, in particular when such \r\nviolations take the form of internal repression and threaten international \r\npeace and stability. The European Community and its member States have \r\nunderlined that all Governments are accountable to the international community \r\nfor the observance of those obligations they have freely assumed. There \r\ncannot be arguments about interference in their internal affairs to avoid \r\ncriticism for failure to meet those international obligations. \r\nThe European Community and its member States welcome the emphasis the \r\nSecretary-General gives to human rights, democracy and development. We want \r\nthe World Conference on Human Rights at Vienna in June 1993 to take real steps \r\nto achieve this. It could support and reinforce efforts of individual \r\ncountries to promote democracy, respect for human rights and accountability at \r\nall levels. We also look forward to the adoption of the declaration on the \r\nrights of persons belonging to minorities at this session of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\nThe European Community and its member States warmly welcome the tide of \r\npolitical reform now flowing in many parts of the world. We are playing \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n12 \r\n(Sir David Hannay. United Kingdom) \r\nour part in furthering this. Europe, both at the national and the Community \r\nlevel, has already shown its readiness to respond to requests for assistance \r\nin election-monitoring in a number of countries. \r\nWe have noted that a major theme in the Secretary-General\u0027s report is \r\nthe role that can be played by regional organizations in problems of \r\ninternational peace and security. We commend this idea. In many situations a \r\nbigger and more effective role can be played by the relevant regional \r\norganizations in coordination with the United Nations. We welcome the \r\nincreasing trend for regional organizations to do more in respect of both \r\npeace-keeping and peacemaking, and we look forward to the continued \r\ndevelopment of this trend. We hope that in the future the Conference on \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) will be effective in the prevention \r\nof conflict throughout Europe. With the adoption of the Helsinki Document the \r\nCSCE has begun to give itself the tools to tackle problems by conciliation and \r\narbitration before they slide into violence, and to manage crises once they \r\ndevelop; this includes the possibility of CSCE peace-keeping operations. The \r\nHelsinski Document adopted in July recognizes that the CSCE is a regional \r\narrangement, according to Chapter VIII of the Charter, and thus provides an \r\nimportant link between European and global security. \r\nThe European Community Monitoring Mission is soon to extend its \r\nactivities beyond the former Yugoslavia to the borders between the former \r\nYugoslavia and Hungary, Bulgaria and Albania. In our view this is precisely \r\nthe sort of area in which regional organizations can make a major \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n13 \r\n(Sir David Hannay. United Kingdom) \r\ncontribution, in collaboration and coordination with the United Nations, to \r\ntackle potential threats to international peace and security. \r\nCooperation between the European Community Monitoring Mission and the \r\nUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the field has been close. It is \r\nnow paralleled at the very highest political level in the Conference on the \r\nformer Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which the Secretary- General \r\nand Prime Minister Major co-chaired in September, and which is now continuing \r\nin Geneva. \r\nWe note the Secretary-General\u0027s comments on the vital issue of the \r\nsafety of peace-keeping personnel. There may be cases where it would be \r\nuseful for the Security Council to warn the parties before deployment that \r\ncollective measures will be considered if United Nations personnel are \r\nattacked or the purposes of a United Nations operation are frustrated. We \r\ntake this opportunity to reiterate our call to all host countries and all \r\nparties to a conflict to do everything possible to ensure the safety of United \r\nNations peace-keeping personnel and to respect their international status. We \r\nalso pay tribute to the men and women who are serving in peace-keeping \r\noperations in the field, and to those who have served in the past. They often \r\nserve in difficult and dangerous conditions, and, tragically, some have lost \r\ntheir lives in the service of peace - 29 this year alone. And if I may be \r\npermitted a personal remark at this point, I would say that it is high time \r\nthe Organization found some way to mark in a memorial the names of those whose \r\nlives have been lost on behalf of the United Nations. \r\nThe European Community member States make a substantial financial as \r\nwell as military contribution to peace-keeping operations. The figures speak \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n14 \r\n(Sir David Hannay. United Kingdom) \r\nfor themselves. Twelve member States of the European Community are supposed \r\nto contribute one third of the cost of peace-keeping operations as financed \r\nthrough assessed contributions. At the end of August this year these 12 \r\ncountries had in fact given 40.1 per cent of the actual contributions \r\ncollected so far for the various new operations launched or expanded since the \r\nend of the previous General Assembly session. In fact, the true costs of \r\npeace-keeping considerably exceed that figure. Those European Community \r\nmember States participating in the new operations in Bosnia will do so, \r\nexceptionally, at no cost to the United Nations. And as Mr. Hurd, speaking on \r\nbehalf of the European Community and its member States, said in the general \r\ndebate, we are doing our bit; we look to others to do the same. \r\nThe Secretary-General is quite right to say that the financial problems \r\nof the United Nations must not be allowed to fester. Nearly two thirds of the \r\nmembership are behind in their payments. And it is particularly unfortunate \r\nthat these include major contributors. The Organization\u0027s ability to \r\nintervene is critically dependent in the short term on the availability of \r\nfinancial resources. We therefore support the proposed peace-keeping reserve \r\nfund, subject to negotiation on the detail. The detailed arrangements in this \r\ncase are for the Fifth Committee and the Advisory Committee on Administrative \r\nand Budgetary Questions. I hope very much that we will reach a decision on \r\nthis point during the course of this General Assembly session. I must stress \r\nthat there is a relationship between the financing of peace-keeping and the \r\noverall financial situation of the United Nations. The same need for prompt \r\nand full payment of assessed contributions applies there, too. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n15 \r\n(Sir David Hannav. United Kingdom) \r\nIn conclusion, the European Community and its member States welcome \"An \r\nAgenda for Peace\" as a valuable contribution to the continuing debate on the \r\nrole of the United Nations in international affairs. We believe that the \r\naction points should now be followed up in the appropriate bodies for \r\nexample, the Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations, the Charter \r\nCommittee, the Fifth Committee, the Security Council and the Secretariat - and \r\nof course also by Member States themselves and by regional organizations. It \r\nis important that no time be lost in pursuing these points in an \r\naction-oriented way in these forums, and we see the main objective of this \r\ndebate as being to provide stimulus to that decision- making. We look forward \r\nto continuing the discussion and collaboration with other delegations in \r\npursuit of this objective. \r\nMr. BUTLER (Australia): In his first annual report to the General \r\nAssembly on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General identified \r\nclearly the opportunities and challenges facing the United Nations in the \r\npost-cold-war era. \r\nWe have in this new era new opportunities for enhanced global \r\ncooperation to tackle transnational problems, problems: of the environment; \r\narms control; drugs; AIDS; and of course the continuing tragedy of poverty. \r\nWe also face challenges arising from the unleashing of ethnic rivalries and \r\nthe splintering of nation States. \r\nSimply, the demands on the United Nations have never been greater, nor \r\nthe expectations so high. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n16 \r\n(Mr. Butler. Australia) \r\nIn his report to the Assembly, the Secretary-General has set himself \r\nthe ambitious but essential goal of creating \"a new United Nations for a new \r\ninternational era\" (A/47/1, para. 5) a process which he acknowledges will be \r\n\"neither easy nor risk-free\" (A/47/1, para.6). \r\nThe \"new United Nations\" is being put to the test, dramatically, by the \r\noutbreak of conflict, often within and between newly emerging States. In his \r\nlandmark report \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277), the Secretary-General \r\nfocused on the need to enhance the capacity of the United Nations to fulfil \r\nits fundamental Charter objective of \"maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity\" by summarizing a range of actions to prevent, contain and resolve \r\nsituations of conflict. \r\nThe front line of United Nations involvement in peace and security should \r\nbe the prevention of conflict. We should be working through the United \r\nNations to create conditions which minimize insecurity and threats to peace, \r\nand which enable specific high-risk situations to be addressed before they get \r\nto the point of requiring either peace-keeping or, worse still, coercive \r\npeace-enforcement measures. \r\nA major challenge in the years ahead will be to establish effective \r\nmechanisms and means for converting the potential promise of preventive \r\ndiplomacy from rhetoric into reality. \r\nIn his statement to the General Assembly last week, the Australian \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, outlined a \r\nseries of initiatives designed to address the non-military, as well as \r\nmilitary threats to security. Natural disasters, acute poverty, famine and \r\nenvironmental degradation are all fundamental causes of instability and thus \r\nthe United Nations must assume a major role in addressing such non-military \r\nthreats to international peace and security. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n17 \r\n(Mr. Butler. Australia) \r\nAustralia particularly welcomes the creation of the new Department of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs, which has a crucial role to play in seeking to avert \r\npreventable tragedies. One such area where we would like to see an enhanced \r\nUnited Nations role is in the prevention of famine. To this end, we have \r\nproposed the establishment of a group of senior officials from developed and \r\ndeveloping countries and relevant United Nations agencies, supported by a \r\ncomprehensive database, to conduct high-level reviews of the global famine \r\nsituation and to identify emerging crisis situations. Surely this is a case \r\nwhere prevention is vastly preferable to cure. \r\nWe also endorse the Secretary-General\u0027s observation in his report on the \r\nwork of the Organization that democratic structures, popular participation and \r\nobservance of human rights are all fundamental sources of creativity in the \r\nprocess of development. Economic development and political progress go hand \r\nin hand and can mutually reinforce resolution of many of the underlying \r\ntensions which lead to conflict. \r\nToday\u0027s discussion of \"An Agenda for Peace\" is a beginning, not an end. \r\nWe expect the debate to continue and amplify, involving the whole United \r\nNations membership. The contribution that we will make today will highlight \r\none aspect of an \"agenda for peace\" which we believe to be of particular \r\nimportance to the current international situation, namely strengthening the \r\nrole of the United Nations in preventive diplomacy. We plan to take up other \r\naspects of what is a large, but very necessary, agenda in subsequent \r\ni \r\ndiscussions on \"An Agenda for Peace\" in this and other relevant forums. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n18 \r\n(Mr. Butler. Australia) \r\nTurning to the issue that I would like to highlight today, I will centre \r\nmy remarks on means of strengthening the United Nations preventive diplomacy \r\nand peacemaking arrangements to deal at an early stage with specific high-risk \r\nsituations. Others may have their own ideas, and we believe that it is \r\ncrucial that those ideas be put forward, so that all ideas can be discussed \r\nand suggestions further refined in order that we may establish a truly viable \r\nsystem for preventing disputes at the international and regional levels. \r\nIndeed, we believe that preventive diplomacy is so important that it should \r\nbecome a major foundation-stone on which the United Nations new agenda for \r\npeace is built. \r\nOne of the major stumbling-blocks to preventive diplomacy has been the \r\nproblem of timing. The Charter explicitly states, in Article 36, that the \r\nUnited Nations may become involved \"at any stage of a dispute ... or of a \r\nsituation\" and the 1988 Declaration on the Prevention and Removal of Disputes, \r\nwhich was adopted unanimously by the General Assembly, encourages the United \r\nNations to become involved \"at an early stage\" (resolution 43/51. \r\nannex, para. 1 (12)). \r\nIn practice, however, the threshold for defining a situation as a threat \r\nto international peace and security has tended to be the outbreak of armed \r\nhostilities. Typically, the Security Council has waited for this threshold to \r\nbe crossed before it has acted. In cases where the Secretary-General waits to \r\nbe mandated by the Council before acting, the United Nations often finds \r\nitself intervening at the very point where the disputing parties are least \r\nlikely to accept peaceful methods of dispute resolution in other words, when \r\nit is too late. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n19 \r\n(Mr. Butler. Australia) \r\nEffective preventive diplomacy, however, requires action before a dispute \r\nhas reached that threshold, that is, as early as possible before the issues \r\nhave generalized; before antagonisms have become malignant; before the major \r\nmotivation of the parties has become a desire for retribution, and before \r\nparties have become committed and entrapped by their own aggressive posturing, \r\nrhetoric and actions. \r\nThe overriding reason for parties\u0027 reluctance to bring disputes to the \r\nUnited Nations appears to be concern about losing control over \r\ndecision-making. Discussions about the rights of \"sovereignty\" and concerns \r\nabout \"internationalizing\" a dispute translate to mean that many, and probably \r\nmost. States prefer to maintain control over how their disputes will be \r\nresolved, at least until such time as the situation becomes desperate. \r\nBecause of these sensitivities, third parties have also been reluctant to \r\nbring a situation to the Council at an early stage. Thus, Members seldom use \r\nArticle 35, which allows any Member of the United Nations to bring a dispute \r\nto the attention of the Council, and similarly, past Secretaries-General have \r\nrarely used Article 99. \r\nIn our view, the United Nations needs to develop a mechanism which will \r\nbe acceptable to Members and which will allow those who cannot reach a \r\npeaceful settlement on their own to avail themselves of mediation and good \r\noffices at an early stage in their dispute. \r\nWhat is needed is a mechanism which can offer a dispute resolution \r\nservice to its Members to assist them in complying with Chapter VI of the \r\nCharter. Through such a mechanism, Members could maintain a say over how \r\ntheir dispute is settled, while at the same time receiving assistance in \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n20 \r\n(Mr. Butler. Australia) \r\ncommunicating with one another in minimizing inflammatory rhetoric; in \r\ndefining the issues, concerns and grievances which are causing the dispute, \r\nand in creating innovative and imaginative solutions which can address and \r\nreconcile these conflicting interests. There is an increasing recognition \r\namong Member States that it is the Secretary-General and his staff who can \r\nmost effectively offer this kind of assistance. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n21 \r\n(Mr. Butler. Australia) \r\nSome of these ideas are already being implemented within the \r\nSecretariat. Australia applauds the efforts made by the Secretary-General to \r\nestablish geographically-based Divisions within the Department of Political \r\nAffairs, whose task it will be to monitor various regions. We believe that, \r\nif properly supported and resourced, the six Divisions that have been set up \r\nhold considerable promise for providing continuity in conflict-prevention. To \r\nbe effective, however, this newly developed preventive diplomacy and \r\npeacemaking mechanism will need the support of Member States. \r\nFor preventive diplomacy to succeed, it will require adequate resources \r\nand staff who have a sophisticated level of expertise and skill. Currently \r\nthe six Divisions are headed by Directors who have had considerable experience \r\nin good offices and peacemaking. They will, however, need to be supported by \r\nstaff who are skilled in political analysis and who have an in-depth knowledge \r\nof the cultural, political and historical background of the countries of the \r\nregion. \r\nStaff will also be needed who are knowledgeable in conflict-analysis, \r\nnegotiation and mediation. Recruitment of new staff, training of current \r\nstaff through programmes such as the proposed new fellowship programme on \r\npreventive diplomacy and peacemaking of the United Nations Institute for \r\nTraining and Research and the use of expert consultants could all provide the \r\nnecessary skills for carrying out preventive diplomacy. \r\nIn addition, staff will be needed who can devote their full attention to \r\npreventive diplomacy without being consumed by the demands of ongoing, larger \r\ncrises. They will need to be backed up with an adequate infrastructure. \r\nAccess to wire services, on-line computer facilities, data banks, advanced \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n22 \r\n(Mr. Butler. Australia) \r\ntelecommunications and travel for routine visits to the field and to relevant \r\nmeetings will be required. \r\nResources for these vital tasks could be redeployed from other parts of \r\nthe United Nations where they are no longer needed. Indeed, perhaps the most \r\nimportant way in which Member States could contribute to the development of \r\nthis new mechanism is through their support of such a. reallocation of \r\nresources. The amounts involved would not be large, but the benefits accruing \r\nto all of us could be considerable. Of course, Members could also assist the \r\nSecretary-General in developing an adequate infrastructure by providing \r\nvoluntary contributions earmarked for much needed expenses. \r\nAnother way in which Member States could assist the Secretariat would be \r\nto offer expertise through the secondment of experts to help in tasks such as \r\nthe creation of a rapid response information network; the development of \r\ncreative proposals for particular disputes; and the training of middle-level \r\nstaff in political analysis and dispute-resolution. This kind of contribution \r\nfrom Member States has become commonplace in the area of peace-keeping, and \r\ncould also be very useful in the development of preventive diplomacy. \r\nPreventive-diplomacy units will need to establish a rapid-response \r\ninformation network which can provide continuous and reliable information and \r\nwhich will be responsive to changing situations. Members could assist the \r\nSecretary-General by providing regular information on disputes, tensions and \r\ndevelopments in their region. A wide range of sources would allow \r\npreventive-diplomacy staff to examine the reliability of information and would \r\nprovide them with the full range of perspectives on the issues involved. Of \r\ncourse, an independent capacity, on the part of the Secretariat, to assess \r\nrelevant information will be a crucial element in determining its credibility \r\nand usefulness. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n23 \r\n(Mr. Butler. Australia) \r\nRegular and routine visits to the capitals and \"hot spots\" of the region \r\nwould allow Secretariat staff to identify emerging disputes, to track \r\ndevelopments in existing disputes, to develop a sense of trust and a \r\nreputation for fairness, to urge the parties to come to the negotiating table \r\nand to offer good offices and mediation when it is deemed appropriate. Such \r\nvisits would also allow United Nations staff to coordinate on a regular and \r\nconsistent basis with United Nations agencies in the field, as well as with \r\nregional and subregional organisations. \r\nMembers could assist United Nations staff in developing contacts within \r\ntheir countries and their region and facilitate and encourage regular visits \r\nof preventive diplomacy staff. This would allow quiet diplomacy to develop in \r\na manner which did not call attention to itself, and which did not \r\n\"internationalise\" the dispute. Routine visits would, we believe, be more \r\nacceptable to parties than formally constituted \"fact-finding\" missions, \r\nespecially if carried out as standard United Nations practice throughout all \r\nreqions. Thus we believe that quiet diplomacy and early prevention should be \r\nthe essence of preventive diplomacy. Such a mechanism will, we believe, be \r\nmore acceptable to Members and, therefore, more effective. \r\nFinally, Members may be able to assist the Secretary-General and his \r\nstaff in providing or supporting good offices and mediation. The assistance \r\nof the five Central American Presidents in the resolution of the El Salvador \r\ndispute and the Paris Conference on Cambodia are but two examples of how third \r\nparties can assist the United Nations in dispute-resolution through persuasion \r\nor the development of new ideas or proposals. \r\nAustralia therefore urges Members to do everything they can to support \r\nthe efforts of the Secretary-General to establish an effective mechanism for \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n24-25 \r\n(Mr. Butler. Australia) \r\ncarrying out preventive diplomacy. In terms of United Nations operations, \r\npreventive diplomacy is certainly cost-effective when compared to \r\npeace-keeping operations or peace-enforcement. \r\nBut, even more importantly, it is cost-effective in human terms. When \r\ndisputes are resolved through preventive diplomacy, we can avoid the tragic \r\nand wanton loss of life of countless men, women and children, such as we are \r\nnow witnessing in Somalia and the former Yugoslavia. The needless destruction \r\nof homes, cities and social infrastructure could be averted. Resources that \r\nwould have been spent on weapons and war could be available instead to be \r\napplied to the social and economic problems of these societies. When disputes \r\nare settled through preventive diplomacy, grievances are lessened or \r\nameliorated, and hostilities between peoples do not fester and grow into \r\nreverberating echoes of violence. \r\nOf course, some parties will not want to avail themselves of preventive \r\ndiplomacy, and, even when they do, in some cases it will not work. But even \r\nif preventive diplomacy is effective only now and then, it is worth the \r\neffort. If, by having an effective preventive diplomacy-mechanism in place, \r\nwe could have prevented one situation from deteriorating into a Somalia or a \r\nYugoslavia or an Iran-Iraq war or an Afghanistan or a Cambodia, would it not \r\nhave been worth while? Should we not proceed with all haste to prevent the \r\npossibility of future bloodshed in disputes such as those brewing in \r\nNogorno-Karabakh, Georgia and elsewhere? \r\nA new time\u0027requires new approaches, bold steps. Preventive diplomacy is \r\none such step. It would provide a clear response to the particular challenges \r\nwe face in this new international era. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n26 \r\nMr. VAZQUEZ (Argentina) (interpretation from Spanish): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the countries members of the Permanent Mechanism \r\nfor Consultation and Political Concertation, known as the Rio Group that is, \r\nBolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Honduras, on behalf of four \r\nCentral American countries; Jamaica, on behalf of 11 countries members of the \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM); and Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, Venezuela and \r\nArgentina. \r\nOur countries have felt impelled to take part in the debate on agenda \r\nitem 10, the report of the Secretary-General entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\". \r\nThat report, which was requested by the Security Council Summit Meeting held \r\non 31 January 1992, is a valuable instrument that enables us to initiate an \r\nimmediate debate on the strengthening and the future of the Organization. We \r\nalso consider it necessary for the debate to take place in the General \r\nAssembly, the only principal organ of the United Nations with universal \r\nmembership. \r\nIt is appropriate to recall that the Rio Group took the initiative of \r\nissuing statements, circulated as documents A/47/232 and S/24025, prior to the \r\nsubmission of the Secretary-General\u0027s report. We have noted with satisfaction \r\nthe existence of a broad area of agreement between our proposals and the \r\ncontents of \"An Agenda for Peace\". \r\nThe international community has entered a new stage, one in which the \r\nUnited Nations is undoubtedly reserved an important role. In order to live up \r\nto the challenges of the new era, we must deal with issues relating to \r\ncollective security within the framework of a renewed commitment to the letter \r\nand the spirit of the United Nations Charter. In so doing, we shall be able \r\nto begin without delay the task of strengthening the United Nations in the \r\nspheres of preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n27 \r\n(Mr. Vazquez. Argentina) \r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s report introduces a number of interesting \r\nconcepts and proposals. Some of them are aimed at the full enforcement of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, others at improving the work of the Organization. \r\nThere are also innovative proposals. All of them open the way for reflection \r\nand decision-making. Today, we should like to expound on our Group\u0027s initial \r\nposition. \r\nThe framework for a discussion of this document must, we repeat, be the \r\nletter and spirit of the Organization\u0027s Charter. In particular, that \r\ndiscussion must be based on respect for the principles of sovereignty, \r\nnon-intervention, sovereign equality, the territorial integrity of States, the \r\nself-determination of peoples, and the powers and areas of competence of the \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations. \r\nFirst, we should like to discuss the concept of preventive diplomacy. \r\nThe analysis of this issue is important for all United Nations bodies and \r\nregional organizations and, because of its undeniable impact on the \r\nrevitalization of the United Nations system, it should be the subject of \r\ndirect consultations between the Secretary-General and Member States. \r\nAt its last session the General Assembly made an important contribution \r\nwith the adoption by consensus of resolution 46/59, which includes the \r\nDeclaration on Fact-finding by the United Nations in the Field of the \r\nMaintenance of International Peace and Security. Since its inception, the Rio \r\nGroup has considered social and economic instability an important factor in \r\nthe generation df conflicts. Measures aimed at promoting economic and social \r\ndevelopment must be included in the concept of preventive diplomacy. \r\nSecondly, another important aspect of the Secretary-General\u0027s report is \r\nthe question of peacemaking. The General Assembly, the Security Council and \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n28 \r\n(Mr. Vazquez. Argentina) \r\nthe Secretary-General are empowered to take measures, excluding the use of \r\nforce, to limit the magnitude of a conflict and lead the search for a \r\nsolution. Regional organizations can also play an important role in this \r\nconnection. \r\nAll efforts to promote a diplomatic settlement of disputes should be made \r\nin a timely manner. The mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nprovided in Chapter VI of the Charter must be exhausted before recourse is had \r\nto other measures. \r\nWe support a discussion of whether the General Assembly should authorize \r\nthe Secretary-General to request an advisory opinion of the International \r\nCourt of Justice in the case of disputes in which the Secretary-General has \r\nbeen requested to act or has been assigned a. role and the States parties to \r\nthe dispute give their consent for such a request to be made. \r\nThirdly, with regard to peace-keeping operations, it is important to \r\nrecognize that such operations constitute a relevant tool for the \r\ninternational community to use in leading conflicts towards negotiations, and \r\nsometimes for containing armed confrontation. \r\nSuch peace-keeping operations are perceived by international public \r\nopinion as one of the most effective and prestigious activities of the United \r\nNations, and they generate high expectations. Such prestige is certainly well \r\ndeserved and entails a high degree of sacrifice from the men and women who \r\ntake part in these operations. \r\nOver the past 40 years the United Nations Secretariat has acquired a high \r\nlevel of experience in handling peace-keeping operations. The Secretariat and \r\nMember States, through the Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations, may \r\nimprove those operations and make the necessary adjustments to the rather new \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n29-30 \r\n(Mr. Vazquez. Argentina) \r\ncharacteristics and patterns that emerge. In that connection we should like \r\nto emphasize General Assembly resolution 46/48. \r\nToday, one of the most serious constraints such activities face is \r\nfinancial in nature. Yet the cost of peace-keeping operations is infinitely \r\nlower than the cost of war. It is important to ensure the Organization\u0027s \r\nfinancial ability to carry out this task. \r\nFor the Rio Group, the financing of peace-keeping operations is a \r\ncollective but differentiated activity. In this, the permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council have a special responsibility. The present system of \r\nfinancing must be given predictability and stability by the \r\ninstitutionalization of the system of assessed contributions established in \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 3101 (XXVIII). \r\nFourthly, the consolidation of peace once conflicts have ended is a \r\nconcept related to that of preventive diplomacy. The Rio Group considers that \r\nthis process should focus, through concrete measures, on the economic and \r\nsocial spheres as well as on all those areas directly related to the various \r\naspects of security. \r\nFifthly, we have already made reference to regional organizations. A \r\ncloser relationship between the United Nations and those organizations must be \r\nsought within the framework of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter and \r\nthe charters of those organizations. The Rio Group considers that the current \r\nand potential role to be played by the regional organizations in preventive \r\ndiplomacy and peacemaking and peace-keeping is very important. In that \r\nconnection the Organization of American States has already stated its \r\nwillingness to cooperate with the United Nations and coordinate its efforts to \r\nimprove collective means of preventing and solving conflicts. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n31 \r\n(Mr. Vazquez. Argentina) \r\nIn its document the Rio Group has also brought up some points relating to \r\nthe Security Council, the body with the primary responsibility for maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security. Given the increasing role of the Security \r\nCouncil, it is becoming ever more necessary that its work reflect a clear \r\nawareness that in carrying out its tasks the Council acts on behalf of the \r\nMembers of the Organization. The Security Council\u0027s deliberative and \r\ndecision-making processes must be transparent. While the value and usefulness \r\nof informal consultations should not be overlooked, Article 31 of the Charter, \r\nregarding the participation of States that are not members of the Security \r\nCouncil in those questions that affect their interests, should be borne in \r\nmind. \r\nToday more than ever before it is important to highlight the role that \r\ncould be played by the reports of the Security Council to the General \r\nAssembly. Such reports, in so far as they are substantive, could be the \r\nchannel of communication between the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly, as provided for in Article 15, paragraph 1 and Article 24, \r\nparagraph 3 of the Charter. As regards decisions of the Security Council that \r\naffect third parties, practical mechanisms need to be set up for the effective \r\nimplementation of Article 50 of the Charter. \r\nThe Rio Group has identified other suggestions included in the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report that in its view will undoubtedly also call for a \r\nslow and careful analysis by all Member States. We shall not try to cover \r\nthem all and we shall mention just a few: an invitation from the Security \r\nCouncil to a revitalized and restructured Economic and Social Council to \r\nreport on events that might threaten international peace and security; \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n32 \r\n(Mr. Vazquez. Argentina) \r\npreventive deployment of a United Nations presence along the border of a party \r\nto a conflict at the request of that party and a request for unilateral \r\npreventive deployment if there is fear of a transboundary attack; the \r\nestablishment of demilitarized zones as a form of preventive deployment; \r\npreventive deployment in the event of an internal crisis in a country, at its \r\nrequest; the use of military force in accordance with the mechanisms provided \r\nfor in Chapter VII of the Charter; early adherence to the special agreements \r\nprovided for in Article 43 of the Charter, in order to put troops at the \r\ndisposal of the Security Council on a permanent basis; the establishment of \r\npeace-enforcement units; the adoption of measures, including those provided \r\nfor in Chapter VII of the Charter, in the event of threats to the security of \r\nUnited Nations staff members; and various proposals for the financing of \r\npeace-keeping operations. \r\nThe Rio Group considers that the foregoing issues are of great importance \r\nand require urgent examination by the international community. In this \r\ncontext, we should now turn to the question of the procedures that should be \r\nadopted for a practical future discussion of the report of the \r\nSecretary-General entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\" and the decisions required to \r\nimplement it. \r\nThe Security Council has set up a working group made up of its members to \r\nidentify the areas that should be considered and acted upon by the Council. \r\nSome subsidiary organs of the General Assembly have already begun examining \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General. \r\nIn the light of the foregoing, the Rio Group considers it advisable for \r\nthe General Assembly to establish an open-ended working group that would \r\nexamine the \"Agenda for Peace\" and submit to the Assembly recommendations or \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n33 \r\n(Mr. Vazquez. Argentina) \r\ndecisions on those proposals that are of concern to the General Assembly. \r\nThat working group would undoubtedly contribute to the establishment of a \r\ndialogue with other organs to which the report is addressed and would provide \r\npolitical orientation for the specialized subsidiary organs. The member \r\ncountries of the Rio Group are convinced that because of its importance and \r\nscope the \"Agenda for Peace\" deserves our deep appreciation and that we must \r\ncarefully analyse it. That is the reason for our interest in creating the \r\nproposed working group. \r\nWe cannot finish this statement without recalling, as we did in the Rio \r\nGroup document, that \r\n\"international peace and security will be genuinely guaranteed to the \r\nextent that the underlying causes of conflicts are eliminated. In \r\nreaffirming the importance of economic and social development as one of \r\nthe basic premises underlying the strengthening of international peace \r\nand security, we believe that, along with violations of the Charter and \r\nother norms of international law, the disparity in wealth between \r\nnations, which leads to crises caused by a whole series of unmet needs, \r\nmay be an important source of instablility in the post-cold-war world.\" \r\n(A/47/232, annex, para. 5) \r\nThe Rio Group considers that, although it is true that the \"Agenda for \r\nPeace\" constitutes a document of far-reaching importance for the Organization \r\nas far as its management and its objectives are concerned, it must be \r\nremembered that peace is only one of the issues that deserve our greatest \r\nattention. A more intense focus on development could consitute the \"kind \r\nface\" of the Organization, and for that reason it seems to us that the \"Agenda \r\nfor Peace\" proposed by the Secretary-General must be accompanied by a true \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Turk. Slovenia) \r\nIn the past this provision was invoked in a number of situations, albeit \r\nless frequently than required. Let us only mention that in the early 1950s a \r\nparticular aspect of the situation in the Balkans, arising from military and \r\npolitical pressure of a super-Power on a smaller State, was considered by the \r\nGeneral Assembly on that basis. Action by the Assembly contributed very \r\nconsiderably to the containment of that situation and prevented its potential \r\ndeterioration into an armed conflict. \r\nAt this very session the General Assembly was informed by the Foreign \r\nMinisters of Italy and Austria, two of Slovenia\u0027s neighbours, that the \r\nsituation concerning the German-speaking inhabitants of Alto Adige or South \r\nTyrol, in Italy had been successfully resolved. It is worth recalling that \r\nthe General Assembly took up that situation, in 1960, on the basis of \r\nArticle 14 of the United Nations Charter. The preventive effect of that \r\naction was important, and may serve today as a source of inspiration for \r\ndealing with certain new situations. \r\nThe provisions of Article 14 of the United Nations Charter are invaluable \r\nfor the General Assembly, which may at the initiative of a Member State or \r\nof the Secretary-General - address any political situation, \"regardless of \r\norigin\", much before it deteriorates into an open dispute or even into a \r\nsituation involving a threat to international peace and security. \r\nArticle 14 of the United Nations Charter clearly permits various types of \r\naction by the General Assembly. According to an advisory opinion of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, delivered in 1962 to be found in \r\nInternational Court of Justice Reports, 1962, page 163 the General Assembly \r\nmay not only make substantive or procedural recommendations regarding \"the \r\npeaceful adjustment\" of the situation, but, so the Court said, may take any \r\nmeasure short of coercive action. In our opinion, therefore, the General \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n38 \r\n(Mr. Turk. Slovenia) \r\nAssembly may create working bodies and develop various methods to supervise \r\nthe implementation of its decisions concerning situations considered on the \r\nbasis of Article 14 of the Charter. It goes without saying that in pursuit of \r\nsuch an approach a certain amount of imagination and a great deal of hard \r\ndiplomatic work would be required. \r\nThe report of the Secretary-General entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\" \r\ncontains a series of ideas concerning cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand regional arrangements and organizations. Indeed, it would be a serious \r\nomission if that aspect of international efforts for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security were overlooked. The Secretary-General \r\ncorrectly states, in paragraph 61 of the report that \r\n\"The Charter deliberately provides no precise definition of regional \r\narrangements and agencies, thus allowing useful flexibility.\" \r\nIt is important to understand the changing nature of such arrangements in \r\nchanged circumstances, that is, the fact that some regional arrangements may \r\nbecome obsolete, while others gain new roles and potential which go \r\nsubstantially beyond the original design. \r\nRecent changes, in particular those that took place in Europe, have \r\nillustrated the dynamic nature of regional arrangements with abundant \r\nclarity. Whereas some organizations, including the Warsaw Treaty \r\nOrganization, ceased to exist, others, including in particular the Conference \r\non Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), gained completely new roles \r\nwhich are much more ambitious than originally designed. \r\nIn some instances new circumstances give rise to the creation of entirely \r\nnew groupings, such as the Central European Group formerly known as the \r\n\"pentagonal\" and for a period of time as the \"hexagonal\" group. \r\nThe new and dynamic roles of regional arrangements can be seen in all \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n39 \r\n(Mr, Tiirk. Slovenia) \r\nregions of the world, and they include a variety of groups, such as the \r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Rio Group and others. \r\nHow best can the United Nations take advantage of this dynamic element in \r\ninternational relations and, more specifically, how useful can such groups \r\nbecome in the future activities of the General Assembly? \r\nAn interpretation which would limit this potential only to the framework \r\ndefined in Article 53 of the Charter that is, the utilization of regional \r\narrangements by the Security Council for enforcement action would certainly \r\nfall short of actual needs. In order fully to utilize their potential and to \r\nrealize maximum effect, it is necessary to develop a continuous and productive \r\ndialogue, perhaps within the General Assembly, focused on those issues which \r\ncan best be understood in the context of regional arrangements. Full \r\nadvantage must be taken of the fact that regional arrangements - as a rule \r\nprovide an important opportunity for understanding local circumstances, the \r\nroots and the history of a given problem, and possible solutions. It is not \r\nnecessary that such a dialogue with regional arrangements be made contingent \r\nupon any formal stipulation. The important requirement here is that it be \r\nconducted in accordance with the principles of the Charter and that it yield \r\nproper and practical results. The relations between the United Nations and \r\nregional institutions should be seen in terms not of subordination but of \r\ncooperation and dialogue. \r\nI should now like to proceed to a specific thematic issue which has \r\nrecently given rise to serious consideration, namely to the issue of national \r\nand ethnic minorities. The General Assembly will soon have before it a \r\ndeclaration on the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, \r\nreligious and linguistic minorities. The Secretary-General has reminded us in \r\nhis \"Agenda for Peace\" that \"The League of Nations provided a machinery for the \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n40 \r\n(Mr. Turk. Slovenia) \r\ninternational protection of minorities\". The adoption of that declaration, \r\n\"together with the increasingly effective machinery of the United Nations \r\ndealing with human rights, should enhance the situation of minorities as well \r\nas the stability of States\". (A/47/277, para. 18) \r\nHere, as we see, the Secretary-General has placed a great deal of hope in \r\nUnited Nations machinery dealing with human rights. However, a note of \r\ncaution seems appropriate. Like all other international machinery in the \r\nfield of human rights, the human rights mechanisms of the United Nations lack \r\nspecific experience in dealing with questions involving different minorities. \r\nFurthermore, such situations usually involve a political dimension which goes \r\nbeyond human rights considerations, and this should be duly heeded. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n41 \r\n(Mr. Turk. Slovenia) \r\nCoordinated action by the human rights bodies of the United Nations and \r\nthe appropriate political organs, including, when circumstances so warrant, \r\nthe General Assembly, would be appropriate. I referred earlier, in the \r\ncontext of my references to Article 14 of the Charter, to « specific situation \r\ninvolving a minority the German-speaking inhabitants of \r\nAlto Adige/South Tyrol in Italy a situation which was successfully dealt \r\nwith and resolved by due reference to the General Assembly resolutions adopted \r\non the basis of Article 14 of the Charter. It is worth keeping in mind that \r\nthat case was not brought before the General Assembly as o case involving only \r\nissues of human rights. It was raised and resolved primarily as a political \r\nissue. The lesson for the future is this: there are situations where it is \r\nnecessary to address the political dimension of problems involving \r\nminorities. Let me add in passing that such situations often arise in areas \r\nwhere there is no clear ethnic majority or in those States where there is no \r\nsingle ethnic majority. Political solutions must be sought in such \r\nsituations, and political organs of the United Nations, including the General \r\nAssembly, should be active. In fact, the General Assembly could develop a \r\nvery useful role in such matters and could, if need be, act through \r\nappropriate ad hoc bodies constituted for this purpose. \r\nWe are fully aware of the fact that the ideas expressed in this statement \r\nrequire critical consideration and further refinement. We are also looking \r\nforward to the comments other participants in this discussion will have to \r\nmake. Like other delegations, we too are aware of the complexity of issues \r\naddressed in the Secretary-General\u0027s reports currently under consideration. \r\nHowever, all this should not deter us from the attempt to find new answers to \r\nold and new questions. The expectations of world opinion are high and our \r\nresponsibility is considerable. It would be too ambitious to expect that the \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Turk. Slovenia) \r\ndebate of these few days in plenary meetings alone will yield optimal \r\nresults. Therefore we believe that it would be appropriate to conduct, \r\nthroughout this session of the General Assembly, a series of informal \r\nconsultations on all pertinent questions dealt with in the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\nreports currently being discussed in plenary meetings, with a view to \r\npreparing appropriate decisions to be adopted at the end of the session. \r\nPerhaps we should invite you, Mr. President, together with the General \r\nCommittee, to develop the most appropriate working method of informal \r\nconsultations which would help the Assembly to formulate the right decisions \r\nand to respond to the challenges of our time, including in particular those \r\nreflected in the Secretary-General\u0027s reports. It goes without saying that the \r\nrepresentatives of Slovenia will assist in such an endeavour to the best of \r\ntheir abilities. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I should like to inform representatives that, with a \r\nview to assisting delegations in their deliberations under agenda item 10, the \r\nSecretariat has prepared a paper compiling all of the specific recommendations \r\ncontained in the report of the Secretary-General entitled \"An Agenda for \r\nPeace\". The document was issued yesterday under the symbol A/INF/47/5 and is \r\navailable at the documents distribution counter. \r\nMr. HAJNOCZI (Austria): Austria welcomes this opportunity to \r\ncomment on this year\u0027s report of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/47/1), which builds on his earlier, seminal report \"An Agenda \r\nfor Peace\" (A/47/277). Both are timely and inspiring documents. Timely, \r\nbecause never before have countries and peoples of the world relied more on \r\nthe United Nations; timely, because as Austrian Federal Chancellor Vranitzky \r\nput it during the Summit Meeting of the Security Council on 31 January: \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n43 \r\n(Mr, Hajnoczi. Austria) \r\n\"... the end of the cold war has freed minds and resources which were for \r\nso long bound by a wasteful and useless confrontation\". (S/PVt3046, Pt61) \r\nInspiring, because the world is now \u003c\u003e better but less stable place, which \r\ncreates almost daily new tasks and new challenges for the Organization. \r\nIn the Security Council Austria has advocated substantive and urgent \r\nconsideration of the recommendations in the Secretary-General\u0027s report \"An \r\nAgenda for Peace\" concerning the Council since the report was issued in June. \r\nWe hope that such a consideration will now take place there, with Council \r\nmembers having the benefit of the views heard during the general debate and \r\nagain today. Foreign Minister Mock has already expressed Austria\u0027s support \r\nfor further efforts to improve the capacity of the United Nations in \r\nconflict-prevention, peace-keeping, peacemaking and peace-building. \r\nToday, I shall therefore limit myself to commenting on aspects which \r\nconcern primarily the General Assembly. While I shall attempt to be as \r\nsuccinct as possible, one more general remark is in order: instability and \r\ninsecurity have many sources military, political, economic, ethnic, \r\nreligious, social, humanitarian and ecological. We must therefore take an \r\nintegrated, comprehensive approach even though it will be implemented only \r\nstep by step. \r\nThe Secretary-General shares this view and has expressed it much more \r\neloquently. Austria supports the following recommendations concerning the \r\nGeneral Assembly in the order in which they appear in his report \"An Agenda \r\nfor Peace\": increased resort to fact-finding missions, especially for \r\npreventive purposes, with the understanding that there will be a follow-up; \r\nimpartially provided humanitarian assistance, including civilian assistance in \r\nmaintaining security; utilizing the General Assembly\u0027s role as a universal \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n44-45 \r\n(Mr. Hainoczi. Austria) \r\nforum to consider and recommend action to pre-empt or contain situations \r\nlikely to threaten international peace and security; authorizing the \r\nSecretary-General to take advantage of the advisory competence of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice; mobilizing the resources of the whole United \r\nNations system for the amelioration of disputes through assistance; \r\nconsideration of the idea of financing peace-keeping operations from defence \r\nbudgets; improving training for civilian, police and military peace-keeping \r\npersonnel; promoting good governance at all levels. Here we would stress in \r\nparticular the strengthening of democratic processes and institutions, which \r\nthe United Nations can foster by providing advice, assistance and monitors; \r\nconsultations between the United Nations and regional arrangements in the \r\ncase of Europe, Austria has proposed the creation of a liaison mechanism \r\nbetween the United Nations and the relevant European arrangements, in \r\nparticular the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), whose \r\nConflict Prevention Centre and Security Forum are both located in Vienna \r\nrecommending measures to improve the safety of United Nations personnel; \r\ncharging interest on the amounts of assessed contributions that are not paid \r\nin time; increasing the Working Capital Fund and the establishment of a \r\nrevolving peace-keeping reserve fund. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n46 \r\n(Mr. Hainoczi. Austria) \r\nAustria also welcomes the strong emphasis given in the report on the work \r\nof the Organization to the role of the United Nations in international \r\neconomic relations. The overwhelming problems of poverty, underdevelopment, \r\npopulation pressures, mass migration, depletion of the ozone layer, global \r\nwarming and environmental degradation cannot be dealt with successfully by any \r\none country or any group of countries no matter how powerful they might be. \r\nThese global issues force all nations to acknowledge their interdependence. \r\nIt is to be hoped that this will lead to greater solidarity and equity in the \r\ndealings of nations with one another. The United Nations, and probably only \r\nthe United Nations, can provide a framework in which this new global \r\npartnership for sustainable development can be translated into concrete policy \r\nformulation and implementation. Austria pledges its full support for the \r\nSecretary-General in pursuing the goals that he formulates in his report for \r\nthe United Nations in the economic, social and related fields. In this \r\ncontext we feel that it would be desirable to find appropriate ways to \r\nconsolidate the formidable analytical capacity of the United Nations system so \r\nthat economic policy guidance can be given by the United Nations that would \r\nindeed influence political decisions of economic actors by virtue of the very \r\nquality of the assessments on which the recommendations are based. We have \r\nformulated detailed proposals concerning a system of consolidated reports in \r\nthe context of the Economic and Social Council\u0027s ad hoc Committee on Enhancing \r\nInternational Cooperation for Development: The Role of the United Nations \r\nSystem. \r\nIn his report on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General has \r\nalso rightly emphasized the importance of the promotion of human rights as one \r\nof the priority objectives of the Charter, along with preserving international \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Hainoczi. Austria) \r\npeace and security and promoting development. He has also stressed their \r\ninterrelatedness. Austria supports his proposal that he and expert human \r\nrights bodies be empowered to bring massive violations of human rights to the \r\nattention of the Security Council, together with recommendations for action. \r\nWe also wholeheartedly endorse his view that the United Nations must be able \r\nto take preventive measures and that the World Conference on Human Rights, to \r\nbe held in Vienna in 1993, will be important in this regard. A report from a \r\ngroup of experts commissioned by the Secretary-General on possible preventive \r\nstrategies in the social, humanitarian and human rights fields could be a \r\nuseful basis for our further deliberations. \r\nTo sum up: Austria is profoundly convinced of the inextricable \r\ninterrelationship between the political, the socio-economic and the \r\nhumanitarian missions of the United Nations. It is our hope that in the \r\ncourse of this session of the General Assembly, and inspired by the proposals \r\nof the Secretary-General, we will be able to advance on all tracks in our \r\npursuit of a more just world order where men, women and children in every part \r\nof the globe can live in peace and freedom and enjoy a fair share of the \r\nEarth\u0027s resources without jeopardizing their children\u0027s ability to do the same \r\nin the future. \r\nMr. MONTANO (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish): The Mexican \r\ndelegation fully supports the statement made by the Permanent Representative \r\nof Argentina, on behalf of the Rio Group, in relation to the present agenda \r\nitem. We should nevertheless like to note a number of points which are of \r\nparticular interest to the Government of Mexico. \r\nThe invitation to the Secretary-General by the summit meeting of the \r\nSecurity Council to submit to the membership of the United Nations an analysis \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n48 \r\n(Mr. Montano. Mexico) \r\nand recommendations on ways of strengthening and making more efficient the \r\ncapacity of the United Nations for preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and \r\npeace-keeping, was undoubtedly a response to the universal concern to find \r\nadequate formulas for meeting the challenges the community of nations faces as \r\na result of the end of the cold war. \r\nThe content of \"An Agenda for Peace\" calls for joint reflection and \r\ninvites us to seek, in constant dialogue with the Secretary-General, the means \r\nand mechanisms for giving the United Nations the necessary capacity to \r\ndischarge its delicate mandate in the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. The holding of this debate, which we have always urged and \r\nencouraged, is convincing proof of our interest in the report, the importance \r\nwe attach to it, and the need for careful consideration of its recommendations. \r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" is rich in ideas, imaginative in conception and \r\nambitious in the proposals it makes, on a par with the great challenges facing \r\nthe Organization. It makes contributions which already undoubtedly lay the \r\nfoundations for the new and more enduring structures the United Nations needs \r\nin this new phase of international life, which are referred to clearly in the \r\n\"Report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization\", which was \r\nsubmitted recently for consideration by the General Assembly. \r\nProgress in building these structures calls for a concerted effort by all \r\nMembers of the Organization, and accordingly the Secretary-General\u0027s statement \r\nin \"An Agenda for Peace\" that the foundation stone of the work of the United \r\nNations \"is and must remain the State\" (para. 17) seems to us fundamental. \r\nRespect for the fundamental sovereignty of States is critical in any \r\ninternational process. This is a matter of practical realism, not simply a \r\nposition of principle. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n49-50 \r\n(Mr. Montano. Mexico) \r\nThe ideas contained in the report aimed at achieving a better balance \r\nbetween the principal organs of the United Nations appear to us timely and \r\nappropriate. The strengthening of the Organization must be carried out within \r\nthe framework of the functions and responsibilities assigned to each of the \r\nprincipal organs. The primacy which the Charter assigns to the General \r\nAssembly, as the Organization\u0027s universal and pluralist governing body \r\npar excellence needs to be recalled and reaffirmed. One of the tasks the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report puts before us is that of achieving greater \r\ncoordination between the Assembly and the Security Council in questions \r\nrelating to international peace and security. \r\nStrengthening the Secretary-General\u0027s capacity for action is an important \r\nstep towards creating an Organization capable of responding in a timely and \r\neffective manner to the growing demands placed upon it by Member States. \r\nHence, the continued importance of smooth coordination between the functions \r\nof the Secretariat and those of the principal organs. \r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s report is valuable not only for the proposals it \r\ncontains but also for the ideas it suggests. We believe that the chapter on \r\npreventive diplomacy could well be supplemented by the one that deals with \r\npost-conflict peace-building. In particular, we consider that support should \r\nbe given to the idea that the efforts to identify and support structures which \r\nwill tend to consolidate peace and advance a sense of confidence and \r\nwell-being among people should also be regarded as preventive mechanisms. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. Montano. Mexico) \r\nMexico\u0027s experience as a member of the Group of Friends of the \r\nSecretary-General in the dispute with El Salvador confirms this view. \r\nLikewise, we consider that an affirmative response should be given to the \r\nrecommendation that the Secretary-General be authorized to seek advisory \r\nopinions from the International Court of Justice, of course with the consent \r\nof the States involved. We believe that this will also strengthen the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s capacity for preventive diplomacy. \r\nAs we have noted, the concepts and ideas in the report merit careful \r\nstudy. In particular, we feel that greater clarity is needed with regard to \r\nsome of the more innovative proposals, such as preventive deployment. This is \r\na concept which needs to be more precisely defined in order to make it clear \r\nin what situations and in what way that mechanism would be employed. We \r\nshould point out at this juncture that the adoption of any measure that might \r\nimpair sovereign rights or be transformed into an excuse to intervene in the \r\ninternal affairs of States would cause us concern. \r\nIn the same context, we consider that what is referred to as: \r\n\"support for the transformation of deficient national structures and \r\ncapabilities, and for the strengthening of new democratic institutions\" \r\n(A/47/277, para. 59) \r\n- albeit a worthy proposal - merits cautious consideration, since these ideas \r\nfall exclusively within the sovereignty of States. \r\nMy delegation is aware that the content of the \"Agenda for Peace\" should \r\nnot be viewed as a fixed package, but as a set of proposals applicable to the \r\nshort, the medium and the long term. Like any political endeavour, it calls \r\nfor in-depth and substantive analysis of its costs and benefits. \r\nNevertheless, in defining the priorities a pragmatic approach needs to be \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. Montano. Mexico) \r\ntaken that will make it possible to identify, on the basis of daily practice, \r\nproblems capable of being resolved in the shortest possible time. In this \r\nrespect, there is an urgent need to define and lay the foundations for \r\nrecognition of the fact that there are members of the international community \r\nwhich bear greater responsibility for meeting the financial requirements \r\nneeded to guarantee international peace and security. \r\nMexico wishes forcefully to support the proposal made by the \r\nrepresentative of the United Kingdom on behalf of the Twelve that, as soon as \r\npossible, a monument should be erected as a tribute to those who have fallen \r\nin the course of peace-keeping operations. \r\nA document such as the one we are considering today needs to be viewed \r\nin the broader context of the Organization\u0027s activities as described in the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report (A/47/1), which correctly avers that States see the \r\nUnited Nations as an instrument capable of maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity, of \"advancing justice and human rights, and of promoting, in the \r\nwords of the Charter, social progress and better standards of life in larger \r\nfreedom\". \r\nAs the Secretary-General rightly points out in his report, the historic \r\ntime we are living through constitutes \"an opportunity regained\" (A/47/1. \r\nIntroduction). We have entered upon a new phase of international life which \r\nmakes it incumbent upon us to fulfil the promises and expectations that in \r\nrecent decades were disappointed. It is time for the United Nations to have \r\nthe means, including the political will, needed to give shape to the \r\nresponsibility conferred on it by the Charter to promote economic and social \r\ndevelopment. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Montano. Mexico) \r\nWe agree that the United Nations: \r\n\"is the only institution capable of comprehensively addressing global \r\nproblems in their political, humanitarian and socio-economic dimensions.\" \r\n(A/47/1, para. 68) \r\nThe international structure requires better and more effective diplomatic \r\ninstruments for conflict prevention, and for peace-building. But this \r\nstructure is clearly fragile if it does not include mechanisms for ensuring \r\nthe full economic and social development of all peoples. The need to take an \r\napproach that integrates the objectives of peace and security with the overall \r\nobjectives of development, at an equivalent level of priority, is an idea that \r\nmeets with our strongest support. We shall seek to work together with the \r\nSecretary-General to make the development programme he proposes in his report \r\na reality. \r\nJust as the Security Council has begun analysing \"An Agenda for Peace\", \r\nwe consider it appropriate for the General Assembly, as a principal organ of \r\nthe Organization and the only one that is universal in nature, to do the same. \r\nSubsidiary bodies of the Assembly have already taken important steps in \r\nconsidering specific aspects of \"An Agenda for Peace\". Their deliberations \r\nwill be of the greatest importance, and they should continue their valuable \r\nwork. \r\nFor this reason we most strongly support the proposal made by the Rio \r\nGroup to the effect that it would be desirable for the General Assembly to \r\nestablish, under, its guidance, a working group to consider \"An Agenda for \r\nPeace\". Such a group, of open-ended composition, will enable us to deal \r\nsystematically and in detail with the content of the report. It will also \r\nopen up channels for dialogue among all Member States on the important ideas \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n54-55 \r\n(Mr. Montano. Mexico) \r\nand proposals contained in the report, thus facilitating the adoption of \r\ndecisions on those issues which merit the consensus support of this forum. \r\nOur idea is not aimed at usurping mandates or at impeding specialized \r\nconsideration. On the contrary, we are seeking to bring into being a \r\nframework for analysis which will of itself constitute an active example of \r\nthe principles of democracy and transparency in the work of the Organization. \r\nThe suggested working group and the concomitant efforts being made will be the \r\nmelting pot of ideas that is so much needed if we are not to lose the \r\n\"opportunity regained\". \r\nMr. SARDENBERG (Brazil): The representative of Argentina has \r\nalready expressed on behalf of the Rio Group, to which Brazil has the honour \r\nof belonging, the basic considerations of our delegations on the document \"An \r\nAgenda for Peace\" (A/47/277). \r\nWhile fully endorsing those views, which reflect to a large extent the \r\ncontent of document A/47/232 circulated by the Rio Group last May, I would \r\nlike to comment further on some of the elements contained in the report \r\npresented by the Secretary-General. \r\nI wish to thank the Secretary-General for having prepared such a \r\nfar-reaching document containing many new and relevant ideas and proposals. \r\nAs stressed by the spokesman for the Rio Group, some of them aim at promoting \r\nthe observance and implementation of the provisions of the Charter; others \r\nseek to improve the practices of the Organization. The ensemble of these \r\nideas calls for thorough consideration by the entire membership of the United \r\nNations. \r\nA fast-evolving international environment entails a search for conceptual \r\nframeworks capable of dealing with change. A wide-ranging dialogue is called \r\nfor in the interest of all States. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n56 \r\n(Mr. Sardenberg. Brazil) \r\nIn the post-cold-war era, when the arms race, which has consumed hundreds \r\nof billions of dollars annually, is beginning to abate, the opportunity should \r\nnot be lost to address all dimensions of concern, including social and \r\neconomic inequalities at the international level. As the representative of \r\nBrazil said in the opening speech of the general debate, \r\n\"An agenda for peace cannot overlook the agenda for development\". \r\n(A/47/PV.4. p. 22-25) \r\nWhile strengthening the relevant activities of preventive diplomacy, \r\npeacemaking, peace-keeping and post-conflict peace-building, we must also \r\nstrengthen the capability of the United Nations for the equally urgent task of \r\npreventive peace-building. \r\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that to maintain peace it is not enough \r\nto achieve a state of the absence of war. Peace should be understood as a \r\ndynamic process encompassing the concomitant promotion of fair international \r\neconomic relations, strict respect for the rule of law, within and across \r\nborders, and the democratization of international relations. \r\nAs the representative of Argentina indicated, the Rio Group has \r\nidentified a number of important questions contained in \"An Agenda for Peace\" \r\nthat require careful consideration by the Members of the Organization. Many of \r\nthe ideas presented in the Secretary-General\u0027s report ideas such as \r\npreventive deployment, peace-enforcement units, early warning and sanctions \r\nunder Chapter VII - are more of a military and intelligence-related nature. \r\nIn the view of my delegation, a peace agenda should also underscore the \r\nimportance of instances of a political and diplomatic nature. \r\nIn the broadest sense, it could be said that all activities of the United \r\nNations are devoted to preventive diplomacy. To be effective and successful, \r\ndiplomatic activities require a considerable degree of flexibility and \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Sardenberg. Brazil) \r\ncreativity. All peaceful means provided for in the Charter must be exhausted \r\nbefore military or other enforcement action is resorted to. There should be \r\nno automatic resort to action entailing the use of military means. \r\nBefore expanding on, or extrapolating from, selected provisions of the \r\nCharter, we must endeavour to make full use of the resources already provided \r\nfor in the Charter. One may, for instance, contemplate a more active role for \r\nthe General Assembly pursuant to Article 14, under which the Assembly may \r\nrecommend measures for the peaceful adjustment of any situation deemed likely \r\nto affect international peace and security. It is incumbent upon us to give \r\nmore active expression to those provisions. \r\nIn this context, there is an important role for fact-finding activities, \r\nas regulated by the Declaration on Fact-finding by the United Nations in the \r\nField of the Maintenance of International Peace and Security, adopted last \r\nyear in resolution 46/59. \r\nAnother mechanism that could be more fully exploited this time to \r\nfacilitate the work of the Security Council is the provision in Article 29 \r\nfor the establishment of ad hoc subsidiary organs, composed not only of \r\nCouncil members, but also of relevant parties involved in a situation \r\naffecting international peace and security. In this regard, more than 20 \r\nyears ago a memorandum by Brazil appeared in document A/7922, in which we \r\nsuggested that the Security Council consider the desirability of establishing \r\nad hoc committees for the peaceful settlement of disputes; we proposed that, \r\nwhen appropriate, and with due regard to the relevant provisions of the \r\nCharter, the Council could refer to such committees any dispute as described \r\nin Article 33 of the Charter, or a similar situation in order to promote or \r\nfacilitate a solution in accordance with the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr, Sardenberg. Brazil) \r\nThese ideas are but a few examples of diplomatic tools for preventive \r\ndiplomacy and peacemaking that are already contemplated in the Charter and \r\ncould be better utilized by the Organization. \r\nThe strengthening of the United Nations in the field of international \r\npeace and security requires the strengthening of all its relevant organs. The \r\nCharter provides the conditions for the effective and harmonious functioning \r\nof these different bodies, without conflict of competence. Their actions can \r\nand should be mutually reinforcing. \r\nTo prevent what the Secretary-General, in his report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/47/1) warns is a possible \"crisis of expectations\", we must \r\nprovide adequate resources and conditions of work for all relevant organs, \r\nwhich in recent times have gone through a somewhat unbalanced process of \r\nrevitalization. In fact, document A/47/1 reports, on page 6 \"Expanding \r\nactivities of the Security Council\", an \"Expanding role of peace-keeping\" and \r\n\"Expanding mandates of the Secretariat\", but no corresponding expansion for \r\nthe General Assembly can be reported at this stage. \r\nThe report on the work of the Organization presents data and tables that \r\nunderscore the dramatic increase in the work-load of the Security Council and \r\nthe related increases in peace-keeping operations and Secretariat activities. \r\nBut, as my delegation sees it, we ought to avoid the assumption that any and \r\nall matters affecting international peace and security should necessarily be \r\ndealt with at the level of the Security Council. There are instances in which \r\nthe General Assembly may have an important role to play. In others it might \r\nbe more appropriate to entrust the leading role to regional organizations. \r\nPractice should allow for a harmonious and coordinated complementarity of \r\nroles between the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Secretary-General \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n59 \r\n(Mr. Sardenberg. Brazil) \r\nand, as the case may be, regional organizations or the International Court of \r\nJustice. \r\nAn effective peace agenda should seek to promote revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly\u0027s role in the maintenance of international peace and security \r\nby making full use of the possibilities foreseen in Articles 10, 11, 13, 14, \r\n15 and 17 of the Charter. In situations of international tension or crisis, \r\nan appropriate presence and action of the General Assembly should be felt \r\nimmediately and constantly. \r\nMore room should be provided for the political and diplomatic efforts of \r\nthe parties to the conflict themselves and of regional organizations. We \r\nbelieve that there should be clear recognition of the fact that the actions or \r\narrangements of the United Nations and of regional organizations can and \r\nshould be mutually reinforcing and complementary. But it should also be \r\nrecognized that the United Nations and the regional organizations have their \r\nown Charters and their specific mandates and competence. Cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the regional bodies should be carried out on the basis \r\nof coordination and consultation. \r\nTurning specifically to the many concepts and recommendations contained \r\nin \"An Agenda for Peace\", my delegation would like to express some views, \r\nwithout prejudice to further deliberations, which we believe should be \r\nundertaken in the working group whose creation was today suggested by the \r\nrepresentative of Argentina on behalf of the countries members of the Rio \r\nGroup. \r\nPreventive-diplomacy activities should be conducted strictly in \r\naccordance with Chapter VI of the Charter. Peacemaking activities should be \r\nguided by the definition contained in resolution 46/48, which was adopted last \r\nyear. Peace-keeping operations, for their part, should scrupulously follow \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n60 \r\n(MrT Sardenberg. Brazil) \r\nthe principles and practices accumulated by the Organization in acquiring \r\nexperience in these matters. In view of the limited nature of existing \r\nprecedents concerning the enforcement activities undertaken under Chapter VII, \r\nsuggestions and recommendations as to their future modalities should be \r\nthoroughly and carefully examined by the membership at large. Post-conflict \r\npeace-building is still an evolving idea to be carefully implemented in \r\naccordance with the needs and wishes of the parties concerned. Thorough \r\nattention should be given to the task of preventive peace-building, taking \r\ninto account the overall mandate and resources of the United Nations system. \r\nMy delegation believes that there is a need for greater communication and \r\ndialogue between the Security Council, the General Assembly and the \r\nSecretary-General in the field of international peace and security. In the \r\nlight of Article 24, there is a need for enhanced transparency in the \r\nCouncil\u0027s deliberative and decision-making processes; a need for more \r\neffective consultations with United Nations Members who are not members of the \r\nCouncil; and a need for the Council to listen to the wider membership of the \r\nOrganization. In this respect, the annual report submitted by the Security \r\nCouncil to the General Assembly pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article 24 is an \r\nimportant instrument, which should be made less formal, less opaque and more \r\nsubstantive. \r\nWe welcome the trend to make the activities of the Secretariat more \r\ntransparent and more accountable to all Member States. Early-warning \r\ninformation collected by the United Nations system should be made available \r\npromptly and systematically to the Member States concerned, as they are the \r\nparties most interested in prompt and appropriate action. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n61 \r\n(Mr. Sardenberg. Brazil) \r\nOn the subject of financing, the specific suggestions contained in \"An \r\nAgenda for Peace\" and in the report of the Secretary-General on the work of \r\nthe Organization should be subjected to a thorough examination by the proper \r\nsubsidiary organs of the General Assembly. The special scale of assessment \r\nfor the financing of peace-keeping operations recognizes the special \r\nresponsibilities of the permanent members of the Security Council and reflects \r\nthe effective capacity of Member States to pay, which is not reflected as \r\nclearly as it should be in the regular budget. \r\nAs was clearly stated in the Rio Group document of 28 May 1992: \r\n\"Considerations of political and economic realism make the current \r\nfinancing system the only viable mechanism. It is therefore necessary to \r\nmake the system predictable and stable by adopting permanently the \r\ncurrent system of contributions for the financing of peace-keeping \r\noperations established under General Assembly resolution 3101 (XXVIII) \r\nand subsequent resolutions.\" (A/47/232, annex, para. 22) \r\nAs crisis after crisis unfolds in this rapidly evolving world situation, \r\nnew, and at times unprecedented. United Nations operations and missions are \r\nbeing promptly decided upon and set up and quickly dispatched to different \r\nareas of the world. Not all of these operations or missions can properly be \r\ncalled \"peace-keeping\" operations. The decisions on those operations and \r\nmissions are difficult decisions that have in most cases been taken under the \r\npressure of time and circumstances and on an ad hoc basis. \r\nThe maintenance of international peace and security should be a shared \r\nendeavour of the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Secretariat, the \r\nrelevant regional organizations and the States involved in specific \r\nsituations. The complexities and diverse nature of crisis situations make it \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Sardenberg. Brazil) \r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to have recourse to standardized mechanisms. \r\nEach crisis is unique. \r\nBut it is clear that decisions must be based on the consistent and \r\nnon-selective application of the provisions of the Charter. The General \r\nAssembly has yet to develop and adopt a clear set of guidelines for these \r\noperations, which have become a central aspect of the activity of our \r\nOrganization. That is an important and urgent part of the task ahead of us in \r\nthe days and weeks to come. \r\nUltimately, the prestige and legitimacy of the United Nations role in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security rests on the good governance \r\nof the Organization itself. That can be ensured in the functioning of the \r\nrelevant organs by means of transparency, equity, representation, \r\naccountability and mutuality of benefits and obligations on a \r\nnon-discriminatory basis. We must see to it that the functions and powers of \r\neach organ, as well as its composition, ensure efficiency and authority. In \r\ndeepening our deliberations on the building of a new peace agenda, we should \r\nkeep in mind the need to apply these parameters consistently in the \r\ninstitutional and functional restructuring of the relevant bodies of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\nMr. HIDALGO BASULTO (Cuba) (interpretation from Spanish): Today we \r\nare considering two documents of fundamental importance to the United Nations \r\nand to its future: the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization since his assumption of his office and the document entitled \"An \r\nAgenda for Peace\", submitted by the Secretary-General purusant to the request \r\nmade to him by the Security Council at its meeting on 31 January 1992. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. Hidaloo Basulto. Cuba) \r\nWe are particularly grateful to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his \r\ninitiative in making this second text available to the forty-seventh session \r\nof the General Assembly; it has already been receiving, because of its \r\nimplications, the most careful attention of the whole international community, \r\nand not only of the small group of countries that requested its preparation. \r\nWe also welcome the fact that a substantive debate is taking place this \r\nyear on the now traditional General Assembly agenda item 10. We believe that \r\na broad and in-depth discussion of the information furnished us by the \r\nSecretary-General from year to year with regard to the tasks undertaken by the \r\nUnited Nations and the Organization\u0027s prospects, as well as his own perception \r\nof the future, should become a sound practice of the General Assembly, and \r\nshould not be held only when a specific text arouses our interest. \r\nWhile we shall try to refer so far as possible to both documents, which \r\ncomplement each other to a considerable degree, we will focus primarily on \r\n\"Agenda for Peace\", given its importance to the future role being planned for \r\nthe United Nations. \r\nAs we see it, a series of elements necessarily come together in any \r\nanalysis of this document. If we disregard them we risk arriving at mistaken \r\nor incomplete conclusions, with all the consequences that that would entail \r\nfor the development of truly democratic procedures within the Organization and \r\nfor the preservation of its independence as the representative of the \r\nplurality of interests that coexist, and must continue to coexist, within it. \r\nThe Secretary-General himself, in his historic statement at the Tenth \r\nConference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, recently \r\nheld in Jakarta, Indonesia, underscored aspects of the contemporary \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n64 \r\n(Mr. Hidaloo Basulto. Cuba) \r\ninternational scene that are already setting trends within the United Nations \r\nand that are thus inevitably a part of the analysis we are beginning today, \r\naspects that must to a considerable extent guide us to our conclusions. \r\nOn that occasion we were reminded by the Secretary-General that \r\n\"The temptation to dominate, either world-wide or regionally, remains.\" \r\nHe also alerted us to the fact that that temptation \r\n\"threatens the weaker and poorer States, which are still the most \r\nnumerous in the world.\" \r\nThe thrust of Mr. Boutros-Ghali\"s statement was to urge the non-aligned \r\ncountries, the weakest, poorest and most numerous States of the planet, not to \r\ngive in to defeatism, but, rather, to help the United Nations in the efforts \r\nit must make to confront the situation, to speak out and to remain faithful \r\n\"unflinchingly faithful,\" in his inspired words - to the concept of national \r\nsovereignty, the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of \r\nStates and the practice of real economic cooperation. \r\nThe principles emphasized by the Secretary-General should be strictly \r\nobserved, without exception and without discrimination of any kind, and \r\nmechanisms should be designed to defend the Organization against any \r\ntemptation to use it as an instrument, either voluntary or involuntary, for \r\nviolating those principles or exercising policies of domination. We are \r\nconvinced that that would constitute the best, most complete and most \r\neffective agenda for peace we could design within the framework of our \r\ninternational Organization and in defence of the concepts enshrined in the \r\nCharter. \r\nIn that connection,we must express our concern and unease over the \r\ndevelopment within the United Nations of certain concepts, practices and \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n65 \r\n(Mr. Hidalgo Basulto. Cuba) \r\ntrends that flagrantly contradict the principles I have just mentioned. We \r\nalso note with equal concern that the document we are beginning to consider \r\nnot only fails to suggest measures to curb those phenomena, but includes \r\nconcepts and proposes mechanisms that would tend, in practice, to strengthen \r\nthem. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n66 \r\n(Mr. Hidaloo Basulto. Cuba) \r\nTo Cuba, any idea that tends to introduce criteria that would limit State \r\nsovereignty, or any sort of conduct that smacks of intervention or \r\ninterference in the internal affairs of States Members of the Organization, \r\nis unacceptable, in whatever guise and under whatever pretext. By the same \r\ntoken, we cannot accept absolute concepts of democracy that are based on \r\nmodels that are foreign to us and that generally correspond to those of the \r\nold colonial Powers. In our view, the essence of democracy lies in allowing \r\npeoples to exercise self-determination on the basis of their own cultures, \r\ntheir own values, their own traditions, their own historical experience and \r\ntheir own religious beliefs, free of outside attempts, especially on the part \r\nof an Organization such as the United Nations, to exercise power and influence \r\nover them. \r\nWhat sort of democracy is it when a small group of countries, taking \r\nrefuge behind the Organization, arrogate to themselves the almost-boundless \r\npower of making war; when they feel entitled to meddle in affairs that \r\nrightfully fall under the jurisdiction of other States; when, in clandestine \r\ncouncils where no one knows exactly what is happening, they impose their own \r\ninterests, picking and choosing which matters they will act on and which ones \r\nthey will simply ignore; when they are constantly trying to augment that power \r\nby assuming functions not their own, interpreting the Charter at their whim \r\nand intervening in activities within the exclusive domain, either of States \r\nthemselves or of other bodies of this institution? \r\nAgainst that backdrop, if we allow the advancement of ideas that tend to \r\ngrant even more power to the powerful, if we help them in their endeavour to \r\npursue a policy of domination by manipulating our Organization, will we not, \r\nby acts of commission or omission, be making it easier, to violate the \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n67 \r\n(Mr. Hidalgo Basulto. Cuba) \r\nprinciples to which the Secretary-General referred and which should be gaining \r\nin sanctity as the cornerstone of all our actions in this unstable, unipolar \r\nworld? Did the Secretary-General himself not remind us in Jakarta that in \r\naccordance with Article 2, paragraph 7 of the Charter, the United Nations \r\nwould never interfere in the internal affairs of a State, either under the \r\ncover of preventive diplomacy or for the sake of humanitarian action? \r\nWould the acceptance of some of the proposed mechanisms not be a call to \r\nundermine the position of the Secretary-General, as expounded in an address to \r\nmore than 108 Members of the Organization, when in fact we should all be \r\nsupporting him so that he can fulfil that solemn promise that he made to the \r\nnon-aligned countries? \r\nIf we really want our Organization to play the role for which it was \r\nconceived, expressed with the utmost clarity in the purposes and principles \r\nthat make up the very basis of the Charter, we have no choice but to create a \r\ngenuine climate of confidence in the United Nations. In no way can that be \r\nachieved through the random and unrestricted application of the operational \r\nmechanisms proposed in the document entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\". In our \r\nview, at least, that is not the way to gain the confidence of the poorest, \r\nweakest and most numerous States in the world. \r\nIf we really want democracy, confidence and a community of interests to \r\nprevail in the United Nations, for the attainment of the peace and security to \r\nwhich we all aspire, then instead of giving more power to the powerful by \r\nincreasing the Security Council\u0027s exercise of its powers, which would \r\ninevitably result from the application of the mechanisms proposed in that \r\ndocument, we should, on the contrary, radically reform the Council, prevent it \r\nfrom assuming functions that are not within its mandate, as it does by \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n68 \r\n(Mr. Hidalgo Basulto. Cuba) \r\ninterfering in the internal affairs of States. We should redefine the \r\nconditions of permanent membership, do away with the antidemocratic and \r\nantiquated privilege of veto, limit the uses and abuses of Chapter VII of the \r\nCharter and give the Council a membership, structure and operational \r\nprocedures that are in line with the aspirations of the majority of nations \r\nrepresented in this Hall and that reflect the objective changes that have \r\ntaken place on the international scene since the founding of our Organization \r\nalmost 50 years ago. \r\nIn paragraph 169 of his report, the Secretary-General points out that \r\n\"Democracy within the family of nations means the application of its \r\nprinciples within the world Organization itself.\" (A/47/1, para. 169) \r\nHe then goes on to say, \r\n\"Preserving the moral authority of the United Nations requires the \r\nfullest consultation, participation and engagement of all States, large \r\nand small, in the work of the United Nations.\" (ibid.) \r\nViewed in this framework, the document entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\" \r\nlacks a clear, appropriate and consistent assessment of the responsibilities \r\nof the General Assembly and its obligations vis-a-vis the Security Council. \r\nIn short, it should not be forgotten that the Council acts, or at least it \r\nshould act, according to the Charter, on behalf of all States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations, to which it is answerable. Therefore, it is the General \r\nAssembly the only United Nations organ in which we are all represented \r\nthat must bear responsibility for discharging the tasks of effectively \r\nsupervising the work of the Council, preventing abuses of power and hegemonic \r\ntendencies within it and drawing up the necessary recommendations so that that \r\nbody\u0027s functioning will be more democratic and more transparent. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n69 \r\n(Mr. Hidalgo Basulto. Cuba) \r\nWe are pleased that in the introduction to his report the \r\nSecretary-General reaffirms that his fundamental priority is the full \r\napplication of the principles of democracy between nations and within our \r\nOrganization. That statement encourages us and gives us hope that in the \r\nnot-too-distant future Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali will propose concrete \r\nmeasures to turn that laudable aspiration from words into deeds. \r\nWe cannot fail to note that while the report of the Secretary-General \r\ndoes attach due importance to the work of the United Nations in connection \r\nwith international economic cooperation for development, whether or not we are \r\nin agreement with all the elements included therein, that dimension is, for \r\nall practical purposes, absent from the document entitled \"An Agenda for \r\nPeace\". Lest we forget, the revitalization of a strategy for the \r\ncomprehensive development of the third world and the eradication of poverty, \r\nilliteracy and poor sanitary conditions, to mention just a few of the problems \r\ntragically afflicting the countries of the South, should be at the very centre \r\nof United Nations attention. There can be no peace in the world until the \r\ninternational economic system is substantively altered for the sake of the \r\neconomic and social advancement of the underdeveloped countries. \r\nBut in order to achieve that end, the structures of the United Nations \r\nmust operate effectively, not only at the level of technical or humanitarian \r\nassistance but also in the very planning and implementation of a global \r\nstrategy for sustainable development based on justice and equity. \r\nIt is essential to strengthen the functions of the General Assembly and \r\nits democratic machinery and not yield to the ideas of some who, on the \r\ncontrary, aim to weaken the powers of this principal organ in that sphere, or \r\nto the designs of others whose intention it is to do away totally with role of \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n70 \r\n(Mr. Hidalgo Basulto. Cuba) \r\nour Organization in the field of economic and social development. To allow \r\nthis would be to contradict the very words of the Secretary-General, who notes \r\nin paragraph 57 of his report, \r\n\"...the United Nations as an institution is uniquely placed to press for \r\nglobal solutions to global problems in the economic field whether they \r\npertain to aid, trade, technology transfer, commodity prices or debt \r\nrelief.\" (A/47/1, para. 57) \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n71 \r\n(Mr. Hidalgo Basulto. Cuba) \r\nNot to resolve in the short term the development problems affecting the \r\nthird world, however hard we work towards eliminating the unfortunate problems \r\nthat occur - and unfortunately they will continue to occur in different \r\nareas of the South, would be tantamount to contradicting the conviction \r\nexpressed by the Secretary-General himself in Jakarta, to the effect that \r\n\"As long as underdevelopment persists, with its long train of frustration \r\nand violence, none of our victories, however remarkable, will be assured \r\nfor any length of time.\" \r\nIt is obvious that the United Nations Secretariat, with its experience \r\nand its efficiency, must play a role of a far-reaching nature in any effort to \r\nstrengthen the Organization and to facilitate the task of each one of its \r\norgans in carrying out the functions for which it was conceived. We believe \r\nthat in this framework, geographical distribution within the Secretariat must \r\nbe inspired by democratic ideas akin to those that should inspire the rest of \r\nour Organization. It is not and would not be acceptable for Secretariat \r\nposts, including higher posts, to be preassigned to persons of a determined \r\nnationality, however powerful their countries of origin may be. Hence we must \r\nwarmly welcome paragraph 42 of the report of the Secretary-General, in which \r\nwe are told that there is an intention to avoid the politicization of the \r\nSecretariat and to resist pressures from outside that favour a few at the \r\nexpense of the majority. Mr. Boutros-Ghali can rely on Cuba\u0027s complete \r\nsupport in this undertaking, and we hope that the changes that take place in \r\nthe future in the organizational chart, including the higher posts, will be a \r\nreflection of that resolve. \r\nThe document \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277) proposes to us a series of \r\nconcrete ideas that would lead to operational mechanisms that require at least \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n72 \r\n(Mr. Hidalgo Basulto. Cuba) \r\nsome preliminary comment. Suffice it to say that like most of the States \r\nMembers of our Organization, we are encouraged by the proposal to strengthen \r\nthe capacity of the United Nations to avoid threats to international peace and \r\nsecurity. None the less, we do note with concern how some of the concepts \r\npervading the report, its structure and important omissions in the description \r\nof the operational mechanisms suggested seem to reflect a lack of certain \r\ncardinal principles that should inevitably govern our work. \r\nI should like to refer by way of example to the subject of preventive \r\ndiplomacy, where the principles of national sovereignty, territorial integrity \r\nand non-interference in internal affairs must be fully respected, just as the \r\nprinciple of prior request and consent of a State to which it is planned that \r\na fact-finding mission be sent must be respected. \r\nAlong the same lines, and also by way of example, we feel that the \r\nconcept of preventive diplomacy which is mentioned in the document is not \r\nreflected clearly enough for all of its implications to be fully understood. \r\nEverything would seem to indicate that reference is being made to problems \r\nthat are exclusively national in other words, internal - over which, \r\naccording to the Charter, the Organization would not have jurisdiction, and \r\nalso to the initiation of operations in the course of which it would be easy \r\nto violate the sovereignty of a State. The same applies to the list of \r\nsituations that might constitute a threat to the peace, whose length and \r\ndegree of generality could lead to interpretations that are potentially \r\nharmful to the real application of the above-mentioned principles. \r\nIs it our intention to have the Organization and its structures devote \r\ntheir best efforts to our monitoring each other? \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n73 \r\n(Mr. Hidalgo Basulto. Cuba) \r\nLikewise, paragraph 44, on the \"peace-enforcement units\", also contains \r\nelements that are of concern as far as preservation of the sovereignty and \r\nintegrity of States Members of our Organization is concerned; and \r\nparagraph 59, which refers to \r\n\"support for the transformation of deficient national structures and \r\ncapabilities, and for the strengthening of new democratic institutions\", \r\nwould seem to be aimed at imposing upon sovereign countries pre-determined \r\nmodels arbitrarily defined, such as the ones to which we have already referred. \r\nAll of this, as we see it, shows that the document \"An Agenda for Peace\" \r\nrequires profound study and a much more detailed debate than the one we are \r\nconducting now or that we are able to conduct now, and that it is necessary \r\nfor us to devise ways of promoting that discussion and of determining what we \r\nare all prepared to accept and what, because of its implications, we should \r\nreject. We support the proposal for the establishment of a working group of \r\nthe General Assembly devoted to this task. \r\nI should like, finally, to thank the Secretary-General for introducing a \r\ndocument which, although it does not necessarily command general support on \r\neach and every one of its aspects, does have the great merit of compelling us \r\nall to think about the future of our Organization under the new conditions of \r\nour world today, and which was certainly prepared with the commendable \r\nintention of strengthening the United Nations at a time when, in spite of all \r\nour efforts, dangers still outweigh hopes. \r\nMr. OSVALD (Sweden): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the \r\nfive Nordic countries, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. \r\nThe Nordic countries welcome the Secretary-General\u0027s report \"An Agenda \r\nfor Peace\" (A/47/277). We have studied it with appreciation. The report \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n74-75 \r\n(Mr, Qsvald. Sweden) \r\ndeals with crucial issues of principle and policy that merit a thorough \r\ndiscussion by the General Assembly, the Security Council and other relevant \r\nUnited Nations forums. \r\nIn the document \"Shaping the Peace: The United Nations in the 1990s\" of \r\n23 October 1991 (A/46/591), the Nordic countries have put forward proposals on \r\npossible elements for an integrated United Nations approach to peace-making, \r\npeace-keeping and, as a last resort, enforcement action. \r\nIn a message to the Summit Meeting of the Security Council, \"The \r\nReykjavik Statement on the United Nations\" of 22 January 1992 (S/23457, \r\nannex), we have further elaborated on how to improve the capability of the \r\nUnited Nations in these areas. Moreover, Nordic proposals have been presented \r\nin the Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations and on other occasions. \r\nA strong United Nations is our best hope for coping with the conflicts \r\nemerging in the post-cold-war era. Ethnic conflicts, situations of grave \r\nimplications in humanitarian terms, massive violations of human rights, \r\nthreatening environmental disasters and economic and social injustices call \r\nfor urgent action. Our foremost task must be to identify ways and means of \r\ndealing effectively with these challenges. \r\n\"The end of the cold war has provided an unprecedented opportunity to \r\nstrengthen the United Nations. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n76 \r\n(Mr. Osvald. Sweden) \r\nIn the new international climate of cooperation, the General Assembly can \r\nreaffirm its responsibility as an authoritative forum for discussion and \r\naction on international issues, and the Security Council has begun to fulfil \r\nmore effectively its primary responsibility for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\nWe welcome the strengthened role of the Security Council. It is \r\nimportant that the decisions of the Security Council enjoy wide support from \r\nMember States. This requires close cooperation between members of the \r\nSecurity Council and other Members of the United Nations. \r\nIn the view of the Nordic countries, one of the messages in \"An Agenda \r\nfor Peace\" can be found on the conceptual level. Building on an emerging \r\ninternational consensus and on the statement from the summit meeting of the \r\nSecurity Council, the Secretary-General introduces a broadened security \r\nconcept. Security can no longer be seen only in a military perspective. \r\nOther sources of instability in the economic, social, humanitarian and \r\necological fields are increasingly considered threats to international peace \r\nand security. \r\nThe Nordic countries endorse the Secretary-General\u0027s views in this \r\nregard. Lasting peace and security can be achieved when the necessary \r\neconomic, social and environmental conditions are in place, when human rights \r\nare respected and the principles of democracy are applied. \r\nPost-conflict peace-building and long-term economic and social \r\ndevelopment can thus not be separated from security issues. As underlined in \r\nthe Secretary-General\u0027s report on the work of the Organization, an integrated \r\napproach is required. A stronger United Nations in the field of international \r\npeace and security must go hand in hand with reformed and revitalized \r\nstructures in the areas of economic and social development. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n77 \r\n(Mr. Osvald. Sweden) \r\nWe cannot avoid the difficult, but necessary, discussion on how to strike \r\na balance between the principle of national sovereignty and the need for \r\ncollective international action to deal with threatening situations, while \r\nacting within the United Nations Charter. Otherwise, the United Nations may \r\nnot be able effectively to promote solutions to conflicts that are internal in \r\na geographical sense but may have far-reaching international ramifications. \r\nThe Nordic countries strongly support the Secretary-General\u0027s view that \r\npreventive diplomacy is the most desirable and efficient way to defuse \r\ntensions or contain conflicts. The Secretary-General should be provided with \r\nthe necessary resources to carry out effectively his role under Article 99 of \r\nthe Charter. \r\nAccess to adequate, accurate and timely information and analysis is of \r\nfundamental importance for the Secretary-General, the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council when considering preventive action. \r\nWe believe that the Organization should rationalize and enhance its \r\ncapability to collect, analyse and disseminate information on situations that \r\nmight develop into conflicts. This capability should encompass early warning, \r\nincluding assessment of global trends. Information-sharing by Member States \r\nas well as non-governmental organizations to the United Nations can provide \r\nvaluable input. An operative link must be established between the collection \r\nand analysis of information and subsequent action by relevant United Nations \r\nbodies. \r\nThe Nordic\u0027countries welcome the dispatch of fact-finding missions by the \r\nSecretary-General to areas of potential or actual conflict and would like to \r\nsee this practice developed and expanded. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n78 \r\n(Mr. Osvald. Sweden) \r\nInformation on levels of armaments, conventional as well as weapons of \r\nmass destruction, and on transfers of arms-related technology is crucial for \r\nearly warning and thus for preventive action. The Nordic countries welcome \r\nthe establishment of the Register of Conventional Arms. \r\nWe furthermore encourage the General Assembly, the Security Council and \r\nthe Secretary-General to continue to take appropriate action to prevent the \r\nproliferation of weapons especially weapons of mass destruction to areas \r\nof potential or actual conflict. The Security Council should consider taking \r\na greater role in ensuring compliance with disarmament, arms control and \r\nnon-proliferation instruments. \r\nAccess to information, not least for early-warning purposes, may be \r\nenhanced by establishing an appropriate system for information-sharing between \r\nregional arrangements and organizations and the United Nations. This should \r\ninclude information-sharing on confidence-building measures. \r\nThe Nordic countries see a promising potential for increased cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations also in other areas, \r\nsuch as peacemaking and peace-keeping. \r\nAt the summit meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope (CSCE) in Helsinki, the CSCE explicitly pronounced itself as a regional \r\norganization as defined in the United Nations Charter. The basis for \r\nstrengthening the coordination and cooperation between the CSCE and the United \r\nNations has thus been laid in the areas I have mentioned. \r\nThe Nordic countries agree with the Secretary-General that preventive \r\ndeployment of peace-keeping forces as a deterrent to potential armed conflict \r\nshould be considered. Specific situations may arise when monitors or a \r\npeace-keeping force might be deployed for preventive purposes at the request \r\nof only one of the parties concerned, on that party\u0027s side of a border. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n79 \r\n(Mr. Osvald. Sweden) \r\nThe setting up of demilitarized zones can also, as proposed by the \r\nSecretary-General, be a useful preventive measure. \r\nPeacemaking activities, which may include good offices, mediation, \r\nconciliation and other diplomatic efforts, should play an increasingly \r\nimportant role in the settlement of disputes. However, to be effective, these \r\nactivities must be provided with the necessary political support and adequate \r\nresources. \r\nIn the view of the Nordic countries, the peacemaking and peace-keeping \r\nactivities of the United Nations are interdependent. Coordination should be \r\nimproved and enhanced among the relevant bodies of the United Nations system \r\nin these areas. \r\nTraditional peacemaking activities may in many cases be supplemented by \r\nadvisory services and training to facilitate peaceful settlements of disputes \r\nand a transition to democracy. Contributions by Member States to the \r\nestablishment of a stand-by pool of qualified personnel in the fields of \r\nelectoral assistance, human rights and civilian administration would be \r\nhelpful in this regard. \r\nAn evaluation mechanism should be developed within the Secretariat with \r\nthe purpose of systematically collecting, analysing and retaining experience \r\ngained from peacemaking activities, and this could prove useful in other \r\nsimilar situations. \r\nAs pointed out in \"An Agenda for Peace\", the International Court of \r\nJustice remains an underused resource for the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes. Parties to a dispute should use the Court more frequently. Member \r\nStates should accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the court. Increased use \r\nshould be made of the possibility to request the advisory opinion of the Court \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n80 \r\n(Mr. Osvald. Sweden) \r\non legal issues in order to prevent or defuse a conflict. The Nordic \r\ncountries fully endorse the recommendation of the Secretary-General to support \r\nthe Trust Fund established to assist countries who cannot afford the cost of \r\nbringing a dispute to the Court. \r\nThe Security Council should consider the use of warnings and sanctions \r\nagainst parties that are patently unwilling to solve peacefully conflicts that \r\nthreaten international peace and security. To improve the readiness to act in \r\nthis regard, the Security Council might consider initiating a study on the \r\neffectiveness and management of different types of sanctions. Special \r\nconsideration should be given to the problem of how better to alleviate the \r\nburden on third countries that are confronted with special economic problems \r\nas a result of such sanctions. \r\nIn \"An Agenda for Peace\" the Secretary-General brings up the question of \r\na special arrangement between Member States and the United Nations in order to \r\nmake armed forces available to the United Nations on a permanent basis. He \r\nfurthermore introduces the new concept of peace-enforcement units. \r\nThe possibilities of the Charter in this regard have not yet been fully \r\nexplored. The ideas of the Secretary-General are very important and merit \r\nserious consideration. We are prepared to participate in a discussion aiming \r\nat the broadest possible agreement. \r\nThe Nordic countries welcome the innovative approach and flexibility \r\ndemonstrated by the Secretary-General and the Security Council in mounting \r\nincreasingly complex and diverse United Nations operations when dealing with \r\nthreats to international peace and security. However, in order to cope with \r\nthe ever-increasing demands, it is essential that the peace-keeping operations \r\nbe put on a sound and secure financial basis through assessed contributions. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n81 \r\n(Mr. Osvald. Sweden) \r\nMember States must pay their assessed contributions for peace-keeping \r\nactivities in full and on time. The overall funding of the Organization must \r\nrest on the collective responsibility of the entire membership. It is also \r\nimportant that troop-contributing countries be guaranteed that the United \r\nNations will honour its obligations to make adequate and timely reimbursements \r\nto them. One of the priority tasks of the General Assembly at this session is \r\nto decide to establish a system for funding the initial phase of peace-keeping \r\noperations. \r\nThe Nordic countries would like to reiterate their strong support for the \r\nestablishment of a reserve fund to secure the financing of the start-up phase \r\nof peace-keeping operations. Both the Secretary-General and his predecessor \r\nhave put special emphasis on this idea. \r\nAdequate organizational structures must also be created to deal with the \r\nnew challenges in peace-keeping. The organization and operation of United \r\nNations peace-keeping must be streamlined as much as possible. An integrated \r\norganizational and command structure would enhance effectiveness and \r\ncoordination. On matters such as personnel, equipment, logistics and training \r\nthe Special Committee on Peace-Keeping Operations provides a forum for \r\nin-depth discussions. The Nordic countries will continue to present concrete \r\nproposals in that Committee and to participate actively in its work. We have \r\nnoted with appreciation the idea, put forward by the President of the United \r\nStates in the general debate, of holding a special meeting of the Security \r\nCouncil to discuss various practical aspects of peace-keeping operations. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n82 \r\n(Mr. Osvald. Sweden) \r\nThe Nordic countries participate in practically all United Nations \r\npeace-keeping operations. We reiterate our offer to share our experience by \r\nproviding advice and training to countries which are now preparing for \r\npeace-keeping missions. \r\nSuccessful peacemaking and peace-keeping efforts frequently need to be \r\nfollowed by post-conflict peace-building measures. Peace must be \r\nconsolidated; support must be given to new democratic structures; and a sense \r\nof confidence and hope for the future must be created in countries previously \r\nravaged by war. These problems are currently being addressed by the United \r\nNations in complex operations in, for example, Cambodia, El Salvador, Angola \r\nand Mozambique. We support such a comprehensive approach to peace-building. \r\nWe are prepared to consider how best to contribute to reconstruction projects, \r\nde-mining, the repatriation of refugees, training of civilian police or other \r\nactivities within the framework of peace-building. \r\nTo conclude, let me summarize the views of the Nordic countries in three \r\npoints: \r\nFirst, the Nordic countries strongly support the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\napproach in \"An Agenda for Peace\". That document is very timely and contains \r\nseveral proposals that should be implemented without delay. \r\nSecondly, decisive measures should be taken to close the gap between the \r\nincreasing and ever more complex demands on the Organization and its present \r\ncapabilities and resources. Several proposals of the Secretary-General \r\naddress this problem. They should be followed up. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n83 \r\n(Mr. Osvald. Sweden) \r\nThirdly, immediate action should be taken to strengthen the United \r\nNations capability for preventive diplomacy and to establish a reserve fund to \r\nsecure the financing of the start-up phase of peace-keeping operations. \r\nWe are prepared to take part in a comprehensive consideration of the \r\nideas and proposals in the Secretary-General\u0027s report. The aim should be to \r\nreach consensus on a series of proposals that could be implemented without \r\ndelay. The establishment of an open-ended working-group of the Assembly could \r\nbe a mechanism for achieving this goal. Given the large number of proposals \r\nand the complexity of the issues, such a procedure would benefit from the \r\nactive involvement of the relevant organs of the General Assembly in \r\nelaborating the proposals, as suggested by the European Community. \r\nWe must not miss this opportunity to contribute to a stronger United \r\nNations. To quote the Secretary-General\u0027s words in \"An Agenda for Peace\", \r\n\"Now is the time for its nations and peoples, and the men and women who \r\nserve it, to seize the moment for the sake of the future.\" (A/47/277. \r\npara. 86) \r\nMr. RAZALI (Malaysia): Our discussion today is based on the report \r\nof the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization, document A/47/1 of \r\n11 September 1992, and the report of the Secretary-General pursuant to the \r\nstatement adopted by the summit meeting of the Security Council on \r\n31 January 1992, document A/47/277 of 17 June 1992. I must congratulate the \r\nSecretary-General on both documents; both are constructive, forward-looking \r\nand action-oriented. I must congratulate those concerned on the innovative \r\nstep of having the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n84 \r\n(Mr. Razali. Malaysia) \r\nOrganization discussed in plenary meeting. I hope this practice will continue \r\nin the future. The two reports reinforce each other and seek to promote the \r\nUnited Nations and its activities in a proactive light, taking on the \r\nchallenges ahead. \r\nAs a third-world country, a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and of the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, and a member of the Group of 77, \r\nMalaysia obviously places considerable trust and expectation in the United \r\nNations, even if we were not around in 1945 to be responsible for the manner \r\nof its inception. Having inherited a United Nations made very much in the \r\nimage of a few specifically the victorious Powers we seek every \r\nopportunity now to effect change in the Organization. We believe that we have \r\nnow reached such a moment, a point in time where reasonable hopes can be \r\nexpected from changes in the United Nations. We realize that despite dramatic \r\nand qualitative developments affecting the Organization and the international \r\nscene, change within the United Nations and in relations among States \r\nconducted within the United Nations system cannot happen overnight; neither \r\ncan it be revolutionary. Change will have to be a process conditioned by time \r\nand many other factors and, as the Secretary-General said in his report on the \r\nwork of the Organization, it will be neither easy nor risk free. But one \r\nthing is certain: there must be change. We must not make any irreversible \r\nmistake that will make posterity condemn us for not taking advantage of a \r\nhistoric opportunity. \r\nThe end of the cold war is generally accepted as having been a turning \r\npoint in the affairs of the world: after 45 years, countries do not have to \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n85 \r\n(Mr. Razali. Malaysia) \r\nlive under the shadow or threat of being vassals of one so-called super-Power \r\nor the other. We are now determined that there will never be a recurrence of \r\nthe situation where the world is divided into two blocs and where that \r\nconflict subsumes all other important issues, such as the dire need for \r\ndevelopment in the South. Malaysia does not agree that it was communism that \r\nmired the world for 45 years; more accurately, it was the grand ambition of \r\nthe super-Powers that made the entire globe the cockpit of its rivalry. \r\nThere is a lot of ground to be made up after the neglect of those years. \r\nThis is applicable to the United Nations itself as an organization. The \r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of the^Organization clearly \r\nindicates the Secretary-General\u0027s readiness to undertake the necessary changes \r\nin the Organization. We wish the Secretary-General and his team well. At the \r\nsame time, we urge that the widest consultations be attempted in the process. \r\nThe Secretary-General will be exposed to many views, some more pervasive than \r\nothers. The end of the cold war and the changing times do not mean the end of \r\nthe pursuit of primacy of positions and ideas. Those that have profited from \r\nthe United Nations as structured in 1945 will fight rearguard actions to \r\nperpetuate their advantages. In the circumstances, it is incumbent on the \r\nthird world, through the Non-Aligned Movement or the Group of 77, or \r\nindividually, to hold strong to their collective views. \r\nThe bottom line is that the United Nations of tshe future must clearly be \r\non the side of the world\u0027s majority. It must be attentive and caring to the \r\nproblems of that majority. Any change in the United Nations through \r\nrestructuring or revitalization must result in maximizing the opportunity for \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n85(a-z) \r\n(Mr. Razali. Malaysia) \r\nthe South and the third world to place their problems before the Organization \r\nfor attention and redress. It is in that context that we in the South must \r\nmake our views known as much as possible. We must take the Secretary-General \r\nat his word; we must have faith in his invitation to dialogue. We must not \r\nlet the few continue to influence the United Nations. We should set targets \r\nperhaps by 1995 for discernable changes within the United Nations to be \r\nfirmly set in train. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n86 \r\n(Mr. Razali. Malaysia) \r\nIn the report on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General \r\nsingled out the areas the United Nations would concentrate on. These are: \r\nglobal partnership for development; managing crises and peaceful settlements; \r\nand humanitarian assistance and democratization. In the other document, also \r\nknown as \"An Agenda for Peace\", the Secretary-General elaborated on the role \r\nof the Security Council and the role of the Secretary-General in pursuit of \r\npeace and security. It is clear that for all these objectives the United \r\nNations as an institution must be demonstrably efficient and motivated as well \r\nas clearly represent the majority and the collective aspirations of its \r\nmembership. \r\nIn his first year of office the Secretary-General has undertaken many \r\nbold changes which have been supported by us. He has put in motion efforts to \r\nmake the Secretariat a viable force for undertaking actions related to \r\npolicy-setting, to research and analysis and to financing, coordinating and \r\nexecuting operational activities. Some countries have in the past felt that \r\nthe Secretariat had gone amiss on some of these priorities, and they will now \r\nexpect better performance in the years ahead. \r\nIn the second phase of the restructuring to be undertaken by the \r\nSecretary-General, we would like to see more tangible progress. The time of \r\ninterdepartmental and interagency disputes and jockeying for position must be \r\na chapter of the past. We expect the Secretary-General, through an \r\ninvigorated Administrative Committee on Coordination, to ensure that this is \r\nso. \r\nIn the context of the United Nations as a vehicle to effect a global \r\npartnership for development, the record of the past is not a meritorious one. \r\nEven in the present context, many countries like Malaysia are concerned that \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n87 \r\n(Mr. Razali. Malaysia) \r\nthe United Nations has diverted time and energy more to problems related to \r\npeace and security than to the needs of the South. The report of the \r\nSecretary-General itself states that political progress and economic \r\ndevelopment are inseparable, that both are equally important and that they \r\nmust be pursued simultaneously. In the new climate of international relations \r\nwe must not miss the opportunity to develop at the United Nations the \r\nnecessary international consensus and policy instruments to promote this \r\nintegrated approach. The 45 years of neglect of the South due to the cold war \r\nmust be made up very quickly, and we in the South are looking to the United \r\nNations for this. \r\nThe last four decades have seen the marginalization of the United Nations \r\nitself, which on policies and factors affecting the condition and well-being \r\nof the South, has been overtaken by bodies such as Bretton Woods. It will be \r\n\u0027 an impossible task to bring these issues completely back to the United \r\n8 \r\nNations, but there must now be a clear linkage between what happens at Bretton \r\n1!: . . . \r\nWoods and what would be attempted at the United Nations. The world\u0027s majority \r\nas reposed in the United Nations must have a say in the critical decisions \r\ntaken at bodies such as Bretton Woods and the Group of 7. The decisions of \r\n*Bretton Woods can no longer be allowed to be taken in isolation or out of step \r\nr with the collective needs expressed at the United Nations. \r\nOne of the dramatic achievements of the last two years has been the \r\n#preparations and final decisions of the Rio Summit, particularly the consensus \r\nto establish the commission on sustainable development. Here would lie a \r\noldstrong prospect of an international consensus to address questions on \r\nHi development of the South. The Commission would also provide a needed \r\n](iOpportunity to interface the affairs of Bretton Woods with deliberations at \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n88 \r\n(Mr. Razali. Malaysia) \r\nthe United Nations. The world social summit also promises to further the \r\ninternational consensus for development and the consolidation of States. \r\nMalaysia is encouraged by the Secretary-General\u0027s commitment to enhance the \r\nrenewal of global partnership and development as reflected in his report. We \r\nbelieve that he has a special and catalytic role to play to bring about a \r\nfresh North-South dialogue and cooperation. The Secretary-General has been \r\nwidely acclaimed for his \"Agenda for Peace\". Now we would appeal to him for \r\nan \"agenda for development\" to enhance international development cooperation. \r\nThe report on the organization considered extensively United Nations \r\nactivities in the context of conflict management and humanitarian assistance. \r\nThis part links up to the Secretary-General\u0027s \"Agenda for Peace\". It is a \r\nfact that the United Nations has regained considerable credibility on the \r\nbasis of successful efforts in defusing tensions and conflicts in the last few \r\nyears. The United Nations peace-keeping operations stand out as an \r\noutstanding example of what the United Nations is capable of doing. \r\nIn the \"Agenda for Peace\" the Secretary-General focused on the question \r\nof preventive diplomacy. The successful application of preventive diplomacy \r\nwill make unnecessary extensive peace-keeping bogged down interminably and \r\nplagued by financial constraints. Malaysia is convinced that the future \r\ncredibility and effectiveness of the concept of collective security and the \r\nUnited Nations role in the maintenance of international peace and security \r\nrequire greater use of the mechanism for preventive diplomacy. This will be \r\npossible if there is strong support for the Secretary-General and the Security \r\nCouncil to undertake pro-active actions, early actions to evaluate conflict \r\nsituations and undertake decisive moves to prevent the outbreak of open \r\nconflicts. But Member States will give their support only if there is \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n89 \r\n(Mr. Razali. Malaysia) \r\nsufficient confidence and trust especially in the actions of the Security \r\nCouncil, something which has to be acquired over time. \r\nThe Malaysian delegation also wishes to see that the United Nations, as \r\nan international organization committed to peace and development, have full \r\nrecourse to the collective efforts and resources under the provision of \r\nChapter VI of the Charter on pacific settlement of disputes, raised by the \r\nSecretary-General in paragraph 34 of his report. The pacific settlement of \r\ndisputes, no matter how difficult to achieve, would produce lasting results in \r\nterms of ensuring durable peace and security. Malaysia does not hesitate over \r\nthe use of force as a collective action. We have supported such actions in \r\n1 the past and have insisted that force be applied in the case of Bosnia and \r\n\u0027Herzegovina. \r\nMy delegation fully endorses the Secretary-General\u0027s view that \r\n\"The principles of the Charter must be applied consistently, not \r\nselectively, for if the perception should be of the latter, trust will \r\nwane and with it the moral authority which is the greatest and most \r\ns unique quality of that instrument.\" (A/47/277, para. 82) \r\n:.:• The United Nations effectiveness in preventing and settling conflicts, \r\nilljand preserving international peace is dependent on the credibility of its \r\n{([.decisions and the degree of consistency in the application of the principles \r\n,-flf the Charter. In the spirit of the Charter and the interests of Member \r\nii:.5tates, there has to be harmonization in the relationship between the General \r\n^Assembly and the Security Council on the question of peace and security. We \r\nlljiust not have a situation where the views of the general membership of the \r\nt/nited Nations are ignored and the Council chooses to apply principles only \r\nAen it suits the interests and convenience of certain members. \r\nid\u00271 \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n90 \r\n(Mr. Razali. Malaysia) \r\nWe are not happy over the absence of a balanced, mutually reinforcing \r\nrelationship between tlie Security Council and the General Assembly. There \r\nshould be a greater role for the General Assembly and more regular and closer \r\nconsultations between the general membership and the Security Council in \r\nmatters relating to peace and security. In this regard, the General Assembly \r\nshould assert its role in upholding the Charter and ensure that the expanding \r\nactivities of the Security Council do not go beyond its mandate or run counter \r\nto the provisions of the Charter, particularly Article 2 (7) concerning the \r\ncardinal rule on non-interference in the domestic affairs of Member States. \r\nThe United Nations exists on the basis of sovereign States, clearly embodied \r\nand reflected in the business conducted at the General Assembly. There cannot \r\nbe any attrition of sovereignty, either by actions of the Security Council or \r\neven in peace-keeping and similar actions. While traditional concepts are \r\nundergoing change, given the asymetry of the power equation and an unequal \r\nworld, sovereignty must continue to be upheld. \r\nWe endorse the call by the Secretary-General for closer support between \r\nthe United Nations and the regional organizations. However, this would \r\nrequire further efforts at the regional levels to enable the regional \r\norganizations to play a supportive role to the United Nations in areas of \r\nconfidence-building, peaceful resolutions of conflicts, peacemaking and \r\npeace-keeping. \r\nAbove all, the current situation underlines the need for the reform and \r\nrestructuring of the Security Council so that its membership should be \r\nexpanded to reflect better the general membership of the United Nations, which \r\nhas increased to 179 countries, and so that there is transparency, \r\naccountability and democratization in the work of the Council. The veto power \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n90(a-z) \r\n(Mr. Razali. Malaysia) \r\ngiven to the Permanent Five at the time of the establishment of the United \r\nNations has now become highly suspect. More and more countries, both from the \r\nSouth and North, urged the reform and restructuring of the Council at the \r\ncurrent general debate. Clearly, the time for change is now and the General \r\nAssembly should, before the end of the forty-seventh session, establish a \r\nworking group to undertake a study of the reform and restructuring of the \r\nCouncil and submit its report to the forty-eighth session of the General \r\nAssembly though actual results may have to await more time. In our \r\nestimation, given the increased workload and the expanded role being \r\nvisualized for the Security Council in the Secretary-General\u0027s \"Agenda for \r\nPeace\", we in Malaysia do not believe that the present Security Council as \r\nconstituted and structured can be the viable vehicle for those objectives. \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n91 \r\n(Mr. Razali. Malaysia) \r\nMy delegation notes with interest the Secretary-General\u0027s various \r\nproposals on the question of the financing of the United Nations. Secure \r\nfinancing of the various United Nations peace-keeping operations is the \r\ncollective responsibility of all States, and there must be prompt payments. \r\nThe persistent problem of late payments and the accumulation of large arrears \r\nundermines the United Nations ability to perform its peace-keeping and \r\npeacemaking functions. \r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s report also points out the dramatic increase in \r\nthe workload and activities of the Security Council. While the increased \r\nactivities of the Security Council, on the one hand, underline the importance \r\nof the United Nations role in the maintenance of peace and security, it is \r\nbecoming a serious cause for concern that the end of the cold war and the \r\ncollapse of the communist bloc have unleashed nationalist conflicts and ethnic \r\nstrife that are over-stretching the capacity of the United Nations. The \r\n$2.7 billion cost of current peace-keeping operations is two-and-a-half times \r\nthe budget of the entire Organization. The number of peace-keeping forces in \r\nthe field has almost quadrupled, from 11,500 in January 1992 to 44,000 in \r\nmid-1992. The effect of all this is not only that it has placed a severe \r\nstrain it has brought on the capacities of the Organization, but in particular \r\nthat it is becoming a serious test case of the concept of United Nations \r\ncollective security at a time when so much is expected of the United Nations. \r\nMalaysia is particularly concerned that such a situation could, in the name of \r\nexpedience, encourage selective and double standards in addressing threats to \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\nThe case of Bosnia and Herzegovina is one example of where the financial \r\ncrisis, in a way, has been the reason for inadequate United Nations action and \r\nhas set a bad precedent, in the case of resolution 770 (1992), where only \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n92 \r\n(Mr. Razali. Malaysia) \r\ncountries that can afford to make their own military contributions to the \r\nUnited Nations Protection Force to ensure the safety of humanitarian efforts \r\ncan participate. If this is allowed to continue, the United Nations will in \r\nfact be encouraging peace-keeping operations by the few and moving away from \r\nthe accepted practice of having as broad-based a representation as possible. \r\nThere are several proposals in the Secretary-General\u0027s report on \r\npeace-keeping that were considered in the meeting of the Special Committee on \r\nPeace-keeping Operations earlier this year and incorporated in the conclusion \r\nof that Committee\u0027s report in document A/47/235. The proposals are practical \r\nones, relating to more efficient logistical support for peace-keeping \r\noperations and a more reliable and sustained availability of equipment. There \r\nare also specific proposals on training and the availability of personnel. In \r\nhis report, the Secretary-General proposed the establishment of a \r\npeace-keeping fund as a start-up cost for authorized peace-keeping \r\noperations. Malaysia regards these proposals as practical suggestions to \r\nenhance the United Nations capacity for peace-keeping, and we believe that \r\nthese proposals deserve strong support from Member States. \r\nMalaysia is strongly committed to enhancing the United Nations capacity \r\nfor preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and peacemaking. Our delegation has \r\nbeen involved in the work of like-minded countries belonging to the \r\n\u0027 Non-Aligned Movement in considering the Secretary-General\u0027s report \"An Agenda \r\n\u0027 for Peace\". My country is contributing military and civilian personnel to many \r\n•: of the United Nations peace-keeping operations around the world. Hence, \r\nregard, Malaysia would actively participate in any future follow-up action on \r\nI\u003e the Secretary-General\u0027s report \"An Agenda for Peace\". We believe that \r\nA/47/PV.31 \r\n93 \r\n(Mr. Razali. Malaysia) \r\na working group should be established to identify proposals contained in the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report that command consensus support, so that they could \r\nbe implemented as a matter of some urgency. At the same time, the working \r\ngroup could deliberate further on those ideas that require further study and \r\nwork towards consensus-building, so that the sum total of their work would go \r\ntowards enhancing the United Nations capacity for and use of preventive \r\ndiplomacy, peace-keeping and peacemaking. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m. \r\n"
