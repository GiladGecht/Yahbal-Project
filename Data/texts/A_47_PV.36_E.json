I should like, on behalf of the \r\nGovernment of Mauritius, to congratulate the United Nations for having taken \r\nthe laudable initiative of convening, for the first time in its history, a \r\nseries of special plenary meetings devoted to the issue of the disabled. \r\nThis, in itself, is a clear demonstration of the importance the international \r\ncommunity attaches to an issue that directly concerns some 500 million people \r\naround the world. As we all know, concern for such a large section of the \r\nhuman population began to express itself when the United Nations took the bold \r\ndecision to declare 1981 tie International Year of Disabled Persons and with \r\nthe Organization\u0027s subsequent declaration of the Decade of Disabled Persons \r\nand the elaboration of the World Programme of Action. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n3-5 \r\n(Mr. Offmann. Mauritius) \r\nUnfortunately, in many parts of the developing world, the Programme of \r\nAction and the 10 points contained in the Agenda could not be translated into \r\nreality not necessarily for lack of interest, but rather as a result of the \r\npaucity of resources, deterioration in the general standards of living, \r\nunfavourable terms of trade between the countries of the North and those of \r\nthe South, the extraordinarily low priority given to the issue of disability \r\nby donor agencies and the total indifference to this problem by international \r\nfinancing institutions in their prescription of structural adjustment \r\nprogrammes. \r\nIn Mauritius, however, favourable circumstances have enabled the \r\nGovernment to pay special attention to its disabled citizens and to take a \r\nseries of measures aimed at enhancing the status of people with disabilities. \r\nIn fact, the Decade of Disabled Persons has also been the decade of economic \r\ngrowth in Mauritius, the decade of full employment and of general improvement \r\nin the living conditions of our population. We have seized this opportunity \r\nto include a component addressing disability in most of our development \r\nprogrammes as advocated by the United Nations in its Tallin Guidelines. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n6 \r\n(Mr. Offmann. Mauritius) \r\nHeading our agenda of actions has been the pursuit of relentless efforts \r\nto prevent disability by the practical elimination of killer and crippling \r\ndiseases. In this context, I am proud to say that scourges like \r\npoliomyelitis, leprosy, trachoma and onchocerciasis have been completely \r\neradicated in Mauritius. \r\nFurthermore, to limit the baneful consequences of industrialization and \r\nurbanization, which bring in their wake disabling conditions such as \r\npollution, traffic accidents and accidents in the place of work, legislative \r\nmeasures like the Occupational Safety, Health and Welfare Act (1988) and the \r\nProtection of the Environment Act have been passed to ensure that safety norms \r\nare respected by enterprises, industrial concerns and places of work in \r\ngeneral and also to prevent disability arising out of industrial and \r\nenvironmental pollution. \r\nSide by side with preventive measures, we also took important steps to \r\nimprove the quality of life of our citizens with disabilities by providing a \r\nwide array of social benefits. These range from the payment of a basic \r\ninvalidity pension to all categories of disabled persons and a carer\u0027s \r\nallowance to those who need constant care and attention, to important tax \r\nrebates to persons with disabilities and parents of disabled children. \r\nMoreover, the Government provides free prosthetic and orthotic appliances and \r\nassistive devices such as wheelchairs, audio-prostheses, low-vision aids and \r\nwalking aids are made available free of charge to disabled persons. Also, as \r\nMauritius is a party to the Florence Agreement and Nairobi Protocol, no duties \r\nare levied on materials for blind persons, or on sports and educational \r\nequipment for persons with disabilities and assistive devices. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n7 \r\n(Mr. Offmann. Mauritius) \r\nIn addition, our policy is geared towards upholding the dignity of the \r\ndisabled person. In this context, and in consonance with ILO Convention 159, \r\nimportant legislative actions have been taken to provide vocational training \r\nand promote employment opportunities for our disabled citizens. \r\nTwo historic pieces of legislation the Trust Fund for Disabled Persons \r\nAct and the Employment of Disabled Persons Act were passed in November 1988. \r\nThe aim was to drive home the fact that citizens with disabilities are \r\nentitled to training and employment as a matter of right and not as an act of \r\ncharity. It is worth notiug that in the provision of vocational training we \r\nhave adopted an innovative approach by making use of existing training \r\ninstitutions catering for the general population rather than creating new \r\nfacilities specifically for disabled persons. This approach is not only \r\ncost-effective but also helps to promote the concept of integration. \r\nFurthermore, with the Employment of Disabled Persons Act, a measure of \r\npositive discrimination has been introduced and this has succeeded in \r\nensuring employment opportunities for persons with disabilities in open \r\nenterprises both as white-collar and blue-collar workers. \r\nTo further promote the concept of integration, we decided to include a \r\ncomponent of disability in all of our major programmes. Nothing illustrates \r\nthis holistic approach more clearly than the blueprint prepared by the \r\nGovernment on the revamping of the general system of education. A master plan \r\non education has been produced which contains an important chapter on the \r\neducation of persons with disabilities and the training of regular school \r\nteachers in the education of disabled children. \r\nIn the same way, statistics on disabled persons have been collected by \r\nmodifying the Statistics Act to make provision for the collection of data on \r\ndisability. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n8 \r\n(Mr. Offmann. Mauritius) \r\nAs one of the strengths of the Mauritian society is that of the strong \r\nbonds that unite family members, we have provided a package of incentives that \r\nhave induced family members to look after severely handicapped persons, whose \r\nnumber is increasing owing to the ageing of the population and the greater \r\nsurvival of children. \r\nFinally, as the World Programme of Action lays strong emphasis on the \r\nremoval of the numerous architectural, transportation and communication \r\nbarriers which constitute a denial of the basic rights of the individual, we \r\nare planning a series of measures to empower disabled persons and to enable \r\ntheir unrestricted participation in society. Large print, audiotape and \r\nbraille are already commonly available for blind people and captions are \r\nregularly used on the national television for the benefit of hearing-impaired \r\npersons. \r\nThe Decade of Disabled Persons has provided an opportunity for \r\nreflection, for awareness-raising, for concerted action, for mobilization of \r\nresources and for stocktaking. The Decade has now come to an end. Many of \r\nthe problems affecting disabled persons are still with us. New problems have \r\ncome to add to the existing ones. New challenges are facing the world today \r\nand new issues are beckoning the international community for the years to \r\ncome. I would like to cite a few of these challenges: \r\nFirst, the increasing proportion of elderly persons within the \r\npopulation. With the dramatic increase in life expectancy, more and more \r\npeople are joining the ranks of the senior citizens. The longer they live, \r\nthe greater the possibility of having one type of disability or another. I\"1 \r\nfact, according to research on the phenomenon of gerontology, many elderly \r\npersons will live with Alzheimer\u0027s disease and the other complications from \r\nthis will put a great strain on the social security systems and welfare \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n9-10 \r\n(Mr. Offmann. Mauritius) \r\nservices of many countries including Mauritius, which is witnessing a rapid \r\nageing of the population. \r\nSecondly, the growth of invisible disabilities. Cardiovascular and \r\ncerebrovascular illnesses are becoming widespread owing to the change in \r\nlifestyle, unbearable pressure at work, stress at home, the hectic pace of \r\nlife, bad food consumption habits and so on. Every year, an increasing number \r\nof people are falling victim to myocardial infarctions; many of them manage to \r\nsurvive and spend the rest of their lives with a disability. \r\n\" Thirdly, the growing number of citizens with intellectual disabilities \r\n5 and mental illnesses. This is one of the surprises of the surveys on \r\n• disability conducted in a number of countries. We are witnessing a rise in \r\n;,; the proportion of persons with mental disabilities. Their rehabilitation \r\nposes an important challenge. They need to be integrated into the community \r\nwithout being deprived of their basic rights as citizens. \r\n•\u0027••- Fourthly, desertification and environmental degradation, especially in \r\n\u0027Africa, which are leading to drought and widespread famine, the result of \r\nisSwhich is, obviously, an increase in the number of children and adults with \r\n/different types of disabilities, resulting from malnutrition and dearth of \r\npis\u0027 food. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n11 \r\n(Mr. Offmann. Maurifri.,?) \r\nFifthly, the scourge of AIDS, which is ravaging many countries, is the \r\nbiggest challenge to the world today. Many of those who contract the disease, \r\nonce their condition is known, become pariahs and are stripped of their \r\nsociological roles and become both physically and socially disabled. \r\nSixthly, the last point to which I should like to draw attention, is the \r\nquestion of ethics. With the spectacular advances in medical technology and \r\ngenetic engineering, it is now possible to know whether a child will be born \r\nwith a disability or not. The questions with which we shall be confronted \r\nmore often are: should there be selective non-treatment? Should death be \r\nconsidered as a management option for them? Should life-saving surgical \r\noperations be refused those suspected of having a medical disorder? All this \r\nposes an ethical problem, as it touches the sacrosanctity of life. \r\nTo conclude, I should like to make an appeal to the international \r\ncommunity that after the end of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons, \r\nthe issue of disability not be relegated to limbo. A new plan of action \r\nshould be developed to meet the new challenges facing the world in the years \r\nto come. \r\nMr. FLOOD (Ireland): I am honoured to speak at this, the \r\nforty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, which \r\nmarks the end of the first decade of the World Programme of Action concerning \r\nDisabled Persons and, at the same time, seeks to define a new strategy which \r\nwill bring us into the next century. It is indeed fitting that we should meet \r\nto review progress over the past 10 years and to renew our ambitions to \r\nprovide for all people with disabilities the same rights and opportunities \r\nthat are available to the rest of society. I have noted with interest how the \r\noverall situation in relation to people with disabilities varies from country \r\nto country, and how the priorities for future initiatives differ. However, I \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n12 \r\n(Mr. Flood. Ireland) \r\nthink that what has most impressed me is the clear determination of all \r\nmembers to improve the conditions and services for people with disabilities \r\nand the mutual eagerness to learn and benefit from each other\u0027s experiences. \r\nI should like to give some details in the time available to me of the \r\npolicy initiatives that have been undertaken in Ireland in the past decade and \r\nindicate generally how we see our services and conditions generally developing \r\nfor people with disabilities. \r\nIn Ireland our services for people with disabilities have witnessed quite \r\nradical change in emphasis in the last decade. There is now a general policy \r\nof caring for disabled and elderly people in community-based facilities and \r\ndeveloping appropriate support services to enable them to participate to the \r\nfullest extent possible in all the activities of community life. This is in \r\nmarked contrast to the traditional approach of providing institutional-type \r\ncare, which, though well motivated at the time, had the effect of setting the \r\nhandicapped apart from society. Our general policy approach now is to \r\nintegrate them into society to the fullest extent possible, and we see this as \r\na necessary first step in ensuring equal rights and opportunities for all \r\npeople with disabilities. Of course, we do accept that some people may not be \r\nable to cope in a community setting, and adequate facilities of a more formal \r\nnature are required to meet their needs. \r\nThese changes were stimulated by the publication of a number of \r\nGovernment policy reports on the development of the services. The first of \r\nthese was a Government Green Paper on Services for Disabled People entitled \r\n\"Towards a Full Life\", which was published in 1984. It outlined Government \r\npolicy in relation to the development of services for people with a disability \r\ngenerally. Since then there has been a separate review of the psychiatric \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n13 \r\n(Mr. Flood. Tr?i?^) \r\nservices in a report entitled \"Planning for the Future\", and, in the past two \r\nyears, a report of a Review Group on Mental Handicap Services entitled \"Needs \r\nand Abilities\" was published. These two reports will form the basis for the \r\ndevelopment of services in these areas over the next decade. \r\nMy department has just recently established a Review Group on Services \r\nfor People with Physical and Sensory disabilities. The terms of reference of \r\nthis group are: \r\n\"to examine the current provision of health-care services to people with \r\nphysical or sensory disabilities and to consider how they should be \r\ndeveloped to meet more effectively their needs ...\" \r\nI look forward to a comprehensive report which will provide a blueprint for \r\nthe development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities \r\nfor the next decade, and indeed beyond. \r\nWhen this review is completed we will have in Ireland, as members can \r\nsee, a full range of policy documents in relation to health services for \r\npeople with disabilities, and I am confident that the priorities and \r\naspirations set out in these documents will provide a sound framework for \r\naction and result in a level of service of the very highest quality for people \r\nwith disabilities. \r\nIn the development of services and policies, our first priority must be \r\nto listen to, and take full account of, what disabled people themselves tell \r\nus they need not what we, the able-bodied, perceive to be their needs. I am \r\ndelighted therefore to see especially so many disabled people among us. In \r\nIreland we have a well-established system of consultation with organizations \r\nrepresenting disabled people, and their contribution to the development of \r\npolicy and services has been enormous. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n14 \r\n(Mr. Flood. Ireland) \r\nThe community care approach requires a supportive network of \r\ncommunity-based services. Last year the Government concluded an agreement \r\nwith the social partners, including the employers and trade unions, called a \r\nProgramme for Economic and Social Progress. This programme provides that \r\nadditional resources will be made available to facilitate an appropriate mix \r\nof community and residential services for people with disabilities. The \r\ndevelopment of community-based services will be facilitated by the provision \r\nof additional paramedical services, such as physiotherapy, speech and \r\noccupational therapy, supported by vocational rehabilitation services, \r\nadditional day-care centres, respite-care facilities and home-support \r\nservices. Already significant additional resources have been provided under \r\nthe programme for services for people with disabilities. \r\nOf course, not all progress is dependent on increased levels of \r\ninvestment in new and expanded services. Much can be achieved by fostering in \r\nlocal communities, and indeed in the community at large, an acceptance of \r\npeople with disabilities and of their right to as normal a life as possible \r\nwithin the community. This is particularly true of persons who have a mental \r\nhandicap or a history of psychiatric illness. I am happy to say that in \r\nIreland it is accepted practice that as far as possible such people are now \r\nmaintained in local communities, and the old stigmas or taboos which were very \r\ngeneral in our society are fast fading away. This I regard as a most \r\nnecessary development and indeed a prerequisite for the general improvement of \r\nthe environment for people with disabilities of whatever type or origin. \r\nThe achievement of social integration of people with disabilities is of \r\nuecessity a two-way process. It requires a willingness on the part of people \r\n\"ith disabilities to reach out into the community; equally it demands that the \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n15 \r\n(Mr. Flood. Tr?7nnrl) \r\npublic is aware of the problems faced by people with disabilities and is \r\nencouraged to play its part in reaching an acceptable solution. \r\nThe attitudes of society can be manifested, in a visible sense, in the \r\nprovision of support or facilities for the handicapped. However, attitudes \r\nare also manifest in the less obvious sense in the way we deal with the \r\nhandicapped socially and to the extent that we may reveal prejudices or an \r\nimplicit lack of understanding. There is a need therefore to pay considerably \r\nmore attention to the removal of social barriers and the elimination of \r\nprejudice and negative attitudes. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n16 \r\n(Mr. Flood. Ireland) \r\nPublic achievements by people with disabilities are one way of breaking \r\ndown the barriers. Irish people with disabilities have achieved international \r\nrecognition in the field of art and literature. For example, the work of \r\nChristy Browne and Christopher Nolan has helped to provide enormous \r\nencouragement to other artists with disabilities. The film \"My Left Foot\" has \r\nachieved international acclaim and is a testimony to the work of \r\nChristy Browne. But perhaps more importantly, it has been a source of \r\ninspiration to others - able-bodied and disabled alike. \r\nThe last few years have witnessed, internationally, a growing realisation \r\nof the right of people with disabilities to fully share in and contribute to \r\nthe economic, social, political and cultural activities of society. In \r\nIreland it is no different. The Programme for Economic and Social Progress \r\nprovides that the Government, in consultation with the organizations \r\nrepresenting people with disabilities, will examine how best the rights of \r\ndisabled people can be promoted. Consultations on this issue with disabled \r\npeople\u0027s organizations has already commenced, and in the light of responses we \r\nshall be examining how best progress on this matter can be made. \r\nOne of the primary objectives of policies and programmes for people with \r\ndisabilities is to ensure that they are provided with appropriate training to \r\nenable them to develop the necessary skills to play a full role in society. \r\nIn Ireland there is a wide network of vocational-training centres, provided \r\nboth by statutory and by voluntary organizations, which cater for \r\napproximately 7,000 disabled persons. This network is financed by a \r\ncombination of State funding and aid from the European Social Fund. \r\nThe National Rehabilitation Board is a statutory body that provides \r\nspecialized vocational assessment, counselling and a placement service for \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n17 \r\n(Mr. Flood. Ireland) \r\npeople with disabilities, .including school-leavers. This vocational service \r\nassesses the disabled person, gives guidance and counsel on the most \r\nappropriate form of training or career choice, arranges training or further \r\neducation and, where possible, secures suitable employment. During the early \r\nyears at work a follow-up service is provided to assist with any problems. \r\nThe vocational service works closely with health boards and with various \r\nvoluntary and statutory training agencies, trade unions and employers to \r\nensure that people with disabilities secure a fair share of the available \r\nemployment. \r\nTraining is, of course, only one side of the coin. Employment is the key \r\nfactor in ensuring that disabled people take their rightful place as full and \r\nequal members of society. For almost everybody work is a basic human desire, \r\nbut for a disabled person work carries the additional advantage of enabling \r\nhim to cast off the role of dependant that has traditionally been associated \r\nwith disability and to become fully independent. The advantages of a working \r\nlife go beyond its financial rewards. Work confers social status. It brings \r\nwith it an opportunity for self-expression and the satisfaction of making a \r\ncontribution to the economic life of the local community and, indeed, to the \r\nnation as a whole. \r\nSecuring work for our disabled remains a big challenge, not just in \r\nIreland but throughout the world. This, however, requires the combined \r\nefforts of a range of interests, including Governments, employers, employees \r\nand trade unions, as well as the many organizations catering for people with \r\ndisabilities. \r\nIn Ireland the Government is concerned to ensure that an \r\nalready-disadvantaged group, such as people with disabilities, does not have \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n18 \r\n(Mr. Flood. Ireland) \r\nto bear an excessive share of the brunt of unemployment, and it has taken a \r\nnumber of steps to improve employment opportunities. The Government has \r\nrecently introduced a number of measures to improve employment opportunities \r\nfor the people with disabilities. These include a target of doubling the \r\nnumbers of handicapped persons placed annually under the Employment Incentive \r\nScheme. \r\nAn Employment Support Scheme was recently introduced for the purpose of \r\nproviding work opportunities for people with more severe handicaps, who can \r\noften be neglected when it comes to employment considerations. This scheme \r\noperates by providing subsidies to employers, having regard to the \r\nproductivity of the disabled worker. There was also a significant increase in \r\nthe fund for workplace aids and adaptations. \r\nA Government Committee has recently been established to monitor the \r\ncommitment given in the Programme for Economic and Social Progress to increase \r\nthe numbers of disabled people employed under the public-sector quota scheme. \r\nIf persons with disabilities are to be supported in the community it is \r\nnecessary that they have an adequate level of income by which to support \r\nthemselves. In Ireland there are a number of income-maintenance schemes \r\ndesigned to assist the people with disabilities. The main income-maintenance \r\nscheme is the disabled persons maintenance allowance, which is payable subject \r\nto both medical and means tests. \r\nThere are also a number of social-insurance-based schemes, such as \r\ninvalidity pension, disablement benefit and disability benefit. Persons in \r\nreceipt of disabled persons maintenance allowance and invalidity pension \r\nqualify also, in certain circumstances, for a range of other benefits, such as \r\nfree travel, free-electricity allowance, free telephone rental, free \r\ntelevision licence and free fuel. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n19 \r\n(Mr. Flood, Ireland) \r\nIn addition, there are financial-support schemes for the blind and for \r\nparents of handicapped children. A mobility allowance and motorized-transport \r\ngrant may also be paid in certain situations. There is also a variety of \r\ntax-relief schemes for the handicapped, which provide for rebates of tax and \r\nexcise duty paid on petrol and cars. \r\nThe special needs of physically handicapped people in their domestic \r\nenvironment are provided for by a grant scheme that allows for adaptations to \r\ntheir homes to facilitate greater independence. This scheme provides for \r\nsignificant structural alterations and extensions where necessary. \r\nIn addition to the grant schemes, loan assistance is provided by \r\nvoluntary organizations towards meeting the cost of housing developments for \r\nhandicapped persons. This scheme, which has facilitated the provision of \r\nindependent-living facilities, provides a grant of up to 90 per cent of the \r\ncost of these developments. \r\nOf course, services for people with disabilities involve a number of \r\nGovernment departments and agencies. I should like to refer to the \r\nsignificant developments that have taken place in the past decade in areas \r\nthat do not come within my sphere of responsibility as Minister of State at \r\nthe Department of Health. \r\nThe Department of Education provides a comprehensive range of specialized \r\neducation services for the disabled. These services are tailored to the needs \r\nof children suffering from disabilities mild or severe - relating to \r\nphysical, mental, sensory or emotional performance. \r\nSpecial schools are dedicated to the needs of particular clinical groups, \r\nand special classes cater for disabled pupils in the ordinary school setting \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n20 \r\n(Mr. Flood. Ireland) \r\nwhere the degree of disability is such as to allow limited integration to take \r\nplace. In addition to enjoying reduced pupil-teacher ratios, these special \r\nservices attract increased levels of capitation grant and have access to extra \r\nfunding for the purchase of specialized equipment and materials. One of the \r\nprimary objectives of policies and programmes for people with disabilities is \r\nto equip them to make a practical contribution to society to the maximum \r\nextent permitted by their disabilities. \r\nThe foregoing services are further supplemented by a special \r\nvisiting-teacher service, which provides back-up to children suffering from \r\nvisual or hearing impairment. In addition, a home-tuition service is provided \r\nfor children who, because of their disability, are unable to attend school on \r\na regular basis. \r\nIt is Department of Education policy to encourage the integration of \r\ndisabled children into ordinary schools wherever possible, and increasingly \r\nparents are opting for this approach. As a consequence, it is necessary to \r\nconsider a redirection of resources in support of this trend. \r\nAlready additional resources provided under the Programme for Economic \r\nand Social Progress have facilitated an improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio \r\nin special schools, an expansion of the visiting-teacher service to embrace \r\nadditional clinical groups and the deployment of resource teachers to assist \r\ndisabled pupils in an integrated setting. \r\nHowever, there is a need for a fundamental examination of the range and \r\nlevel of educational and other support services necessary in order to maximize \r\nthe potential of disabled children. A Special Committee, representative of \r\nexperts in the field of special education, established by my colleague the \r\nMinister for Education to make recommendations in this regard, is expected to \r\nreport shortly. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n20(a-z) \r\n(Mr. Flood. Ireland) \r\nNew building regulations containing stringent new requirements on access \r\nfor disabled people were introduced last year. The new regulations include \r\nrequirements that apply to common areas in apartment blocks and to all new \r\nbuildings and extensions to existing buildings and provide that: at least one \r\nentrance intended for general use, preferably the main entrance, will be \r\naccessible to wheelchair users; the internal layout will enable disabled \r\npeople to circulate, with full access to all parts of the building; there will \r\nbe passenger lifts with suitable access for the disabled; one bedroom in 20 in \r\neach hotel and guest-house will be suitable for a wheelchair user; there will \r\nbe one unisex toilet for wheelchair users in a convenient and accessible part \r\nof the building; there will be a minimum number of reserved seats in theatres, \r\ncinemas, concert halls and sports stadiums; there will be technical aids to \r\ncommunication in buildings used for entertainment, conferences or religion. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n21 \r\n(Mr. Flood. Ireland) \r\nIt is Government policy that transport providers must, on an ongoing \r\nbasis, give attention to improving acessibility to transport for people with \r\ndisabilities. There is a Government Transport Accessibility Committee that \r\nmonitors provision and urges transport providers, who are represented on the \r\nCommittee, to improve facilities. \r\nThere have been notable improvements in accessibility to public transport \r\nin recent years. The Committee has drawn up a three-year programme of action \r\nfurther to improve facilities. Proposals that are currently being pursued \r\ninclude the introduction of a pilot fixed-route wheelchair-accessible bus \r\nservice in Dublin City and the introduction of wheelchair-accessible taxis. \r\nThe existing arrangements for persons with mobility handicaps who use \r\nairports, air services, ports and sea transport is also being examined with a \r\nview to improving such arrangements. \r\nFrom what I have said, it will be evident that we have spent a \r\nconsiderable amount of time and effort in Ireland over this past decade in \r\nclarifying our objectives in relation to the handicapped, in thinking out in a \r\nsystematic manner how the very considerable problems faced by people with \r\ndisabilities should be addressed and in putting in place what we regard as a \r\nsound platform on which to build for the future. The challenge, of course, \r\nthat now faces us is in translating this basic framework into real and \r\nmeaningful benefits for people with disabilities in their daily lives and in \r\nensuring that the necessary supports are in place to ensure that every person \r\nwith a handicap can have a full and satisfying place as an equal member of \r\nsociety. \r\nEconomically, the 1980s have been a difficult time in Ireland. We were \r\nfaced with a difficult budgetary situation, which had to be corrected, we had \r\nto cope with a growing unemployment problem and we had to be prudent in our \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n22 \r\n(Mr. Flood. Ireland) \r\napproach to ensure that the fundamentals of our economy were put on a sound \r\nfooting so that we could participate fully in the movement towards the \r\nexpansion and closer integration of the European Community. I am happy to say \r\nthat we have made considerable progress in this regard. \r\nAll of this has meant, however, that we have not been able to increase \r\nour investment in services such as these for people with disabilities as \r\nquickly as we would otherwise have wished. It would seem to me from the \r\ncontributions that I have heard so far that we in Ireland are not alone in \r\nthis. Nevertheless, as I have outlined, progress had been made, and I would \r\nbe fairly confident that we can now move forward with some certainty to reap \r\nthe benefits of the careful groundwork that we have laid. \r\nI was pleased to be able to attend the Council of Europe\u0027s first \r\nministerial conference on disability, held in Paris last November, which gave \r\nrenewed European impetus in this area. \r\nI repeat that I am very happy indeed, privileged to be here in New \r\nYork today to lend my voice and that of the Irish Government towards securing \r\nfull civil rights in all walks of life for all persons, of every creed, colour \r\nand nationality, with a handicap. I accept that it is the responsibility of \r\neach of us in our countries to ensure that our own citizens with disabilities \r\nare provided every facility in order to assume their rightful place in \r\nsociety, but international bodies such as the United Nations and the Council \r\nof Europe can be powerful forces for change in this regard. \r\nFinally,, I congratulate the United Nations on its initiative. I am \r\nconfident that our deliberations and resolutions here for these two days will \r\nreverberate around the globe and, hopefully, mark a giant step forward for our \r\ndisabled brothers and sisters throughout the world towards achieving their \r\nrightful place in society. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n23 \r\nMr, KALLEHAUGE (Denmark): I am truly honoured to address the \r\nAssembly today on behalf o:; the Danish Government at this plenary meeting of \r\nthe forty-seventh session, which marks the conclusion of the United Nations \r\nDecade of Disabled Persons and the tenth anniversary of the World Programme of \r\nAction. \r\nIn the speech that I delivered in the Third Committee last year, I \r\nmentioned that in 1980 and since 1988 the Danish Government had included a \r\nrepresentative of the organizations of persons with disabilities as a member \r\nof the Danish delegation. At the same time, Denmark urged other Member States \r\nto act in a similar way. It is a great pleasure to note that a still \r\nincreasing number of Member States is following the good examples earlier set \r\nby, among others, Norway, Austria, Canada, Australia and Denmark. This policy \r\ndemonstrates how disabled persons have become much more visible during the \r\nDecade, and at the same time it gives the disabled the unique chance to speak \r\nfor themselves in the United Nations. \r\nI still remember how strange it seemed to almost everybody I met in the \r\nUnited Nations in 1980 when I spoke in the Third Committee for the first time \r\nabout the preparations for the International Year of Disabled Persons. The \r\ntremendous effect of the awareness campaigns throughout the world during the \r\nDecade is perhaps nowhere better illustrated than by the active participation \r\nof persons with disabilities that we all witness in the General Assembly today. \r\nIn politics, as well as in other human matters, no change will take place \r\nunless the attitudes of the persons involved are changed. So, even if some of \r\nus might think that 10 years is a long time to wait for people so \r\nunderprivileged and marginalized as most persons with disabilities still are, \r\nin particular in the developing countries, the awareness campaigns during the \r\nDecade have been good and necessary investments. But now the time has come \r\nfor the good attitudes and better understanding of our problems to bear fruit. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n24-25 \r\n(Mr. Kallehauoe. Denmark) \r\nThe demand for equality made by the disability movement is based on the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. Human rights are universal, and thus \r\ninclude persons with disabilities unrestrictedly, because people are born free \r\nand equal, and have the same inalienable rights to life and welfare, education \r\nand work, independent living and access to active participation in all aspects \r\nof society. \r\nAny direct discrimination or other negative discriminatory treatment of \r\ndisabled persons is a violation of human rights. Anyone who discriminates on \r\nthe basis of disability or in other ways treats disabled persons differently \r\nthan others bears the burden of proving that such treatment is objectively \r\nwell-founded and not in contravention of the words and meaning of this \r\nprinciple. \r\nPersons with disabilities must be guaranteed equal opportunities. \r\nPersons with disabilities have a right to compensation for their impairment. \r\nAll socially generated barriers physical, as well as financial, social and \r\npsychological - excluding persons with disabilities from full participation in \r\nsociety must be eliminated. The place of disabled persons is everywhere. \r\nThis philosophy leads to the following three basic principles, on which \r\nthe disability movement is founded: persons with disabilities are born free \r\nand equal in dignity and rights; persons with disabilities have the right to \r\nlife, liberty and personal security, like all other human beings; and persons \r\nwith disabilities are entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in all \r\nUnited Nations declarations and other international human rights instruments, \r\nlike their fellow men and women. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n26 \r\n(Mr. Kallehauoe. Denmark) \r\nWe are convinced that these principles are right and that they will also \r\nbe universally accepted because of their ethical value. But even if nobody \r\nwill dispute their validity and truth, it does not mean that these principles \r\nare generally respected. Unfortunately they are not far from it. \r\nTherefore we have to elaborate strategies for how to transform our good \r\nintentions into a practical day-to-day policy, leading step by step to a \r\nsociety for all. \r\nThe integration of disabled persons is both an objective and an \r\ninstrument in the integration process. Disabled people remain invisible as \r\nlong as they do not live integrated, and they cannot become integratd until \r\nthey are visible. That is a paradox which is not uncharacteristic of many of \r\nthe problems which we have to overcome as disabled persons. In the \r\nhandicapped movement we are much too familiar with \"catch 22\", as Josef Heller \r\ncalled it in his novel bearing that title. \r\nIn the years to come, I see two main areas that will be of special \r\nimportance when it comes to identifying the proper strategies for the future. \r\nOne is the ongoing work in the ad hoc Open-ended Working Group established by \r\nthe Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) to elaborate standard rules on the \r\nequalization of opportunities for disabled persons. The latest report on the \r\nmeetings held in Vienna in May 1992 shows good progress and also very \r\npromising results. The implementation and monitoring of the standard rules on \r\nthe equalization of opportunities for disabled persons will, when they are \r\nadopted by ECOSOC next year, become one of the two main tasks in the coming \r\nyears. \r\nThe other area is the increasing awareness of the human-rights aspect in \r\nthe global work carried out for their members by organizations of persons with \r\ndisabilities. In both these areas the United Nations and its specialized \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n27 \r\n(Mr. Kallehauoe. ne\"\"rrjr) \r\nagencies have a very important role to play as the global protector of the \r\ngrossly disadvantaged minority of mankind still formed by persons with \r\ndisabilities. \r\nThis does not mean that the main responsibility for the welfare of the \r\ncitizen does not remain with the Governments of the Member States. But even \r\nin a democracy a minority might need the moral support that the international \r\ncommunity can offer simply by focusing on the human rights and social needs of \r\nthe minority. It is the natural obligation of the United Nations to care \r\nabout and, if necessary, to act on behalf of the minorities. \r\nThe World Conference on Human Rights scheduled to take place in June next \r\nyear provides an excellent opportunity to review progress made in the field of \r\nhuman rights also in relation to persons with disabilities. \r\nThe conscience of international society has often been represented by the \r\nUnited Nations. We trust that the United Nations will continue to be worthy \r\nof our confidence by acting as the international agent and caretaker of the \r\ninterests of persons with disabilities in close cooperation with organizations \r\nof disabled people. \r\nDenmark recommends that access for disabled people to the labour market \r\nbe made the key issue in the coming decade. This recommendation is \r\nwholeheartedly supported by the Danish organizations of persons with \r\ndisabilities. The reason for this proposal is that the integration of persons \r\nwith disabilities on the labour market is achieved nowhere not in the \r\nindustrialized nor in the developing world. Integration on the labour market v \r\ncannot be achieved without integrating disabled people also in the education 1 \r\nsystem and in most other sectors of society, especially those concerning • \r\n* i \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n28 \r\n(Mr. Kallehauoe, Denmark) \r\nhousing, transport and communication. In a paradoxical way, access to the \r\nlabour market might in different societies become the first or the final step \r\nin the integration process. Access to the labour market is of crucial \r\nimportance to persons with disabilities all over the world. \r\nIn the developing countries, where social pensions are scarce or \r\nnon-existent, one cannot survive without a job. If a disabled person cannot \r\n: \r\nearn an income on which she or he can exist, there is no other solution than \r\ni \r\nthe degrading role of begging. In countries with better social pensions, it \r\nis fortunately not a question of life and death if a disabled person gets a \r\njob or not, but a question of normalization. Living a mainstream life means, \r\nr. \r\namong other things, that you earn your own living. \r\nConsequently the equalization of opportunities implies that access to the \r\na \r\nlabour market should be made possible for all persons with disabilities. To \r\nill \r\nhave a job like everybody else is good for a disabled person\u0027s self-respect as \r\nHi: \r\nwell as for the image of persons with disabilities among the population at \r\nif \r\nlarge. Until very sophisticated social programmes are developed, independent \r\nliving for disabled persons will presuppose personal wages stemming from the \r\nlabour market. \r\niii \r\nNo disability issue other than employment is of such importance for \r\niii \r\npersons with disabilities on a global scale that it deserves to be made the \r\nti*\u0027« \r\nfocal-point of all integration efforts in the coming years. It is a good and \r\ni t * \u0027 \r\nvery concrete objective. It does not demand any further explication. \r\ni 111* \r\nEverybody will immediately understand its importance. Instruments that will \r\nt»* \r\nprove to be useful might vary from one country to another, and nobody yet \r\n\"\u0027 knows the answer as to how it can be done most efficiently. It would, \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n29-30 \r\n(Mr. Kallehauoe. Denmark) \r\nhowever, be a worthy competition between the Member States to report to the \r\nUnited Nations in the coming years as to how progress is gained in this \r\nimportant field of the disability work lying ahead of us. \r\nIn conclusion, I wish to express the continued need for improving the \r\ncoordination of the United Nations efforts in favour of the disabled. In his \r\nnext report to the Third Committee, the Secretary-General has been asked to \r\nreport on United Nations co-ordination. In the opinion of the Danish \r\nGovernment, it will be preferable to entrust one agency with the task of \r\ncoordination, in particular regarding the efforts in developing countries. In \r\nour view, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is the agency of the \r\nUnited Nations systme that is best suited to undertake this task. \r\nMr. MOULTRIE (Bahamas): Commemorations are generally a time for \r\nreflection and stocktaking. As we analyse the advances made during the \r\nUnited Nations Decade of Disabled Persons and evaluate their impact on the \r\nlives of the disabled worldwide, we can be satisfied that some progress has \r\nbeen made in meeting our common goals and objectives set out in the World Plan \r\nof Action concerning Disabled Persons. The specific emphasis that the \r\nProgramme of Action placed on the prevention of disability, on rehabilitation \r\nand equalization of opportunity has fostered our better recognition, \r\nperception and understanding of disability. Whether a consequence of injury \r\nresulting from accidents, birth defects, disease, conflict or war, there has \r\nbeen a shift away from viewing disability as inability, and the disabled as a \r\nliability, towards accepting their right to care, and their importance in the \r\npool of human resources essential to the development process. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n31 \r\n(Mr. Moultrie. Bahamas) \r\nConsequently, in many countries, including the Bahamas, persons with \r\ndisabilities have been enabled to define their own interests in their own \r\nterms, whether these relate to self-directed assistance, maintaining their \r\nindependence, improving their quality of life or obtaining accessible housing \r\nand other facilities for the enhancement of full community adjustment and \r\nparticipation. The focus of national, regional and international activities \r\nhas rightly been on devising more precise, more effective and more innovative \r\napproaches to disability, to ensure that these goals and objectives can be \r\nachieved. There can be no question, then, that the Decade and the Programme \r\nof Action have brought both practical and material benefit to the disabled, \r\nand opened to them new opportunities for a better life. \r\nIt is evident, none the less, that further and continuing efforts are \r\nrequired for the Decade\u0027s objectives to be fully realized. Our efforts to \r\nimplement the World Programme of Action and to meet the Decade\u0027s objectives \r\nwere pursued in a less than favourable environment. In developing countries \r\nin particular, staggering economic and social problems have affected the \r\nability of Governments to implement the World Programme of Action. The \r\ntraditional function of the family as care-giver and support system for the \r\ndisabled is being steadily eroded. Developing the accessible range of \r\nservices, training the professionals and providing the technical aids to meet \r\nthe varying needs of the disabled over time is weighing heavily on Governments \r\nencumbered by debt, structural adjustment and other critical socio-economic \r\nproblems. Lacking the resources to underwrite these costs. Governments in \r\ndeveloping countries face formidable problems in formulating and implementing \r\nviable and effective disability policies and programmes. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n32 \r\n(Mr. Moultrie. Bahamas) \r\nResponding effectively to the demands of the disabled and other \r\nvulnerable groups, therefore, remains a considerable challenge. Fortunately, \r\nGovernments have the support and partnership not only of the disabled \r\nthemselves but of a wide range of non-governmental and private voluntary \r\norganizations in formulating and implementing policies and programmes in the \r\narea of disability, from which both the disabled and society benefit. The \r\nvalue of the commendable services these organizations undertake on behalf of \r\nthe disabled must be recognized. \r\nThe years of the Decade have also been turbulent ones, characterized by \r\nconflict within and between States, poverty, famine, drought and disease. The \r\ncasualties of conflicts and the victims of preventable diseases continue to \r\nswell the ranks of the disabled. In these circumstances, efforts by the \r\nUnited Nations and the Secretary-General to build peace, stability and \r\nsecurity, and particularly to address the economic and social roots of \r\npotential conflict, are relevant to the issue of disability. This is yet \r\nanother reason for the Bahamas\u0027 support of initiatives in the areas of peace \r\nand security and social development. We also support the efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations Children\u0027s Fund (UNICEF) and other agencies in the areas of \r\nprevention of disability, including immunization, genetic counselling, drug \r\nand substance abuse treatment and rehabilitation, prenatal and post-natal \r\ncare, sanitation, and maternal and child health. \r\nThe Bahamas does not, however, consider that there is any obstacle to the \r\nimplementation of the World Programme of Action that cannot be overcome with \r\nthe requisite political commitment and through international cooperation. We \r\nhave ourselves continued our dedicated pursuit of the objectives of the World \r\nProgramme of Action with a Decade-end \"Study of the Needs of the Handicapped \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n33 \r\n(Mr. Moultrie. Bahamas) \r\nin the Bahama Islands\", which was conducted in cooperation with a number of \r\nrelevant non-governmental organizations, including the Salvation Army and Life \r\nServices for the Handicapped, a United States based non-governmental \r\norganization. The Desk for the Disabled, the lead Governmental Coordinating \r\nAgency, the Advisory Council on Disability and the Bahamas Council for the \r\nHandicapped, the umbrella organization serving disabled persons and \r\norganizations of disabled persons in the Bahamas, all provided invaluable \r\ninput for the study. \r\nThe study will bring into clearer focus the unmet needs and gaps in \r\nservices to the disabled, explore the role of the family as care-giver and \r\nways and means of strengthening that role, determine how technological aids \r\ncan be more quickly and inexpensively made available to the disabled, and \r\ndevise modalities for statistics-gathering and improve the training of \r\nrehabilitation workers. The data produced is to assist our goal-setting in \r\nthe field of disability, goals we see as not only directed at diminishing \r\nimpairments, but capitalizing on remaining abilities goals that are not \r\nsimply employment-oriented, but that are intended to elicit optimal levels of \r\nfunctional capability from our disabled citizens, while at the same time \r\ngiving due attention to those with irrevocable impairments. \r\nThe Bahamas is ready, therefore, to take up the challenge to move from \r\nawareness-raising to concrete action, with a view to creating \"A Society for \r\nAll\" by the year 2010. We appreciate, in this regard, that Governments\u0027 \r\nefforts to translate programmes into projects that would benefit the disabled \r\nat the local and national levels must be met with concrete international \r\nsupport. There is much to be said for increasing the effectiveness of the \r\nUnited Nations in addressing the issue of disability, and indeed all social \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n34 \r\n(Mr. Moultrie. Bahama.!) \r\ndevelopment issues. Efforts to strengthen the Social Development branch of \r\nthe Centre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs, including the \r\nDisabled Unit, have always had the support of the Bahamas. The Organization \r\nmust be further enabled to foster consultative links with Member States that \r\nhave programmes based on research findings which have been proven to be \r\neffective and to have long-term positive effects, or that have developed \r\nadvanced technical aids. It should be an important source of information, \r\nanalysis, technical, research and advisory services, particularly to \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\nExtra-budgetary resources have been essential to implement programmes in \r\nthe social development area, which continues to be fundamentally affected by \r\nscarce resources. The Voluntary Fund for the United Nations Decade of \r\nDisabled Persons has demonstrated its worth through its vital catalytic \r\nactivities to benefit the disabled, particularly in developing countries. The \r\nBahamas will join with the Assembly in supporting the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil\u0027s recommendation that the Fund continue after the Decade of Disabled \r\nPersons, with revised terms of reference reflected in its proposed new name, \r\nthe United Nations Voluntary Fund on Disability. If the Fund is to bolster \r\nnational, regional and international disability activities, generous \r\ncontributions would have to be made by those in a position to do so. \r\nThe Bahamas believes that this commemoration should have immediate and \r\nlong-term significance. Detailed efforts are now being made to ensure that in \r\n1993, we have in our service a comprehensive framework for maintaining the \r\nmomentum in countering disability following the end of the United Nations \r\nDecade of Disabled Persons. With the World Programme of Action at its centre, \r\nand the practical guidelines contained in the long-term strategy and the \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n35 \r\n(Mr. Moultrie. Bahamas) \r\nstandard rules on the equalization of opportunities for the disabled, we \r\nshould be ready to address all aspects of disability, whether they affect the \r\nindividual\u0027s capacity for mobility, communication or social interaction. The \r\nBahamas is committed to making its contribution to ensure that the momentum of \r\nthe United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons is maintained into the \r\ntwenty-first century. \r\nMr. KABIR (Bangladesh): At the outset, may I express my profound \r\ngrief and sympathy for the brotherly people of Egypt, who have been struck by \r\na severe earthquake, resulting in such a heavy loss of life and of property. \r\n\u0027* Civilized societies have evolved on the fundamental belief that human \r\nbeings are born with equal opportunities guaranteed to all without \r\n:\" discrimination. Social prejudices and the inadequate understanding of true \r\n\u0027\u0027\u0027\"human potential have, however, often blocked our paths to this cherished \r\n\u003el-objective. In the process, many did not receive the attention that they \r\n:Hi;deserve from society based on the principle of equality. A group that has \r\n-suffered as a result is the world\u0027s disabled. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n36 \r\n(Mr. Kabir. Bangladesh) \r\nAn estimated 500 million people in the world today suffer from physical \r\nor mental disabilities, and 80 per cent of them live in the developing \r\ncountries. Social prejudices and neglect have driven a great many of them to \r\na life of isolation and frustration and have deprived them of the basic \r\nelements of normal living conditions, which cannot but have a jarring effect \r\non broad social harmony and social conscience. \r\nThose of us who are fortunate enough to be able to call ourselves sound \r\nin body and mind have a collective responsibility towards our less fortunate \r\nfellow human beings to help them integrate themselves into the mainstream of \r\nsociety. Their problems should not be viewed with the attitude of doling out \r\nhandouts of pity but with forbearance and compassion. The arbitrary decision \r\nto consign them to their fate as permanent beneficiaries of social welfare is \r\nno longer acceptable. We have a duty to help transform the disabled into \r\nproductive forces by exploiting in full their potentials, however limited. \r\nFortunately, there is an awareness today of the need to address the issue \r\nof the disabled as a matter of common concern. At this forty-seventh session \r\nof the General Assembly, the issue of disabled persons bears particular \r\nsignificance, as it marks the end of the United Nations Decade of Disabled \r\nPersons. We are gathered today not just to take stock of the progress of the \r\nWorld Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons, but to reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to complete what has been left incomplete and reiterate our \r\ndetermination of what we can best do to strengthen our efforts for the future. \r\nOur achievements in terms of statistics will no doubt vary from nation to \r\nnation, especially with respect to availability of funds, technical knowledge \r\nand support services. While in the developed societies commendable \r\nadvancements have been possible to improve the conditions of the disabled, the \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Kabir. Bangladesh) \r\nsituation remains critical in the developing countries, especially in the \r\nleast developed ones. The efforts of developing countries to address the \r\nissue of the disabled are undertaken against formidable challenges, the most \r\nserious being the lack of adequate financial resources. \r\nInadequate nutritional intake and a lack of proper medical facilities \r\naccount for a large number of physical deformities, among both adults and \r\nchildren. Political instability and violence resulting from social \r\ndisorganization have added to the growing numbers of the disabled. Extreme \r\npoverty and low levels of socio-economic development have imposed severe \r\nlimitations on efforts to rehabilitate disabled persons and integrate them \r\ninto society. Due to poverty and lack of employment, the disabled are often \r\n: driven to capitalize on their handicap by resorting to begging as a livelihood. \r\nThe democratically elected Government of Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia \r\n; in Bangladesh is committed to the people and to bringing about a society based \r\non social justice and equitable opportunity. Among the many challenges that \r\nj, lie in the way of that objective is the issue of disabled persons. Our \r\n,, Government is aware of the gravity of the issue and is determined to bring \r\n. about improvement in the conditions of the disabled. The policies and \r\n, programmes undertaken in this regard are formulated within the general \r\n. guidelines of the World Programme of Action. Allow me to share with the \r\nAssembly some of the steps we have undertaken. \r\nEqualization of opportunity is the central theme of the World Programme. \r\ni\u003c \r\nPull and equal participation of disabled persons can be achieved only through \r\ntil\u0027 \r\ntheir economic independence. The Ministry of Social Welfare, which serves as \r\ni1 \r\nour national focal point, is dedicated to imparting specialized vocational \r\nIII \r\ntraining to the handicapped and to turning the hands outstretched in begging \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n38 \r\n(Mr. Kabir. Bangladesh) \r\ninto hands of production. To this end, the Government has undertaken various \r\nprogrammes in both rural and urban areas for income generation by the disabled \r\nthrough training- and production-oriented activities. Specialized educational \r\ninstitutions are being set up to cater for the special needs of the disabled. \r\nThe Government has set up a centre called Employment Rehabilitation of the \r\nPhysically Handicapped and a number of training and rehabilitation centres for \r\nthe blind and for vision- and hearing-impaired persons. The Government, as a \r\nmatter of principle, encourages community-based rehabilitation with an \r\nemphasis on self-employment and cooperative programmes. Interest-free loans \r\nare also provided to assist such persons in setting up small income-generating \r\nenterprises. It is widely recognized that there is a need to create a healthy \r\nsocial environment where the disabled person can live in dignity as a \r\nself-respecting individual and not as just a passive recipient of compassion \r\nand pity. In this regard, the mass media are being utilized to educate the \r\npublic away from social prejudices towards the disabled. A Welfare Trust for \r\nthe disabled at the national level under the Ministry of Social Welfare has \r\nbeen entrusted with the formulation of policies and the coordination of \r\nefforts of pertinent Government organizations and non-governmental \r\norganizations to bring about change in the attitude of the people towards \r\npersons with disabilities. \r\nThose who are intellectually handicapped, and thereby unable to think out \r\nor articulate their needs and desires, are even more in need of special \r\nrecognition. Adequate provision must be made for special care, education and \r\ntraining to prepare them for life in the world when their families are no \r\nlonger there to protect them. \r\nSo unambiguous and total is my Government\u0027s commitment to stand by the \r\ndisabled that last year Prime Minister Begum Zia personally associated herself \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n39 \r\n(Mr. Kabir. Bangladesh) \r\nwith programmes for the welfare of the mentally handicapped by inaugurating in \r\nDhaka the Bangladesh Institute of the Mentally Retarded. For its construction \r\nthe Government provided a grant of 15.02 million taka to the Society for the \r\nCare and Education of Mentally Retarded, a leading non-governmental \r\norganization in the field. Later she also opened in Dhaka the National \r\nComplex for the training of teachers for both the physically and \r\n, intellectually handicapped. \r\nIt is gratifying to note that at this stage of human civilization many of \r\nthe causes of disabilities can be prevented if only proper knowledge and \r\n, technology are available at the right time. In this regard our Government\u0027s \r\n. programme to reform eating habits and to motivate the people to use \r\nnon-traditional and inexpensive sources of nutrition has produced impressive \r\nresults towards the prevention of blindness and deformation at birth. The \r\nextended programmes of immunization and primary health care have also been \r\nstrengthened, with special attention given to mother-and-child health care. \r\nFamily-planning programmes are also being carried out as a national priority \r\nId! \r\nto build healthy families. \r\nIt is, however, a sad reality that disabled women and children suffer the \r\nmost as they often comprise the most vulnerable sector of the population in \r\nS\u003c\"\u0027: \r\nmany countries. Bangladesh is no exception; yet we endeavour to give priority \r\nto the special needs of these groups. Bangladesh, as a State party to the \r\ntil! \r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, also upholds the rights of disabled \r\n*\u0027\u0027 \r\nchildren, particularly in the field of education, training, health care and \r\nill*5 \r\nrehabilitation. \r\n**\u0027 \r\nA large number of non-governmental organizations in Bangladesh, some with \r\nthe participation of disabled persons themselves, are involved in projects for \r\nt̂  \r\nthe prevention of disabilities and the rehabilitation of the disabled. Their \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n40 \r\n(Mr. Kabir. Bangladesh) \r\nhelp and assistance have lent substantial support to our ongoing programmes. \r\nHere we acknowledge the assistance provided by friendly countries whose \r\nGovernments and non-governmental organizations have helped in the area of \r\nservices for the welfare of both intellectually and physically disabled \r\npersons. \r\nThe sincerity of our intent is, however, greatly overshadowed by severe \r\nconstraints on our resources. The varied and complex nature of social issues \r\nthat coexist in conditions of underdevelopment makes the issue of the disabled \r\nonly one among many. With the issues so many and the means so few, the \r\njugglery of choosing our priorities is indeed taxing and often painful. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n41 \r\n(Mr. Kabir. Bangladesh) \r\nWe note with appreciation that the International Meeting on the Roles and \r\nFunctions of National Coordinating Committees on Disability in Developing \r\nCountries held in Beijing in 1990, the meeting on alternative ways to mark the \r\nend of the Decade held in Finland in the same year and the recent ministerial \r\nmeeting held in Montreal, have all acknowledged the problems faced by the \r\ndeveloping world in the implementation of the World Programme of Action. \r\nTheir findings and recommendations deserve our close attention. \r\nWhile we acknowledge that the principal responsibility for improving the \r\ncondition of disabled persons lies with national governments, international \r\norganizations must play an important role in supplementing national efforts. \r\nIt is equally important to establish partnership between developing and \r\ndeveloped countries, especially in the field of technical and economic \r\ncooperation. As noted earlier, financial constraint is the most serious \r\nobstacle to implementation of programmes for the disabled. In this regard, \r\nthe developing countries should be assisted by countries of the developed \r\nworld. Dissemination of information and the transfer of technology at a \r\nconcessional rate to the developing countries is another area which should be \r\naddressed with priority. We also feel the need for appropriate legislation \r\nfor protecting the rights of the disabled. \r\nThe World Programme of Action is designed for all nations, and the \r\ncapacity of individual countries to implement it must therefore be evaluated \r\nfrom this point of view. The Vienna affirmative action plan formulated by the \r\n»orld symposium of experts on technical cooperation among developing countries \r\nand technical assistance in disability prevention and rehabilitation offers a \r\ncomprehensive set of suggestions to meet challenges faced by the developing \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Kabir. Bangladesh) \r\ncountries. Its full implementation calls for a three-way partnership among \r\nnational governments, donor countries and international organizations. \r\nWe commend the very important role that the United Nations has been \r\nplaying in ameliorating the conditions of disabled persons world wide. The \r\nCentre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs, the designated focal \r\npoint for coordinating programmes for the disabled within the United Nations \r\nsystem has our full support. I would be remiss if I did not also mention the \r\nspecialized agencies, in particular the United Nations Children\u0027s \r\nFund (UNICEF), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \r\nNations (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International \r\nLabour Organisation (ILO), which have been doing impressive work in the \r\ndeveloping countries, especially in providing policy guidance and mobilizing \r\nresources for activities relating to the disabled. \r\nWe believe that better coordination among the specialized agencies \r\nthrough the adoption of a system-wide action plan within the United Nations is \r\nan area where we should focus attention. \r\nWe welcome the decision of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), \r\ntaken during its July session, to continue the Voluntary Fund for the United \r\nNations Decade of Disabled Persons beyond the decade under revised terms of \r\nreference. In this regard we endorse the idea contained in paragraph 13 of \r\nthe Secretary-General\u0027s report (A/47/415) that the Fund should have an \r\nappropriate mix of regular and extrabudgetary resources. In the past we have \r\nseen that the Fund has suffered, as voluntary funding was not always \r\nforthcoming; and programmes run the risk of curtailment where funding is not \r\nalways predictable. \r\nAs the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons draws to a close, many \r\nof its objectives remain unfulfilled. But this should not be a reason for \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n43 \r\n(Mr. Kabir. Bangladesh) \r\ntotal disappointment. The Decade no doubt has helped to bring about a change \r\nin social attitude towards the disabled and in raising awareness of their \r\nspecial needs. It has brought about a shift to address the issue of \r\ndisabilities from a viewpoint of charity to one of empowerment. Our priority \r\ni \r\nmust therefore be to carry the awareness generated by the Decade into the \r\nfuture from mere urgings of advocacy to concrete actions. National, \r\n) \r\nregional and international efforts must focus on the development of an \r\nintegrated theme to include prevention, rehabilitation, social integration and \r\nprovision of equal opportunities for full participation by disabled persons in \r\n\"the development activities of countries. In this regard, we fully endorse the \r\n\"recommendation contained in the report (A/47/415) for the adoption of a \r\n\"long-term national action plan for the period 1993-2002, encompassing the \r\nthree main elements - prevention, rehabilitation and equalization of \r\n\u0027\"opportunities. As this period also coincides with the Asian-Pacific Decade of \r\n\u0027-Disabled Persons, recently proclaimed by the Economic and Social Commission \r\nfor Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), Bangladesh reaffirms its full commitment to \r\nlithe welfare of the disabled in the coming years. \r\nii\u0027 We have seen in reviewing the Programme of Action for the Decade, that in \r\nn\u0027many countries programme have been mostly urban-centric with little focus on \r\ni»the disabled living in rural areas. Secondly, as pointed out in the \r\n({Secretary-General\u0027s report, programmes for persons with a mental disability \r\n,s:«ere the weakest in many countries. Indeed we must also appreciate that \r\n,ji intellectually or mentally disabled persons deserve a little more attention. \r\njjlt is our hope that these issues will be appropriately addressed in our future \r\nProgrammes of action. I would also like to suggest that as we go beyond the \r\nĵ ecade of Disabled Persons, we must reconsider and speak of them as persons \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n44-45 \r\n(Mr. Kabir. Bangladesh) \r\nwith disabilities rather than as disabled persons, as with a little help from \r\nus many of them can and do function as able persons. \r\nThe goals we seek will remain elusive unless the underlying issues of \r\npoverty and underdevelopment are overcome. The profound developments in \r\npresent-day international relations have thrown open rare opportunities for \r\ninternational cooperation to address this basic and vital issue of the welfare \r\nof persons with disabilities. We sincerely hope that the hands of cooperation \r\nwill not shrink on the grounds of insular policies and deny us the \r\nlong-cherished opportunity to change our lot. \r\nIn standing on the threshold of a new century, we hold a vision of hope. \r\nThere are enough reasons to believe that we will not be pursuing an illusion \r\nto establish a society for all by the year 2010 if we have the political will \r\nto do so. \r\nMr. WEBSON (Antigua and Barbuda): Antigua and Barbuda join with the \r\nrest of the world community of nations in applauding the efforts of the United \r\nNations in the Decade of Disabled Persons. We are honoured to be part of the \r\ndiscussion that evaluates the activities of that Decade. \r\nI come from a part of the world that is so beautiful that millions of \r\npeople leave distant lands by air and by sea to feast their eyes on our \r\nregion\u0027s beauty. The Caribbean\u0027s beauty is legendary; yet many thousands of \r\nus do not have the chance to see the physical beauty of our region because we \r\ncannot see. Many thousands of us do not have the chance to enjoy the \r\npulsating rhythm for which we are so famous because we do not hear, and yet \r\nmany more because of barriers cannot enjoy the brilliant country we live in. \r\nNevertheless I can attest to the inner beauty of my countrymen, who understand \r\nthe need to make all hands useful in the development process of our country. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n46 \r\n(Mr. Webson. Antioua \r\nand Barbuda) \r\nMaking possible the contribution of disabled people in my small \r\nCaribbean-island developing country is an important policy consideration. And \r\nyet, even in my Antigua and Barbuda, so much remains to be done. \r\nIn 1992, as we evaluate the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons, I \r\nshould like to offer selected snapshots of the Decade\u0027s significant \r\nachievements. I shall also recount some of its shortcomings, and I shall \r\nbriefly look at some of the considerable challenges that lie ahead for \r\ndisabled persons. \r\nUndoubtedly, the major achievement of the Decade was increased \r\nunderstanding and knowledge of disability issues among policy makers, \r\nplanners, service-providers, parents and disabled persons ourselves. \r\nIncreased media coverage, public awareness campaigns and commemorative events \r\nfocused on people with disabilities and contributed positively to a greater \r\nacceptance of society\u0027s responsibility to remove obstacles to full \r\nparticipation for disabled persons. Such obstacles include prejudice and \r\ndiscrimination, all of which result from social and cultural factors. \r\nThroughout the Decade disabled persons and our many organizations \r\nsuccessfully increased our influence. In some places, we gained new respect \r\nin our communities as we achieved greater independence. In other places, \r\nlegislation and the machinery of the State worked to improve our material \r\nconditions and to increase our access to community resources. \r\nWithin the past decade in my country, for example, all blind and \r\nvisually-impaired children have been integrated into the regular school \r\nsystem. We have also expanded the services offered by the school for the \r\nhearing impaired. Through the efforts of disabled people in Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, a council for the handicapped has been established; it has succeeded \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Webson. Antigua \r\nand Barbuda) \r\nin persuading the Department responsible for the census to include the \r\ndisabled as a category in its census-taking. \r\nSeveral teachers of the blind and visually-impaired and of the \r\nhearing-impaired have been trained abroad and in our Caribbean region. A \r\nprogramme has been established and supported for the mentally retarded, and \r\nthrough our school system we have established activities to incorporate the \r\nneeds of the learning-disabled individual. The Government of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda has continued to pay attention to the needs of the adult blind \r\npopulation, through its support for its industrial workshop, which has been in \r\nexistence for more than 40 years. \r\nThese incremental improvements are the direct result of resolution 37/53, \r\nof December 1982, proclaiming these past 10 years the United Nations Decade of \r\nDisabled Persons. \r\nPositive achievements in some places have been overshadowed by certain \r\ngrim realities in others. There is continued debate over defining disability,\u0027: \r\nthe confusion of the definition does not, however, detract from the fact that , \r\nin war-stricken countries and those affected by famine the number of disabled , \r\npersons of obviously disabled persons has increased dramatically. Today \r\nit is estimated that 500 million people, the equivalent of 6 per cent to ;| \r\n10 per cent of the world\u0027s population, have been identified as having one or \r\nmore disabilities. Of these people, 160 million are women and 140 million are. \r\nchildren. Moreover, it is estimated that 300 million people with disabilities,̂  \r\nlive in developing countries and that less than 10 per cent have access to \r\nbasic health and education services and adequate sanitation. \r\nAs populations grow, as poverty spreads, as famine and armed conflicts \r\nexplode, the developing world is faced with the alarming prospect of \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n48-50 \r\n(Mr. Webson. Antigua \r\nand Barbuda) \r\nsignificant increases in our disabled population. Severely disabled persons \r\nthose with physical and sensory disabilities and many others, including the \r\nwheelchair-bound - will account for a significant percentage of the increase \r\nin the number of disabled persons brought about by human tragedy not of their \r\nmaking, but, rather, resulting from the actions of many of their countrymen, \r\nover which we have no control. In addition to becoming victims of \r\noverpopulation, poverty, famine and wars, marginally healthy disabled persons \r\nwill be attacked by diseases, and many of them will die of causes not of their \r\nown making. \r\nUnemployment will also attack the dignity and independence of an \r\noverwhelming number of disabled persons. The disabled remain among those \r\ngroups with the highest rates of unemployment in our world today, and this \r\nmatter must be given significant consideration. Unemployment among disabled \r\nI \r\npersons may have persisted because of discrimination in hiring and the lack of \r\ntraining and special education. Disabled persons will be largely unable to \r\nfind employment if this situation continues, even at the end of our Decade. \r\nA strategy to end our unemployment plight might begin with the disabled \r\nchild. Social services and training reaching out to the parents of disabled \r\nchildren, embracing the disabled child and the disabled young adult, would \r\ngreatly enhance personal development. The overwhelming need for training is \r\nmost apparent at the end of the Decade. Official development assistance \r\noffered by developed countries and through United Nations agencies could focus \r\nmore closely on the needs of the disabled during the post-Decade period. Such \r\na strategy would help in bringing disabled persons into the mainstream of our \r\nsocieties. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. Webson. Antigua \r\nand Barbuda) \r\nThe Decade of Disabled Persons, with all its promise, was caught in a \r\nworld that has seen some of the most significant political changes in our \r\ntime. History will probably record the end of the cold war, the dismantling \r\nof an empire, and the reduction of the threat of nuclear war as the most \r\nrapid, most dramatic and critical changes ever to take place in a single \r\ndecade. These welcome changes, however, not only diverted the world\u0027s \r\nattention and shifted the focus away from the disabled, but they succeeded in \r\nmoving critical fiscal resources to other segments of the world\u0027s population. \r\nThe promise to set aside resources for the disabled, in concert with our \r\nneeds, has not been fulfilled. \r\nThe challenge of refocusing attention and economic resources is now the \r\nnew goal. We are cognizant of the economic problems which now beset our world \r\nand the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor will exacerbate the \r\nconditions of disabled persons in developing countries. We are aware that \r\ndisabled persons need new alliances if we are to strengthen our cause. \r\nDisabled persons will reach out to women, to minorities and to the aged, \r\nconfident that together we can collectively influence national governments and \r\nthe international community. \r\nThe conclusion of the Decade of Disabled Persons offers the opportunity \r\nfor a renewed commitment on the part of the international community to the \r\nobjectives of the Decade\u0027s Programme of Action. There is a need for new and \r\nadditional financial resources and institutional arrangements to move the \r\ndisability programme from the level of awareness to action. \r\nAt the national level, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda is pledged: \r\nfirst, to undertake a comprehensive review of its policies, programmes and \r\nsupport services for nationals with disabilities in the post-Decade period; \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. Webson. Antigua \r\nand Barbuda) \r\nsecondly, to develop a comprehensive and coherent policy to further the \r\nintegration of disabled persons into the mainstream of our society; thirdly, \r\nto establish and strengthen a national coordinating mechanism to monitor and \r\noversee the implementation of the action plan for the disabled; and, fourthly, \r\nto explore the possibility of establishing within the legislative body a \r\nstanding committee on the status of disabled persons and a procedure for \r\nannual reporting on the progress made in implementing the plan of action. \r\nWhile much has been achieved over the Decade, it is obvious that the goal \r\nof full and equal participation is far from realization. However, the \r\nequalization of opportunity is an ideal towards which all nations must strive. \r\nThe year 1992 marks the end of the United Nations Decade of Disabled \r\nPersons; it does not mark the end of disabilities. Yet, this period has laid \r\nthe foundation for further action to ameliorate the effects of disabilities. \r\nAntigua and Barbuda sees 1992 as a transition year in which we take stock of \r\nwhat has been learned during the Decade. Now is the time to build upon the \r\nawareness raised throughout the Decade. Now is the time to put new approaches \r\ninto practice, and to turn this moment in history into an opportunity for the \r\nfurther integration of all disabled persons into society. \r\nThis is the challenge. This is the goal. The expansion of services, the \r\nbroadening of alliances of disabled groups and the elimination of preventable \r\ncauses of disability: this will guide us into the future. \r\nMr. WOZNIAK (Poland): The year 1992 marks the end of the United \r\nNations Decade of Disabled Persons. The delegation of Poland considers it \r\nappropriate to evaluate the progress and failures in the implementation of the \r\nWorld Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons. \r\nA/47/PV. 36 \r\n53-55 \r\n(Mr. Wozniak. Poland) \r\nIn our opinion, the main obstacle to the success of the Decade is the \r\nlack of national coordinating machinery for the implementation of the World \r\nProgramme in many countries. Insufficient information and outdated concepts \r\nwith regard to dealing with disability still prevail. Nevertheless, much has \r\nbeen achieved in the course of the Decade, especially by building on the \r\nawareness raised throughout the last ten years. \r\nEnvironmental pollution, technical advancement, all kinds of stress, \r\nvarious addictions and other situations created by the fast pace of living are \r\nresponsible for the formation of new groups of disabilities. On the other \r\nhand, in developing countries and in countries in transition many situations \r\narise that result in disabilities in people owing to the insufficiency of \r\nsocial care. \r\nThis is so in different regions of the world and it is a complex \r\nproblem. There are different kinds of disabilities in proportion to the level \r\nof development in specific regions or countries. \r\nA great part of the responsibility for this situation is to be placed \r\nupon the people who take decisions concerning the fate and situation of the \r\ndisabled. Since the second half of 1989 my country has begun to introduce \r\ncomprehensive, fundamental and structural reforms and to put into practice \r\nmarket economy mechanisms. Despite well-known economic difficulties, we have \r\ntaken some concrete steps in favour of disabled people. For example, \r\naccording to the provisions of the Act of Employment and Vocational \r\nRehabilitation of the Disabled, issued by the Polish Parliament on 9 May 1991, \r\na new institution the Government\u0027s Plenipotentiary for the Disabled - has \r\nbeen established at the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n56 \r\n(Mr. Wozniak. Poland) \r\nThe tasks of the Plenipotentiary for the Disabled include, in \r\nparticular: first, the preparation of policy guidelines in the field of \r\nemployment, rehabilitation and the working conditions of the disabled; \r\nsecondly, the coordination of the Government\u0027s activities carried out for the \r\nbenefit of the disabled; thirdly, the expression of opinions on draft \r\nlegislative acts concerning the employment, rehabilitation and living \r\nconditions of the disabled; and, fourthly, the periodical survey of the \r\nimplementation of regulations in the field of employment and rehabilitation of \r\nthe disabled. \r\nThe Act under consideration has provided for the establishment of the \r\nState Rehabilitation Fund for the Disabled. The resources of the Fund will be \r\nused to support medical, social and vocational rehabilitation of the disabled, \r\nand in particular: first, to create new workplaces and adapt existing ones \r\nfor the disabled; secondly, to organize training and retraining courses for \r\nthe disabled; thirdly, to construct and modernize establishments serving the \r\nvocational, medical and social rehabilitation of the disabled; fourthly, to \r\ncreate sheltered workshops and appropriate activities; fifthly, to create \r\nrehabilitative and social infrastructures; sixthly, to obtain additional \r\nfinancing of bank-credit interest; and, seventhly, to grant loans. \r\nAs can be concluded from the above considerations, the Act of Employment \r\nand Rehabitation of the Disabled and the post of Plenipotentiary \r\nfor the Disabled, as well as the State Rehabilitation Fund, are the main \r\ninstruments of the Government\u0027s employment policy for the disabled. Moreover, \r\npromoting the position of Plenipotentiary to the level of the Council of \r\nMinisters is actually under consideration. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Wozniak. Poland) \r\nMy Government recognizes the very important role of the non-governmental \r\norganizations. Every significant regulation and decision that is made in \r\nPoland concerning disabled persons is arrived at in consultation with the \r\nappropriate non-governmental organizations and trade unions. \r\nIt is obvious that the goal of full equalization of opportunities for the \r\ndisabled is far from being realized. However, the United Nations and its \r\nspecialized agencies provide a good conceptual basis for effective national \r\npolicies, and it is very useful to implement these United Nations guidelines. \r\nIn conclusion, in marking the end of the United Nations Decade of \r\nDisabled Persons, my Government has drawn up the draft of the Charter of \r\nRights of the Disabled, which is to be adopted soon by the Polish Parliament. \r\nThis Charter comprises 14 basic rights for the disabled, and we hope that it \r\nwill improve the situation of this group of people in our society. \r\nMr. O\u0027BRIEN (New Zealand): The marking of the conclusion of the \r\nUnited Nations Decade of Disabled Persons is indeed one of the important \r\nevents of this session of the General Assembly, and to have participated in it \r\nis a special experience on the personal level. New Zealand attaches special \r\npriority to offering a contribution to this meeting, along with members and \r\nrepresentatives of the disabled community, many of whom, as we have witnessed, \r\nhave had to surmount not merely the barriers of geographic distance to be here \r\ntoday. The New Zealand Minister of Social Welfare, the Honourable Jenny \r\nShipley, and the New Zealand Minister of Health, the Honourable Simon Upton, \r\nregret that it has not proved possible for them to be present here today, but \r\nthey have asked me to extend their greetings to all present and to \r\ncongratulate those who have been in the forefront of the United Nations \r\nefforts. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr. O\u0027Brien. New Zealand) \r\nReforms which have taken place in New Zealand have received special \r\nimpetus as from the 1981 International Year of Disabled Persons. The New \r\nZealand Government acknowledges the strong role undertaken by non-governmental \r\norganizations in this whole effort, often in partnership with the Government. \r\nHew Zealand wishes all success for the two days of discussion that we are now \r\nexperiencing and it will study the results and proposals for ongoing activity \r\nwith determined interest. \r\nThe New Zealand Disabled Persons Assembly is very proud that \r\nRehabilitation International at its 1992 World Congress in Nairobi accepted \r\nthe Assembly\u0027s invitation to come to New Zealand for the World Congress \r\nin 1996. The President, Ms. Marilyn Baikie, looks forward to welcoming \r\ndelegates in New Zealand, who will share with others the programmes they have \r\ndeveloped to kindle enthusiasm, energy and innovation. \r\nThe practice whereby the United Nations declares decades dedicated to \r\nspecial issues - for example, in respect of racism, disarmament and drug \r\nabuse plays a real part in raising international awareness about particular \r\nissues. And the Decade of Disabled Persons has unquestionably improved public \r\nl! \r\nunderstanding of disability issues and spurred initiatives by Governments. \r\nAction at the global level needs to be complemented by regional action, and \r\nii; \r\nNew Zealand is particularly proud to be a sponsor of the Asia and Pacific \r\nDecade of Disabled Persons, to go from 1993 to the year 2002. We hope that \r\nI * \r\nactivities undertaken during this Decade will result in a strengthening of \r\nthis important region\u0027s national disability programmes and policies. \r\nr* \r\nAwareness i s , of course, one thing and action i s another. We are \r\nti \r\nconscious, as many speakers before me have said, that over the Decade the \r\nA / 4 7 / P V . 3 6 \r\n5 9 - 6 0 \r\n(Mr. O \u0027 B r i e n . New Zea1*njj \r\nnumber of people with disabilities has increased to 500 million, as a \r\nconsequence of disease, famine, malnutrition, poverty, war and violence; that \r\nfinancial constraints are ever present; and that armed conflict - one of the \r\nprimary causes of disability - has increased in several regions of the world. \r\nThe achievements of the Decade are many, but the need for more to be \r\naccomplished is clearly spelled out in the Secretary-General\u0027s report. \r\nIt is right that the Secretary-General has recommended that Governments \r\ngive appropriate priority to disability issues within their programmes of \r\nassistance and technical cooperation. For New Zealand its official \r\ndevelopment assistance programme provides the mechanism through which New \r\nZealand can lend practical support internationally to efforts to meet the \r\nneeds and aspirations of peoples with disabilities. And because our official \r\ndevelopment assistance programme is designed and implemented on a cooperative \r\nbasis with recipient country partners, new Zealand remains receptive to \r\nreguests for assistance of direct benefit to the disabled. In fact, one of \r\nthe specific principles underpinning our programme is that it should safeguard \r\nthe interests of vulnerable groups and increase their capacity to contribute \r\nto development. \r\n\u0027 1 \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n61 \r\n(Mr. O\u0027Brien. New Zealand) \r\nMedical treatment schemes, for example, are an integral part of our \r\ncooperation under existing health assistance programmes in the South Pacific, \r\nwhere the major part of our development effort is focused. These schemes \r\nenable us to supply expert personnel, who provide corrective surgery and \r\nquality-of-life assistance. More generally, too, our support contributes to \r\ncapacity-building and institutional strengthening, which enable partner \r\nGovernments to improve services to their citizens, including people with \r\ndisabilities. \r\nOn the other side of the same coin, New Zealand has over many years \r\naccepted for resettlement numbers of refugees sponsored by the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees. Each year specific provision is included for \r\na number of refugees with medical disabilities. \r\nOur task here is partly to take stock of the past 10 years, and I should \r\nlike, very briefly, to give an overview of developments in New Zealand as our \r\nDecade draws to a close. The number of individuals in New Zealand who have \r\ndisabilities to the extent that they require help with their day-to-day living \r\ncomprises 3.3 per cent of our population of 3.6 million. A little over half \r\nhave age-related disabilities, reflecting New Zealand\u0027s increasingly ageing \r\npopulation. Another 20 per cent have physical or sensory disabilities, the \r\nsame proportion have psychiatric disabilities, and 10 per cent have \r\nintellectual disabilities. \r\nWomen make up 40 per cent of New Zealanders with disabilities, although, \r\nbecause women live longer, they make up a higher proportion of those with \r\nage-related disabilities. Impaired mobility - often arthritis - is the most \r\ncommon disability for women, while for men it is sensory impairment. \r\nA / 4 7 / P V . 3 6 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. O \u0027 B r i e n . New Zealand) \r\nA most significant trend over the past 10 years has been the empowerment \r\nof New Zealanders with disabilities. The International Year and its ensuing \r\nDecade fostered a new awareness that provides the groundwork for this. \r\nEffective representation by people with disabilities of their own interests, \r\ncollectively and individually, has led to a strengthening of partnership with \r\nGovernment. This, in turn, has resulted in Government policies and the \r\nservices available to people with disabilities being developed in new ways. \r\nThere is now a shared aim of improving the quality of life of people with \r\ndisabilities and encouraging independent living. \r\nThe establishment of a Disabled Persons\u0027 Assembly is an innovative step. \r\nThat Assembly brings together representatives of many New Zealanders with \r\ndisabilities, some service-providers and some non-governmental organizations. : \r\nIn representing the interests of these groups to the Government, it helps to \r\nset policy and to establish programmes for people with disabilities. \r\nOver the Decade non-governmental organizations in New Zealand have , \r\nincreasingly taken responsibility for the delivery of support services to h \r\npeople with disabilities. They receive substantial Government funding for \r\nthis work. Another innovation is that in many areas it is the recipients of \r\nservices who provide the quality-control mechanisms. For example, people with \r\nintellectual disabilities and their parents monitor and evaluate the support \r\nservices they receive. \r\nIn the area of disability support services the emphasis is now on \r\nsupporting independent lifestyles and work opportunities. This is reflected \r\nin, for example, the employment field, with the move, over the Decade, away \r\nfrom the provision of work opportunities in sheltered workshops to an emphasi \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. O\u0027Brien. New Zealand) \r\non tailoring vocational-training services to the individual\u0027s needs. Such \r\nservices now range from day-activity programmes to supported-employment \r\nprogrammes with commercial employers. \r\nSport as recreation is a distinctive feature of life in New Zealand. In \r\naddition to the exceptional performance of the 14-member team of young New \r\nZealand athletes at the recent Paralympics in Barcelona, there are those who \r\nparticipate more than convincingly in open competition. New Zealand athletes \r\nrequiring the use of a wheelchair train for and take part in open tennis \r\ncompetitions. A new sport known as mini-twelve sailing is another in which \r\npeople with disabilities are able to take part in open competition. \r\nEqualization of opportunities is the keystone. It constitutes a central \r\ntheme of the Programme of Action, necessitating, in the words of the \r\nSecretary-General, \r\n\"the adoption of policies and mechanisms to break down the barriers to \r\nfull participation and put in place those measures necessary to \r\nfacilitate effective participation.\" (A/47/415, para. 69) \r\n: I shall mention some of the main developments in New Zealand that are relevant \r\ni here. In the field of education there is greater emphasis on mainstreaming \r\ni and the development of appropriate education services, while more specific \r\n,1 services for some disability groups, such as the profoundly deaf, have also \r\nbeen developed. Improved vocational services have created better \r\n,l opportunities for people to enter open employment. The promotion of \r\n^ infrastructures supporting improvements in access to public facilities has \r\nL served to promote independence and self-reliance. There is Government income \r\n, support for many people with disabilities and direct assistance to cover \r\nA / 4 7 / P V . 3 6 \r\n64 \r\n(Mr. O \u0027 B r i e n . New Zeai?mi) \r\nsuch costs as respite care for their families, some home alterations, aids and \r\nappliances and attendance for disability-related medical treatment, as well as \r\nloans to buy cars. \r\nThe most recent reforms, announced last month, concern the integration of \r\nfunding for disability support services with health funding. The growing cost • \r\nof disability support services, and the need for them to be carefully » \r\ntargeted, prompted the Government to embark on an extensive consultation \r\nexercise to define and decide the options for reform. The aim was not to cut i\\ \r\nfunding, but to make the available resources more flexible and more responsive \r\nto people\u0027s needs. j \r\nThe Government has now decided that over the next few years ,, \r\nresponsibility for purchasing support services for people with disabilities , \r\nwill gradually be drawn together under one new agency. Currently this „ \r\nresponsibility is shared between three agencies. The new system will be ,. \r\nrequired to demonstrate positive attitudes to people with disabilities and to ,\u003c \r\nbe community-based and consumer-driven, accountable and flexible enough to \r\nrespond to people\u0027s needs. \r\nThe value of specific legislation to promote equal opportunities for \r\npeople with disabilities has, we believe, been demonstrated in New Zealand. \r\nOur State Services Act requires all State employers to develop and implement \r\nprogrammes to promote equal employment opportunities. Approximately \r\n15 per cent of all people employed in the public sector the State sector -\r\nare identified as having a disability, and it makes sense to ensure that these \r\npeople, alongside all other employees, are enabled to perform their jobs to \r\ntheir full potential. For the last three years the public service has run a \r\ndisability-pride month to raise awareness of the employment issues for people \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n65 \r\n(Mr. O\u0027Brien. New Zealand) \r\nwith a disability. This has culminated in an award for the best workplace \r\ninitiative. \r\nIn the private sector, the adoption of equal employment opportunity plans \r\nis voluntary. But here too it is simply good business for employers to widen \r\ntheir recruitment policies to attract people from diverse backgrounds and to \r\ntreat equitably those people they already employ. This includes people with \r\ndisabilities. Often simple adjustments can be made to working methods or to \r\nthe working environment. \r\nThe benefits to an organization can be considerable. Staff with \r\ndisabilities can bring a different and beneficial perspective to a wide range \r\nof issues. Disability access for employees may improve business by providing \r\nease of access for customers. An employer may also obtain advantage through \r\nimproved perceptions, on the part of clients and the employment market, that \r\nthe organization is a good employer. \r\nFinally, New Zealand proposes to promote the rights of people with \r\ndisabilities by means of draft legislation amending its domestic Human Rights \r\nCommission Act. This will prohibit discrimination on the grounds of physical, \r\nmental and psychiatric disability. The amendment enjoys broad support from \r\nall political parties in the New Zealand Parliament. It is planned that it \r\nwill be enacted in the period ahead. \r\nThese meetings to mark the end of the United Nations Decade of Disabled \r\nPersons are special. We can take satisfaction in the Decade\u0027s achievements. \r\nWe should pay tribute to all those who have worked for its success. But it is \r\nalso a time for commitment to the removal of the remaining barriers and \r\nobstacles that prevent people with disabilities from participating fully in \r\nsociety. New Zealand is wholly committed to doing this. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n66 \r\nMr. MIFSUD-BONNICI (Malta): On behalf of the Government and people \r\nof Malta, I wish to convey my deepest sympathy to and solidarity with the \r\nGovernment and people of Egypt on their recent tragedy. \r\nSince its very beginning, the United Nations has recognized and has been \r\naware of the developmental and humanitarian issues related to the growing \r\nneeds and problems of the disabled all over the world. It has also recognized \r\nthat modernization and higher living standards will eventually bring about a \r\nchange in norms, modes and attitudes, which will in turn have a bearing on the \r\npersonality and role of the disabled in society. \r\nThe upsurge of interest by the international community in the conditions \r\nof the disabled is reflected in various resolutions and declarations adopted \r\nby the United Nations General Assembly. The specialized agencies of the \r\nUnited Nations have also given priority consideration to the question of the \r\ndisabled and have a long record of work carried out related to disability. \r\nAll these efforts culminated in the World Programme of Action concerning \r\nDisabled Persons and the Decade of Disabled Persons. \r\nThe effective measures recommended in the World Programme of Action may \r\nbe broadly classified under four headings: first, prevention of disability; \r\nsecondly, rehabilitation; thirdly, opportunities for the disabled equal to \r\nthose of the whole population, as well as an equal share in the improvement of \r\nliving conditions; and, lastly, full participation of the disabled in the \r\ncountry\u0027s social life and development. \r\nDisabled persons, like other citizens, are entitled to a decent living, \r\nii \r\nadequate education and work opportuni t ies . In Malta these undeniable rights \r\nI \r\nare guaranteed in the Constitution. Through its strategies, my Government \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n67 \r\n(Mr. Mifsud-Bonnici. Malta) \r\naims at securing the fullest possible degree of integration for the disabled \r\ninto Maltese society. Solidarity within the various strata of society is \r\nstrongly believed to be the most effective means to overcome the barriers that \r\nhandicap the disabled and marginalize them from the rest of society. \r\nSensitive to the needs of the disabled, and fully aware of the problems \r\nthat could emanate therefrom, the Government has over the past years \r\nformulated and implemented policies that contribute substantially to the care \r\nand support of the disabled. Government efforts to promote full participation \r\nof disabled citizens in all respects are being significantly complemented by \r\nthe services provided by a number of voluntary organizations, foremost among \r\ni which are the institutions of the Roman Catholic Church. \r\nAcknowledgement of the need to rationalize the use of available resources \r\n[ and to promote cooperation and coordination between the main service providers \r\nji led to the setting up, in November 1987, of a National Commission for the \r\nDisabled. This Commission, with representation of the relevant Government \r\n.; Departments of Welfare, Social Security, Labour, Education, Health and Social \r\ng. Housing, officials from the Federation, parents of disabled children, disabled \r\n, persons and medical and paramedical personnel, is responsible for promoting \r\n,., public awareness with regard to the disabled and for disseminating any \r\n., relevant information. Moreover, it aims at increasing opportunities for the \r\ncontinued involvement of the disabled in all facets of social life. The \r\n• specific aims and objectives of this autonomous body are: first, to ensure \r\n„ the implementation of Government policies vis-a-vis the disabled individual, \r\nW \r\nhis family and voluntary organizations; secondly, to ensure coordination and \r\ncooperation between the relevant Government departments in the implementation \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n68 \r\n(Mr. Mifsud-Bonnici. Maltha) \r\nof objectives prepared in the Government\u0027s plan of action in this field and \r\nthose recommendations made by the Commission itself; thirdly, to maintain \r\nclose contact and communication with voluntary organizations; fourthly, to \r\nidentify the needs of disabled persons, their families and organizations and \r\nto take the necessary steps to see that such needs are met through the \r\nappropriate centralized services; and, lastly, to follow up new initiatives \r\ncoming from within it, as well as those suggested by persons concerned in this \r\nfield, and carry out the necessary feasibility studies. \r\nThe Commission has established a structure that should enable it to \r\nattain its objectives, which are basically congruent to the recommendations \r\nmade in the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons and in \r\nconnection with the Decade of Disabled Persons. This structure includes the \r\nsetting up of 15 subcommittees that focus their activity on specialized \r\nfields, thus ensuring to a considerable degree that every effort is made to \r\nmeet the Commission\u0027s mandate in any particular specialized area. The \r\nCommission\u0027s activities over the past months clearly reflect full recognition \r\nof the fact that the family environment is the one best suited to the li \r\nlifestyle of the disabled, as well as awareness of the pressure which certain 4 \r\ndemands made by a disabled person may in turn exert on the other family \u00279 \r\nmembers. 5; \r\nIt is indeed noteworthy that the Government has taken action on a number ii \r\nof recommendations made by the Commission for the Disabled. ;: \r\nThere is a wide range of special medical facilities, including prevention J \r\nprogrammes, together with financial benefit entitlements, substantial rebates ;t| \r\non import duty payable on cars, and total exemption from the payment of road »ij \r\ntax on specialized vehicles for disabled drivers. All these are measures that i,( \r\nwere conceived with the primary aim of promoting self-independence and social \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n69 \r\n(Mr. Mifsud-Bonnici. Malta) \r\nintegration for those members of society who, because of their disability, may \r\nvery easily find themselves marginalized. \r\nThere is a wide range of special medical facilities and services \r\nbenefiting the disabled. Among the preventive measures taken to reduce the \r\nincidence of disability, screening for thyroidism has been started on all \r\nnew-born babies. Around 14 months of age, children are given the triple \r\nvaccination against mumps, measles and rubella. In order to enable the \r\nearliest possible detection, diagnosis and immediate necessary curative and \r\nremedial intervention, an \"at-risk register\" for new-born babies with \r\ndisabilities has been introduced. Last year a Child Development Advisory Unit \r\nwas set up to carry out a multidisciplinary assessment of disabled children. \r\nThis multidisciplinary team would then advise and counsel the child\u0027s parents \r\nand would thus also serve as a resource centre on matters relating to the \r\ndisabled. Rehabilitation services include the free provision of technical and \r\nmobility aids, as well as physiotherapy, speech therapy and occupational \r\ntherapy sessions in Government health centres. \r\nExisting policies have been reviewed so as to meet the actual needs of \r\nthe disabled individual. Social security provisions have been amended so that \r\nj \r\nnow a disabled person in receipt of a pension can still take up paid \r\nI \r\nemployment without forfeiting the right to a pension once the income so \r\nderived does not exceed the national minimum wage. \r\nii\u003c \r\nThe environment is an important element that can further accentuate a \r\ndisability by creating a social handicap. Housing is undoubtedly a prime \r\n|? \r\nfactor in this respect. Adequate and accessible housing facilities contribute \r\nii\u0027 \r\nconsiderably towards making it possible for disabled persons to have an \r\nindependent life. In recognition of this, the Government of Malta gives \r\n,i \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n70 \r\n(Mr. Mifsud-Bonnici. Ma1f?) \r\npreferential consideration to families with disabled members when it comes to \r\nthe allocation of subsidized plots of land or the award of ground-floor \r\napartments provided under Government housing schemes. Moreover, the \r\nDepartment of Social Housing allocates grants to disabled persons in order to \r\nhelp them undertake improvements to their residence, such as the installation \r\nof a lift or stair-lift facilities. \r\nAnother major area of concern that requires our immediate attention is \r\naccessibility to the surrounding environment. Through the recently approved \r\nStructural Plan, my Government has ensured that new buildings are accessible \r\nto all, and every attempt is being made to improve accessibility to existing \r\npublic buildings. \r\nHowever, decent accommodation on its own does not necessarily fulfil the \r\nneeds of a disabled person. Therefore, housing provisions had to be \r\ncomplemented by such community strategies as the Home Care/Help Scheme and the \r\nspecial telephone lifeline provided under the Telecare Service, which are all \r\ndesigned to give the necessary care and support to the person concerned, as \r\nwell as to his care providers. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n71 \r\n(Mr. Mifsud-Bonnici. Malta) \r\nThe need to provide support for those who provide care has also been met \r\nthrough the setting up of a respite centre where disabled children benefit \r\nfrom rehabilitative and leisure activities that are specifically organized for \r\nthem, while their relatives are given essential periodic relief from the \r\nstrenuous task of caring for them. The establishment of this foundation for \r\nrespite care services is a further expression of the principle of helping \r\ndisabled persons achieve the utmost level of participation while at the same \r\ntime enhancing and strengthening the quality of life of their families. \r\nEducation is an indispensable asset at all levels. A disabled child can \r\nnever be denied the right to adequate education as this is a further \r\ninvestment in his or her future independence as an adult. Special schools are \r\n, designed to meet the educational needs of children having special difficulties \r\nof a physical, mental, sensory or psychological nature. Once these children \r\ni complete their edcuation they may choose to attend training centres that \r\n, provide remedial and vocational individual educational programmes in art, \r\n. woodwork, bookbinding, cane-knitting, the making of soft toys, dressmaking and \r\ncrochet. Such rehabilitation programmes are designed to promote independent \r\nliving and the possibility of engaging in gainful employment. \r\nEmployment possibilities for disabled persons is another target we have \r\nset and aspire to achieve. The Government, together with the National \r\nCommission for the Disabled and voluntary organizations, has established the \r\nfirst computer laboratory with the aim of training and consequently helping \r\nphysically disabled persons to find suitable employment. \r\nThe Disablement Resettlement Unit has been set up to assure proper \r\nimplementation and to advise on the improvement of the Disabled Persons \r\n(Employment) Act 1969, which, among other things, made provisions for the \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n72 \r\n(Mr. Mifsud-Bonnici. Malta) \r\nkeeping of a special employment register for disabled persons and required \r\nemployers to employ a quota of these registered unemployed disabled persons. \r\nAs another measure designed to enhance self-sufficiency, the Social Aid \r\nFund has been set up to award grants, out of specifically allocated public \r\nfunds, to help disabled persons acquire technical aids. Moreover, should the \r\namount required exceed the grant provision ceiling, recommendations are made \r\nto a commercial bank for the issue of a loan at a reduced rate of interest. \r\nThe effectiveness of existing policies and the introduction of new \r\nstrategies depend heavily on our ability to understand the changing needs of \r\nthe disabled individual as dictated by constant social and economic changes. \r\nResearch programmes are believed to be the best monitors of met and unmet \r\nneeds, of specified and unspecified wants, as well as a database for the \r\nplanning of future policies. \r\nThe University of Malta is conducting one such research programme for \r\ndisabled children attending special schools, with the aim of having a \r\ncomprehensive assessment of each child and a solid foundation on which to \r\nbuild a rehabilitation programme for each individual. \r\nThe findings of the extensive national survey organized by the National \r\nCommissioin for the Disabled are being processed. Once this exercise is \r\ncompleted, the Commission will be in a better position to assess and analyse \r\nthe extent of the various actual as distinct from assumed needs of those \r\nfalling within the parameters of its responsibility, namely the disabled. \r\nIt is encouraging to note that the Maltese people are becoming more \r\ncognizant of the fact that the issue of disability does not merely ask for \r\ncare provision but for the involvement and participation of the disabled \r\nwithin the community. Such an acknowledgement should prove to be a sound \r\nfoundation that would ultimately give the disabled the opportunity to develop \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n73 \r\n(Mr. Mifsud-Bonnici. Malta) \r\ntheir personality in a dignified and respected manner. Only when the \r\nable-bodied radically change their attitude towards the disabled do we really \r\ncease to handicap the disabled. This should be our challenge for the years to \r\ncome. \r\nThere was great satisfaction for me and for all those who attended the \r\nfirst meeting of the International Conference of Ministers responsible for the \r\nStatus of Persons with Disabilities, held in Montreal last week. The \r\npolitical will of all those present to achieve full participation and \r\n1 integration of the disabled in society was paramount. May all of us translate \r\n- words into action so that we will achieve the common goal we are all aiming \r\n1 for. \r\n\u0027 Mrs. OTTOLINA (Venezuela) (interpretation from Spanish): I feel \r\ndeeply moved to be able to participate in this important forum of nations, \r\n(whose main purpose earns it the title of forum of love for humanity. \r\ni The very fact that the world parliament is opening its doors and devoting \r\nill two full days to discussion at special meetings of the General Assembly \r\nattests to the achievements of the Decade of attention that the world has \r\n,i: given to the disabled. It is most encouraging to know that everything is \r\n,,;important to all nations everywhere. If something has been achieved in the \r\n^Decade of the Disabled, it is the removal of barriers and working together to \r\n^increase awareness, thereby ensuring the integration of the disabled. \r\n,j. Something has been done perhaps a great deal, but a great deal still \r\n,remains to be done. \r\nV \r\nr In these discussions we have learned about the tremendous achievements \r\nill\u0027\u0027 \r\n.that have been made in some countries, and we have also heard about the \r\n.tremendous needs that other nations confront. Thanks to this invaluable \r\nHi!\u0027 \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n74-75 \r\n(Mrs. Ottolina. v«n»«T.-| aj \r\nexchange of information, we will be able to decide upon joint future action \r\nthat can effectively reach the broad population of disabled that remain on the \r\nmargin of society because of society\u0027s deficiencies. \r\nHere I should like to emphasize that we are not the ones who are \r\ndisabled. No! It is societies that are unable to respond to unexpected needs \r\nthat are disabled. We must not forget this. \r\nMajor efforts must be made to transform cities and to educate societies, \r\nto ensure that in their development they can utilize the immense value locked \r\naway in the hearts and souls of those who are now unjustly marginalized. \r\ni \r\nIt is important for all of society to be able to capitalize on the great \r\nil \r\npotential of these human beings. Common knowledge recognizes the courage, the \r\n\u0027«\u0027 \r\nstrength of will, the efforts, and the spirit of struggle and self-improvement \r\nthat mark the life and existence of the disabled. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n76 \r\n(Mrs. Ottolina. Venezuela) \r\nI am a member of the Venezuelan Parliament, and this requires from me \r\ngreater responsibility and a greater commitment: to incorporate my country \r\ninto the challenge that humankind has set itself, to contribute resolutely to \r\ntaking initiatives and finding effective solutions that will maximize the \r\ncapabilities of so many people people who are tremendously qualified to \r\nparticipate in the wonderful adventure that this world offers. The secret of \r\nthe origin of the universe is being deciphered thanks to the talents of a man \r\nwho has flown very far, farther than anyone, and who, from the immobility of \r\nhis wheelchair, has ventured to go forward and explore the cosmos. This is a \r\nperson whom the Earth still refers to as disabled: Stephen Hawkings, a \r\nuniversal example. \r\nGreat efforts are being deployed in Venezuela. I must state proudly and \r\nyet with a touch of sadness that we have begun for the first time to enact \r\nlegislation for the advancement and integration of disabled persons. I say \r\nthis with pride because we have done so, and with sadness because I \r\nacknowledge the fact that this is but a small step. A written law is not \r\nenough. The real process of integrating the disabled requires that society \r\nitself arrive at the realization that we are all equal and that we all have \r\nthe same rights. We must move into the area of equality of opportunity, and \r\nwe have begun this process. \r\nIn that connection, I would like to pay tribute to the tremendous effort \r\nthat was made on 8 and 9 October last by Mr. Robert de Cotret, Secretary of \r\nState of Canada, who, with the support of his Government, convened an \r\nunprecedented meeting in Montreal. Seventy-six Ministers attended, and the \r\ncountries there present agreed to make joint and continual efforts to take \r\nmeasures aimed at establishing suitable mechanisms that would make possible \r\nthe most important thing of all: to help us help ourselves. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n77 \r\n(Mrs. Ottolina. Venezuela) \r\nWith this kind of good will, with the good will of the United Nations and \r\nwith all of you who are here representing the political will of our respective \r\nnations, I believe that the time has come, not to celebrate the conclusion of \r\nthe Decade of Disabled Persons, but rather to begin a joint and sustained \r\neffort for decades to come. \r\nI must emphasize as an example that in the hospitable city of Montreal, \r\nwhose high level of culture was reflected in its ability to respond to the \r\nvarious needs of those of us who required particular attention, I definitely \r\nfelt less disabled, less limited entirely integrated. Thank you, Canada. \r\nThere are millions of people who do not have the privilege of knowing of \r\nthis progress and whose lives are wasted, spent in dark despair, because no \r\none could or knew how to help them, or, what is even worse, because they did \r\nnot have the means to pay. \r\nIt is on behalf of those people that I should like to plead today. It is \r\nbecause of them that the world is meeting here, so that in the near future -\r\nthe very near future, we hope - absolutely no one will be denied the \r\nopportunity and the right to live a full and dignified life without being \r\nsubjected to the cruelty of having that denied them simply because of a lack \r\nof resources. I am convinced that the capabilities and the will to accomplish \r\nsomething in that respect exist here. \r\nNothing, absolutely nothing, is more beautiful than seeing a smile on the \r\nface of a disabled person who now feels capable, because that is the smile of \r\na person who has won, who has conquered life - the smile of a winner. If it \r\nis in our capacity to givt. fiat person such a smile, let us do so. \r\nThe essential values .\u003e! a human being transcend the world of the physical \r\nbody and are intact in the spirit, in the mind and in the soul. They are \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n78-80 \r\n(Mrs. Ottolina. Venezuela) \r\nthere for those who seek to find them. No disability whatsoever exists that \r\ncan prevent or hinder that search. Quite to the contrary: that search \r\nfrequently becomes the key par excellence to open the way to that world - a \r\nfar better world. \r\nI wish to bear witness to the fact that one can succeed, that one can be \r\ni happy. One can with integrity and dignity walk in the world with something \r\ni other than legs. But I must acknowledge that this can be accomplished only \r\n. with a little bit of help from all our friends. \r\ni Thank you for your participation, thank you for your obvious concern and \r\nr very great thanks for your attention. \r\nr Mr. BHAGAT (India): I should like to begin by expressing my \r\n, profound grief at the terrible earthguake that has struck Egypt, and I send \r\nthe Indian delegation\u0027s sympathy to its disaster-stricken people. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n81 \r\n(Mr. Bhaqat. India) \r\nI deem it a privilege to address the United Nations General Assembly \r\nduring these special plenary meetings marking the conclusion of the Decade of \r\nDisabled Persons. At the outset, I wish to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis report contained in document A/47/415. \r\nDeveloping countries like India cannot escape the grim reality that up to \r\nhalf a billion people around the world are disabled and that over 80 per cent \r\nof those people are in the developing world. As has often been the case in \r\nsituations of grave social concern on a global scale, the United Nations has \r\nnot only played a pioneering role, but has also given leadership to \r\nGovernments and non-governmental organizations to take a special interest in \r\nthe welfare of the disabled. The observance of the Decade of Disabled Persons \r\nhas served to focus attention on this matter of global concern. \r\nToday, although there is a growing awareness of the need to integrate the \r\ndisabled fully into the social mainstream, it is unfortunate that in many \r\nsocieties they still face prejudice, largely due to ignorance. In fact, they \r\nhave an important contribution to make to society, since the disabled are \r\noften highly acute and have above-average sensitivity and intelligence in \r\nareas where they suffer no disability. They can provide extremely useful \r\ninputs for humanity as a whole. Moreover, like other citizens, they are \r\nentitled to the full enjoyment of human rights. \r\nThe General Assembly in 1982 adopted a World Programme of Action \r\nconcerning Disabled Persons and an initial time-frame within which to \r\nimplement it\u0027. This has now been extended. As noted in the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report, social and economic factors closely determine a \r\nsociety\u0027s behavioural pattrrns towards its less fortunate members. Therefore, \r\nunless social and economic conditions improve significantly, legislation alone \r\nwill not help in the betterment of the lives of the disabled. It is therefore \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n82 \r\n(Mr. Bhaaat, India) \r\nnot surprising that the achievement of the ambitious objectives of the \r\nProgramme of Action has been slow. \r\nThe United Nations Decade has, however, led to the adoption of policies \r\nin many countries and has forged international cooperation for the assistance \r\nof the disabled, while taking into consideration the particular needs of \r\nindividual countries. The need of the hour is not just greater awareness and \r\nunderstanding of this pervasive and often tragic problem, but the will to \r\nact. This is especially true when one realizes that many cases of disability \r\ncould have been prevented if proper heed had been taken at the right time. \r\nHere I speak of congenital disabilities resulting from the use of drugs, or \r\ndue to alcoholism or smoking by pregnant women. \r\nThe disabled do not need pity or charity. What they need from all of us \r\nis support and, I repeat, the will to act and help to help themselves. Here \r\nthe strong family structural patterns of the developing world could \r\nspontaneously provide a source of strength for any member of a family who is \r\ndisabled. \r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s report contains an ambitious programme of action, \r\nwhich by the end of 1993 will have components such as the Programme, providing \r\na strong policy framework, and the long-term strategy, which will set definite \r\ntargets to be achieved within specific time-frames. It calls for national \r\naffirmative action for the period 1993-2002, encompassing those components. \r\nWith the creation of widespread awareness, this is a model programme which \r\nGovernments could follow. \r\nIt is also commendable that United Nations specialized agencies have \r\nPlayed a significant supportive role. The International Labour Organisation \r\n(ILO) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have established \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n83 \r\n(Mr. Bhaaat. India) \r\ncommunity-based programmes to assist and rehabilitate the disabled in several \r\nLatin American and African nations; other organizations have worked to prevent \r\nthe spread of blindness, particularly in Africa and Asia. Several other \r\norganizations have worked for the rehabilitation of disabled children and \r\nrefugees. \r\nMy Government has, in its own modest way, been working for the betterment \r\nof the disabled. Their number in India is estimated to be around 12 million. \r\nSeveral national institutes have been set up for their education, training, \r\ncounselling and rehabilitation. A sum of $70 million has been set aside in \r\nthe national budget for the period of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, from 1992 to \r\n1997, for the welfare of the disabled. \r\nAt the request of the General Assembly, our former Prime Minister, \r\nMrs. Indira Gandhi, launched the international IMPACT programme in India. It \r\nis jointly sponsored by the UNDP, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the \r\nUnited Nations Children\u0027s Fund (UNICEF). The ambitious target set for India \r\nwas the reduction of the major causes of avoidable disabilities by one third \r\nin the first 10 years. Our success story is the 80 per cent immunization \r\nachieved so far in the cities of India and the fact that the eradication of \r\npoliomyelitis in the next 10 years is conceivable. India was the first \r\ncountry to launch eye camps; in 1991 alone 1.2 million cataract operations \r\nwere performed in India\u0027s village eye camps. The Indian Government has \r\ncooperated closely with United Nations agencies to make India a leading \r\nsuccess story for the IMPACT programme. The Lifeline Express, donated by the \r\nIndian railways, for example, performs 150 major operations a day in rural \r\nIndia. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n84-85 \r\n| (Mr. Bhaoat. India) \r\nA major programme of the Indian Government was the granting of \r\nscholarships to the disabled on the basis of means cum merit tests. Other \r\ninitiatives included the setting up of special employment exchanges for the \r\nplacement of the disabled and the reservation for the disabled of 3 per cent \r\nof Group C and D posts in central government and public sector undertakings. \r\nThe observance of the International Year for Disabled Persons in 1981 \r\ngave a fillip to the expansion of services throughout the country. A number \r\nof employment, travel and other concessions were extended to the disabled, \r\nboth by the central Government and by State Governments. Among other \r\nprogrammes were the integrated education of the disabled in vocational \r\nrehabilitation centres, apprenticeship training programmes and the \r\nestablishment of district rehabilitation centres. \r\nEvery year the President of India presents National Awards to outstanding \r\nemployers of disabled persons and to the most efficient disabled employees or \r\ndisabled self-employed persons in the Government and private sectors. The \r\nGovernment of India has set up a National Disabled Welfare Fund, with \r\nvoluntary contributions from the public sector, the private sector and the \r\ngeneral public. The Fund is utilized to augment existing voluntary services \r\nfor the welfare of the disabled. \r\nIn this context, I should like to mention the phenomenal success of the \r\n\"Jaipur Foot\", an artificial, flexible limb developed by doctors at Jaipur in \r\nour State of Rajasthan, which has been used successfully by many thousands in \r\nIndia. It has also been made available at affordable prices. There has been \r\ninterest in its application for the war-wounded in countries like El Salvador, \r\nNicaragua and Cambodia. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n86 \r\n(Mr. Bhaoat. India) \r\nThe year 1993 has been designated the South Asian Association for \r\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC) Year for the Disabled. India hopes to \r\nparticipate fully along with our neighbours in the SAARC programmes proposed. \r\nUltimately, the best support that we can give to these unfortunate \r\nbrethren is the common realization among all of us that society\u0027s well-being \r\nlies in large measure in the welfare of the disabled among us. \r\nMrs. MUNTEANU (Romania) (interpretation from French): Before making \r\nmy statement, I should like to extend my people\u0027s heartfelt sympathy to the \r\nEgyptian people in their suffering. \r\nI should like to express my thanks for the invitation to participate in \r\nthis work and to say how delighted I am to have this opportunity to meet so \r\nmany of my colleagues and friends and to share with you our ideas, our \r\nconcerns, our satisfactions and dissatisfactions regarding the status of the \r\ndisabled in our respective countries and throughout the world. \r\nI would like to try to organize my statement around three themes: first, \r\nphilosophy, programmes and an overview of work done for disabled persons; \r\nsecondly, national effort and the need for greater international cooperation \r\nin the field of policies and approaches to the disabled; and thirdly, the \r\nestablishment of a permanent international mechanism which would seek to \r\nenhance the status of the disabled. \r\nWe share the view that, despite progress made at the national and \r\ninternational levels, the status of the disabled is still of concern, and that \r\nefforts should\u0027be stepped up, along with international cooperation, to bring \r\nabout greater changes in society\u0027s attitude and to achieve truly independent \r\nliving for the disabled. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n87 \r\n(Mrs. Munteanu. Romania) \r\nBearing in mind the provisions of the declaration of the 1991 Paris \r\nmeeting of European ministers in charge of policies for the disabled, along \r\nwith the conclusions of the Vienna ad hoc working group, which analysed the \r\nstandard rules on the subject in order to speed up equalization of opportunity \r\nfor the disabled, and those of the first international conference, recently \r\nheld in Montreal on the initiative of Mr. Robert de Cotret, to whom we are \r\nvery grateful, we have tried to identify certain features of a coherent policy \r\nfor the disabled that we wish to submit to you. \r\nWe are convinced that a valid, credible policy for the disabled must \r\ninclude the following elements: relevant provisions in the legislation of \r\neach country concerning the specific rights of the disabled; the incorporation \r\nof the rights of the disabled in international instruments on the subject; the \r\nadoption of national programmes on medical, psychological, pedagogical and \r\nsocial and vocational rehabilitation, with precise goals covering all aspects \r\nof life, including the establishment of special institutions with the full \r\nparticipation of the disabled; the gradual elimination of obstacles and \r\nbarriers of all kinds and of prejudices against the disabled, through joint \r\nactions of institutions and agencies which might be conducive to a new \r\napproach to disability; and the organization, at the national and \r\ninternational levels, of an ongoing campaign to increase the sensitivity of \r\nthe public, in institutions and in governmental and non-governmental bodies, \r\nregarding the problems, needs and frustrations of the disabled, in order to \r\ntry to find suitable solutions to these problems with the participation of the \r\nwhole of society, and to jive disabled people a feeling of dignity, usefulness \r\nand full participation in community life. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n88 \r\n(Mrs. Munteanu. Romania) \r\nAs regards the programmes and the results of initiatives for the \r\ndisabled, we are all aware of them, and I do not wish to dwell on them. I \r\nmerely wish to say that I fully agree that concerted efforts within the \r\nframework of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons and the World \r\nProgramme of Action concerning Disabled Persons, as well as the initiatives \r\ntaken by other international meetings, have produced significant progress. \r\nInternational cooperation in any field, including the domain of the \r\ndisabled, must be closely related to the national policies of States in this \r\narea. \r\nBasing itself on the general concept of observance of human rights, \r\nRomania has drafted and implemented as of 1989 a coherent programme to bring \r\nabout a speedy, meaningful improvement in the status of the disabled. \r\nThe difficulties that my Government has encountered and in particular \r\nthose encountered by the Secretariat of State for the Disabled, which has just \r\nbeen set up, have been quite sizeable: obsolete technology in existing \r\ninstitutions and their endowments; an acute lack of specialists and know-how; \r\nand a mentality regarding and approaches to disabled persons that have been \r\ndistorted by forty years of totalitarianism. \r\nThe implementation of the national programme for special protection for \r\nthe disabled has enabled us not only to make tangible improvement in the \r\nstatus of these people but also to raise awareness and to involve in this \r\ncomplex and difficult endeavour both governmental and non-governmental \r\ninstitutions as well as public opinion. \r\nReal support has been provided by the international community, and I wish \r\nto take this opportunity to say how grateful Romania is to all those who have \r\nshown understanding and solidarity with my country. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n89-90 \r\n(Mrs. Munteanu. Romania) \r\nThe positive results obtained by Romania in a rather short time, thanks \r\ntlso to international cooperation, encourage us to go forward and to seek, \r\n:ogether with other countries, the best means of finding, through our common \r\n•ffort, the best solutions so that disabled persons may be enabled to use \r\ntheir creative potential, enjoy truly independent lives and play a dignified \r\nrole in the life of the community. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n91 \r\n(Mrs. Munteanu. Romania) \r\nThe existence and proper functioning of a national body has meant that we \r\nnow have an overview and can contribute to the programmes and operational and \r\nlegislative initiatives for the disabled and that we can intervene \r\nperiodically to implement them. \r\nWe are certain that at the international level more consistent \r\ncoordination and cooperation is necessary. \r\nIt is clear that in order to have better information about the \r\nexperiences of various countries and in order to gather the necessary data for \r\nan exact and specific evaluation of national and regional needs to better \r\nimplement international standards and to benefit from the know-how of other \r\ncountries in the field of assistance to the disabled, we all need a \r\nwell-defined international structure - a permanent, inexpensive but effective \r\nmechanism which should be part of the specialized agencies of the United \r\nNations. \r\nI wish to highlight some of the advantages and facilities that a \r\npermanent international structure could give to cooperation among countries. \u0027 \r\nFirst of all, a permanent structure is necessary in order to coordinate t \r\nand monitor implementation of world-wide and regional programmes for the \r\ndisabled. \r\nExperience has demonstrated that similar programmes require adaptation as \r\nwell as ongoing consultations and, in particular, a coordination of efforts at , \r\nthe regional and global levels, which can only be effective if there is a \r\npermanent structure that can act or intervene at any time. * \r\nA permanent mechanism can become a very effective instrument in defending , \r\nindividual rights if it intervenes promptly in given situations, cooperates \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n92 \r\n(Mrs. Munteanu. Romania) \r\nwith Governments and helps mobilize public opinion to encourage people to \r\ntreat the disabled on an equal footing with other citizens. \r\nOne might envisage an ongoing public and governmental awareness campaign \r\nunder the aegis of an international secretariat. Such a campaign would \r\npromote a better understanding of the status of the disabled and of how \r\nindividuals and institutions can help improve it. \r\nA permanent structure could play a despatching role to facilitate a \r\nworking partnership and to provide assistance for setting up pilot projects. \r\nIt could provide a means of exchanging project data, experience and \r\nopportunities which would obviously lead to greater cooperation among States. \r\nThat is why Romania is firmly convinced that States involved in \r\ninternational cooperation for the disabled should not scatter their resources \r\nand knowledge in individual parallel projects which are costly and sometimes \r\nof limited impact. \r\nA concerted effort through the establishment of permanent machinery might \r\nprove to be more beneficial for the disabled as well as for international \r\ncooperation designed to hjlp them. \r\nInternational cooperation for the disabled has taken on obvious \r\nmomentum. The work of our meeting is proof of this. However, to maintain the \r\nmomentum on a permanent basis requires a proper and highly competent \r\norganizational structure. \r\nHuman solidarity and international cooperation, which are the goal, \r\nrepresent a powerful force that can change the future and, through a new \r\nphilosophy, point the way to a society for all. \r\nIt is up to us to meet this challenge. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n93 \r\nMr. PENNANEACH (Togo) (interpretation from French): A cruel tragedy \r\nhas just befallen the people and Government of Egypt involving great loss of \r\nlife and material damage. At this difficult time for that fraternal people, \r\nmy delegation wishes to convey sincere condolences and feelings of solidarity. \r\nTen years ago, the United Nations proclaimed the United Nations Decade of \r\nDisabled Persons. Now that it is coming to an end, we should take stock of \r\nthe results, evaluate the successes, take note of the obstacles encountered \r\nand define new ways in order better to attain the goals of the World Programme \r\nof Action concerning the Disabled. \r\nIn participating in this discussion, the delegation of Togo wishes to \r\nreaffirm its solidarity with and profound sympathy for all persons who are \r\npartially or totally disabled, as well as our firm commitment to strengthen \r\nmeasures to bring about their full integration into society. \r\nThe proclamation of 1983 to 1992 as the Decade of Disabled Persons has \r\ndrawn increased attention to the disabled and to their integration. This \r\ndifficult but necessary process requires not only comprehension and support \r\nbut proper funding. \r\nThe Decade has brought the disabled into the mainstream of society; it \r\nhas recast their image as complete people enjoying all of the rights and - in \r\nso far as possible all of the duties inherent in the human condition. In \r\nTogo, through their various associations, the handicapped used every means at \r\ntheir disposal, last year, to bring about a change in public attitudes so that \r\nthey might be accepted as :.n integral part of the human community. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n94-95 \r\n(Mr. Pennaneach. Togo) \r\nIn implementation of the World Programme of Action to mark this Decade, \r\nTogo has drafted legislation and undertaken a campaign aimed at preventing \r\ndisability and at providing medical equipment and vocational training.* \r\nMr. Dangue Rewaka (Gabon), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n96 \r\n(Mr. Pennaneach. Togo) \r\nIn the field of disability prevention a specific immunization programme \r\nhas been drawn up and is being very carefully implemented in collaboration \r\nwith the United Nations Children\u0027s Fund (UNICEF). This has enabled us to \r\nimmunize children from birth to the age of seven and women of child-bearing \r\nage. Immunization coverage is now at about 36 per cent of the target \r\npopulation. A vast programme to eradicate oncocerciasis covers four countries \r\nof West Africa. The campaign against leprosy, to which my Government, in \r\ncooperation with the Raoul Follereau Foundation, has been committed for more \r\nthan 10 years, is beginning to yield results. \r\nMeasures to reduce the seriousness of disability have been improved. The \r\nNational Orthopedic Centre and the Centre for Functional Reeducation have been \r\nstrengthened. However, the acquisition of orthopedic apparatus is difficult \r\nbecause of the very high cost involved. \r\nBut other specific work has been done for the disabled to make sure they \r\ncan be trained as much as possible: centres have been set up to train the \r\nmentally retarded, deaf-mutes and the blind; within the competent technical \r\nMinistry a structure has been set up to carry out programmes for the disabled; \r\na plan for the vocational rehabilitation of disabled persons has been set up \r\nwith the help of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the United \r\nNations Development Fund (UNDP), UNICEF and the World Health Organization \r\n(WHO). \r\nWith regard to organizing disabled persons, it should be stressed that \r\nthe Togo Federation of Associations of Handicapped Persons has been created in \r\norder better to understand the specific problems linked to the various \r\ncategories of disabled people. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n97 \r\n(Mr. Pennaneach. Togo) \r\nThat, then, is a brief overview of what my Government has been doing \r\npursuant to the World Programme of Action, which is so ambitious and \r\nhumanistic. As can be seen, all the objectives of the Programme have not been \r\nachieved, not for any lack of political will but because the funds available \r\nwere insufficient. \r\nAs is quite rightly - and forcefully stressed by the Secretary-General \r\nin his report, the worsening economic and social situation marked by low \r\ngrowth rates, high unemployment rates, reduced public spending, the \r\nimplementation of structural adjustment programmes, and privatization has \r\nhad a negative impact on programmes and services in developed and developing \r\ncountries alike. \r\nIn fact, the impact has been most negative in the developing countries, \r\nwhere the cruel lack of funding makes living conditions increasingly \r\ndifficult. It is sad to observe that, while the Decade has enabled many \r\ndisabled people from the developed countries to progress even better than \r\nbefore, this has not been the case for those in the developing countries who, \r\nfor the most part, have been left to their own resources. The lot of women, \r\nchildren and people living in rural areas is even worse. \r\nDespite the efforts made by the United Nations within the framework of \r\nthe Decade, the developing countries have not really been able to integrate \r\nthe disabled. Eloquent testimony to this is the situation in this very \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. How many disabled people from the developing countries \r\nhave we seen speak from this rostrum to make their invaluable contribution to \r\nour discussion? How many disabled brothers and sisters have spoken of the \r\nDecade and defended their cause in this community of nations? There could \r\nhave been many of them, but can they afford the trip? \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n98 \r\n(Mr. Pennaneach. Tngn) \r\nHow many disabled persons from the developing countries do we see on \r\ntelevision participating in sporting events or working on a computer? How \r\nmany disabled people from the developing countries have been totally \r\nintegrated into the lives of their cities, or even into the production sector? \r\nMy point is that the road to fully integrating handicapped people in \r\ndeveloping countries is a very long and difficult one. To make that road \r\neasier it is important to strengthen cooperation among nations and to \r\nimplement the recommendations contained in the Secretary-General\u0027s report on \r\nthe World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons. \r\nIt is clear that the developing countries, particularly the least \r\ndeveloped, however important their actions have been on their own, could not \r\nmeet the challenges of the World Programme of Action concerning the Disabled. \r\nWe also note that regional cooperation, which should have provided a \r\nbroader, more forceful framework for the disabled, has suffered in Africa as a. \r\nresult of many problems, particularly the deteriorating economic and social \r\nsituation, political and social problems, armed conflicts, lack of primary . \r\nhealth care programmes, endemic diseases, epidemics, and so forth. \r\nNevertheless, we welcome the work done by international organizations in . \r\nraising the consciousness of Governments and public opinion about the status \r\nof the disabled, as well as the mobilization of financial and material \r\nresources. Togo is grateful to the international organizations and to the \r\nnon-governmental organizations which have helped it implement projects for the \r\ndisabled. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n99-100 \r\n(Mr. Pennaneach. Togo) \r\nThe facts are there, and they emphasize the disparity between countries, \r\nparticularly as regards available funding, technical know-how, and necessary \r\nsupport services for the proper implementation of the United Nations World \r\nProgramme of Action concerning Disabled Persons. \r\nAs this Decade draws to a close, we feel it is increasingly urgent to \r\ncontinue to concern ourselves with the disabled. And that is why my \r\ndelegation fully supports the recommendations made by the Secretary-General in \r\nhis report, and in particular his proposal to find the solutions to the \r\nproblems of the disabled within a context of integrated social development and \r\nby increased awareness and a better understanding of the problems of the \r\ndisabled. My delegation also endorses the following relevant proposals of the \r\nSecretary-General: the adoption of a long-term programme of action for the \r\nperiod 1993 to 2002; the establishment within legislative bodies of a \r\npermanent committee on the status of the disabled; the proclamation of \r\nregional decades; the definition of a programme of action with specific \r\nobjectives taking us to the year 2002; and the creation of an institute, or \r\nnational or regional centre, on disability and the handicapped pursuant to \r\nresolution 46/96. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n101 \r\n(Mr. Pennaneach. Tp^n) \r\nWe think that it is important that there be added to these \r\nrecommendations a recommendation that consciousness should be raised. We need \r\ntrue integration that is carefully prepared from an early age. We must put a \r\nstop to pity and to condescending paternalism. The disabled do not want \r\npity. They are men and women just like us, with their personalities and their \r\nrights, and we must treat them as such. Have we truly abandoned the pathetic \r\nsolutions resulting from that unhappy past of laissez-faire charity or the \r\nintolerable logic based on profit? \r\nDespite the obstacles to implementation of the World Programme of Action \r\nconcerning Disabled Persons for the soon to end Decade, my delegation hopes \r\nthat the international community will give greater attention to the disabled \r\nby using appropriate means to support the implementation of various \r\nsocio-economic programmes designed to secure their full development. In so \r\ndoing, we shall ensure that the disabled are enabled fully to exercise their \r\nlegitimate rights. \r\nMore tolerance and solidarity in the world, right here and now, would , \r\nmake it easier for those who find it difficult to play a full role in \r\nsociety. But vocational integration, like social integration, of physically \r\nor mentally disabled persons and people with sensory disabilities is not just , \r\na question of making declarations of principle or producing rules; it is a . \r\nquestion of political will and concrete action - above all, the expression of \r\nactive fraternity. \r\nThe society of the future, if it is to be a society of peace, must be , \r\nbased on solidarity. We invite all United Nations Members to work for this , \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n102 \r\n(Mr. Pennaneach. Togo) \r\nsolidarity. Instead of excluding the disabled, let us stretch out our hands. \r\nThey will help us to understand and to love; they will, by their deeply moving \r\naction, help to lead us to that more just world of solidarity the United \r\nNations is working to bring about. \r\nMr. ELHOUDERI (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (interpretation from \r\n1 Arabic): I should like, on behalf of my delegation, to condole with and \r\n\u0027 express our full sympathy and solidarity to the fraternal people of Egypt in \r\nthe wake of the earthquake that hit Cairo and caused a large number of deaths \r\n\u0027 and injuries. \r\n\u003e Allow me, Mr. President, at the beginning of my statement, to welcome \r\n« this special celebration which reflects the importance the international \r\ncommunity attaches to the question of the disabled. \r\n\u0027 Our celebration, this year, of the conclusion of the United Nations \r\n•: Decade of Disabled Persons reflects world-wide awareness of the needs and \r\nrights of the disabled, who, it must be understood, have the same rights and \r\ni duties as any other member of society. To ignore the disabled would be to \r\n: overlook considerable human potential, which could be used in construction and \r\nc. development. \r\nr; My country had the honour of initiating the declaration of the \r\n.. International Year of the Disabled, which we celebrated in 1991. It chaired \r\n.fj. the work of the Consultative Body for the International Year with great energy \r\nand vigour, and succeeded in drawing up political guidelines designed to \r\n.achieve the objectives of the International Year. \r\n„ Having been involved in all this, my country would have hoped to be able \r\ni\u0027f \r\nto participate in this important meeting with a delegation that would have \r\nincluded a number of disabled persons, so that they might be given an \r\nopportunity personally to speak of the success that has been achieved in \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n103-105 \r\n(Mr. Elhouderi. r.jhvjll \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\npursuing the objectives of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons and \r\nof the activities under the International Plan for the Disabled aimed at \r\nprevention, rehabilitation and equal opportunity. \r\nUnfortunately, the negative effects of the air embargo against my \r\ncountry, imposed pursuant to Security Council resolution 748 (1992), have made* \r\nit impossible for those disabled persons to take part in this meeting. : \r\nDisabled people in our delegation would have been obliged to use road i \r\ntransport over the great distances involved in reaching an airport in Tunisia -\r\nor Egypt. This would have exposed them to considerable hardship and l \r\nunbearable suffering. : \r\nIndeed, the effects of the embargo are not limited to restricting our r \r\nparticipation in international meetings and conferences of such importance. ; \r\nThe adverse effects of the embargo are felt also in the area of activities ; \r\nrelating to the disabled. I refer to the slow delivery of artificial limbs \r\nand of the medical equipment needed by those people. This creates many , \r\nproblems for the disabled, who are in urgent need of such things in order for • \r\nthem to be able to cope with the burden of their disabilities. . \r\nFurthermore, the air embargo has prevented us from benefiting from the . \r\nservices and assistance of specialists who are needed to examine and treat \r\npatients with severe disabilities. In addition, the embargo has prevented or \r\ncaused delays in the arrival of the much needed medical personnel who work in ̂  \r\ninstitutions providing medical, psychological and social services to the deaf, \r\nthe mute, the mentally retarded, the paralysed and the chronically ill-\r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n106 \r\n(Mr. Elhouderi. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nAll this has led to a worsening of the level of medical services provided by \r\nthose institutions. \r\nWhile we appreciate the positive results achieved through the Decade, \r\nsuch as the increased integration of disabled people into public life, \r\nequalization of opportunities in the areas of education, employment and \r\ntraining, assured participation in the various social, cultural and economic \r\nactivities available to other members of society; and while we also appreciate \r\n\u0027 the growth in numbers and the development of the activities of national \r\n1 committees and agencies responsible for the disabled and the revitalization of \r\ntheir role in national life, we must say that the objectives of the World \r\nli Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons have not been fully achieved. \r\n•c The numbers of disabled have risen to 500 million, 80 per cent of whom live in \r\n:,; developing countries, because of the spread of disease, hunger, malnutrition, \r\ntil poverty, armed conflict, civil war, and deteriorating economic and social \r\ni!E conditions, all of which beset many developing countries. \r\n;;  All these circumstances have led to a scarcity of the necessary resources \r\nrequired to achieve the objectives of the World Programme of Action concerning \r\nj((Disabled Persons. Therefore, we stress the need to adopt a long-term strategy \r\nj. through the year 2000 and beyond in order to ensure the continued \r\n,, implementation of the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons \r\n.0after the conclusion of the Decade with a view to creating a society-for-all \r\n.by 2010. New guidelines aiming at improving the living conditions of the \r\nd̂isabled and fostering their full integration into the community should be \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n107 \r\n(Mr. Elhouderi. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nformulated. Those guidelines should take into account the needs of the most \r\nvulnerable segments of the disabled in the developing countries, such as the \r\nelderly, women and children. \r\nWe set great hope on international cooperation in the area of technical \r\nassistance in providing the needs of the disabled, in particular by means of \r\nthe transfer of technology and the sharing of experience from countries that \r\npossess such technology and experience to countries that do not, in order to \r\nassist in such areas as rehabilitation and the prevention of disabilities. \r\nWe attach great importance to the drawing up of rules and norms with \r\nrespect to equalization of opportunities for the disabled of all cateqories \r\nand all age groups and welcome the work now being done by the working group \r\nwhose job it is to draw up such rules and norms. We hope that the group will \r\nsucceed in concluding its work in time for it to present the results to the \r\nnext session of the General Assembly. \r\nWe pay tribute to the key role played by the United Nations Fund toward \r\nachieving the development objectives of the World Programme of Action \r\nconcerning Disabled Persons. In our view, it is necessary for that United \r\nNations Fund to be maintained even beyond the end of the Decade in view of its \r\nimportance in bolstering national capacities, especially in the area of \r\nrehabilitation and the prevention of disability in many developing countries. \r\nMy country, Libya, was among the first to emphasize the question of the \r\ndisabled at both the national and international levels. This stemmed from our \r\nprofound faith in the human principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n108 \r\n(Mr. Elhouderi. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nand the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In the course of the \r\nInternational Year of Disabled Persons my country enacted Law 3 (1981) \r\nconcerning the disabled. That law included a definition of the disabled, \r\ndefined the groups involved and the advantages and benefits that should be \r\nprovided to them along with the other facilities and services they would need \r\nin the areas of care and rehabilitation, together with education and \r\nretraining, job opportunities, tax and excise duty exemptions, while providing \r\nthem with special facilities in the area of transportation; all in order to \r\nensure the highest possible level of care for the disabled. \r\nIn the area of prevention of disabilities, the Law provided for the \r\nsetting up of a national committee on the disabled whose mandate is primarily \r\nthe prevention of disability and the integration of the disabled into society \r\nboth professionally and socially while providing the best possible living \r\nconditions for them. A number of international organizations have recognized \r\n.that Law as a model to be imitated. \r\nHowever, that Law did not include a provision specifically on the \r\n;prevention of disability. In order to rectify this. Law 5 (1987) was \r\njipromulgated to replace Law 3 (1981). The first provision in Law 5 (1987) \r\n.stipulates the prevention of disability and regards prevention as a \r\n^responsibility of the individual, the family, the community and grass-roots \r\norganizations in society. The new Law defined the various groups of disabled \r\n.persons and set the allowances and benefits provided to each group. It also \r\nmade provision for rehabilitation and defined the role of each government \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n109-110 \r\n(Mr. Elhouderi. Lihyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nagency in this respect. The legislation on the disabled in my country has led \r\nto the setting up of a large number of organizations and special centres that \r\nprovide care together with education and rehabilitation services to the \r\ndisabled in a number of towns and villages including the Centre for the \r\nRehabilitation of Disabled Persons in Benghazi, the one in Tripoli set up in \r\n1983, the institutes that provide medical care for the mentally handicapped in \r\nAziziyah and Massa, the Institute for the Deaf in Benghazi, the Institute for \r\nSpecial Education for the Mentally Handicapped in Ganzour, the Association for \r\nthe Blind in Benghazi and the Society of Light for the Blind also in Tripoli. \r\nThe disabled in my country, through their associations, contribute \r\neffectively not only to the creation of employment opportunities for the \r\ndisabled, but also to the political and economic life of the country in which \r\nthey play a key role like all other members of society. They now have an \r\nactive role to play in decision-making at all levels and in all areas. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n111 \r\n(Mr. Elhouderi. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to pay tribute to the \r\nSecretary-General and to commend him for his report in document A/47/415. My \r\ndelegation supports the recommendations in that report, which call for the \r\nshifting of focus in the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons \r\nfrom awareness-raising to action, with a view to articulating a coherent \r\noverall policy on the integration of disabled persons into the normal life of \r\ntheir communities. My delegation also wishes to express its appreciation to \r\nthe Vienna Centre for the work it is doing in implementing the Programme of \r\nAction despite its limited resources. \r\nIn response to the urgent and growing needs in the developing countries, \r\nwe believe that it is vital to allocate appropriate resources to the Centre to \r\n1 1 1 II \r\nenable it to carry out the activities set out in the Programme of Action well \r\nbeyond the end of the decade. \r\nMr. NOBILO (Croatia): I should like to express the deepest sympathy \r\nof my Government to the Government and people of the friendly Arab Republic of \r\nEgypt upon the terrible earthquake that recently struck Cairo. \r\nCroatia is proud to seize this opportunity to speak at the end of the \r\nUnited Nations Decade of Disabled Persons and on the tenth anniversary of the \r\nWorld Programme of Action. Allow me to express our deep appreciation for \r\neverything the world community has accomplished in organizing and helping the \r\ndisabled to live in an environment that accepts them as they are, and in \r\nlifting all the barriers in architecture and in people\u0027s minds alike. We \r\nare grateful to the Secretary-General and the President of the General \r\nAssembly for ensuring that this important item would be included on the agenda \r\nof the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We would also like to \r\nrefer to the Secretary-General\u0027s praiseworthy report, which contains precise \r\nguidelines for action concerning this item. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n112 \r\n(Mr. Nobilo. Croatia) \r\nThe Decade that is now behind us has been appraised as the \"decade of \r\naccomplishment\". And so it has been, since numerous programmes have been \r\nenvisaged and carried out by many United Nations agencies and organizations \r\nduring the past 10 years. At the same time, there are new challenges and new \r\nrealities, and so we cannot confidently enjoy our results, no matter how we \r\nappreciate them. \r\nMany factors beyond our control cause disabilities. Human actions, \r\nsometimes deliberate, account for many human tragedies in the world. But war \r\nis the most horrible of them all. In the last 40 years Europe has \r\nconcentrated all its efforts on enabling the handicapped to live normal lives, \r\non the presumption that all their problems were part of a peaceful, everyday , \r\nenvironment. Unfortunately, Croatia nowadays is forced to solve the problem { \r\nof disabled persons under conditions of war and as a conseguence of military . \r\naggression. \r\nLet me present some tragic figures. In the Republic of Croatia, during \r\nwar operations over the 15 months prior to 1 October 1992, 5,746 persons were \r\nkilled and 21,269 including civilians and members of the Police Force and : \r\nCroatian Army - were injured or wounded. Consequently, 1,535 of them have . \r\nremained permanently disabled. The numbers are largest for cases of limb \r\namputations and brain and spinal-cord injuries, but also include cases of \r\nblindness, deafness, permanent mental disorder, tetraplegia and paraplegia. \r\nOne third of all wounded - that is, 6,198 people and almost one-half of \r\nthose killed- 1,872 have been civilians, which are unusually high \r\nproportions. \r\ni \r\nThese data represent only the minimal number of confirmed casualties. \r\ni \r\nThe number has increased considerably now that we know that at least \r\n800 civilians have been massacred, executed or brutally murdered in the \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n113 \r\n(Mr. Nobilo. Croatia) \r\noccupied territories of Croatia by Serbian insurgents and paramilitary \r\ntroops. 3,000 are still missing after the fall of the city of Vukovar to the \r\nYugoslav Army, and most of them are presumed killed. The total of missing \r\npersons is 14,852, with the horrifying presumption that most of them are no \r\nlonger alive. \r\nI have to emphasize that the numbers I have given apply only to those \r\npersons who have been accounted for, and do not include all the people \r\n\u0027 presumed killed, injured, missing or held in captivity by the enemy forces. \r\nThe real number, which we are sure will not be available until long after the \r\n• hostilities have ceased throughout the area, is far larger than the one stated \r\n\u0027• or envisaged here. \r\n:- Most of the disabled persons are young men of 20 to 26 years of age. Our \r\n- hospitals and rehabilitation centres are working at their highest capacities \r\nbut can hardly meet the bare necessities. The situation is further aggravated \r\n• by the presence of thousands of soldiers and civilians from Bosnia and \r\n:. Herzegovina, among whom is a significant number of disabled or handicapped \r\n:; persons. Those people have no income, no housing facilities and no \r\ngs possibility of returning to their homes. The Republic of Croatia will \r\n[j continue, however, to provide all the necessary assistance that the wounded \r\n0 and refugees from Bosnia require. But we can do so little without the help of \r\n,,; the world community. \r\n,;! Croatia faces a huge problem in reintegrating its disabled persons into \r\nt everyday life. Mostly very young, they will have to face the problems of \r\nstarting a family and finding employment and homes. Furthermore, they have to \r\n.,. 90 through a difficult process of social adaptation. The heavy burden of the \r\n, post-war period is making this task even more delicate. Serious material \r\nI Problems delay the discharge of casualties upon completion of their \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n114-115 \r\n(Mr. Nobilo. Croatia) \r\nrehabilitation process. Besides the disabled war victims, Croatia has \r\napproximately 450,000 handicapped persons of all categories. Many of them are \r\nhaving growing problems in adjusting to the new situation, especially those \r\nliving in the war-torn areas. \r\nBefore the war Croatia made significant steps towards improving the \r\nliving conditions of disabled persons and integrating them into society. But \r\nthe war has seriously hampered those efforts. Many disabled persons have lost \r\nall their family and are left alone with nobody to care or provide for them. \r\nToday their goal is not to attain the conditions enabling them to participate \r\nin society on a footing of equality with others; their major - indeed, their \r\nonly goal is to survive. Therefore they depend more than any others on \r\nCroatia\u0027s ability to recover as soon as possible from the destruction caused \r\nby the war and to restore its industrial, transportation, and social \r\ninfrastructure to at least the pre-war level. International help is playing a \r\ndecisive role in these efforts. \r\nBecause of the increased number of disabled persons, it has been \r\nnecessary to expand the capacities of Croatian rehabilitation institutions. \r\nThe Republic of Croatia does not have a comprehensive rehabilitation centre \r\nable to treat all types of disability. The absolute priority is to establish \r\na national rehabilitation centre for brain and spinal-cord injuries. Croatia \r\nwill be grateful for all available support in creating that centre. The \r\nDepartment of Information and Research at the Croatian Ministry of Health \r\nissued an appeal to over 100 international humanitarian organizations to \r\nsupport financially the rehabilitation of disabled persons who are victims of \r\nwar. Unfortunately, no positive answer has been received so far. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n116 \r\n(Mr. Nobilo. Croatia) \r\nThe problems Croatia is facing concerning the disabled are great and \r\nincreasingly numerous. Although Croatia has received a significant amount of \r\naid in drugs and medical material, we still need help from the international \r\ncommunity. In spite of all the difficulties, we shall not leave any of our \r\nhandicapped persons without proper care and assistance. \r\nThe basic provision of our civilization is that all men are equal. All \r\n\u0027 men are entitled to equal rights, including the more unfortunate among us. \r\na The World Programme of Action exists, but it still has to be brought to life. \r\n: It is our hope that the consideration of the issue by this high body will give \r\ni further impetus to the improvement of the situation of disabled persons \r\n.1 throughout the world. The Republic of Croatia is ready to do its share. \r\nMr. SHIWEDAH (Namibia): Allow me first of all, on behalf of the \r\nNamibian delegation, to express to the people of Egypt our sincere condolences \r\n•: and sympathy on the loss of life and material damage suffered as a result of \r\nthe devastating earthguake that struck Cairo. \r\n, As we come together to evaluate our achievements of the past 10 years, \r\n,(Ii. where we stand today and the road ahead, I wish to put on record my \r\nf delegation\u0027s appreciation for being a participant in these historic plenary \r\n.,. meetings, the first of their kind. \r\nWe come together when major wars have ceased and world peace seems to \r\n, have been preserved. Not very long ago the Secretary-General, \r\n„ Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, pointed out in his \"Agenda for Peace\" the \r\ninterconnection between peace and social and economic development in these \r\n««\u0027 \r\n, words: \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n117 \r\n(Mr. Shiwedah. Namibia) \r\n\"The social stability needed for productive growth is nurtured by \r\nconditions in which people can readily express their will. For this, \r\nstrong domestic institutions of participation are essential. Promoting \r\nsuch institutions means promoting the empowerment of the unorganized, the \r\npoor, the marginalized.\" (A/47/277, para. 81) \r\nThe link between peace and social and economic development on the one hand and \r\ndisability on the other cannot be overemphasized. Although major wars have \r\nceased, civil strife, poverty, drought, hunger and a lack of health-care \r\nfacilities continue to be a major impediment, especially in the developing \r\ncountries. Thus, in tackling the core problems of disability issues, there \r\nshould be a focus on, inter alia, narrowing the gap between the haves and the \r\nhave-nots. It is in this context that my delegation welcomes the summit for \r\nsocial development to be held in 1995; we hope that the world situation of \r\npersons with disabilities will find a prominent place on the agenda of that \r\nsummit. \r\nTen years ago, when the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons was \r\ndeclared, the people of Namibia were engaged in a war which not only \r\nculminated in our national liberation, but resulted in a large number of \r\npersons, including children, with disabilities. The neglect of persons with \r\ndisabilities by the former colonial Administration in Namibia excluded the \r\ndisabled from all spheres of human life. \r\nThus, following the independence of Namibia on 21 March 1990, my \r\nGovernment placed the situation of the disabled among the priorities of its \r\ndevelopment programmes. Furthermore, the broad framework of fundamental human \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n118 \r\n(Mr. Shiwedah. Namibia) \r\nrights and freedoms enshrined in our Constitution provides tools for the \r\nprotection of their rights and enhanced integration of the disabled in the \r\nspheres of education, health, employment and accessibility and so forth. We \r\nare fully convinced that the achievement of full integration of disabled \r\npersons into mainstream services reguires a multi-disciplinary approach, well \r\ncoordinated policy and action relevant to the needs of disabled persons. My \r\n• Government, therefore, through the Ministry of Lands, Resettlement and \r\ni Rehabilitation, has been instrumental in ensuring that detailed programmes and \r\n. development planning for the provision of services are worked out by other \r\n: Government bodies. \r\nOur achievements during our two years of independence can be attributed \r\nL to the will and determination of the disabled themselves to succeed in the \r\n,. betterment of their lives and the high and personal interest and concern of \r\n:. the President of the Republic of Namibia for the welfare of the disabled. In \r\n1991, when hundreds of disabled persons delegated by their regional \r\norganizations gathered in Windhoek to launch the National Organization of \r\nDisabled Persons, the President of the Republic of Namibia, who himself was a \r\n. participant, launched the National Disability Fund and declared 1992 as the \r\nYear of the Disabled in Namibia. That was done to mark the end of the United \r\nNations Decade of Disabled Persons. \r\nIi* \r\nWhereas 1992 marks the end of the United Nations Decade of Disabled \r\nPersons, for us in Namibia it marks the beginning of raising awareness on \r\nI \r\ndisability; some progress has been made. Through its inter-ministerial and \r\n0 \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n119-120 \r\n(Mr. Shiwedah. Namihia) \r\nnational co-ordination committees, the National Organization of Disabled \r\nPersons in Namibia has been advocating equal rights for the disabled and the \r\nneed to integrate them in the education, health, sports and economic fields. \r\nWhile emphasis has been placed on consciousness-raising and putting \r\nstructures in place all over the country, concrete projects have been embarked \r\nupon with the help of various international non-governmental organizations. \r\nFour capital projects in the areas of agriculture, tailoring, gardening and \r\nleatherwork and other small projects are functioning. Those small projects, \r\nalthough far from being sufficient, create employment opportunities for some \r\ndisabled persons. It is our aim to transform those small projects into \r\ncapital projects and thus generate income. Furthermore, the Private Sector \r\nFoundation renders assistance through credit facilities for self-help projects \r\nby people with disabilities. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n121 \r\n(Mr. Shiwedah. Namibia) \r\nWith assistance from the. International Labour Organisation consultant a \r\ndocument that constitutes the National Policy on Rehabilitation and \r\nIntegration of Disabled Persons has been finalized and is now in operation. \r\nIn February 1993 a seminar will be held to produce a layman\u0027s draft to be \r\nformulated into a draft Bill on national disability legislation. \r\nDespite all those achievements, the road we have to cover in Namibia \r\nremains longer than the distance we have gone. The problems to be tackled far \r\noutweigh the available resources. The lack of trained personnel and \r\ninfrastructure and the unavailability of data and information on the disabled \r\ncompounds our organizational constraints. \r\nWe applaud the achievements set out in the Secretary-General\u0027s report \r\nand wish to reiterate that during the Decade the international community has \r\ncome to realise that disabled persons are citizens with equal rights and \r\nobligations. The emergence of numerous national organizations of the disabled \r\nis in itself testimony that great strides have been made by disabled persons \r\nthemselves in making their communities see them as productive members of \r\nsociety. \r\nNotwithstanding the achievements made over the past 10 years, much \r\nremains to be done. The situation of women with disabilities has not \r\nimproved. In many parts of the developing countries women with disabilities \r\nare still excluded from the health, education and economic spheres, not to \r\nmention the decision-making process. The majority are in the rural areas, \r\nwhere they are heading families, most of the time singlehandedly. Since \r\nNamibia is facing a severe drought, their efforts to fend for themselves and \r\ntheir children are made even more difficult. Hence, the Government, through \r\nthe National Drought Task Force, has decided to provide free food supplies to \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n122 \r\n(Mr. Shiwedah. Namihia) \r\nvulnerable groups, namely, lactating mothers, the aged, the disabled and \r\nchildren. Internationally, women have to cope with discrimination based on \r\ngender and on their disability. Although they are members of national \r\norganizations of disabled persons, their voices are often not heard. It is in \r\nthis context that we welcome the World Conference on Women in 1995. We look \r\nforward to the participation of women with disabilities in that Conference and \r\nthe adoption of concrete programmes and action on women with disabilities. \r\nThey know what they are enduring. Let us give them a chance. Let their \r\nvoices be heard. \r\nIn many parts of the world the will and commitment to alleviate the \r\nsituation of disabled persons is more often defeated by lack of resources. \r\nWhile the United Nations Decade saw no additional resources, the root causes \r\nof the rising number of persons with disabilities poverty, drought, famine, \r\nconflicts were on the increase. Thus, the disproportion between the \r\nresources available and the programmes and tasks we set ourselves for the \r\nDecade impeded the very progress we are aiming for. \r\nThe post-1992 era calls for a shift from awareness-raising to concrete \r\naction. It calls for the enactment of legislation for disabled persons. At \r\nall levels, persons with disabilities should be integrated into the overall \r\nsocial-economic development sphere, and national efforts should be \r\ncomplemented by international will and support. To ensure that the many \r\nprogrammes adopted during the Decade are implemented, my delegation welcomes \r\nthe Secretary-General\u0027s recommendation that possibilities be explored of \r\nestablishing a mechanism whereby reports on the status of disabled persons \r\ncould be presented by disabled persons themselves. \r\nChildren with disabilities must be integrated into regular schools, while \r\ntaking into consideration their specific needs. In this way we shall, at the \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n123 \r\n(Mr. Shiwedah. Namibia) \r\noutset, remove the negative attitude with which children have perceived one \r\nanother. In southern Africa hundreds of children have been left orphans, \r\ntraumatized or disabled by the wars of destabilization that ravaged this \r\nsubregion. We owe those children, and many others in different parts of the \r\nworld, a future. We commend the United Nations Children\u0027s Fund, the World \r\nHealth Organization and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and \r\nCultural Organization for their concrete programmes to make the world a better \r\nplace for children. We welcome the International Conference on Assistance to \r\nAfrican Children, to be held in Dakar, Senegal, by the Organization of African \r\nUnity (OAU) from 25 to 28 November 1992. We hope that that Conference will \r\nalso be the start of a process for improving the situation of children with \r\ndisabilities. The situation of the African child warrants all necessary \r\nsupport. \r\nWe should like to see the organization of regional seminars on people \r\nwith disabilities. Where regional mechanisms exist - as in our region, where \r\nwe have the Southern African Federation of the Disabled they should be \r\nsupported to enable them to render support to the national organizations. \r\nIt is fortunate that the marking of the end of the United Nations Decade \r\non Disabled Persons has coincided with the restructuring of the United \r\nNations. It is our hope that the needs of disabled persons will have a \r\nprominent place on the agenda of United Nations restructuring. There is a \r\nneed to have a permanent structure within the United Nations dealing with \r\nissues of disability. The integration of persons with disabilities should not \r\nbypass the United Nations Secretariat at its various levels. When a permanent \r\nstructure is established within the United Nations, persons with disabilities \r\nshould form part of that body. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n124-125 \r\n(Mr. Shiwedah. Namibia) \r\nUnited Nations technical assistance to developing countries should be \r\nincreased to help alleviate the situation of the disabled. The United Nations \r\nleadership role must be strengthened to enable it to render asistance to \r\nregional and national efforts. Needless to say, the increasing expectations \r\nwill, in turn, require additional resources for the implementation of various \r\nprogrammes at all levels. The United Nations Voluntary Fund on disability \r\nwill need uninterrupted funding. \r\nMr. CASTEDO (Spain)(interpretation from Spanish): First, on behalf \r\nof my Government, I wish to convey our condolences and heartfelt sympathy to \r\nthe Government and people of Egypt on the occasion of the tragic loss of life \r\ncaused by the earthquake that struck the city of Cairo. \r\nSpain, as a member country of the European Community, endorses the \r\nstatement made on behalf of its member States by the representative of the \r\nUnited Kingdom. I wish, however, to give some information about our national \r\nexperience. \r\nTen years ago the General Assembly adopted the World Programme of Action \r\nconcerning Disabled Persons. This year, 1992, is also the tenth anniversary \r\nof the adoption by my country\u0027s Congress of Deputies of the Disabled Persons \r\nSocial Integration Act. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n126 \r\n(Mr. Castedo, Spain) \r\nThat Act advocates the same principles and promotes similar measures in \r\nvirtually the same areas as the United Nations World Programme of Action. \r\nWithout exaggeration, we could describe our Act as the Spanish version of the \r\nProgramme. \r\nThe Disabled Persons\u0027 Social Integration Act was the response that \r\nSpanish society brought to the needs and problems of the community of citizens \r\naffected by some disability. A time frame of 10 years was set for it. It was \r\nenacted as a framework law indicating approaches and paths, giving guidance \r\n\u0027 for strategies for intervention and types of organization and entrusting the \r\n1 various departments explicit and concrete mandates all of which is part of \r\nan overall and coherent vision of the entire spectrum of problems affecting \r\n\u0027 the disabled. \r\n• The Act embodies a large number of principles as guidelines for global or \r\n•- sectoral action respecting the disabled community. Social integration as the \r\nultimate aim and only way of success for the many measures proposed, instead \r\n1 of fragmented or marginal strategies; basing of services and benefits on \r\ntf rights, which is a break from the earlier tradition of charity or benevolence; \r\nV prioritizing of rehabilitation and provision of services over mere economic \r\nbenefits; normalization of provision of services; and participation of users, \r\nand so forth - all are principles introduced or endorsed by the Disabled \r\nPersons\u0027 Social Integration Act, and are today key features of our daily \r\nendeavours. \r\nIn order to achieve the ultimate aim of integration, the Act proposes a \r\nstrategy based on four mutually supportive pillars that all underpin that \r\nultimate objective. These are prevention, rehabilitation, equalization of \r\nopportunity, and protection for disabled persons. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n127 \r\n(Mr. Castedo. Spain) \r\nPrevention is a right and duty of each and every citizen and society as a \r\nwhole. It is part of the priority obligations of the State in the realm of \r\npublic health and social services. Rehabilition is the central pillar of the \r\nentire strategy of the Act and the axis of the entire system, especially with \r\nrespect to measures of economic protection, employment promotion, and \r\nintegration into the workforce, which act as incentives for the whole \r\nprocess. Rehabilitation is regarded as the most powerful instrument for \r\nachieving integration, which, for the purposes of the Act, implies the \r\nfundamental integration into the workforce of disabled persons. \r\nFour major groups of rehabilitation programmes are currently under way in \r\nSpain: early care, aimed at children; educational integration for school-age \r\nchildren with special educational needs, aimed at integration into the \r\nordinary educational system; functional rehabilitation, where of particular \r\nnote is the growing use of technical aids in improving the physical autonomy \r\nof disabled persons; and, lastly, occupational rehabilitation, with the \r\nincreasing application of new technologies in the areas of training, of the \r\nadaption of workplaces, and of the design of ideal kinds of work for some \r\ndisabled persons. \r\nBy means of equalizing opportunities we aim at a series of environmental \r\nchanges that will foster integration, while we are mindful of the fact that \r\nthis is only possible if, at the same time, changes take place in our \r\nsocieties. The aim of these measures is to promote solidarity among citizens \r\nvis-a-vis those persons disadvantaged as a result of a disability. This \r\nsolidarity is manifested in the elimination of the obstacles of urban, legal, \r\nand socio-cultural life; in compensation for disadvantages in the fields of \r\nlegal adaptation, specific support services and additional economic \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n128 \r\n(Mr. Castedo. Spain) \r\nassistance; and in the promotion of the disabled community through \r\nparticipation, mutual assistance, and the formation of associations. \r\nOf particular importance is the establishment of mutual assistance \r\nnetworks and associations of disabled persons, and the growing participation \r\nof non-governmental organizations in setting up and administrating services to \r\nbenefit disabled persons. The role which non-governmental organizations play \r\nin achieving these objectives is critical and, although there has been \r\nconsiderable expansion in their activities in Spain in the last decade, there \r\nremains much to be done, particularly in terms of allowing them to share \r\nresponsibility with Government in developing positive action to facilitate \r\nfull integration. \r\nMeasures in the area of protection are aimed at achieving the final \r\nobjective of integration through increasingly higher standards of well-being \r\nfor disabled persons and, by extension, of the immediate community in which \r\nthey live. These include measures of economic protection, legal protection, \r\nand family protection. \r\nOverall economic, social and legal protection for disabled persons has \r\nbeen the most highly developed aspect of the Decade in our country. The \r\ntransition has been made from condescending protection grounded in the \r\ntradition of charity to protection of another kind based on the entitlement of \r\nindividuals. From a special system of protection, the community has joined \r\nthe State social security regime, which the Constitution recognizes as the \r\nright of all Spanish citizens. \r\nAware of the leading role of families in the protection and well-being of \r\ndisabled family members, and also of the fact that the welfare of one \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n129-130 \r\n(Mr. Castedo. Spain) \r\nindividual is hard to separate from the well-being of the family, the current \r\nprotection approach regards family protection as a key element. \r\nFamily protection includes meeting the needs that arise from the presence \r\nin the home of a disabled person. It consists basically of economic \r\nassistance that relieves the economic burden of an inactive and economically \r\ndependent family member or the added expenditure of meeting that person\u0027s \r\nspecific needs. It also consists of family support through information and \r\nadvisory services, as well as services involving temporary reception or the \r\nrelief - sometimes on a long-term basis of the family from the burden of \r\npermament care. In some cases, they may substitute on a temporary basis for \r\nthe caretakers in given families where there are serious problems. \r\nThese then are the major lines and principal measures promoted by the Act \r\nin the last decade in Spain. Over these past 10 years, the impact of the Act \r\nhas been assessed and reported upon by Congress, by the responsible \r\ndepartments, and by associations of the disabled. With differing emphasis, it \r\nhas generally been regarded by all as positive for the disabled community. \r\nThere are undoubtedly some gaps, but what has been appreciated above all is \r\nthe new impetus injected into activites carried out for the benefit of the \r\ncommunity as well as the overall vision of all the problems and possible \r\nsolutions. This is the first time that such an overall approach has been \r\ntaken in Spain. \r\nA/47/PV.? \r\n131 \r\nWe must look to the future. As other c \r\narticulate a new strategy for the 1990s. As \r\nlearn the lessons of the past decade. Abovt \r\nthat will take into account and attempt to i \r\naspirations of disabled persons. Those asp; \r\njustice and equal rights and opportunities i \r\nthe fullest potential. \r\nIn recognition of the specific nature c \r\nstrategy to the year 2000 will step up actii \r\nprevention, rehabilitation, equalization of \r\nlegal protection, taking into particular ac\u003c \r\nAs the coordinator of Government social \r\nl-he Ministry fnr Snrial Affairs is nrenarinf \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n132 \r\n(Mr. Castedo. Spain) \r\nFor the disabled person, this philosophy requires provision of the full \r\npotential of rehabilitation measures with a view to achieving full, productive \r\nparticipation and/or maximum financial self-sufficiency. Advances in human \r\nsciences and new technologies will make major contributions to achieving this \r\ngoal. \r\nFor society, promoting the independence of the disabled community is \r\nlinked to due integration of disabled persons into the workforce, the \r\nelimination of prejudice and incorrect attitudes that serve as cultural \r\nbarriers and lead to dependence and protectionism towards the disabled. We \r\nshall also focus on efforts to make communities more accessible and \r\nbarrier-free, with transportation and other services adapted to the needs of \r\nthe disabled, and with local authorities made sensitive to all the problems \r\nfacing disabled persons. \r\nIn short, our aim is the integration and active participation of these \r\ncitizens, but with a change in strategy: in the coming decade, we shall be \r\ntargeting society at large, not merely the disabled community, for integration , \r\ninvolves both. \r\nMr. AL-GHANEM (Saudi Arabia) (interpretation from Arabic): Please \r\nallow me to condole with the brotherly people of Egypt over the catastrophe of \u003e \r\nthe day before yesterday. We ask Almighty God to enable those who have lost \r\ntheir near and dear to bear the loss and we declare our solidarity with the , \r\nArab Republic of Egypt. \r\nI have been listening, since yesterday morning, to the statements of the ^ \r\ndistinguished delegates who have spoken on the problems of the disabled. I\" ^ \r\nall those statements these has been the unanimous call for serious work on \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n133-135 \r\n(Mr. Al-Ghanem. Saudi Arabia) \r\nbehalf of the disabled. However, all of this is repetitious; we, the \r\ndisabled, have been hearing this for over 20 years in conferences and meetings. \r\nI The General Assembly is right to mark the end of the Decade of Disabled \r\npersons. But what happens next? What happens after all the statements have \r\nbeen made? Have we satisfied ourselves and done our duty by the 500 million \r\ni disabled persons, 80 per cent of whom live in developing countries? Have we \r\nreally worked to eliminate the causes of disability? Have we worked to \r\n* prevent the disabilities caused by armed conflict, ignorance, disease and \r\nII poverty? The General Assembly is considering these questions for the first \r\ntime. \r\na I turn now to the problems of the disabled in my own country. In 1975 I \r\n± contacted the Minister for Education. At the time, it was \r\nKing Fahd bin Abdulaziz. He ordered the establishment of an institute for the \r\n;j blind. He set up a full budget for establishing institutions for the \r\n;1 disabled. A department within that Ministry of Education dealt with the \r\nI,; problems of the disabled, and institutes for the blind, the deaf and the \r\nmentally deficient were set up throughout the country. The Minister said, \"We \r\nj are going to help the disabled, because the disabled are human beings and \r\n( deserve civil rights; they deserve our assistance because of the laws and \r\n„ principles of Islam\". \r\n, For more than 30 years. King Fahd bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud has continued to \r\nsupport the disabled. He helped establish the regional office of the Middle \r\nEast Committee for Disabled Persons. The voice of the blind is now heard \r\nthroughout the world. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n136 \r\n(Mr. Al-Ghanem. Saudi Arahi.) \r\nI have given you this summary of what is happening in Saudi Arabia \r\nbecause I want to ask other Governments that have failed to show an interest \r\nin the disabled to learn a lesson from the actions of King Fahd and to follow \r\nhis example, one that could well be a model for the whole of mankind. \r\nWe in Saudi Arabia have participated in all the meetings and symposia \r\nheld in the course of the International Year of Disabled Persons and I have \r\nrepresented the Kingdom in every one of them. In 1982, King Fahd delegated me \r\nto discuss the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons. We have played a \r\nvery important role in discussing its recommendations and in the deliberations \r\nof the Decade. \r\nIn that context, we faced certain objections from some countries. It is \u0027 \r\nstrange indeed that those who opposed us in 1982 now support the Decade and \r\nits achievements and all that we did throughout the Decade. \r\nThe Decade has heightened awareness but, unfortunately, has had little \r\npractical result. We must be realistic: I have taken note of the \u0027 \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report (document A/47/415), which is very frank and very -. \r\nlucid. The report states the facts and crosses the t\u0027s. It speaks of \u0027 \r\nGovernments that have not formulated any policies and have not helped the \r\ndisabled. It also speaks of Governments that have announced the adoption of ; \r\npolicies but have never translated those declared intentions into facts. lil \r\nThese are all facts, and we must know them. It is high time we began truly to.;, \r\nwork on behalf of the disabled in deed and not in name. -•; \r\nDisability is linked to economic factors. If a country\u0027s economy ; \r\nimproves, its disabled citizens receive better care. These are facts. But do^ \r\nGovernments in the developing countries have sympathy for the disabled and ^ \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n137 \r\n(Mr. Al-Ghanem. Saudi Arabia) \r\nwant to help the disabled? Is there any acceptance of the fact that a \r\ndisabled person has the same rights vis-a-vis his community as the other, \r\nnormal, members of society? Is that really accepted by Governments? These \r\nare facts. \r\nAs I said yesterday, we are not here to solicit pity or ask for charity. \r\nWe are here to demand our legitimate rights, the rights due us in our \r\nsocieties and in our communities. A society\u0027s development can be measured by \r\nthe quality and type of treatment it provides for its disabled and by the way \r\nit deals with all social issues. \r\nThis is a human issue that has the status of a sacred message. We the \r\ndisabled have come here, for the first time, to address the General Assembly \r\nso that our voices may be heard all over the world. We are here to claim our \r\nrights. We want jobs. We want equality of employment. What does \"equality\" \r\nmean? Equality shall become a reality if a proper strategy to achieve it were \r\nformulated on the basis of carefully considered and properly weighed \r\nprinciples and on goodwill on the part of Governments. There are some \r\n180 million children who do not have enough food or drink. There are \r\n40 million children who face blindness and disability because of vitamin A \r\ndeficiency. These are facts. At the beginning of the Decade there were \r\n450 million disabled persons. Their numbers now have risen to 500 million and \r\nwill go on increasing unless the causes of disability are dealt with. I have \r\nnot heard one single speaker of the many who have spoken since yesterday speak \r\nof the causes of disability or of the prevention of disability. \r\nNinety-nine per cent of the disabilities caused by accidents, if treated in \r\ntimely fashion, can be prevented. We must stress these facts and never lose \r\nsight of these realities. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n138 \r\n(Mr. Al-Ghanem. Saudi Ar?hig) \r\nI want every person in this hall to bear in mind that the disabled have \r\nthe same rights in society and that if they are given the proper chance \r\nthrough access to modern technology, they can be of great benefit to society. \r\nThat door must be opened to them. \r\nMr. VASILYEV (Belarus)(interpretation from Russian): The delegation \r\nof the Republic of Belarus attaches great importance to the assessment of the \r\nresults of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons and to the \r\nformulation of the programme of action for the future. We welcome the \r\nspecific recommendations contained in the Secretary-General\u0027s report \r\n(A/47/415) on moving, in the context of the United Nations programme on \r\ndisability, from measures for disseminating information and \r\nconsciousness-raising to practical action. In that connection, I should like \r\nto point out that many of the measures suggested in the report are already \r\nbeing implemented in Belarus and are being made part of our national State \r\npolicy for the disabled. \r\nUnfortunately, owing to the complicated economic, social and \r\nenvironmental situation in our country, the number of disabled persons is \r\nincreasing faster than the number of workers. As of January 1991 more than \r\n348,000 disabled persons, amounting to about 3.4 per cent of the total \r\npopulation, were registered with social-welfare organs. In the past five \r\nyears that number has risen by 32,300 persons, that is, by 10 per cent. \r\nIn the Republic of Belarus we are now establishing a fairly strong legal \r\nbasis for resolving problems connected with improving the status of disabled \r\npersons. Legislative action to deal with the problems of disability is being \r\ntaken in two main areas: first, the adoption of special comprehensive laws \r\nand, secondly, consideration given to the needs of the disabled in laws \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n139-140 \r\n(Mr. Vasilyev. Belarus) \r\ncovering specific questions, including those relating to industry; examples \r\nare the laws of Belarus on employment and on pensions and special provisions \r\nof tax legislation. \r\nPursuant to a recommendation contained in the World Programme of Action \r\nconcerning Disabled Persons, on 11 November 1991 the Supreme Soviet adopted a \r\ncomprehensive Act on the Social Defence of Disabled Persons in the Republic of \r\nBelarus. The Act establishes the main lines of national State policy with \r\nregard to the disabled and seeks to implement effective measures for \r\ndisability prevention, the rehabilitation of disabled persons, guarantees of \r\nequality and equal participation by the disabled in society. Social policies \r\nfor the disabled have heretofore been based on providing material \r\ncompensation. They disregarded the disabled person\u0027s remaining opportunities \r\nand capacity for work. That approach was not conducive to the full \r\nintegration of the disabled into society. The new Act requires the State \r\norgans of the Republic of Belarus to provide an education, vocational training \r\nand job placement for the disabled. The Act is based on the universal \r\nrecognition of the human rights of disabled persons, who are, first and \r\nforemost, citizens of the Republic of Belarus, with rights and duties equal to \r\nthose of other citizens, and are only secondarily beneficiaries of social \r\nservices. \r\nAccording to the Act, disabled persons enjoy all the socio-economic and \r\npersonal rights and freedoms enshrined in the Declaration on the Rights of \r\nDisabled Persons adopted by the General Assembly, in the Constitution of \r\nBelarus and in other legislation. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n141 \r\n(Mr. Vasilvev. Belarys) \r\nDisabled persons have an inalienable right to respect for their human \r\ndignity. Discrimination against the disabled is prohibited and prosecutable. \r\nThe draft new constitution of Belarus establishes the right of its citizens to \r\ndisability benefits. \r\nThe task of the interdepartmental council being established in Belarus \r\nfor dealing with the problems of the disabled is to ensure proper coordination \r\nof national policies for improving the status of disabled persons and to work \r\nout concerted action aimed at implementing the provisions of the Act. That is \r\nalso the goal of the Republic\u0027s comprehensive programme, now in preparation, \r\non the problems of disability for the years 1994 to 2000. It envisages three \r\nmain areas: prevention, rehabilitation and equalization of opportunity. \r\nIn the Republic of Belarus, disabled persons participate, as members of -\r\nthe Supreme Soviet, in the process of elaborating and adopting laws relating \r\nto the disabled and, as civil servants, in the procedure for implementing \r\nthose laws. Moreover, disabled persons in our country are also active in \r\nnon-governmental organizations. A new public organization, the Belarus i. \r\nAssociation of Disabled Persons, was recently admitted to the International ; \r\nFederation of Disabled Persons. A charity and health fund has been a \r\nestablished. Associations of the blind and the deaf are currently active. \r\nBut because of our difficult economic situation, Belarus organizations of ; \r\ndisabled persons are in urgent need of external financial and material \r\nassistance and consultative services on questions of disability at both State ̂  \r\nand non-governmental levels. ;[. \r\nThe report of the Secretary-General addresses the results of the work of ̂  \r\nthe regional commissions in identifying common causes of disability throughout \r\nthe world, which include poverty, disease, armed conflict, accidents and „ \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n142 \r\n(Mr. Vasilvev. Belarus) \r\nageing. We believe that another important factor should be added to this \r\nlist: the environmental one. For Belarus, this means the concrete problem of \r\neliminating the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear-power-station accident, \r\nwhich has affected one of every five citizens of Belarus. There has been a \r\ndramatic 60 per cent increase in oncological disease, particularly thyroid \r\ncancer among children. More than half of all school-age children exposed to \r\nradioactive contamination have been found to suffer from disorders of the \r\ncardiovascular system. It is thus quite understandable that in our \r\nlegislation the concept of disability prevention includes measures to ensure \r\nenvironmental safety. For that reason, we believe that the work of the United \r\nNations to improve the status of disabled persons should be closely \r\ncoordinated with the actions of the international community to implement the \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions on strengthening international cooperation and \r\ncoordinating efforts to study, mitigate and minimize the effects of the \r\nChernobyl accident. \r\nWe should like to mention a number of points that, in our view, will \r\nfacilitate a more successful solution of the problems confronting the \r\ninternational community with regard to the prevention of disability, the \r\nrehabilitation of disabled persons and the equalization of opportunity. In \r\nparticular, we wish to draw attention to the following priority measures: \r\nimproved coordination of activities; finalization of a long-term strategy to \r\nthe year 2000 and beyond to provide assistance to the decision-making bodies \r\nof the United Nations system in taking action to improve the status of the \r\ndisabled; publication of the text of standard norms for guaranteeing equal \r\nopportunity for disabled persons; provision of highly effective information at \r\nthe national and regional levels in important areas of policy concerning the \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n143 \r\n(Mr. Vasilyev. Belarus) \r\ndisabled; expansion of the range of topics for scientific and applied \r\nresearch, with mandatory participation by associations of disabled persons; \r\nenhancement of the role of organizations of the disabled in the \r\ndecision-making process at the national and international levels; and \r\nincreased participation by disabled women, who are often the victims of sex \r\ndiscrimination. \r\nThe basic element of the World Programme of Action is, we believe, its \r\nrecognition of the human rights of the disabled. Accordingly, it would be a \r\ngood idea to consider at the World Conference on Human Rights, the question of \r\nthe human rights of the disabled. We also support the initiative of the \r\nSpecial Representative of the United Nations to establish an international \r\nfund and an international centre for the disabled, which we consider important \r\nfor a more effective coordination of activities in the interests of the \r\ndisabled throughout the world. \r\nIn conclusion, our delegation wishes to declare its full support for the \r\ndraft resolution contained in document A/47/L.4. \r\nMr. MAYORGA CORTES (Nicaragua) (interpretation from Spanish): At \r\nthe outset, we wish to thank Minister Robert de Cotret of Canada for his \r\nstatement yesterday in which he summarized the principal results of the \r\nMinisterial Meeting held in Montreal on 8 and 9 October. The interest \r\nmanifested in this meeting by the large number of attending Ministers, the \r\nfrankness of the exchange of views, and the decision to establish a \r\nMinisterial Working Group to follow up on the issue now before us highlight \r\nthe importance of again placing the issue of national and international action \r\nto benefit the disabled at the top of our agenda. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n144 \r\n(Mr. Mayorga Cortes. Nicaragua) \r\nOne of the major conclusions of the Secretary-General\u0027s report on this \r\nissue is that it will not be possible to achieve the objectives of the World \r\nProgramme of Action concerning the Disabled without increasing the resources \r\navailable for international cooperation, whether bilateral or multilateral, \r\nbeyond existing levels. Speaking realistically, the Secretary-General also \r\nnotes that, in the face of the slow progress of activities in the area of \r\nprevention and rehabilitation of the disabled as well as of equalization of \r\nopportunity, there is the danger that, if the current worsening trends in the \r\neconomic and social situation of the developing countries persist, the \r\ndisabled may find themselves even more marginalized in society if no special \r\nassistance is given to them. \r\nThe lack of resources is consequently a serious limiting factor. \r\nHowever, in our view, of equal importance is the conviction and determination \r\nof our own countries about the need to devise timely and effective measures in \r\nterms of policy, programmes, and services for the disabled, especially in the \r\nareas of special education, employment, social services, urban planning, \r\nsocial security, taxation policies, transport, and culture and sport. \r\nIn this respect, we wish to stress at the outset the critical role that \r\nthe political will of States is playing and the complementary importance of \r\nbolstering the functions of prevention, coordination, supervision, training, \r\nand information exchange, which are the responsibilities of the United \r\nNations. In short, better and more effective national and international \r\norganization is now required if we are to move on from consciousness-raising \r\nto action. However, it must be recognized that the process of awareness and \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n145 \r\n(Mr. Mavoroa Cortes. Hicar8«j...) \r\nconsciousness-raising in our societies also needs to be further stepped up, \r\nabandoning paternalistic approaches that underestimate the true potential and \r\ncapacities of the disabled in all aspects of life or which fail to recognize \r\nthe central role that they themselves should be playing as actors in the \r\nprocess of fundamentally changing attitudes in our societies. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n146 \r\n(Mr. Mayorga Cortes. Nicaragua) \r\nAs many speakers have already said, developing countries must make great \r\nadvances in the socio-economic sphere, especially in combating poverty, in \r\norder to be in a better position to accelerate their activities for the \r\ndisabled. But this should not be an excuse for us to shirk our \r\nresponsibilities in this area or delay shouldering them. In fact, we cannot \r\nbe either complacent or frustrated. We must pool all our capacity for action, \r\nand on an urgent basis. I stress this urgency. \r\nWe agree with Mr. Malinga of Disabled Peoples International, who said \r\nyesterday that the liberation of the disabled can come about only through \r\ntheir own organizations and their own efforts, and that disability is a valid \r\nissue of human rights of citizens in the full meaning of the term citizens, \r\nnot clients of particular social-service agencies. Mr. Malinga also noted \r\nthat so long as our societies remain hostile and inaccessible to the problems \r\nof the disabled, and so long as the disabled feel marginalized, oppressed, \r\ndiscriminated against or exploited, they have the primary responsibility to \r\norganize themselves to remove the social, architectural, cultural, \r\nenvironmental and attitudinal barriers that impede them. They are not \r\nfighting for privileges; they are fighting to enjoy the same rights as other \r\nmembers of society. Listening to Mr. Malinga, one reaches the conclusion that \r\nit is not really the disabled who require rehabilitation, but our societies. \r\nThese also need to be made healthy - not necessarily physically, but \r\nspiritually and psychologically, which is often as important as or more \r\nimportant than the first. Public and private agencies working in this field \r\nshould review their approaches and procedures, update their working methods, \r\ntarget their programmes and give priority and urgency to their activities. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n147 \r\n(Mr. Mayorga Cortes. Ninara^a \r\nFor all those reasons, we firmly support Mr. Malinga\u0027s seven proposals \r\naimed at surmounting the main conceptual and institutional obstacles to truly \r\ntimely and effective national and international action. \r\nIn the United Nations context, we stress the importance of the following \r\nelements of action for the period 1993 to 2002: \r\nFirst, in order to support appropriately the implementation of the World \r\nProgramme of Action, the long-term strategy and the standard rules on the \r\nequalization of opportunities, we must devise and put into effect an \r\nintegrated, coordinated approach by the United Nations Children\u0027s Fund, the \r\nWorld Health Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and \r\nCultural Organization, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nRefugees, the United Nations Development Programme, the International Labour \r\nOrganisation and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \r\nSecond, it is necessary to strengthen the Office of the Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for the Promotion of the United \r\nNations Decade of Disabled Persons and heed the proposal of the World \r\nCommittee for the Decade that we establish an agency or organization endowed \r\nwith the human and financial resources it needs to do its in for the coming \r\ndecade. We also support the suggestion of the Chairman of that Committee, \r\nMr. Alan Reich, that pending the establishment of such machinery the \r\nSecretary-General should constantly exercise his moral leadership with a view \r\nto inspiring further action by Heads of State or Government in this area. \r\nThird, it is necessary to step up the work of the regional economic and \r\nsocial Commissions in preparing plans of action for the various parts of the \r\nworld, including the proclamation of regional decades like the one declared in \r\nthe region of Asia and the Pacific. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n148 \r\n(Mr. Mayorga Cortes. Nicaragua) \r\nFourth, it is vitally important to bolster and enhance the effectiveness \r\nof interinstitutional and consultative machinery among United Nations bodies \r\nand between them and the non-governmental organizations. International \r\nnon-governmental organizations are legitimate and crucial partners in the vast \r\ntasks ahead of us, and their active participation should be encouraged. \r\nFifth, the following must be of high priority: special education for \r\ndisabled persons; the development and execution of programmes for the training \r\nof trainers; and the specific needs of children, women and the elderly. \r\nSixth, the Centre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs at the \r\nUnited Nations Office at Vienna should be strengthened, so it can, inter alia. \r\ngive due support to organizing national coordinating committees and other \r\n- organs, and to their work. \r\nSeventh, recognizing the work of the former Department of Technical \r\nCooperation for Development in helping countries formulate and carry out \r\n\" programmes for the disabled, we encourage the new Under-Secretary-General for \r\nEconomic and Social Development to intensify the work of the support group set \r\nit up in line with resolution 45/91 and, in general, to maintain an active \r\n:\u003e presence vis-a-vis the question of the disabled. \r\n.; Eighth, we firmly support the continuation beyond the Decade of the \r\nVoluntary Fund for the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons. We agree \r\n•; with the Secretary-General that the Fund has been of direct benefit to \r\n,. grass-roots initiatives and that it has made a significant contribution to \r\n:\u003e United Nations activities for the disabled. In that context, we also view as \r\nil timely the Secretary-General\u0027 s proposal to give a new mandate to the Fund; \r\n;. this should be considered by the Economic and Social Council. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n149-150 \r\n(Mr. Mayorga Cortes. Nicaragua) \r\nNinth, we support China\u0027s proposal that the question of the disabled \r\nshould appear on the agenda of the summit on social development to be held in \r\n1995. This should not preclude the convening of a United Nations world \r\nconference on this subject in the next two or three years, as suggested by the \r\nWorld Committee chaired by Mr. Reich. The item, of course, is mandatory for \r\nthe coming world conferences on human rights and on women. \r\nWithout diminishing the importance of integrated rehabilitation and equal \r\nopportunities, I want to stress the overriding importance for developing \r\ncountries of the adoption of measures to prevent disabilities and eliminate \r\nthose that can be treated at low cost. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n151 \r\n(Mr. Mayorga Cortes. Nicaragua) \r\nIn the first case, in accordance with the second Leeds Castle Declaration \r\nof 1991, it is estimated that with appropriate action it would be possible to \r\nprevent some 30 million human beings from becoming disabled in the decade \r\n1993-2002 and that close to 70 million might be able to surmount their \r\ni disabilities by means of relatively low-cost medical intervention. Can the \r\nworld possibly remain impassive in the light of those statistics and their \r\ne promise for the future? There is no doubt that this field of action is a \r\npriority, and we must pool our efforts to address it. \r\ns Taking into account the fact that disease and war are significant causes \r\nof disability in developing countries, we should like to note that in the \r\nformer case, disease, much can be done to coordinate ongoing scientific \r\nresearch in the developed countries, as well as to share that research between \r\ndeveloped and developing countries. The exchange of experience is still \r\nextremely limited, and there is a need to identify and target priority areas \r\nthat have proved promising for research. There has been insufficient \r\ncross-referencing of the results of research being done in the areas of \r\ngenetics, organ transplants, the impact of environmental degradation on health \r\nand the quest for solutions to the terrible tragedy of AIDS, as well as with \r\nregard to other scientific investigations into such diseases as arthritis, \r\nmultiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy, to mention only a few of the diseases \r\nthat continue to resist science. The timely and widespread dissemination of \r\nthe results of such research and the systematic exchange of scientific \r\ninformation should be key components of the international action to be \r\nundertaken in the decade 1993-2002. \r\nNicaragua has experienced the evils of war at first hand, and we continue \r\nto confront its aftermaths. One of the most significant results has, of \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n152 \r\n(Mr. Mayorga Cortes. Nicaragua \r\ncourse, been the number of disabled persons as a result of the conflict, a \r\nnumber estimated at approximately 16,000, most of whom are young people, \r\nchildren and women. Their present and future status is of extreme concern to \r\nmy Government. \r\nNicaragua is a country with a disability incidence that is much higher \r\nthan the average in other developing countries. It is estimated that \r\napproximately 10 per cent of our population is affected by some form of \r\ndisability. Given the inaccuracy of available statistics and the problems \r\ncreated by the aftermath of war, we are certain that that figure is a \r\nsignificant underestimation of the true state of affairs. Together with the \r\nproblems generated by poverty, malnutrition, accidents, diseases and other \r\ncauses, in Nicaragua war as I have already noted has left a painful legacy \r\nof disability. The war-disabled are being given priority by the Government, \r\nbut we should like to work out an overall approach to the problem. \r\nThe World Health Organization estimates that of the 390,000 disabled \r\npersons in Nicaragua, the majority of whom are women, 84 per cent have \r\nphysical or motor-related limitations, 8 per cent suffer from mental illness, \r\n4 per cent suffer from sensory deprivation and an another 4 per cent suffer \r\nfrom neurological disabilities or a work-related disability. Many of the \r\ndisabled are also victims of drug addiction, which makes the situation even \r\nmore complex. \r\nArticle 62 of the Republic\u0027s Constitution establishes that: \r\n\"The State shall strive to establish programmes to benefit disabled \r\npersons leading to thoir physical, psychological and social \r\nrehabilitation and their reintegration into the workforce.\" \r\nThe principal body responsible for preparing and executing such programmes is \r\nthe Nicaraguan Institute of Social Security and Wellbeing, which has \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n153 \r\n(Mr. Mayorga Cortes. Nicaragua) \r\nundertaken a wide range of income- and/or employment-generating activities for \r\ndisabled persons and which, in coordination with the Nicaraguan National \r\nCommission for Rehabilitation, has carried out restricted training programmes \r\nthrough a number of occupational workshops. None the less, there is a need to \r\nexpand such activities and promote more permament institutional frameworks. \r\nIn February of this year two institutes providing care for the 97,000 \r\ndirect victims of the war including the 16,000 persons disabled as a result \r\nof that tragedy - were merged. The National Commission for Support to \r\nVeterans and the Nicaraguan Repatriation Institute ceased to exist and were \r\ncombined under the Nicaraguan Institute of Social Security and Wellbeing as \r\nthe Department for Care for War Victims. \r\nOn 14 February of this year the First National Meeting of War Disabled \r\nfor Peace, Reconciliation and Development was held. On that occasion the \r\nGovernment made specific proposals in the areas of employment, education, \r\nhealth and well-being, transport, culture and sport. The proposals were \r\ndebated at some length by the competent bodies, both public and private. For \r\ntheir part, the participants made their own suggestions and proposals on such \r\nsubjects as the allocation of appropriate financial resources for more \r\neffective action, vocational training, housing, participation in the process \r\nof privatization being undertaken in the country, taxation policy, urban \r\ntransport, employment of women disabled as a result of the war, recreation, \r\nspecial education and the strengthening of the National Health System to \r\nbenefit the disabled. The results of the Meeting have helped to clarify the \r\npolicies and action of the Government in this area. However, all of this \r\nmust be tackled within very tight financial constraints. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n154-155 \r\n(Mr. Mayorga Cortes. Nicaragua) \r\nAlso in February of this year the Government of Nicaragua, under the \r\nterms of Decree No. 7-92, set up the Institute for Care to War Victims \r\n(INVICTA), within the purview of the Programme for National Reconciliation and \r\nRehabilitation, the keystone of President Chamorro\u0027s governmental programme. \r\nThe Institute functions as a department of the Ministry of the Presidency. \r\nINVICTA is an initiative designed to foster widespread cooperation and \r\nunderstanding among disabled veterans of the resistance and the military, who \r\nin the past decade waged a devastating war in Nicaragua. Its creation is \r\nvaluable testimony to the process of healing and growing domestic solidarity \r\nthat is ongoing in Nicaragua, notwithstanding the difficulties still facing \r\nus. Recently, to carry out the Institute\u0027s various activities a project with \r\nspecific sub-projects was drawn up and budgeted at $11.9 million, and this \r\nhas been submitted to the international community for consideration. \r\nTimely and proper attention to the needs of the disabled is of critical \r\nimportance in Nicaragua, as it is in all the developing countries. After all, \r\n85 per cent of the world\u0027s 500 million disabled live in those countries. We \r\nare confident that our countries, the United Nations and the private sector \r\ncan work together to build upon and expand the action initiated during the \r\nDecade to which we are now bidding farewell. However, we must not lose sight \r\nof the sense of urgency, the need for creativity, the new requirements in \r\nterms of organization and greater participation by the disabled themselves, \r\nall factors that are more and acute and pressing today than ever before. If \r\nwe bear those factors in mind as we approach our work, our endeavours will \r\nundoubtedly be successful. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n156 \r\nMr. GHAFOORZAI (Afghanistan): At the outset, I should like to \r\nexpress my delegation\u0027s deepest sympathy and condolences to the delegation of \r\nthe Arab Republic of Egypt and, through it, to the people and the Government \r\nof Egypt, on the loss of life and destruction of property Egypt has suffered \r\ni \r\nas a result of the devastating earthquake that struck Cairo. \r\nWhile we are marking the conclusion of the United Nations Decade of \r\nDisabled Persons and evaluating its achievements, the number of persons with \r\ndisability has increased over the course of the Decade, especially in \r\nwar-stricken countries such as Afghanistan. We believe, as is also reflected \r\nin the report of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros \r\nBoutros-Ghali, in document A/47/415, that disability remains a great challenge \r\nthat must be addressed seriously. \r\nt \r\nMy delegation has studied with great interest the report of the \r\nSecretary-General and congratulates His Excellency on the important \r\n[ft \r\ncontribution of the United Nations to the achievements of the Decade of \r\nUs \r\nDisabled Persons. I would a l so l i k e to express my de legat ion\u0027s thanks and \r\nii» \r\ngratitude to all the international, governmental and non-governmental bodies \r\nfor their valuable work carried out during the Decade. \r\nThis occasion gives the delegation of the Islamic State of Afghanistan a \r\ngood opportunity to bring to the attention of the international community the \r\n*\"\" gravity of the disabilities facing Afghan society. General Assembly \r\nirresolution 45/91 of 14 December 1990, through which the General Assembly \r\nfc1\"1 requested the Secretary-General to shift the focus of the United Nations \r\nDili\u0027Programme on disability from that of awareness-raising to action, has immense \r\nimportance for the Islamic State of Afghanistan. Afghanistan, a war-stricken \r\ncountry, has inherited more than 2 million disabled persons I repeat, 2 \r\nmillion disabled persons - as a legacy of aggression and an imposed 14-year \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n157 \r\n(Mr. Ghafoorzai. Afghani st-an) \r\nwar. Disability, in the magnitude that exists in Afghanistan, literally \r\ndisables the entire nation. Our need is urgent and our appeal is for quick \r\naction. The extent of the devastation that Afghanistan has suffered is best \r\nportrayed in a paragraph from the recent \"Consolidated Appeal by His \r\nExcellency the Secretary-General of the United Nations for Emergency \r\nHumanitarian Assistance for Afghanistan\", as follows: \r\n\"Few countries in history have suffered to the extent Afghanistan has \r\nover the past 14 years. Aside from the physical destruction, which was \r\noften nothing short of cataclysmic, the results of the war include over a \r\nmillion people killed, over 2 million disabled, nearly 6 million refugees \r\nin neighbouring countries, and 2 million internally displaced persons.\" \r\nUnfortunately, the disabled population of Afghanistan is not decreasing, \r\nbut owing to the indiscriminate mining of the entire country with over \r\n10 million mines, the toll is increasing at an ominously high rate. The \r\nrefugees returning home after 14 years of hardship are often greeted by land \r\nmines, which most often maim them and force their return to the overcrowded \r\nborder medical facilities. \r\nIndeed, it is ironic that the international community is celebrating the \r\nend of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons while in my country, the \r\nproblem facing Afghan society of more than 2 million disabled persons the \r\nhighest number in a single country is an acute national disaster. I believe \r\nthat this problem in Afghanistan is closely linked to the overall strategy of \u003ei \r\neconomic and social rehabilitation of the country. Therefore, we earnestly \r\ncall upon the Centre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs at the \r\nUnited Nations Office at Vienna and other international bodies to extend \r\ntechnical assistance to the Government of Afghanistan in preparing a report on \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n158-160 \r\n(Mr. Ghafoorzai. Afghanistan) \r\nthe extent of disability in our country, which could serve as a solid \r\nfoundation for future programmes for the rehabilitation of the Afghan disabled \r\npopulation and its integration into the active workforce and the \r\nreconstruction of the country. \r\nProviding the multitude of disabled persons in Afghanistan with an \r\nopportunity to become as self-sufficient as possible is imperative for the \r\nrealization of a successful programme for the self-sufficiency of the disabled \r\npopulation, allowing the remaining segments of the workforce to concentrate on \r\nthe rebuilding projects. To reach that level of self-sufficiency, it is \r\nnecessary to include in the programme for disabled persons primary health \r\ncare, nutrition, immunization, and other preventive measures, as well as \r\nrehabilitation programmes, technical aid and appliances, education facilities, \r\nand vocational training. \r\nAfghanistan\u0027s disabled population cannot expect any equality of \r\nopportunity when the vast majority of medical facilities in the country is \r\neither completely inactive or functioning with less than adequate resources. \r\nThe expected increase in the number of disabled in Afghanistan is due not only \r\nto lack of proper medical facilities and medicine which could prevent a \r\ndisease from becoming incapacitating, but also to such deprivations as \r\nmalnutrition, especially a.nong children, and lack of clean drinking water \r\nowing to the destruction of drinking-water facilities and the pollution of \r\n\"ater supplies as a result of 14 years of war. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n161 \r\n(Mr. Ghafoorzai. Afghanisr»„) \r\nAs the Foreign Minister of the Islamic State of Afghanistan pointed out \r\nin his 30 September 1992 statement to the General Assembly, with its multitude \r\nof problems and its limited capabilities Afghanistan cannot alone address the \r\ncritical needs of disabled persons. He stressed the priority of constructing \r\nnew hospitals and clinics as a prerequisite for the initiation of \r\nrehabilitation programmes for disabled persons. The Foreign Minister added \r\nthat all rehabilitation programmes need to be financed with international \r\nassistance. \r\nWhile praising the efforts of the United Nations Office at Vienna and the \r\nCentre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs in adopting principles \r\naimed at ensuring the implementation of measures and a monitoring system for \r\nthe rights of disabled persons, I should mention that the problem in \r\nAfghanistan is of a different nature. Our country needs to create appropriate \r\nnational machinery to support almost 2 million persons disabled as a result of; \r\narmed conflict. Without appropriate international assistance, this objective \r\ncannot be achieved. \r\nMy delegation, aware of the seriousness of problems related to disability, \r\nand the important tasks ahead in this respect, supports the conclusions and \r\nrecommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General and welcomes \r\nthe note by the Secretary-General (A/47/214) calling for continuation of the , \r\nVoluntary Fund for the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons. \r\nOn the regional level, recently the Economic and Social Commission for ^ \r\nAsia and the Pacific (ESCAP) proclaimed the Asian and Pacific Decade of ;a \r\nDisabled Persons, 1993-2002, which deserves our appreciation. \u003e, \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n162 \r\n(Mr. Ghafoorzai. Afghanistan) \r\nAlso, the World Committee for the United Nations Decade of Disabled \r\nPersons deserves our appreciation for calling on the United Nations to convene \r\na United Nations world conference on disability by 1995 and establish a United \r\nNations disability agency sufficient to meet the enormous challenge of \r\nimplementing the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons; \r\nmoreover, until such a United Nations agency is established, the \r\nSecretary-General should, on a continuing basis, assert his moral authority to \r\ninspire Heads of State and other world leaders to turn from \"awareness-raising \r\nto action\". \r\nI would also like to congratulate the ad-hoc working group to establish \r\nstandard rules on the equalization of opportunities for disabled persons on \r\nfulfilling its mandate. \r\nIt is hoped that the draft rules on equalization of opportunities \r\nrecently approved by the ad hoc working group will be completed and submitted \r\nto the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly for adoption. \r\nIn conclusion, we believe that, despite the rich experience and the gains \r\nof the Decade, disability remains a serious challenge which requires \r\ncomprehensive and more action-oriented programmes and strong commitment by \r\nMember States and concerned international bodies to the implementation of the \r\nWorld Programme of Action beyond the United Nations Decade of Disabled \r\nPersons. Afghanistan is a prime candidate for such action-oriented \r\nprogrammes, and we hope that, given the magnitude of the problem of the \r\ndisabled in Afghanistan, we will be placed on the priority list of the \r\nProgramme concerning disabled persons for the period 1993 to 2002. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n163 \r\nMr. KHALIL (Syrian Arab Republic) (interpretation from Arabic): I \r\nwish to condole with to the people of Egypt with respect to the major \r\nearthquake that has struck their capital city, Cairo, and extend to them my \r\ncountry\u0027s sympathy and solidarity. \r\nIt is a great honour and privilege for me to represent the Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic before this Assembly, on which millions of disabled persons have \r\npinned their hopes of equality with others seeking employment opportunities \r\nthat would ensure for them self-reliance, independence and dignity in \r\ncommunities that really care for them and address their problems. The \r\ndisabled will continue to be a wasted human resource, unless society cares for \r\nthem, rehabilitates them and integrates them into its mainstream of life. \r\nIn that context, I want to pay tribute to the Canadian Government and its \r\nMinister responsible for the disabled in preparing for the international \r\nconference on the disabled that was held at Montreal on 8 and 9 October this \r\nyear. The Conference\u0027s conclusions and recommendations outline international \r\nmachinery for financing and for exchanges of information and technology \r\nthrough the United Nations. \r\nWhen the General Assembly declared 1981 the International Year of the \r\nDisabled, there were 450 million disabled persons in the world. Ten years \r\nlater, that number has risen to 500 million. This makes it necessary for \r\nsociety to pay greater attention to the disabled and motivate public opinion \r\nto support the disabled and deal with their problems in a manner that would \r\nhave a positive impact on their present and future lives through a determined \r\neffort to find the reasons behind the increase in the numbers of the disabled \r\nand to deal with the causes of that increase. \r\nWhen the General Assembly declared 1981 the International Year of \r\nDisabled Persons, its aim was to heighten public awareness of this problem and \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n164-165 \r\n(Mr. Khalil. Syrian Arab Republic) \r\nirge the competent authorities to do more in the field of rehabilitation and \r\n:he prevention of disabilities, all under the banner of \"Full participation \r\nand equality\". \r\nCooperation, fraternity, a sense of responsibility to defend the rights \r\nof others are incumbent upon us all, and not for reasons of pity or charity. \r\nThe goal of these meetings, as outlined in the documents before us, is to \r\ndiscuss the present conditions of the disabled, review what has been done for \r\nthem in the framework of the Decade and explore the possibilities of \r\nestablishing a world plan of action to provide care for the disabled, \r\nrehabilitation and equality with others in employment opportunities. As we \r\nstand on the threshold of a new world decade of the disabled the objective \r\nshould be to define clearly rights and obligations. The person with a mental \r\nor physical disability is, before all, a citizen of a democratic society that \r\nrespects all social and human values and provides equal opportunities to all \r\nits members, as a right, not out of motives of charity. Disabled persons \r\nshould participate in the planning and follow-up of programmes that concern \r\nthem. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n166 \r\n(Mr. Khalil. Syrian Arab Repnhn,.) \r\nHere, it might be in order to point out that the number of disabled \r\npersons in our country is 1,129, 30 per cent of whom are of school age. That \u0027 \r\nnumber represents 1.076 per cent of the total population of Syria. \r\nFor 20 years my country, inspired by the wise guidance of J \r\nPresident Hafiz Al Assad, has taken action to arrive at effective solutions to\" \r\nthe problems of disabled persons within the limitations fixed by our national :: \r\nresources. Fourteen institutes for the disabled have been set up in all \r\nprovinces under the supervision of the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, \" \r\nfour for teaching the deaf, two for teaching the blind, two for the physically\"\u0027 \r\nhandicapped, one vocational training centre for the handicapped, four for the \"\u0027-• \r\nmentally retarded and one for paralyzed children. In addition, two more \r\nschools for the mentally retarded will be opened this year. Five day-schools \u003ei \r\nfor the same category and a further vocational training centre are in the i \r\npipeline. We hope to be able, in the near future, to increase the number of \u003e \r\ninstitutions for the mentally retarded and physically handicapped so as to , \r\ncover all the provinces and meet all existing needs within our limited , \r\nresources. . \r\nAs for job opportunities for the disabled, our labour laws stipulate tha , \r\nthe disabled should represent 2 per cent of the total labour force in the \r\nprivate sector and 4 per cent in the public sector. The Ministry of Social \r\nand Labour Affairs has submitted a draft law to the competent authorities \r\ncalling for an increase in that proportion to 6 per cent of the total labour \r\nforce. \r\nI hope that all the United Nations will undertake all practical follow-u] \r\nmeasures with regard to the care, rehabilitation and training of the disabled \r\nthroughout the world and that serious and construction action will be taken ti \r\nreduce the causes of disability. In addition, we must ensure the financial \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n167 \r\n(Mr. Khalil. Syrian Arab Republic) \r\nand technological resources necessary and bring about an exchange of \r\ninformation through working groups. \r\nIn conclusion, I should like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for \r\nhis report (A/47/415) on the implementation of the World Programme of Action \r\nconcerning Disabled Persons and the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons, \r\nand to the important conclusions and recommendations therein. \r\nMr. ARAOZ (Argentina)(interpretation from Spanish): It is with \r\ngreat pleasure that I take part in this debate marking the conclusion of the \r\nUnited Nations Decade of Disabled Persons and express the recognition of the \r\nArgentine Republic and its appreciation to all the institutions and officials, \r\nand to the international community as represented here, for the concern shown \r\nin favour of the disabled throughout the world. \r\nI wish to acknowledge in particular the appropriate initiative of the \r\nGovernment of Canada in convening the earlier meeting of responsible ministers \r\nin this area, which was held at Montreal and which provided an opportunity for \r\ndirect communication among those in charge of ensuring prevention, \r\nrehabilitation and equality of opportunities for the disabled in all \r\ncountries. To that earlier commitment we add today in the General Assembly \r\nthe firm resolve of my country to continue its participation in such meetings \r\nin order to make progress at the multilateral level towards increasingly \r\neffective solutions to the problems that bring us together here today. \r\nThroughout the debate it has been clear that there is a close link \r\nbetween disability and social policies that respond to the tragedy of poverty, \r\ninequality and the lack of a minimum standard for a decent life. That is why \r\nI want to emphasize that all efforts specifically designed to help the \r\ndisabled must be made within the framework of what each country and the \r\ninternational community as a whole are doing to achieve a more just and. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n168 \r\n(Mr. Araoz. Argentina) \r\ntherefore, more humane, society. Perhaps the convening of a world summit on \r\nsocial development, which my country fully endorses, is the best means of \r\nfinding solutions for the disabled - and that would be one of the various \r\nproblems to be addressed at such a meeting and it would be a sign that all \r\npeoples were to be involved. All the disabled will obtain full equality of \r\nopportunities when the population of a given society as a whole has access to \r\na dignified lifestyle, to employment, to education, to health care and to full \r\nrespect for human rights in a word, to the individual\u0027s greatest possible \r\nfulfilment within an organized community. \r\nThose aspirations will become realities only if every initiative is \r\naction-oriented and does not remain mere verbiage contained in compilations of \r\ninternational instruments. During the Decade now drawing to a close Argentina \r\nhas made efforts to discharge its responsibility by taking realistic and \r\neffective steps in that direction. As evidence of such compliance we will \r\ndeposit with the Secretariat the legal body of laws, decrees, regulations, \r\nresolutions and programmes undertaken to develop solutions to the question. \r\nBut these achievements should not lead to complacency, for where the rights of \r\nthe disabled are concerned we may indeed be moving in the right direction but \r\nthere are always new goals to be reached. \r\nIn this connection the more we do, the more we should continue to do, \r\nbecause the very development of rehabilitation poses challenges to the policy \r\nof integration and eguality of opportunities. The Argentine Republic has \r\nendorsed declarations on this issue, and it has also adhered wholeheartedly to \r\nthem as an expression of our society as a whole and not of our Government \r\nofficials alone. In that sense the international declarations reflect a level \r\nof universal ethical awareness of the issue and are the basis for specific \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n169-170 \r\n(Mr. Araoz. Argentina) \r\naction against discrimination and for the fullest possible integration of all \r\npeople affected by disabilities into the life of the community. \r\nIn that connection we already adhere to the draft standard rules on the \r\nequalization of opportunities for disabled persons that may achieve consensus \r\nin the specialized agencies, such a procedure implying as it does the \r\nwillingness to set common goals, to coordinate efforts and to guide \r\ninternational cooperation. However, after the successful Decade established \r\nby the United Nations, and after all the statements delivered and efforts made \r\nto lay unified foundations, we feel that we must now prepare the way to draft \r\nan international convention on the rights of disabled persons, one that could, \r\nat the highest level of legal commitment, ensure for all the disabled a social \r\nand political response commensurate with the declarations and consensus \r\nreached so far. We must move from the strictly episodic stage of fighting \r\nagainst all discrimination to the stage of positive affirmation of all our \r\nrights. It is true that much remains to be done with regard to discrimination \r\nagainst the disabled, but that must not prevent us from developing a legal \r\nsystem that guarantees special rights for people with special needs, for where \r\nthere is a need, a right is born. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n171 \r\n(Mr. Araoz. Argentina) \r\nIn conclusion, I should like to express my Government\u0027s firm commitment \r\nto join the international community in all efforts aimed at the constant \r\ndevelopment of human society though the contribution of each of its members. \r\nThose whom we call disabled cannot be excluded from this task, because we need \r\nthem their capabilities, their willingness to work, their solidarity to \r\nbuild a more equitable world in which the dignity and worth of the human being \r\nare respected and treasured and take precedence over any differences or \r\nconditions. \r\nMr. ADALA (Kenya): First of all, on behalf of my delegation, may I \r\nextend our sympathy to the Permanent Representative of the Arab Republic of \r\nEgypt and through him to the Government and people of Egypt on their sad loss. \r\nAs we come to the end of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons, \r\nmany of us will agree that the. Decade served a useful purpose in bringing \r\nabout worldwide public awareness and that it led to an improved understanding \r\nof disability. This was indeed one of the objectives of the Decade. The \r\ninitiatives taken by disabled persons themselves, especially in activities \r\nsuch as sports and rehabilitation, have also been very encouraging. We \r\ncommend all, whether individuals, institutions, governmental and \r\nnon-governmental organizations, or the United Nations system and its organs, \r\nfor keeping the spirit of this campaign alive during the whole Decade. The \r\nchallenges of turning this first step success into long-lasting reality will, \r\nhowever, depend on the achievement and sustainment of the goals we set for \r\nourselves in the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons. \r\nThe World Committee for the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons \r\nestimates that 85 per cent of the half-billion men, women and children who \r\nhave disabilities - physical or mental impairments that interfere with the \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n172 \r\n(Mr. Adala. Kenya) \r\nmajor task of living are found in developing countries, where they are \r\ndoubly disadvantaged; by poverty and disability. Our Secretary-General \r\nunderscores the point in his report with the observation that current economic \r\nand social deterioration, marked by low-growth rates, high unemployment, \r\nreduced public expenditure, current structural adjustment programmes and \r\nprivatization, have negatively affected programmes and services for disabled \r\npesons in both developing and developed countries. \r\nThe Government and the people of Kenya, under the leadership of \r\nHis Excellency President Daniel Arap Moi, have striven over the years to \r\ncreate a positive image through education and by improving the conditions of \r\ni persons with disabilities. Special institutions for teaching disabled \r\npersons, vocational rehabilitation centres for training in skills, and several \r\n; thousand individuals disabled persons and their families - have been \r\n\u003c assisted through a National Trust Fund established in 1980 by the Head of \r\n; State. Our main goal has been to achieve development and secure opportunities \r\n, that can allow the integration of disabled into society and make them \r\nself-reliant. \r\nThe Government of Kenya is therefore doing its utmost to further the \r\nimplementation of the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons as \r\ni\u003e \r\n, envisaged by the World Committee for the United Nations Decade of Disabled \r\nPersons. First, our Head of State spearheaded a nationwide fund-raising \r\n[\u0027 \r\ncampaign. It collected over $2 million, which is now being used in activities \r\nbeneficial to the disabled, thus turning awareness into action. Second, the \r\nGovernment of Kenya has increased the participation of persons with \r\n, disabilites in social, cultural, religious, recreational and community life, \r\n,i \r\nand in decision-making at various levels. Third, education, training. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n173 \r\n(Mr. Adala. Kenya) \r\nrehabilitation, and job opportunities are being expanded. Fourth, \r\nequalization of opportunities is one of our main objectives. This has been \r\nachieved to a certain degree by removing many barriers - attitudinal, \r\narchitectural, transportation and communications, and legal. Fifth, through \r\nhealth education, mother-and-child-care services countrywide, expanded \r\nimmunization and the progressive improvement of environmental, occupational \r\nand other health programmes, the Government aims at preventing disabling \r\ndisease and conditions. Sixth, Kenya stands head and shoulders above many \r\ndeveloping countries in expanded community-based rehabilitation services and \r\nself-help programmes involving people with disabilities and their family \r\nmembers. Seventh, our self-help programmes involve everyone disabled and \r\nnon-disabled, rich and poor, young and old, men and women in cooperative \r\nefforts directed at conquering or preventing disability and releasing human \r\npotential for the benefit of all. \r\nIt is the intention of the Kenya Government, as was recently announced by \r\nHis Excellency President Daniel Arap Moi at the seventeenth World Congress of \r\nRehabilitation International - which Kenya had the honour to host from 7 to \r\n11 September this year to support an application to the European Economic \r\nCommunity by the Association of the Physically Disabled of Kenya for funds to \r\nbuild a rehabilitation centre in Kenya. The Government has promised to donate \r\na piece of land for this purpose. As was reported at this Congress, it has \r\nbeen found that many factors - direct or indirect - that cause disabilities in \r\nmany developing countries, particularly in Africa, are preventable. These are \r\nfactors such as diseases, overpopulation, environment degradation, drought, \r\nfamine and internal civil strife. Owing to the socio-economic situations of \r\nthe developing countries, however, they have been unable to alleviate some of \r\nthese occurences. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n174-175 \r\n(Mr. Adala. Kenya) \r\nThe Government and people of Kenya are grateful to the Danish Government, \r\nwhich in 1986 helped Kenya establish an institute of special education \r\noffering a two-year diploma course and short-time in-service training in \r\nspecial education. We thank the International Labour Organisation and the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, which, in collaboration with our \r\nGovernment, initiated a successful employment project for persons with \r\ndisabilities. Kenya was, in 1984, the second country after India in the world \r\nto launch a Campaign on Prevention of Avoidable Disability (IMPACT) called for \r\nin the United Nations Programme of Action, as a priority programme. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n176 \r\n(Mr. Adala. Kenya) \r\nSince that time, one of our major programmes in this respect has been \r\neducation on road safety, particularly among young people. That is our \r\nresponse based on the adage, \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\", \r\nIn our efforts on this project we have received valuable support and \r\ngreat assistance from various bodies, including, to mention but a few, the \r\nRotary Club, the Kenya Society of the Disabled, the Kenya Ear Foundation, the \r\nAfrican Medical Research Foundation and the Association of the Physically \r\nDisabled of Kenya. \r\nKenya believes in the total integration of the disabled into society \r\nwithout marginalizing them in special groups requiring special treatment. We \r\nwill continue to cooperate with the United Nations and other Member States in \r\nfinding ways of achieving this goal. As the Decade has proved, given tools \r\nand opportunities, disabled persons can serve as a source of motivation for \r\nothers and make a significant contribution to the development of their \r\nsocieties. \r\nMr. GALAL (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic): I wish at the \r\noutset to express the deep appreciation of Egypt\u0027s Government, people and \r\ndelegation of the warm sentiments and condolences expressed by representatives \r\nwith respect to the earthquake that struck my country and that caused damage \r\nwe have not yet been able fully to assess. \r\nThe fact that the General Assembly, at the end of the United Nations \r\nDecade of Disabled Persons, is considering the question of the disabled, \r\nunderlines anew the important role of the United Nations in achieving genuine \r\nsocial development through consideration of social issues with particular \r\nattention to the problems of vulnerable groups such as the disabled. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n177 \r\n(Mr. Galal. Egypt) \r\nThat is clear proof of increased public awareness of the question of \r\nhuman rights in all its political, civil, social, economic and cultural \r\ndimensions. \r\nTo achieve effective results in the field of the care, protection and \r\nhuman development of the disabled, there must be coordination of the efforts \r\nof international specialized agencies and non-governmental organizations, in \r\ncooperation with international financing agencies. We urge the adoption of \r\nnational programmes designed to achieve specific goals in line with \r\ninternational programmes and interim plans, and attach importance also to the \r\ncoordination of regional programmes. \r\nEgypt, as a developing country, faces well-known problems relating to its \r\nidevelopment needs. This is especially true at present, when we are engaged in \r\n!: a process of economic restructuring that, very naturally, affects the scope of \r\nour activities in the area of caring for the disabled and other groups. We \r\nhope that international cooperation will yield positive results with respect \r\n! to caring for the disabled, particularly in terms of financing and resources, \r\n; the exchange of scientific and technical information and the transfer of \r\nrelevant technology. \r\ns The Egyptian family remains a social institution with deep roots. \r\nTherefore, the problems of the disabled are neither critical nor urgent in our \r\ncase. But in the future it will be necessary to devote increased attention to \r\n, this problem. Some Egyptian institutions and organizations have already \r\nestablished homes for the disabled providing comprehensive social and medical \r\ncare. \r\nA / 4 7 / P V . 3 6 \r\n178 \r\n(Mr. G a l a l . Egypt) \r\nAs the Secretary-General noted yesterday, war is one of the major causes \r\nof disability. The wars through which our entire region, and Egypt in \r\nparticular, have gone make it incumbent upon us to give special attention to \r\nthe disabled and war invalids by establishing institutions for the disabled, \r\nwhere they can be productive members of society and where they can have the \r\nopportunity to work, produce and engage in artistic and sportive activities. \r\nOne fact is clear from the documents before us: the situation of the \r\ndisabled has improved during the Decade that comes to an end this year, thanks \r\nto the foundation laid by the Decade for the development of policies and \r\nprogrammes for the disabled on the basis of principles and an overall \r\nphilosophy that have been agreed upon by the international community in line \r\nwith the needs and requirements of every nation. Most developing countries \r\nhave not received yet sufficient assistance in the areas of research and \r\nadvanced information. \r\nMy delegation commends the information and the strategies set out in the \r\nprincipal documents of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons; these \r\nwill form the principal foundations of United Nations programmes for the \r\ndisabled in the post-Decade phase. Most prominent among those documents and \r\nprinciples are: the World Programme of Action, which outlines strong \r\naction-oriented policies; a long-term strategy that identifies specific tasks \r\nto be implemented within a certain time-frame; a set of standard rules on \r\nequalization of opportunities for the disabled. Those elements reflect the \r\nstage of progress achieved in developing programmes and objective rules with \r\nrespect to disability. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n179-180 \r\n(Mr. Galal. Egypt) \r\nTo move the World Programme of Action from the phase of identifying goals \r\nand policies to the phase of implementing those policies, all Governments must \r\ncompletely review their policies and assistance programmes for the disabled \r\nand define comprehensive, coherent policies for integrating the disabled into \r\n,all areas of life. Governments must also adopt long-term, positive national \r\nprogrammes of action for the period 1993 to 2002. Governments should \r\n,,.incorporate their plans of action for the disabled in their national long-term \r\nand medium-term programmes and in their annual State budgets; they must \r\n„establish a scale of priorities regarding the fields where funds are needed \r\nand provided. \r\nWith respect to the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons, my \r\ndelegation feels it must make the following observations: \r\nFirst, the paucity of financial resources at the national level is the \r\nit \r\nmajor obstacle to developing the required level of care for the disabled. \r\nSecondly, developing countries still face severe economic and social \r\nIS \r\nproblems that prevent them from adopting long-term strategies. Those \r\nsi\u0027 \r\ncountries, therefore , have s e t t l e d for national medium-term plans with \r\nill! \r\nshort-term o b j e c t i v e s . \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n181 \r\n(Mr. Galal. Egypt) \r\nThirdly, in view of the importance of the rights of the disabled, my \r\ncountry has enacted legislation to guarantee those rights by including in the \r\nlabour laws stipulations of the right to work and the right to employment in \r\nGovernment bodies. \r\nFourthly, given the importance of equal attention to the rights of \r\ndisabled women, the Egyptian disabled woman enjoys equal attention in \r\nprogrammes for governmental and non-governmental organizations. \r\nMy delegation would stress the importance of disability prevention \r\nthrough the peaceful solution of political conflicts in order to avoid the \r\neruption of armed conflicts that would lead to an increased number of disabled \r\nin various regions of the world. L \r\nAt the national level, my country has implemented national programmes for, \r\ndisability prevention through mother-and child-care services, accident , \r\nprevention and the use of automated equipment and rehabilitation programmes. \r\nAt the regional level I would mention the importance of programmes \r\ncarried out by the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) with regard to the \r\ndisabled. There is a need for international support for the ECA owing to the . \r\ndifficult economic conditions existing in Africa, so that the Commission may \r\nbe able to develop further and increase its programmes \r\nIn conclusion, my delegation supports the proposal included in \r\n• t \r\ndocument A/47/214 of 18 May 1992 on the continuation of the Voluntary Fund foi \r\nk \r\nthe United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons, taking into account the \r\nis \r\nfollowing: First, greater attention must be devoted to the disabled in the \r\nleast-developed countries. Secondly, priority must be given to practicable \r\n\u0027», \r\nprogrammes for the implementation of the World Programme of Action and its \r\ncontinuation after the end of the Decade. Thirdly, an appeal must be made to \r\nthe developed countries to increase their donations to the Voluntary Fund for \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n182 \r\n(Mr. Galal. Egypt) \r\nthe United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons so that it may be able to \r\ncontinue to provide its assistance. \r\nMr. MAKA (Zambia): May I begin by expressing my delegation\u0027s \r\nsympathy to the Government and the people of the Arab Republic of Egypt on the \r\ntragedy they recently suffered, which resulted in loss of life and property. \r\nI am happy to contribute to our deliberations marking the conclusion of \r\nthe United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons, a decade devoted to improving \r\nthe welfare of disabled persons throughout the world. The celebration of the \r\nend of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons does not, in the view of \r\nmy delegation, signify the end of international cooperation in this very \r\nimportant area. Instead, serving as a platform of reflection, the celebration \r\nof the conclusion of the Decade should re-energize all of us to enhance the \r\nwelfare of disabled persons. This is the spirit in which I make my statement. \r\nBefore I proceed further, let me say that the Honourable \r\nRobert R. De Cotret, Secretary of State of Canada and the Minister Responsible \r\nfor the Status of Disabled Persons, with whom I had the privilege to work as \r\nVice-Chairman at the Montreal First Meeting of Ministers Responsible for the \r\nStatus of Persons with Disabilities, set the tone of our meeting. My \r\ncolleague fully captured the issues raised and agreed upon in Montreal, and I \r\nam in full accord with his statement. \r\nThe commitment of Member States of the United Nations to the improvement \r\nof the status of the disabled prompted the General Assembly to adopt in \r\nDecember 1982 the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons and \r\nalso to proclaim the period 1983 to 1992 as the United Nations Decade of \r\nDisabled Persons. Through that action it was envisaged that the Member States \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n183 \r\n(Mr. Maka. Zambia) \r\nand United Nations system would be able to implement the Programme of Action \r\nto the full benefit of those members of our society who have disabilities. \r\nThe main focus was to be in areas of prevention and rehabilitation of \r\ndisability and of guaranteeing equal opportunity for all disabled persons in \r\nall areas of human activity. \r\nIn Zambia, the only body that was responsible for the affairs of persons \r\nwith disabilities was the Zambia Council for the Handicapped, established in \r\n1968. Since 1982, the International Year of Disabled Persons, a number of \r\nassociations of persons with disabilities have been formed. Seven of those \r\nassociations have grouped together to form the Zambia Federation of the \r\nDisabled, which has affiliated itself to the Southern African Federation of \r\nthe Disabled and also to Disabled People\u0027s International. \r\nVarious activities were carried out during the Decade, particularly \r\npreventive activities, namely, an immunization programme against measles, \r\ntetanus and polio. That programme was implemented throughout the country and \r\nespecially in the rural areas. Also, primary health-care clinics were \r\nconducted to teach mothers proper feeding methods. Those two programmes have \r\nresulted in a reduction of such disabling diseases as blindness and polio. \r\nPersons with disabilities also became very active in representing their needs \r\nto the Government. \r\nIn my country, efforts are being made to encourage people with \r\ndisabilities to advance in whatever field they wish to engage in. There are \r\nalready persons with disabilities who are top civil servants, lecturers, \r\ndoctors and businessmen. The policy of the Government is to create an \r\nenabling environment for persons with disabilities to succeed in whatever \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n184-185 \r\n(Mr. Maka. Zambia) \r\noccupation they choose, even at the political level. Community-based \r\nrehabilitation, as opposed to institutional rehabilitation, is encouraged. \r\nIncome-generating projects are being worked out in collaboration with \r\nassociations of disabled persons. The policy of the Government is to ask the \r\nassociations to decide which projects could be carried out by people with \r\ndisabilities, and the Government\u0027s duty is to assist in funding or finding \r\nsponsors. In the past, projects were designed for the disabled; those \r\nprojects have not succeeded and have proved to be inappropriate in most cases. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n186 \r\n(Mr. Maka. Zambia) \r\nLast year, 1991, the Zambian Constitution was rewritten. People with \r\ndisabilities presented their views regarding their rights as disabled \r\npersons. Under part III of the Constitution, the protection of human rights \u0027 \r\nand the freedoms of the individual are covered in general terms. Such rights 1 \r\nand freedoms extend fully to persons with disabilities. The Zambia Federation \r\nof the Disabled in partnership with the Government will organize a workshop on \u0027 \r\nequalization of opportunities legislation before the end of the year. \r\nThe Zambia Associations of People with Disabilities have entered into \" \r\nfruitful partnerships with similar organizations outside Zambia. The S \r\nGovernment is also working well with the movements of the disabled. We -\u0027 \r\nencourage people with disabilities to open partnerships with employers\u0027 \r\nassociations, business associations, and trade unions. ~ \r\nThe Zambian Government, through the Zambia Federation of the Disabled, ii \r\nwill carry out a public education campaign through radio, television and local i\\ \r\nnewspapers, and will continue these activities to increase public awareness of ::j \r\nthe objectives of the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons. (it \r\nTo achieve this, the Government will take deliberate steps towards formulating «tj \r\npolicies which will spell out the methods of handling issues concerning :-:: \r\ndisabled persons. \u003c:iit \r\nI am glad to report here that my Ministry organized a national % \r\npolicy-formulating seminar in September this year where, among issues -:. \r\ndiscussed, was the formulation of a national disability policy. \u0027S \r\nThe Zambia Council for the Handicapped, the Zambia Federation of the i:;,. \r\nBlind, and the Zambia Federation of the Disabled were also invited to this î  \r\nimportant seminar to assist by providing their inputs to this policy, together ,(̂  \r\nwith organizations and agencies whose fields of specialization require ^ \r\ninvolvement in such activities. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n187 \r\n(Mr. Maka. Zambia) \r\nThe World Programme of Action, as adopted by the General Assembly, \r\nconstitutes an international long-term plan based on extensive consultations, \r\nand I would like my Ministry to pursue this kind of approach so that the \r\nGovernment, in collaboration and consultation with the associations of the \r\ndisabled, shall be able to develop an innovative approach using a variety of \r\nmedia for conveying information, including the principles and objectives of \r\nthe World Programme of Action to audiences which are not regularly reached by \r\nconventional media or which are unaccustomed to using such media. \r\nThe Zambia Federation of the Disabled is embarking on a nationwide public \r\neducation campaign through radio and television, which will run for 13 weeks \r\neach on radio and television. The target groups are the government, \r\nemployers, the general public, and the disabled themselves. This will assist \r\nin raising the consciousness of the disabled and making the public aware of \r\nthe need to change negative attitudes towards persons with disabilities. \r\nFor us, therefore, the commemoration of the end of the Decade is a time \r\nto take stock of our achievements and of the obstacles encountered in the \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action, and to decide on follow-up action \r\nto the Decade so as to maintain and sustain the momentum achieved in the \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action. The experience gained during the \r\nDecade should serve as a springboard for further action in the years ahead. \r\nWe should emerge from the past Decade reinvigorated and ready to overcome the \r\nchallenges presented by the many obstacles that have hindered the full \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action for the Decade. \r\nAs pointed out in the report of the Secretary-General before us, there is \r\na firm relationship between disability and socio-economic development. \r\nIndeed, the prerequisites for achieving the goals of the Programme of Action \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n188 \r\n(Mr. Maka. Zambia) \r\nare economic and social development, equitable redistribution of resources and \r\nincome, as well as improvement in the living standards of populations. \r\nFor developing countries, in particular the least developed among them, \r\nthe scarcity of financial resources is a major impediment to progress no \r\nmatter how much political will there is in favour of improving the status of \r\npeople with disabilities, integrating them into the mainstream of society, and \r\nenabling them to contribute effectively to national development. The scarcity \r\nof financial resources in developing countries translates as a lack of ability \r\nto develop human resources, and the disabled are among those who suffer most \r\nfrom this constraint. In this regard, I wish to express Zambia\u0027s gratitude to \r\nthose donor countries and agencies which have extended and continue to extend \r\nfinancial support to promote the interests and the human rights of the \r\ndisabled in developing countries, including the promotion of sports for the \r\ndisabled. \r\nWe all recognize that the disabled are the most vulnerable members of our \r\nsocieties. In countries such as my own, the vulnerable segments of our \r\nsociety now face the serious threat of economic insecurity as a result of the \r\npoor performance of the economy and of drought. Zambia has responded to this \r\nchallenge of insecurity by establishing safety nets and other social \r\nprogrammes targeted to the poor and vulnerable. However, the challenge of the \r\nscarcity of financial resources has always been lurking in the background. It \r\nis in the light of this constraint that my delegation is among those \r\nadvocating increased channelling of resources towards programmes aimed at \r\nimproving the welfare of the disabled. \r\nWe are concluding the Decade of Disabled Persons in an improved \r\ninternational political environment. The end of the cold war has brought in \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n189-190 \r\n(Mr. Maka. Zambia) \r\nits wake the renewed interest and commitment of the international community to \r\nquestions of human rights and democracy. Zambia sees this development as \r\nproviding unique opportunities for nations to entrench the rights of the \r\ndisabled in the mainstream of policy formulation. Without the protection and \r\npromotion of the human rights of the disabled, it is rather difficult to \r\nimagine that Governments can be in a position to improve the welfare of \r\ndisabled persons. The basic lever of entrenchment is the enactment of \r\nlegislation to protect the rights of disabled persons, which must be followed \r\nby effective implementation of legislative instruments. \r\nMy Government is in the process of overhauling legal and institutional \r\nmechanisms for improving the welfare of disabled persons. The initial step \r\nhas been the creation of a new Ministry of Community Development and Social \r\nServices, which I have the privilege to head. We are now in the process of \r\nbuilding an information database and improving coordination among agencies \r\nlooking after the welfare of disabled persons. After this, we shall embark on \r\noverhauling the legislative instruments. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n191 \r\n(Mr. Maka. Zambia) \r\nAs we leave this Hall, the challenge for us all is to adopt measures at \r\nthe national, regional and international levels to ensure that the \r\nachievements of the Decade are built upon. The raising of awareness about the \r\nplight, rights, needs and potential of disabled persons has been a major \r\nachievement of the Decade. We now need to follow up that awareness with \r\nconcrete actions that will make a difference in the lives of the disabled. We \r\ntherefore believe that the conclusions reached at the recent Montreal \r\nConference of Ministers Responsible for the Status of Persons with \r\nDisabilities will provide some follow-up mechanisms for future collaboration \r\nat the international level. \r\nMr. GODOY (Cuba) (interpretation from Spanish): I wish to begin by \r\nconveying to the Government and the people of Egypt the condolences of Cuba \r\nfor the loss of human life suffered in the tragedy that has struck that \r\ncountry. \r\nIncreasing international attention has been focused on the situation of \r\nthe disabled, as demonstrated by the scope and level of the debate at this \r\nsession of the General Assembly. In the last 10 years we have achieved \r\ngreater awareness of and world-wide concern for the situation of the \r\ndisabled. In the United Nations that has come about through the \r\nimplementation of the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons. \r\nBut many concerns remain. \r\nThere is very little evidence of a substantial improvement in the \r\nsituation of disabled persons during the Decade that is now coming to an end. \r\nIn our view, improvement in the world-wide situation of disabled persons, \r\ntheir integration into society and respect for them as human beings can be \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n192 \r\n(Mr. Godoy. Cuba) \r\nachieved only through political will on the part of all States to make these \r\ngoals a priority and through effective international cooperation for the \r\ndevelopment of all countries without discrimination. \r\nIt is obvious and it has been recognized by the vast majority of the \r\ninternational community - that disability is closely linked to economic and \r\nsocial factors, in particular to economic and social development, the \r\nredistribution of resources and income, and the standard of living of the \r\npopulation. The Secretary-General himself, in his report to the Assembly, \r\nmentioned those factors as a prerequisite for achieving the goals of the World \r\nProgramme of Action; he stressed that those goals will be attained only if \r\nprogrammes of international cooperation are expanded beyond their current \r\nscope. \r\nThe deteriorating economic and social situation has harmed programmes and \r\nservices for this segment of the population; this has led to increased social \r\nmarginalization of the disabled. Chances are that this situation will \r\ndeteriorate even more, as international economic relations continue to block \r\nthe access of most countries to development by witholding the resources they \r\nneed to remedy the major causes of disability. \r\nMany of those causes are preventable, thanks to advances in medicine, \r\nproper diet, access to health and education services - in a word, access to \r\nconditions for a life in dignity. Achieving the necessary levels would have \r\nmade it possible to prevent the diseases that cause the irreversible damage \r\nincurred by the majority of the world\u0027s 500 million disabled persons, most of \r\nwhom live in developing countries. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n193 \r\n(Mr. Godoy. Cuba) \r\nMore than a quarter of the world\u0027s population has no access to the most \r\nbasic health services; more than a billion persons live in absolute poverty, \r\nand they are the main victims of disease, hunger, malnutrition, environmental \r\npollution and other disgraceful conditions that affect the health and physical \r\nand mental growth of millions among the marginalized and the forgotten \r\ndisabled. \r\nIt is urgent indeed vital - to change an unjust international economic \r\norder that denies to the countries of the South the right to fight the main \r\ncauses of disability in their countries. True international cooperation for \r\neconomic and social development for all countries - apart from being a \r\nresponsibility of the United Nations and of all States is a moral duty \r\ntowards the humanity of the disabled. This is not a mere North-South \r\ndivision, for in the North too there is a separate world of the dispossessed. \r\nThis is a human tragedy that deserves the greatest attention and support. \r\nWe can proclaim Decades and international Days; we can adopt programmes \r\nof action and resolutions; we can enact national legislation and take other \r\nnational and international steps to improve the situation of disabled persons \r\nand integrate them into society. But it will all be in vain without the \r\npolitical will to place this problem high on the list of priorities of the \r\nUnited Nations and of the world\u0027s States. \r\nThe point is not to pity the disabled or to act out of charity; we must \r\nface the problem as a whole, as a social phenomenon affecting all of mankind, \r\nespecially those living in underdevelopment. The fate of disabled persons is \r\nclosely linked with changes in unjust international economic relations and in \r\nsocial models that perpetuate poverty. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n194 \r\n(Mr. Godoy. Cuba) \r\nDisabled persons must be given the opportunity to be integrated into \r\nsociety, to participate in the economic and social development of their \r\ncountries, to receive the needed medical, social and financial attention, to \r\nhave access to employment on a priority basis and to have the guaranteed right \r\nas citizens to education, culture, sports and any other activities that form a \r\npart of national life. \r\nBefore the revolution in our country, the world of the disabled was a \r\nworld of paternalism and marginalization; the main causes of disability were \r\nthe same as in any other poor country. As a developing country with few \r\nresources, Cuba has been able to make progress towards eradicating those \r\ncauses and towards treating the disabled. That is because since 1959 the \r\npolicy has been that protecting the physical and mental health of the \r\npopulation is a fundamental responsibility and a high priority for the Cuban \r\nState. That has meant taking steps to guarantee these services, based on the \r\nprinciples of free, unlimited access by all Cubans to health and education \r\nservices. \r\nIt has thus been possible to have a health system covering the entire \r\npopulation, which has enabled us to eradicate the communicable diseases that \r\nare still the scourge of the third world. We have developed advanced \r\nprogrammes of mother and child care, of immunization, and of early detection \r\nof conditions, which makes possible appropriate treatment of various diseases \r\nthat cause disabilities. Sufficient food has been made available to meet the \r\nbasic needs of the population. \r\nIt is not only standards of living and health that have helped improve \r\nthe situation of disabled persons in my country. The national educational \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n195 \r\n(Mr. Godoy. Cuba) \r\nsystem guarantees everyone the right to participate in it. There is a special \r\nplace in that system for education for the disabled; we have established a \r\nnetwork of special schools to serve pupils with dysfunctions, guaranteeing \r\neveryone the right and the opportunity to achieve a better life. \r\nCuba has had to develop its programmes in an economic situation that is \r\nmade difficult by the hardening of the economic bockade imposed against our \r\ncountry by the Government of the United States. This prevents access to the \r\nnecessary resources and technology, with serious effects on our social \r\ndevelopment programmes in particular, those designed for the disabled. It \r\nwould be dishonest towards the disabled of Cuba not to stand before this \r\nAssembly and demand respect for their human rights and their humanity by \r\ndenouncing, and stressing the immoral and inhuman nature of, this aggressive \r\npolicy that inflicts such cruelty in this area. \r\nYet, despite the adversity we face, attention to the individual and to \r\nhis problems will remain a priority of our revolution because of the deep \r\nhumanistic convictions of a society that places the human being at the centre \r\nof its concerns. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n196 \r\nMr. PASHOVSKi (Bulgaria): Let me at the very outset express my \r\ndelegation\u0027s heartfelt condolences to the delegation of Egypt in connection \r\nwith the earthquake that struck Cairo, causing numerous deaths and injuries. \r\nIt is my honour and pleasure to speak on behalf of the Bulgarian \r\ndelegation at this meeting convened to mark the conclusion of the United \r\nNations Decade of Disabled Persons. It is the firm commitment of the present \r\nGovernment of democratic Bulgaria to overcome one of the negative legacies of \r\nthe previous regime the hypocritical pretence that all is well in the social \r\nsphere. That policy resulted in deliberately ignoring the needs of vulnerable \r\ngroups, including persons with disabilities. Those problems are now an \r\nintegral element in my Government\u0027s overall measures of social policy-making \r\nand policy-adjustment. \r\nDuring the four meetings yesterday and today we have heard a number of \r\nemotional and impressive statements by high-level representatives of Member \r\nStates as well as by representatives of intergovernmental and non-governmental \r\norganizations gathered here to appraise the achievements of the Decade. I \r\nshould like to express the hope of my delegation that this discussion will \r\nidentify and develop policies and programmes for the disabled on the basis of \r\nthe comprehensive report of the Secretary-General contained in document \r\nA/47/415. \r\nMy delegation cannot but agree with the multilateral approach of \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali to issues concerning disabled persons and related \r\nactivities in the framework of the United Nations system. The successful \r\nprevention of major causes of disability is closely linked to the \r\nstrengthening of the new forms and trends of international cooperation that \r\nare taking shape in the United Nations. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n197 \r\n(Mr. Pashovski. Bulgaria) \r\nThe United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons has been a period of \r\nawareness-raising and action-oriented measures aimed at continued improvement \r\nof the situation of persons with disabilities. My delegation considers the \r\nincreased international awareness of the need for a shift away from charity \r\ntowards comprehensive social development to be one of the main achievements of \r\nthe Decade. We welcome the main idea behind the policies and activities \r\nundertaken during the Decade, namely, the equalization of opportunities for \r\nthe disabled as well as rehabilitation and the prevention of disability. \r\nDespite the comprehensive Programme of Action and the many activities at \r\nboth the international and the national levels, progress in attaining the main \r\ngoals of the Decade has been slow. And here we come again to the need for an \r\nintegrated approach to those issues: disability is closely linked to economic \r\nand social factors. The Bulgarian delegation is convinced that the lofty \r\nobjectives of the Decade cannot be reached without expanding and intensifying \r\ninternational cooperation programmes for development. The main goals of the \r\nProgramme of Action have been hindered by social and economic deterioration, \r\nlow global growth rates, high unemployment and reduced public expenditure, as \r\nwell as by current structural-adjustment programmes under way now, especially \r\nin the countries in transition. \r\nDespite the difficulties ensuing from the process of transition in \r\nBulgaria, disability issues have become an integral part of my country\u0027s \r\nsocial programmes during the United Nations Decade. Long-term arrangements \r\nhave been made on the national and the local levels for addressing problems \r\nrelated to prevention of impairment, disability and handicaps, vocational \r\nrehabilitation and the employment of handicapped and disabled persons. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n198 \r\n(Mr. Pashovski. Bulgaria) \r\nHeadway has been made in creating equal conditions for an independent \r\nlife for handicapped and disabled persons and in ensuring full access to \r\ninformation and public education. A system for social studies has been \r\nestablished, enabling us to estimate the number of handicapped children and \r\nthose with serious forms of disability, and to identify their problems. A \r\nnational programme of action has been worked out, aimed at preventing and \r\nreducing disability and illness and at lowering the death rate from cerebral \r\nand cardiovascular impairments. \r\nConsiderable efforts have been made in Bulgaria to solve a series of \r\nproblems related to handicapped children and disabled persons in general, \r\nthrough the supply of orthopaedic and technical aids and facilities and an \r\nincrease in social benefits for the disabled. Original approaches have been \r\nfound to tackle vocational-rehabilitation issues concerning persons with \r\ndisabilities. A system of \"indoor patronage\" has been tested in practice, \r\nwith the aim of rendering various services to thousands of disabled persons. \r\nContinuing to speak of my country\u0027s national experience in addressing the \r\nissues of disability, I should like to emphasize the establishment of various \r\norganizations of the disabled with a view to enabling them to take an active \r\npart in discussing and handling their own problems. The Union of the Blind \r\nand the Union of the Deaf are well established organizations that play a very \r\nactive role in Bulgaria. In 1989 the Union of Disabled Persons was founded. \r\nAlong with blind and deaf persons that Union also includes individuals with \r\nimpairments of the motor system and those suffering from chronic internal \r\nillnesses. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n199-200 \r\n(Mr. Pashovski. Bulgaria) \r\nIt is important, however, to point out that the present severe economic \r\n4 \r\nsituation has a negative impact on all spheres of Bulgaria\u0027s social \r\n( \r\nactivities. Thus far, the transition to a free-market economy has badly hit a \r\nnumber of social groups in my country. By introducing social safety nets and \r\nreadjusting policy-making, the Government is doing its best to provide what is \r\n* \r\nnecessary so that disabled persons are affected by the recession as little as \r\nJI \r\npossible. For instance, disabled persons have been provided with additional \r\n] \r\ninvalid-pension benefits and advantages in acquiring medicines and in using \r\n\u0027I\u0027 \r\ncity transport. They also enjoy reduced fares for railway and water \r\nii \r\ntransport, and some free trips. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n201 \r\n(Mr. Pashovski. Bulgaria) \r\nThe report of the Secretary-General contains a number of worthy \r\nrecommendations aimed at moving the disability Programme and the activities of \r\nour Organization from awareness-raising to action. Our main task now is to \r\nimplement the guidelines and policy documents developed over the Decade. The \r\nthree major ones among them are the Programme of Action, the long-term \r\nstrategy, and the equalization of opportunities for disabled persons, which \r\nsets global standards supported by an effective monitoring system. \r\nThe recommendations of the Secretary-General\u0027s report require action at \r\ntwo principal levels: national and international. I should like to confirm \r\nfrom this high rostrum the commitment of my Government to bring about the \r\nsuccessful fulfilment of the objectives of the aforementioned key documents \r\nalong with the recommendations of the Secretary-General. \r\nIn conclusion, I should like to express my delegation\u0027s support of the \r\ndraft resolution, which proclaims 3 December as the International Day of \r\nDisabled Persons. On that particular date in 1982, the Assembly adopted \r\nresolution 37/53 and announced thereby the beginning of the United Nations \r\nDecade of Disabled Persons. It is my understanding that the unanimous \r\nadoption of this resolution will bring to a proper conclusion the fruitful \r\ndebate during the four plenary meetings of the General Assembly devoted to the \r\nissues related to persons with disabilities. \r\nPrince DLAMINI (Swaziland): The Kingdom of Swaziland joins the \r\nworld in expressing its condolences on the tragedy that befell our brothers \r\nand sisters in Egypt. We should like to express through you. Sir, our deepest \r\nsympathy to the Government, the people, and especially all those who lost \r\ntheir loved ones. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n202 \r\n(Prince Dlamini. Swaziland) \r\nI realize that it is a bit too late and the majority of us here are a bit \r\ntired. But the truth is that we could not all have spoken at once; otherwise, \r\nchaos would have been among us here. Those of us who came to speak would \r\ntherefore like to express our sincere thanks to you. Sir, and your staff for \r\ngiving us the opportunity to hear the things that we heard and to say the \r\nthings we feel should be said in this Assembly. \r\nOn behalf of His Majesty, King Mswati III, the Government and all the \r\npeople of the Kingdom of Swaziland, I and my delegation take delight in \r\naddressing this forty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United \r\nNations on the conclusion of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons. \r\nBefore I present my views, I feel tempted to express our appreciation that, in \r\nthe spirit of the recognition and awareness of people with disabilities, the \r\nPresident of the United States of America has seen fit that Dr. Bruce Halliday \r\nof Canada be honoured for his vision and services on behalf of the plight of \r\npeople with disabilities. May I also hasten to say that, in my view, there \r\nwas no better time or venue to present this award than in Montreal and at this \r\nOctober meeting of the ministers of the world responsible for the affairs of \r\npeople with disabilities. \r\nFor those of us who stand here representing the people who might never \r\nhave a chance of seeing or meeting with Dr. Bruce Halliday, we say on their \r\nbehalf: \"Thank you very much. We assure you and promise to carry your name \r\nand deeds to our various countries, to those people whom you have been working \r\nfor\". \r\nTo come back to my story, may I say that it may not be easy to speak \r\nagain on this subject without sounding repetitious. But, with all due \r\nrespect, this is meant to emphasize both the seriousness of the subject in \r\nquestion and the concern of those who may not have the opportunity to speak on \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n203 \r\n(Prince Dlamini. Swaziland) \r\ntheir own behalf. The theme of my presentation in Montreal was on sensitizing \r\nthe public to the plight of people with disabilities. Because of the time \r\nfactor, I touched a bit on the problems of small countries like mine, \r\nSwaziland, and others in carrying out our duties as regards problems faced by \r\npeople with disabilities. \r\nIn my intervention, I pointed out that I do not believe in hand-outs. No \r\nwonder I subscribe to the philosophy: \"Do not give a man fish, but rather \r\nteach him how to fish to manage his own life.\" By this, I meant to align \r\nmyself with the observation and suggestion that, to combat this problem, we \r\ntoo in developing countries need to have technicians and experts in medicine, \r\neducation, and occupational areas who will appreciate and understand about \r\ndisabilities. \r\nMay I also add that we do have such people who are entrusted with and can \r\nmaster these courses if and when given the chances. By \"chances\", I refer to \r\ntheir soliciting and acquiring places and scholarships in relevant \r\ninstitutions of learning. This would relieve us of such burdens as we have in \r\nour schools and institutions in places like Swaziland and others. For \r\ninstance, in my own country, in our speech and hearing school at Siteki, we \r\nlack trained personnel. The same applies at the school for the deaf. \r\nDespite all these inconveniences, the Government has nevertheless put up \r\ninstitutions like the Vocational Rehabilitation Centre, where persons with \r\ndisabilities are being trained. We also have a transitional workshop, where \r\nthe Government, with the help of the United Nations Development Programme, \r\nassists our people in practising what they have learned, while at the same \r\ntime searches for places of employment both in government and in the private \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n204-205 \r\n(Prince Dlamini. Swazilan/i) \r\nsector. Having said that, it is no wonder that I welcome the creation of an \r\ninter-ministeral task force that will also work with a view to transferring \r\ntechnology to our developing world. \r\nEver since our meeting in Montreal and here in this Assembly, listening \r\nto speakers has brought to my mind memories of a fairy tale in my country \r\nwhich, by your permission. Sir, I shall tell. In a certain humble homestead, \r\nwhile the mother was away, the eldest and most trustworthy child became very \r\nmischievous, and warned the younger one never to mention what had transpired \r\nduring the absence of the mother, to which the younger one acceded. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n206 \r\n(Prince Dlamini. Swaziland) \r\nWhile they were having supper that evening, the elder chid kept looking \r\nvery scornfully at the young one, trying to make sure that she did not raise \r\nthe subject. The young one responded by forcefully asking, \"Why do you keep \r\non looking at me like that? Do you actually think I told mommy about what you \r\nwere doing? No, I never did. Ask her.\" I need not tell you of the look of \r\ndespair and disappointment on the face of the mother. She had discovered by \r\nmistake that her trusted, obedient child was incapable of doing right in her \r\nabsence. \r\nI relate this primitive story as an analogy with us. Governments and \r\npoliticians, people entrusted and empowered to legislate and administer the \r\naffairs of our fellow citizens. For us, as Governments, as organizations and \r\nas individuals, to be reminded of 1982 as the year that saw the celebrated \r\ndeclaration of the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons, and \r\nthe confession that not much has been achieved or done over the years and that \r\nnow we have even more persons with disabilities than we did before, leaves a \r\nlot to be desired. \r\nWith the United Nations as our mother body and our various Governments \r\nits appendages, I cannot help but admit that these revelations leave us with \r\nnothing but sheer nakedness. It exposes us as Governments and peoples who \r\nhave failed and are perpetually failing. It exposes our insincerity, our \r\ninsensitivity and the uncaring attitude we have always displayed towards the \r\nplight of those members of our society who could do just as well given an \r\nopportunity. \r\nYesterday I heard Mr. Malinga of Zimbabwe, the Chairman of the Disabled \r\nPeople\u0027s International, read out some very sad quotations by some of our \r\nbrothers and sisters with disabilities. It is not the best thing to hear \r\nthese words: \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n207 \r\n(Prince Dlamini. Swaziland) \r\n\"It is always the people who believe themselves to be normal who make the \r\nmistake of automatically underestimating me.\" \r\nIt must touch someone with a conscience to hear a fellow-countryman \r\nlament: \r\n\"It is a story of depression. These stories are untold to the world, and \r\ngovernment is not serious about the welfare of those who are invalids. \r\nThere is only lip-service. In my country, one who is rendered disabled \r\nbecomes a street beggar and complete destitute.\" \r\nWith those words of anguish and lamentation, I ask you. Where is the source of \r\npride of all of us here who are in government, regardless of what country we \r\ncome from? \r\nHow good it is that people with disabilities are not calling for \r\nhand-outs nor are they waiting for crocodile tears. All they need, all they \r\nwant, and all they deserve is what most of us already have, and that is \r\nnothing other than an equal opportunity in all forms of human endeavours. \r\nThat opportunity means full rights and participation in all human activities. \r\nComing as I do from Swaziland, one of the developing countries, and \r\nknowing too that we have not done enough for, and together with, persons with \r\ndisabilities, I note with satisfaction and appreciation what others in some \r\nother countries, governments and ministers, have achieved and aspire to for \r\nthe sake of people with disabilities. I have in mind countries like Canada, \u0027 \r\nand if I may speak on behalf of the distant many, let me say that we certainly \r\napplaud the attitude, the vision, the energy of the Canadian Secretary of \r\nState and Minister responsible for the status of disabled persons, the \r\nHonourable Robert de Cotret. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n208-210 \r\nMr. KAMARA (Sierra Leone): Please permit me to begin by expressing, \r\non behalf of the Sierra Leone delegation, profound condolences to the \r\nGovernment and people of the Republic of Egypt on the severe disaster that \r\nbefell them two days ago, which resulted in heavy loss of life and property. \r\nWe share their grief and we sincerely hope and pray that God will console the \r\nbereaved families and the entire nation. \r\nWe are all quite aware already that we are here to commemorate the \r\nconclusion of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons, which was an \r\nextremely important initiative designed to continue to raise awareness of \r\ndisability-related issues. As has been abundantly emphasized by various \r\nspeakers, we have now reached the end of the awareness-raising aspect and the \r\nbeginning of the action phase. In this regard, I should like to give some \r\nidea of what Sierra Leone has managed to achieve over the Decade and what \r\nplans are afoot for improving the lives and living conditions of disabled \r\npeople in that country, despite the many constraints with which we are \r\nconfronted. I am sure that many people are aware of our recent plight caused \r\nby the rebel incursion. I will come to that. \r\nOver the years since the early 1950s a number of voluntary organizations \r\ndedicated to serving different categories of disability groups have sprung up \r\nin the country, starting with the Blind Welfare Committee in 1951. This came \r\ninto being through the influence of the then-British Empire Society for the \r\nBlind, subsequently known as the Royal Commonwealth Society for the Blind and \r\nnow as Sight Savers. That Blind Welfare Committee later got a charter to \r\nbecome the Sierra Leone Blind Welfare Society. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n211 \r\n(Mr. Kamara. Sierra r.e?n.) \r\nFollowing in the footsteps of that organization, the Cheshire Homes \r\nAssociation and the National Society for the Deaf came into existence in the \r\nearly 1960s. Then, early in the 1970s the Society for Mentally Retarded \r\nChildren was born. All these organizations set out primarily to take care of \r\nthe educational needs of children belonging to their respective disability \r\ngroups: they built schools for those children. There was hardly any \r\npractical effort to address the needs of disabled adults. Moreover, there \r\nwere no reliable statistics on the number of disabled people in the country or \r\nof the prevalence and incidence of any given disabling condition. \r\nThe first attempt at addressing the needs of disabled adults was made by \r\nthe Government in 1971, when a farmcraft centre for blind male adults was \r\nestablished in the eastern region of the country under the then Ministry of \r\nSocial Welfare now the Division of Social Services in the Department of \r\nHealth and Social Services - with the financial and technical assistance of \r\nthe Royal Commonwealth Society for the Blind. That institution was meant to \r\ntrain blind male adults in basic gardening and handicraft skills in a rural \r\nsetting. \r\nUp to that point in time there was no viable organization of disabled \r\npersons themselves to influence the course of events in their own interests. • \r\nThe first attempt at setting up such an organization came in the late 1960s, \r\nwhen an organization of the blind was set up by a few blind people, including \r\nmyself. Unfortunately, however, it was short lived. It was not until 1976 \r\nthat the Sierra Leone Association of the Blind eventually managed to get off ,; \r\nthe ground; it has continued to survive, in spite of some hiccoughs. \r\nMeanwhile, in 1972 the Government started to show interest in the welfarê  \r\nof disabled adults in general, especially in the areas of rehabilitation and ., \r\njob placement. Thus, in October 1972 a small unit was set up in the then . \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n212 \r\n(Mr. Kamara. Sierra Leone) \r\nMinistry of Social Welfare and given responsibility for supervising some \r\naspects of rehabilitation of the handicapped and securing job opportunities \r\nfor suitably qualified handicapped persons. It is gratifying to note that \r\nright from that point a handicapped person was put in charge of that unit. \r\nThis move by the Government seemed to give impetus to efforts by \r\nvoluntary non-governmental organizations to explore areas of rehabilitating \r\ndisabled persons in various parts of the country. For instance, the Seventh \r\nDay Adventist Mission started a rehabilitation programme for victims of \r\nleprosy and polio at their hospital at Massanga in the northern region in \r\ncollaboration with the leprosy control programme. The Catholic Mission also \r\nstarted a workshop in the northern region for the manufacture of prosthetic \r\nand orthopaedic appliances as well as for the rehabilitation of some polio and \r\nleprosy victims. \r\nIn the mid-1970s, the Baptist Mission, with the financial and technical \r\nassistance of Germany\u0027s Mission to the blind, started an agricultural \r\nrehabilitation programme for the blind at a small village near the town of \r\nLunsar in the North, where there is a high incidence of onchocerciasis. That \r\nprogramme has been operating on the basis of the concept of community-based \r\nrehabilitation. \r\nEfforts in the areas of both educating disabled children and \r\nrehabilitating disabled adults have continued to increase over the years, \r\nespecially since 1981, which the General Assembly declared as the \r\nInternational Year of Disabled Persons. For instance, the number of schools \r\nboth for blind and for deaf children increased from one to two each. One must \r\nadmit that, given the estimated population of blind children - a little over \r\n100,000 and that of deaf children - just a little under 90,000 in a \r\nnational population of 4 million, two schools for each of those categories. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n213 \r\n(Mr. Kamara. Sierra T.epn-) \r\neach school having less than 100 pupils, is grossly inadequate. But there are \u0027 \r\nplans to improve the situation when funds and other resources become available.\u0027 \r\nSince the beginning of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons a •\u003e \r\nnumber of developments in the disability field have taken place in our \r\ncountry, although at a rather slow pace. That is because of a number of e \r\nfactors including economic decline and socio-political instability, especially | \r\nrecently with the onset of the rebel incursion in the eastern and southern .:: \r\nregions of the country: a direct spillover from the Liberian civil war next : \r\ndoor. \r\nIt is rather unfortunate that throughout the Decade and until quite \r\nrecently disabled persons themselves have played a rather low-key role in \r\ntheir own affairs in my country. This was dictated largely by economic \r\nconstraints and to some extent a lack of motivation. It was only towards the \r\nend of the Decade more specifically between 1990 and this year that some \r\norganizations of disabled persons, such as the polio victims\u0027 association, the \r\nSierra Leone Young Disabled Persons Organization and the Sierra Leone \r\nAssociation of the Blind, made some moves towards getting the voice of the \r\ndisabled heard in the right places. \r\nFor instance, in two days\u0027 time, on 15 October, the Sierra Leone Blind \r\nWelfare Society will be observing White Cane Day for the first time in the \r\ncountry\u0027s history. October has been declared the Month of the Blind in Sierra \r\nLeone. My minister will be making a radio broadcast on Thursday morning. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n214-215 \r\n(Mr. Kamara. Siarra Leone) \r\nThe situation has been helped immensely since 29 April this year, when a \r\nnew, energetic, youthful and concerned regime took over the reins of \r\nGovernemnt of the country. It has since manifested a great deal of interest \r\nin the welfare not only of non-disabled but of disabled citizens as well. It \r\nis a manifestation of this positive development that I am here today, a \r\ntotally blind person representing my country at this very important \r\ngathering. Perhaps, had it been another regime, a non-disabled person would \r\nhave stood here. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n216 \r\n(Mr. Kamara. Sierra r.enne) \r\nVarious international non-governmental organizations and members of the \r\nUnited Nations family have made very significant contributions, directly or \r\nindirectly, towards improving the situation of the disabled in our country \r\nover the Decade. For instance, in late 1984 and early 1985 the United Nations \r\nChildren\u0027s Fund (UNICEF) funded a national disability survey, which was \r\ncarried out jointly by the then Ministry of Social Welfare and Rural \r\nDevelopment and the then Ministry of National Development and Economic i \r\nPlanning. This survey had three main objectives: first, to determine the i \r\nprevalence and incidence of different types of disability in the country; i \r\nsecondly, to establish the number of disabled infants, young children and \r\nwomen in the country; and, thirdly, to find out the different types of a \r\ninstitutions serving the different categories of disabled persons in the a \r\ncountry, with the overall goal of improving such services. ii \r\nAs a result of that disability survey, it was discovered that the general :;: \r\ntrend in the disability ratio in the country was within the United Nations ii \r\nestimate of 10 per cent of the total population. It was also discovered that :• \r\nmuch of this disability trend was a result of vitamin deficiency, genetic »;\u003c \r\ndefects, childhood diseases and accidents. Due to the rebel incursion that I ;, \r\nhave already mentioned, it is expected that war-affected areas of the country ;:; \r\nwill experience a much higher degree of disablement as a result of both :, \r\nwar-inflicted injuries and diseases caused by malnutrition owing to the lack ^ \r\nof food in the war-affected areas. At this point, it is interesting to note l|(| \r\nthat even the present Head of State would have ended up being disabled as a .. \r\nresult of a war injury he sustained at the front last year, but for sheer luck , \r\non his part. V \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n217 \r\n(Mr. Kamara. Sierra Leone) \r\nIn 1988 UNICEF sponsored the participation of a senior officer of my \r\nMinistry - the then Ministry of Rural Development, Social Services and Youth \r\nin a symposium on visually handicapped infants and young children that took \r\nplace in Edinburgh, Scotland, from 7 to 13 August. In 1989 UNICEF again \r\nmanifested further interest in the welfare of disabled infants and young \r\nchildren by sponsoring a one-day symposium on childhood disability in Sierra \r\nLeone and its medical, social and economic implications, which took place in \r\nFreetown in April of that year. More recently, UNICEF again sponsored a \r\none-day symposium on the plight of disabled infants and young children in \r\nSierra Leone, which took place, again in Freetown, on 21 May this year. \r\nBut over and above all this, UNICEF\u0027s efforts in the extended programme \r\nof immunization have made a great mark and have contributed tremendously \r\ntowards curbing the disability trend in the country caused by the major \r\ni childhood disabling diseases, such as poliomyelitis, whooping cough, measles, \r\ni diphtheria and so on, which often lead not only to disability but even to \r\n; death. Over the years since the start of this programme in the mid-1980s the \r\n. coverage of immunization against these diseases for children below five years \r\n, of age has risen most impressively, from about 6 per cent at the beginning of \r\n, the programme to over 60 per cent. \r\nIt is therefore with great delight that I register our deep gratitude for \r\n, the important role that UNICEF has played during the Decade of Disabled \r\nPersons towards both curbing the incidence of disablement and addressing the \r\nneeds of disabled infants and young children in Sierra Leone. It is also \r\n; extremely important to note that UNICEF has helped to set up an organization \r\nfor aid to disabled infants and young children in the country. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n218 \r\n(Mr. Kamara. Sierra Leone) \r\nIn view of this very impressive role that UNICEF has played and continues \r\nto play in the field of disability, I wish to seize this opportunity to appeal \r\nto other United Nations agencies and other international non-governmental \r\norganizations those already operating in Sierra Leone, such as the Christian \r\nChildren\u0027s Fund, Foster Parents Plan International, Save the Children Fund, \r\nAction Aid, and so on, and those not yet established in Sierra Leone to \r\nemulate the brilliant example already set by UNICEF in the interests of the \r\ndisabled. \r\nFinally, I would like to mention something about my participation in the \r\nSeventeenth World Congress of Rehabilitation International, which took place \r\nin Nairobi, Kenya, from 7 to 11 September this year, and one of the \r\npost-Congress seminars that also took place in Nairobi, from 12 to \r\n13 September. My reason for this is mainly to express the sincere hope that \r\nthe Nairobi Plan of Action for the 1990s and beyond, as well as the \r\nrecommendations in the Secretary-General\u0027s report, will be taken into very \r\nserious consideration not only by our various Governments, but also by \r\ndisabled persons themselves and the general public in our respective nations \r\nto make them a reality and to ensure the Decade is not forgotten, but that, as \r\nother speakers have already said, it is only the beginning of things to come \r\nfor the betterment of the disabled in our countries and the world over. \r\nMr. TURK (Slovenia): At the outset, I should like to express, on \r\nbehalf of the delegation of Slovenia, sincere condolences to the Government \r\nand people of Egypt at this tragic moment, when Cairo has been struck by a \r\nterrible earthquake. At this moment of tragedy, the people of Egypt has the \r\nsolidarity and sympathy of the Government and people of Slovenia. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n219-220 \r\n(Mr. Turk. Slovenia) \r\nOur statement on the conclusion of the United Nations Decade of Disabled \r\nPersons will be short and concise, concentrating on certain major policy \r\nelements pursued by the Government of Slovenia. \r\nSlovenia is a new Member of the United Nations and a new independent \r\nState. Nevertheless, our Government pays particular attention to the \r\nprotection of disabled perons and has taken the objectives of the United \r\nNations Decade of Disabled Persons seriously. In 1991, the year of Slovenia\u0027s \r\nindependence, the Parliament adopted a strategy of development for the \r\nprotection of disabled persons, taking into account the objectives of the \r\nUnited Nations Decade. \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n221 \r\n(Mr. Turk. Slovenia) \r\nProtection is one of the two principal policy elements of the strategy. \r\nIt is geared, however, towards creating conditions for the independent \r\nexistence of each disabled person, upholding his or her dignity and full \r\nenjoyment of human rights. \r\nThe policy includes a series of measures targeted on the protection of \r\nspecific groups of disabled, namely, children, adults, the elderly and \r\ndisabled refugees. Disabled children enjoy cost-free education and special \r\nvocational training at the primary-school level. All disabled children enjoy \r\ncost-free health care. Their parents and guardians enjoy considerable tax \r\nalleviation and benefits in matters of housing, as well as preferential status \r\nin matters of social benefits. It is possible for disabled youths to find \r\nmeaningful employment with the assistance of specialized institutions. \r\nSpecial benefits are provided for adult disabled persons; they range from \r\ntax benefits to special incentives for enterprises that employ disabled \r\npersons. Naturally, the benefits in the field of health care and \r\nrehabilitation constitute an important part of the Goverment\u0027s policy in this \r\ndomain. \r\nElderly disabled persons enjoy other types of protection, including \r\nspecial medical assistance, which is available to them either at their homes \r\nor in specialized hospitals. \r\nThe policies pursued by the Government are an important feature of the \r\noverall care for and protection of disabled persons in Slovenia. However, the \r\nGovernment is fully aware that Government action alone cannot yield optimal \r\nresults. Effective participation of the disabled is vital and this is the \r\nsecond main policy element. Effective participation is necessary both at the \r\nlevel of policy design and in the implementation of policies. Only such \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n222 \r\n(Mr. Turk. Slovenia) \r\nparticipation can produce appropriate medical, social and occupational \r\nintegration of disabled persons into the wider society. Moreover, the need to \r\nfoster prevention, early detection and medical rehabilitation of disability \r\nrequires the effective participation of the disabled. \r\nIn Slovenia there are around 140,000 disabled persons, or 7 per cent of \r\nthe total population. All of them are involved in the work of appropriate \r\nassociations freely established by the disabled themselves. The Government of \r\nSlovenia actively supports those organizations through different incentives \r\nand subsidies and, above all, as a source from which most valuable initiatives \r\nemerge. \r\nIn recent months many of those initiatives have been devoted to problems \r\nconcerning disabled refugees. The total number of refugees in Slovenia at \r\npresent is 100,000, which is roughly 5 per cent of the total population. Most \r\nof them come from wartorn areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and many of them \r\nare disabled. Their problems, including mental problems, are extremely \r\nserious and they require help. The Governmnt institutions of Slovenia and \r\ninstitutions created by the disabled persons in Slovenia are rendering that \r\nhelp. \r\nSlovenia wishes to be active in the international efforts in the field of \r\nassistance to disabled persons. We have expertise and professional \r\nexperience. We have already established cooperation with the United Nations \r\nOffice for the Decade of Disabled Persons in Vienna. The end of the Decade \r\ndoes not mean the end of action quite the contrary. For Slovenia, it means \r\nthe beginning of the process of expanded cooperation in the United Nations \r\nA/47/PV.36 \r\n223 \r\n(Mr. Turk. Slovenia) \r\neffort in this domain. We are looking forward to practical action for \r\nexpansion of that cooperation, in particular through our cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations Office in Vienna. \r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): We have just heard the \r\nlast speaker in the debate on this agenda item. Given the lateness of the \r\nhour, and in order to allow a substantial number of Member States to \r\nparticipate in the consideration of draft resolution A/47/L.4, the General \r\nAssembly will take a decision on the draft resolution as the last item on the \r\nagenda of its meeting for tomorrow morning. \r\nThe meeting rose at 11 p.m. \r\n"
