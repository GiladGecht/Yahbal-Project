The \r\nfollowing is a tentative programme regarding some agenda items to be \r\nconsidered during November and the first week of December. \r\nAs announced earlier, on Monday, 2 November, and Tuesday, 3 November, the \r\nGeneral Assembly will hold a debate on agenda item 79, \"Report of the United \r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development\". \r\nOn Monday, 16 November, the Assembly will consider agenda item 18, \r\n\"Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial \r\nCountries and Peoples\", and reports of the Fourth Committee. \r\nOn Tuesday, 17 November, in the morning the Assembly will take up agenda \r\nitem 22, \"The situation of democracy and human rights in Haiti\", iK^^tenda \r\nitem 36, \"The situation in Central America: procedures for the \r\nof a firm and lasting peace and progress in fashioning a region \r\nfreedom, democracy and development\" \r\nOn Tuesday afternoon, 17 November, on Wednesday, 18 NovembJ \r\nThursday, 19 November, the Assembly will consider agenda it \r\napartheid of the Government of South Africa\", together with \r\n\"United Nations Educational and Training Programme for Souta \r\nCilm# \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n6 \r\n(The President) \r\nOn Wednesday, 25 November, in the morning, the Assembly will take up \r\nagenda item 26, \"Zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic\", as well \r\nas the reports of the Sixth Committee. \r\nThe following week, starting on Monday, 30 November, in the afternoon, \r\nthe Assembly will take up agenda item 30, \"Question of Palestine\". \r\nOn Tuesday, 1 December, in the afternoon, the Assembly will also take up \r\na report of the Second Committee on agenda item 12, \"Report of the Economic \r\nand Social Council\". \r\nOn Wednesday, 2 December, in the afternoon, the Assembly will take up \r\nagenda item 48, \"Commemgza^pn of the f ^ ^ ^ t h anniversary of the United \r\nNations in 19 \r\nOn Th \r\nAs si \r\nof tries\u0027 \r\nI shd \r\nclosely as \r\nan orderly fashion? \r\ndraft resolutions to \r\nadequate time to examine \r\nREPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENER \r\nTHE SECRETARY-GENERAL (A/47/1, \r\nThe PRESIDENTS I Should\u0027 \r\nafternoon we shall hear a number of speak\" \r\nber, in the morning, the \r\nbin the Middle East\", \r\n^appear in the verbatim \r\nshall keep the \r\nrs for all \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n7 \r\n(The President) \r\nremaining speakers will be heard at a subsequent meeting to be held on Monday, \r\n26 October in the afternoon. \r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the Work of the Organization, and \r\nin particular his report \"An Agenda for Peace\", address a multitude of issues \r\nand relate to many items on the agenda of the General Assembly. The debate on \r\nagenda item 10, which began last Friday and continues today, is indicative of \r\nthe importance Member States attach to issues raised therein. It is evident \r\nthat the discussions to be held under other agenda items will contribute to \r\nthis debate and to the further examination of the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\nproposals in general and specific terms. \r\nGiven the interdisciplinary nature of the debate, the proposals that \r\nMember States will submit as the outcome of these discussions and \r\nconsultations must be considered in coordination with the Main Committees \r\nwhich, in connection with the agenda items allocated to them, will also be \r\ntaking up various aspects of the issues raised in \"An Agenda for Peace\". \r\nI shall conduct informal consultations and put in place a working \r\nmechanism. \r\nFurthermore, I should like to suggest that all items directly related to \r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" remain open pending the conclusion of discussions among \r\nMember States on the issues raised. \r\nMr. CHOWDHURY (Bangladesh): Allow me to begin by expressing our \r\nsincere felicitations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, for his \r\nthought-provoking report \"An Agenda for Peace\" and also for the report on the \r\nwork of the Organization. They represent a timely and essential contribution \r\nto the reform and reorganization of the United Nations, in view of the recent \r\ntransformations in international relations, and contain innovative ideas and \r\nconcrete proposals to make the United Nations an effective and efficient \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n8-10 \r\n(Mr. Chowdhury. Bangladesh) \r\nOrganization responsive to the needs and challenges of contemporary times and \r\nrealities. Hence they deserve our sincere and careful consideration. \r\nWe are meeting at a turning-point of world history. The divisive era of \r\nthe cold war is gone, but a unifying and constructive structure is yet to \r\nemerge in its place. Inter-State and intra-State conflicts abound with \r\npotential to threaten international peace and security. Poverty, hunger and \r\nunderdevelopment in many parts of the globe provide ever new breeding grounds \r\nfor more conflicts and threaten inter-State harmony and security. Unabated \r\nenvironmental degradation all over the world is pushing us to the brink of \r\ndisaster. Fairness, justice and equity in inter-State relations have been \r\nreplaced by brute power politics based on short-sighted gains. Against this \r\nbackdrop, we need to think and work harder together and to redouble our \r\nefforts to bring about necessary and realistic changes in our Organization, \r\nwhich stands as our only hope in the face of so many built-in adversaries and \r\ndifficult challenges. \r\nLegitimate security concerns of small States remain largely ignored and, \r\nwhat is worse, ameliorating operative actions are hardly taken in time. Small \r\nStates, which constitute the majority of the international community, are the \r\nmost vulnerable in terms of security. The provisions of the Charter, if \r\nfollowed and implemented, are the best guarantee of their sovereignty and \r\nsecurity. The world of today, which is free from ideological rivalry, offers \r\na unique opportunity to the United Nations to act decisively and resolutely to \r\npreserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the small and weaker \r\nStates. \r\nI should now like briefly to present my delegation\u0027s comments on the key \r\nproposals of the Secretary-General to strengthen the United Nations in the \r\nfield of maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n11 \r\n(Mr. Chowdhury. Bangladesh) \r\nWe agree with the prescription articulated in the report to employ \r\ndiplomacy and all pacific means to ease tensions before they develop into \r\nconflicts, on the basis of the age-old golden rule that prevention is better \r\nthan cure. Confidence-building measures and strict adherence to the norms of \r\ngood-neighbourliness are the very preconditions to avoid conflicts and promote \r\npeace and harmony between States. The Non-Aligned Movement therefore attaches \r\ngreat importance to the principles of respect for the sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of States and.non-interference in each other\u0027s internal \r\naffairs. \r\nResort to fact-finding missions and the growing emphasis on strengthening \r\nthe early warning systems of the United Nations are - and indeed should be \r\nhelpful tools to help preventive diplomacy work. We do not therefore have any \r\nhesitation in going for the proposal of preventive deployment, since an \r\nimpartial and prudent use of such a measure may prove to be \"a stitch in time\" \r\nthat can save \"nine stitches\" later. Such steps, although they involve high \r\nrisk, have the potential of preventing both internal and inter-State \r\nconflicts. Bangladesh hopes that the Security Council will provide due \r\nleadership in such situations. \r\nIt is axiomatic that all Member States would abide strictly by the letter \r\nand spirit of the prescription for the pacific settlement of disputes set \r\nforth in Chapter VI of the Charter before taking any peacemaking measure \r\nreferred to in Chapter VII of the Charter. There can be no two opinions about \r\nthe fact that the Charter provides a central role for the Security Council in \r\nthe realm of making, keeping and enforcing peace in the world. But the \r\ncurrent world political setting also provides opportunities to the \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n12 \r\n(Mr. Chowdhury. Bangladesh) \r\nSecretary-General to play an important role in assisting the Security Council \r\nand the General Assembly in performing their peacemaking role. \r\nThe role of the General Assembly also needs to be strengthened in the \r\ndomain of the maintenance of international peace and security. The General \r\nAssembly, as the conscience of the world, can and should be made more \r\neffective in creating a world public opinion and legitimizing United Nations \r\nactions against aggression and containing any situation that might threaten \r\npeace and stability in any region of the world. \r\nThe important and decisive role of the International Court of Justice in \r\nthe United Nations system should be utilized for the resolution of conflicts \r\nwherever possible in the changed global context. Greater resort to the Court, \r\nwhich has so far been underutilized, would surely enhance contributions to \r\npeacemaking and promote the rule of law in international relations. \r\nAlthough an innovation on the Charter, the United Nations peace-keeping \r\noperations have been resorted to on very many occasions and have been \r\nsuccessful in implementing many peace settlements. The increase in the number \r\nof regional and ethnic conflicts in recent years has without doubt imposed \r\ntremendous demands on the United Nations peace-keeping operations. This has \r\nposed problems with regard to logistics, equipment and personnel and, most \r\nimportantly, with regard to finance. \r\nBangladesh is participating in a number of United Nations peace-keeping \r\noperations, such as the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia \r\n(UNTAC), the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), the United Nations \r\nIraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM), the United Nations Mission for the \r\nReferendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) and the United Nations Operations in \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n13 \r\n(Mr. Chowdhury. Bangladesh) \r\nSomalia (UNOSOM). And these troops are going through the joys and \r\ntribulations of maintaining peace. We stand ready to provide military and \r\ncivilian personnel for deployment in United Nations peace-keeping operations \r\nin any part of the globe. \r\nWe are, however, deeply concerned at the limited availability of \r\nresources for peace-keeping operations as this is bound to create problems for \r\npresent and future United Nations operations. Bangladesh, in this context, \r\nagrees with the Secretary-General\u0027s proposal to establish a peace-keeping \r\nreserve fund of $50 million to meet the start-up costs of peace-keeping \r\noperations. Bangladesh also supports the proposal for the establishment of a \r\nUnited Nations peace endowment fund in order to make available a support base \r\nfor future United Nations operations. \r\nThe concept of peace-building is very important and constructive since it \r\nwould make peace durable and reduce the chances of conflicts reoccurring. We \r\nfully agree with the Secretary-General\u0027s view that measures to consolidate \r\npeace and instil a sense of confidence in people are essential for peacemaking \r\nand peace-keeping operations to be truly successful. \r\nAdequate international support and a conducive environment are essential \r\nfor healing the wounds and restoring the damage caused by conflicts. \r\nFinancial and technical assistance are very important to the rebuilding of the \r\nbattered economies so that people\u0027s confidence can be restored. The promotion \r\nof regional cooperation is of great significance to the attempts at \r\npost-conflict peace-building. \r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s proposal to streamline the Secretariat in order \r\nto make it more efficient and to avoid duplication of work deserves our \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n14 \r\n(Mr. Chowdhury. Bangladesh) \r\nattention. We think he is on the right track when he considers measures to \r\nreform and revitalize the Organization by 1995 to ensure the fullest \r\nutilization of its potential. Making the Organization more democratic, \r\ntransparent and responsive to new realities is as essential as ensuring proper \r\ncoordination between the various organs and agencies of the United Nations. \r\nThere is a growing realization that international peace and security have \r\nvery important socio-economic dimensions. The inextricable link between \r\nsocio-economic development and peace needs to be recognized. Widespread \r\npoverty, hunger, malnutrition, disease, illiteracy, social backwardness, \r\ndeprivation and economic stagnation constitute potential sources of conflict. \r\nIt is imperative that no agenda for global peace and security be formulated or \r\nimplemented without giving due attention to eradicating poverty and \r\nreactivating the economic growth of developing countries. Can any durable \r\npeace be achieved when more than one fifth of the world\u0027s population lives in \r\nabsolute poverty? \r\nThe post-cold-war era has provided the United Nations with a unique and \r\ncentral role in international relations. The future of our planet and our \r\nwell-being depend on how best we can utilize the potentials of the \r\nOrganization and how efficiently and speedily we can translate into reality \r\nits objectives as enshrined in the Charter. \r\nThe proposals of the Secretary-General are certainly aimed at making our \r\nOrganization more efficient in facing the new challenges and adapting to the \r\nnew realities. We strongly feel that an open-ended working group should be \r\nestablished to consider the Secretary-General\u0027s valuable proposals. This \r\ngroup could study the proposals in detail and Member States would also be able \r\nto contribute to the efforts to strengthen the United Nations. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n15 \r\n(Mr. Chowdhury, Bangladesh) \r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to underscore the importance of \r\nenhanced cooperation of the States Members of our Organization to make it more \r\ndynamic and equip it with the necessary tools effectively to maintain peace \r\nand stability in the world. I sincerely believe that our concerted efforts in \r\nthis direction will enable us to achieve a better United Nations and build a \r\nbetter future for future generations.* \r\n* Mr. Elhouderi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n16 \r\nMr. AL-HADAn (Yemen) (interpretation from Arabic): Allow me, at the \r\noutset, to extend to the people and Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt \r\nour sincere condolences over the natural disaster that befell that country, \r\nand the resultant death of hundreds of people and much material damage. \r\nMy delegation is grateful to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for preparing the valuable report before us at the \r\nrequest of the Security Council at its summit on 31 January 1992. By \r\nreviewing a wide range of issues, and by putting forward proposals aimed at \r\nenhancing and reinforcing the efficiency of the United Nations under the \r\nCharter to enable it to undertake the tasks of preventive diplomacy, \r\npeace-keeping and peacemaking, the Secretary-General has been able to generate \r\namong the Members of the General Assembly a fruitful discussion on how this \r\nmight be achieved. \r\nThe post-cold-war era is characterized by the spread of democracy, \r\npluralism and support for human rights. All these principles have been \r\nadopted by a number of countries at a time of widespread belief in their \r\nvalidity and in the need to ensure adherence thereto in the interests of \r\ninternational peace and security. However, we still believe the point of \r\ndeparture in dealing with such concepts should be the realization that they \r\nare social variables that are very difficult to entrench outside the context \r\nof interaction with national characteristics, namely, the demographic \r\ncomposition, religious beliefs and cultural values of every people. \r\nCoercion and the projection of specific ready-made models of democracy \r\nwill create nothing but tensions and will lead to nothing but social \r\nimbalance. Proceeding from this, wisdom demands that the international \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n17 \r\n(Mr. Al-Hadad. Yemen) \r\ncommunity, while trying to enhance the principles of democracy, should \r\nencourage the adoption of democracy in every country without imposing any \r\nready-made models. \r\nIn any case, we need to generate consensus regarding the model that we \r\nassume would be applied in an absolute manner. However, this conclusion does \r\nnot preclude other endeavours by the human mind to search for alternative \r\nmodels that may be applicable to all. None the less, unanimity can be \r\nachieved through the effective means of promoting the concepts of democracy \r\nand human rights as being indispensable to shouldering international \r\nresponsibility with regard to the socio-economic-development process and as \r\nbeing the pillars for enhancement of the democratic process. \r\nIn this context, we must expand the concept of international security to \r\ninclude action to deal with matters related to the elimination of racism and \r\nthe dismantling of apartheid as well as with the dangers of pollution of the \r\nenvironment. Most importantly, we must deal with the causes of disputes and \r\nwars that are still rampant in the world. All of these matters should be \r\ndealt with on the basis of collective responsibility and through the promotion \r\nof equitable socio-economic development. \r\nThe role of the United Nations is growing in this period of transition in \r\ninternational affairs. While that role has been enhanced, the importance of \r\nthe Organization\u0027s being a model of democratic practice would be clearly \r\ndemonstrated by an approach of consultation and by the participation of \r\nMembers in decision-making, which would produce the balance that is necessary \r\nto revitalize the role of the General Assembly and the nature of its links \r\nwith the Security Council. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n18 \r\n(Mr. Al-Hadad. Yemen) \r\nWith regard to issues relating to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security, the Organization must demonstrate its credibility. The litmus \r\ntest is the avoidance of duplicity and double standards, and full compliance \r\nwith the provisions of the Charter when it comes to matters that may be \r\nregarded as breaches or violations of international peace and security. \r\nWe do not know what course the transformations of the present era will \r\ntake, and we do not deny the increasing interdependence or the common \r\ninterests of us all. However, by entrenching the conviction that democracy \r\nmust be enhanced and that human rights must be upheld, we should be adopting \r\nas our guide the principle of national sovereignty and non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of other countries. This should be protected by the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and by the rules of international law. \r\nIn this connection, the role that ought to be played by the United \r\nNations in respect of collective security and preventive diplomacy with a view \r\nto prevent disputes or to de-escalate them and prevent them from deteriorating \r\ninto conflicts, as well as in respect of all questions of peace-keeping and \r\npeacemaking, should not be allowed to become a vehicle for violation of the \r\nCharter or for the adoption of resolutions in a selective manner. \r\nIn conclusion, I should like to say that my delegation agrees with the \r\nthis comment by the Secretary-General in the report that is under discussion: \r\n\"The principles of the Charter must be applied consistently, not \r\nselectively, for if the perception should be the latter, trust will wane \r\nand with it the moral authority which is the greatest and most unique \r\nquality of that instrument.\" (A/47/277, para. 82) \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n19-20 \r\nMr• ELARABY (Egypt): I wish to begin by conveying the appreciation \r\nand gratitude of my delegation to the President and to all those who have \r\nexpressed kind sentiments of sorrow following the tragedy that struck Cairo \r\nand other parts of Egypt last Monday. \r\nAlmost 50 years ago the international community collectively decided to \r\nestablish the United Nations as an instrument to maintain peace and to ensure \r\na more just, peaceful and humane international order. Many consider that the \r\nrecord of our Organization falls short of the original expectations. \r\nI do not intend to dwell on the reasons behind the inability of the \r\nUnited Nations to fulfil the vision of its founding fathers; what is relevant \r\nto our deliberations now, and what I wish to emphasize, is that we must seize \r\nevery available opportunity to redirect and rededicate our course towards \r\nachieving the fundamental objectives of the United Nations. The international \r\nclimate now is propitious, the political will now seems to exist, and we have \r\nbefore us the Secretary-General\u0027s report \"An Agenda for Peace\" a \r\nthought-provoking document that focuses attention on the issues that could \r\ndetermine the future role of the United Nations. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n21 \r\n(Mr. Elaraby. Egypt) \r\nThe United Nations by way of trial and error was forced to undergo many \r\nchanges in a pragmatic, piecemeal and sometimes improvised manner. The \r\npressure of circumstances dictated that the United Nations membership abandon \r\nsome of the original Charter concepts and seek ways and means to adjust to the \r\nfuture reguirements of the international community. As long ago as 1959 the \r\nlate Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjold, recognized the inevitability of \r\nchange to cope with the dilemma confronting the United Nations. In his 1959 \r\nintroduction to the annual report he wrote the following: \r\n\"The statement of objectives in the Charter is binding and so are the \r\nrules concerning the various organs and their competence, but it is not \r\nnecessary to regard the working methods indicated in the Charter as \r\nlimitative in purpose. Thus, they may be supplemented by others under \r\nthe pressure of circumstances and in the light of experience if these \r\nadditional procedures are not in conflict with what is prescribed.\" \r\n(A/4132/Add.l. p. 2) \r\nI believe what he wrote more than 30 years ago is as valid today. The working \r\nmethods contained in the Charter have indeed taken a turn away from the \r\noriginal plan. \r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s report, \"An Agenda for Peace\", is a valuable and \r\ntimely document. It offers a genuine opportunity for Member States to revisit \r\nthe Charter and reflect on the adequacy of the existing working methods as \r\nDag Hammarskjold asked us to do more than 30 years ago. We should launch an \r\nin-depth, comprehensive study of \"An Agenda for Peace\". The scope of the \r\nstudy should not be confined only to the proposals therein. We should reach \r\nout and analyse all the dimensions and implications that will result from the \r\nimplementation of the various proposals. The Charter is essentially based on \r\na comprehensive, multidimensional concept of security. However, owing to \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n22 \r\n(Mr. Elarabv. Egypt) \r\ncold-war conditions the politico-military aspect of security took precedence \r\nover all other aspects. The Secretary-General in his report has succeeded in \r\nrecapturing the original comprehensive concept of security, with its economic, \r\npolitical, environmental, humanitarian and military dimensions. \r\nEgypt supports an increased role for the United Nations in the fields of \r\npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-building. \r\nActivities of the United Nations in these areas should be based on the \r\nPurposes and Principles of the Charter and respect for the sovereignty, the \r\nterritorial integrity and independence of States. The maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security cannot be achieved if the United Nations role \r\nis confined to tackling a crisis after its eruption. Anticipation of \r\npotential threats and timely action by the United Nations is imperative and \r\nshould be accorded the utmost priority. Furthermore, the United Nations \r\nshould endeavour to settle international disputes peacefully according to \r\nChapter VI taking into consideration Article 36(3) of the Charter, which \r\nstipulates that legal disputes should, as a general rule, be referred by the \r\nparties to the International Court of Justice. The provisions of Chapter VII \r\ncould and should be applied in specific situations when international peace \r\nand security is threatened and the circumstances warrant recourse to these \r\nprovisions. In this context it is relevant and timely to point out that \r\nserious consideration should be devoted to the right of States, confronted \r\nwith special economic problems, in accordance with the provisions of \r\nArticle 50, to consult and seek remedial measures from the Security Council. \r\nFurthermore, the Secretary-General should be encouraged to exercise the \r\nresponsibilities conferred upon him in Article 99 of the Charter. In \r\naddition, it is of the utmost importance in our contemporary world that the \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n23 \r\n(Mr. Elaraby. Egypt) \r\nSecretary-General, on his own authority and as a corollary to Article 99, \r\nutilize fact-finding missions, dispatch observers, and use his good offices as \r\na means of strengthening his ability to contribute positively in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In short, the report \r\ncontains many commendable proposals. While we support the thrust of these \r\nproposals, it should be emphasized that they must be considered against the \r\nbackdrop of the changes that are taking place in the international system, \r\nparticularly what seems to be an increasingly undefined line that \r\ndistinguishes what is an internal or domestic affair of a State and what is \r\nnot. I have in mind the tragic and chaotic situation in Somalia today. \r\nThe substance of the report \"An Agenda for Peace\", as it deals with \r\nmeasures designed to promote international cooperation towards the fulfilment \r\nof the objectives of the United Nations, clearly falls within the purview of \r\nthe General Assembly. It is for this reason, as well as the necessity of \r\nupholding the principles of transparency and democratization of international \r\nrelations, that the General Assembly should deliberate on the report. It is \r\nour considered opinion that it should be addressed by all Member States in an \r\nintegrated, comprehensive manner that will allow States to pull in all \r\nelements of the security equation. Towards this end we propose the \r\nestablishment of an open-ended working group to consider the report, as well \r\nas any other proposals aimed at enhancing the role of the United Nations in \r\nmaintaining international peace and security. As we are approaching the \r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations the time factor cannot be more \r\nimportant. It is therefore necessary that the working group should work with \r\nthis in mind. As a first stage it would be helpful if the working group could \r\npresent the results of its deliberations to a resumed session of the General \r\nAssembly to be convened early next spring. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n24-25 \r\n(Mr. Elaraby. Egypt) \r\nAn integrated approach to \"An Agenda for Peace\" is essential but not \r\nsufficient; it needs to be complemented by a fresh overall look at the \r\nexisting structures and organizations of the United Nations. The mode of \r\noperation and membership of the principal organs of the United Nations must be \r\nreconsidered and updated if we are to undertake a serious and determined \r\neffort to realize comprehensive peace and security. \r\nThe deliberations of the working group should take into consideration the \r\nlong-term objective of improving and strengthening the work of the United \r\nNations. It should deal with specific proposals in the report. Perhaps new \r\nproposals will also surface during these discussions, and it should either \r\ntake a decision regarding them or direct them to the appropriate forum. \r\nUltimately, these discussions may lead to the reconsideration of the mandates \r\nof various existing committees and subsidiary bodies of the General Assembly. \r\nBefore concluding I should like to support the proposal made by the \r\nUnited Kingdom to create a memorial for all those valiant individuals who lost \r\ntheir lives and made the ultimate sacrifice to uphold the Purposes and \r\nPrinciples enshrined in the Charter. \r\nIn conclusion, allow me to point out that the United Nations was \r\nestablished in 1945, equipped with a Charter embodying universal and enduring \r\nPurposes and Principles. These Purposes and Principles are as relevant today \r\nas they were in 1945. What is needed is to ensure that the course the United \r\nNations follows in the future will lead to the realization of its fundamental \r\nobjectives. That is the challenge we face today. We cannot allow this \r\nhistoric opportunity to be missed. We must harness our collective will and \r\npolitical determination to make our Organization an effective instrument \r\ntowards establishing a more just, peaceful and humane world. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n26 \r\nMr. CASTANEDA (El Salvador) (interpretation from Spanish): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the Central American countries - Guatemala, \r\nHonduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and El Salvador. \r\nFirst of all, may I express our sincerest condolences to the Government \r\nand people of Egypt, through its delegation, on the tragedy that that country \r\nhad just suffered. Central America has often suffered the scourge of natural \r\ndisasters, and we therefore understand the tragedy that has occurred in Egypt \r\nin all its dimensions. \r\nOur participation in the debate on agenda item 10, concerning the report \r\nof the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization and on the document \r\nentitled \"An Agenda for Peace\", is prompted by the experience of our subregion \r\nin the application of the concepts of preventive diplomacy and peacemaking, \r\npeace-keeping and peace-building, which has been regarded as a sui generis \r\ncase in the Organization\u0027s peace-keeping procedures and mechanisms. Central \r\nAmerica considers it to be timely and important to express some views on vital \r\nprinciples that must be upheld in an initiative which, although of general \r\ninterest and deserving the support of the whole international community, must \r\nbe studied carefully in order to adopt the most appropriate procedures and \r\nmechanisms, thus avoiding any action that might not serve the shared interests \r\nof the international community. \r\nFor several decades, as the Secretary-General indicates, there were \r\nobstacles to multilateral action by the Organization aimed at achieving its \r\npurposes international peace and security and the promotion of development. \r\nThese obstacles resulted from the prevailing conditions in international \r\nrelations, characterized basically by confrontation between two different \r\nideological, economic and political systems, each eager to make its own \r\nauthority and its security concepts prevail. These factors were compounded by \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n27 \r\n(Mr. Castaneda. EI Salvador) \r\nnegative structural economic and social conditions in a large majority of \r\ndeveloping countries, generating instability and conflict and endangering \r\ninternational peace and security, a situation that was reflected in the United \r\nNations. \r\nWith the cold war at an end, the present decade has begun with an \r\nencouraging outlook, because of the spirit of cooperation and the \r\nstrengthening of multilateralism. We welcome the range of ideas and proposals \r\ncontained in the reports of the Secretary-General aimed at improving the \r\nefficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations so that it can respond \r\nappropriately to old and new challenges that threaten to increase instability \r\nin the international community, not only for political or security reasons or \r\nbecause of the arms race, but also because of new rivalries and the further \r\ndeterioration of the living conditions of many peoples in the developing world. \r\nWe hope that this initiative, aimed at the renewal and revitalization of \r\nthe world Organization so that it can contribute with greater strength to the \r\nbuilding of peace and of a safer world, will come to fruition with the \r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, because there is an evident \r\nconfidence and commitment on the part of States, particularly the members of \r\nthe Security Council, which declared at their Summit Meeting on 31 January \r\nthis year their commitment to cooperate closely with the Secretary-General in \r\nthe attainment of his objectives, including that of improving the \r\neffectiveness and efficiency of the United Nations system. That means \r\nresponding adequately with regard to the financial requirements created by the \r\nincrease in United Nations activities and respect for the principles of \r\ninternational law and of the Charter in resolving international disputes. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n28 \r\n(Mr. Castaneda. El Salvador) \r\nThere can be no doubt that the responsibilities of our Organization have \r\nincreased as they have evolved over time, and we are aware of the scope and \r\nvariety of the complex tasks that it has to carry out today. That is why its \r\ninstitutional restructuring, within a concept of globalization, must be \r\naccomplished with a sense of responsibility and a shared commitment to \r\ninternational cooperation and solidarity, with the full participation of all \r\nStates, based on the principle of sovereign equality recognized in the Charter. \r\nIn this context, we believe that some matters need to be reaffirmed. The \r\nfirst is that institutional restructuring presupposes democratization, which \r\nmeans achieving a balance and harmony of responsibilities in the quest for \r\npeace, both between the General Assembly and the Security Council and between \r\nthem and the Secretariat. This also applies to other organs of the system, \r\nincluding the Economic and Social Council, because of the contributions that \r\nthey can make to the attainment of the objectives. \r\nSecondly, it should be taken into account that, although there is a \r\ntendency to form large blocs a source of concern, because of the possible \r\nharm to the interests of the developing countries the State still plays a \r\ncentral role in the changes taking place in the world order. This means that \r\nrespect for sovereignty and for the right of peoples to govern themselves \r\nfreely and democratically, and the principles of territorial integrity and \r\nnon-intervention in internal affairs, remain fully valid as preconditions for \r\ngreater harmony in inter-State relations. \r\nThirdly, intergovernmental regional organizations should be more involved \r\nin the process of seeking peace and development, with coordination based on \r\nUnited Nations guidelines. Non-governmental organizations that already have \r\nan infrastructure allowing them to shoulder greater responsibilities should \r\nalso be involved. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n29-30 \r\n(Mr. Castaneda. El Salvador) \r\nFourthly, we agree with the Secretary-General that the United Nations \r\nmust be an institution that inspires confidence. As we see it, this means \r\nthat its activities and decisions must display transparency, integrity and \r\nindependence, so that its principles can be applied uniformly and \r\nimpartially. Only to the extent that Member States feel that the United \r\nNations responds to shared concerns and interests will a consensus be reached \r\nto support explicitly and unconditionally the proposed ways and means of \r\nachieving peace. Failing this, distrust will rule, and the capacity of the \r\nUnited Nations will be weakened. \r\nFifthly, any activities undertaken by the United Nations to restore \r\npeace in particular, those involving economic sanctions or the use of \r\nmilitary force - must be in strict compliance with the provisions and \r\nmechanisms contained in the Charter. The scope and objectives of any \r\npeace-keeping operation must be clearly and specifically established in order \r\nto avoid in every way possible the Organization\u0027s losing control over its \r\nactivities. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n31 \r\n(Mr. Castaneda. El Salvador) \r\nWe might point out that the globalization of situations and \r\ninterdependence render obsolete and outdated the era of unilateral \r\nproblem-solving, an effort that was often based on the use of force. On the \r\ncontrary, it is now possible to develop more constructive action based on \r\ndialogue, consultation and harmonization, since there is a consensus among \r\nMember States that our Organization should be the harmonizing centre, as it is \r\nthe only organization with a universal dimension that can make it a collective \r\ninstrument capable of confronting global problems in all their dimensions. \r\nIn this respect we share the Secretary-General\u0027s view on the Security \r\nCouncil as expressed in his \"Agenda for Peace\": \r\n\"A genuine sense of consensus deriving from shared interests must govern \r\nits work, not the threat of the veto or the power of any group of \r\nnations.\" (A/47/277, para. 78) \r\nThe conflict in Central America, in particular in Nicaragua and \r\nEl Salvador, was not invented by anyone; rather, it emerged as a manifestation \r\nof grave shortcomings and errors within our societies. However, once \r\nunleashed it assumed the characteristics of an international conflict, and \r\nthis caused it to be prolonged, with all the results. This also created \r\nspecial cases in which our Organization, upon the request of the States \r\nconcerned, and without violating the provisions and procedures of the Charter, \r\nadopted innovative measures and mechanisms to respond appropriately to each \r\nspecific situation on the basis of, and following up on, the Esquipulas II \r\nAgreements signed by the Presidents of the region. These are clear examples \r\nthat enrich the experience and the record of the United Nations in the sphere \r\nof peacemaking and peace-keeping. But reality shows that the structure of the \r\ncrisis, shared by the great majority of the developing countries, still \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n32 \r\n(Mr. Castaneda. El Salvador) \r\nexists. This allows room for the application of preventive diplomacy and \r\npeace-building measures. \r\nIn this context, and recalling that it is acknowledged that peace and \r\ndevelopment are closely related and interdependent, it is vital that the \r\nsolution to the grave economic and social problems suffered by millions of \r\nhuman beings be given appropriate priority so that sustainable, fair and \r\nequitable development can be integrated into the agenda for peace as a basic \r\nobjective of preventive diplomacy, or of peace-building, as appropriate, in \r\norder to avoid and eliminate the roots of violence and the conflicts caused by \r\nextreme poverty, hunger, illiteracy and so on. \r\nConsequently, and given the failure of tested models of development, in \r\nparticular in the poor countries, to overcome stagnation and economic \r\nbackwardness, as well as on the basis of the mandated responsibility of the \r\nUnited Nations, we share the opinion of the Secretary-General that \r\n\"In the new climate of international relations, we must not miss the \r\nopportunity to develop the necessary international consensus and policy \r\ninstruments and also to adapt United Nations structures, and \r\ninteractions within the United Nations system - to promote this \r\nintegrated approach\" (A/47/1, para. 68) \r\nto development. \r\nStill in the context of preventive diplomacy, we consider that the \r\nInternational Court of Justice is a mechanism that should increasingly be used \r\nby Member States to resolve disputes by peaceful means. This would contribute \r\nto generating greater credibility and confidence in the system and logically \r\nwould strengthen the objectives of the Secretary-General\u0027s \"Agenda for Peace\", \r\nparticularly if there exists the political will to comply with the rulings of \r\nthe International Court. It is appropriate to mention that El Salvador and \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n33 \r\n(Mr. Castaneda. El Salvador) \r\nHonduras placed their trust in the Court to resolve an old border dispute, and \r\nwe are now at the stage of implementing the ruling. \r\nIn conclusion, we are pleased to see that there is a widely held view \r\nthat we are now in a special period that offers an opportunity for the renewal \r\nof multilateralism. We agree that the reports of the Secretary-General, in \r\nparticular the \"Agenda for Peace\", as we have already said, deserve further \r\nthought and more profound consideration in order to attain a consensus on the \r\nmost appropriate ways and means of achieving the objectives of international \r\npeace and security. We reaffirm the appropriateness of the suggestion that \r\nthe General Assembly establish an open-ended working group for this purpose, \r\nbut this should not be at any additional cost to the Organization. \r\nIt is our hope that the expressions of faith in and support of the United \r\nNations will be reflected in concrete acts for the benefit of the \r\ninternational community, in which the solution of global problems requires the \r\nparticipation and full cooperation of all Members. \r\nMr. KHARRAZI (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the outset I express my \r\nsincere condolences and sympathy to the people of Egypt on the recent \r\ndisastrous earthquake. \r\nThe winds of change are sweeping the world and gaining increasing \r\nmomentum as nations and States try to adjust themselves, seize the new \r\nopportunities and face the new challenges that are simultaneously being \r\npresented in the post-cold-war era. \r\nThe reports of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization and \r\non \"An Agenda for Peace\" reflect the resolve of our new Secretary-General to \r\ntake stock of the opportunities regained in the new international era, not \r\nonly to revitalize the United Nations system to correspond to new demands, but \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n34-35 \r\n(Mr. Kharrazi. Islamir \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\nalso to be able to function as an efficient, versatile and strong world body \r\nthat truly represents all nations and is capable of shaping the future in the \r\ninterests of justice, peace and the common prosperity of mankind. My \r\ndelegation wishes to express its sincerest appreciation to His Excellency \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali and his able staff in the Secretariat for these \r\nreports. \r\nWe have noted with interest that the Secretary-General has indicated in \r\nthese reports that the United Nations system is being revitalized to focus on \r\nthe following areas: global partnership for development; management of crisis \r\nand humanitarian assistance; and maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" contains a series of new ideas and innovative \r\nproposals aimed at building a stronger and more effective United Nations in \r\nvarious areas of international peace and security. The Islamic Republic of \r\nIran agrees with the Secretary-General that political progress and economic \r\ndevelopment are inseparable, equally fundamental and mutually reinforcing, \r\nwhich must be pursued simultaneously. Thus, in our view the United Nations \r\nshould adopt such an integrated approach if we are to seize the opportunity \r\nregained for the materializing of the ultimate objectives of the United \r\nNations that is, to employ international machinery for the promotion of the \r\neconomic and social advancement of all peoples and to promote social progress \r\nand better standards of life in larger freedom. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n36 \r\n(Mr. Kharrazi. Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\nAs the representative of a developing country, one that is also a member \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement, I wish to say that my Government sees a shining \r\nray of hope that the United Nations will make a rational choice at this \r\njuncture and adopt a course of action for the future that is marked by a \r\nbalanced and integrated approach to international security, on the one hand, \r\nand to economic development and social progress on the other. In this \r\ncontext, we have studied the Secretary-General\u0027s report \"An Agenda for Peace\" \r\n(A/47/277), and we anxiously await his report \"An Agenda for Development\". We \r\nfeel strongly that the international climate in which to address the \r\nNorth-South problem has never been as conducive as it is now. Therefore, in \r\nour view the decision of the Rio Summit to establish the Commission on \r\nSustainable Development constitutes a substantial and encouraging step in the \r\nright direction. \r\nHaving said this, I should like to make some general observations \r\nconcerning \"An Agenda for Peace\" and leave the detailed and in-depth \r\ndeliberation of the ideas and proposals to an open-ended working group of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which we hope the President will establish. \r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" elaborates on the role of the Security Council and \r\nthe Secretary-General in maintaining international peace and security in terms \r\nof preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping, and post-conflict \r\npeace-building. Each chapter includes proposals that may require consensus, \r\nas well as some that will need to be further studied, better defined and \r\nelaborated. The General Assembly, as a truly universal body whose conduct of \r\nwork is most transparent within the United Nations, is thus uniquely qualified \r\nto identify and distinguish between the two sets of proposals. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Kharrazi. Islamir \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran believes that the role of the General \r\nAssembly in issues pertaining to international peace and security has not yet \r\nbeen fully explored. We therefore welcome the suggestions in the report aimed \r\nat achieving a better balance among the principal organs of the United \r\nNations. In our view, the role of the General Assembly, the truly universal \r\nbody of the Organization, as the forum for deliberation and decision-making on \r\nall issues of a global character including the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, should be strengthened and given prominence in the \r\nfollow-up deliberations on \"An Agenda for Peace\". The strengthening of the \r\nOrganization should take place within the functions and responsibilities \r\nassigned to each of the principal organs and, in this context, the time is \r\nripe for the General Assembly to assume its major role, in accordance with the \r\nCharter, in dealing with issues concerning the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. \r\nIn this connection. Dr. Ali Akbar Velayati, the Foreign Minister of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, speaking in the general debate this year, emphasized \r\nthat: \r\n\"... the preservation of international peace and security is a \r\nresponsibility entrusted to the Security Council by the international \r\ncommunity. That being the case, the Council, in accordance with the \r\nCharter, is accountable to that community, which is represented by the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\" (A/47/PV.5. p. 48) \r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" elaborates extensively on the role of the Security \r\nCouncil with respect to such innovative ideas as the various types of \r\npreventive deployment, the use of military force and peace-enforcement units. \r\nWe have already noted the unprecedented expansion of the Security Council\u0027s \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n38 \r\n(Mr. Kharrazi. Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\nactivities. The quantitative comparison of the workload of the Security \r\nCouncil in the first seven months of 1992 and all of 1987, as reflected in the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report on the work of the Organization, is both \r\nmind-boggling and alarming. It is mind-boggling because it has stretched the \r\ncapacity of the United Nations system to the limit. It is alarming because it \r\nrequired a great deal of trust and confidence on the part of the international \r\ncommunity to be placed in the Security Council, particularly on the permanent \r\nmembers. And there is more. The new international climate is perceived to \r\nrequire an even greater role for the Security Council and a further expansion \r\nof the scope of its mandate. \r\nThe prospect of such a greater role and expanded agenda for the Security \r\nCouncil would be frightening if an equally energetic process for its \r\nresponsiveness and accountability to the general membership, and also the \r\ntransparency of its work, did not begin in the Council particularly on the \r\npart of the permanent members. \r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran concurs with the Secretary-General\u0027s view \r\nthat: \r\n\"the principles of the Charter must be applied consistently, not \r\nselectively, for if the perception should be of the latter, trust will \r\nwane and with it the moral authority which is the greatest and most \r\nunigue quality of that instrument.\" (A/47/277, para. 82) \r\nRegrettably, that has not always been the case in the Security Council. My \r\nForeign Minister enumerated some examples of the selective approach of the \r\nSecurity Council in applying the principles of the Charter. Those examples \r\nwere by no means exhaustive, and included the decades-old aggression of the \r\nZionist regime against the Palestinians and the half-hearted approach to \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n39 \r\n(Mr. Kharrazi. Islamir \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\nSerbia\u0027s blatant aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. \r\nIn our view, the Security Council should strive to gain the trust and \r\nconfidence of the general membership. To do so, the international community \r\nin general, and the general membership of the Organization in particular, \r\nshould be reassured, in practice, of the following: that the Security Council \r\nwill not be the tool for imposing the will of the strong upon the weak; that \r\nthe Security Council will avoid selective and discriminatory approaches to \r\ninternational crises, leading to a condition in which world affairs would be \r\ndetermined by a small group of powerful States; that the Security Council will \r\nrespect the principle of transparency in its work and will become responsive \r\nto the views of the general membership of the Organization; and that the \r\nSecurity Council will not exceed its mandate. \r\nIn the light of those considerations, I cannot over-emphasize the fact \r\nthat the effectiveness of the United Nations in the prevention of the outbreak \r\nof conflicts and in their peaceful settlement, as well as in the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security, is undeniably a function of the \r\ncredibility of its decisions and the degree of consistency with which it \r\napplies the principles of the Charter. \r\nIn the new international era when, as the Secretary-General rightly \r\nmaintains. States perceive the United Nations as an instrument capable of \r\nmaintaining international peace and security, of advancing justice and human \r\nrights, of achieving social progress and better standards of life in larger \r\nfreedom, and also in the light of the increased workload of the Security \r\nCouncil and the expected expansion of its mandate, it would be a dire mistake \r\nnot to seize the opportunity regained to democratize the Security Council and \r\nadjust it to the realities of the 1990s a time in which the general \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n40 \r\n(Mr. Kharrazi. Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\nmembership has increased to 179 States. Specifically, there is an urgent need \r\nto address the undemocratic element of veto power that has led in the past, \r\nand will lead in the future, to influence-peddling by certain powerful members \r\nin the Council. The United Nations of tomorrow cannot afford not to abolish \r\nthe anachronistic veto power. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n41 \r\n(Mr. Kharrazi. Islamir \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\nMy delegation endorses the Secretary-General\u0027s view on cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations. We believe such \r\ncooperation should be strictly in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter, \r\npreserving, in all cases, the primacy of the United Nations. In cases where \r\nregional organizations are involved, in our view the consent of all parties \r\nconcerned is of the utmost importance. In this connection, attention must be \r\ndrawn to the large discrepancy that exists in various parts of the world on \r\nthe degree of coherence and development that regional arrangements and \r\norganizations enjoy. Therefore, the United Nations role in peace-building \r\nshould, in our opinion, include concrete programmes of action to promote \r\nregional arrangements and organizations where needed. \r\nMy delegation also supports the Secretary-General\u0027s proposal to establish \r\na revolving peace-keeping reserve fund of $50 million, provided it has clearly \r\ndefined purposes and is financed through contributions from Member States, \r\nwhether on an assessed or a voluntary basis. While the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran believes that a secure and well-financed United Nations is a prerequisite \r\nfor effective operation, it is of the view that other proposals, such as the \r\nimposition of interest on unpaid contributions, private funding, commercial \r\nborrowing and the levying of a tax on arms transfers, require further \r\nconsideration. \r\nFurthermore, in our opinion, it is essential to institutionalize the \r\ncurrent formula for calculating the scale of assessment for peace-keeping \r\noperations. \r\nIn conclusion, I cannot but remind everyone that the end never justifies \r\nthe means. Some of the ideas and proposals in \"An Agenda for Peace\" have the \r\npotential of being construed in a manner that, in the final analysis, will be \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Kharrazi. Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\ndetrimental to developing countries under the pretext of collective security. \r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran fully subscribes to the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\nstatement that the cornerstone of the work of the United Nations \"is and must \r\nremain the State\" (A/47/277, para. 17). Respect for the fundamental \r\nsovereignty of States is critical in any endeavour on the part of the United \r\nNations. \r\nMy Government firmly believes that revitalization of the United Nations, \r\nwhich has gained significant momentum with the Secretary-General\u0027s report \"An \r\nAgenda for Peace\" and the anticipated follow-up work on the report, must \r\nensure respect for the following principles: sovereign equality of States, \r\nnon-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of States, \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, and the right tc self-determination of \r\npeoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation. \r\nChange is inevitable now. It is our duty to make rational choices in the \r\ninterest of the majority of the people on this planet. History will judge \r\nboth our actions and our intentions. For our part, however small, we are \r\nready to work with Members energetically and in a spirit of international \r\ncooperation to seize the \"opportunity ... regained\" (A/47/277, para. 3). It \r\nis in this context that my delegation proposes the establishment of an \r\nopen-ended working group of the General Assembly to study the report and \r\ndetermine the priority to be given the proposals: early implementation or \r\nfurther consideration. This working group will play an important coordination \r\nrole in the activities of the Assembly\u0027s subsidiary bodies, which have already \r\ninitiated discussion on some of the proposals of the report that relate to \r\ntheir agendas. The General Assembly should gain the relevance and authority \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n43 \r\n(Mr. Kharrazi. Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\nthat the Charter stipulates it should have and should collectively resist \r\nbeing marginalized again. \r\nMrs. HEPTULLAH (India): The year 1992 represents an epochal phase \r\nin the history of the United Nations. Thirteen more nations have joined the \r\nOrganization, making it near-universal. In keeping with the spirit of the \r\ntimes, we have received two reports, \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277) and the \r\nannual report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/47/1), which, in large part, contains an agenda for development. These \r\nreports embody the Secretary-General\u0027s vision of an international society in \r\nwhich mankind lives in peace and harmony and is able to devote its energies \r\nfully to the attainment of the goals of peace, economic and social growth, and \r\ndevelopment. I extend my deep appreciation to the Secretary-General for these \r\nreports. \r\nIt may be recalled that the Secretary-General\u0027s report on preventive \r\ndiplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping was prepared pursuant to the request \r\nmade by the meeting of the Security Council at the summit level on \r\n31 January 1992, and its purpose is to strengthen the capacity of the United \r\nNations in the maintenance of international peace and security within the \r\nframework and provisions of the Charter. It was the express wish of the \r\nsummit meeting of the Security Council that the report should be submitted to \r\nall the Members of the United Nations. It is therefore appropriate that this \r\ndebate should take place in the General Assembly concurrently with the work \r\nbeing done in the other relevant bodies of the United Nations. \r\nThe \"Agenda for Peace\" contains several valuable and practical \r\nrecommendations on preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and \r\npost-conflict peace-building. Together, these and the proposals contained in \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n44-45 \r\n(Mrs. Heptullah. India) \r\nthe annual report on development of the developing countries form the \r\nframework of a peaceful, stable and vibrant international system. \r\nThe principles of the Charter provide the bedrock foundation for the \r\nfunctioning of the Organization. These principles have well served the \r\ninternational community until now and must be faithfully adhered to in all the \r\nfuture work of the Organization. A basic criterion in examining the proposals \r\ncontained in the report \"An Agenda for Peace\" should be that they are in full \r\nconformity with the spirit of the Charter. Given such a consideration, my \r\ndelegation believes that many of these recommendations can be implemented \r\nwithout much delay. These recommendations therefore deserve immediate and \r\ndetailed consideration by the international community. \r\nThe report also contains several proposals for a strengthened and \r\nreinvigorated United Nations that can more effectively fulfil its complex and \r\nmultifaceted tasks in establishing and promoting international peace and \r\nsecurity. Such proposals, which are in accordance with the principles of the \r\nCharter, can contribute to the credibility and impartiality of the United \r\nNations and the confidence of Member States in the capabilities of the \r\nOrganization. My delegation supports the Secretary-General in his endeavours \r\nand will continue to work actively with him in the achievement of these goals. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n46 \r\n(Mrs. Heptullah. India) \r\nThe Secretary-General has made many concrete proposals in the chapter on \r\npeace-keeping. These include recommendations to the Member States to inform \r\nthe Secretariat on the kind and number of skilled personnel they would be able \r\nto make available to the United Nations as the need for new operations \r\narises. The Secretary-General has also recommended that arrangements be \r\nreviewed and improved for training civilian, police or military peace-keeping \r\npersonnel. Yet another recommendation by the Secretary-General calls for the \r\nestablishment of a pre-positioned stock of basic peace-keeping equipment so \r\nthat some vehicles, communications equipment, generators, and so on, would be \r\nimmediately available at the start of an operation. The report also calls \r\nupon Governments to consider the option of keeping some equipment on stand-by \r\nfor immediate sale or loan to the United Nations when required. These \r\nproposals will contribute to the effective launching of peace-keeping \r\noperations as and when necessary. \r\nWe agree that Member States should undertake to inform the Secretariat \r\npromptly on the nature of personnel and equipment they are prepared to provide \r\nat short notice. I am glad to state that India was one of the few countries, \r\nreferred to by the Secretary-General, to have given this information to the \r\nSecretariat when we were asked to do so some time ago. \r\nWith respect to obtaining equipment and supplies for peace-keeping \r\noperations, I believe that it is also necessary for the Secretariat to observe \r\nthe principles of transparency and cost effectiveness. All efforts need to be \r\nmade to ensure that supplies are procured for United Nations peace-keeping \r\noperations at the lowest cost possible, without compromising the effectiveness \r\nof operations. \r\nIndia, in fulfilment of its responsibilities as a Member of the United \r\nNations, has always been active in contributing to United Nations \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n47 \r\n(Mrs. Heptullah. India) \r\npeace-keeping operations. Our contributions to the operations in the Congo as \r\nearly as 1960 are still well remembered. As one of the foremost contributors \r\nto United Nations peace-keeping operations, India\u0027s personnel have also \r\nsuffered a large number of casualties in discharging their role in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. From this point of view, we \r\nare in agreement with the Secretary-General on the need for devising measures \r\nto ensure the safety and security of United Nations peace-keeping personnel. \r\nThis matter needs the urgent attention of the United Nations so that the \r\nabiding cooperation of all Member nations in peace-keeping efforts is ensured. \r\nThe success of peace-keeping operations depends, in large measure, \r\nupon an assured financial footing. Proposals made by the Secretary-General in \r\nthis regard need exhaustive and objective examination by the entire membership \r\nof the United Nations to ensure that the financial difficulties of the United \r\nNations are resolved without delay and without affecting its credibility, \r\nobjectivity and impartiality. \r\nOne of the proposals made by the Secretary-General calls for the \r\nestablishment of a peace-keeping reserve fund to meet start-up costs for \r\npeace-keeping operations. My delegation supports this proposal and suggests \r\nthat contributions to the fund should be made by States Members of the United \r\nNations, on the principle that financing peace-keeping operations is the \r\ncollective responsibility of all Member States. We also agree with the \r\nobservation made by the Secretary-General that Member States should consider \r\nthe possibility of making their contributions for peace-keeping operations \r\nfrom their defence budgets. \r\nIn the final analysis, the only durable solution to the financial \r\nproblems of the United Nations is the prompt and full payment by Member States \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n48 \r\n(Mrs. Heptullah. India) \r\nof their assessed contributions to both the regular budget and the \r\npeace-keeping expenditures of the United Nations. This will also address the \r\nlong-felt need for the United Nations to make timely payments to Member \r\nnations for their contributions to peace-keeping operations. \r\nWe welcome the proposal made by the Secretary-General in paragraph 41 of \r\nhis report (A/47/277) which calls for devising measures to insulate States \r\nfrom difficulties caused by economic sanctions imposed under Chapter VII of \r\nthe Charter. Over the last two years, the international community has \r\nwitnessed increasing recourse to the provisions of Chapter VII to enforce the \r\nwill of the community vis-a-vis States guilty of breaching international peace \r\nand security and violating the principles of the Charter. While such \r\nsanctions are an important mechanism available to the Security Council in \r\nfulfilling its role of maintaining international peace and security, the \r\ninternational community has also become increasingly aware of the difficulties \r\ncaused for third-party countries by sanctions and the immediate need to \r\nredress the difficulties of unintended victims. Measures under Article 50 of \r\nthe Charter, as suggested by the Secretary-General, should be put in place so \r\nthat mechanisms can go into operation immediately and automatically as soon as \r\nsanctions are imposed. As the Secretary-General has stated, this would \r\nencourage States to cooperate with the decisions of the Council. \r\nThe proposals of the Secretary-General provide a comprehensive framework \r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security, not only by dealing \r\nwith peace-keeping operations but also through a greater vision of an overall \r\nprocess of detecting threats to peace, dealing with them before they turn into \r\nconflicts and the process of rebuilding peace after such conflicts are over. \r\nWe agree that the question of peace cannot be dealt with only within the ambit \r\nof peace-keeping operations and that a more thorough approach to international \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n49 \r\n(Mrs. Heptullah. India) \r\npeace has to be adopted. In this context, all organs of the United Nations \r\nhave their defined role to play. For instance, the dispatch of fact-finding \r\nmissions, peace-keeping efforts under Chapter VI, consultations and \r\nnegotiations with the concerned parties and economic assistance as a way to \r\nameliorate circumstances leading to conflicts are within the mandates of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social Council. These organs should be \r\nallowed to play fully their assigned roles in such efforts. This will lead to \r\na greater efficiency in the discharge of their responsibilities and \r\ntransparency in their actions. \r\nWe also agree with the recommendation of the Secretary-General that \r\nenhanced cooperation between the General Assembly and the Security Council can \r\nprovide a more effective use of the capacity of the United Nations in \r\nresolving conflicts. There are provisions in the Charter, such as Article 15, \r\ncalling for special reporting by the Security Council to the General Assembly, \r\nwhich can be used for this purpose to achieve greater coordination between \r\nthese two most important organs of the United Nations. \r\nA strengthened and vigorous United Nations in maintaining international \r\npeace and security calls for a corresponding democratization of United Nations \r\ndecision-making. The Security Council, as structured at present, is unlikely \r\nto be able to function effectively to meet the increasing needs of the \r\ninternational community in this most important aspect of United Nations \r\nactivities. It is necessary that serious consideration be given immediately \r\nto the question of Security Council reforms to reflect changing realities. An \r\nexpansion of the Security Council will increase its moral authority and enable \r\nit to carry out the enhanced mandate \"An Agenda for Peace\" will eventually \r\ngive to the Council. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n50 \r\n(Mrs. Heptullah. India) \r\nThe Secretary-General states, \r\n\"The foundation-stone of this work is and must remain the State. \r\nRespect for its fundamental sovereignty and integrity are crucial to any \r\ncommon international progress.\" (A/47/277, para. 17) \r\nWe fully support this view. The sovereignty of States cannot be abridged \r\nwhether on the grounds of finding a balance between globalism and nationalism \r\nor on the grounds of self-determination. The right to self-determination \r\nshould apply only to peoples under colonial domination and not to integral \r\nparts of sovereign nations. The sovereign equality of all States, the \r\ninviolability of the territorial integrity of any State and non-interference \r\nin internal affairs are sacrosanct principles enshrined in the Charter \r\nitself. The principle of request by a Member State and consent by all \r\nconcerned parties should be adhered to without exception, whether in the case \r\nof fact-finding missions under the concept of preventive diplomacy or of the \r\ndispatch of peace-keeping operations. Naturally, enforcement measures adopted \r\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter fall into a different category. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n51 \r\n(Mrs, Heptullah. India) \r\nMilitary force as a means of maintaining peace or preventing conflicts \r\nshould be used only as a matter of last resort. The very spirit of the United \r\nNations Charter focuses on building a peaceful and stable international \r\nsociety in which there is a minimal role for the use of military force. It is \r\ntherefore necessary that all peaceful means should be fully exhausted before \r\nconsidering the use of force to prevent conflicts or to make peace. Even \r\nunder circumstances when it becomes necessary to use force, it should \r\ninvariably be under the control and command of the United Nations. This will \r\nenhance the moral authority of the Organization, its credibility as an agent \r\nof peace and the confidence of the international community in such enforcement \r\nactions. \r\nAs I have stated before, the proposals in the Secretary-General\u0027s report \r\ndemand a thorough and detailed consideration by the overall membership of the \r\nUnited Nations. We suggest that a working group of the General Assembly \r\nshould be established at the earliest opportunity to examine the proposals and \r\nto suggest possible courses of action on the recommendations contained in the \r\nreport. Meetings of this working group should be open-ended and led by the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, at least in the initial stages, so that its \r\ndeliberations can be conducted meaningfully and with the attention and gravity \r\nthat the report deserves. \r\nThe maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of \r\nthe economic and social development of the developing countries are two major \r\nconcerns of the United Nations. The international situation has undergone \r\nrapid changes in the last few years, and yet problems of the past, both \r\npolitical and developmental, increasingly afflict many nations. The two \r\nreports by the Secretary-General - the annual report and \"An Agenda for \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n52 \r\n(Mrs. Heptullah. India) \r\nPeace\" - provide a comprehensive framework for dealing with the question of \r\ninternational peace and security and the developmental needs of developing \r\ncountries. Just as economic assistance can be used to mitigate threats to \r\ninternational peace, the development of developing countries, as discussed in \r\nthe \"agenda for development\" in the annual report, plays an important role in \r\nthe achievement of stable international peace and security. \r\nThere are strong linkages between international peace and security on the \r\none hand and the development of developing countries on the other. As the \r\nSecretary-General himself said in his annual report, \r\n\"Political progress and economic development are inseparable: both \r\nare equally important and must be pursued simultaneously.\" \r\n(A/47/1, para. 64) \r\nInasmuch as political stability is necessary for implementing effective \r\neconomic policies for development, the pursuance of such policies inevitably \r\ncontributes to the realization of stable international peace and security. \r\nAs a developing nation, India naturally has as its first priority \r\nimproving the living standards of all its people, policies for which can be \r\neffectively implemented only in the framework of an equitable international \r\neconomic order. The United Nations, with its universal character, is the most \r\nimportant forum for analysis and conceptual formulation of socio-economic \r\nproblems of concern to developing countries. We agree with the \r\nSecretary-General that \r\n\"the Organization\u0027s responsibilities and commitments in the political and \r\nsecurity area should not be carried out at the expense of its \r\nresponsibilities in the development field ... It is essential that they \r\nbe pursued in an integrated, mutually supporting way.\" (A/47/1, para. 66) \r\nMy delegation would in fact go a step further and suggest that realizing the \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n53 \r\n(Mrs. Heptullah. India) \r\neconomic development of all developing countries is an important contribution \r\ntowards ensuring stable international peace.* \r\nMy delegation therefore supports the elements of an integrated approach \r\nas proposed by the Secretary-General in his annual report regarding the \r\neconomic and social dimensions of development; the interrelationships between \r\ntrade, financial investment and technology; the needs of development and the \r\nprotection of the environment; meeting immediate needs for emergency and \r\nhumanitarian assistance; and setting the conditions for long-term \r\ndevelopment. It is the hope of my delegation that the \"agenda for \r\ndevelopment\" will receive as much attention from the entire membership of the \r\nUnited Nations as the \"Agenda for Peace\", and that questions relating to free \r\ntrade, international finances, resource availability and the transfer of \r\ntechnology, which have so far hampered the efforts of the developing nations \r\nto achieve rapid economic growth and development, will be resolved under the \r\noverall leadership of the United Nations. \r\nMr. SY (Senegal) (interpretation from French): When he spoke on \r\n30 September 1992 from this rostrum, which has witnessed so many significant \r\nevents in the evolution of our Organization, President Abdou Diouf, Head of \r\nState of Senegal, warmly and sincerely congratulated the President. He also \r\nexpressed the appreciation of the Senegalese delegation for the masterly way \r\nin which, since his election a year ago to head our Organization, the \r\nSecretary-General has been performing his lofty mission with such competence, \r\nselflessness and effectiveness. \r\nIn his address, which I hope will be an inspiration to the work of this \r\nsession. President Abdou Diouf emphasized and welcomed the important recent \r\n* Mr. Moumin (Comoros), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n54-55 \r\n(Mr. Sv. Senegal) \r\nqualitative changes in the international arena in the fields of disarmament, \r\nthe defence of human rights and peace-keeping, which are also essential for \r\nprogress in international economic and technological cooperation. For that \r\nreason he highlighted the increased confidence being placed in the United \r\nNations and the significant role that it will have to play in constructing a \r\nnew world in which its Member States work together in a spirit of mutual \r\nrespect to bring about international relations based on peace and security as \r\nwell as solidarity and mutual trust. \r\nIn the light of those pertinent comments, which I felt it was important \r\nto recall, it can be readily understood that the Senegalese delegation \r\nattaches great importance to our consideration of the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization, and especially of \"An \r\nAgenda for Peace\", the subjects of this debate. \r\nA careful reading of the documents vividly recalls that historic period \r\nfrom 25 April to 26 June 1945 when a number of States, having learned the \r\nlessons of the appalling consequences of two of the most devastating wars \r\nhumanity has ever experienced, came together in San Francisco to bring into \r\nbeing our prestigious Organization. \r\nSince then, a long road has been travelled and significant progress has \r\nbeen made, including the end of the cold war and a greater commitment of \r\npeoples to their freedom and to their national sovereignty. The framers of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, whose essential concern was to avert the \r\nrisk of tension-and war, surely could not have hoped that in less than half a \r\ncentury so many States - 179 in all would have rallied to their cause and \r\nthat their undertaking would in so short a time have led to such an era of \r\ndetente, albeit one beset by many uncertainties. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n56 \r\n(Mr. Sy. Senegal) \r\nThe framers of the United Nations Charter were undoubtedly also bearers \r\nof a new vision of the world, a world in which there would be a stronger \r\ndetermination to achieve rapprochement between all States. This is more \r\nnecessary today than ever before if the peoples and the nations wish to build \r\ntogether a more secure and prosperous future for present and future \r\ngenerations. The Secretary-General\u0027s excellent report (A/47/1) on the work of \r\nthe Organization provides a striking illustration of that vision of the \r\nfuture, which is the only one that can help preserve collective peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\nI should like to take this opportunity to offer once again my \r\ndelegation\u0027s congratulations and encouragement to the Secretary-General and to \r\npay a tribute to the founders of our Organization and those who drafted the \r\nCharter of the United Nations for their visionary spirit. It is to their \r\ncredit that, above all, they set forth principles and established purposes for \r\nour Organization which, although they might at times have seemed to be \r\nillusory and Utopian, nevertheless have made it possible for us today to \r\nrespond, if we really want to, to the profound aspirations of the peoples of \r\nour respective countries. \r\nThe line of conduct which they traced for us has enabled us to attenuate \r\nthe suffering caused the world by the cold war and by all the tensions and to \r\nhelp in various ways to promote respect for human rights and democratic \r\nprinciples. These are undoubtedly actions that constitute decisive steps \r\ntowards our ultimate goal, which is to create a more just and equitable new \r\nworld order. \r\nObviously, our task is far from accomplished. On the contrary, it has \r\nonly just started, because after having regained its credibility and aroused \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Sv. Senegal) \r\nso much hope, the United Nations is now more in demand than ever before. \r\nThe resurgence of international and regional conflicts, which are a \r\nconstant source of concern and worry to us, is a good indication of the \r\ndimensions of this task and the need to give the Organization the means to \r\nperform it in the most effective way possible. \r\nIt is therefore fortunate that, at the initiative of the Heads of State \r\nor Government of the members of the Security Council, who met in New York on \r\n31 January 1992, the Secretary-General first devised \"An Agenda for Peace\". \r\nThis valuable document contains concrete and pertinent proposals on how to \r\nstrengthen the Organization\u0027s capacities in the spheres of preventive \r\ndiplomacy, peace-keeping, peacemaking and peace-building, and on the ways and \r\nmeans of enhancing its effectiveness in the framework of the relevant \r\nprovisions of the Charter. \r\nAmong the measures proposed in \"An Agenda for Peace\", those which relate \r\nto preventive diplomacy, to peacemaking and to cooperation with regional \r\narrangements and agencies prove on close analysis to be of particular \r\nimportance. In this connection the Senegalese delegation believes that \r\nconfidence-building, fact-finding, the setting up of an early warning system, \r\npreventive deployment and the establishment of demilitarized zones, are an \r\nexcellent basis on which to approach the resolution of crises and the creation \r\nof the necessary conditions for economic international cooperation that could \r\nbetter serve mankind. \r\nThe course to be followed also involves vesting more responsibility in \r\nthe International Court of Justice and resorting to arbitration in the quest \r\nfor peaceful solutions to disputes. The establishment of a system to mobilize \r\nadequate resources to make United Nations humanitarian assistance activities \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr. Sy. Senegal) \r\nmore cost-effective is essential if we are to meet the needs and challenges of \r\nthe present day. \r\nThe proposals on peace-keeping operations also have our full support \r\nsince their aim is to enable the United Nations better to fulfil its task in \r\nthis sphere, in which Senegal has always been a very keen and attentive \r\nparticipant. \r\nWith respect to peace-building, the Senegalese delegation welcomes the \r\ninitiative taken by the Secretary-General to include this element in \r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\". This concept is particularly attractive to the \r\nSenegalese delegation since it implies an obligation on the part of the United \r\nNations to involve itself more in the quest for solutions to the underlying \r\ncauses of conflicts. As we all know, these are generally connected with \r\neconomic and social factors, poverty or specific interests. In other words, \r\nin our opinion the idea of peace-building has the additional advantage of \r\nechoing a deeply felt concern of President Abdou Diouf, for whom the other \r\ncornerstone of peace is development. \r\nPeacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-building are undoubtedly our common \r\nobjective, but it should be amply supported by our determination to create the \r\nnecessary conditions for sustainable development. In the implementation of \r\nthis concept, which was broadly endorsed at the historic United Nations \r\nConference on Environment and Development, held at Rio de Janeiro in \r\nJune 1992, the problems of poverty and underdevelopment, which seriously \r\nthreaten international peace and security, in our opinion can be resolved only \r\nin a climate of generalized growth taking broad account of the concerns of the \r\ndeveloping countries, and with increased participation by those countries in \r\nthe building of this new world. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n59 \r\n(Mr. Sv. Senegal) \r\nThis shared responsibility in the management of international affairs \r\nshould therefore, in our view, be brought fully into play in the framework of \r\nthe peace-keeping operations, by strengthening, as proposed in the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report, cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nregional organizations. Naturally, the Senegalese delegation cannot but \r\nwelcome such a recommendation because it is dictated not only by a laudable \r\ndesire to make rational use of the already too limited resources of the United \r\nNations but also, and above all, by a concern to respect the letter and spirit \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations, particularly Articles 52, 53 and 54 of \r\nChapter VIII. It should be recalled that this Chapter advocates cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the regional arrangements and agencies in \r\nmanaging and resolving crises. \r\nIn this spirit. President Abdou Diouf, on 30 September 1992, in this very \r\nHall, in his dual capacity as current Chairman of the Organization of African \r\nUnity (OAU) and President of the Sixth Summit Conference of the Organization \r\nof the Islamic Conference (OIC), proposed the convening of an international \r\nconference on Somalia, under the auspices of the United Nations and in \r\ncooperation with the OAU, the OIC and the League of Arab States. This kind of \r\ncooperation is particularly necessary in the light of the statement in the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report that from 1945 to 1987 the United Nations, albeit \r\nwith difficulty but certainly effectively, conducted 13 peace-keeping \r\noperations, and since then it has conducted 13 others. \r\nOne of the consequences of this situation has been that the United \r\nNations has had to place greater emphasis on peace-keeping, which is \r\nundoubtedly a noble task but which has the drawback of sacrificing to a \r\ncertain extent the achievement of the economic, cultural and social objectives \r\nset forth in Chapter IX of the Charter. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n60 \r\n(Mr. Sy. Senegal) \r\nIt is precisely because Africa is aware that on its own the United \r\nNations cannot ensure the defence of the world and at the same time promote \r\ngenuine international economic cooperation that Africa took the important \r\ninitiative, of which members were reminded here by President Abdou Diouf, of \r\nsetting up machinery to prevent, to manage and to settle African conflicts. \r\nBy means of this initiative, taken at the twenty-eighth Summit Conference of \r\nthe Heads of State or Government of the Organization of African Unity, held \r\nfrom 29 June to 1 July 1992 in the Senegalese capital, Dakar, Africa\u0027s aim \r\nwas, with the international community\u0027s assistance, to restate its resolve to \r\ntake its destiny into its own hands. Africa is equally convinced that the \r\naspirations of the developing countries to justice, equity, democracy and \r\npeace cannot be effectively met if the specific characteristics of the various \r\nsocieties concerned are not taken into account and if they do not participate \r\neffectively. \r\nFor all those reasons, we believe that the recommendations made in \"An \r\nAgenda for Peace\" are consonant with our own concerns and deserve our closest \r\nattention. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n61 \r\n(Mr. Sy. Senegal) \r\nLike the Secretary-General, the delegation of Senegal is convinced that \r\nall the proposals contained in this document stem essentially from the \r\npertinent provisions of the Charter and can help to prevent any trend towards \r\nunilateralism, as well as to strengthen international confidence and \r\nsolidarity. The need to promote confidence and solidarity fully warrants the \r\nproposal concerning the creation of a general agreement on solidarity (GAS) \r\nan idea mooted by President Abdou Diouf for our consideration. \r\nThis need also constitutes a strong argument in favour of a renewed \r\nNorth-South dialogue, based on a spirit of partnership and shared \r\nresponsibility, in the true interests of both parties. We find this approach \r\nparticularly interesting because any conflict of interests between the North \r\nand the South cannot be of benefit to either side. The world of peace and \r\nprosperity to which we all aspire can be built only if all States work \r\ntogether for the benefit of their populations. \r\nWe must never tire of repeating that the North and the South are \r\ninterdependent and, therefore, condemned to live together. .Their chances of \r\nachieving harmonious economic and social development hinge essentially on \r\ntheir capacity to pool their strengths and their means, as well as the \r\ncreative talents of their peoples, in a genuine spirit of solidarity. Their \r\nchances of establishing lasting global peace and security are especially \r\ndependent on their determination, through peaceful coexistence and joint \r\nendeavours in the service of development, to set aside any threat of mutual \r\ndestruction. \r\nThat is why the delegation of Senegal is profoundly committed to the \r\nachievement of a general agreement on solidarity (GAS), which we believe would \r\nbe the best possible means of meeting the target set in \"An Agenda for \r\nPeace\" - to make available to the United Nations the resources not only to \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Sy. Senegal) \r\nforestall conflicts and to keep, build and strengthen international peace and \r\nsecurity but also to give fresh hope and confidence in the future to the \r\nmajority of those peoples suffering from the detrimental effects of poverty \r\nand squalor. \r\nI cannot conclude this statement without sharing with other Members a \r\nvery wise and very appropriate thought voiced by a prominent figure of this \r\ncentury. Chancellor Willy Brandt may he rest in peace who, as a part of \r\nwhat he did throughout his life in the service of good causes, emhpasized that \r\nthe loss of a human life in wartime was as morally reprehensible as \r\nindifference to someone condemned to die of hunger, thirst, disease or poverty. \r\nHence it will not be sufficient for us to silence the cannons and halt \r\nthe tanks and then consider that we have completed our mission. A great deal \r\nmore needs to be done, because peace is not merely the absence of war. The \r\nreality is that we shall have to convert these frightful machines for the \r\ndestruction of the human race and its environment into tools of production and \r\ninstruments that will help to safeguard the balance of ecosystems. We shall \r\nhave finally to vanquish war, disease, hunger and illiteracy. \r\nIn this way we shall help to alleviate the plight of the disadvantaged \r\nand to avoid despair, which leads to behaviour that is prejudicial to our \r\nendeavours to preserve peace and security throughout the world. In fact, we \r\nreally have no choice. While it is true that there will never be development \r\nwithout peace, it is equally true that peace and security without development \r\nare doomed to remain a pious wish or merely an illusory and fragile dream. \r\nI should like to thank representatives for their kind attention and to \r\ntake this opportunity to reiterate to the delegation of Egypt our deep \r\ncondolences and sadness, as well as our sympathy and solidarity, in the wake \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. Sv. Senegal) \r\nof the recent natural disaster that has so sorely tried its friendly and \r\nfraternal people. \r\nMr. ELHOUDERI (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (interpretation from \r\nArabic): Among the objectives and purposes of the United Nations is the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. To this end, the \r\ninternational community has encouraged initiatives to enhance the role of the \r\nOrganization in this field. Accordingly, the delegation of my country \r\nwelcomes the report of the Secretary-General entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\", \r\nwhich is contained in document A/47/277, as a valuable contribution to the \r\ninternational Organization\u0027s efforts to realize its purposes and objectives. \r\nIt is a timely contribution as it coincides with joint international efforts \r\nto overcome the negative consequences of the cold war and to formulate new \r\napproaches for a secure and stable world. \r\nIn his report \"An Agenda for Peace\" the Secretary-General touches upon \r\npoints that would enhance the role of the United Nation in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security and includes in his report several important \r\nproposals and recommendations, concerning which my delegation would like to \r\nmake some comments. \r\nMy country supports all efforts aimed at enhancing the capability of the \r\nUnited Nations in the fields of preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and \r\npeace-keeping in accordance with the goals and aims of the United Nations \r\nCharter. We emphasize that respect for national sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity, as defined in the Charter, should be the fundamental basis of \r\ninternational relations and of any measures adopted by the United Nations in \r\nthat regard. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n64-65 \r\n(Mr. Elhouderi. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nMy country also supports the call for all United Nations organs to \r\ndischarge their mandates under the Charter. In this context, the General \r\nAssembly should play an effective and practical role in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. Also in this regard, we should like to \r\nreaffirm the importance of coordinating the relationship between the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council. The General Assembly, like the Security \r\nCouncil and the Secretary-General, should play the role defined for it by the \r\nCharter and should take the necessary measures to guarantee the implementation \r\nof its resolutions and see to it that all United Nations organs scrupulously \r\nabide by provisions of the Charter without discrimination or disregard. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n66 \r\n(Mr. Elhouderi. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nProceeding from the fact that a well-balanced and integrated approach \r\nthat would enable all United Nations organs to perform their allocated roles \r\nin maintaining peace and security is the best way to observe the letter and \r\nspirit of the Charter, we support the call for greater reliance on the \r\nInternational Court of Justice and recommend that all international disputes \r\nof a legal nature should be referred to this Court. We should also make sure \r\nthat other organs within the United Nations do not encroach the functions of \r\nthe Court by interfering in the settlement of disputes that fall essentially \r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. \r\nWe also support the call for the Secretary-General to be authorized to \r\ntake advantage of the advisory competence of the Court in accordance with \r\nrelevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nThe Charter has called for regional arrangements in dealing with issues \r\nrelating to the maintenance of international peace and security. Therefore, \r\nmy country supports the call to enhance cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand regional organizations on such issues provided that that is done in \r\naccordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter and that the primacy of the United \r\nNations should be ensured in maintaining international peace and security. \r\nThere should also be agreement by the concerned parties in cases where \r\nregional arrangements and organizations are involved. \r\nThe maintenance of international peace and security cannot be achieved \r\nwithout solving economic, social, humanitarian and environmental problems. \r\nThat is why we support the call for the Economic and Social Council and other \r\nrelated agencies to perform the roles entrusted to them by the Charter by \r\npreparing studies and reports on economic and social developments that may \r\nendanger international peace and security. In our opinion, international \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n67 \r\n(Mr. Elhouderi. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\npeace does not consist solely of the absence of armed conflict but requires \r\nthe promotion of development, the upholding of human rights and the \r\neradication of hunger and poverty in all parts of the world. \r\nRegarding post-conflict peace-building, the Secretary-General submitted \r\nvalid recommendations, including his reference to war remnants as an \r\nimpediment to reconstruction. My delegation expresses its gratitude to the \r\nSecretary-General for raising this question because we, in Libya, have greatly \r\nsuffered from the remnants of war, especially the mines that were planted in \r\nLibyan territory during the Second World War. In addition to the prohibitive \r\nhuman and material price the Libyan people have already paid, these mines are \r\nstill causing death and injury to many people as well as damage to much \r\nproperty. These mines are a great hindrance to our efforts to combat \r\ndesertification and conserve the environment. \r\nEasing the financial situation of the United Nations and safeguarding the \r\nrapid and effective implementation of peace-keeping operations require \r\nproviding the United Nations with a solid base, namely the availability of \r\nsufficient funds. The United Nations cannot perform the role entrusted to it \r\nwithout adequate financial resources. In his report \"An Agenda for Peace\" and \r\nin his report on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General referred \r\nto old proposals and submitted new ones. In order to create a sound and \r\nstable financial base for the Organization, my country deems it necessary to \r\nprepare a detailed study of these proposals. \r\nThe Secretary-General has stressed that, when confronting various \r\nproblems related to the maintenance of international peace and security, the \r\nprinciples of the Charter should be applied in a consistent, non-selective \r\nmanner. We deem it important that this rule should govern all the \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n68 \r\n(Mr. Elhouderi. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\ndeliberations of the United Nations and especially the Security Council, which \r\nis the body primarily entrusted with the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. This means that the Council should steer away from applying the \r\nprovisions of the Charter in accordance with the whims and interests of some \r\nmajor Powers, particularly when it comes to the use of Chapter VII. The \r\nSecurity Council should also make it possible to conduct wider consultations \r\non its draft resolutions. Moreover, the resolutions should be clear and must \r\nbe implemented in a manner free from discrimination and double standards. \r\nThis would serve to maintain the credibility and moral authority of the \r\nSecurity Council while ensuring respect for, and implementation of its \r\nresolutions by Member States, without hesitation or questioning. \r\nThe delegation of my country wishes to refer to the fact that at the \r\nSecurity Council Summit last January, certain delegations stressed in their \r\nstatements that a collective security system could not be dependable in a \r\nsituation in which some States enjoy a veto power in the Security Council. My \r\ncountry, together with many other countries, has often drawn attention to the \r\nfact that the right of veto constitutes an impediment to the enhancement of \r\nthe role of the United Nations in realizing and maintaining international \r\npeace and security. We are pleased that new international developments have \r\nenhanced the tendency whereby many Security Council resolutions are adopted by \r\nconsensus. However, we are not convinced that this trend will guarantee that \r\nthe veto power will not be used again, especially in disputes in which one of \r\nthe parties concerned is a permanent member of the Council. In our opinion, \r\nthe radical solution lies in abolishing the veto right. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n69-70 \r\n(Mr. Elhouderi. Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya) \r\nIn conclusion, the delegation of the People\u0027s Socialist Libyan Arab \r\nJamahiriya looks forward to participating in any action related to the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report \"An Agenda for Peace\". That is why we support the \r\nproposal for the establishment, by the General Assembly, of an open-ended \r\nworking group to assess the recommendations and proposals contained in the \r\nreport and to recommend the ways and means properly to deal with them. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n71 \r\nMr. ARCILLA (Philippines): Allow me, at the outset. Sir, to \r\nexpress, on behalf of the Government and people of the Philippines, our \r\nsincere sympathy to the Government and people of Egypt for the hundreds of \r\nlives lost and property destroyed during the earthquake that struck Cairo and \r\nits environs. As frequent victims of natural disasters, we can well \r\nappreciate the agonizing experience that our Egyptian brothers are going \r\nthrough. \r\nThe Philippines, as a Founding Member of the United Nations, is committed \r\nto the Organization\u0027s central role in shaping and maintaining a framework \r\nthrough which relations among sovereign nations can be geared towards global \r\npeace, stability and prosperity. It is thus with much satisfaction that we \r\nwelcome the reports of the Secretary-General under agenda item 10. We \r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General on his first annual report on the work of \r\nthe Organization and on his report entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\". \r\nMy Government accords both reports the serious study they deserve. We \r\nagree with their basic premise that the time is ripe for all States the \r\nState being the bedrock upon which the United Nations stands to buckle up \r\nfor the task of undertaking a fundamental renewal of the Organization. Now is \r\nthe time to strengthen and make more efficient the Organization\u0027s capacity for \r\npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping, and, in the words of the \r\nSecretary-General, for \r\n\"dealing comprehensively with the economic, social, environmental and \r\npolitical dimensions of human development.\" (A/47/1, para. 9) \r\nAs we do so, it is useful to bear in mind, however, what the representative of \r\nIndonesia, speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, said earlier in the \r\ndebate: \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n72 \r\n(Mr. Arcilla. Philippines) \r\n\"The international community must ensure strict adherence to the \r\nimmutable principles of sovereignty and non-interference, which should \r\nnot be diluted or abridged under any pretext.\" (A/47/PV.37. p. 33) \r\nAs there will be other opportunities during this session to give our \r\nviews on the specific topics covered in the Secretary-General\u0027s first annual \r\nreport, I will limit my present intervention to his path-breaking document, \r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\". \r\nThe Philippines agrees that the easing of tensions and the early \r\ncontainment of conflict situations are the most efficient means of maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security. Effective preventive diplomacy, however, \r\nrequires that an efficient monitoring mechanism is complemented by a \r\nrapid-response capability. In this light, the creation of \r\ngeographically-based divisions within the Department of Political Affairs \r\nappears to us to be a step in the right direction. If supported by \r\nappropriately skilled staff and provided with adequate infrastructure, \r\nincluding access to data and risk-assessments in the hands of specialized \r\nagencies and functional offices of the United Nations, particularly those in \r\nthe field, those divisions could provide valuable early-warning capability. \r\nWe view favourably the Australian proposal that to enhance this capability \r\nMember States should consider the secondment of their experts for the purposes \r\nof creating a rapid-response information network, developing creative \r\nproposals for specific disputes and training middle-level staff in political \r\nanalysis and dispute resolution. \r\nConfidence-building measures, including systematic exchanges of military \r\nmissions, formation of regional risk-reduction centres and monitoring of arms \r\nagreements must, in our view, be more widely and routinely employed. \r\nIntra-regional seminars on security issues, such as the two already held in \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n73 \r\n(Mr. Arcilla. Philippines) \r\nManila and Bangkok, could provide valuable insights and impetus for further \r\njoint action and consensus.* \r\nWider use of fact-finding and good-offices missions, carried out in full \r\naccord with the Declaration on Fact-finding by the United Nations in the Field \r\nof the Maintenance of International Peace and Security and the Manila \r\nDeclaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes, has the \r\nunequivocal support of my Government. \r\nThe Philippines agrees with the Secretary-General that preventive \r\ndeployment and the establishment of demilitarized zones could, in certain \r\ninstances, prove useful in preventing the outbreak of armed conflicts. \r\nMy Government fully supports the Secretary-General\u0027s call for greater \r\nutilization of the means included in the various declarations on peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes. In this regard, the Organization should further \r\ndevelop a capability to undertake \"quiet\" diplomacy of the sort that enhances \r\ntrust, ensures fairness and avoids unnecessary \"internationalization\" of \r\ndisputes. Also, the General Assembly should be more involved in peacemaking \r\nin cases where the weight of the moral authority of the international \r\ncommunity could make a difference. \r\nThe Philippines supports the granting of authority to the \r\nSecretary-General, pursuant to Article 96, paragraph 2, of the Charter to \r\navail himself of the advisory competence of the International Court of \r\nJustice. We agree that the World Court has important contributions to make to \r\npeacemaking, of which Member States should avail themselves. \r\nHaving itself been gravely confronted by special economic problems \r\narising from the application of sanctions under Article 41, the Philippines \r\n* Mr. Elhouderi (Libya Arab Jamahiriya), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n74 \r\n(Mr. Arcilla. Philippines) \r\nsupports the recommendation of the Secretary-General that the Security Council \r\nshould urgently devise a set of measures involving financial institutions and \r\nother components of the United Nations system to cushion affected States from \r\nthe impact of such sanctions. We also support the proposal made by the Nordic \r\ncountries that the Security Council consider initiating a study on the \r\neffectiveness and management of different types of sanctions. \r\nChapter VII measures, by their very nature, always produce grave \r\nconsequences and must therefore be employed only after other means, including \r\nthose in Chapter VI, have failed. It would be most desirable that a mechanism \r\nfor speedy but thorough consultations between the Security Council and the \r\ngeneral membership of the United Nations be put in place to take up proposals \r\ninvolving Chapter VII measures. \r\nThe Secretary-General has called members\u0027 attention to the special \r\narrangements foreseen in Article 43 of the Charter. He also introduced the \r\nconcept of peace-enforcement units. My Government is prepared to participate \r\nin discussions to achieve broader understanding on these matters. \r\nThe Philippines supports the greater involvement by the United Nations in \r\npeace-keeping operations and commends the deepening cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations Secretariat and Member States in this most important work of \r\nthe Organization. We have participated, and continue to participate, in some \r\nof those operations. We too have responded to the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\nquestionnaire on forces that could be employed in such operations, and we \r\ncontinue to reassess our capabilities, particularly in regard to the \r\nidentification of a pool of potential civilian political officers, \r\nhuman-rights monitors, electoral officials, refugee- and humanitarian-aid \r\nspecialists and police, in order to determine what other reources we could \r\nmake available upon request. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n75 \r\n(Mr. Arcilla. Philippines) \r\nThe Philippines shares the concern of the Secretary-General relating to \r\nthe gap between the growing demands for peace-keeping and the wherewithal to \r\nmeet those demands. We are exerting our best efforts, given our own economic \r\ndifficulties, to meet our obligations. We await with keen interest the \r\nproposal by Japan aimed at ensuring availability of start-up resources for \r\nmajor peace-keeping operations without imposing new financial burdens on \r\nMember States. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n76 \r\n(Mr. Arcilla. Philippines) \r\nMy Government considers the Secretary-General\u0027s addition of the topic of \r\npost-conflict peace-building to his report to be most thoughtful, for, after \r\nall, peace takes its nourishment from the flow of decency, civility and \r\nwell-being of all mankind. To paraphrase a passage in the presidential \r\nstatement at the first Security Council Summit, peace and prosperity are the \r\ntwo faces of the one currency of humankind. \r\nThe Philippines concurs with the Secretary-General\u0027s ideas on fostering \r\npeace after conflicts have been resolved. The United Nations and its \r\nspecialized agencies should develop greater coordination in providing \r\nassistance where reguired. We are pleased to note that the Secretary-General \r\nhas been exerting his utmost efforts to achieve more efficient coordination \r\nwithin the United Nations system through the Administrative Coordination \r\nCommittee. \r\nThe Secretary-General has also called for greater cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and regional arrangements or organizations in the field of the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. We agree that more \r\nsubstantive consultations between them could do much to achieve international \r\nconsensus on the nature of a problem and the measures required to address it. \r\nNone the less, such cooperative activities must remain in full accord with \r\nChapter VIII of the Charter: the primary responsibility for the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security should remain with the Security Council. \r\nMy delegation considers this debate to be the mere beginning of an \r\nimportant process of consultations and consensus-building to achieve the goals \r\nset forth in the Secretary-General\u0027s \"Agenda for Peace\", and we are heartened \r\nto note that this may later be joined by a companion agenda for development, \r\nalready outlined in the Secretary-General\u0027s first annual report, which will \r\nextend the reform process to the economic and social activities of the \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n77 \r\n(Mr. Arcilla. Philippines) \r\nOrganization. We support the proposal of our non-aligned colleagues that a \r\nworking group be established to undertake in-depth studies of the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s recommendations. \r\nMy delegation is prepared to work with all other representatives in this \r\nbody on the ways of transforming this our United Nations into a universal \r\norganization true and faithful to the trust we have all reposed in it. \r\nMr. GHAFOORZAI (Afghanistan): The initiative of the Security \r\nCouncil Summit of 31 January 1992 will undoubtedly be marked as a milestone in \r\nthe coordination of the United Nations efforts towards bringing more peace and \r\nprosperity to the present changing and turbulent world situation. \r\nMy delegation congratulates the Secretary-General for submitting a useful \r\nand comprehensive report entitled \"An agenda for peace: Preventive diplomacy, \r\npeacemaking and peace-keeping\". \r\nThe delegation of the Islamic State of Afghanistan has studied with \r\nparticular attention and interest the report of the Secretary-General on \r\nagenda item 10 and would like to make the following contribution to the debate. \r\nThe United Nations has always been a source of expectation for millions \r\nof our world population, especially where poverty, illiteracy and \r\nunder-development, as well as scarcity of natural resources, continue to \r\nthreaten their economic development, prosperity and security. \r\nThe recent substantial positive changes in international relations \r\ntowards the creation of a world more responsive to the needs of the needy and \r\nthe safer and favourable international climate emanating from the collapse of \r\ncommunism, the end of the cold-war era and world-power polarization have \r\nincreased that expectation. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n78 \r\n(Mr. Ghafoorzai. Afghanistan) \r\nTherefore the present favourable atmosphere of peace, understanding and \r\ncooperation, as well as a more responsive attitude towards respect for human \r\nrights and the dignity of man, should be utilized for the purpose of maximum \r\nstrenthening of the effectiveness and usefulness of our Organization, \r\nparticularly where it can prevent conflicts, end conflicts, and remove threats \r\nof conflicts by the early detection of their sources. \r\nIn line with the views and position of the Non-Aligned Movement on the \r\nmatter, it is our conviction that, taking into account the profound political \r\nchanges in the international arena, the necessary substantive change and \r\nreforms in the international economic system, as a result of which the \r\ndeveloping countries can have a fair chance of achieving social and economic \r\nprogress for their peoples, will also have a positive impact on ensuring real \r\npeace and development throughout the world. \r\nMy delegation attaches priority to preventive diplomacy, which is the \r\nfirst step towards avoiding conflicts, and also the first step towards \r\navoiding the disruption of peace and stability. The identification of \r\nsituations, peacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-building efforts, especially \r\nreference to the deepest causes of conflicts, as referred to in paragraph 15 \r\nof the Secretary-General\u0027s report, are of considerable importance. However, \r\nin the view of my delegation the \"Agenda for Peace\" beyond the current General \r\nAssembly should include the identification of risk areas for stability on the \r\nbasis of the following criteria: first, the areas where the principle of \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States is hardly breathing; \r\nsecondly, where people are about to see their right to self-determination and \r\naspirations to democracy strained due to violation of the basic principles of \r\nsovereignty and political independence; thirdly, as a complementary measure \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n79-80 \r\n(Mr. Ghafoorzai. Afghanistan) \r\nfor strengthening the peaceful efforts of the Organization, conciliation \r\nshould enforce preventive diplomacy. \r\nAppropriate conciliation machinery seems to be lacking in the United \r\nNations system. Today\u0027s circumstances and situations may call for serious \r\nconsideration to be given to the idea of creating conciliation machinery, \r\nperhaps under the Security Council or the General Assembly, which would \r\ngreatly contribute towards enhancement of the cause of human security. \r\nFurthermore, the manner in which appropriate provisions are foreseen in the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, and the particular procedure and methods for dispute \r\nsettlement through, inter alia, conciliation, should be taken full advantage \r\nof, and we hope that at the end of the debate the General Assembly will make \r\nspecific recommendations to this end. \r\nFourthly, the principles of national sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity should continue to constitute the basis for the conduct of \r\ninternational relations. The undertaking by the Secretary-General of periodic \r\nconsultations on confidence-building measures with parties to potential, \r\ncurrent or past disputes, with regional organizations, as promised in \r\nparagraph 24 of the Secretary-General\u0027s report, can play an important role in \r\nreducing the likelihood of conflicts between States. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n81 \r\n(Mr. Ghafoorzai. Afghanistan) \r\nConflicts of political origin in the developing countries are always \r\ncharacterized by complexities based on their own characteristics and political \r\ntendencies. The vulnerability of some of the developing countries to the risk \r\nthat conflicts may proliferate beyond their natural boundaries may make it \r\nnecessary for the United Nations to undertake an objective and cautious \r\napproach in dealing with such complex cases. \r\nIn some cases, conflicts, because they involve factors beyond a country\u0027s \r\nnatural boundaries, cannot be dealt with directly by a concerned party. It \r\nmay be necessary, therefore, for the United Nations, in cooperation with \r\nregional arrangements and organizations, to conduct its peace mission through \r\nthe use of preventive diplomacy, conciliation, peacemaking and peace-keeping \r\nendeavours. \r\nRegional arrangements can be useful not only in providing early warning \r\nbut also in resolving or preventing conflicts from spreading. \r\nThe establishment of joint cooperative projects among States that bring \r\nthem together through the development of many beneficial joint programmes, as \r\nexplained in section VI of the Secretary-General\u0027s report \"An Agenda for \r\nPeace\", in the majority of cases deserves support. Though greater attention \r\nneeds to be paid to the political considerations that continue to represent \r\npotential causes of instability, it is the resolution of political problems \r\nthat prepares the ground for the consolidation of projects that brings nations \r\ncloser and builds more viable guarantees for peace and stability. \r\nIt is equally important to refer to paragraph 58 of the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report, which stresses the importance of addressing the \r\nproblem of land mines, tens of millions of which are scattered throughout \r\ncurrent or former combat zones. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n82 \r\n(Mr. Ghafoorzai. Afghanistan) \r\nAfghanistan, a country in which 14 years of imposed war left behind more \r\nthan 10 million land mines, believes that there can be no complete peace in a \r\nland where the population cannot walk freely on its own soil. \r\nWe take this opportunity to draw the attention of the General Assembly to \r\nthe gravity of that problem in Afghanistan. The inadequacy of financial \r\nresources is seriously hampering the de-mining efforts currently being carried \r\nout by organizations in my country. At a time when almost 5 million refugees \r\nare repatriating, hundreds of returnees are being killed or injured by the \r\nnumerous mines that are scattered on the way to their towns and villages. \r\nAgricultural activity, of course, has been seriously affected by the fear of \r\nland mines. \r\nThe creation of a working group, as suggested by the delegation of \r\nArgentina, would be a positive step towards undertaking a detailed \r\ndeliberation of, and thoroughly analysing, the different specific \r\nrecommendations contained in \"An Agenda for Peace\" in the light of the \r\nprovisions of the Charter and of the relevant resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\nAs to the financing of United Nations peacemaking and peace-keeping \r\noperations, we continue to believe that the scale of assessments for the \r\nfinancing of such operations should objectively reflect the capacity to pay of \r\nthe developing countries, particularly of the least developed and \r\ngeographically disadvantaged developing countries. \r\nTwo important aspects of the report of the Secretary-General on the item \r\nunder consideration, in the view of my delegation, are cooperation with \r\nregional arrangements and the role of the General Assembly in securing peace \r\nand stability. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n83 \r\n(Mr. Ghafoorzai. Afghanistan) \r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan believes that the United Nations Charter \r\nnot only does not exclude the possibility of a group of States undertaking to \r\ndeal with a matter that lends itself to regional action conducive to the \r\nmaintenance of regional and international peace and security, but actually \r\nencourages such joint, cooperative efforts. \r\nIt would be timely at this point to mention the usefulness of regional \r\ngatherings and conferences held under the auspices of the United Nations as a \r\ntemporary means of reducing tensions and containing the spread of instability, \r\nparticularly in Asia, where its Members do not enjoy the regional arrangements \r\nthat are in place in Africa and Latin America. This is without prejudice to \r\nthe peaceful role of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, which will \r\ncontinue to act as a subregional organization. \r\nOwing to its historic strategic importance and to the substantial \r\ngeopolitical changes that have recently occurred around it as a result of the \r\ncollapse of communism and the subsequent emergence of independent States \r\nwith many of which we enjoy religious, cultural, linguistic, ethnic and \r\nhistoric relations - Afghanistan believes that its peace and security have a \r\ndirect, positive influence on the security and stability of those countries \r\nand on that of the region as a whole. Continued insecurity in Afghanistan and \r\nin the region could seriously affect international peace and stability. \r\nAs Iqbal, the great poet of the subcontinent, said: \r\n\"The essence of Asia is a moving mixture. \r\nOf that blend, the Afghan nation is the core. \r\nHer tranquillity is Asia\u0027s peace, \r\nHer disturbance is Asia\u0027s turbulence.\" \r\nMy delegation is anxious for the United Nations to remain seized of its \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n84-85 \r\n(Mr. Ghafoorzai. Afghanistan) \r\nresponsibility to see to it that effective measures are taken to ensure a \r\npeaceful and stable Asia. \r\nAccording to the Charter of our Organization, the General Assembly, as a \r\nuniversal forum, has great potential for settling regional disputes and \r\nconsolidating regional political stability, which can have direct consequences \r\non the maintenance of international peace and stability. This potential has \r\nyet to be utilized. \r\nWe agree with the conclusion in paragraph 36 of the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\nreport \"An Agenda for Peace\" that it is essential to promote the General \r\nAssembly\u0027s utilization by all Member States so as to bring greater influence \r\nto bear in pre-empting or containing situations that are likely to threaten \r\ninternational peace and security. However, we believe that the General \r\nAssembly should take the lead in initiating specific peace and stability \r\nmissions in turbulent situations, and that the membership should support such \r\ninitiatives. \r\nMy delegation hopes that the forty-seventh session of the General \r\nAssembly under the presidency of Mr. Stoyan Ganev, will take such a lead in \r\ninitiating decisive and specific actions so as to make full use of the role \r\nthat the General Assembly was assigned under the Charter, for the good of the \r\nmillions of innocent people throughout the world who live in regions where \r\npeace and tranquillity have yet to be achieved, and so that areas of conflict \r\nthat might lead to regional instability can be contained. \r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would be pleased to take part in any action \r\nby the General Assembly towards raising further hopes for the safety, \r\nprosperity and security of troubled areas of the world, areas where currently \r\nthere is no hope for a better tomorrow, for a safer and more peaceful \r\nenvironment or for future generations to live in peace and prosperity. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n86 \r\nMr. VOHOR (Vanuatu): The Charter of the United Nations begins with \r\nthe oft-quoted words, \"We the peoples of the United Nations\". However, while \r\ndeeply concerned with the peoples, their lives and their aspirations, the \r\nCharter in Article 2 explicitly states: \r\n\"Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United \r\nNations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic \r\njurisdiction of any state ...\" \r\nThus the Charter primarily addresses the interaction of nation States. \r\nToday a changed and still rapidly changing world in the economic and \r\nsocial sphere, the environmental sphere and the sphere of international peace \r\nand security demands a new and fresh look at the Charter and the ways in which \r\nthe United Nations functions and responds. Accordingly, we, like others, \r\ngreet the Secretary-General\u0027s important report entitled \"An Agenda For Peace\" \r\nwith considerable interest and appreciation of the vision and foresight it \r\nexhibits. \r\nThe representative of Indonesia, when he spoke on behalf of the \r\nnon-aligned countries, succinctly expressed some views of my own country. We \r\nnow take this opportunity to expand on a few of our own specific views on this \r\nvery important report and its far-reaching proposals. \r\nSeveral issues raised in the report require careful thought and \r\nconsideration, particularly in the light of the very delicate balance between \r\nthe rights of people on the one hand and the rights, duties and obligations of \r\nnation States on the other. \r\nDemocracy within, between and among nations is a sound foundation for the \r\ndevelopment and promotion of peace and social progress in the world. We have \r\nall borne witness to the wave of democracy sweeping over the globe. However, \r\nthat wave of democracy may prove to be deceptive if the current relations \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n87 \r\n(Mr. Vohor. Vanuatu) \r\nbetween nations are not also democratized and do not reflect the sovereign \r\nequality envisaged in the Charter. \r\nEvery country has an interest in international peace and security, and \r\nevery country has the responsibility to help foster and uphold international \r\npeace and security. This is true, no matter how large and wealthy or how \r\nsmall and economically less well situated a country may be. We are one of \r\nthose countries that believe it is not healthy for international democracy for \r\na small group of countries to make all the major decisions involving peace and \r\nsecurity for the entire international community. How can such decisions be \r\nmade, and then supported by all of us, without the benefit of the thoughts and \r\nother possible contributions of all members of the international community? \r\nAll of us have ideas to offer. All of us have abilities which could and \r\nshould be utilized on behalf of the effort to develop international peace and \r\nsecurity. All of us have values, perspectives and points of view that should \r\nbe considered when decisions involving international peace and security are \r\nabout to be made. We thus concur with the very relevant observation by the \r\nSecretary-General that democracy within the family of nations would require \r\n\"... the fullest consultation, participation and engagement of all \r\nStates, large and small, in the work of the Organization.\" (A/47/277. \r\npara. 82) \r\nA very critical issue for my country is respect for the human rights, \r\ndignity and equality of all human beings. For us, human rights, including \r\ntheir very important civil, political, economic, social and cultural \r\ncomponents, are indivisible and interdependent. We see the right to economic \r\nand social development as an essential element of human rights. Thus it \r\nsaddens us to see human rights addressed selectively at the expense of the \r\nlegitimate economic, social and cultural concerns of developing countries. We \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n88 \r\n(Mr. Vohor. Vanuatu) \r\nwould wish to proceed with great caution in endorsing proposals that would \r\nallow overt intervention by developed countries in the affairs of developing \r\ncountries for the selective promotion of certain aspects of human rights. \r\nAfter all, what country, either developed or developing, can claim to have a \r\nspotless record giving it immunity from the scrutiny and even the criticism of \r\nothers when it comes to every dimension of human rights? \r\nWe certainly agree that the international community should not sit idly \r\nby and witness widespread patterns of human-rights abuse. We do not want to \r\nsee innocent people victimized and in some instances even have their \r\nidentities erased. However, we must respect the rule of law even in \r\ndeveloping and fostering international human-rights law; we cannot take part \r\nin a selective infringement of the sovereignty of certain States while leaving \r\nthe sovereignty of others untouched. Many of the proposals made in this area \r\nhave merits. However, they can gain broad international acceptance only if \r\nthey are general in nature and non-discriminatory, and if their provisions can \r\nbe objectively applied in all instances. \r\nEvery nation represented here is very well aware of the historic reason \r\nwhy developing countries, particularly those that have only recently emerged \r\nfrom colonialism, are cautious when it comes to proposals that might be seen \r\nas affecting their national sovereignty. Some have now begun to speak of \r\ncertain limits to national sovereignty as a natural progression in mankind\u0027s \r\npolitical and social evolution. For those of us who have had to struggle to \r\nreclaim our legal, political and cultural identities it may be somewhat \r\npremature to propose potential limits to our deeply cherished national \r\nsovereignty. This is especially true when so many of the historic grievances \r\nof developing countries are not even addressed, let alone resolved. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n89-90 \r\n(Mr. Vohor. Vanuatu) \r\nOn balance, we support \"An Agenda for Peace\". However, we feel that \r\neveryone\u0027s views must be carefully solicited and that we must carefully \r\nanalyse and weigh the potential impact of provisions which could be seen as \r\npotentially restricting national sovereignty. \r\nA/47/PV.38 \r\n91 \r\n(Mr. Vohor. Vanuatu) \r\nTherefore, we join with others in proposing the establishment of a \r\nworking group to study the report. We believe it to be appropriate to assign \r\ndetailed consideration to a working group given that specific mandate. This \r\nwill accord the matter the importance it merits. \r\nIn conclusion, we consider \"An Agenda for Peace\" to be a very valuable \r\ncontribution. We look forward to making our own contribution to the process \r\nwhich will see the ideas contained in the report evolve into useful tools for \r\nthe future growth and development of international peace and security for all \r\ncountries and all peoples. \r\nThe meeting rose at 6.30 p.m. \r\n"
