The aim of this international conference, endorsed by the\r\nGeneral Assembly in its resolution 46/91, is to celebrate this occasion and to\r\nrevieu a set of targets on ageing for the year 2001, This anniversary year\r\npresents a unique opportunity to assess the progress of and obstacles to the\r\nimplementation of the Plan during the past d~cade and to develop a practical\r\nstrategy on ageing for the future.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.40\r\n6\r\n(Mr. RiCbardsgn, Upited Kipgdom)\r\nNearly 10 ye8rs of experience in implementing the International Plan of\r\nAction on Ageing points to a need for a set of tangible targets in relation to\r\nageing. In its resolution 46/91 the General Assembly adopted a resolution\r\nentitled \"Implementation of the International Plan of Action on Ageing and\r\nrelated activities\", urging Member States to identify their specific national\r\ntargets on ageing for the year 2001 and\u0027to incorporate the United Nations\r\nPrinciples for Older Persons. The Principles state that opportunities must be\r\nprovided for elderly people to participate in and contribute to the ongoing\r\nactivities of society. They include access to work, education and training\r\nprogrammes and family community and health care. Older persons should be able\r\nactively to participate in the formulation and implementation of policies\r\nwhich directly affect their well being, and to pursue opportunities for the\r\nfull development of their potential. They should be able tp live in dignity\r\nand ~ecurity, free from exploitation and physical or mental abuse. The\r\nEuropean Community and ~ts member States support these principles and hope\r\nthat today\u0027~ cGIGbrationwl11 ma~k a turning-point in the international\r\ncommunity\u0027s awareDe8~ of the situation of elderly people.\r\nThe dramatic increase in the number and propor~ion of elderly persons in\r\nthe world will not only pose unique opportunities for every society but is\r\nbringing about profound political, economic and social changes. The growing\r\nnumber and improved health of elderly people in the population must be\r\nconsidered in overall social and economic planning. This massive potential\r\nfor ageing in the near future has critical policy implications. We must also\r\nrecognize the skills and ezperie~ce which people ara capable of contributing\r\nto society in lator life, and shape our policies accordingly. Allocation of\r\nresources to ensure income security to elderly dependents, changes in patterns\r\nof consumption and investment, improvements in health care and other\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n7\r\n(Mr. Ricbordson, United Kingdom)\r\ndevelopmental issues, as well as the individual needs .of rapidly increasing\r\nnumbers of elderly people are some of the factors to be addressed. Social\r\nservices should promote the personal autonomy of elderly people as well as\r\nenabling them to stay in their environment. Decision makers must be persuaded\r\nto start anticipating ageing on a massive scale as today\u0027s youth pass through\r\nthe life cycle to old age. Such forward planning is particularly crucial in\r\ndeveloping countries where the number of elderly people is increasing at a\r\nfaster rate than in. the industrialized countries.\r\nThe ageing popUlation is especially important given the resources and\r\namenities reguired for their care. Policies are needed to promote care,\r\nindependence and dignity by developing an appropriate mix of self-help\r\nopportUDi~ies, family and community support and government assistance. The\r\nEuropean Community Decisions of 26 No~ember 1990 and 24 June 1992 designated\r\n1993 as the Year of Older People and Solidarity between Generations. Among\r\nthe objectives of the Year are to bring to public notice the challenges\r\nreSUlting from the ageing of the population and to promote reflection and\r\ndiscussion on the types of change required in order to deal with current\r\ndemographic developments. The measures planned throughout the Community by\r\nMember StateD, the Commission, the European Parliament and older persons\u0027\r\norganizations include intergenerational activities and information campaigns\r\nto combat ageism, promote health and raise awareness of the contribu~ion of\r\nolder people to society. Tho Year will be an occasion both of celebration and\r\nreflection. The good news - longer and better lives - will be celebrated in\r\nexhibitions, festivals and books. What all this means for the rights and\r\nneeds of older people will be addressed in studies and seminars. Press, radio\r\nand television will focus as never before on the concerns and hopes of o:der\r\npeoplo. The Year will provide the starting-point for a wide-ranging, aeriou8\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n8\r\n(Mr. Richordson, Upited Kingdom)\r\ndiscussion OD a number of topics which are hecoming ever more importent wit~\r\nthe aqeing of the population. These include the age of retirement, i.ncome\r\nsupport and the quality and financing of care services.\r\nIt is common knowlodge that women comprise the majority of elderly\r\npeople. We therefore. welcomed the Experts Group Maeting on the intflgrati~n of\r\nageing and elderly women into development which took place in VielllJ),a in\r\nOctober 1991. The Experts Group Meeting recommended that f;mployment poli.ciels\r\nand practices that discriminate against elderly women should be eliminated.\r\nTraining and retraining should be availaDle to enable ageinq and elderly wOlllen\r\nto enter or re-enter the labour force. Research is needed to identify ways in\r\nwhich elderly women contribute to development. Governments\" nron-qovernmental\r\norganizations and the private sector should take maasures to identify and\r\neliminate the exploitation, abuse and neglect of elderly WOlwan, as well as\r\nviolence against elderly women.\r\nThe European Community and its member States ret\\ffirm their support for\r\nthe York of the United Nations Trust Fund for Ageing. We also note with\r\nsatisfaction the establishment of the Banyan Fund Association~ a world fund\r\nfor ageing, under the patt\u0027onage of the United Nations. f~e welcome the\r\ncreation of this Fund, whose main objective is to promote activities that will\r\nenable elderly people to remain independent and to contribute to society in\r\nthe context of the International Plan of Action on Ageing.\r\nI should like to conclude by thanking the Secretary-General, the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly and all those who have participated in these\r\nmeetings. The European Community and its member States will continue to give\r\npriority to the problems of ageing in order to ensure that the fullest\r\npossible assistance is given to those older peo~le who need it and that the\r\nvalue to society of all older people is recoqni,zed.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl4\u0027/PV.40\r\n9-10\r\nMrs. RQHS.CB (Germany) (spoke in Germu; Bnglish test furnished by\r\nthe delegation): Aa Minister for Senior Citizens of the rederal Republic of\r\nGermany, it ls a great pleasure for me to address the Aas8mbly vith regard to\r\nthe concerns of elderly people in the Member States of the United Rations. We\r\nshould take these plenary meetings as an opportunity to rai.e public avareness\r\nconcernin~ the problems, needs and living conditions of elderly people.\r\nThe International Plan of Action on Ageing vas adopted in Vienna in\r\n1982. Ten years later, our meetings today enable us to appreciate this event\r\nand to inquire as to its implementation. For the future, further impetus can\r\nbe given to the realization of this programme. In formulating new objectives\r\nand ~oints of main emphasis of global policy for the elderly, we vill da~e to\r\nlook even beyond the turn of the millenium.\r\nI fully agree with the ezplanations of the presidency of the European\r\nCommunity. It is a pleasure for me to be given the opportunity on this\r\noccasion to make some supplementary remarks and explanations on issues of\r\nnational, European and internatioD\u0026l policy for the elderly.\r\nThe Federal Government feels UDder a special obligation to th. objectives\r\nof the International Plan of A~tion. It met the J.:\u0027equest to e.tabUsh national\r\ninstitutions of policy for the elderly by founding its own Ministry for Senior\r\nCitizens. The setting up of this ministry is a structural response to the\r\npressing soc!o-political challenges connected with demographic development in\r\nGermany.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n..-----,-----------------------~--\r\nAl471PV.40\r\n11\r\nPolicy ideas and objectives on the elderly arc; ~Gflel::t4ltd in a recently\r\nestablished Federal Action Programme for the Eldol\u0027lYII which mervos 8S a\r\ncentral supporting instrument for meeting the target~ of Germau policy on the\r\nelderly.\r\nIn addition to community and Federal Landor m@8sures and projects, this\r\nFederal Action Programme is not only the driving force behind but also a guide\r\nfor socio-cultural services for elderly in our country.\r\nThe Federal Action Programme for the Elderly vas developed in accordance\r\nwith the International Plan of Action on Ageing. The intention 10 to further\r\nexpand the contents of this Plan on a yearly basis. In my opinion, four areas\r\nof main emphasis are: enco~raginq the independence of and 30c1al\r\nparticipation by the elderly; supporting elderly people in need of assistance\r\nand care with a view to their independence; bringing living conditions in\r\nunified Germany into line; and, last but not least, expanding intarnational\r\npolicy for senior citizens\r\nThe Federal Republic\u0027S policy on the elderly, geared to the national and\r\ninternational situations, supports the realization of United Nations global\r\ntargets on ageing for the year 2001, which we are to adopt jointly.\r\nFor Germany, the Federal Government has, on various occasions and in\r\nnumerous documents, set national targets in its policy for the @lderly. A\r\nnational, comprehensive list of targets is currently being elaborated, one\r\nthat must be receptive to the new findings and experience we will gain from\r\ninternational cooperation. I find that our targets ~re, in many respects,\r\ncongruent with those of our neighbouring countries.\r\nBecause of reunification, however, Germans face a special and novel task\r\nin connection with policy on the elderly. Living conditions will have to\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nW471PV.40\r\n12\r\n(~L ..!!~h, Germapy)\r\nunderqo political, ~conoml, ~d social traneform\u0026tions unprecedented in the\r\nworld.\r\nAfter the achievement of political union in 1989 througtl a peaceful\r\nrevolution in the former German Democratic Republic, attainil19 economic and\r\nsocial union its now our main objective. The elderly people Jln the new Federal\r\nLander have gone through a~d ~uff~red under the rule of the National\r\nSocialists, the Second World War and 40 years of dictatorship of the Socialist\r\nUnity Party of GeX\u0027many. Improving their living conditions is one af the\r\ncentral tasks of present-jay Germany\u0027llI senior-«:itizen policy.\r\nAlthough this is 8 talk of national scaps, tt1e differing social and\r\neconomic situations of elderly people in Weet and East Germany is an example\r\nof the continuing division of Europe, I am well aware of the fact that global\r\nimprovement in the living conditions of the elderly in our world will\r\ncertainly be an incomparably more difficult task, one that calls for manifold\r\nefforts and the mobilization of large-scale resources. If, however, we\r\nsucceed in offering people in West and East Germany comperable prospects in\r\nthe foreseeable future, we will also have given a signal OD a small scale to\r\nrespond to one of the global issues ~f ageing. I am referring to the issue of\r\nageing in dignity, irrespe~tive of social environment and regional affiliation.\r\nWe would like to incorporate our national experience end the knowledge\r\no\r\ngained from our policy on the elderly into a supranatlonal framework at a\r\nEuropean and an international level. The motto should be \"giving and\r\nlearning\". On the European Community level, I am working towards a charter\r\nfor senior citizens to become a guide for European policy on the elderly.\r\nThis charter will serve as a useful supplement to the United Nations\r\nPrinciples for Older Perso;ls.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n13\r\n(Mrs. ROnsch, Germany)\r\nThe Federal Action Programme for the Elder1y that I mentioned earlier, as\r\nan instrument of socio-cultural services for the elderly, can also be\r\nconsidered as a measure of development policy at the national level. The\r\ninternational focus of the Federal Action Programme for the Elderly, with its\r\npossibilities of exchange of information beyond borders, points to a framework\r\nlarger than the national l~vel.\r\nSocial participation by the elderly in the community, on a regional level\r\nand against a national and international background, is one of the pill.ars of\r\nGerman policy on the elderly. I therefore intend to provide the elderly in\r\nGermany, when they retire from their professional lives, with many more fields\r\nof activity than ever before. So-called senior citizens\u0027 offices are to\r\nber 3 community contact agencies, where elderly people can obtain information\r\non .u~king a commitment to act as volunteers as well as on collaborating with\r\nself-help groups and neighbourhood action groups.\r\nNever before in history have so m,~y people lived to such a ripe old\r\nage. This findinq also increasinqly applies to the developinq countries.\r\nHowever, this must not be interpreted as a global ttniqhtmare tt • Gerontological\r\nresearch provides us with the knowledqe we need in stimulating our\r\nsocio-cultural resources to meet demands and cope with challenges.\r\nInternational cooperation in research is important in terms of being able to\r\ncoordinate the solutions to the problems. The issue of 8qoinq in the\r\ndeveloping countries will .Iave to be conside~ed in this context even more\r\nintensively in future.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n14\r\n(Mrs. ROnsch, German~)\r\nAn important event relating to policy on the elderly at the European\r\nlevel will be the \"European Year of Older People and Solidarity bet~~en\r\nGenerations\" in 1993. In coordination with all the main governmental and\r\nnon-governmental organizations, the Federal Government will mark that year in\r\nGermany with a number of conqresses and events. In a number of national and\r\nEuropean events, the Year )f Older People will demonstrate the significance of\r\nthe issue of ageing. We want the public\u0027s perception of the elderly to be\r\nmore realistic. We want it to correspond to the way the elderly see\r\nthemselves and want to be seen.\r\nI think it an important and useful measure to involve elderly people as\r\nvolunteers in the building of social and economic structures. The States\r\nreceiving this assistance 6ill benefit from the enormous experience and\r\nknowledge of the older gene~ation~ This will be of particular importance in\r\nestablishing programmes of assistance for the elderly in the developing\r\ncountries and in the fledgling democracies of Eastern Europe. Older people\r\nthemselves can benefit from participating in such measures. They can once\r\nagain participate in society.\r\nThe agreements with o~r neighbouring States on cooperation in\r\nsenior-citizen policy I have already signed, as well as others still being\r\nprepared, include the mutual promotion of cooperation by non-governmental\r\norgan~zations in the field of socio-cultural services for the elderly. The\r\ncollaboration of a broad range of organizations in solving the urgent\r\ndevelopment problems in Eastern Europe is of partiCUlar importance.\r\nConsequently, I very much appreciate that the Centre for Social\r\nDevelopment and Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations Office at Vienna\r\nplans to hold an expert me~ting on the subject \"Support for Age Care Activity\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAJ47/PV;40\r\n15\r\n(Mrs. BOnsch« Germany)\r\nin Eastern. Europe\", in cooperation with Help Age International. This expert\r\nmeeting will represent a useful contribution towards implementing the action\r\nprogr~~ on ageing for 1992 (resolution 45/106), adopted at the forty-fifth\r\nsession of tha General Assembly. It will also provide a forum where we can\r\ndiscuss practical projects and new fields of activity of the United Nations\r\nand non-governmental organizations with regard to so~io-cultu~al services for\r\nthe elderly in the reform-minded States of Eastern Europe.\r\nThe organizational capacities of the non-governmental organizations in\r\norganizing projects and programmes for improving the living conditions of\r\nelderly people need to be expanded. Hence, I am pleased that the\r\nnon-governmental organizations from West to East are exchanging experiences\r\nabout possible solutions tu these p~oblems under the umbrella of the United\r\nNations. In this context, efforts should be made to contribute to the\r\nestablishment of a network of cooperation in the field of socio-cultural\r\nservices for the elderly in the fledgling democracies of Eastern Europe.\r\nWe appreciate the work of the committees where government representatives\r\ndebate the issues relating to agein~ and coordinate their strategies. Germany\r\nwill also continu~to participate in this work constructively.\r\nFinally, I should like once again to touch on our obligations to provide\r\nassistance in Eastern Euro~e and in the developing countries.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl4.7/PV.40\r\n16\r\n(Mrs. ROnsch. Ge~)\r\nThe reform-minded States of Central and Eastern Europe and the successor\r\nStates of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics require our assistance in\r\nbuilding up their democracies and economic systems. The social structures of\r\nthe past which the reform-minded States, with their limited efficiency, have\r\ntaken over from the preceding governments are functioning only to a very\r\nrestricted extent after the breakdown of their totalitarian administrations.\r\nUnless we take account of the social dimension, our forms of assistance in\r\nbuilding up democracy and market economy will therefore be nothin~ more than a\r\nskeleton.\r\nThe material and social living conditions of elderly people who do not\r\nhave any possibility of securing their subsistence level through gainful\r\nemployment have substantially deteriorated. Family structures are breaking\r\nup, and this frequently deprives old people of their last line of support. It\r\nis the weakest members of society, the elderly, who are hit hardest by the\r\nlack of efficient and functioning structures in the social field.\r\nThe objective of the remedial measures emanating from my Ministry is to\r\nenable the reform-minded States to bring up to date the still existing\r\nstructures of socio-cultural services for the elderly or even to build up new\r\nstructures, which is qUit~ in line with the motto \"Assistance towards\r\nself-help\". We want to acquaint the political and social decision-making\r\nbodies of the reform-minded States with the rules and the way of functioning\r\nof modern structures of socio-cultural services for the elderly. I expect\r\nthese measures to have an ~normous and broad-based effect, which will finally\r\nbe to the advantage of the elderly. The new opportunities that present\r\nthemselves are also of extraordinary significance. I am thinking in this\r\ncontext of encounters for old people, exchanges of experience and\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.40\r\n17\r\nkuowledge het~een experts on socio-cultural aervlces for the elderly and\r\n\u0027\u0027It\u0027edis\\\u0027:leminators\u0027\u0027, and the projects which are sponsored by our Ministry.\r\nThe situation of the old in the f19dgling democracies reflects the social\r\nmid governmental atructures th9re. If we succeed in supporting those States\r\nilL improving the living conditions of their senior citizen~, we will also have\r\ncCltntributed to preventing the disappearance of social and cutural values.\r\nIn the industrial nat~ons it is frequently noted with some amazement that\r\nthe age structures of populations are changing rather more rapidly in the\r\ndeveloping countries than in the ,;,ndustrial natiODl!\u003d In the year 2025, morG\r\nthan 70 per cent of people aged 60 years and above will be living in what we\r\ntoclay consider to be develuping countries.\r\nA particular problem is the growing imbalance in the population structure\r\nof the developing countries~ and especially of many African States. The\r\nassistance already provided in this area by the community of the world\u0027s\r\nnations still has to be reinforced. The recently established Banyan Fund\r\nplays an important role he:e. I am partiCUlarly glad to be able to inform tbe\r\nAssenmly that an old age h~me, sponsored by resources from the Fund,\r\ncelebrated its opening in Uganda on 4 October 1992. On this occasion I should\r\nlike to thank Uganda and especially the diocese of Mukono not only for making\r\nthe grounds available but ~lso for ensuring the maintenance of the old-age\r\nhome in the future.\r\nThe Federal Government is Gtrivinq to develop measures and programmes\r\nwhich will give SUppOl\u0027t to the countries of the third world in building up\r\ntheir own social insurance systems. The changes in the age structures of the\r\ndeveloping countries will ~onsiderably increase the need for these kinds of\r\nassistance in the future.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n18\r\n(Mrs. ROpsch, GermanY)\r\nMy country\u0027s development aid policy will in the future increasingly\r\nsupport target-group-oriented Dleasures which are geared specifically to\r\nelderly people in the thirl w~rld. Concrete examples of this are the\r\nestablishment of old people\u0027s nursing schools in Korea and the extension of\r\nopen-door assistance services for senior citizens in Mexico City. In support\r\nof such measures my Ministry will also attend to the issues of cooperation\r\n~ith less developed States to a still larger extent than has been the case in\r\nthe past.\r\nIn this context wete~l that we have a share of the responsibility for\r\ncreating a world of peace for the fair and equal participation of all people.\r\nMr. Kllid. (Finland): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\nfive Nordic countries: Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Finland.\r\nThe principles and targets of the United Nations International Plan ~f\r\nAction on Ageing, which was adopted ten years ago, are still valid. The World\r\nAssembly on Ageing held in 1982 had considerable influence on the discussion\r\nof old age in general and especially on people\u0027s attitudes. Today Ellderly\r\npeople are seen more and more clearly as a resource. Independence, personal\r\ninitiative and living in one\u0027s own home\u0027are aspects that are now emphasized\r\nmore than they were before in all Nordic countries. The emphasis in services\r\nfor the elderly has been shifted from institutional structures to open care.\r\nIn the Nordic countries, the social status of the elderly has ~isen as a\r\nresult of their increased lverage age and improved health and social\r\nconditions. Their needs, thus, have to be taken into account in all sectors\r\nof societal life: in working life, family policy, education and community\r\nplanning. This has resulted in improvements in the conditions necessary for\r\nindependent living, which has in turn led to greater understanding and\r\ncooperation between 9~nerations.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI\r\nAl471PV.. tO\r\n19-20\r\n(Mr. Kiirii, Finland)\r\nIn the Nordic countries the bulk of expenditures related to old age goes\r\nfor pensions. Even though the structures and compensation levels of Nordi~\r\npension schemes vary considerably from country to country, the income security\r\nof elderly people is, by international comparison~ good in all Nordic\r\ncountries.\r\nIn the Nordic countries pensions have relieved the younger generations of\r\neveryday personal responsibility for securing the living conditions of the\r\nolder generations. The foreseeable growth of the overall e:penditures for\r\npensions\", however\" worries us.. It is obvious that we have t.o reform our\r\npension schemes in order tu hold down expenditures.\r\nAt present, a particular problem is retirement prior to the actual\r\npensionable age. It is paradozical that at the s8Jlle time as the health of the\r\nageing popUlation is improving, people\u0027s desire to retire beiore the actual\r\npensionable age is increasing.\r\nOne major objective of Nordic social security policies is to provide all\r\nresidents with comprehensive social and health services. We have succeede~\r\nrelatively well in this regard. However, it is justifiable to ask if we have\r\npaid enough attention to the everyday life of elderly people. Do we take\r\nsufficient account of their own wishes? Has their participation in society\r\nbeen adequately safeguarded? Do we genuinely listen to the voice and wisdom\r\nof old age or do we plan their lives from above, so to speak, according to our\r\nown values?\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n21\r\n(Mt.IOOriD, Fipland)\r\nThe level of knowledge about ageing, about the preventinn of problems\r\nrelated to old age, and about opportunities offered by the community is of\r\nparticular importance. During the last few years, the elderly themselves,\r\nthrough pensioners\u0027 organizations, have become increasingly involved in the\r\nimprovement of the velfar~ and vell-being of their own group. Participation\r\nand equality remain major goals and imply that pensioners must be given the\r\nsame npportunities as others with regard to financial prosperity, education,\r\nwork, housing, traveling 6Dd cultural and leisure pursuits.\r\nAccording to a new law in Norway, Norwegian municipalities and counties\r\nwill be required to appoint councils for the elderly. The council is an\r\nindependent advisory body of five to nine old-age pensioners nominated by the\r\npensioners\u0027 union and appointed by the municipality or county. Its tasks are\r\nto make recommendations on all matters of policy concerning the elderly,\r\nwhether put forward by the municipality or county or on their own initiative.\r\nThe rising average age also means a growing number of people in need of\r\nspecial care and welfare services. Especially those elderly people who suffer\r\nfrom dementia need support and various types of services. In Sweden a\r\ncomprehensive administrative refo~ is being implementad, bringing about a\r\nmajor expansion of group dwellings for elderly people with dementia and those\r\nwith equivalent needs.\r\nOne of the most important reassessmants in welfare services for elderly\r\npeople in the Nordic countries has been the gradual shift of emphasis from\r\ninstitutional to community services. This has been made possible through the\r\nimproved health and financial situation of elderly people as well as improved\r\nhousing conditions. Denmar~ al~eady has an advanced and innovative system of\r\nhousing services, providing the elderly with a wide and flexible range of\r\nchoices and combinations.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nIi Al41/PV.40\r\n22\r\n(Mr.xairia, Finland)\r\nThe number and proportion of elderly people living in their private homes\r\nis increasing. This indicates that an increase in the number of elderly\r\npeople dQes not necessarily increase the need for social services. We can\r\nexert an influence in this respect by our own action and choices, as the\r\nDanish examples show.\r\nOld-age welfare policies are closely tied to the economy and to available\r\nfinancial resources. In tag years to come, the implementation of the\r\nobjectives of such policies will be influenced by the slower growth in our\r\nnational economies, compared with what we were accustomed to i~ the 19805.\r\nThe needs of the elderly will have to compete for resources with Dther\r\nsectors. This underlies the need for defining priorities based on common\r\nvalues and effectively using available resources.\r\nGiven the demographic and economic changes, the development of our\r\nnational policies for the elderly should be based on the followinq\r\nprinciples. The boundaries between institutional and open care must be\r\nbroken, and elderly people in need of care should be able to choose between\r\nthe two. Alternative ways of providing the necessary services must be\r\ndiscussed openly. Cooperation between social welfare and health care has to\r\nbe intensified. The strict division of labor between different categories of\r\nprofessionals within the service network must be reduced and informal care and\r\nvoluntary activities encouraged. Moreover, elderly persons\u0027 own\r\nresponsibility for carrying the costs of services will be more important in\r\nthe future.\r\nIn order to be able t,) pursue a policy of humane and econo~ically sound\r\nwelfare for the aged, it is important to encourage the contributions of\r\nfamilies, the local communtty and elderly people themselves, in addition to\r\nthe appropriate financial support from society. For instance, pensioners in\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA147/PV.40\r\n23\r\n(MlJliirii, Finland)\r\nbetter health may wish to help their frai1er fellow citizens, if suitable\r\nchannels are found.\r\nIn Finland social legi31ation is being amended to improve the legal\r\nstatus of informal caretakers, mostly family members. The aim is to make it\r\npossible for frail elderly people to continue living within their familiar\r\nsettings and to make informal caretaking a real alternative to employment\r\noutside the home.\r\nIn the foregoing, I have sketched the outlines of welfare policies for\r\nthe elderly in Nordic countries and the future prospects of such policies,\r\nwhich have many points in common with the Secretary-General\u0027s present proposal\r\nof eight global targets on ageing for the year 2001 (A147/339). Especially\r\nimportant in our view is target No, 3, regarding support for local communities\r\nin their endeavours to create better services and programmes for the elderly.\r\nThis target corresponds to the Nordic approach, which aims to shift\r\ndecision-making and responsibility to a greater extent to the local level,\r\ncloser to the citizens\u0027 real needs.\r\nIn developing welfare policies for the elderly, it is of primary\r\nimportance to intensify cooperation at both national aad in~ernational levels,\r\ninclUding Governments, non-governmental organizations, voluntary organizations\r\nand researchers - without forgetting the elderly people ·themselves. Such\r\ncooperation requires an improved exchange of information between the United\r\nNations, its Member States and other bodies. In the future, regional\r\nconferences could also be envisaged, as the problems vary consid~rab1y from\r\nregion to region. Since the resources available in the near future may not be\r\ngrowing, existing contacts such as the network of non-governmental\r\norganizations should be used more effectively.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV. (0\r\n24\r\n(Mr.Xaaria, Finland)\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General quite rightly draws special attention\r\nto the situation of the developing countries and the need to improve the\r\ncircumstances of the elderly in those countries. The United Nations has a\r\nsignificant role to play, especially in supporting projects related to the\r\nageing of the population in the developing countries. Despite urbanization\r\nand other structural changes in society, the developing countries should be\r\ngiven encouragement and support in their own efforts to maintain family\r\nstructures in which elderly people are respected and cared for at home.\r\nAs stated in the repo:t of the Secretary-·General, the broad goals of the\r\nPlan of Action on Ageing, which was adopted 10 years ago, have not been\r\nreached. Therefore, it would have been desirable for the General Assembly to\r\nbe presented at this special series of meetings with an evaluation of the\r\nimpact of the past decade on the living conditions of the elderly and the\r\ndevelopment of welfare policies for them.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General communicates the negative notion of\r\nan uncontrollable demographic problem. While this concern can be shared by us\r\nI\r\nall, a positive and realistic approach backed up by adequate information would\r\nbe an important starting point for national and regional programmes of\r\naction. The preparation of national targets and programmes is most important,\r\nbut setting goals and adopting national programmes is not enough. Active\r\nimplementation and evaluation of the measures taken is also needed.\r\nAll nations need old-dge welfare policies that are open to reform and\r\ninnovations and based on the needs of the elderly. Through international\r\ncooperation we can learn from each other, applying the models of action that\r\nsuit cur own countries and cultures. I am convincad that the dedication of\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n(Mr,Eaaria, Finland)\r\nthese four special meetings of the General Assembly to issues of ageing give\r\nus th~ r~quired new impetus for rethinking and reformulating our old-age\r\npolicies at both the national and tha international levels.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.40\r\n26\r\nMr. HOMO (Zimbabwe): The Zimbabwe delegation expresses its sincere\r\ncondolences and deepest sympathy to the delegation of Egypt, and through it to\r\nthe families of the victims of the recent earthquake which claimed many lives\r\nand has caused so much SUffering to the people and Government of Egypt.\r\nThis tenth anniversary provides us with an occasion to evaluate the\r\nimplementation of the 1982 Vienna Plan of Action and to adopt the United\r\nNations Principles for Older Persons, a practical step indeed.\r\nThe issue of ageing is of vital importance to the developing countries\r\ncontrary to the myth that it is a concern of developed countries only. It is\r\nsaid that the world population is expected to reach 6.3 billion by the year\r\n2007, and two thirds of. that number will be in developing countries.\r\nAccording to United Nations projections for the years 1980 to 2025, the\r\nAfrican region will experience one of the largest increases in numbers of\r\npersons aged 60 and over among all the world\u0027s regions. Thus it is estimated\r\nthat its older population will rise from 22.9 million in 1980 to 101.9 million\r\nby the year 2025.\r\nIt is also important to point out that in the coming decades, the African\r\nelderly population is going to remain largely rural. Recent projections\r\nindicate that in the year 2000 approximately 60 per cent will live in areas\r\ndefined as rural.\r\nBecause of the cost of support structu~es for the elderly, developing\r\ncountries will probably take a path different from the welfare approach widely\r\nadopted in developed countries. The policy implications of the rapid numerical\r\ngrowth in Africa\u0027s elderly population during the period from 1980 to 2025\r\nbecome even more pronounced if one considers that this group-will grow faster\r\nthan the population as a whole. Therefore the fact that in the year 2000 a\r\nlarger proportion of Africa\u0027s elderly will live in areas defined as rural is\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n27\r\n(Mr. ,tomo, Zimbabwe)\r\ncause for concern. The large increases in the number of older per~ons ~ust\r\ninfluence planners in providing health care, social welfare, income security\r\nI\r\nand rehabilitation facilities appropriate for this rapidly growing segment of\r\nthe population. Though the service infrastructure will have to be\r\nstrengthened in both the rural and the urban context to meet the needs of the\r\ngrowing numbe~s of the ageing, policy makers should focus particular att~ntion\r\non the historically weaker rural areas.\r\nState-based social security systems are not well established in most\r\ndeveloping countries. According to available evidence, the extended family\r\nand the community still constitute the primary sources of care for the\r\nelderly, maintaining traditional responsibilities for providing them with\r\nnecessary shelter, clothing, food and health care. However, it has become\r\nclear that with urbanization, industrialization and modernization, this\r\nsupport system is constantly weakening. Specific impacts include physical\r\nseparation of family members when young persons take up employment in distant\r\nplantations, mines or factories, or migrate to cities in senrch of jobs or\r\neducation.\r\nThe growing size of the vulnerable section of the population is itself a\r\nmatter of great concern. So far, because of an abnormally high young\r\ndependency ratio, the social-service delivery system has been geared mainly to\r\nthe needs of the young population. With the growth in the dependency ratio of\r\nthe elderly at the expense of the young, it will ba necessary in the future to\r\npay greater attention to the development of delivery systems aimed at serving\r\nthe elderly.\r\nHealth care for the elde~ly is yet another problem. People are\r\nespecially susceptible to health problems when they are very young or when\r\nthey are very old. Various studies dealing with the status of the health of\r\ni\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/E\u003eV.40\r\n28\r\n(Mr. Nkomo, Zimbabwe~\r\nthe elderly in Zimbabwe have indicated that substantial numbers of the\r\nelderly, in both rural and u~ban areas, suffer from various kinds of ailments\r\nat one time or another, and in some cases the diseases are chronic. Yet the\r\nhealth-care delivery systems qeared specifically to the :needa of the elderly\r\nare less than comprehensive. ~Ae elderly have to make do with an existing\r\ngeneral hoalth-care system which not only is inadequate for their specific\r\nneefIs but also is not eQsily accessible. There is thus a growing need for\r\nsupplementing the resources of the family with external services for taking\r\ncar0 of the elderly. Such supplementary care is especially needed by the\r\nelderly who live alone, either by choice or by force of circumstances.\r\nElderly women are much rr~re vulnerable than men. Culturally, women are\r\nmostly dependent on men. In terms of education also, they lag far behind\r\nmen. They are rendered even more vulnerable by the fact that most of them\r\nbecome widows when the~ a~e old, mainly because women generally live longer.\r\nIn Zimbabwe, among the elderly persons living alone, the percentage of elderly\r\nwomen is much higher.\r\nAIDS has now added e new dimension to the problem - a reversal of the\r\ntraditional system of roles in which the children and grandchildren looked\r\nafter and cared for their elderly. It is now the elderly who are increasingly\r\nfaced with the enormous task of caring for orphans. This task falls almost\r\nexclusively on elderly women. In Zimbabwe the population of perso~s aged 60\r\nand above is currently estimated at 500,000, roughly 5 per cent of the total\r\npopuh,tion.\r\nDespite this large number, there is inadequate awareness of the needs of\r\nthe elderly, and a consequent neglect of the development of the necessary\r\nsupport systems. Such a state of affairs is very unfortunate, especially\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n29-30\r\n(Hl:.... Domo« gimba.mm)\r\nwhen one considers that the problem of the elderly is tuing on a lSerious\r\ndimension. The present complacent attitude towards the problem has, however,\r\nb~en supported by two major coneiderations of the past, ~~ly, a relatively\r\nlow proportion of the elderly in the population and an effective /Support\r\nsystem traditionally provided to the elderly by their families. but both of\r\nth~se coneitions are now rapidly changing, to the detriment of the elderly.\r\nHaving eXl!IJDinad the global and local situation, we now turn to the\r\nmeasures that Zimbabwe has dev~loped to improve ~e life and care of the\r\nelderly during the last d6cade~\r\nShortly after achieving independence in 1980, the country announced a\r\nhealth policy that promoted primal~y health care. This primary-health-care\r\nstrategy is designed to enable the greatest number of our people, particularly\r\nthe poor and those in inaccess~ble parts of the country, to benefit from\r\nhealth services. Although these health-care services were not specifically\r\nfocused on the elderly, they nevertheless did not exclude them.\r\nA vigorous nutrition programme has also been launched since\r\nindependence. This measure, which has been integrated into prtmary health\r\ncare, benefits mostly those under five, but it is also accessible to the\r\nelderly.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.40\r\n31\r\n(Mr. Nkgmo, Zimbabwe)\r\nIn 1986 an international workshop was held to develop the Zimbabwe Plan\r\nof Action for the Elderly. One of the most useful recommendaCions to come\r\nfrom this vorksho~ related to the need to create an intersectoral committee to\r\nwork out strategiee and coordinate programmes geared to the well-being of the\r\nelderly. This Committee, which involves representatives from government and\r\nnon-governmental organizations, churches and our educational institutions, has\r\nmads remarkable progress in motivating our Government to address the needs of\r\nthe elderly in a much more meaningful way.\r\nI~ 1988 a Social Welfare Assistance Act was promulgate~. Its purpose\r\nwas to render public assistance to the disadvantaged groups, which includo the\r\nelderly.\r\nFurther, a national social security act was passed to guarantee income\r\nsecurity in old age to workers in both the formal and the non-formal sectors.\r\nThese two pieces of legislation offer concrete evidence of the action~ taken\r\nby my GoverJUllent, in compliance with the Vienna Plan of Actit.,;1, to provide\r\nincome security to the needy elderly.\r\nGenerally, governmental and non-governmental policies are focused on\r\npromot.ing the independent living of the elderly in their normal home\r\nenvironment. Programmes such as public assistance, drought relief, h~me help,\r\nmeals on wheels, community-based rehabilitation and primary ~ealth care are\r\nall aimed at strengthening the family support and the well-being of the\r\nelderly.\r\nWhile our policies and programmes emphasize community-based assistance,\r\nthere are exceptional instances where the elderly have to be cared for in\r\ninstitutions. Zimbabwe has more than 35 homes for the aged run by\r\nnon-governmental organizatious and churches. Our Government contributes to\r\nJ\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n-------~-----~---------_.-\r\nAl47/PV~40\r\n32\r\n(Mr. NJcomo, Zimbabwe)\r\nthe care of the elderly in such institutions through offering per capita,\r\nbuildinq and administrat.ive grants.\r\nIn 19~1 a workshop was held to review the 1986 Zimbabwe Plan of Action\r\nfor the Elderly. The workshop noted some progress in some areas; but it\r\nobserved that in the absence of comprehensive legislation to promote the\r\nindependent li\u0027vinq of the elderly, accessibility to housing, rehabilitation\r\nand changing community attitudes in favour of reqarding the elderly as\r\ncontributing members and guaranteeing them income security and accessibility\r\nto health services, there would be serious limitations to the Plan of Action.\r\nAccordingly, the Zimbabwe Government has now resolved to create a\r\ncomprehensive piece of legislation that embraces both the 1982 Vienna Plan of\r\nAction and the 1986 Zimbabwe Plan of Action to address the needs of our\r\nelderly in a much more practical and useful manner.\r\nWhile Zimbabwe may have done well up to now, I wish to point out that\r\nthe uneven implementation of the Vienna Plan of Action may be attributed to\r\nmany reasons, among which is the inadequacy of resour~es in developing\r\ncountries. Thus, with respect to the future, we believe that community care,\r\nfounded upon and sustained by political will and supported by appropriate\r\nlegal instruments on the part of governments, will offer the best means of\r\nmeeting the needs of the elderly much more effectively, more systematically\r\nand more efficiently.\r\nAs demographic ageing is predictable, we are concerned that our social\r\nand economic infrastructures will 1ag behind. Thus, national governments and\r\nthe international community have to revise their strategies.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nM471PV.40\r\n33\r\n(Mr. Nkomo. Zimbabwe)\r\nIn our view, the strategies must aim at: ~nabling people to live as\r\nnormal a life as possible in their own homes, in a family environment and in\r\nthe local conununity; providing the right level of care and support to help\r\npeople achieve the greatest possible degree of independence; and giving people\r\na greater say in how they live their lives and the services they need.\r\nIndeed, the first decade of the Plan of Action achieved some degree of\r\nawareness of the challenges of ageing and the potentialities of older persons,\r\nbut our vision for the future cannot be fully realized without substantial\r\nresources being channelled into the developing countries.\r\nZimbabwe is in agreement with the global targets contained in the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report (A/47/339), which are a practical strategy for\r\nchannelling the interest, enthusiasm, expertise and experience of many elderly\r\npeople and defining the priorities to the year 2000, as stated in that\r\ndocument. We are satisfied that the document provides the framework for\r\nactivities to be undertaken at the national and the international level.\r\nIn this regard, we call for the strengthening of the regional\r\ninstitutions, particularly the nascent African Gerontological Society, which\r\nis lagging behind in the fulfilment of its mandate, and the Panos Institute,\r\nas well as the appropriate United Nations institutions.\r\nWe hope very much that when the Conunittee on Social Development meets\r\nnext year in Vienna, as it begins preparing for the 1995 world summit for\r\nsocial development, the agenda will include a special section on the elderly.\r\nMrs. TAVARES de ALVAREZ (Dominican Republic) (interpretation from\r\nSpanish): The delegation of the Dominican Republic wishes, first of all, to\r\njoin in the expression of condolences by the delegation of Zimbabwe to the\r\nEgyptian nation with regard to the disaster that occurred there.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.40\r\n34-35\r\n(Mrs. Tavares de Alyarez,\r\nDominican Republic)\r\nOrdinarily, the ~elebration of an anniversary i~ a time for looking\r\nback, but the 1982 World Assembly on Ageing held at Vienna and the\r\nInternational Plan of Action on Ageing, which was its immediate result,\r\nengendered a creative change. The Plan was forward-looking. The measure of\r\nits success is that today we are not just praising it, we are building upon\r\nit, and reshaping it to fit changing circumstances and our perception of what\r\nthe ageing of populations means to our societies. The Plan of Action on\r\nAgeing relates less to what has happened Ulan to what is happening and what is\r\nto come.\r\nOne can see this in the report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nImplementation of the Inte~national Plan of Action on Ageing; celebration,\r\nassessment, planning ahead. This document honours the Plan of Action on\r\nAg~ing by showing just how live and adaptable it is. As the report states:\r\nu ••• it has been a year of arrival, but more importantly, it is one of\r\ndeparture.\" (A/47/369, para.47)\r\nAttitudes are beginning to change. The world is finally beginning to\r\nsee that population ageing involves much more than humanitarian assistance.\r\nThe very words we use express this transformation. We hear less and less\r\nabout the problems of ageing and more about productive ageing. We are\r\nconcerned not only with helping but also with empowering the elderly.\r\nEmbedded in this practical, developmental approach to ageing that has come to\r\nthe fore, is the notion that dependence between the generations does not just\r\n90 one way. At long last we are recognizing the full human potential of the\r\nelderly.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n36\r\n(Mrs. Tayares de Alyarez,\r\nDomipican RQPUblic)\r\nWe are learning to adapt our approach to the resources and technology\r\navailable. We have finally realized the value of reaching out to\r\nnon-governmental organizations and the private sector in cooperative efforts,\r\nin order to be able to do what Governments alone cannot do well or cannot do\r\ni\r\nat all. We are also becoming more aware of how much we underestimated the\r\nabilities of a fundamental human resource - the elderly themselves. The\r\nobstacle has often been not the creative and produ~tive potential of the\r\nelderly but the boundaries of our own imagination.\r\nOne crucial area in which this new kind of partnership has begun to bear\r\nfruit is that of productive ageing. In the past decade we have seen that\r\nolder people, besides having needs that must be met, have much to offer\r\nsociety. In our developing nations it is fortunate that we have r~coqnized at\r\nlast that with a little assistance many of the elderly are capable of helping\r\nsociety as they help themselves.\r\nSince zero growth is so often the economic context today, this is one\r\nkind of solution that is cost-effective. World population ageing is a\r\nconsequence of developme~t. But, as the World Council of Churches put it, the\r\nelderly have also become \"casualties of development\". Why not close the\r\ncircle and let those elders who can do so - mostly those from 60 to 75 years\r\nof age - become involved in the process of development and, in doing so,\r\npromote that process and help themselves?\r\nIn many of our countries senior enterprises are an increasingly important\r\nchannel through which productive ageing becomes a reality. With modest\r\ncapital investment, developing nations have already launched elders in such\r\nvaried businesses as child ~are, bakeries, automobile repair shops and\r\nword-processing.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n37\r\n(Mrs. Tayares de Alyarez,\r\nDominican Republic)\r\nNon-governmental organizations often sponsor such projects. Private\r\nenterprise too has bequn ~o play an important role; after all, social\r\nstability and keeping a lid on the tax burden are very much in its interest.\r\nThe Secretary-Generales report cites the recently created Banyan Fund,\r\npart of the new partnership to provide a little assistance for\r\nproductive-ageing initiatives. Based in Paris, the Fund is a private,\r\nindependent organization sponsored by the United Nations. Among other\r\nactivities, it raises capital from the private sector and from other\r\nnon-governmental organizations to finance projects in which older people\r\nbecome masters of their oWh economic fate - even agents of economic\r\ndevelopment - rather than merely passivf recipients of assistance.\r\nThe report also mentions the International Institute on Ageing,\r\nestablished in Malta under United Nations auspices. That Institute has\r\nfostered vitally needed research, disseminated information and provided\r\ntraining in the field of ageing.\r\nSimilarly encouraging is the recently formed African Gerontology Society,\r\nwhich has displayad a great spirit of initiative, even in the face of the many\r\nother pressing economic problems troubling that continent.\r\nWe should like especially to acknowledge Cbe United Nations Population\r\nFund\u0027s many contriuutions to the United Nations programme on ageing. The\r\nresearch project \"Developmental implications of demographic change: global\r\npopulation ageing\" ident.ifies the roles\" relationships and contributions of\r\nolder persons and of their families and communities in our developing\r\nI\r\ncountries. It should help us to formulate programmes and projects that are\r\nparticularly relevant to our experience with ageing, which is not always the\r\nsame as that of the develo,?ed countries.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n38-40\r\n(Mrs. Tayares de Alyare;,\r\n~mipicap Republic)\r\nThe project is financed by the United Nations Population Fund with\r\nco-funding from HelpAqe International, the American Association of Retired\r\nPersons (AARP) and the SSM Bridges International Center on Aging. The Swedish\r\nGovernment also made a major contribution.\r\nWe are especially proud to add to these successes the announcement that a\r\ncentre on ageing at Santiago, Dominican Republic will open officially in\r\nJanuary 1993. Under the sponsorship of the SSM Bridges International Center\r\non Aging, it will serve as a laboratory for testing and validating new\r\napproaches to empowering the elderly in a third world country. The main\r\ncharacteristic of those app~oaches is that they could be adaptable to other\r\ncountries.\r\nWe have learned from experience that a central task in improving the lot\r\nof the elderly, now and in the future, is to bring them back into the\r\nmainstream of society. Either they are citizens with rights and appropriate\r\nresponsibilities or they are not. If not, they can be no more than a burden\r\non society\u0027s limited resources at a time when other qroups are competing for\r\nthose resources. As citizens, they can make a contribution, enlarging the\r\npool of material resources with other, intangible resources - such as\r\nexperience, knowledge and wisdom - that will be sorely needed in the coming\r\ndecades.\r\nTo set this process in motion, we shall have to convince policy makers of\r\nthe strategic importance o£ this sector of the population, for it is\r\ninevitable that some scarc~ public resources will have to be allocated to\r\nageing-related programmes. This will become more feasible politically when it\r\nis seen as tapping the productive potential of older people, and thus as an\r\ninvestment, not just another social-welfare expense.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n41\r\neNta. Tayares de Alyarez,\r\nDominican Republic)\r\nWe believe that we are pointed in the right direction. The report of the\r\nSecretary-General entitled \"Global targets on ageing for thQ year 2001: a\r\npractical strategy\", constitutes the most recent undertaking of the United\r\nNations progranne on agein9. It outlines what is feasible at this time and\r\nseeks a more effective use of existing structures, procedures and resources.\r\nIt is encouraging not only for its specifics but also for its general tone.\r\nThe report states ater alia:\r\n\"The target strategies comprise core activities, permitting expansion and\r\nadjustment in the course of the decade as experience is gained.\"\r\n(A/47/339, para,12)\r\nThus we approach our tQ~ks ~ith an open mind, for we are trying to find out\r\nwhat works.\r\nThe global targets document also makes it clear that we are not dealing\r\nwith elderly people as merely subjects of our concern. The report sees the\r\nelderly as \"both agents and beneficiaries\" of development. The importance of\r\np~oductive ageing is implicit throughout the entire document.\r\nThe report is imbued with the idea that older people belong in the\r\nmainstream of social life. For example, target No. 2 sets as a task the\r\nidentification of those programmes which have a component on ageing and the\r\nintegration of the subject of ageing into relevant United Nations inter-agency\r\nI\r\nmeetings for such issues a3 population, womQn, disabled persons, youth and\r\nfamily and into strategies for the current and next United Nations Development\r\nDecade. The report further emphasizes that issues of ageing are inextricably\r\ntied to virtually every ot~9r issue with which we must contend.\r\nThe report also states that the Centre for Social Development and\r\nHumanitarian Affairs is the nucleus of multisectoral cooperation and the\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl41/PV.40\r\n42\r\n(Mrs. Tayares de AlyareA,\r\nDominican RQPubli~)\r\ncatalyst of cooperation between the formal and informal sectors, and that it\r\ncovers the five world reqionsc All of this it does with a very small staff,\r\ninsufficient for the demands of today and far from beinq able to meet the\r\nprojected demands of tomorrow.\r\nThe Centre is an important tool in our response to population aqeinq. It\r\nis one of the means by which It!e may take true aim at our qlobal targets. We\r\ncan no longer afford to bl\u0027mt its effectiveness. We must take its work\r\nseriously and staff it so chat it may do the serious work that lies ahead of\r\nit.\r\nThere is much to be done to raise world consciousness of aqeinq of\r\npopulations so that there is the political will to allocate the necessary\r\nresources to accomplish these tasks. Therefore, let us begin with those steps\r\ntlllat are now within our power to take •\r\n.\r\nIn the past we have served the world\u0027s aqeinq populations through a few\r\nI\r\nstrategic measures, such as the adoption of the International Plan of Action\r\nI\r\non Aqeinq in 1982 and the adoption of the United Nations Principles for Older\r\nPersons in 1991. What better way could there be to celebrate this tenth\r\nanniversary than by endorsinq the qlobal targets on ageing for the year 2001\r\nand adoptinq the proclamation on ageinq of 1992 expressinq hope in humanity\u0027s\r\ncoming of age?\r\nSuch steps will enable us to say in another 10 years that the Plan of\r\nActi~n on Aqeing3 too, has aged productively.\r\nMr. WANG Zhaonua (China) (interpretation from Chinese): The World\r\nAssembly on Ageing in 1982 and the International Plan of Acticn on Ageing have\r\nplayed a very important role in promoting the work on ageing in China and the\r\nworld as well as world pea~e, friendship, snlldarity and cooperation. In the\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAJ47/PV.40\r\n43-45\r\n(Mr. Wang Zhaobua, China)\r\npast decade, thanks to the efforts made by the related bodies and agencies of\r\nthe United Nations, the issue of the ageing of the population has been given\r\nincreasing importance and attention by countries of the world.\r\nThe special plenary meetings of the United Nations General Assembly on\r\nageing, which take stock of the work done in the past and look into the\r\nfuture, will be another important event on ageing with historic significance\r\nand another initiative of vision and wisdom marking a new historical stage in\r\nthe evolution of the work on the question of ageing in the world. We believe\r\nthat these special meetings will bring new vitality to, and produce a positive\r\nimpact on, the cause of ageing in all countries of the world, and especially\r\nin the developing countries.\r\nIt is a Chinese tradition to respect, love and support the elderly. The\r\nChinese Government has alw3ys attached great importance to the issue of\r\nageing. The relevan~ United Nation~ resolutions on ageing and the\r\nInternational Plan of Action on Agei~g have been implemented in China with\r\nremarkable achievements.\r\nThe China National Committee on Ageing was establiRhed in 1982 as a\r\nnational mechanism for the implementation of the Plan of Action on Ageing,\r\nfollowed by the establishment of local committees on ageing as well as related\r\norganizations, such as the Gerontological Society, the China Fund for the\r\nElderly, the Association of the Universities of the Third Age and the Elderly\r\nSports Association.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n46\r\n(Mr. Hang Zhaohua, China)\r\nIn rural areas, associations of the elderly have been set up in 50 per cent of\r\nthe villages. Thus, a nationwide network of organizations on ageing has been\r\nformed, with more than 10,000 full-time staff and more than 100,000 part-time\r\nworkers and volunteers providing services to senior citizens.\r\nIn accordance with China\u0027s actual conditions and its cultural and\r\nhistorical tradition, the following five goals have been set for addressing\r\nthe issue of ageing: the elderly should be supported, medically cared for,\r\ngiven the opportunity to contribute to society, engage in life-long learning\r\nand lead interesting and happy lives.\r\nWide publicity has been given to the issue of ageing throughout the\r\ncountry with such publications as newspapers, magazines and pictorials on\r\nageing; various activities have been carried out to celebrate the\r\nInternational Day for the Elderly and the Chinese Double Ninth Festival - a\r\nday to honour the elderly in China -, model senior citizens have been rewarded\r\nfor their contribution to society and exemplary young people have been\r\nhonoured for their respect for the elderly.\r\nAcademic institutes and associations in the field of ageing huve been set\r\nup to conduct systematic research and study on the ageing of the population.\r\nTwenty-eight provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have\r\npromulgated local Laws on the Elderly to protect the legal rights of the\r\nelderly, and the drafting of the National Regulations on Protecting the Rights\r\nof Old People has been completed.\r\nThe social security system has been improved with the guiding principles\r\nof the combination of support by and contribution to society, basing social\r\nsupport on the contribution of the elderly, and giving play to the role of the\r\nfamily and society in supporting the elderly. A family contract on supporting\r\nthe elderly has been widely introduced in rural areas.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.40\r\n47\r\n(Mr. Wang Zhaohua. China)\r\nThe Government actively encourages the elderly to participate in social\r\ndevelopment. Thirty-five per cent of the 100 million elderly in China are\r\nplaying a role in various sectors of society.\r\nA number of facilities for the elderly, such as activity centres, special\r\napartmants, geriatric hospitals and stores devoted to the needs of th6\r\nelderly, have been set up. Two thousand five hundred schools, more than 70\r\nnewspapers and 2,500 factories that manufacture products for the elderly are\r\ndedicated to the service of our senior citizens. More than 30 million elderly\r\npeople are participating in various kinds of sports activities.\r\nLinks have been established with orqanizations from more than 40\r\ncountries in the world.\r\nChina\u0027s work in the field of ageing in the past 10 years has received\r\nsupport and assistance from the United Nations, the United Nations Population\r\nFund, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and other\r\ninternational organizations, for which I would like to express, on behalf of\r\nthe 100 million elderly Chinese, our cordial thanks.\r\nAs a developing country with a rather weak foundation in the work on\r\nageing, China still faces numerous difficulties in this field. At present,\r\nthe elderly population of China has already exceeded 100 million and is\r\nincreasing at an annual rate of three per cent. According to projections, by\r\nthe year 2000, the elderly population in China will reach 130 million, or\r\nabout 10 per cent of our total population, making China an \"aged\" society. By\r\nthe 2040s, this number will have peaked to 380 million, accounting for about\r\n25 per cent of the total population. The rapid rate of ageing of the\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n48-50\r\n(Mr. Wang Zhaohua, China)\r\npopulation in China is uniCJUe in the world. With such a fast pace of ageing\r\nand the huge absolute number of elderly, who account for about a CJUarter of\r\nthe world\u0027s elderly population and about half of the elderly population of.\r\nAsia, we need to continue our efforts. We eagerly look forward to continued\r\nassistance and support from the United Nations and other international\r\norqanizations.\r\nIn order to realize the international tarqets on aqeing, we will try to\r\naccomplish the following tasks:\r\nto improve the social security system and find a Chinese way of\r\nsupporting the elderly that will strengthen the role of the family and of\r\nsociety in a partnership between the State, the collective, the community and\r\nthe family;\r\nto map out a strategy and plan for the work on ageing tba.t would be\r\nintegrated into the national economic and social development plan for\r\nimplementation;\r\nto enhance the work on national legislation for the elderly, and\r\nlaunch a national educational campaign to promote respect, love and support\r\nfor the elderly;\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n51\r\n(Mr. Hang ?baohua, Chipa)\r\n- to formulate policies aimed at mobilizing the wisdom and ezpertise of\r\nthe elderly, giving them an opportunity to participate more actively in social\r\ndevelopment;\r\n- to promote social welfare, education, health Gervices and cultural\r\nactivities in the service of the elderly;\r\n- to set up a ~ervice network based in the community;\r\n- to strengthen scientific research on population ageing with a view to\r\nproposing policy options;\r\n- to further promote international exchanges and co-operation in this\r\nfield.\r\nWith the joint efforts of the international community in the last 10\r\nyears.. work on ageing has broken D.ew ground, and it ~ill enter a new stage in\r\nthe coming decade. Various social problems, including the issue of ageing,\r\nface the whole world and the developing countries in particular. We believe\r\nthat the international community should pay more attention and give effective\r\nassistance in this regard. We are confident that the United Nations has an\r\nimportant role to play in promoting international co-operation and ezchanges\r\nin the field of ageing.\r\nWe sincerely hope that all the elderly people in the world will enjoy\r\nsocial security and a constantly improving quality of life, and a carefree\r\nezistence in peace and happiness in their later years.\r\nFinally, I wish the Assembly complete success at these meetings and all\r\nthe elderly people in the world happiness and longevity.\r\nMr. BQRCUOGLU (Turkey) (interpretation from French): My delegation\r\ntakes pleasure in speaking on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the\r\nWorld Assembly on Ageing and the adoption of the International Plan of Action.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n(Hr. Burcuoglu, Tnrker)\r\nToday ageing population is a phenomenon that is apparent in all\r\nsocieties. It is demographic, social, economic and cultural. It is more\r\nevident in the developed countries, but it is also growing in the developing\r\ncount~ies. According to projections, the total number of elderly people,\r\nthose over 60 yearn of 8ge\" viII be 600 million in the year 2001; it viII rise\r\nto 1.2 billion by 2025. This phenomenon has an impact upon the social and\r\neconomic structures of societies~ raising complex problems that require the\r\nadaptation of relevant programmes and policies.\r\nTurkey is no exception to this overall pictu~a. Awareness of the ageing\r\npopulation is becoming ever more clear, catching the attention of relevant\r\ninstitutions and the media. The latter are contributing to increased public\r\nawareness on the subiect, and health services and rehabilitation centres are\r\norganizing themselves. The elderly benefit from dis~~unts in various sectors,\r\nfrom transportation to cultural activities. Private-sector initiativ2S for\r\nthe provision of services to the elderly are encouraged.\r\nIn Turkish society, the elderly have traditionally been accorded the\r\nhighest respect. They have made a valuable contribution to Turkey. That,\r\ntogethar with the role played by the Turkish family as the driving force ~vr\r\nsocial solidarity, constitutes a very important asset for Turkey as it deals\r\nwith questions related to its ageing population.\r\nThe first International Day for the Elderly was celebrated on\r\n1 October 1991. It gave us the opportunity to declare our solidarity with the\r\nelderly, and it contributed considerably to increasing international public\r\nawareness in this connection.\r\nLast year vas also m3rkod by the adoption of the United Nations\r\nPrinciples for Older Persons. Those Principles are intended to permit them to\r\nlive better in the additional years they now enjoy.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n53\r\n(Mr, BurcuQglu, Turkey)\r\nThis time, we have two new impQrtant dQcuments on our agenda.

It was noted at the non-aligned summit\r\nthat the population question cannot be considered separately from that of\r\noverall development but, rather, should be treated as an integral part.\r\nHo~sing, health cara and nutrition, labour and employment, as well as social\r\nsecurity, are examples of areas that will need adjustment to demographic\r\nshifts, in the light of specific needs and constraints. This will entail the\r\nadoption of policies that are not designed to warehouse the elderly but seek\r\nto include them in the development process of their respective nations, thus\r\nemploying their knowledge and skills and allowing for continued self-worth and\r\ndignity.\r\nTen years ago, the World Assembly on Ageing solemnly recognized that the\r\nquality of life is no less important than longevity, and that the elderly\r\nshould\r\n\"be enabled to enjoy in their own families and communities a life of\r\nfulfilment, health, security and contentment, appreciated as an integral\r\npart of society\". (A/C0NF.113/31, chap. VI A, Preamble, para. 2)\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n57\r\n(Mr. Supeno. Indonesia)\r\nMy delegation would like to reaffirm that recoqnition and the importance of\r\nimplementing programmes that will facilitate the continuing participation of\r\nthe elderly in all aspects of society. I should like to note that a general\r\npolicy recommendation of the Vienna Plan of Action was that policies and\r\nactions should be inspired by a determination to give qualitative content and\r\nmeaning to the increased years in life expectancy. The members of our ageing\r\npopulations must be afforded a continued opportunity to contribute their\r\naccumulated knowledge and experience in order to maintain a sense of purpose\r\nand accomplishment. It is, moreover, of benefit to overall national\r\ndevelopment when all human resources can be productively utilized. In this\r\nregard, the \"Global targets on ageing \"for the year 2001: a practical\r\nstrategy\" offer a useful framework for integrating ageing into development:\r\nWe must therefore continue to work towards the objectives of the\r\nInternational Plan of Action on Ageing, which includes not only attaining\r\ngreater awareness of the ageing question, but also translating that awareness\r\ninto appropriate responses. I should like to stress that development\r\nprogrammes in any society should take into account demographic changes and\r\noffer appropriate responses. Within the developing countries as a whole, thus\r\nfar the institutional infrastructure has not been able adequately to meet the\r\nneeds of the increased ageing populations. Resources need to be found to\r\nenhance this capacity, anticipating that as more family members enter the work\r\nforce, it will become more difficult to provide traditional family care.\r\nWithin Indonesia, the demographic configuration of the nation will in the\r\nnot-too-distant future undergo a considerable transformation. Our total\r\npopulation is at present 180 million, and as of 1990 11 per cent were over the\r\nage of 50, and nearly 4 per cent over 65. As a result of our national\r\ndevelopment programmes, nutrition levels are improving, health care is\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.40\r\n58\r\n(Mr. Sypeno, Indonesia)\r\nbecoming more accessible, even in remote areas, and standards of living are\r\nlikewise increasing, along with the life expectancy rate, which now stands at\r\naround 60 years of age. The child mortality rate in 1971 was estimated at\r\n142 per 1,000, whereas in 1988 it was approximately 58 per 1,000, a decline of\r\nabout 59 per cent. At the same time, the national family p1auning programme\r\nhas been quite successful, with national population growth down to about\r\n2.1 per cent by the mid-1980s. What is particUlarly important for our\r\nnational po1icymakers to consider, however, is the fact that our 1980 census\r\nindicated that 42 per cent of the population was then under 15 years of age.\r\nThe members of this age group3 forming the largest percentage of the\r\npopulation, will reach their formative years toge.ther, and eventually we shall\r\nhave gone from a predominantly youthful society to an ageing one. It!~\r\ntherefore of considerable importance for us to address the question of ageing.\r\nIndonesia is of the view that matters concerning the improvement of the\r\nsocial welfare of the ageing should be dealt with by a national body, so as to\r\nensure a uniform course of action, integrated national programmes and\r\ncoordinated activities avoiding either an overlap or a gap. By virtue of a\r\ndecision taken by the Coordinating Minister for Social Welfare, a working\r\ngroup has been established sod given the mandate of assisting the Minister in\r\nformulating a comprehensive and integrated policy on ageing. It is our view\r\nthat, in principle, the Government and society share responsibility for\r\ndealing with matters relating to social welfare. For example, while the\r\nGovernment has taken steps ~o provide nursing homes for the aged who cannot be\r\ncared for at home, community-basea organizations have played a substantive\r\nrole in caring for them.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n59-60\r\n(Mr. Supeno, Indonesia)\r\nThe Indonesian delegation would suggest that, in promoting the social\r\nwelfare of the ageing, proper attention should be given to: first, creating\r\nemployment opportunities for those who still can and need to work, in\r\nconformity with existing regulations and standards of society; secondly,\r\nproviding education and training, both as an activity and as a means of\r\nretraining for different pr~fessions; thirdly, ensuring that social or income\r\nsecurity is available when help is needed, as well as nursing homes; fourthly,\r\ndealing with the decrease in earning power as a result of retirement from\r\nservice or living on a pension; and, fifthly, enacting laws and regulations\r\nthat support and improve the social welfare of the ageing.\r\nIn conclusion, let me say that the Indonesian society has a long and\r\nstrong tradition of care and respect for the older members of its society, and\r\nca~e for older family members has been primarily within the home. We consider\r\nit to be very important that whenever possible the ageing should ba cared for\r\nnot in an unfamiliar and institutional setting but within the community, and\r\nwithin the family whenever possible. However, we also realize that as more\r\nfamily members begin to enter the work force the role of care-giver, usually\r\nfilled by the women of the household, will become more difficult. It is at\r\nthis time that the local community needs to step in to support the family and\r\nto supplement the family\u0027s ability to continue care-giving in the traditional\r\nand more comforting fashion. And it is essential that we do not approach\r\nquestions of ageing solely on the basis of what care and support need to be\r\ngiven but, rather, as a source of knowledge, wisdom and experience from which\r\nwe can greatly benefit and by which we can be guided. My delegation\r\nanticipates the opportunity to discuss this issue again in greater detail at\r\nthe World Summit for Social Development and at the International Conference on\r\nPopulation and Development, which will be convened in Cairo in 1994.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n61\r\n#\r\nMs. FRECBE\u0027lTE (Canada) (interpretation from French): It is a great\r\nprivilege for me to be part of this plenary meeting marking the tenth\r\nanniversary of the International Plan of Action on Ageing. Every society and\r\nevery individual is confronted with the realities of an ageing population.\r\nThe average life expectancy worldwide has increased considerably in the last\r\nforty years, with the result that Governments and individuals are now being\r\ncalled upon to address new situations and needs.\r\nWe have read with interest the Secretary General\u0027s report on\r\n\"Implementation of the International Plan pf Action on Ageing\". The treatment\r\nof the question of ageing has now obviously evolved to a certain maturity. We\r\nwelcome the strategy that anticipates the coming decade and the clarity and\r\npracticality with whica the guide was prepared.\r\nIn the area of seniors\u0027 issues, the Canadian experience is built on\r\nactive partnership and social responsibility. Canada has since 1982 continued\r\nto endorse fully the principles of the United N~tions International Plan of\r\nAction on Ageing and to work towards its practical application in the\r\ncountry. As a society, we accord high priority to meeting the entire spectrum\r\nof seniors\u0027 needs, ospecially in the area of health and social services.\r\nIn the past several years, seniors and other interested individuals\r\nacross Canada have formed groups an.d organizations concerned with\r\nageing-related issues. The Government of Canada, like all Canadians, realizes\r\nthe importance this dynamic sector of the population has for the future of our\r\n~ociety. This is why 20 years ago the Canadian Government created New\r\nHorizons, a programme devoted to offering financial assistance to groups of\r\nolder Canadians who plan and manage their own projects.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n62\r\n{Ms. Frechette. Canada)\r\nThe appointment of the first Minister of State for Seniors in 1987 qave\r\nfurther recognition to the status of seniora in Canada. The Minister of\r\nState\u0027s mandate was to give voice, in Parliament, to the interests and\r\nconcerns of seniors. In the years following that appointment, productive\r\nconsultations with seniors and the representatives of their organizations,\r\nself-help groups ~d individuals who work with older Canadians have been\r\nstepped up.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nFaced with the important changes in the basic needs of our population, we\r\nhave set out to design programmes, modify laws and debunk some of the myths\r\nthat lead to prejudice and misunderstanding. As is sU9gested in the\r\nInte~uational Plan of Action, these programmes can have a dual purpose. On\r\nthe one hand, they can encourage research into how seniors live their lives;\r\nand, on the other, they can help set standards that promote an enhanced\r\nquality of life and greater autonomy for seniors.\r\nIn the fall of 1991, we conducted the first National Survey on Ageing and\r\nIndependence, involving 20,000 individuals representing both tomorrow\u0027s\r\nseniors - people between the ages of 45 and 64 - and today\u0027s seniors - aged\r\n65 and older. The survey examined a wide range of issues relating to the\r\nquality of life and independence of seniors. The results will assist\r\nGovernments, national and local organizations and individuals in developing\r\ninnovative programmes and services.\r\nCanadians are sensitive to the needs and concerns of seniors. We are\r\nproud of our social security system, which is our largest\r\nprogramme-expenditure area.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n63\r\n(MA. Frechette, Canada)\r\nFurthermore, since housing is another concern for older Canadians, we\r\nimplemented the Residential Rehabilitation ~ssistance Program to ensure that\r\nhealth and safety standards are met and homes made more accessible. This\r\nprogramme, among other things, helps seniors to stay in their homes as long as\r\npossible and responds to their need for independence by allowing them to\r\nremain in their communi.ties •\r\nOne cannot ignore the problems faced by older women in our society. In\r\n1988, the Minister of State for Seniors a~d her colleaque, the Minister\r\nResponsible for the Status of Women, hosted a workshop on health and\r\nsocial-security needs for senior women and supported a series of follow-u~\r\nworkshops and research projects addressing this important issue.\r\nThe ageing of the population, along with the policy issues it entails,\r\ncontinues to pose important challenges for Canada. Canadians are deeply\u0027\r\ncommitted to creating a society in which seniors can realize their potential\r\nto the fullest and lead productive and independent lives.\r\nMr. KORAN (Czechoslovakia): We constantly hear that youth is\r\nobliged to show consideration and respect for the elderly and to ensure that\r\nthey enjoy a dignified retirement. Though this is true, it is not the sole\r\nreason for the interest of those who are still active in those who are\r\nretired.\r\nSome people say that the elderly are in fact persons with disabilities\r\ncaused by their age. That is not the case, since on the one hand, handicap\r\ndoes not necessarily mean disability - quite the contrary - and on the other,\r\nthe very age of the elderly, achieved over a lifetime of work and experience,\r\nis an advantage when they are compared with the young. Therefore, the young\r\nmust take an interest in the world of the elderly not only out of respect for\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n64\r\n(Mr Kukan c Czechoslovakia)\r\ntheir grey heads but also out of respect for them as the source of knowledge\r\nand experience acquired at a very high price. Let us speak, as we have done\r\nwith regard to disabled persons, about the necessity of creating equal\r\nopportunities aimed at harnessing and utili~ing their potential for all of us\r\nand for the fut~re. Let us not retire the most precious values: knowledge,\r\nwisdom and experience.\r\nThe United Nations deserves our appreciation for its efforts in this\r\nfield. The world\u0027s more intensive endeavours during the decade that has\r\npassed since the 1982 World Assembly on Ageing are also deserving of\r\nappreciation. This decade has certainly brought much progress in the area of\r\ncare for the elderly, even though that progress might have been and in the\r\nfuture should be greater because, among other considerations, the world\u0027s\r\npopulation is getting older.\r\nDuring the lO-year period from 1983 to 1992, when the International Plan\r\nof Action on Ageing was implemented, it was in Europe that the elderly were\r\none of the fastest-growing social groups. A relative and an absolute increase\r\nin the numbers of old people and the ageing of the elderly population have\r\nbeen observed. For those in Northern and Western Europe, the demographic\r\npressures are already being felt, whereas in Southern and Eastern Europe they\r\nare only beginning to have a significant impact. We are dealing with\r\nincreasing proportions of elderly people and decreasing proportions of young\r\npeople, with generational change; and we must deal with these matters in order\r\nto forestall the serious problems that will arise in the future if we are not\r\nable to alter our youth-oriented culture and way of thinking and if we\r\ncontinue to push the elderly into retirement and dependence.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n(Hr ltulum, Czechoslovakia)\r\nThe Czech and Slovak Federal Republic welcomes the eight global targets\r\non ageing for the year 2001 as proposed in the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General\"s report A/47/339 and considers them a solid basis for\r\nsetting up the overall strategy of the United Nations in its approach to the\r\nelderly.\r\nDuring the decade of the International Plan of Action on Ageing a number\r\nof formal measures were adopted that presented Czechoslovakia as a country\r\nthat cared about the position of the elderly in society. In many respects it\r\nlived up to that image; for eX81liple, in the number of nursing homes for\r\npensioners, the then-socialist Czechoslovakia had ond of the best records in\r\nthe world. ne reality, however, was more complsx than the image being-\r\ncreated for the outside world.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.40\r\n66\r\n(Mr. Kukan. Czechoslovakia)\r\nAn essential part of the social policy of presen~-day Czechoslovakia is\r\nits concern with ensuring the dignity of life so well deserved by the older\r\ngenerations, bearing in mind that \u0027the elderly of today have lived most of\r\ntheir lives without any chance to build the financial security that would\r\nprevent their being displaced to the periphery of society, and would instead\r\nafford them a full life after retirement.\r\nImmediately after the major changes in Czechoslovakia\u0027s orientation, it\r\nbecame apparent that the ac~omodation of the economy to market conditions\r\nwould be demanding and would bring about a number of social problems that the\r\nold social system was not capable of solving. Therefore, alongside the\r\neconomic reform scenario, a social reform programme has been developed to\r\nclarify policy in this field, distinguishing it from State paternalism by\r\nrestoring citizens\u0027 responsibility for their own fate and that of their\r\nfamilies, implementing equal conditions for all and eliminating unnecessary\r\npreferences in the social c~re system. Our intention is to create a universal\r\nand unified system that, under the conditions of the labour market, will\r\nprovide citizens unable to ~ake care of themselves with a distinct level of\r\nsocial care. Instead of general protection, there will be a transformation to\r\ndifferentiated, individualized assistance, provided to those who really need\r\nit.\r\nTo attain these goals, both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic\r\nhave adopted a set of measures providing for increases and regular adjustments\r\nin the income of pensioners, so that their pensions will not fall behind the\r\nincome of the economically active part of the population and will reasonably\r\nfollow increases in the cost of living. To ensure care for older people, the\r\nCzech Government has adoptej a law providing allowances for persons taking\r\ncare of someone who is over 80 years old or who is disabled.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.46\r\n67\r\n(Mr. Kakan, Czechoslova~ia)\r\nAs far as the employment of the elderly is concerned, there is relatively\r\nhigh economic activity in the population over retirement age, representing\r\napproximately 10 per cent of the total working population. For those who lose\r\ntheir jobs, the 1991 employment law considers citizens over 50 years old as a\r\nspecial category when it comes to finding a new position; exceptionally, a\r\npension may be awarded in the event of failure to find new employment.\r\nThe changed political atmosphere of Europe at the beginning of the 1990s,\r\nwith hopes for a more integrated continent of nations sharing experiences and\r\ncommon ideals yet all dedicated to retaining their individual cultural\r\ninheritance, provides both 3 challenge and an opportunity for developing\r\ninnovative systems of health and social care, closer collaboration between\r\nprofessionals from many varied backgrounds and objective cross-national\r\nresearch in areas previously considered too politically sensitive.\r\nAttitudes towards caring for the old have long been determined by the\r\nhealth of the economy, the general standard of living and the overall state of\r\nmorale within. society. Neglect and maltreatment in previous years may be more\r\neasily understood within the context of past history. In the future there can\r\nbe less justification for i;noring the special needs of older peopla or\r\nfollowing a policy of banisning them to institutions when demands come to be\r\nseen as excessive. The growing affluence of many European countries, with\r\ngreater understanding of, and a more positive approach to, those members of\r\nsociety least able to help themselves, should encourage the development of\r\nreadily accessible and inte;rated systems of care and concern.\r\nThe elderly in particular have formed the segment of population with the\r\nleast ability to defend themselves. With thousands of refugees on the move in\r\nEurope, those with disabilities have been left with little or no help at all.\r\nFurther cat~strophes, such as natural disasters and famine, could cause\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n68\r\n(Mr. Kukan, Czechoslovakia)\r\ndevastation to living conditions and interpersonal ties. Again, those most\r\naffected will be the elderly.\r\nUnder these circumstances, special measures are needed to ensure that\r\nadequate help is provided to those most affected. As the elderly have\r\nspecific needs, specific approaches must be implemented.\r\nIn conformity with its humanitarian traditions, and with the\r\nInternational Plan of Action on Ageing in mind, the Czechoslovak delegation is\r\nof the opinion that the time has come for the international community to sta~t\r\nthinking about the elaboration of some kind of international emergency network\r\nfor the elderly. The purpose of such a network would be to assist those\r\npopulatians where the elderly are affected by an unexpected and acute change\r\nof their situation and where existing political and economic systems are\r\nfailing.\r\nThe participants in this natwork could be those Member States of the\r\nUnited Nations that are affected as well as other Member States, along with\r\ndiverse local, national, reqion~l \u0027. other international governmental and\r\nnon-governmental organizations, individuals or informal groups. An\r\ninternational emergency fund for the elderly could work within the network to\r\nhelp cover the expenses of such aid.\r\nThe international community is obliged to protect the lives of vulnerable\r\ngroups in society under specific conditions and to develop an effective\r\ninstrument for international cooperation in this field. The more vulnerable\r\nthe group, the higher shouli be the priority.\r\nMrs. GILES (Australia): It gives me great pleasure to represent\r\nAustralia at these United Nations General Assembly special meetings on ageing.\r\nIn the decade since the Organization\u0027s International Plan of Action on\r\nAgeing was adopted, there have been major developments in many aspects of\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n69-70\r\n(Mrs. Giles, Australia)\r\nsocial policy concerned with older people in Australia. All these initiatives\r\nhave been within the framework of the Federal Government\u0027s social justice\r\nstrategy, whic~ is based on four broad sets of principles: the equitable\r\ndistribution of economic resources; equality of civic, legal and industrial\r\nrights; fair and equal access to essential services such as housing, health\r\nand education; and opportunity fo~ personal development and participation in\r\ncommunity life and decision-making.\r\nThe social justice strategy has special relevance to older people.\r\nIndividually and as a group, older Australians are more likely to be\r\nvulnerable to threats to their independence and rights than are many other\r\nmembers of society. It is this vulnerability and the consequent needs of\r\nolder people, not their age alone, that is the basis of policy development in\r\nAustralia.\r\nThe social justice strstegy is in close accord with the principles of the\r\nInternational Plan of Action on Ageing: independence, participation, care,\r\nself-fulfilment and dignity. These provide a framework for reviewing the\r\npolicies and programmes developed for older people in Australia over the last\r\n10 years. They also provide a foundation for looking to the future.\r\nAs Australia is often seen as a young country, this world Assembly serves\r\nan especially useful function in directing attention to older Australians.\r\nOlder Australians are the fastest growing sector of the Australian population.\r\nSince the 1981 World Assembly on Ageing, the number of Australians aged 65\r\nyears and over has increased by more than half a million, an increase of\r\n35 pQr cent.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA147/PV.40\r\n71\r\n(Mrs. G11es, Australia)\r\nLooking ahead for th~ next decade, it is projected that the population aged 65\r\nand aver will grow b~ 22 per cent, to reach 2.4 million by the year 2001. The\r\naged will then account for 12 per cent of the total population of Australia.\r\nIn demographic terms, Austrblia thus ranks in the middle range of ageing\r\nnations.\r\nTwo features of Australia\u0027s aged population warrant particular note.\r\nFirst, large numbers of those who were born oversees in non-English-speaking\r\ncountries and who migrated to Australia in the post-war years are now reaching\r\nold age. They are adding very substantially to the cultural and social\r\ndiversi~y of ageing in Australia. Secondly, aboriginal and To~res Strait\r\nislander people are another distinct component of the aged population, whose\r\nsocieties have traditionally given high esteeern to the role of elders and are\r\nnow experiencing many pressures in a changing world.\r\nThe last 10 years in Australia have indeed been a decade of action. The\r\nreport attached to this statement gives a detailed account of many initiatives\r\ntaken by the Federal Government, by State and Territory Governments, by\r\nvoluntary organizations and by older people themselves.\r\nI am only able to select some of these many achievements that show how\r\nthe principles of the International Plan of Action are being applied,and\r\ndeveloped in Australia.\r\nIndependence, the subject of the first set of principles for older\r\npeople, rests on three main conditions: having adequate incomes, housing that\r\nprovides not only shelter but a secure and supportive environment for daily\r\nliving and access to the same range of activities as others in the community.\r\nThe age pension is the cornerstone of economic independence for older\r\nAustralians. The provision of adequate retirement income is a central\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl41/PV,,40\r\n12\r\n(Mrs. Giles, Australia)\r\nobjective of AUI,tralia\u0027s social security policy and there is a general\r\nexpectation i~ the community that the age pension is an entitlement that gives\r\nrecognition ~o the years that people have contributed to the development of\r\nthe nation and will continue to do so.\r\nTo ensure the future viability of retirement income arrangements and\r\nprovide for greater choices for older Australians, significant reforms have\r\nbeen made to several areas of social security provisions. In order to extend\r\noccupational pensions, the superannuation guarantee charge was introduced in\r\n1989 in conjunction with the wages accord and industrial relations agreements\r\nwith employers and unions.\r\nTogether, these measures will provide more adequate income replacement in\r\nretirement and enable greater choice in planning for retirement life-styles.\r\nIn particular, there have been significant increases in superannuation\r\ncoverage for women in recent yeats.\r\nThe second set of principles of the International Plan of Action focuses\r\non participation through involvement of older people in Government policy\r\nmaking and support for community organizations. The Commonwealth Office for\r\nthe Aged, located within the Commonwealth Department of Health, Housing and\r\nCommunity Services, was established in 1986 to coordinate consultations with\r\nkey cons~er organizations. The principal bodies for consultation are now the\r\nconsumer forums for the aged in each State and Territory. These consist of\r\nindividuals drawn from a wide range of older people\u0027s groups, including\r\npensioner and superannuation federations, councils on the ageing, ethnic\r\norganizations, returned services leagues, aboriginal and Torres Strait\r\nislander communities, carers\u0027 associations, the Alzheimer\u0027s Association, and\r\nthe Country Women\u0027s Association.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.40\r\n73\r\n(Mrs. Giles, Australia)\r\nOver the last decade, several State governments have est~Jlished special\r\nunits on ageing supported by a variety of consultative committees on which\r\nolder people are represented.*\r\nOlder people participate widely in voluntary organizations. The role of\r\nvoluntary organizations was recognized in the Australian delegation to the\r\n1981 World Assembly, which included representatives of the Australian Council\r\non the Ageing and the voluntary Association of Gerontology. The participation\r\nof voluntary organizations has made a significant contribution to achieving\r\nthe goals ~f the International Plan of Action on Ageing.\r\nMany of these or9ani~ations provide opportunities for sarvic5 totha\r\ncommunity as volunteers, and both Federal and State governments fund eligible\r\ncommunity organizations to support their volunteer activities. Among the\r\ngroups that receive support under the Federal Government\u0027s community\r\norganizations support programme are the Australian Council on the Ageing, the\r\nAustralian Pensioners\u0027 and Superannuants\u0027 Federation, the Alzheimer\u0027S\r\nAssociation, and the recently formed National Carers\u0027 Association.\r\nGovernments have been able to draw upon a vigorous and effective older women\u0027s\r\nnetwork and the older persons\u0027 action centre in community activities such as\r\nthe proper use of medication by older people.\r\nThe value of participation in organizations extending beyond Australia is\r\nrecognized, and several channels have developed for international exchanges\r\nwith, for example, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development\r\n* Mr. Mongbe (8enin), Vice President, took the Chair.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n74\r\n(Mrs. Giles, Australia)\r\n(OECD) and the Centre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs\r\n(CSDHA). Older Australians have also represented their organisations at\r\nnumerous overseas meetings. In 1992 these included the International\r\nFederation on Ageing Congress in India and the International Federation of\r\nAssociations of Older People, in Spain.\r\nThe principles of the International Plan of Action conc6rned with care of\r\nolder people are strongly oriented t~ the development of community care, an\r\norientation shared by Australian policy in this area.\r\nThe Federal Government initiated a lO-year care reform strategy in\r\n1984-1985. The reform st~ate9Y is focused on provision of services within the\r\nhome so that older people may remain as i~dependent for as long as possible.\r\nThis approach is consistent with the expressed needs and desires of older\r\npeople themselves and those who\u0027;ll~~ for them.\r\nThe goals of the reform s~~~~e~ are concerned with providing equitable\r\naccess to the most appropriate care to accord with individual assessed needs\r\nand the effective utilization of available resources. To achieve these goals,\r\npolicy objectives have been set to bring about changes in the balance of care\r\nbetween residential and community care and, within residential care, between\r\nnursing homes and hostels.\r\nA mid-term review of tJbe reform ~trategy was unde~taken in 1990-1991.\r\nThe review reported that significant progress had been made in transforming\r\nAustralia\u0027s aged-care system from one that was inequitable, inefficient and\r\nimbalanced to one that is more equitable and efficient and provides a more\r\nappropriate balance of care.\r\nOne of the key programme initiatives that have reshaped Australia\u0027s aged\r\ncare programmes is the establishment of multi-disciplinary aged care\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n75\r\n(Mrs. Giles. Australia)\r\nassessment teams. In the first five years of the reform strategy, funding of\r\nhome and community care services doubled in real terms.\r\nAll aged care programmes recognize the special needs of different groups\r\nin the aged population. These groups include older people from\r\nnon-English-speaking backgrounds, aboriginal and Torres Strait islanders,\r\nolder people in rural and remote areas and people with dementia. Strategies\r\nto promote access to mainstream services include provision of information in\r\ncommunity languages and training of staff to develop awareness of different\r\ncultural practices and values.\r\nThe Federal Government has initiated a five-year national action plan for\r\ndementia care to give special assistance to people with dementia and their\r\ncarers. The aim of the action plan is to enhance the capacity of all aged\r\ncare programmes to meet the needs of this client group. Additional\r\ndevelopments will be supported in assessment, service delivery, community\r\neducation, measures to ensure quality of care, research and evaluation and\r\npolicy and planning. Copies of this plan have been distributed to the\r\nAssembly.\r\nMy focus now shifts from the frail aged to the wider population of active\r\nolder people - and this, at age 70, is the vast majority of Australians - to\r\nconsidering the fourth set of principles of the International Plan of Action.\r\nSelf-fUlfilment for older people comes from much the same range of interests\r\nand activities as for the community as a whole - from educational, cultural,\r\nspiritual and recreational opportunities.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.40\r\n76\r\n(Mrs. Giles, Australia)\r\nThe level of concern about these opportunities in Australia is reflected\r\nby two recent parliamentary inquiries. The report of the first inquiry,\r\nentitled \"Is Retirement Working?\", focused on measures that assisted older\r\npeople to maintain an active role in community affairs, and it gave access to\r\nadvice and options that promoted an active and positive use of leisure time.\r\nOpportunities that provide for maximum participation in continuing voluntary\r\nand/or paid work were also canvassed.\r\nThe second report, entitled \"Expectations of Life: Increasing the\r\nOptions for the 21st Century\", affirmed that much has been achieved i.n\r\nfostering the independence and well-being of older Australians. It addressed\r\nmany of the contemporary structural and philosophic~l changes in life-style\r\nand patterns of time use that are confronting Australian society and are\r\ncontributing to the debate about the meaning of successful ageing in Australia.\r\nOne specific example of the ways in which older people are taking the\r\ninitiative themselves is the growth of the University for the Third Age -\r\nU3A - in Australia. Established in 1984 in Australia, U3A is entirely a\r\nself-help initiative. By mid-1992, U3A was operating through almost 100\r\nindependent campuses, with some 16,000 members.\r\nAnother example that I am very pleased to give at this world assembly\r\nis the successful celebration throughout Australia in 1991 and in 1992 of the\r\nUnited Nations International Day for the Elderly. This has provided a very\r\nspecial opportunity to demonstrate the contribution of older people to the\r\ncommunity. An International Day for the Elderly calendar has been issued;\r\nit gives det\u0026ils of activities of interest to older people throughout the\r\ncoming year and identifies opportunities for participation in a wide range of\r\nactivities, many of them with an intergenerational focus.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n77\r\n(Mrs. Gi1es, Australia)\r\nThe fifth and final set of principles of the International Plan of Action\r\nare perhaps the most fundamental and underpin all the actions that I have\r\nmentioned so far. These principles are concerned with the dignity of all\r\nolder persons, the protection of their rights and their entitlement to equal\r\nopportunities without discrimination on the grounds of age.\r\nThe Australian Government has taken a number of steps to uphold the\r\ndignity of older individuals. User-rights initiatives have ensured that older\r\npeople in residential care facilities and those receiving community services\r\nenjoy the same fundamental freedoms as others in the community, inclUding full\r\nrespect for their dignity, beliefs, needs and privacy, and the· right to make\r\ndecisions about their care and the quality of their lives. The user-rights\r\nstrategy in residential care has five components: a charter, an agreement\r\nbetween the operator and resident, complaints units, community visitor schemes\r\nand advocacy services •\r\n. I especially want to highlight the community visitors schemes. These\r\nhave been implemented to improve the quality of life for residents of nursing\r\nhomes and hostels who do not have regular contact with the community. The\r\nmajority of community visitors are older people, but a wide range of age\r\ngroups are involved. Community visitors act as volunteers and receive payment\r\nto cover their expenses. This scheme has won acclaim from residents, visitors\r\nand nursing home staff alike.\r\nFor older people living in the community, the main area in which they\r\nseek to address perceived infringements of their dignity is through combating\r\ndiscrimination on the basis of age. Age-discrimination legislation is\r\nproceeding at both State and Federal levels. An age-discrimination task force\r\nhas been established by the federal Attorney General with a view to developing\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n78\r\n(Mrs. Giles. Australia)\r\nanti-discrimination legislation in the areas of commonwealth responsibility.\r\nAn Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is also taking an\r\nactive part in promoting change in these areas, and to give expression to\r\nAustralia\u0027s commitments under International Labour Organisation (ILO)\r\nconventions and recommendations. Legislative change in this area will give\r\nformal recognition to changes in community attit~des towards retirement and\r\nother age-based social conventions, and open the way for further changes in\r\nattitudes and practices.\r\nThe International Plan of Action on Ageing calls upon the international\r\ncommunity to enhance the lives of older people $0 tnat they can enjoy their\r\nadvancing years in peace, health and security. The achievements in realizing\r\nthe goals of the Plan of Action in Australia over the past decade are a matter\r\nof some pride to me personally and to the Australian Government and all\r\nAustralians who have contributed to the outcome. The efforts of older people\r\nindividually and through their many and varied organizations are particularly\r\nrecognized.\r\nThe achievements of recent years give hope for further progress in the\r\nfuture. I am confident that reaffirming Australia\u0027s commitment to the\r\nprinciples of the International Plan of Action on Ageing will bring renewed\r\ninterest and energy to our thinking and activity and will achieve continuing\r\nimprovements in the well-being of older people.\r\nAs I declare here in New York Australia\u0027s commitment to the principles of\r\nthe Plan of Action, the same commitment is being made by the Minister for\r\nAged, Family and Health Seriices, Mr. Pete~ Staples, in Parliament House in\r\nCanberra, Australia\u0027s capital. Mr. Staples is today meeting with the national\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n79\r\n(Mrs. Gilesc Australia)\r\nconsumer forums for th9 aged and he will b£ asking them to undertak~ the task\r\nof developing new targets for the year 2001 in accord with the International\r\nPlan of Action on Ageing. Ho group could be better equipped to undertake this\r\ntask. The outcome of their deliberations will most certainly ensure the\r\ncontinuing realization of the principles of the International Plan of Action\r\non Ageing for the benefit of all.\r\nMs. BERRY (United States of America): I have the honour of speaking\r\nat this special ~eries of meetings of the General Assembly on ageing, marking\r\nthe tenth anniversary celebration of the World Assembly on Ageing.\r\nAs the United States Commissioner on Ageing, I am responsible for\r\npromoting the independence and dignity of all older persons in our country.\r\nIt is the obligation of our Government to assure the positive impact of our\r\nprogrammes on the lives of older persons, their families and neighbours, with\r\nthe intent of keeping older persons in their own homes and in the community\r\nfor as long as possible. It is my belief that Government and voluntary as\r\nwell as private sector organizations and individuals all have a responsibility\r\nand a role to play in ensuring that those older persons who need assistance\r\nreceive it.\r\nI want to talk very briefly about the Natio~al Eldercare Campaign, the\r\nmajor Ageing initiative that our Government began last year and about which\r\nSecretary Sullivan spoke earlier. The principles upon which the National\r\nEldercare Campaign have been built are relevant to all of us who are\r\nconfronting the impact of global ageing. The Campaign is a call to action to\r\nbroaden the base of societal involvement and commitment to assist today\u0027s\r\nvulnerable elderly.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n\"A/41IPV.40\r\n80\r\n(Ms. Berry, United States)\r\nOur particular focus is on the physically and mentally impaired, socially\r\nisolated, those living alone, the rural, and those of low-income and minority\r\nstatus. We are encouraging all organiaations and individuals, including those\r\nnot traditionally associated with ageing, to participate actively in\r\ndeveloping solutions to thE pressing needs of today\u0027s vulnerable elderly and\r\nto help prepare for the growing number of at-risk older persons in the years\r\nto come.\r\nWe have found that in many cases there are untapped resources within\r\ncommunities. From collective action, advocacy and coalition building, greater\r\nparticipation and support from the community at large will result.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.40\r\n81\r\n(Ms. SertY, United States)\r\nWe acknowledge that goverJUllent, at all levels, cannot eto it alone. The\r\nneed is too great, and ou~ public resources are finite and strained. As the\r\nfrail elderly population increases, public resources vill be insufficient to\r\nkeep pace vith the demand. That is why we have to attach priority to\r\nbroadening the base of support for and commitment to the vulnerable elderly\r\nand why we are encouraging collective societal action and advocacy on their\r\nbehalf.\r\nThe social movement to promote elder care builds upon our nation\u0027s\r\nheritage of care-giving, which is so characteristic of our American families,\r\nand offers hope to the millions of ~nericans who live alone and are without\r\nspouses or relatives. Community coalitions mnde up of private-sector and\r\nvoluntary organizations, volunteers, religious leaders, older persons\r\nthemselves and others are reaching out to assist seniors at risk throughout\r\nthe nation under the National Eldercare Campaign.\r\nThe provision of home- and community-based services will continue to\r\nchallenge our nation as our older popUlation grows. We believe that the\r\nsocial movement of elder care strengthens and supports our family care-givers\r\nand serves as a nucleus for the development of public and social policy to\r\nensure human dignity for all Americans as we age. Through the campaign, we\r\nare beginning a national social movement to build commitment to and support\r\nfor the nation\u0027s vulnerable elderly.\r\nThe National Eldercare Campaign has touched a responsive chord across our\r\nnation as more people become aware of the needs of today\u0027s vulnerable seniors,\r\nas well as the challenge that confronts us in the future. More people are\r\njoining the Campaign every day, and there is energy and enthusiasm reflecting\r\nnew commitment to and support for our vulnerable older persons.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n82\r\n(MS. \u0027firtY, United States)\r\nAs we bow, all older persons want to feel wanted, secure, loved and\r\nneeded, All older persons want to live with dignity. This is what the\r\nRational Bldercare Campaign is all about - to create the environment in which\r\nolder persons CaD receive the support they need to help them to maintain their\r\nindependence and dignity in old age.\r\nI mincerely appreciate this opportunity to share these thoughts. It has\r\nbeen a great honour to address the General Assembly today.\r\nMr. HIPSUD-BQNNICI (Malta): All of us are avare that one of the\r\nmost significant phenomena of the twentieth century has been the dramatic\r\nposes unique challenges to every society, as, unlike other population-grovth\r\nvariables, it is neither amenable to change nor easily modified. Consequently\r\nthe attention of every Government should focus ~ot on vhether it can change\r\nthe basic process of population aging but, rather, on the very issues that\r\narise from this process.\r\nThe process of demographic and social change in Malta has, over time,\r\nmanifested itself in an overall change in attitudes, not only of the\r\nindividual but also of society at large. The elderly population as an\r\never-increasing component of society has already been substantially affected\r\nby repercussions of its own success. As a result of the declining birth rate,\r\ncoupled with an increase in life expectancy, the registered proportion of the\r\nelderly in Malta - currently 14 per cent - is expected to continue to rise\r\nsteadily, so that by the first gl\\arter of the next century one person in four\r\nwill be over the age of 60.\r\nThis projected rise in the absolute numbers and proportion of the old and\r\nvery old in the population vill determine the demand on provisions designed to\r\nmeet the diverse needs and stages of needs of the elderly indivi~~al.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n----------~\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n83\r\n(Mr. Mifsud-Bonnici, Malta)\r\nThe issue becomes more complex when one takes into consideration the fact\r\nthat the traditional role of the family in the daily care of and support for\r\nits elderly members is seriously threatened as this basic social unit is\r\nsubjected to various economic, social and ~sychological strains.\r\nMOreover, given the concurrent phenomena of industrialization,\r\nurbanization and modernization, as well as otbr - demographic and\r\nsocio-economic factors that have a direct bearing on the family structure and\r\nits function, it becomes evident that the needs of the frail elderly can no\r\nlonger be effectively met by the family alone without the support of\r\nspecialized programmes and services of the public sector. It is important to\r\nnote that such services should complement, rather than substitute for or\r\nreplace, family care. Governments, while trying to support and strengthen the\r\nfamily\u0027s traditional role of provider of care for the elderly, must at the\r\nsame time provide public delivery systems for those elderly who cannot rely on\r\nthemselves or on their families.\r\nIf Governments were to look at the growing proportions of the elderly\r\nwithin their populations from the point of view of welfare-state ideology the\r\nsituation would become more complex for the State and unbearable for the\r\nelderly, who, in turn, would be looked upon only as a tolerated burden on\r\nsociety.\r\nAware, on one hand, of the structural and functional changes in the\r\nfamily and, on the other hand, of the challenges and issues generated by a\r\nrapidly growing elderly population, my Government strongly believes that a\r\nsolution can be found only if there is a radical transformation from the\r\nwelfare-state model of social policy to the welfare-society model or, rather,\r\nthe caring-society model, in which every social institution - be it the State,\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\npt\r\nA/47/PV.40\r\n84\r\n~ (Mr. Mifsud-Bonnici, Malta)\r\n:w, the Church, the voluntary organisations, the community, family members or,\r\n): last but not least, the elderly themselves - has an important role to play by\r\nshowing that it actually altruistically cares.\r\nThe welfare of our elderly depends heavily on the policy-makers\u0027\r\npotential to conceive effective strategies that may at times vary extensively\r\nfrom traditional policies, which are basically of a financial or institutional\r\nazt nature.\r\nc The issues related to ageing are multidisciplinary in nature - covering\r\nsuch sectors as income security, health care, housing and environment, social\r\n;l: assistance and family protection, educational and cultural activities,\r\nrecreation and rehabilitation. Care of the elderly is a complex matter, and\r\n:r. tli the elements of care are highly interdependent. The health and happiness of\r\n! the elderly is dependent upon social, emotional and psychological factors.\r\n11: Social policy in Malta has dramatically developed from the traditionally\r\nproblem-oriented, depersonalized approach to the present-day\r\nr community-oriented, personalized approach covering the totality of the\r\n\u0027w individual\u0027s well-being while reflecting the centrality of the human being and\r\nthe human family.\r\nCurrent strategies provide various schemes from which the elderly benefit\r\neither in cash or in services. Pension schemes, free medical care, community\r\nprogrammes, home-help services and residential care constitute the core of the\r\na strategy that safeguards the general well-being of our elderly.\r\na The concept of welfare and security is of a multidimensional nature.\r\nLongevity has to be complemented by quality of life. Universal pension\r\nthe:, entitlement does not in itself ensure that the elderly remain active or that\r\nthey preserve their relationships with family, friends and familiar\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n85\r\n(MJj,Mifsud-Bonnici, Malta)\r\nsurroundings. In this context, and in the light of the fact that the elderly\r\nare not a homogeneous group, there has been a total shift in the nature of\r\nservice provision in Malta in the past four years. Particular focus is now\r\nbeing given to colllftunit,,-based care utrategies that cater for the individual,\r\nthus providing for personal needs, as distinct from fo~er policies that\r\nmaintained age aa their criterion for entitlement even though age alone is not\r\na reliable indicator of needs.\r\nSuch services as the Home Care/Help Scheme, Telecare and Meals on Nbeels\r\nare all strategies that were conceived and implemented with the primary aim of\r\nproviding the necessary personal care and support to enable an elderly person\r\nto continue living a dignified life in the familiar surroundings and privacy\r\nof his or her own home.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n86\r\n(Mr. Mifsud-Bonnici. Malta)\r\nAs a complementary endeavour to prevent relocation trauma, the Government\r\nembarked on the costly projects oE building community homes within different\r\nlocalities so as to satisfy the needs and demands for residential care that\r\nare presented by applicants living in that region. Such a policy is being\r\nadhered to in the belief that by remaining in one\u0027s own social surroundings\r\nadjustment should be less disturbing.\r\nAn increase in the number of e1gerly is bound to reflect itself in an\r\nincrease in the demand for services. Equally true is the fact that\r\nspecialized services ask for personnel with correspondingly specialized\r\ntraining, who should therefore be better able to identify, assess and provide\r\nfor the needs of the elderly. The Government, in collaboration with the\r\nInstitute of Gerontology at the University of Malta, is implementing training\r\ncourses in gerontology and geriatrics that are designed to give a deeper\r\nunderstanding of the complexities of old age. Such education programmes are\r\nnot only an invaluable investment but an essential asset for the future\r\ndevelopment of the existing network of services.\r\nThe formulation and implementation of policies should not be an end in\r\nitself. These have to be reviewed so as to ensure that they are meeting the\r\nwidest possible range of needs. Where and when necessary, such strategies\r\nneed to be supplemented or complemented by other services. The newly set up\r\nNational Council for the Elderly should prove to be an important organ when it\r\ncomes to the identification of needs and specification of wants.\r\nWith the aim of further expanding community-based care services, serious\r\nconsideration is being given to the eventual intrOduction of a handyman\r\nservice to carry out minor repair works in the elderly person\u0027s own home.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.40\r\n87\r\n(Mr. Mifsud-Boppici, Malta)\r\nThis should fill yet another gap in a compendium of services designed to\r\nenhance the quality of life of the individual by attending to his specific\r\nneeds in his own home.\r\nIt is felt that Malt~\u0027s achievements in the field of ageing can be argued\r\nto be outstanding, from both a national and international perspective. The\r\nservice package offered to elderly citizens renders Malta uni~ue among\r\ndeveloping and developed countries, in that it nationally provides for: 100\r\nper cent age-pension entitlements, payment of allowances for rents; rebate\r\non water and electricity meter rent charges; a 100 per cent entitlement to\r\nbonus; totally free hospitalization, complete access to public-funded health\r\ncentres; free prescription of drugs; non-contributory financial benefits in\r\nthe case of chronically ill persons; non-contributory carers\u0027 pensions for\r\nthose looking after elderly relatives; heavily subsidized community-based\r\nservices such as the Home Help Scheme and the delivery of meals; the\r\nextensive allocation of technologically advanced apparatus such as the special\r\ntelephone service provided under the Telecare Scheme; free access to the\r\nspecialized geriatric and rehabilitative hospital; heavily subsidized\r\nresidence in community homes that have been recently built to modern\r\nstandards; extensive refurbishment of long-standi~g residential\r\ninstitutions; upgrading of service through retraini~g of staff, procurement\r\nof modern physical aIds and medical equipment; completely free-of-charge\r\nsupply of incontinence pads on the basis of need; and financial assistance to\r\ncarry out adaptations in the home so as to enable a person to cope in spite of\r\nhis physical disabilities.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl4.7/PV.4.0\r\n88\r\n(Mr. Mifsud-Bopnici, M81t~)\r\nAbove all, it is noteworthy that such entitlements are universal,\r\nirrespective of sex, so that Maltese women have a direct access to services in\r\ntheir own right.\r\nThe Government of Malta\u0027s constant efforts to improve where and when\r\npossible the care services that are designed to meet the needs of an\r\never-growing number of elderly persons within the community are being\r\nsignificantly complemented by the sterling services provided by a number of\r\nvoluntary organizations, notably the Roman Catholic Church. Religion is a\r\nmajor factor in the lives of the Maltese. The elderly in particular regard\r\nthe Catholic Church as a very important part of their lives and derive great\r\ncomfort from its spiritual and material support.\r\nMalta\u0027s commitment to issues relating to ageing is not merely a secular\r\nexer~ise restricted to our national conditions and requirements. Malta has\r\nalso extended its international concern for the consequences of the ageing of\r\npopulations, especially in developing countries, where over three quarters of\r\nthe world\u0027s elderly will reside in the next 35 years. Lack of planning and\r\nawareness within this heterogeneous region will ensure that the majority of\r\nthe world\u0027s elderly will become marginalized. Through the fo;esight of\r\nMalta\u0027s intervention, and with the backing and support of the United Nations,\r\nthe International Instit~te on Ageing (INIA), was established to provide\r\ntraining to key personnel within developing countries.\r\nBut the needs in developing countries were found to be much more\r\ndiverse. INIA, as it is more popularly known, therefore rose to the challenge\r\nby extending its activities to include the establismnent of a collaborating\r\nnetwork among specialized agencies in both developed and developing countries,\r\nthe effective and practical exchange of information through its now\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.40\r\nSS\r\n(Mr. Mifsud-Bonnici, Malta)\r\nwell-established qua~terly bulletin~ ~, and through its publication and\r\nfree distributio~ of international monograph~ on ageing. So far the Institute\r\nhas published monographs for Australia, C~ada, China, Finland, Guatemala,\r\nHungary, and Israel. Preparations are also in hand to publish monographs for\r\nother countries including, Belgium, Cuba, France, Italy, Mexico, Poland, the\r\nUnited Kingdom and the United States.\r\nAll of these activities are the concrete and practical results of the\r\nVienna Plan of Action, representing the major expression of the United Nations\r\nresolution to face the challenge of the ageing of populations through\r\nappropriate planning.\r\nThe increasing central role that INIA is taking within the international\r\ndebate, and the burgeoning of collaborative projects with national\r\ngovernments, has firmly established the need and utility of this centre of\r\nexcellence. The Maltese Government, in cooperation with the United Nations,\r\nhas laid the base for the benefit of future generations.\r\nAn increase in the proportion of the elderly within society constitutes a\r\nheavier financial burden on a correspondingly decreasing economically\r\nproductive sector. Such a challenge is not easy to overcome as it is arguable\r\nthat economic growth will prosper at the same rate as the increase in demand\r\nthat is anticipated for the ageing of the population. This is the reality\r\nthat should monitor future developments in the years to come. However, with\r\nthe right tuning, the expansion and effectiveness of services can be\r\nmaintained, developed and enriched•\r\n•\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n(Mt. Mlfsud-BoDDici, Malta)\r\nThe GoverDment of Malta had the foresight to realize the emergence of\r\nsuch issues more than 20 years ago and it is now approaching the same\r\neventuality of change with planning, discussion and openness. May our\r\ndetermination and genuine coX1l\u0027ftitment see us through the challenge that we\r\nshall have to face at the turn of the century, in the best interests of the\r\nelderly.\r\nMrs. GONDWE (Malawi): On behalf of my delegation may I say that it\r\nis an honour and privi1eqe to address this Assembly once more on an issue\r\nwhich is so dear to many of us. The Govermnent of Malawi views this occasion\r\nas very special and is therefore lending its support to efforts at the\r\ninternational level to understand and deal with the issues of population\r\nageing.\r\nMalawi values ageing mainly because of its positive aspects. In this\r\nrespect the elderly are revered and respected as symbols of our nation\u0027s past\r\nand its link with the present and the future. My Life President, His\r\nbcu11ency Nqvazi Dr. H. lCamuzu Banda, has 1ed\r\no\r\nthe way 011 this front in Malawi\r\nthrough his speeches and by designating Youth Week, a week in which youth and\r\nadults work together on coX1l\u0027ftUDity projectsa and also Mothers\u0027 Day, a day set\r\naside to honour and respect not only mothers but older people. In his\r\nspeeches my Life President has emphasized that youth must respect their elders.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl4r7/PlJr.40\r\n91\r\n(Mrs. Gondwe\u0027 Malawi)\r\nThis means that younger people shoulla lOlok after older relatives and consult\r\nthem for advice and wise counsel. This is the policy that has been guiding\r\nthe Government in dealing with the issue of ageing.\r\nThe Government of Malawi has therefore participated in many meetings 9n\r\nageing and contributed to the ideas on how to handle the problem of ageing\r\npopulations. It is with satisfaction and pride that we look back to 1982,\r\nwhen Malawi was part of tho process that gave rise to the Internation3l Plan\r\nof Action on Ageing. Indeed, it is in the same spirit that we have seen i~\r\nfit for the Government of Malawi to participate in this meeting on the tenth\r\nanniversary of the Plan of Action. We view the inclu~ion of the item on the\r\nagenda of the Assembly as an indication that the problem is taken seriously\r\nand therefore needs our support.\r\nWe must look back to the last 10 years and assess the impact of the Plan\r\nof Action. To us in Malawi, the Plan has created an additional level of\r\nI\r\nawareness of the impact of ageing and of the needs of the elderly in our\r\nsocieties that was not there before. This is the beginning of progress\r\ntowards finding solutions co the problems of ageing, and we feel that we\r\nshould not be discouraged because we have been unable to achieve all that we\r\nset ourselves to do. Rather, we should renew our resolve to deal adequately\r\nwith the issues involved in ageing and its effects on various aspects of the\r\nhuman experience. We therefore urge the United Nations and all its Members to\r\nstrengthen the existing programme on ageing, because some of us have not fully\r\nbenefitted from it.\r\n~ime is not on our side. Faced with many other problems, we may be\r\ntempted to relegate the question of ageing. But, as everyone knows,\r\npostponement of a problem .s not a solution; it will only come back bigger and\r\nin a worse form. Therefore, we need to act while there is time.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAJ47/PV.40\r\n92\r\n(Mrs. Gondve, Malawi)\r\nIt is said by the expft\u003dts that Africa will experience the impact of\r\nageing in significant proportions after the year 2025. This may give the\r\nfalse impression that we have time. We do not. Because of problems such as\r\nAIDS, demographic ageing may be realized sooner than later ia our societies.\r\nAt the rate AIDS is killing the younger and more economically active persons\r\nin our societies, the pace of ageing of the population has accelerated,\r\nimplying that this too is a priority problem. Rural to urban migration by\r\nyoung people, leading to the neglect of the elderly, is also an emerging\r\nproblem. In general, improvements in health and nutrition will lead to\r\nincreased life expectancy and contribute to the ageing phenomenon.\r\nThis therefore calls for efforts on our part to prepare ourselves. In\r\nI\r\nthis respect, the Malawi Government would like to reiterate its support for\r\nI\r\nall efforts made by the United Nations, Governments and i~stitutions designed\r\nto tackle the ageing issue and at the same time to request their assistance in\r\nhelping us to plan and develop strategies for dealing with it. Our\r\nachievements so far have been modest and have not really made the required\r\nimpact, because we are constrained financially and technically, However, at\r\nthe same time, our social and economic structures are changing rapidly, and\r\ntheir impact on vulnerable groups of society, such as the elderly, is\r\ngenerally negative.\r\nThe sheer size of the population of the aged in Malawi means that we\r\ncannot cope with the problem on our own. For example, in 1990 it was\r\nestimated that there were 341,409 people aged 60 years and over in ¥~lawi out\r\nof a total population of 8,288,900. The aged represent 4.11 per cent of the\r\ntotal population. This varies from 1.7 per cent to 5.9 per cent in certain\r\ndistricts within the country. Our current dependency ratio is 1:01, because\r\nwe have a generally young population. i~ese people have special needs that\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAI~7/PV.~O\r\n93\r\n(Mrs. GQndwe« Malawi)\r\nmust be addressed. These. figures vill increase in the future, and the\r\nrelative proportion of the elderly vill be much higher, thus imposing an even\r\nbigger burden on an already constrained economy and society.\r\nIn this vein, we vill be needing help in various ways, includinq\r\ntechnical assistance, finance mu! manpower development. My Government\r\napplauds the United Natiollls for taking the lead in this field, and would lite\r\nto support the continuation of the programme on ~~eing and its strengthening\r\nand ezpansion, all the more so a. the goals of the Plan of Action have not all\r\nbeen achieved. The existence of the onqoing programme is also one way to\r\nensure that attention to the problem is not overtaken by other priority needs.\r\nI would like to conclude by thantinq you, Sir, for your attention and for\r\ngiving priority to the problem of ageing. My Government vholly supports the\r\nUnited Nations efforts in uplifting the live. of the aged around the world.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 8 (~tiDUI4)\r\nADOPTION OF THE AGENDA AND ORGAHlZATIOIl OF MORI THIRD REPORT OF THE GBHERAL\r\nCOMMITTEE (Al47/250/Add.2)\r\nThe PRgSID¥e~ (interpret\u0026tlon from FrGnch)a 1 should like to drav\r\nthe attention of representatives to the third report 9f the General Committee\r\n(Al47/250/Add.2), which concern. the request made by the Philippines for the\r\ninclusion in the agenda of the current .e••ion of an additional item, entitled\r\n\"Emergency assistance to the Philippine....\r\nThe General Committee decided to recommend to the General Assembly that\r\nthe item should be include-J in the agenda.\r\nMay I take it that thR General Assembly decides to include in its Agenda\r\nthe additional item, entitled \"Emerqency assistance to the Philippines\"?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.40\r\n94\r\nTh\u0026 PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): The General Committee\r\nalso decided to recommend to the Assembly that this item should be considered\r\ndirectly in plenary meeting.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly adopts this recommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (iAterpretation from French): May I also take it that\r\nthe item should be considered with priority because of its urgent ~haracter?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): In this connection, I\r\nshould like to inform representatives that this item will be considered next\r\nweek at a date to be announced.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.20 p.m.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n"
