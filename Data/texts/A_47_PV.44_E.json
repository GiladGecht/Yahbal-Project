The brilliant\r\nscientific feat of Enrico Fermi in Chicago has left a deep imprint on the\r\nworld ever since. The development to which his discovery gave rise raised\r\nhopes at one stage for electricity generation \"to cheap to meter\". Later, it\r\nraised fears of the very extinction of humanity.\r\n(\r\nI\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.44\r\n9\r\n(Hr, Blixc Director General,\r\n!AlA)\r\nFor five decades we have lived with the d~al challenge of preventing the\r\nuse of the atom for weapons and of exploiting its many peace~uluses. For\r\nmost of its e%istenc~ the Unite~ ~ations has been inhibited in its actions by\r\na cold-war stalemate, the essence of which was an ever spiralling nuclear arms\r\nrace.\r\nThe IAEA was established 35 years ago to promote the peaceful of the atom\r\nfor development and to verify that commitments to exclusively peaceful uses\r\nwere respected. This has been in no small measure a successful operation,\r\npart of the reason being that the lAEA has had a high degree of pr~ctical\r\nEast/West cooperation despite the cold war. The intergovernmental activities\r\npursued in and through the lAEA have contributed to the evolution and\r\nworld-wide use of a bread range of nuclear applications, inclu~inq nuclear\r\npower plants generating some 17 per cent of the world\u0027s electricity. The\r\n~ctivities of the IAEA have also constituted an important part of the\r\ninternational efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.\r\nThe dual challenge which was presented by President Eisenhower in his\r\n\"Atoms for peace\" speech before the United Nations General Assembly in 1953 is\r\nstill valid. Last month the General Conference of the IAEA left no doubt that\r\nit wished the Agency to meet vigorously both challenges. It urged the Agency\r\nto continue promoting the use of nuclear technology, inter alia, through work\r\nin the fields of nuclear safety and waste disposal and through the\r\ndissemination of numerous nuclear techniques in the fields of medicine,\r\nagriculture and industry. .\\t the same time it welcomed the various measures\r\ntaken in in the past year t: strengthen the lAEA\u0027s safeguards system as a part\r\nof the challenge to reduce the risk of a further 6pread of nuclear weapons.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.44\r\n10\r\n(Hr. ~lix, Director GePlrol,\r\nBR)\r\nWhen in my report. today·I dftvote the larqest: part to safeguardlS and\r\nnon-pruliferatlon, it is because 1$0 much new has oc:;cuJ:\u0027lI:\u0027ed in this area in the\r\npast yea~, nut because larger resources or efforts have been devoted to it\r\ntha.\"1 to the prOllOtion of the peaceful applications of nuclear energy.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n- -,~---_._----\r\nAl47/PV.44\r\n11\r\n(Hr. Blix, Director General~\r\n.lAB)\r\nThus, the two challei\u0027lCj\u0027es of the early days of nuclear energy remain, but\r\ntoday\u0027s world is drastically different from that of the 19S0s. Most\r\nimportantly~ ~ a~~ moving into ~.vorld where, at long last~ less resources\r\nwill be used for military purpOSQS, including nuclear arsenals - a development\r\nthat favours non-proliferation. On the other hand, many new serious problems\r\nnow face humanity. Qne of them, which has a bearing on nuclear power, is the\r\nneed for groving energy production at a time vhen there iE increasing concern\r\nabout the effects upon the global climate of emissions of greenhouse qases,\r\nnotably the carbon diozide emissions that are associated with the use of all\r\nfossil fuels. I shall revert to this issue later.\r\nAt this point I should lite to address the issue of non-proliferation and\r\nthe lAEA\u0027s role in the efforts to prevent the further spread of nuclear\r\nweapons.\r\nToday the risk of military conflict between the qreat Powers is rapidly\r\nreceding, and the consequences in the form of disarmament, including\r\naccelerated nuclear disarmament, are as visible as they are welcome. The\r\neasier cooperation between the great Powers is also helping to settle many\r\nlong-standing local or reqional conflicts. This new climate and the process\r\nof democratization i~ a number of countries are factors which favour\r\nnon-proliferation. Let me cite some significant developments.\r\nArgentina and Brazil have decided to open all their nuclear installations\r\nto lAEA inspection, and following the recent adoption of some amendments there\r\nis a very good chance that the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons\r\nin Latin America - the Treaty of Tlatelolco - will come into force and make\r\nthe whole of Latin America a nuclear-weapon-free zone.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nW47/PV.44\r\n12\r\n(Mr. Bliz. Director General,\r\nDB)\r\nSouth Africa has joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT), and the !AEA has been invited to insspect all nuclear\r\ninstallations in that count~. In this new climate, African States are\r\nrenewing efforts to draft a treaty making Africa a nuclear-weapon-free zone.\r\nThe Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea has concluded the safeguards\r\nagreement required of it under the NPT, and the first inspections have taken\r\nplace. China and France have joined the NP\u0027r, so that the Treat.y is now\r\nsupported by all the declared nuclear-weapon States.\r\nIn the Middle East, there is new hope that peace talks will lead to\r\nagreement on a nuclear-weapon-free zone or a zone free of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. At the General Conference of the IABA last month a resolution\r\nwas adopted without a vote noting the consensus support for such a concept and\r\ncalling upon the Director General of the IAEA to continue consultations with\r\nGovernments in the region and work on a model for safeguards verification. I\r\nshall do so.\r\nA new wave of accessions to the NPT is coming, or expected to come, from\r\nStates that formerly were parts of the Soviet Union: the Baltic States,\r\nUkraine, Belarus and others. The lAEA is in contact with several of them in\r\norder to prepare for the application of lAEA safeguards.\r\nAll this augurs well for a succesaful conference in 1995 to extend the\r\nnon-proliferation Treaty. However, some other elements would be of signal\r\nimportance for achieving a ~niversal commitment by non-nuclear-weapon States\r\nto non-proliferation and an unlimited extension of the NPT. An agreement\r\nthrough which a date for the cessation of all nuclear testing was accepted by\r\nall nuclear-weapon States would be such an ~lement. It would signal that the\r\nworld would no longer tryout new and \"better\" nuclear: weapons. Another\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAI..?..,PV•••\r\n13\r\n(Hr. IsH... DiLector General,\r\nDB)\r\nhighly positive element: would :bG ea agreement on a cut-off of the production\r\nof fissionable material for weapons ptt.rp9sas. Such. an agreement would seem\r\nlogical in a world moving towards nuclear disanuu18nt - and perhaps not very\r\nburdensome in view of the difficulties which ezist today in disposing of\r\nsurplus weapons-grade material.\r\nThe foregoing considerations may seem too optimistic. Yet at no time\r\nsince disa~ament talks began hes the political climate seemed more favourable\r\nthan now for far-r~aching agreements.\r\nThe safeguards system which the IABA has now been operating for over\r\n25 years was the world\u0027s first on-site inspection system. It has great\r\nmerits, but also limitations. I shall discuss both, and I shall begin with\r\nsome thoughts on the potential further use of the system in the contezt of\r\nnuclear di8a~ament.\r\nGiven adequate resources, IABA safeguards could be employed to verify the\r\npeaceful storage or use of fissionable material that is recovered from the\r\ndismantling of nuclear weapons, if the world wants international assurances\r\nthat such material is not goin9 into Dew weapons. A cut-off of production of\r\nfissionable material for weapons purposes could also be v9rified by\r\ninternational safeguards. The safeguarding of enrichment and reprocessing\r\nplants, though a difficult task, is a problem to which much international work\r\nhas already been devoted and a task which is already ODe of the lAEA\u0027s duties.\r\nThere could also be renewed consideration of the concept of so-called\r\ninternational plutonium storage - that is to say, arrangements under which the\r\ngrowing quantities of separated plutonium from the peaceful cycle and\r\nquantities of plutonium expected from dismantled weapons would be subjected to\r\nspecial controls, which would give additional assurances concerninq\r\n___-J~£- ~ ~~----\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl411PV.44\r\n14\r\n(Mr. Blix. Director General,\r\n!AlA)\r\nnon-diversion and an exclusively peaceful use. The statute of the IAnA\r\nenvisages a function of this kind for the Agency.\r\nWhile the IAEA\u0027s safeguards system is a resou~ce that could be more\r\nextensively used by the international community, its limitations, too, must be\r\nconsidered - and remedied. In a world of fewer weapons there needs to be\r\ngreat confidence that no State is violating commitments and secretly producing\r\nfissionable material for weapons or, indeed, making new nuclear weapons.\r\nThe case of Iraq showed that it was possible in a very closed and\r\ncontrolled society to mount a sizeable secret effort for the enrichment of\r\nuranium and for weapons dev~lopment without this being detected by the\r\nsafeguards system. What can be done and what is being done to minimize the\r\nrisk of the same thing happening again in the future? Public discussion often\r\nfocuses on forcaful inspections. While these are important, it must be\r\nrecognized that information on where and what to inspect is the first and\r\nbasic requirement.\r\nIt is not possible for inspectors to visit and examine every building and\r\nbasement in a foreign country, and random visits will not help very much.\r\nInspectors must have access to information leading them to sites and\r\ninstallations of possible interest. In the case of post-war inspections in\r\nIraq, relevant information about sites has b~en obtained, through the United\r\nNations Special Commission, from Governments. In the strengthened safeguards\r\nsystem now taking shape in the IAEA, the information provided by the inspected\r\nState will be supplemented by other data, for instance data from other States\r\nconcer~ing the export and i,nport of nuclear material and certain types of\r\nequipment. Had such data regarding Iraq been available to the IAEA and\r\nanalysed, it is probable that special explanations and visits would have been\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nW4\u002711PV.44\r\n15\r\n(Mr. Vlis, Director GeLeral,\r\n!AlA)\r\nrequested by the Agency. Any data, wb.ather obtained by the IABA through its\r\nanalysis of declared nuclear activities or from external sources, must\r\nobviously be critically analysed and assessed to avoid unnecessary suspicions\r\nand false alarms.\r\nIt must be recognized that there is a special difficulty in verifying the\r\ncompleteness of a nuclear inventory when the IAEA is given this task in\r\nrespect of a n\"clea~ progrmrnne which has been going on in a territory for a\r\nlong time and has attained a certain size, as is at present the case in South\r\nAfrica and the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea and as will be the case\r\nin some countries which were parts of th9 Soviet Union.\r\nIn the case of South Africa, the General Assembly has requested tbe\r\nDirector General of the IAEA to report on the completeness of the inventory of\r\nSouth Africa\u0027s nuclear installations and material. The Agsncy has carried out\r\na large number of inspections of South African facilities aad locations\r\noutside declared facilities. It has carried out an extensive audit of\r\nhistorical operating and accounting ~ecords and performed a large number of\r\nanalyses. With the cooperation of the South African authorities, lAEA\r\ninspectors have been able to visit all the sites they asked to see - declared\r\nor not declared, military or civilian - and they have found no evidence that\r\nthe inventory is incomplete.\r\no\r\nHOor is the IAEA in possession of any other\r\ninformation suggesting the ~xistence of any undeclared facilities or nuclear\r\nmaterial. Naturally, if relevant information were obtained suggesting the\r\nneed for access to additional facilities, locations or data, the Agency would\r\nrequest such access. The report of the Agency on this matter has been\r\ntransmitted to the United, N~tions.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV,44\r\n16\r\n(Mr. Bliz. Dfr§ctor General,\r\n.DU)\r\nA problem similar to the one I have described reg~xding South Africa is\r\nencountered in the verification of the initial inventory presented by the\r\nDemocratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea under the safeguards agreement which\r\nentered into force on 10 April this year. Here, only three inspection\r\nmissions have been perform0d so far. and much work remains. Cer~ain steps\r\ntaken by the Damocratic People\u0027s Eepublic of Korea ha~e facilitated the task.\r\nSome o%iginal historical operating records have been provided for ozamination\r\nand analysis. klso, as in the case of South Africa, the Agency has been given\r\na standing invitation to send officials to sites and in~tallations regardless\r\nof whether th\u0026y are included in the initial declaration of the Democratic\r\nI1eople\u0027s Republic of Korea. Such invitat.ions, if lived up to in practice, are\r\nof co~rse uBeful. The Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea has cooperated\r\nwith us in organizing a visit by IAEA officials in September, and I expect\r\nprompt assistance will be offered in connection with a further visit. Over\r\ntime, the acceptance of such visits and openness and assistance to them will\r\nhelp to create a record of cooperation and transparency.\r\nA right of unimpeded access for inspectors to relevant sites and material\r\nis certainly of crucial importance when information is available suggesting\r\nthe need for inspection of specific sites. In the case of inspections in\r\nIraq, the United Nations and the IAEA have obtained the ~ight of unimpeded\r\naccess under Security Council resolution 687 (1991) and an exchange of letters\r\nof 14 May 1991 between the Secretary-General and the Foreign Minister of\r\nIraq. This right relates t·) any sites, installations, equipment, persons, or\r\ndocuments. In the case of routine IAEA safeguards inspections, rules exist\r\nwhich allow a recipient State to reject inspector designations and to subject\r\n,Digitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl41IPV.~\"\r\n11\r\n(Mr. Bl1z, Director GeDAEal,\r\nllIA)\r\nthe visit of inspec~ors to visa r~quirements. Once a designation has been\r\naccepted or a visa issued, however\u0027.. there is a right to visito\r\nI have repeatedly urS_\"\u0027\" that these restrictions be eliminated, th\u0026t all\r\nAgency inspectors be accepted as the international ci~il servants which they\r\nare, and that they be exempt from visa requirements and allowed entry on the\r\nbasis of a United Nations laissez-passer and a certificate indicating that\r\nthey are cuminq Qn inspection dut,.. Some p!\"lOq!\"ess has been mad5 towardl!!\r\nabolishing visa requirements or issuing multiple visas or accepting inspectors\r\nwithout a special designation procedure; but much remains to be done to\r\nfacilitate inspections.\r\nIn the past year the Board of Governors of the lAEA has confirmed the\r\nright of the Agency to perform special inspections when there are reason~ to\r\nbelieve that installations or material which should have bee~ declared have\r\nnot been so declared. No use has yet been made of this right.\r\nThere is no doubt that in the case of Iraq the readiness of the Security\r\nCouncil to support the right of unimpeded inspection has been of great\r\nimportance. It is reassuring that, in the summit statement of 31 January\r\n1992, the Council emphasized the int\u0026gral role in the implementation of the\r\nnon-proliferation Treaty of fully effective lAEA ~afeguards and that the\r\nmembers of the Council declared that they\r\n\"will talce appropriate measures in the case of any violations notlfiled to\r\nthem by the IAEA.\" (8/23500, Pp 4)\r\nThe relationship agreement ,f 14 November 1951 between the United Nations and\r\nthe !AEA contains rules all,~in; prompt interaction between the United\r\nNations, including the Security Council, and the IAEA. Any denial of access\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.44\r\n18\r\n(Mr. Blis. Director General,\r\n.DB)\r\nfor inspection or any other a~parent violations could speedily be placed\r\nbefore the Council.\r\nIn the case of lraq, the IAEA has now performed 14 inspection missions,\r\non which reports have been submitted to tbe Security Council through the\r\nSecretary-General. In response to the first task laid down by the Council,\r\nthat of mapping Iraq\u0027s nuclear progr8llll\\8, the Agency has been able ovel\u0027 the\r\npast year to put together a picture that is relatively consistent and\r\ncoherent. However, as the Iraqi authorities have refused to provide\r\ninformation on sources of foreign procurement and foreign technical advice,\r\nthere could still be missing elements in the picture. Inspections must\r\ncontinue of any sites or objects that may be designated by the United Nations\r\nSpecial Commission on the basis of new information that may beco~~ available\r\nto it. Some elements of the long-term monitoring have already been phased in\r\nside by side with investigative inspections. Considering that Iraq\u0027s\r\n)\r\nscientific and technical knowledge remains largely intact, such monitoring is\r\nclearly of great importance, the more so as the clandestine procurement\r\nnetwork is still in place.\r\nIt must be kept in mind, on the other hand, that the vast infrastructure\r\nneeded for any revival of a prohibited programme for the production of nuclear\r\nweapons and weapons-usable material in Iraq has been destroyed or rendered\r\nharmless, reservation being made for the possible continued existence of\r\nundetected installations.\r\nI now turn to the other side of the nuclear challenge, that of ezploiting\r\nthe peaceful applications of nuclear science and technology for development in\r\nmedicine, agriculture and industry. While at the time of Enrico Fermi\u0027s\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.44\r\n19\r\n(Mr. Bllx, Director General,\r\nlAD)\r\nexperiment in Chicago 50 years ago, \"nuclear\" mainly meant research and\r\nscience, ~e practical applications are now many and significant. Let me give\r\na few examples. I mentioned that, today, 17 per cent of the world\u0027s\r\nelectricity comes from nuclear-power reactors - slightly less than the\r\n20 per cent that comes from hydro power. Today every third patient in\r\nindustrialized countries is examined or treated by some nuclear-related\r\nmethod, either for therapy or diagnostic. Today, the cotton crop in Pakistan\r\nand the rice crop in Indonesia have been greatly boosted by the use of\r\nsuitable mutagens, that is to say, new strains produced through mutations\r\ninduced by irradiating seeds. Today, nuclear methods are used in animal\r\nhusbandry to measure the efficiency of protein uptake from various locally\r\navailable foodstuffs. Based on such measurements, optimum combinations of\r\nlocal feeding materials for buffaloes have been introduced in India and\r\nIndonesia, which has led to a dramatic increase in buffalo milk and meat\r\nproduction.\r\nI shall Dot prolong this list of examples of nuclear techniques which\r\nhelp to maintain or restore health, boost industrial production and promote\r\nthe production and preservation of food. I should underline, however - in\r\nview of the expectations of the Rio Conference on Environment and Development\r\nthat all organizations in t\"\u00271e United Nations family should contribute to the\r\nfulfilment of the Agenda 21 - that nuclear techniques have a remarkably wide\r\nuse not only in development but also in the monitoring and protection of the\r\nenvironment. Let me give two examples of this.\r\nIsotopes a~e a powerful tool in the fight against groundwater and soil\r\ncontamination through exces\u0026ive use of fertilizers. They allow precise\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.44\r\n20\r\n(Mr. Bli;, Director General,\r\nlAEA)\r\nmeasurement of the amount of fertilizer that goes into the plant, so that the\r\nmost appropriate fertilizer regime can be established for any particular\r\nagronomic systam. Similarly, nuclear techniques allow the determination of\r\nthe amount of nitrogen which different crop plants obtain from the soil. This\r\nhas not only led to the development of better fertilizer strategies but also\r\nhelped in the selection of the most officient nitrogen-fixing plant va~ieties\r\nwithin each speciss, reducing the need for nitrogen fertilizer, to the benefit\r\nof the environment and the economy of the countries involved.\r\nMost controversial - but also most interesting - is the question of how\r\nhelpful nuclear power is and could be in generating the increasing amounts of\r\nelectricity which the world will need without emitting carbon dioxide into the\r\natmosphere and thereby contributing to a possible global warming.\r\nThe Framework Convention on Climate Change which was signed at Rio soeks\r\nto stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations, but does not prescribe how this is\r\nto be done or set any targets concerning C02 emissions or other greenhouse qas\r\nemissions. There is no doubt that global development will require the use of\r\nmore energy, especially electricity, and that a dilemma is inherent in the\r\ncircumstance in which an increased use of fossil fuels, today\u0027s dominant\r\nenergy source, would set us on a collision course with the probable need to\r\nreduce emissions of carbon dioxide. There is a growing awareness that the\r\nsaving of energy and greater use of renewable sources of energy, like solar\r\npower and wind power, will be very inaOequate responses to this dilemma.\r\nThere is also a growing awareness that the continued and, indeed,\r\nexpanded use of nuclear energy is one of the few options at tha world\u0027s\r\ndisposal for increasing ene:gy generation without significantly adding to\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n---..,......\".,.....,........,........,--~---....,,, ,._-----\r\nAl471fV.44\r\n20(8-.)\r\n(Mr, Bl!z, Director General,\r\nlAD}\r\ncarbon 4101£i4e ..baio:!la.

Blix. pirector General,\r\nlAD.)\r\nIt is still true, however, that the usa or ezpanded use of nuclear power\r\nis opposed by a sizeable segment of public opinion in many countries, mainly\r\nfor fear of radioactive releases from an. accident or from the disposal over\r\nlong periods of time of nuclear waste~.\r\nComparisons with the risks associated with the generation of energy\r\nthrough coal, hydro power, gas or oil are certainly relevant and should be\r\ncarried C)ut to provide a basis for rational discussion. However, we must be\r\naware thl!lt the public might find damage to health and the environment thruugh\r\nradiatio~ leas tolerable than injury through coal-mine accidents, the bursting\r\nof hydro dams or the explosion of gas cisterns. This is also the premise upon\r\nwhich extensive international co-operation is now taking place within and\r\noutside the lAEA to strengthen safety worldwide in th(. operation of nuclear\r\npower plants and in the disposal of radioactive waste.\r\nIn a year\u0027s time I hope a draft convention on nuclear safety will be\r\nready, containing rules which will be legally binding on all States adhering\r\nto it. It is currently being negotiated within the lAEA, as recomm9nded by\r\nthe Rio Conference. The attainment of a nuclear safety culture embracing all\r\ncountries operating nuclear power plants is also the objective of present\r\nefforts to assist countries in Eastern Europe to upgrade nuclear power plants\r\nor in some cases, where this may not be feasible or economic, to phase them\r\nout.\r\nAgenda 21 of the Rio Conference contains a chapter on the safe and\r\nenvironmentally sound management of radioactive wastes. Let me report in this\r\nregard that a code of practice on the international transboundary movement of\r\nradioactive waste was adopted by the IAEA in 1990. While cases have occurred\r\nin which chemical wastes have been exported to developing countries, no such\r\nI\r\n1\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nl\r\nI\r\n,\r\n(~lix« Director General,\r\nIAD)\r\ncase has been found in,,\"olving radioactive wastes. I should add that, at the\r\nrequest of developing countries\" experts sent by the IAEA have investigated\r\nseveral cases - and found chealcal uaste but not radioactive waste.\r\nI should also report that intensified efforts are under way in the lAEA\r\nto work out a comprehensive series of internationally agreed radioactive waste\r\nsafety standards which may form the basis of, or complement, national\r\nstandards and criteria. It is reasonable to require that radioactive waste be\r\ndisposed of with the same level of safety all over the world, and regardless\r\nof whether the wastes originate in military or civilian programmes.\r\nIf px\u0027esent efforts to ensure a uniformly high level of safety in the\r\noperation of uuclear power plants and in the disposal of radioactive waste\r\naround the world continue to be vigorously pursued within and outside the\r\nlAEA, I believe that the expanded use of nuclear power, which may become\r\nindispensable, may also become fully acceptable to \"Nst people.\r\nLet me conclude with some comments not on the past year but on the\r\nlong-term role of the IAEA. International organizations are mechanisms\r\nthrough which Governments jointly meet international challenges. I would\r\nsubmit that over the years the lAEA has been a useful and efficient tool of\r\nits member States.\r\nThe energy crisis focused attention on the practical and potential use of\r\nnuclear power and the role of the lAEA. The Chernobyl crisis led the lAEA to\r\nlaunch the concept and principles of a nuclear safety culture accepted and\r\nrespected by all; in the environment crisis, the lAEA has been able to show\r\nthat peaceful nuclear applications, inclUding the use of nuclear power for\r\nelectricity generation, are of crucial value both for the environment and for\r\ndevelopment; in the Iraqi crisis, the lAEA has helped the United Nations to\r\nneutralize the nascent nuclear weapon capacity.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.44\r\n23\r\n(Mr. Blixc Director Gen§ral,\r\nIABA)\r\nThe Aqency is also learning the broader lessons of Iraq and strengthening\r\nthe verification system in order to increase the probability that any\r\nviolation will be detected and be dealt with by the Security Council, to which\r\nthe lABA reports in these matters.\r\nAs the lABA is obliged to undertake increasing activities in the fields\r\nof technology transfers, nuclear safety and safeguards, the organization -\r\nlike the United Nations - ought to be spared financial crises. This year we\r\nhave been forced to reduce our activities in order to manage a shortfall of no\r\nless than 13 per cent of our budget, due to uon-~ayment, in particular by a\r\nlarge contributor. Such financial crisis management in an organization\r\ninevitably undermines its capacity to address the serious issues it is asked\r\nto deal with.\r\nThe ongoing erosion of pay levels for 0,1\u0027 staff also reduces our ability\r\nto attract staff of the required calibre. I Submit that more mileage will be\r\nobtained from the mechanisms that Governments create for our joint journey\r\ninto the future if these mechanisms are adequately financially fuelled and\r\nmanaged by well-motivated and competent crews.\r\nLastly, I should like to express in this forum the thanks of the lAEA to\r\nthe Government of Austria, which is an excellent host to all the international\r\norganizations located in Vienna.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I call on the representative of Australia to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/47/L.9/Rev.l.\r\nMr. O\u0027SQLLIVAN (Australia): I have the honour to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/47/L.9/Rev.l on the annual report of the lAEA (A/47/374).\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAI..7/PV.....\r\n2..\r\n(Mr. O\u0027SulliYan, AustW!!!)\r\nThe following countries have joined the 32 sponsors listed in document\r\nAl47/L.9/Rev~1: Japan, the Republic of KOrea, Costa Rica, Latvia, Botswana\r\nand Turkey.\r\nI should like to explain first that Australia is introducing the draft\r\nresolution on behalf of the sponsors because it wa~ requested to do so by a\r\nnumber of interested delegati4)ns. We are not this year a member of the lAEA\r\nBureau, the group that traditionally manages the draft resolution. However,\r\nwe were a member of the Bureau in 1991 and we ara strongly committed to the\r\nlAEA, its role and its future.\r\nThi.s year, unfortunately, there was no agreement in the Bureau about\r\nintroducinq a draft resolution on the IAEA. Obviously, there had to be such a\r\ndraft resolution. In the circumstances, Australia was prepared to take on the\r\ntask of introducing it, and there was no objection from this year\u0027s Bureau to\r\nour so doing. We have consulted widely, and we believe this draft resolution\r\nbroadly reflects a common view.\r\nThe pa~t year has been an important one for the IAEA. In all its areas\r\nof activity with regard to nuclear non-proliferation and strengthening the\r\nsafeguards system, the year saw the signatu~e of safeguards agreements by\r\nSouth Africa, Argentina, Brazil and the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea,\r\nand the initiation within the Boar6 of Governors of a series of measures\r\ndesigned to strengthen the safeguards system.\r\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferatio~of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the\r\nAgency\u0027s safe~lards systems together constitute the principal international\r\nassurance of the peaceful uses of _~clear energy. The safeguards system is\r\nfundamental to nuclear non-proliferation, and the measures initiated in\r\n1991 are very encouraging, both for the future of the safeguards system itself\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.46\r\n25\r\n(Hr.

Safety standards are\r\nconstantly being developed and upqraded by the Agency, not least in response\r\nto public perceptions concerninq the benefits and risks associated with\r\nnuclear snerqy. Nork has n01l col\u0027l\u0027l\u0027ftenced on an international nuclear safety\r\nconvention, and in 1991 a document vas published on the desiqn deficiencies of\r\ncertain reactor plants that provides a basis for operators and requlatory\r\nbodies alike co develop a proqramme for enhancinq safety at these plants.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI\r\nI\r\nAl47/PV.44\r\n26\r\n(Mr. Y\u0027$u1liyan. Australia)\r\nThere have also been important developments in technical assistance and\r\ncooperation activities, where the potential benefits of nuclear technology\r\ncontinue to be demonstrated in a variety of applications. In addition to\r\nthose mentioned just now by the Director General of the IAEA, there are other\r\nexamples. The use of the sterile-insect technique has enabled the new-world\r\nscrew worm fly to be eradicated from North Africa. That pest, which had\r\nbecome established in Libya, posed a threat to livestock throughout Africa and\r\nthe Mediterranean. Other application techniques resulted in improved crop\r\nyields, improvements in nuclear-medicine capabilities, and greater inte~est in\r\nenvironmental monitoring.\r\n~urning now to this year\u0027s draft resolution, we wish to note that it is\r\nsubstantially the same as the resolution adopted in 1991. In paragraph 4, we\r\nwould emphasize the centrality of strengthened safeguards to international\r\nsecurity, regional security and technical cooperation. In paragraph 5, we\r\nwould draw attention to the Agency\u0027s actions in strengthening technical\r\nassistance and cooperation activities. In paragraph 6 r we would emphasize\r\nthat the Agency is continuing to do very valuable and dangerous work in Iraq,\r\nwhich we believe requires recognition by the General Assembly, arising as it\r\ndoes from the first blatant breach of an IAEA and/or non-proliferation Treaty\r\n(NPT) safeguards agreement; and also that effective fulfilment of Security\r\nCouncil resolutions is es~ential for the continued effectiveness of the\r\nnon-proliferation regime and the assurances it provides to all members of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe commend this draft resolution\" which has attracted a broad\r\nsponsorship, to delegations. It is a balanced text and seeks to be responsive\r\nto the needs and interests of all IAEA members. Above all, it is in our\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.44\r\n27\r\n(Mr. Q·Sullivan.

These have been and remain the\r\nfundamental tasks of the Agency.\r\nThe maintenance of an appropriate balance in its activities has always\r\nbeen a major prerequisite both for the general support lAEA enjoys on the part\r\nof its member States and for its growing international prestige. Hungary\r\ncontinues to believe that the International Atomic Energy Agency plays a\r\npre-eminent role in all its fields of activity and is firmly convinced that\r\nthe latest developments in international relations open up new possibilities\r\nfor the Agency and at the same time pose new challenges for it.\r\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the lAEA\r\nsafeguards system together constitute an important international guarantee of\r\nthe peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We have witnessed important new\r\ndevelopments indicating the overall str~ngthening of the nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation regime.

We expect the\r\nStates parties to the NPT to conclude full-scope safeguards agreements with\r\nthe IAEA without any delay and hope that similar steps will soon be taken by\r\nother States not yet parties to the Treaty. It is the firm and definite\r\nposition of the Hungarian Government that the newly emerging States cannot\r\nserve the fundamental interests of their own peoples and the global interests\r\nof peace, security and development unless they become parties to the\r\nnon-proliferation Treaty without any undue delay. The recent accession of\r\n8stonia and Lithuania to the Treaty and the conclusion of the respective\r\nsafeguards agreements by them are promising\u0027 siqns in this respect. At tha\r\n1995 NPr extension Conference, where we shall strongly argue for the\r\nindefinite extension of the Treaty, we should lite to see these positive\r\nmeasures further strengthened.\r\nIn view of the renewed global interest in nuclear non-proliferation, the\r\nIAEA safeguards system continues to be of crucial importance. Hungary has\r\nalways accorded high priority to the continuous improvement and strengthening\r\nof that system. Now, after Iraq\u0027s non-compliance with its safeguards\r\nobligations, and when the IAEA safeguards system faces new challenges owing to\r\nthe disintegration of the Soviet Union, it is imperative to increase the\r\nability of the safeguards system to detect any possible undeclared nuclear\r\nactivity and to render the safeguards system capable of carrying out its\r\nactivities - whose scope has widened - with respect to declared nuclear\r\nfacilities.

The\r\nresults ef the 14 on-site inspection missions have proven that the concerns of\r\nthe international community about the Iraqi nuclear programme ¥ere\r\nwell-founded, and the resolute international action against such a violation\r\nof Treaty obligations was justified. The remaining questions about the Iraqi\r\nnuclear programme are to be clarified. The mandate given by the Security\r\nCouncil regarding the long-term monitoring activity to verify Iraq\u0027s\r\ncompliance with the requirements of the relevant Security Council resolutions\r\nremains an essential task for the Agency.\r\nThe issues of nuclear safety have always been high on the agenda of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. Recently, a broad set ~f !~ternational\r\nand bilateral programmes was launched, with the participation of various\r\ninternational organizations and the highly industrialized countries, to\r\nprovide assistance in the field of nuclear safety to Central and Eastern\r\nEuropean countries. We believe that the long experience of IAEA cooperation\r\nwith these co~t~ies, as well as the professional knowledge the Agency has\r\naccumulated, are of great value and should be used in a proper way. In this\r\ncontext, we welcome the efforts to avoid duplication in providing\r\nsafety-related assistance and to increase the effectiveness of such\r\nassistance. We lend our support to the Agency in creating appropriate\r\nmechanisms for its active participation.\r\nHungary appreciates th~ Agency\u0027s work in promoting the necessary legal\r\nbasis for the strengthening of nuclear safety. Significant preparatory work\r\nhas been launched by the lAEA to elaborate a nuclear-safety Convention•\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.44\r\n32\r\n(M!:. Gajda, HungarY)\r\nAlthough the national authorities are, and should remain, responsible for the\r\nsafe operation of nuclear facilities, there is no doubt that an international\r\ncommitment by the participating States to the provisions of such a Convention\r\nwould be an important step towards improving nuclear safety all over ~~a\r\nworld. In this connection, my Government is extremely concerned about the\r\nneed for adequate physical protection of nuclear materials, and is doing\r\neverything in i~s power to prevent Hungary from becoming thG scene of illegal\r\ntransit of nuclear materials. At the First Review Conference of the States\r\nParti~\u003d to the Convention on the Phy5ical Protection of Nuclear Material, we\r\nnoted, therefore, with satisfaction, the increased number of States Parties to\r\nthe Convention, as well as -the positive outcome and successful work of the\r\nConference.\r\nWe are also pleased to note that the international legislative framework\r\nfor nuclear liability has been strengthened by the entry into force of the\r\nJoint Protocol to the Vienna and Paris Conventions, elaborated and adopted\r\nwith the active participation of the Agency.\r\nThe Hungarian Gove~nment highly appreciates the Agency\u0027s work in the\r\nfield of technical assistance and cooperation. International cooperation has\r\nbeen vital for the development of our nuclear industry, research and\r\neducation. It has not only contributed to achieve the present, widely\r\nrecognized high standards in nuclear sciences but also made our institutions\r\ncapable of transferring our knowledge and experience to countries less\r\ndeveloped in the nuclear field.

This is a convincing figure, underscoring\r\nthe importance of nuclear energy for our economy. In spite of th5 excellent\r\noperational record of our nuclear power plant, we are continuously reassessing\r\nand u~aating the nuclear safety and operational practice of the plant. In\r\nthis activity, we continue to rely on the Agency\u0027s cooperation. Apart from\r\nthe traditional services, like the missions of the Operational Safety Review\r\nTea-on (OSART) and of the Analysis of Safety-Significant Bvents Team (ASSET), we\r\nencourage the secretariat to broaden its services ~o the member States in such\r\nvital fields as spent fuel mlUlagement and radioactive w(ste disposal.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to express our appreciation to the Director General\r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mr. Rans 81ix, and his staff for\r\ntheir excellent work during the previous yaar.\r\nMr. RQV Zhitong (China) (interpretation from Chinese): The Chinese\r\ndelegation has listened very carefully to the statement made by Mr. Hans 81ix,\r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and has\r\nstudied the Agency\u0027s annual report seriously. Over the past year, the Agency\r\nhas done a great deal of work, and made positive efforts in such important\r\nfields as safeguards, peaceful uses of nuclear energy and nuclear safety. We\r\nare satisfied with these re~ults.\r\nThe promotion of international cooperation in the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy is an imperative task for the Agency. Nuclear energy, as a\r\nclean and reliable alternative source of energy, has broad prospects. Many\r\ncountries, particularly the developing countries, ~eed urgently to develop\r\nnuclear energy in order to develop their economy and protect the environment •\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.44\r\n34-35\r\n(Mr. Rou Zbitong. China)\r\nTherefore, we hope the Agency will sake a greater contribution to promotinq\r\nthe peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\r\nThe implementation of safeguards with a view to preventinq nuclear\r\nproliferation is another important sission of the IAXA. In order to ensure\r\nthe peaceful uses of nuclear energy, it is necessary to make the acceptance of\r\nlAEA safeguards a precondition for international nuclear energy cooperation.\r\nThe Aqency has done much work in this field, and has accumulated rich\r\nexperience, continuously improvinq the safeguards reqime and makinq it the\r\nuniversally acceptable measure against nuclear proliferation.\r\nEvidently, it is a complicated and demandinq task for the IAEA both\r\nfurther to promote international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nenergy and to implement the safeguards. The Chinese deleqation is of the view\r\nthat the Aqency\u0027s two functions should be assiqned equal weiqht. Neither can\r\nbe neglected, and still less can the two be pitted aqainst each other;\r\notherwise, the further development of the IAXA would inevitably be affected.\r\nChina supports the Aqency\u0027 s work in safecr.aards. At the same time, we \u0026lso\r\nbelieve it is impermissible to allow the use of any excuse to infrlnqe upon\r\nthe legitimate rights and interests of any country, especially the developing\r\ncountries, in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\r\nI\r\nI\r\n{\r\nl\r\n\\\r\n•\r\n---- 1 _\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI Al47/PV.44\r\n36\r\n(Mr. Rou Zhitong, China)\r\nYet what should be noted here iD the fact that some people put\r\ndisproportionately heavy emphasis on the prevention of nuclear proliferation\r\nwhile ove~lookin9 and misrepresenting the legitimate demands of the developing\r\ncountries for cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear e~ergy. Some\r\nindividual countries even go so far as to restrict such cooperation under the\r\npretext of preventing proliferation, in an attempt to monopolize nuclear\r\ntechnology and nuclear euergy. Undoubtedly, such a practice not only affects\r\nthe economic and social development of developing countries but is also of no\r\nhelp to international efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. There£ore~\r\nthe tendency should be rGctified.\r\nIt is known to all that China\u0027s consistent policy has been not to\r\nadvocate, encourage or engage in nuclear proliferation nor to help other\r\ncountries develop nuclear weapons. China\u0027s nuclear export strictly abides by\r\nthe following three principles, namely, assurance for peaceful purposes,\r\nacceptance of the IAEA\u0027s safeguards and no retransfer to a third country.\r\nChina has officially acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons. China has taken an active part in the international cooperation in\r\nthe peaceful uses of nuclear energy, signing, from 1980 to 1986,\r\nintergovernmental agreements for ~uclear energy cooperation with 11\r\ncountries. Recently, China and the Islamic Republic of Iran signed an\r\nintergovernmental agreement on cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nenergy.

The ezamplary manner in which Director General Rans 8liz has been\r\nconducting the work of his Agency merits our gratitude and respect.\r\nThe Austrian Government has always held the view that on the way towards\r\na nuclear-weapon-free world a non-profileration regime is an essential step\r\nand that the IAEA has an indispensable role to play in that regime. We are\r\nglad to note that the regime has been broadened in important regards.\r\nFrance and China have acceeded to the non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) as\r\nnucle~~-weaponStates, so that all nuclear-weapon States in the terms of that\r\nTreaty have now become parties to it. South Africa and the Democratic\r\nPeople\u0027s Republic of Korea have joined the Treaty and concluded safeguards\r\nagreements with the IAEA.\r\nWe also appreciate that the Ukraine, 8elarus and Kazakhstan have declared\r\ntheir intention to join the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States. We are looking\r\ntowards 1995, when the NPT Review Conference will give us an opportunity to\r\nrenew our faith in the need of this Treaty for a peaceful world order and to\r\nremove its time limits.\r\nThe non-proliferation regime has also been greatly strengthened by the\r\nimportant developments that have taken place in Latin America in that\r\nrespect. The full-scope safeguards agreement between Argentina, Bra~il and\r\nthe Agency is an important step towards the establishment of a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in Latin America in accordance with the T~eaty of\r\n\u0027.Tlatelolco.\r\nI\r\nI\r\n!\r\nI\r\n1\r\nr\r\n\\\r\ni,\r\n!\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI\r\nI\r\nI\r\nA/471PV.44\r\nS6\r\n(Mr. Hajnoczi, Austria)\r\nThe importance of an effective verification regime with regard to the\r\nobligations of the non-proliferation Treaty has been highlighted by Iraq\u0027s\r\nfailure to live up to its obligations under the Treaty and its safeguards\r\nagreement with the IAEA.\r\nThe close collaboration between the Agency and the Security Council in\r\nthis matter has resulted in the implementation of measures that were the\r\nnecessary consequence of Iraq\u0027s gross breach of international obligations.\r\nThe Director General and his staff have earned our admiration for their\r\nexcellent performance in implementing the tasks entrusted to them by the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe IAEA will continue to pla,y an important part in the process of making\r\nthe NPT obligations effective and ensuring that nuclear development will not\r\nbe used for other than peaceful purposes.\r\nThe activities of the IAXA are essential for rebuilding international\r\nfaith in the workability of a non-profileration regime.\r\nWhen the term \"nuclear energy\" i8 used, it is sometimes - and\r\nerroneously - equated with nuclear power. But as everyone who follows the\r\nactivities of the Agency knows, there are many non-power uses of nuclear\r\nenergy, and the IAEA\u0027s promotion of these is viewed as particularly\r\nsignificant by many countries. Any assessment of the role of the IAEA has to\r\nbring out the fact that the use of nuclear energy in the fields of medicine,\r\nscience and technology is raising the standards of living worldwide.\r\nThat distinction is important for Austria, whose Parliament, on the basis\r\nof a referendum held in 1978, has adopted legislation forbidding the use of\r\nnuclear-fission energy for the purpose of power production in Austria.\r\nj\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n]\u0027..!o!7!~\u003d44\r\n39\r\n(Mr. H~noczi, Austria)\r\nIt is a policy of the Austrian Government to make this decision known to\r\nother members of the international community and to inform them of the reasons\r\nthat have led to it in the hope that our example will be followed by other\r\nStates, especially our neigbboursn\r\nBut whereas views on nuclear-power production differ, there can be only\r\none view regarding the necessity of making nuclear plants as safe as possible\r\nso long as they exist. Austria, therefore, welcomes the activities of the\r\nIAEA in this respect, and particularly those concerning nuclear plants in\r\nCentral and Eastern Europe. There is today a much wider awareness of the\r\ndangers arising from the continued existence of those reactors and of the need\r\nfor urgent corrective action.\r\nIt is not surprising that in an international organization of 113 States\r\ndifferent views should be held on the order of priority of its aims. Some of\r\nits objectives will find general acclaim, while others will be a matter of\r\ndisagreement.\r\nThat fact, however, does not prevent us from appreciating, especially in\r\nthe light of the past year\u0027s experience, the importance of the IAEA as an\r\nessential part of the organized international community in its search for\r\npeace.\r\nMr. GQUDlMA (Ukraine): First of all, my delegation would like to\r\nexpress its appreciation to Mr. Blix, Director General of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and to his staff for their excellent work in the\r\nperiod under review.\r\nThe report submitted to the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly\r\nby ~e International Atomic Energy 1gency contains detailed information\r\nconcerning the activities of this organization in 1991.

In these conditions the role of the IAEA\r\nis of special ~ignificance, as the Agency is designed to promote international\r\ncooperation in the safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy, to monitor its\r\nuse, ensuring that it is not used for military purposes, and to render\r\npractical assistance within its competence to developing countries as well as\r\nto countries in transition.\r\nOf special relevance today is the issue of non-proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons. The delegation of Ukraiu.e commends the IAEA for its role in\r\nimplementing the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). In\r\nthis connection, I remind the Assembly that Ukraine, which recently celebrated\r\nthe first anniversary of its independence, bases its policy on\r\nnon-participation in military blocs and observance of the three non-nuclear\r\nprinciples: not to accept, produce or acquire nuc~ear weapons. Ukraine has\r\nresolutely set out on the road to non-nuclear status and takes consistent\r\nmeasures to reach this.goal. In May 1992 all tactical nuclear weapons were\r\nwithdrawn from Ukrainian territory. On our insistence, Ukraine exercised\r\neffective control over the process of dismantling the nuclear weapons\r\nwithdrawn from our territory.\r\nAfter signing the Protocol to the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty in\r\nLisbon on 23 May 1992, Ukraine pledged to ratify the Treaty in the very near\r\nfuture and to accede to the NPT as a non-nuclear State. The Ukrainian\r\nGovernment submitted the required documents to the Verkhovna Rad, the\r\ncountry\u0027s Parliament, for consideration, and we hope that the decisions on the\r\nratification and the accession of Ukraine to these Treaties will be taken soon.\r\nL\r\nI\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI\r\n..\r\n),,-147IPV044-\r\n42\r\n(Mr. Goudima. Ukraipe)\r\nOur delegation deeply appreciates the Agency\u0027s activi.tiea on the\r\nimplementation of its safeguards, which assume particular significance in the\r\nframework of the nuclear disarmament process. We also support the Agency~s\r\nefforts to develop further the system of comprehensive safeguards.\r\nIntensive work is under way in Ukraine on matters that form the basis of\r\nthe non-proliferation regime, such as creating a national accounting and\r\ncontrol system for nuclear materials, improving the physical protection of\r\nsuch materials and developing a control system for nuclear imports and\r\nexports. As wo lack the necessary competence and maans, ho~avar, ~a would ba\r\nmost grateful to other countries and to the Agency for assistance in creating\r\nthe organizational and technical conditions that would allow us to accede to\r\nthe NPT as soon as possible and to conclude an agreement on safeguards with\r\nthe IAEA. As this work will require some time, our Government has confirmed\r\nits readiness to put under the Agency\u0027s safeguards immediately Ukraine\u0027s\r\nnuclear installations used for peaceful purposes. We are satisfied that a\r\nproper solution to this question was found at the last session of the IAEA\u0027s\r\ngoverning body.\r\nThe member States of the Commonwealth of Independent States have signed\r\nan agreement entitled \"The Main Principles of Cooperation in the Field of\r\nPeaceful Use of Nuclear Energy\". The agreement, which has already come into\r\nforce. is based on the principles of non-proliferation. As a party to the\r\nagreement, Ukraine has endorsed the proposal to convene the first coordinating\r\nmeeting of the competent bodies of the participating countries.\r\nUkraine commends the AJency\u0027s efforts to strengthen international\r\ncooperation in the field of nuclear and radiation safety. Mr. Sliz, Director\r\nGeneral of the IAEA, was absolutely right in stating at the 1991 session of\r\nJ\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAJ41/PV.44\r\n43\r\n(Mr. Goudima, Ukraine)\r\nthe Agency\u0027s General Conference that there was a real need to transform\r\ninternational activity in the field of nuclear safety into an international\r\nregimeQ It is evident that a serious accident at any nuclear power station\r\ntoday would discredit the very idea of the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\r\nThat is why the IAEA efforts to work out the fundamental principles of nuclear\r\nand ·radiation. safety and to create a coordinated programme of cooperation in\r\nthis field are entirely justified. In this regard, we support the Agency\u0027s\r\nendeavours to elaborate a convention on nuclear safety and to review the main\r\nsafety standards of radiation protection, and we hope that this work will soon\r\nbe completed with the adoption of relevant documents.\r\nUkraine is involved to the fullest possible extent in the creation of an\r\ninternational nuclear safety regime. The consequences of the tragedy et the\r\nChernobyl nuclear power station in April 1986, which affected our peoples and\r\nterritories and those of neighbouring States, are still deeply felt in\r\nUk~aine. A complex of measures to diminish the consequences of the accident\r\nis being implemented by the Ukraine Government, although current political and\r\neconomic transformati.ons have no doubt affected the efficiency of this work.\r\nWe take this opportunity to express our appreciation to the world community\r\nfor understanding and assistance in dealing with these problems.\r\nThe results of the International Chernobyl Project, addressed in the\r\nannual report of the lAEA, have elicited considerable interest in our country\r\nand abroad. While those results have been evaluated in various ways, we\r\nconsider it important to note that the lAEA did la good job of implementing a\r\nproject on such a scale wit~in a short time. We feel, however, that the\r\nproject did not fully and adequately reflect a number of problems caused by\r\nChernobyl. These problems might form the basis of the Agency\u0027s\r\nChernobyl-related activities in the future.\r\nI\r\nf\r\n\\\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.44\r\n44\r\n(Mr. Goudima, Ukraine)\r\nIn the Agency\u0027s programme of activities for 1993-1994 we found only one\r\nsubprogramme - entitled \"Radiological Consequences of the Chernobyl\r\nAccident\" - directly related to the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. A\r\nnumber of other important scientific and technical issues that fall within the\r\ncompetence of the Agency, such as the problems of long-life radiation\r\ncontamination, methods for decrea~inq the radiation background of large\r\nterritorie~ and the influence of low radiation doses on biological objects,\r\nwere not included. We feel that given the complez and diverse problems raised\r\ncould more fully participate in solving these problems.\r\nI should also like to draw attention to the problem of the shelter over\r\nthe damaged fourth block of the Chernobyl nuclear power station, known as the\r\n\"Sarcophagus\". As its current condition gives every reason for anziety, an\r\ninternational contest has been announced to find the best possible solution to\r\nthe problem. We hope that experts from many countries .of the world will\r\nparticipate.\r\nI should now like to say a few words about the problems of Ukraine\u0027s\r\nnuclear energy industry, which is in a difficult condition. After the\r\ncollapse of the Soviet Union, its multiple scientific, technical and\r\nproductive ties were disrupted; the centralized system of management and\r\nsupervision of the safety of nuclear installations ceased to ezist. A\r\nnational system to ensure the safe transportation of radioactive substances ia\r\nneeded. This is important, not only for us, but for others, since fresh and\r\nprocessed nuclear fuel is transported through Ukrainian territory to Russia,\r\nCzechoslovakia, Hungary and BUlgaria. We have inherited particularly\r\ncomplicated problems in tre~ting processed nuclear fuel. New conditions in\r\n1 _\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nthe nuclear energy complez have made it necessary to reasseC8 the problems of\r\nthe nuclear fuel cycle of Ukraine as a whole.\r\n~o overcome these difficulties we need well-coordinated assistance from\r\ni~dustriclly developed countries. We are also interested in assistance from\r\nthe IAEA in creating in Ukraine the regime for nuclear regulation that has\r\nbeen developed, as well as in solving other problems relating to nuclear\r\nactivity in our country.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to stress again that Ukraine supports the\r\nmultifaceted activities of the International Atomic Energy Agency and will\r\npromote in every way possible the accomplishment of the ezceptionally\r\nimportant tasks that the Agency faces today.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.44\r\n47\r\n(Mr. Daba, Pakistan)\r\nThe assistance prcvlded to the developing countries by the Ac;ency in\r\nassessing their need for nuclear power is highly commendable. The application\r\nef nuclear technology ilP the fields of food, agriculture, livestock, medicine\r\nand physical sciences has proved to be eztremely useful in the efforts of the\r\ndeveloping countries aimed at attaining socin-economic development. In this\r\ncontezt one of the Agency\u0027s major successes in 1991 was tho eradication of the\r\nscrewworm flies from North Africa.\r\nWe note from the Agency\u0027s report that DDT dissipates 30-40 times faster\r\nin tropical environments than in temperate regions, suggesting that it could\r\nperhaps be used in certain developing countries. However, in our view, while\r\nnDT is certainly an economic and readily available aid to agricultural\r\nproduction, it must not be overlcoted that once it enters the food chain it is\r\ncapable of causing genetic changes in human beings.\r\nPakistan greatly appreciates the co~tinuing efforts of the IAEA to help\r\nstrengthen the infrastructure for the planning, establishment and safe\r\noperation of nuclear-power projects in the developing countries through\r\nintraregional and international training courses and technical assistance\r\nprojects.\r\nThe Agency\u0027s efforts in promoting nuclear safety world wide are\r\ncommendable. The nuclear-safety colloquium held every year since 1985 during\r\nthe General Conference provides an invaluable opportunity to review ana\r\nexchange ideas on current sdfety issues and future p~ogrammes. Pakistan\r\nrecommends that this event which has proved its usefulness should be continued\r\non a regular basis. Similarly, the Operational Safety Review Team (OSART)\r\nprogramme, which was initiated by the Agency in 1983 to assist member States\r\nin reviewing the operations of their nuclear-power plants, has proved to be of\r\ngreat benefit. Pakistan is also appreciative of the efforts being made by the\r\n~\r\n!\r\nI\r\nl\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n,\r\nI\r\nI\r\n!\r\nr\r\n;\r\n(Mr. Daba, Pakistan)\r\nAgency to extend the Assessment of Safety Significant Events Teams (ASSET)\r\nservices to all mamber Stat.eso !n our view these missions would definitely\r\ncontribute to the improvement of the operationalsatety of nuclear-power\r\nplants.\r\nThe Agency\u0027s recent programme to upgrade the safety of nuclear-power\r\nplants in the former USSR and Eastern Eurcpe is highly noteworthy. We expect\r\nthat the Agency will take suitable initiatives fo~ upgrading safety,\r\nrefurbishing and extending the useful life-span of the other ageing\r\nnuclear-power plants in developing countries as well.\r\nIn recent years, nuclear-reactor accidents have underlined the essential\r\nneed for the proper maintenance and repair of nuclear reactors. Yet in\r\ncertain cases essential spare parts are not being provided for reactors even\r\nwhen they are under Agency safeguards. This situation is totally unjustified\r\nand requires urgent redress. We call upon the supplier States to provide full\r\nmaintenance coverage for the reactors provided by them.\r\nWe commend the Agency\u0027s efforts in convening a meeting of experts with a\r\nview to arriving at an international nuclear-safety convention. There should\r\nindeed be certain minimum binding international standards for nuclear safety.\r\nHowever, nuclear safety is, and should remain, the responsibility of national\r\nregulatory authorities. The Agency\u0027s safety-related services to member States\r\nsuch as the OSART, ASSET, the Waste Management Advisory Programme (WAMAP) and\r\nthe Radioactive Waste Management Safety Standards (RADWASS) missions can be of\r\ntremendous help to national regulators, and member States could be encouraged\r\nto make further use of these missions.\r\nWe would suggest that the Agency, in providing various safety-related\r\nservices to its member States, should make. increased use of the experts\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.4JJ\r\n49-50\r\n(Mr. Daba, Pakistan)\r\navailable from developing countries in order to benefit from their familiarity\r\nwith and knowledge of the facilities in question.\r\nPakistan has actively sought to promota an inter~ational agreement\r\nprohibiting attacks against all nuclear facilities. In this connection, I\r\nwould mention that Pakistan and India have ratified the agreement not to\r\nattack each other\u0027s nuclear facilities. In our view such ag~eements will\r\nenhance nuclear safety.\r\nPakistan has always adhered to and will continue to lend its fullest\r\nsupport to the Agency safeguards. We have tiroe and again reaffirmed, at the\r\nhighest level, our commitmept to nuclear non-proliferation and to the peaceful\r\nuses of nuclear energy. In efforts to keep the world f~ee from the scourge of\r\nnuclear weapons, Pakistan has been calling for the total prohibition of\r\nnuclear testing. Pakistan has, in addition, made several proposals to keep\r\nour region free of nuclear weapons. Pakistan\u0027s proposal for the establishment\r\nof a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia has been repeatedly endorsed by\r\nthe General Assembly since 1974. Last year, the Prime Minister of Pakistan\r\ncalled for consultations among the United States, the Russian Federation,\r\nChina, India and Pakistan to en3ure nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia on\r\nan equitable and non-discriminatory basis.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/4111\u0027V.44\r\n51\r\n(Mr. Deba, Pakistan)\r\nWe are encouraged by the positive response by th6 United States, Russia\r\nand China to the Prime Minister\u0027s proposal. We hope that India will also\r\nrespond positively. This proposal reflects our sincere commitment to the\r\nobjective of nuclear non-proliferation.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to reiterate Pakistan\u0027s full\r\nsupport for the development of nuclear energy and technology for peaceful\r\npurposes. It is our earnest hope that the Agency, in keeping with its charter\r\nand mandate, will assign top priority to this objective. This has become all\r\nthe more important as developing countries are faced with increasing\r\nresistance from some States in their efforts to obtain technology for the\r\ndevelopment and advancement of their peaceful nuclear-energy programmes.\r\nThe General Assembly, in its resolution 32/50, has categorically affirmed\r\nthat\r\n\"All States have the right, in accordance with the principle of\r\nsovereign equality, to develop their programme for the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear technology for economic and social development, in conformity\r\nwith their priorities, interests and needs\". (~l1tion 32/50,\r\npara. 1 (1\u0027»\r\nThe resolution also clearly states that:\r\n\"All States, without discrimination, should have access to and\r\nshould be free to acquire nuclear technology, equipment and materials for\r\nthe peaceful use of nuclear energy\".

Under the circumstances,\r\nit is all the more important that the benefits of nuclear power be made\r\ntechnically and economically accessible to energy-starved developing countries\r\nwithout discrimination.\r\nWe believe that an equitable balance should be maintained between the\r\nfunds allocated by the Agency for technical assistance and those provided for\r\nsafeguards. The regulatory and promotional functions af the IAEA are indeed\r\ncomplementary. We suppo~t the Agency\u0027s proposals for improvements in its\r\nsafeguards applications and procedures. We hope these improvements will be\r\neffected, as far as possible, through streo\u003c:.~.~ing and enhancing efficiency\r\nand not through the divereion of resource~ f~Q~ the equally vital objective of\r\npromoting the penceful uses of nuclear technology. Moreover, as in the case\r\nof nuclear safeguards, the technical assistance activities of the IAEA should\r\nalso be financed through a predictable and assured source of funding.\r\nPakistan is pleased to join in supporting the draft resolution on the\r\nreport of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\r\nMr. KRASULIN (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian):\r\nThe Russian delegation wauld like, first of all, to express its gratitUde to\r\nthe Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the\r\ncomprehensive presentation of the Agency\u0027s report for 1991, which gives us a\r\nfairly full picture of the broad and varied activities carried on by IAEA for\r\nthe benefit of the entire international community.\r\nI\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n- -----_._---------\r\nA/47/PV.44\r\n53\r\n(Mt. \u0027rasulin, Russian Federation)\r\nToday those activities are taking place against the backdrop of radical\r\nchanges in the world. For 21.11 its complezit.y, the emerging DeW situation is\r\nobjectively leading to the enhancement of the role and potential of central\r\nagencies for international cooperation, including such an important\r\ninternational organization as lAEA. Our country will continue to provide lAEA\r\nwith the necessary support in all areas of its activities, thereby\r\nstrengthening the Agency\u0027s authority and influence.\r\nWe find very timely the broad spectrum of lAEA programmes for studying\r\nand resolving such important problems as current and future technology for\r\nnuclear power and its fuel cycle, the handling of radioactive waste,\r\nnon-proliferation o~ nUClear weapons and the physical protection of nuclear\r\nmaterials. We commend the work done by the Agency to ensure nuclear and\r\nradiation safety, and we feel that it is necessary to help raise that safety\r\nto the highest level, both in our own country and throughout the world.\r\nUnquestionably, a key activity of the Agency is convincing the world community\r\nthat the nuclear materials and installations under the control of IAEA are\r\nused ezclusively for peaceful purposes. I would especially like to mention in\r\nthis connection that a great deal of ~ork is being done by lAEA in Iraq in\r\npursuance of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.\r\nUnder new conditions - and this was also confirmed, in particular, during\r\nthe general debate at this dession of the General Assembly - foremost among\r\nmultilateral efforts are the problems of ensuring non-proliferation of all\r\ntypes of wsapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems and\r\nstrenqthening the existing non-prolif~ration regimes. A major effort here is\r\naimed at strengtilening the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and making it a\r\nuniversal agreement of unlimited duration, and we view this as the main goal\r\nof the Conference on the Treaty, to be held in 1995.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.44\r\n54\r\n(Mr. Krasulin, Russiap federatioA)\r\nRussia welcomes the fact that China, France, South Africa and a number of\r\nother countries have acceded to the NPr and that Argentina and Brazil have\r\nassumed appropriate obligations in the area of safeguards.\r\nIt is significant that not only is an active process under way to make\r\nthe Treaty universal, but also some of its particular provisions, such as its\r\nimportant Article VI, which contai~s obligations regarding disarmament\r\nmeasures, are being implemented. A convincing example of such progress and a\r\nradically new step in the area of weapons monitoring was the agreement reached\r\nat Washington by the Presidents of Russia and the United States on further\r\nsubstantial reductions in strategic offensive weapons. That agreement\r\nrepresents a logical extension of the Treaty on the Reducti~n and Limitation\r\nof Strategic Arms and the Lisbon Protocol to it. It has become a practical\r\nreflection in the military spbere of the radically new pattern of relations\r\nbetween Russia and the United States and of a different role for those two\r\nPowers in the world. For the first time, a joint understanding has been built\r\nnot on the basis of arithmetical equality but on the basis of reasonable\r\nsufficiency. This circumstance is of significance as a matter of principle,\r\nand we hope that it will have a positive effect on the position of other\r\nnuclear Powers and on the strengthening of strategic stability and\r\ninternational security ss a whole.\r\nRussia considers it essential that the disintegration of the former\r\nSoviet Union should not lead to any complications of the situation with regard\r\nto non-proliferation.

We also see some value in having the General\r\nAssembly recommend that the Conference on Disarmament should encourage the\r\nefforts of the special committee on safeguards in order to stimulate the\r\nsearch for universally acceptable practical solutions in that sphere. For\r\nexample, more comparable, even if not identical, formulas for so-called\r\nnegative safeguards for non-nuclear countries could be drafted.\r\nIn our view, the United Nations and iAEA are capable of making a\r\nsubstantial contribution to the creation of effective international machinery\r\nfor monitoring thQ production and export of fissionable materials. In\r\nparticular, the General Assembly could support the rapid preparation of an\r\ninternational agreement to end the production of weapons-grade fissionable\r\nmaterials. We advocate the immediate inclusion of problems of this type in\r\nthe negotiations.\r\nThe Russian Federation welcomes the decision of the United States that,\r\nin order to promote nuclear disarmament, it will forgo the production of\r\nplutonium and highly enrichdd uranium. For its part, the Russian Federation\r\nconfirms its intention to continue the programme of shutting down its\r\nremaining facilities for producing weapons-grade plutonium. Our proposal to\r\nthe United States to begin negotiations iim~ediately on the supervised\r\ncessation of the production of fissionable materials for the manufacture of\r\nweapons also remains open.\r\nWith regard to IAEA\u0027s multifaceted activities, we should like to point\r\nout that in the main, the Agency has indeed resolved major problems in such\r\nareas as promoting the development of the peaceful uses of atomic energy and\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n(Mr. Kraluli», Russion Federation)\r\nproviding technical assistance. Accordingly, we tate a favourable view of the\r\nenhancement of activities in respect of the comparative assessment of various\r\nsources of electrical energy from the standpoint of the environment, economy\r\nand safety. We also support the activities of the Agency in connection with\r\nnuclear power generation and its fuel cycle, nuclear safety, the handling of\r\nradioactive waste, the International Nuclear Information System (INIS),\r\ntechnical assistance and other ~reas of interest to all Member States. Of\r\nspecial significance in our view is the great effort that the Agency has made\r\nand is continuing to make for an international assessment of the consequences,\r\nof the Chernobyl disaster. The eradication of those consequences and the safe\r\noperation of nuclear power plants continue to be at the focus of tha Russian\r\nGovernment\u0027s attention.\r\nSupport for IAEA presupposes that financial obligations to the Agency\r\nwill be met. Between September of tbis year and March 1993, Russia, despite\r\nits economic difficulties, will pay \u002712 million in partial settlement of its\r\ndebt to IAEA.\r\nIn conclusion, the delegation of the Russian Federation would like once\r\nagain to express its approval of the IAEA report for 1991, In cOmm8nding the\r\nAgency\u0027s activities, we associate its success with the effective wort of its\r\nsecretariat and its Director General, Mr. Bans Bliz.\r\nSir Michael NESTON (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern\r\nIreland): I should like, on behalf of the European Community and its member\r\nStates, to thank Mr. Bliz and the staff of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) for their work over the past 12 months. The period since the\r\nlast IAEA report to the General Assembly has been one of great activity, and\r\nwe should like to express our appreciation of the role that the Agency has\r\nplayed in it.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\ni\r\nf\r\nI\r\n- -----~----------------..,--_._--\r\nA/471PV.44\r\n59-60\r\n(Sir Michael Weston. United Kingdom)\r\nOf all the Agency\u0027s activities over the past year, none has been more\r\nimportant or more visible than tb~ efforts, made under the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, to uncover and render harmless Iraq\u0027s nuclear-weapons\r\nprogramme, which was pursued covertly over a considerable period in flagrant\r\nbreach of the non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) and safeguards obligations. We\r\nare grateful to the Director General and his staff for the painstaking and\r\ndetermined way in which they have pursued their tasks, notwithstanding\r\npersistent and wilful deception and obstruction from the Iraqi authorities.\r\nWe are confident that they will continue to demonstrate the same dedication.\r\nIn this context the Conwunity and its ~~mber States reiterate the demand\r\ncontained in resolution GC(XXXVI)/RES/579 of the IAEA General Conference,\r\nwhich was adopted on 25 September 1992, that Iraq immediately and fully comply\r\nwith all its obligations under its safeguards agreement with the Agency and\r\nunder relevant Security Council resolutions, including the requirement, under\r\nSecurity Council resolution 707 (1991), that it submit a full~ final and\r\ncomplete declaration of Iraq\u0027s nuclear programme, including all information\r\ncalled for by Security Council resolution 687 (1991). The information that\r\nIraq has provided to date has been seriously lacking, and a number of\r\nimportant lacunae still exi:Jt - most notably on procurement, enrichment and\r\nweaponization. The Community and its member States hope that Iraq is in no\r\ndoub.t about the resolve of the international community to pursue this issue to\r\na satisfactory conclusion.\r\nDuring the year, there have been more welcome highlights, which have\r\nreinforced the non-prolifer3tion regime. China and France have acceded to the\r\nnon-proliferation Treaty. this means that all five permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council are now parties to the Treaty.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n-----------\r\nAl47/PV..44\r\n61\r\n(Sir Machae1 Weston, United Kingdom)\r\nWe also welcome the positive developments towards nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation in Latin America, in particular the steps taken by various\r\ncountries in the region towards brinqing into force the Treaty of T1ate101co\r\nand the signing of a fu11scope safeguards agreement between Argentina, Brazil\r\nand the Aqency~ We are following with interest the implementation of this\r\nagreement as well as the agreement concluded last year between the Agency and\r\nthe South African Government. We are also following with interest the work\r\nbeing conducted by the Director General to identify possible model safeguards\r\nagreements for the Middle East, and we welcome the widespread consensus of\r\nsupport for his eiiorts expressed by last month\u0027s G~neral Conference.\r\nWe welcome, too, the ratification by the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of\r\nKorea of its safeguards agreement with the Agency. We look to the Democratic\r\nPeople\u0027s Republic of Korea fully to implement this agreement as soon as\r\npossible. In this context we also look forward to full implementation of the\r\nbilateral agreement between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People\u0027s\r\nRepublic of Korea on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\r\nThe Community and its member States have long attached the highest\r\npriority to the continuing task of improving and strengthening the whole\r\nsafeguards system. Proposals by the 7Yelve have helped to shape discussion of\r\nhow this can best be done. We welcome in particular the reaffirmation of the\r\nAgency\u0027s right to conduct special inspections. We are also working out the\r\nbest way to meet the Director General\u0027s request to extend the information\r\nreported to the Agency by voluntarily providing additional information on the\r\nproduction of concentrates, on inventories of nuclear materials and on\r\ninternational transfers of sensitive equipment.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.44\r\n62\r\n(Sir Mi~hael Weston, United Kingdom)\r\nWe must emphasize the importance of the Agency\u0027s px;,~ssing on with its\r\nfundamental study of possible alternative safeguards regimes. In the same\r\ncontext we attach great lmportance to the agreement between the Director\r\nGeneral and European Communities Commissioner Cardoso E Cunha on a new\r\npartnership between the Commission and the Agency safeguards departments to\r\navoid unnecessary duplication of effort. We see tne ]I,\u0027 partnership as a\r\nvital opportunity, not only to secure the full implementation of Information\r\nCircular 193 in a way which respects the responsibilities of both sides, but\r\nalso to refocus resources on areas where safeguards can make the greatest\r\ncontribution to non-proliferation.\r\nWe should not lose sight of what has been achieved during the past year\r\nin ~e Agency\u0027s more directly promotional functions - for example, in\r\ndeveloping non-power uses of nuclear energy, where many examples of fine work\r\ncould be quoted. Recognition is also due to the high level of continuing work\r\nin supplying technical assistance.\r\nConcerning nuclear safety generally, the Community and its member States\r\nnote with satisfaction that agreement has been reached on the formulation of\r\nsafety fundamentals. This will be a basic document. The Agency\u0027s review\r\nteams have also expanded the practical enhancement of nuclear safety world\r\nwide. The increased number of requests for Operational Safety Review Team\r\n(OSART) missions and Assessment of Safety Significant Events Team (ASSET)\r\nmissions is the clearest evidence of thei~: value.\r\nLast year the Community and its member States welcomed the start of a\r\nstep-by-step approach towards the establishment of an international nuclear\r\nsafety regime.

We would see such a convention as an important\r\ncontribution to raising the general level of nuclear safety world wide and to\r\ncreating a harmonized international approach to all aspects of nuclear\r\nsafety. We are pleased to note that a group of experts has started work on a\r\nnuclear safety convention, and take the view that their activities should be\r\ncompleted as soon as possible. The Community and its member States are\r\ncommitted to playing a positive part in its negotiation and in the continuing\r\ndiscussions, based on current international nuclear safety experience, of the\r\nmeans of implementing it.\r\nThe Community and its member States also recognize the contribution of\r\nthe Agency in assisting the countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet\r\nUnion in their efforts to improve nuclear safety. We wish to continue our\r\n~lose cooperation with the Agency in the development of its technical\r\nassistance programmes in the area. Similarly, we support the call by the\r\nEconomic Summit in Munich for the international community to contribute to the\r\nfinancing of an urgent programme aimed at improving the safety of nuclear\r\ninstallations in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. We welcome, too,\r\nthe agreement among the Group of 24 that stronger coordination of these\r\nefforts is required and that the resulting machinery will look to the Agency\r\nfor advice.\r\nLast December the European Energy Charter was signed in The Hague. The\r\nCommunity and its member States are grateful for the help which the Agency has\r\nso far given in the negotiation of the nuclear protocol to the Charter. We\r\nlook forward now to quick conclusions to the Charter\u0027s basic agreement and\r\nnuclear protocol on principles governing the peaceful uses of nuclear energy\r\nand the safety of nuclear installations.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAI..lI\".....\r\n6\"-65\r\n(.sh:...Micmael Westop.

Many thriving cities, towns and villages\r\nhave been devastated by thick layers of volcanic dust that settled on a vast\r\narea surrounding Mount Pinatubo. Roads have been cut and infrastructure has\r\nbeen destroyed.\r\nThe eruption resulted in much loss of life and extensive matGrial\r\ndamage. Close to a million people have been displaced. When the monsoop\r\nrains arrived they caused the volcanic dust on the slopes of the mountain to\r\ndescend into the lowlands in the form of huge mud slides. It looks as though\r\nthis condition will recqr for a number of years, turning this cata~trophe into\r\na continuous, unfolding disaster, with painful consequences for the victims\r\nand for the Philippine economy.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.44\r\n66\r\n(Mr. \"sip« brtU)\r\nThe Government, of the Philippines must be commended for the urgent\r\nmeasures it has taken to alleviate the suffering of the victims. However,\r\nqiven the ma~ituda of the calamity, it is clear that the national efforts by\r\nthe Philippines will not suffice. There is a pressing need for international\r\nassistance by Governments as well as other orqanizations.\r\nIt is in response to this need that I have the honour to introduce, on\r\nbehalf of the 61 sponsoring countries, draft resolution Al47/L.8, entitled\r\n\"Emergency Assistance to the Philippines\".\r\nIn addition to the sponsors listed in the document; the £ollowinq\r\ncountries have joined in sponsoring the draft resolution: Afqhanistan,\r\nBrazil, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guatemala, Guinea-Bissau, Honduras,\r\nJamaica, the r..ibyan Arab Jamahiriya, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, the\r\nSudan, Spain, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States of America and\r\nViet Nam.\r\nThis draft resolution is made up of five preamhular aud three operative\r\nparagraphs.\r\nUnder the draft resolution, the Assembly would call upon the\r\nSecretary-General, in cooperation with the relevant organs and organizations\r\nof the United Nations system and in close collaboration with the Government\r\nauthorities, to assist in the rehabilitation efforts of the Government of the\r\nPhilippin~l. It would also request all States and international organizations\r\nto extend, on an u~gent basis, further support to the Philippines in ways that\r\nwould alleviate, for the duration of the emergency and the ensuing\r\nrehabilitation process, the economic and financial burden borne by the\r\nPhilippine people.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n(Mr. AJcdn, Turkey)\r\nTbis draft r ••olutio~ is an ezprosslon of international support and\r\nsolidarity for the victims of the disaster and demonstrates our readiness to\r\n.\r\ncontribute IIOrally and materially tow~rds their rehabilitation.
