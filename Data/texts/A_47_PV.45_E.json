Preventing the prQliferatiQn Qf nuclear\r\nweapQns has becQme more cQmplicated. The demands on International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) safeguards have increased. At the same time, there is a\r\ngrQwinq awareness of the problems in the field of nuclear safety.\r\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency has had to cope with an increasing\r\nwQrkload at a time of diminishinq financial means. My delegation wi~hes to\r\ncongratulate the Director General and his staff on their outstanding work\r\nunder demanding circumstances.\r\nFinland concurs with the view expressed by the DirectQr General that the\r\nAgency\u0027s programme mix as a whole CQuld be looked intQ in the light of recent\r\ndevelopments. Such an exercise CQuld make it pQssible to revise the\r\npriQrities of the Agency accordingly.\r\nThe mQst impQrtant current endeavour in the field Qf nuclear safety is\r\nthe preparation of an international conventiQn. Safe, well-maintained and\r\nwell-managed use Qf nuclear energy will cQntinue tQ cQnstitute Qne Qf the main\r\nsources of energy in Finland. However, nuclear safety is not Qnly a natiQnal\r\nmatter, but alsQ a subject of legitimate internatiQnal concern, irrespective\r\nof bQrders. An early agreement Qn the conventiQn WQuld be a majQr achievement.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n3\r\n(Mr. Karhilo, Fipland)\r\nViews on the conventionts exact content and scope diverge, but the basic\r\ninterests are common. In the Finnish view, its essence would bB a commitment\r\nto internationally agreed safety principles. The primary ~6sponsi~ility for\r\nsafety would rest with national organi~ations. Jointly agreed principles\r\nwould create the necessa~y basis for national safety practices and better\r\nquality control. The convention should also contain provisions for suitable\r\nfollow-up measures, fostering regular contacts and transparency in the\r\nexchange of regulatory findings and operational data. These \u0026re prerequisites\r\nfor a credible and effective control system.\r\nThus far, the work on the convention has addressed civilian nuclea~ PQwar\r\nplants, as this approach appears to offer the best possibilities for rapid\r\nprogress. However, management and disposal of radioactive waste, including\r\nwaste from military use of nuclear energy, creates safety concerns as well.\r\nWhile it is important at this stage to concentrate on civilian plants, the\r\nprinciple of international responsibility for handling of radioactive waste,\r\ninclUding waste fronl military applications, should not be overlooked in the\r\nfuture convention.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that the legitimacy of these concerns has been\r\nacknowledged, for example, in the nuclear safety working group of the Council\r\nof the Baltic Sea States, an intergovernmental grouping that brings together\r\nFinland, all the other littoral States of the Baltic Sea and the Commission of\r\nthe European Communities.\r\nWhile it is vital to agree on a safety convention at an early date, there\r\nare even more urgent tasks ahead. The safety of old reactors in Eastern and\r\nCentral Europe is cf great concern. Every effort should be made to improve\r\nthe safety of risk-prone reactors pending their shut-down.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n4-5\r\n(Hr. Karhilo, Finland)\r\nFinnish o~qanizations are already engaged in this work, bilaterally as\r\nwell 08 multilaterally. Finland is particularly concerned about some of the\r\nreactors in our immediate neighbourhood in the St. Petorsburg area and in the\r\nKola Peninsula.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/471PV.45\r\n6\r\n(Mr. Karhilo, Finland)\r\nAccording to an agreement between the relevant Finnish and Russian\r\nauthorities, Finnish experts will assist in drawing up a plan of improvement\r\nof the nuclear safety of Russian reactors in areas adjacent to Finland. More\r\nthan a million dollars have already been invested by Finland in this\r\ncooperation. As part of this cooperation, the Finnish Centre for Radiation\r\nSafety will equip the Sosnovyi Bor and Kola Peninsula nuclear power plants\r\nwith INMARSAT-C telecommunications stations. More rapid and comprehensive\r\nexchange of information in the event of an emergency is in everyone\u0027s interest.\r\nProgress in arms control and disarmament, including the Lisbon Protocol\r\non the multilateral implementation of the START Treaty and the subsequent\r\nunilateral nuclea~ disarmament commitments by the United States and Russia,\r\nenhances the prospects for an indefinite extension of the non-proliferation\r\nTreaty. We also welcome the cooperation batween Russia and the United States\r\non commercial utilization of highly enriched Russian uranium in electricity\r\nproduction as such uranium becomes redundant through the process of\r\ndismantling nuclear warheads.\r\nHalting the spread of nuclear weapons is the main task for the parties to\r\nthe non-proliferation Treaty and a common endeavour of the member States of\r\nthe International· Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Finland\u0027s goal for the 1995\r\nnon-proliferation Treaty Conference is the indefinite extension of the life of\r\nthe Treaty.\r\nAs a strong supporter of the non-proliferation Treaty, Finland welcomes\r\nthe formal accession of China and France to the Treaty. We continue to urge\r\nall countries not yet parties to accede to the Treaty so as to make it\r\nuniversal by the time of its extension in 1995. We welcome the new safeguards\r\nagreements, notably with South Africa, Argentina/Brazil, the Democratic\r\nPeople\u0027s Republic of Korea and Syria.\r\n~---~~-- ----\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n(Mr, Karhilo, Finland)\r\nOf special concern are the member States of the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States. We note with satisfaction the recent accession of\r\nUzbakistan and Azerbaijan to the non-proliferation Treaty as\r\nnon-nuclBar-weapon Stateso The commitments already undertaken in this respect\r\nby Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan lead us to ezpect that their accession will\r\nnot be long in coming. We have noted with satisfaction the recent statements\r\nin the First Committee by Belarus and Ukraine reaffirming their intention to\r\naccede to the non-proliferation Treaty in the very near future.\r\nWe note with concern that some 40 countries have yet to conclude\r\nsafeguards agreements. These agreements are not a formality. They are\r\nrequired by the non-proliferation Treaty regardless of whether a State Party\r\nconducts any peaceful activities or not. We continue to urge the countries\r\nconcerned to proceed to conclude the requisite agreements with the Agency as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\nTurning to the implementation of Security Council resolutions 687 (1991),\r\n707 (1991) and 715 (1991), the Director General and his staff should be\r\ncommanded for the excellent work they have done, often under extremely\r\ndifficult conditions. We are confideut that the remaining essential tasks\r\nwill be performed in the same competent manner and in good cooperation with\r\nthe United Nations Special Commission.\r\nThe Iraqi case brought to light serious shortcomings in the present\r\nsafeguards system. It is disconcerting to note that, while the IAEA performed\r\nits duties fully in accordance with existing rules and practices, it was none\r\nthe less possible for Iraq ;0 engage in large-scale acti~iti9s aimed at\r\ndeveloping nuclear weapons. Moreover there was no certainty of discovery had\r\nthe inspections continued on the same basis.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA147/PV.45\r\n8\r\n(Mr. Karhi10, Finland)\r\nWe note with satisfaction that work to strengthen the safeguards system\r\nhas begun. In our view the IAEA must be ~le to make full use of the mandate\r\ngiven to it in the Statute and in the various safeguards agreements if\r\ncircumstances so require.\r\nAn important step towards st~engthening the non-proliferation regime is\r\nthe declaration by 27 cuuntries, including Finland, to follow the commonly\r\nagreed Guidelines for Transfers of Nuclear-Related Dual-Use Equipment,\r\nMaterial and Related Technology in their nuclear exports. These countries\r\nhave also decided henceforth to apply the so-called fu1l-scope-safeguards\r\nprinciple as a condition for their nuclear supplies, a principle which Finland\r\nand a number of other countries have been advocating for a long time.\r\nFinland has recently become a member of the IAEA Board of Governors. The\r\nthemes discussed in th~.s statement will be our main preoccupations during our\r\ntenure on the Board. The Agency must continue to strengthen the safeguards\r\nsystem, give impetus to improved nuclear safety and streamline its\r\norganization so as to maintain its relevance and cost-effectiveness also in\r\nthe future. We trust that the Agency will be able to meet these new\r\nchallenges of a new era.\r\nMr. WLOSOWICZ (Poland): Both the report of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) for the year 1991 and the substantive statement of\r\nMr. Hans Blix, which provides information on the Agency\u0027s activities during\r\n1992, give me a welcome opportunity to commend the positive role played by the\r\nIAEA in enhancing further international cooperation in the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy and to emphasize its contribution to the strengthening of the\r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n9\r\n(Mr. Wlosowicz, Poland)\r\nPoland welcomes the recent accessions to the non-proliferation Treaty of\r\nChina, France and the Republic of South Africa as well as undertakings made by\r\nBelarus, Kazakhstan and the Ukraine to accede to the Treaty in the near future\r\nas non-nuclear States. It is also gratifying that the major countries of\r\nLatin America are now taking the final steps in the process of bringing into\r\nforce the Treaty of Tlatelolco. North Korea\u0027s fulfilment of its obligation to\r\nconclude a safeguards agreement with the IAEA represents an important first\r\nstep in the right direction. Also, the cooperation of the North Korean\r\nauthorities with the inspection teams so far is to be welcomed.\r\nIn the Middle East we are still witnessing the dismantling, under\r\nUnited Nations auspices, of clandestine preparations to develop a\r\nnuclear-weapons capability. In this context we would like to note with\r\nappreciation the determined actions of the Agency concerned with Iraq\u0027s\r\nnon-compliance with its nuclear-non-proliferation obligations. We commend the\r\nIAEA in particular for its efforts in the implementation of the pertinent\r\nSecurity Council resolutions. We support, in particular, the requirement that\r\nIraq should submit to the Agency a full and complete declaration of its\r\nnuclear programme.\r\nPoland accords top priority to the strengthening of the international\r\nsafeguards system, which underpins the whole non-proliferation regime. We\r\ntherefore welcome the confirmation by the member States of the IAEA at last\r\nmonth\u0027s General Conference of their determination to continue efforts to\r\nstrengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the system. The decisions of\r\nthe Agency\u0027s Board of Governors that the members of the IAEA shall give\r\ninformation as to their respective transfers of nuclear materials and\r\nequipment are an important input to the safeguards system.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.45\r\n10\r\n(Mr. Wlosowicz, Poland)\r\nHere I should like also to mention in this context the commendable\r\nactivities of the Zangger Committee and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, which are\r\nconcentrating on the guidelines for nuclear transfers.\r\nWe believe that the favourable changes in the international environment\r\nshould be properly reflected in decisions of the non-proliferation Treaty\r\nBeview Conference in 1995. They should consolidate and further reinforce the\r\nimportance of the Treaty and in particular extend its validity indefinitely.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAJ47/PV.4S\r\n11\r\n(Mr. Wlosowicz, Poland)\r\nNuclear safety remains one of our greatest concerns. Poland supports all\r\ninternational efforts aimed at upgrading the safe~y standards of old nuclear\r\ninstallations still in oper~tion in Eastern and Central Europe. We welcome\r\n!\r\nthe assistance offered in this regard by the countries possessing advanced\r\nnuclear technologies and hope that their application will minimize risk to\r\nlife, health, and environment. We join others in urging that work on a\r\nnuclear safety convention be continued and accelerated.\r\nPoland is deeply co~~ittted to cooperation with the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency. Not only do we highly appreciate and share the Agency\u0027s lofty\r\ngoals, such as preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, but we also\r\nwork together and benefit from that cooperation in many practical fields, such\r\nas food prsservu~~~n, medicine, and the protection of the environment.\r\nApplying nuclear anergy to reducing the emissions of carbon dioxide and\r\nnitrogen oxide into the atmosphere and electron-beam flue-gases purification\r\nhas been the Agency\u0027s latest contribution to our programme of environmental\r\nprotection.\r\nThe activities of the International Atomic Energy AcJency, whiCh so fully\r\nI\r\nfound their reflection in the report and statement of its Director General,\r\ndeserve our full appreciation. It is also for this reason that we support tho\r\ndraft resolution on the report of the lAEA.\r\nMr. DEYANOV (Bulgaria): I should like to associate the delegation\r\nof Bulgaria with the other delegations that have expressed their appreciation\r\nto the Director General of the International Atomic 2nergy Agency (IAEA),\r\nMr. Hans Blix, for his det,!.led and comprehensive statement and rgr the annual\r\nreport he introduced on th! operations of the Agency in 1991.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.45\r\n12\r\n(Mr. DeYanoy, Bulgaria)\r\nAs one of the founding members, Bulgaria has long been an active\r\nsupporter of the Agency, which remains an organization of critical importance\r\nto the international community. In the new situation in the world, the lAEA\r\ncontinues to play a vital role in fostering global peace and security and in\r\npromoting cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The Director\r\nGeneral and his staff deserve to be commended for their tireless efforts and\r\npersonal devotion to the task of adapting the Agency to the fundamental\r\nchanges and of responding adequately to the new challenges of our time.\r\nThe delegation of Bulgaria considers the annual report of the IAEA to be\r\na successful attempt to present a comprehensive and well-balanced analysis of\r\nthe Agency\u0027s activities in i991. The report clearly demonstrates that the\r\nAgency has continued to fulfil its responsibilities, as provided for in its\r\nstatute and in the resolutions of the General Conference and the Board of\r\nGovernors.\r\nAs a Vice-Chairman of the Board of Governors, Bulgaria participated in\r\nthe process of detailed consideration and adoption of decisions related to\r\nlAP-A activities during a period covered by its report. My delegation endorses\r\nthis report, as it faithfu~ly reflects the Agency\u0027s efforts to strengthen its\r\ni\r\nsafeguards system, improve the scope and the effectiveness of its nuclear\r\nsafety and nuclear cooperation programmes and serve as a major source of\r\ntechttical assistance to member States. Accordingly, I wish to express the\r\nstrong support of my delegation for draft resolution A/47/L.9/Rev.1 on the\r\nI\r\nAgency\u0027s 1991 annual report, introduced by Australia yesterday on behalf of a\r\nnumber of sponsors, including Bulgaria.\r\nBulgaria attaches par;icu1ar importance to the programmes Of the Agency\r\non developing standards an! providing assistance in ensuring nuclear and\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.45\r\n13\r\n(Mr. Deyanoy, Bulgaria)\r\nradioactive safety. This is in line ~ith the commitment of the Statas\r\nparticipatinq in the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in\r\nEurope, as set forth in the 1992 Helsinki decisions, to work to support the\r\ntechnical cooperation proqrammes ot the lAEA aimed at enhancinq nuclear\r\nsafety. We consider the technical assistance regularly provided by the Aqency\r\nto be instrumental in helpinq developinq countries, as well as countries in\r\ntransition, to acquire the necessary expertise and support fOl\u0027 their national\r\nproqrammes.\r\nHavinq said this, I cannot but share the concern expressed in the\r\nAqency\u0027s report about the decline in the number of pledqes towards the\r\nTechnical Assistance and Cooperation Fund tarqet. Notwithstandinq the\r\nincrease in the total value of resources, the percentaqe of the tarqet met\r\nthrouqh pledqes declined from 85.3 per cent in 1990 to 78.4 per cent in 1991.\r\nMy de1eqation is afraid tha~ this may cause considerable difficulties for the\r\nAqency in carryinq out its programmes to render technical assistance to\r\ncountries in need. Despite its financial difficulties, Bulqaria has never\r\nstopped makinq its contribution to the Technical Assistance and Cooperation\r\nFund of the Agency and expects that all otiler Member States will increase\r\ntheir support for this Fund.\r\nBulqaria is amonq the countries th~t heavily rely on the use of nuclear\r\nenarqy to meet most of their enerqy needs. Over 40 per cent of Bulqaria\u0027s\r\npower-generatinq capacity .s being provided by the Kozloduy nuclear reactors.\r\nThe regular supply of the ~ount~y with such enerqy, and effective parallel\r\nI\r\nactions to improve nuclear s\"fety standards, are major objectives of my\r\nGovernment in advancing the country on the difficult road from a centrally\r\nplanned to a free-market economy.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n14\r\n(Mr. DeYanQY, BUlgaria)\r\nD~mocratic changes in ~astern and Central Europe have given rise ~o an\r\n.\r\ni~creased public interest in and insistence on so~ving problems of\r\nnuclear-power-plant safety and of finding ways and means to ensure more\r\nefficient use of energy in these countries.\r\nBulgaria is not an ex·:eption in this respect. Both the Parliament and a\r\nnl~ber of environmental protection groups in my country are actively engaged\r\nin joint actions with the r,overnment to promote higher standa~ds of nuclear\r\nsafety and to ensure a better performance of all the six reactor units at the\r\nKozloduy nuclear power plant. The Government of BUlgaria remains committ~d to\r\nmakinq further progress tow~rds this end, irrespective of the financial and\r\nf\r\nlogistic difficulties encountered in view of the serious economic challenges\r\nthat the country faces at present. It may seem natural, therefore, that to\r\naccomplish this goal my Government relies to a certain extent on external\r\nassistance both from other countries and from international organizations.\r\nBulgaria highly appreciates the work of the IAEA in implementing its\r\nspecial project set up to examine the older type of Soviet-designed reactors -\r\nthe WWER 440 Model 230 - w~ich obviously need some improvements related to\r\nnuclear safety. As reflec\u0027:gd in the annual report, in 1991 the Agency\r\nconducted under this project a review of the design concept of this type of\r\nI\r\nnuclear power plant. This review pointed to differences existing between\r\nI\r\nvarious nuclear plants of this type, which helped to confirm the importance of\r\ncarrying out plant-specifi.~ review missions in a number of Eastern European\r\ncountries concerned.\r\nOperational safety ret,iew team missions have also been conducted under\r\nthis project in Bulgaria a; the Kozloduy nuclear power plant, particularly at\r\nits four WWER-440/230 unit.i. Although none of the Kozloduy reactors is of the\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.45\r\n15\r\n(Mr. Deyanoy, Bulgaria)\r\nChernobyl type, these four units require further improvement if they are to\r\nmeet the hiqher nuclear standards applied in Europe. The other two units at\r\nthis plant are of a diffe~ent type - WHER-IOOO - which is not only a more\r\npowerful nuclear reactor but also much safer, and more reliable. Additional\r\nlAEA missions have ~eviewed the safety of our nuclea~ power plant aqainst\r\nseismic hazards, emphasizi~q earthquake desiqn acceleration and the seismic\r\nvulnerability of structure., and components important to safety.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n16\r\n(Mr. DQyanoy. Bulgaria)\r\nIn the light of the results of the IAEA,missions, the Bulgarian\r\nGovernment has takan ~pecific measures and is now making serious efforts to\r\nimplement the recommenaations of the Agency experts. We are determined to do\r\nour best to improve the nuclear safety of the Kozloduy power plant,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that due to the scarcity of financial resources this\r\ncourse of ~ction may cause some difficulties for the economy, as well as some\r\nsocial tension because of cuts in other Government-sponsored programmes.\r\nThe steps taken by my Government have involved, inter alia, a number of\r\nradical actions, such as a provision~! shutdown of most of the reactor units\r\nat the Kosloduy nuclear power plant to make the recommended safety\r\nimprovements. Bulgaria has received assistance for this purpose from the\r\nWorld Association of Nuclear Operators and various national nuclear\r\nauthorities and societies that have developed specific projects to achieve a\r\ndrastic improvement in the operation of the reactors. ~he European Community\r\nand the World Bank have also rendered extremely valuable financial support.\r\nOn behalf of my Government I should like to express the deep gratitude of\r\nBulgaria to the Governments and international organizations that have assisted\r\nmy country in this respect. We hope that this kind of cooperation will\r\ncontinue in the future. Our objective is to ensure the safety of all nuclear\r\ninstallations in Bulgaria, in order to protect the population and the\r\nenviromnent in conformity with the relevant commitments as formulated in the\r\n1992 Helsinki decisions.\r\nWe believe that with the detailed implementation of the European Energy\r\nCharter the long-term ener~ situation in Central and Eastern Europe could be\r\nsignificantly changed for the better.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n17\r\n(Mr. DeYanQv, Bulgaria)\r\nThe work to develop a nuclear safety convention c.urrently under way in\r\nthe UBA is of great importance for improving the safety of nuclear power\r\nplants while taking fully into account the specific needs of the countries\r\nconcerned. The results of the Conference on the Safety of Nuclear Power,\r\nwhich reviewed safety issues at technical and policy-making level! and\r\nformulated valuable recommendations for future acti.ons, provide fUl\u0027ther useful\r\nguidance in this area.\r\nI should like to mention with appreciation the fact that bilateral\r\nassistance from the Group of 7 and the Group of 24 States and the support\r\nprogrammes initiated by the Commission of the European Communities, the IAEA\r\nand the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development are already\r\nunder way. The programmes have so far focused on analysis, consulting and\r\ntraining, but we hope that greater involvement in solving nuclear safety\r\ndeficiency problems will be forthcoming, in terms both of providing the\r\nnecessary equipment and of ensuring substantial financial support.\r\nWe understand that, because of the scope and complexity of the issue, a\r\nmultilateral programme of action may also be needed to enhance the ongoing\r\nbilateral assistance. I wish to make special note of the important role\r\nalready being played in this respect by the European Commission, which is\r\nresponsible for coordinating the Group of 24 technical assistance on nuclear\r\nsafety - carried out with advice from the IAEA - to Central and Eastern\r\nEuropean States.\r\nMy delegation shares the view that progress in improving the nuclear\r\nsafety of the reactors operating in Central and Eastern Europe can best ge\r\nensured in an environment of successful economic reforms, including the\r\nadoption of free market principles, freer trade and the creation of favourable\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.45\r\n18\r\n(Mr. Deyanov, Bulgaria)\r\nconditions for investment. BUlgaria is committed to such a trunsformation and\r\nhas already taken a number of important steps in pursuing this process.\r\nThe recent progress in the field of nuclear disarmament and the increased\r\nreliance of the United Nations on preventive diplomacy have highlighted\r\nwidespread concerns abou~ the danger from the proliferation of nuclear weapons\r\nand their delivery systems. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) remains the most important building block in the international\r\nregime designed to cope with this danger.\r\nIn the new international environment, the Security Council could become\r\nan effective forum for non-proliferation enforcement. As its primary\r\nresponsibility relates to the maintenance of international peace and security,\r\nthe Security Council is entitled to adopt, and should adopt, measures whose\r\nbasic objective is to curb proliferation and impose sanctions on States which\r\nviolate international agreements.\r\nThe international comn,unity now needs effective action to safeguard\r\nnuclear material, to detect in time, and pravent, transfers of nuclear weapons\r\nor their clandestine production. The fundamental role of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency in this respect is well recognized and should be further\r\nenhanced.\r\nMy delegation believes that nuclear cooperation should be conditional on\r\nadherence to and strict compliance with the non-proliferation Treaty or other\r\nequally binding bilateral or multilateral agreements. My country accepts such\r\na requirement as the basis for its own participation in this cooperation.\r\nAs a member of the Eu~lear Suppliers Group, BUlgaria is participating in\r\nthe current process of enhancing its export control guidelines and other\r\nrelevant instruments. The Bulgarian Government has adopted a decision to\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n19\r\n(Mr. Deyanoy, Bulgaria)\r\nimplement fully the new international arranqements agreed upon by the Nuclear\r\nSuppliers Group in Warsaw this year, which are now a key element in Bulgaria\u0027s\r\nexport control policy. Full-scope safequards as a condition for nuclear\r\nsupply are an integral part of the common export policy of all Nuclear\r\nSuppliers Group member States. We hope that other States will soon follow\r\nsuit.\r\nBUlgaria believes that the IAEA\u0027s ability to fulfil its statutory\r\nfunctions has to be further enhanced. The Agency must receive all the\r\nnecessary resources to strengthen its safequards regime, conduct special\r\ninspections and refer unresolved cases of proliferation to the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn his statement to the Assembly yesterday, Mr. Hans Blix pointed out\r\n~\r\nthat the Board of Governors of the IAEA had confirmed the Agency\u0027s right to\r\nperform special inspections when there were reasons to believe that\r\ninstallations or material that should have been declared had not been so\r\ndeclared. We concur with the Director General that, in the new safequards\r\nsystem now taking shape in the Agency, the information provided by the\r\ninspected State must be supplemented by additional data from other States.\r\nIn this context, we consider that actions by the lAEA\u0027s principal organs\r\nto implement the concept of universal reporting with respect to exports and\r\nimports of nuclear material, inventories, relevant nuclear-related equipment\r\nand other non-nuclear material deserve every encouragement and further\r\ndevelopment.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n20\r\n(Mr. Deyanoy, Bulgaria)\r\nBulgaria welcomes the recent decisions taken by the Agency to strengthen\r\nits safeguards system. My delegation is glad to note also that an appropriate\r\nreference to these decisions is contained in draft resolution Al47/L.9/Rev.l,\r\non the Agency\u0027s report.\r\nThe results of the inspections carried out by the United Nations Special\r\nCommission and the IAEA, which have proved Iraq\u0027s non-compliance with its\r\nsafeguards obligations und6r the non-proliferation Treatyg will serve as a\r\ntimely warning of the grave consequences that potential proliferators will\r\nhave to face in the future. This is a central point with respect to the\r\nequally important chemical, biological and missile-technology areas also.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n21\r\n(Mr. DeYanov, BUlgaria)\r\nBu19a~ia supported the resolution adopted by the thirty-sixtb General\r\nConference of the Agency dealing with Iraq\u0027s non-compliance with its\r\nsafeguards obligations. Some formulations in these resolutioDs have found a\r\nplace in draft resolution L.9/Rev.1, submitted to the General Assembly. In\r\nthis respect, I wish to mention our appreciation of the strenuous efforts of\r\nthe Director General and h~s staff in the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolutions 687 (1991), 707 (1991) and 715 (1991), in particular the. detection\r\nand destruction or otherwise rendering harmless of equipment and material that\r\ncould be used for nuclear weapons.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like once again to confirm Bulgaria\u0027s strong\r\nsupport for the International Atomic Energy Aqency. It is our firm belief\r\nthat the Agency\u0027s cont~ibu~ion to ensuring the uses of nucloar energy for\r\npeaceful purposes and to securing a stable operation of the nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation regime should receive well-deserved acclaim from the entire\r\nI\r\ninternational community.\r\nGuided by those considerations, my delegation will vote in favour of\r\ndraft resolution Al47/L.9/Rev.l, concerning the 1991 annual report of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\r\nMr. BURAVKIN (Belarus) (interpretation from Russian): It has been\r\nsaid many times from this rostrum that 1992 is a landmark year in many\r\nrespects. There is hope t\u0027lat in world history it will be repeatedly referred\r\nto as a year of enormously important political changes that gave mankind\r\nunprecedented opportunitie~ for peaceful development, mutual understanding and\r\nconstructive cooperation.\r\nFor the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), an additional fact\r\nthat makes the year 1992 e~pecially important is that a half-century ago there\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n--------_._---\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n22\r\n(Mt. Buraykin, Belarus)\"\r\noccurred an event which led to the establishment of that organization~ the\r\nfirst controlled nuclear reaction. That achievement determined in large\r\nmeasure the subsequent fate of mankind and provided it with enormous\r\nopportunitias bu~ at the same time, confronted it with a most difficult\r\nchallenge which could, if not met, turn the powerful potential of the atom\r\ninto a tremendous evil and a threat to life on Earth.\r\nThere is nothing surprising in that, because any scientific achievement\r\nis a blessing only when it is dedicated to benefiting mankind and promoting\r\nhuman well-being. Helpin~:to utilize atomic energy for the good of mankind is\r\nthe lofty mission entrusted to lAEA, and we should like to emphasize this\r\ntoday. The extent to which this noble and very responsible mission is carried\r\nout is, to our mind, the criterio:l by which we can appraise the work of the\r\nAgency.\r\nIn paying tribute to the activities of the Agency, we in Belarus -\r\nhaving by a quirk of fate become hostage to the horrible Chernobyl experiment,\r\nwhich in the final analysis resulted from criminal neglect of human life, the\r\nhighest value on Earth - would like to focus our attention on lAEA\u0027s efforts\r\nin the field of radiological protection.\r\nIn this connection, we express our full support for the Agency\u0027s\r\nactivities aimed at completing the review of the basic safety standards for\r\nradiological protection. The drafting and adoption of a new version of those\r\nstandards is extremely impJrtant for the Republic of Belarus, especially in\r\nthe light of the current c~rrections being made in our state programme to\r\ni\r\nminimize the consequences of Chernobyl.\r\nWe are grateful to thJ Agency and to other international organizations\r\nand individual States for ~he implementation of projects in radiolog~cal\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n23\r\n(Mr. \"Buravkin, Belarus)\r\nprotection that directly affect the interests of the population of Belarus.\r\nAs reqards the international Chernobyl project, representatives of Belarus\r\nhave repeatedly spoken of the contradictory nature of the conclusions \"\r\nconcerninq the results of that project. I should like to emphasize that our\r\nview has not chanqed with the passinq of time; on the contrary, we are\r\nbecominq more and more convinced that it is correct. We must note with\r\nconcern and sadness even today that statistical data, includinq those from\r\nsuch an authoritative source as the World Health Orqanization (WHO), all show\r\nan outbreak of oncoloqical disease durinq the post-Chernobyl period in the\r\nstricken territories, especially amonq children. It is enouqh to cite just\r\none fact: oncoloqical disease of the thyroid qland amonq children is 22 times\r\nas prevalent as it was five years ago.\r\nThe Chernobyl tragedy has shown the entire world that a country which has\r\nno atomic power plants of its own does not thereby remain safe from potential\r\nand actual danger if other States have atomic power stations near its\r\nborders. Therefore we are especially interested in expandinq the Agency\u0027s\r\nprogramme for safety at all types of nuclear installations, especially nuclear\r\npower stations. In our view, there is good reason to regard questions of\r\nnuclear safety as priority questions, all the more so because incidents at\r\nnuclear power stations unfortunately continue to take place. The latest one\r\ntook place last week at the Iqnalina power station, which is very close to\r\nBelarus. In 1991, as we can see from the report of the Director General, the\r\nAgency\u0027s information system received 139 reports on various incidents that\r\ntook place at nuclear installations. The statistics are rather alarming.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus unequivocally advocates the establishment of a\r\nbinding regime for nuclear safety. We support the current efforts under the\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nW47lPV.45\r\n24.-25\r\n(Mr. Buraykin, Belarus)\r\nauspices of the Age~cy to ~raft an international convention on the subject.\r\nThe conclusion of a convention would give us a unique opportunity to establish\r\nan officially agreed international approach to all aspects of this problem.\r\nA logical extension of the efforts designed to strengthen the\r\ninternational nuclear-safety regime might be a verifiable international treaty\r\non ending the production of fissionable materials intended for military\r\npurposes. Its conclusion l\u0027ould lead to t!1e establishment of a system for\r\nadditional verification of warheads and nuclear materials.\r\nWe share the concern of the international community over the problems of\r\nmonitoring nuclear weapons, .including weapon.s in the countries of the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent· States (CIS), and we are taking steps to see to it\r\nthat there will be no such concern with regard to our country. We have\r\nwithdrawn all tactical weapons from ·the territory of Belarus, and we have\r\nundertaken to withdraw strategic weapons as well.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.~5\r\n26\r\n(Mr. Buraykin, Belarus}\r\nIn our Republic there has been set up and 13 now operating a competent\r\nnational body, the State Industrial Atomi~ Monitoring Agency~ to prevent the\r\nspread of nuclear materials.

We support the idea\r\nof periodically renewing plans for scientific and technical cooperation on the\r\nbasis of consultations among the menmer States and the secretariat of IAEA.\r\nWe e~phasize that attention should be givon to the advisability of assiqning a\r\nspecial priority to projects concerned with the consequences of the Chernobyl\r\ndisaster.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus recently celebrated the first anniversary of its\r\nsovereignty. The first phase of our independent development is occurring\r\nagainst the background of a severe economic crisis. The people of Belarus\r\nhave been confronted with tasks of unprecedented difficulty that were greatly\r\naggravated by the Chernobyl tragedy. Our Government is making intensive\r\nefforts to improve the lives of people in the affected areas. Enormous\r\nmaterial and technical resources have been devoted to the construction of\r\nhousing in the so-called clean areas for those forced to evacuate the dan~er\r\nzone. We have set standards more rigorous than those in other countries for\r\nthe radionuclide content of foodstuffs. The organization of health care and\r\nof agricultural production methods in the contaminated regions is being\r\nimproved.

The\r\nAgency has contributed significantly to this. We have especially appreciated\r\nthe accession of France and China to the Treaty on the Nott-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), which means that all five permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council have become parties to that Treaty. We have also appreciated\r\nthe accession by the Baltic States and the declaration by the Governments of\r\nUkraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan in which they expressed their determination to\r\naccede to the Treaty as nuclear-free States. It is in the vital interest of\r\nall States of our planet and their inhabitants that the NPT become universal.\r\nWe appeal to all the countries that have not yet ac~eded to the Treaty to do\r\nso as soon as possible, and not later than 1995. The Government of the Czech\r\nand Slovak Federal Republic is of the opinion that the period of validity of\r\nthe Treaty should be extended without any conditions and be unlimited after\r\n1995. We expect that all States parties to the Treaty will fulfil their\r\nI\r\nobligations and that those of them that have not concluded safeguards\r\nagreements with the IAEA will do so without delay.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n---- - ---------\r\nA/47/PV.45\r\n28\r\n(~r. Nejedly, Czechoslovakia~\r\nThe Czech and Slovak FederQl Republic has noted with satisfaction the.\r\ncooperation of South Africa with the IAEA in the implementation of the\r\nsafeguards ~greement and expectfl full implementation by the Democratic\r\nPeople\u0027~ Republic of Korea. We also appreciate the fact that a safeguards\r\nagreement has been concluded by Syria and that one is being implemented by\r\nAlgeria.\r\nWe are determined fully to e~~ance measures to improve the control of\r\nnuclear exports, including the export of dual-use items. We support the\r\nproposals of the lAEA secretariat for universal reporting of transfers of\r\nnuclear material and equipment. We highly appreciate the efforts of the IAEA\r\nDirector General and inspection teams in Iraq, which are aimed ~t implementing\r\nthe relevant resolutions of the Security Council.\r\nThe Czech and Slovak Federal Republic fully approves the decisions of\r\nIAEA bodies on the need to improve the efficiency of the safeguards system\r\nand, at the same time, to increase the efficient use of resources provided ~y\r\nmember States. We appreciate the work done by the IAEA s~cretariat and bodies\r\nin this respect. The efforts to improve the efficiency of safeguards have to\r\nbe increased and, within that framework, made more consistent in their use of\r\nthe potential of the Standing Advisory Group on Safeguards Implementation and\r\nthe proposals submitted by member States in the Agency\u0027s respective bodies.\r\nIn this connection the Czechoslovak delegation wishes to recall the\r\nproposal for the implementation of the so-called alternate safeguards system,\r\nwhich was worked out in coo?eration with the Republic of Austria and submitted\r\nby a Czechoslovak represent~tive at the session of the Committee of the Whole\r\nof this year\u0027s IAEA General Conference. In the opinion of Czechoslovak\r\nexperts, its implementation might lead both to increasing the efficiency and\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n------------\r\nAl47/PV.4S\r\n29-30\r\n(Mr. Hejedly. Czechoslovakia)\r\nto decreasing the costs of the safeguards system. This proposal envisages the\r\nimplementation of new safeguardu ~laments for nuclear activities in compliance\r\nwith new requirements\u0027 \u0027l\u00276r the lAB1\\. safeguards system. The costs would to a\r\nlarge extent be covered by the savings realized through the rationalization of\r\nthe existing, highly complicated safeguards system. We are of the opinion\r\nthat at this time, when we feel the need to strengthen the system and are, at\r\nthe same time, aware of the insufficiency of available resources, this\r\nproposal deserves due att~ntion by the res~ective IABA programmes as well as\r\nof its secretariat.\r\nAnother main area of IABA activities, nuclear energy and its safety,\r\nremains the focus of our attention and interest. The Czech and Slovak Federal\r\nRepublic, as a State with a comparatively extensive nuclear programme\r\nheretofore based on the Soviet-made reactors of the VVER type, is highly\r\nappreciative of the attention paid by the Agency to improving their\r\ntechnological lovel and nuclear safety. Expert missions that have been\r\ncarried out, as well as those being considered, and other activities within\r\nthe programmes adopted by the IABA are appreciated as invaluable support for\r\nour national economy. We see this not only from a purely technical point of\r\nview, but also from the poi~t of view of the credibility of nuclear energy and\r\nits acceptability to the general public.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.45\r\n31\r\n(Mr. Nejedly, Czechoslovakia)\r\nCzechoslovakia is acting in the spirit of the conclusions reached by\r\nleading experts at meetings in recent years, such as the Conference on the\r\ngreenhouse effect held at Toronto in 1988, the fourteenth Congress of the\r\nWorld Energy Conference, held at Montreal in 1989, and the symposium held in\r\nHelsinki in 1991 on electricity and the environment. Our country is convinced\r\nthat technologically advanced and safe nuclear energy - that is, using nuclear\r\nreactors of today\u0027s most advanced technical level, whose fuel-cycle problems\r\nhave been resolved both conceptually and technologically, including the\r\nproblems of processing and disposing of burnt-out nuclear fuel and radioactive\r\nwaste - represents an ecological contribution. Tangible evidence of this is\r\nseen in the state of the environment in the neighbourhood of Czechoslovak\r\nnuclear power plants in Jaslovske Bohunice and Kukovany on the one hand and in\r\nthe North Bohemian border area, with its open-pit lignite mines and its\r\nthermal power plants, on the other.\r\nIn spite of the highest priority the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic\r\nattaches to both those activities of the IAEA, we consider the problem of\r\ntechnical assistance and cooperation to be a highly important issue. We are\r\naware that the insufficien_ attention being paid to the burning problems of\r\nthe less developed countries is a source of tension and suspicion in\r\nNorth-South relations. Through its membership of the IAEA, and within its\r\npossibilities, our country has been providing voluntary assistance through\r\nprog~ammes of technical assistance and cooperation.\r\nAllow me in conclusion to express our satisfaction with the report on the\r\nactivities of the IAEA for the reporting period, and to convey our\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n32\r\n(Mr. Nejedly. Czechoslovakia)\r\nappreciation to the Agency\u0027s Director General, Mr. Bans Blix. Despite the\r\nexisting financial crisi~ of the I AEA he has been able, together with his\r\ncolleagues, to cope with the Agency\u0027s present demanding tasks pnd\r\nrequirements. We wish him and his colleagues much success in performing their\r\ntasks.\r\nMr. PAK (Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea): I join the\r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in\r\nrecognizing that the lAEA has been carrying out its main mission, that of\r\naccelerating the peaceful uses of atomic power. In recent years, the lAEA has\r\nmade sincere efforts to expand international cooperation in accelerating the\r\ndevelopment and use of nuclear energy, which is badly needed for e~onomic\r\ndevelopment, in strengthening nuclear safety and safeguards, and in increasing\r\ntechnical cooperation with developing countries.\r\nThe lAEA is engaged in positive cocperation with many regions and\r\ncountries in implementing the safeguards agreement and the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), in conformity with the desire of\r\nthe peoples of the world, who want to live in a ~uclear-weapon-free world in\r\nthis post-cold-war era. We-appreciate that.\r\nToday, the relations of cooperation between the Democratic People\u0027s\r\nRepublic of Korea and the IAEA are developing daily in the field of the\r\npeaceful utilization of nuclear energy. Technical data and various other\r\nkinds of information which the lAEA regularly provides us are useful in our\r\nresearch on the development of nuclear energy and on the use of isotopes, as\r\nwell as for the establishment of a system of nuclear safety, Jrotection\r\nagainst radiation, and safeguards.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.45\r\n33\r\n(Mr. Pat, Democratic People\u0027s\r\nRQPublic of Korea)\r\nAt the third session of the fifth Supreme People\u0027s Assembly, which was\r\nheld in 1974, the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea adopted a law on\r\natomic power, whieb constitutes the basis of all activities for the peacefUl\r\nuses of nuclear energy. In accordance with that law we have engaged, with\r\nbroad use of radioactive rays and radioisotopes in various domainG of the\r\nnational economy, in research with a view to establishing a ~-oriented\r\nplan of nuclear power development and to using nuclear energy in building a\r\nself-reliant national economy.\r\nIn the context of that process, our scientists and technicians have the\r\ncapability to build and run on their own a pilot atomic power plant making use\r\nof our own ~esources and technology. With that experience, they are\r\ncontinuing their efforts to put larger atomic power stations into operation by\r\nthe mid-1990s.\r\nIt is the consistent, principled policy of the Government of our republic\r\nto carry out the denuclearization of the Korean peninSUla by earnestly\r\nimplementing the noble ideas and mission set out in the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nSince the June meeting of the Board of\" Governors of the IAEA we have\r\naccepted two rounds of ad hoc inspections of our nuclear facilities by the\r\nAgency. Those were the second and third such ro~ds of inspections; the\r\nfollow-up regulations of the nuclear safeguards agreement have been agreed\r\nupon and carried out. Even after three rounds of ad hoc inspections of our\r\nnuclear facilities by the IAEA, we also provided members of the Agency with\r\nevery necessa~y accommodation to enable them to inspect any sites and\r\ninstallations, regardless of the initial lists of nuclear facilities we\r\npresented.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.45\r\n34-35\r\n(Mr. Pak. Democratic People\u0027s\r\nRepublic of Korea)\r\nAll these facts show that the more frequent the IAEA inspections of our\r\ncountry\u0027s nuclear facilities, the clearer the proof of the integrity of our\r\nGovernment\u0027s plan for nuclear-power development. Suspicion with respect to\r\nour nuclear programme is disappearing.\r\nAll that must be done to carry out the denuclearization of the Korean\r\npeninsula is to verify its status through the inspection of United States\r\nnuclear weapons and nuclear bases in south Korea. In fact, the nuclear issue\r\nhas arisen with respect to the Korean peninsula only since the United States\r\ndeployment of nuclear weapons in south Korea. We who are under a constant\r\nnuclear threat are in a position to do o~~ ~est to denuclearize the Korean\r\npeninsula by implementing the north-south joint declar~tion on the\r\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\r\nMany rounds of meetings of the North-South Joint Nuclear Control\r\nCommittee have taken place. but the Committee has so far failed to adopt rules\r\nof inspection to verify the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The\r\nreason we see no progress in the work of the North-South Joint Nuclear Control\r\nCommittee is that the United States and the south Korean authorities oppose\r\nthe inclusion of United States nuclear weapons and nuclear bases in an\r\nagreement for the implementation of the joint declaration and the rules of\r\ninspection. And, to make things worse. they are raising a hue and cry over\r\n\"special inspections\" and \"inspections of the same number\" of military bases,\r\nbases which do not fall under the authority of the North-South Joint Nuclear\r\nControl Committee, but which are supposed to be discussed in the North-South\r\nJoint Military Committee. In other words, they are in a position to\r\ncomplicate and delay the work of the North-South Joint Nuclear Control\r\nCommittee.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n36\r\n(Mr. Pak, Democratic People\u0027s\r\n~ublic of Korea)\r\nThe joint declaration on denuclearization, agreed upon by the north and\r\nthe south, is not being implemented because of the United States position to\r\nmaintain its nuclear bases in south Korea and the attitude of south Korea\r\nwhich could nnt exercise its sovereignty.\r\nMoreover, the fact that there still exist United States nuclear weapons\r\nin south Korea has been made public increases our feeling that it is urgent to\r\nimplement the north-south joint declaration on denuclearization.\r\nTherefore, we would like tc urge the south Korean authorities, if they\r\nreally want the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, to shun any foreign\r\ninterference and come out at the negotiating table in favour of inclUding\r\nUnited States nuclear weapons and nuclear bases in south Korea in the\r\nfollow-up agreement for the north-south joint declaration on denuclearization\r\nand the rules of inspection.\r\nWe sincerely hope that the United States, which is directly responsible\r\nfor the nuclear issue in the Korean peninsula, will take favourable measures\r\nso that the inspection of United States nuclear weapons and nuclear bases in\r\nsouth Korea can take place.\r\nWe will continue to make every sincere effort to show the consistency of\r\nthe peaceful nuclear policy of the Government of our Republic through IAEA\r\ninspections, and to accelerate the peaceful use of nuclear energy with the\r\ntechnical cooperation of the IAEA and its member States.\r\nWe will be loyal to our obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty,\r\nand, with patience and sincerity, will make active efforts to achieve the\r\nimmediate implementation of the joint declaration on the denuclearization of\r\nthe Korean peninSUla.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.45\r\n37\r\nMr. ROBINSON (United States of America): On behalf of the United\r\nStates, my delegation wishes to express its strong support for the draft\r\nresolution before the General Assembly today regarding the 1991 annual report\r\nsubmitted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). As my Government\r\nhas often stated, the lAEA is an or9anization of critical importance to the\r\ninternational community, including the United States. As demonstrated in its\r\nreport to the General Assembly, the Agency continues to play a vital role in\r\npromoting the peaceful uses of nuclear ene~gy and in fostering international\r\np\u0026ace and security. We would also like to commend Director General Bans Blix\r\nand the lAEA secretariat for the diligence and commitment they have\r\ndemonstrated in carrying out the Agency\u0027s statutory responsibilities,\r\nespecially in regard to the imp1emen~0tion of the Security Council resolutions\r\ndealing with Iraq.\r\nThe Agency\u0027s extensive, effective and unique system of safeguards\r\nprovides the f\u0027oundation of international cooperation in the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy\" The safeguards system provides important assurances that\r\ntransfers of nuclear technology and information will not be diverted for\r\nmilitary purposes and thereby undermine international peace and 3tability. In\r\nthe absence of the Agency\u0027s safeguards system, suspicion rather than trust\r\nwould dominate international nuclear trade. This in turn would likely lead to\r\na climate of tension rather than cooperation among States and place severe\r\nconstraints on international nuclear cooperation.\r\nFor the first time in the history of the IAEA safeguards system, a State\r\nParty to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) - Iraq -\r\nwas found to have violated its safeguards agreement with the IAEA by not\r\ndeclaring and submitting nuclear material activities to the Agency\u0027s\r\ninspection.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.~5\r\n38-40\r\n(Mr. RObinson, United States)\r\nFollowing the conflict in the Gulf, IAXA teams have been inspecting\r\nIraq\u0027s nuclear capabilities since May 1991 under the terms of United Nations\r\nSecurity Council resolution 687 (1991), which is directed at eliminating\r\nIraq\u0027s weapons of mass destruction and the means to produce and use them.\r\nWith the assistance of the United Nations Special Commission, the lAEA has\r\nresponded resourcefully and effectively to the challenges involved in\r\nfulfilling its task in Iraq. Despite frustrating and sometimes even hazardous\r\nconditions, Agency inspectors have shown courage and commitment in refusing to\r\nbe diverted from their goal. The IABA Board of Governors declared Iraq in\r\nviolation of its safeguards agreement at a special session in July 1991. It\r\nstrongly condemned the Government of Iraq for not submitting nuclear material\r\nand facilities in its clandestine uranium enrichment programme to the Agency\u0027s\r\ninspection, and expressed its grave concern about evident deception and\r\nobstruction of IAEA inspectors, who were denied access several times to sites\r\nthey wished to inspect. In accordance with its statute, the IAEA transmitted\r\nits conclusions to the United Nations Security Council.\r\nApart from raising questions about the true scope of Iraq\u0027s nuclear\r\ncapabilities, the inspections there have intensified efforts to take concrete\r\nsteps to strengthen the existing IAEA safeguards system. The IAEA Board of\r\nGovernors has recently reaffirmed the Agency\u0027s right to conduct special\r\ninspections in States with comprehensive safeguards agreements. Similarly,\r\nthe Board has called upon States with comprehensive safeguards agreements to\r\nprovide early design information o~ ~lans for construction of new nuclear\r\nfacilities, as well as modifications to existing ones, as soon as those plans\r\nare made.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.45\r\n41\r\n(Mr. Robinson, United States)\r\nThe Board has already given preliminary consideration to proposals on the\r\nreporting of exports and imports of nuclear material and of certain equipment\r\nand non-nuclear materials especially designed for use in nuclear activities.\r\nThe proposal remains an important Board agenda item.\r\nIn addition to all these measures, the secretariat continues to review\r\nits fundamental safeguards principles, criteria and procedures to improve\r\ntheir efficiency and effectiveness, particularly in light of increasing\r\ndemands placed on it due to new safeguards agreements. For example, the\r\nIAEA\u0027s Standing Advisory Group on Safeguards Implementation is considering a\r\nrange of other possible measures to enhance the safeguards system especially\r\nwith respect to the detection of undeclared nuclear activities.\r\nWith regard to the non-proliferation Treaty, at the same time that Iraq\r\nwas challenging the global norm against nuclear weapons proliferation, other\r\nnations took concrete steps to preserve it. The United States welcoMed\r\nSouth Africa\u0027s accession to the non-proliferation Treaty and conclusion of a\r\nfull-scope safeguards agreement with the Agency. We commend the IAEA for its\r\nintensive efforts to implement a full-scope safeguards agreement with the\r\nDemocratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea, and we urge the latter to continue its\r\ncooperation with the Agency, France and the People\u0027s Republic of China have\r\nalso recently acceded to the non-proliferation Treaty. We also look forward\r\nto the early conclusion of comprehensive safeguards agreements between the\r\nlAEA and Argentina and Brazil, and with the newly independent States of the\r\nformer Soviet Union. These efforts are positive steps in favour of extending\r\nthe non-proliferation Treaty, which is the foundation of the international\r\nnon-proliferation regime.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.45\r\n42\r\n(Mr. RObinson, United States)\r\nWith regard to technical cooperation, the 1991 IAEA annual report makes\r\nclear the extent of the Agency\u0027s provision of technical assistance to the\r\ndeveloping world. The IAEA has assisted countries .in all aspects of the\r\napplication of peaceful nuclear science and technology, from power planning\r\nand development and waste management to assistance in non-power nuclear\r\ntechnologies, including those related to agricUltural and animal production,\r\nfood irradiation, nuclear medicine and more. This is an important role which\r\nmy Government continues to support strongly, and we encourage other IAEA\r\nmember States to do the same.\r\nI come now to nuclear safety and radiological protection. In reflecting\r\nupon the Agency\u0027s accomplishments in nuclear safety and radiological\r\nprotection, we note with particular interest the ongoing project for\r\ninternational asaistance in assessing the safety of older nuclear reactors,\r\nwhich focuses on the Soviet-designed VVER-440/230 reactors. This project will\r\nprovide an important contribution to international efforts to improve the safe\r\noperation of these reactors. My Government looks forward to the IAEA\u0027s\r\ncontinuing efforts, in particular the evaluation of the graphite-moderated\r\nreactors.\r\nThe IAEA is taking the lead on the elaboration of an international\r\nnuclear safety convention. My Government believes that it is important that\r\nsuch an instrument be broadly supported and should focus on nuclear power\r\nreactors, which pose ·the greatest safety risks, and avoid an attempt to adopt\r\ndetailed technical rules or standards. The main value of a convention will be\r\nits implementation provisions for a meeting of the parties to provide peer\r\nreview of compliance with a broad set of essential safety principles.\r\nThe IAEA recently convened a review conference for the Convention on the\r\nPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material, which concluded that the Convention\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n. Al471PV.45\r\n43-45\r\n(Mr. Robinson, U~ited States)\r\nis adequate and acceptable in its current form and that no modifications to\r\nits text or annexes is warranted. Although universal adherence to this\r\ninstrument has not been obtained as yet, my Government remains committed to\r\nthis end.\r\nIn closing, my Government wishes to commend the IAEA for its invaluable\r\ncontribution to international peace, security and welfare. The United States\r\npledges its continuing support for the efforts of the !AEA.\r\nMr. ADEKANYE (Nigeria): The Nigerian delegation wishes to express\r\nits satisfaction with the annual report for 1991 of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) (A/47/374) on the activities of the Agency. We commend\r\nthe Director Ge~eral for his statement spelling out the challenges which the\r\nAgency must confront in a rapidly changing world.\r\nToday such challenges include the expansion of the Agency\u0027s role in\r\npromoting international cooperation in nuclear science and technology. We are\r\npleased to note that in the past year the Agency\u0027s activities in the field of\r\nnuclear applications were pursued with vigour and that the use of nuclear\r\ntechniques in food and agriculture, medicine and industry has continued to\r\ngrow, based on the needs and priorities of Member States.\r\nOn the African continent, the impact of the Agency\u0027s assistance in the\r\nsearch for lasting solutions to the continent\u0027s food problems is now widely\r\nrecognized. At its last session, the General Conference urged that the Agency\r\nintensify cooperation with other United Nations agencies such as the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health\r\nOrganization (WHO), as well as the International Consultative Group on Food\r\nIrradiation, to prepare a detailed project proposal that would assist\r\ndeveloping countries in introducing commercial food irradiation.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n.A/47/PV. 45\r\n46\r\n(Mr. Adekanye, Nigeria)\r\nFor my country, the contribu.tion of the Agency\u0027s technical assistance and\r\nresearch contract programmes to our national development has remained a source\r\nof satisfaction. We note, for example, that four recently completed projects,\r\ncovering the areas of nuclear science laboratories, nuclear analytical\r\ntechniques, radioimmunoassay in animal production, and food irradiation, are\r\nhaving a major impact. At the core of that assistance programme is the\r\ntransfer of nuclear technology and techniques. We look forward to an\r\nintensification of the Agency\u0027s training programme as part of its contribution\r\nto the development of our human resources so that the full benefits of such\r\ntransfers can truly be enjoyed.\r\nAgainst this background, my delegation notes with concern the decline in\r\nthe percentage of the target for and contributions to the Technical Assistance\r\nand Co-operation Fund. Now that targets have been agreed to for the period\r\n1993-95, we urge renewed commitment from all Member States to pay their\r\ncontributions as a demonstration of their concrete support for the Agency\u0027s\r\ntechnical assistance programme, from which developing countries derive such\r\nenormous benefits. The technical assistance programme should be funded\r\nthrough assured and predictable resources.\r\nA major instrument of the Agency\u0027s technical assistance to developing\r\ncountries is its regional cooperation programme. In the African region, the\r\nAfrican Regional Cooperative Agreement for Research, Development and Training\r\nRelated to Nuclear Science and Technology (AFRA) is gaining support as a\r\nvehicle for the development of African economies. AFRA membership has\r\nincreased by three during the year. This interest will grow as the\r\nhigh-priority projects identified by AFRA States are expeditiously\r\nimplemented. It is therefore our hope that greater support will continue to\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n. Al47/PV.45\r\n47\r\n(Mr. Adekanye, Nigeria)\r\nbe given to AFRA States by the international community and the donor countries\r\nto ensure the implementation of all AFRA projects.\r\nMy country has always accepted that safeguards constitute one of the\r\nprincipal activities of the Agency and that an effective role in that area is\r\nessential in strengthening confidence in the safeguards system, underpinning\r\nthe nuclear non-proliferation regime and promoting world peace. We have\r\ntherefore followed with great interest the Agency\u0027s efforts to meet the\r\nchallenges arising from increasing accession to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the application of IAEA safeguards.\r\nWe welcome the steps taken in the past year by the Agency in responding to\r\nthis growing demand for safeguards, as well as its determination to explore\r\nadditional avenues that would reinforce its obligations under international,\r\nmultilateral and regional agreements. It is essential for the credibility of\r\nthe safeguards system that the Agency continue to be guided by the principles\r\nof transparency and non-discrimination, efficiency and cost-effectiveness. As\r\nwe approach the 1995 non-proliferation Treaty review and extension Conference,\r\nthese principles will prove invaluable ~n confirming the Agency\u0027s functions\r\nassigned under the Treaty.\r\nMy delegation notes that some of these principles of the Agency\u0027s\r\nsafeguards system have already been subjected to test in the course of the\r\nDirector General\u0027s implementation of General Assembly resolution 46/34 A on\r\nSouth Africa\u0027s nuclear capabilities. His report on the verification of the\r\ncompleteness of the inventory of South Africa\u0027s nuclear installations and\r\nmaterial has been read carefully by my delegation. We consider it to be a\r\nmilestone in the continuing efforts of African countries to establish a\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone on our continent. We note that, in line with the\r\n•\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAJ47/PV.45\r\n48\r\n(Mr. Adekaqye, Nigeria)\r\nd9cision of the General Conference at its last session, the Director General\r\nwill continue to assist in that endeavour.\r\nCooperation between the Aqency and South Africa remains essential in\r\nremoving areas of doubt and restoring confidence in the peaceful nature of\r\nSouth Africa\u0027s nuclear progr~ne. Such confidence would be further bolstered\r\nif the stalled political and constitutional process were urgently revived so\r\nthat a non-racial democratic South Africa could resume its full participation\r\nin the Agency\u0027s activities. We therefore urge the Government of South Af~ica\r\nto complement the promised cooperation with the Agency by concrete action in\r\nthat regard.\r\nThe Rio Conference, inclUding comv~itrnents under Agenda 21 as well as the\r\nFramework Convention on Climatic Change signed on that occasion, signalled an\r\nimportant role for the International Atomic Energy Agency as well as other\r\nagencies in the United Nations system. The Agency must address, among other\r\nissues, global concerns over the safety of nuclear installations world wide to\r\nstrengthen confidence in nuclear power. Such a role goes beyond the\r\nachievement of an international nuclear-safety culture to assistance in the\r\nformulation of a convention on nuclear safety. It encompasses the\r\nstrengthening of international nuclear liability, combining the Vienna and\r\nParis Conventions in the field of civil liability. \u0027We urge the Agency not to\r\nrelent in its endeavour to facilitate intergovernmental cooperation on these\r\nimportant issues. It is our hope, too, that all Member States will\r\nparticipate actively in these efforts so as to ensure that all nuclear\r\ninstallations world wide are indeed safe and well-regulated and pose no danger\r\nto health and the environment.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/471PV.45\r\n49\r\n(Mr. Adekanye. Nigeria)\r\nPermit me to turn to the associated issue of the disposal of nuclear and\r\nradioactive waste. Whilst the Agency\u0027s assistance to developing countries in\r\nstrengthening radioactive waste management through the establishment of\r\nefficient disposal facilities for waste arising from isotope applications i~\r\nhospitals and industry is appreciated, the transboundary movement of\r\nhigh-level radioactive wastes has remained a source of major concern to my\r\ncountry. Since the I~A adopted the Code of Practice on the International\r\nTransboundary Movement of Radioactive Waste in 1990, many Member States,\r\nincluding Ni~~ria, have stressed the need to translate the lofty objectives of\r\nthe Code into a legally binding instrument. Recent events in the world have\r\ngiven added urgency to that need. Global concerns over transboundary movement\r\nof such waste can only be addressed through transp~rency and multilateral\r\ncommitments. In the meantime, we look forward to the outcome of the ongoing\r\nefforts by the Agency in formulating internationally agreed radioactive waste\r\nsafety standards that will ~einforce current gains.\r\nThis year marks the thirty-fifth anniversary of the International Ato~ic\r\nEnergy Agency. During that period it has fostered international cooperation\r\nin nucloar techniques ana applications and played a leading role in the area\r\nof safeguards. It remains the considered view of my country that neither of\r\nthe two roles should be,emphasized at the expense of the other. We therefore\r\nsupported the decision of the General Conference at its 1991 regular session\r\naffirming that, in order to fulfil the objectives of the Agency:\r\n\"an adequate balance should be achieved among the Agency\u0027s main\r\nactivities, having pt.. \u0027;ularly in mind \u0027safeguards and non-safeguards\r\nI\r\nactivities.\"\r\nI\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.45\r\nSO\r\n(Mr. Adekanye, Nigeria)\r\nProgress has been made in implementing that decision. We are encouraged that\r\nin the latest decision of the General Conference the enhancement of\u0027the\r\nAgency\u0027s technical cooperation activities through eftective programmes aimed\r\nat improving the scientific and technological capabilities of developing\r\n.\r\ncountries is once again stressed.\r\nThere is, however, an additional challenge on which little progress has\r\nbeen made: the need for the Aqency\u0027s decision-making organ, the Board of\r\nGovernors, to reflect the changed composition of the Agency\u0027s membership.\r\nSince 1978 the issue of an increase in representation of two areas - Africa,\r\nand the Middle East and South Asia - has engaged the attention of the Board of\r\nGovernors and the General Conference.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n·.\r\n.Al47/PV.45\r\n51\r\n(Mr. Adekaoye, Nigeria)\r\nWe believe that the Agency cannot and should not stand apart from the powerful\r\ncross-currents of reform and restructuring currently sweeping through the\r\nentire United Nations system. Events on our continent in the nuclear field\r\nmake Africa\u0027s representation on that policy-making body a pressing necessity.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to reaffirm its faith in the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. By responding creatively to the changing\r\nneeds and priorities of Member States, especially developing countries, it has\r\ncontributed to the development of science and technology through new\r\ntechnclc9ie~ end their ~pplications. It has not only strengthened the\r\nnon-proliferation regime and restored confidence in its safeguards system, but\r\nhas also continued to serve as a mechanism for intergovernmental cooperation\r\nin nuclear science and technology.\r\nMy delegation is confident that the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nwill continue to serve the interests of all its members. What the Agency\r\nneeds most is an unambiguous demonstration by all member States of their\r\ncommitment and political will to provide the Agency with the necessary\r\nresources to perform, in an efficient and cost-effective manner, the tasks\r\nentrusted to it under the Statute.\r\nMr. MONTANa (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish): Mr. Bans Blix\r\nhas presented to us a d~tailed overview of the important activities carried\r\nout by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) over the last year. His\r\nstatement makes clear the increase in the Agency\u0027s growing tasks and\r\nresponsibilities and the major challenges it faces. As in previous years, my\r\ndelegation expresses its gratitude to Mr. Bliz for the information he has\r\nprovided, and assures him of Mexico\u0027s firm and continued support for his\r\nleadership and for the work of the Agency. Along with the annual report of\r\n,\r\nI\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n•\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n52\r\n(Mr, Montano. Mexico)\r\nthe lAEA, the statement by the Director General makes it possible for us to\r\nmake assessments of the Agency\u0027s work, the range of its activities and the\r\ndifficulties - and opportunities - that it will face from now ~n.\r\nThere can be no doubt that one of the first issues deserving our\r\nattention is the financial situation of the Agency, which has not been spared\r\nthe difficulties besetting other members of the system of multilateral\r\norganizations in obtaining in a timely manner and in sufficient quantity the\r\nresources we are all obliged to contribute. It is surprising that the growing\r\ndemands for bodies such as the IAEA to carry out new or more ambitious\r\nactivities are not accompanied by the necessary commitment to disburse the\r\nresourceu to support these responsibilities. We appeal for an end to this\r\nsituation, which affects US all and is leading to an erosion in the ability of\r\nthe multilateral system as a whole to act.\r\nMexico has traditionally maintained that the IAEA is intrinsically a body\r\nwith two complementary objectives: first, guaranteeing global security in the\r\nuse of nuclear power and materials by means of a system of safeguards system,\r\nand, secondly, assisting development by promoting cooperation in the peaceful\r\nuses of nuclear power. This is a dual function, which must not be changed or\r\nthrown out of balance. As Mexico sees \"it, any attempt, deliberate or\r\notherwise, to alter this balance can only be to the detriment of the Agency\r\nand the·support it receives from Member States.\r\nIn this context, we are concerned about the fact that as a result of the\r\nfinancial difficulties the Agency is experiencing research contracts have been\r\nseriously affected, as is clearly indicated in the Agency\u0027s report. These\r\ncontracts are the very core of the Agency\u0027s operations in promoting\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n53\r\n(Mr. Montano, Mexico)\r\nnuclear science and technology to solve problems in Member States annd are\r\nperhaps ona of the most important cooperative efforts in the system.\r\nOur concern is heightened when we consider the remarkable successes the\r\nAgency has had in this area of its activities. Programmes such as the\r\ncampaign to eradicate the New World Screwworm in North Africa, crop production\r\nand environmental protection are clear examples of the Agency\u0027s constructive\r\npotential in this field.\r\nOn the issue of safeguards, we also recognize the important work the\r\nAgency has continued to carry out. Its efforts in discharging its mandate\r\nunder Security Council resolutions have been laudable, but we continue to\r\nmaintain that those resolutions are, and must be, of an exceptional\r\ncharacter. The IAEA must keep unchanged its nature and ma~date as a technical\r\nbody, avoiding being politicized and not extrapolating axtraordinary cases as\r\nif they were to become guidelines for the future.\r\nThe Mexican delegation would like to stress that security is a collective\r\nresponsibility. There are two fundamental lessons to be drawn from the\r\nactivities of the IAEA under Security Council resolution 687 (1991). The\r\nfirst, which has already been the subject of a ruling by the Board of\r\nGovernors, is that a Member State failed to fulfil its safeguards\r\nobligations. But the second, and perhaps the more important, is that this\r\nbreach occurred because of the transfer of material and other resources.\r\nIn this context, although we are indeed grateful for the Agency\u0027s\r\ndecisions aimed at strengthening its safeguards system, we cannot fail to\r\npoint out that this is only a partial solution to a bigger problem that\r\nrequires the attention of the General Assembly. We ought to consider\r\nI\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.45\r\n54-55\r\n(Mr. Montano, MexicQ)\r\ntQgether the rQot causes Qf prQblems Qf pQssible nQn~cQmpliance safeguards,\r\nand strengthen the undertakings designed t.Q aVQid them.

In order to put all the facts before the representatives here present\r\nin the General Assembly concerning the question of Iraq\u0027s compliance with the\r\nprovisions of Security Council resolution 687 (1991) in the nuclear field, I\r\nshould like to point out .that Iraq took a number of practical steps in\r\nimplementing the provisions stipulated in resolution 687 (1991). I shall deal\r\nwith those provisions and measures in detail, as follows.\r\nFirst, paragraph 11 of resolution 687 (1991) invited Iraq to reaffirm\r\nunconditionally its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear weapons. Iraq has implemented this paragraph through the Foreign\r\nMinister\u0027s letter of 18 April 1991 to the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations and the President of the Security Council, wherein he stated:\r\n\"In accordance with paragraph 11 of resolution 687, the Iraqi\r\nGovernment reaffirms anew and unconditionally Iraq\u0027s obligations under\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 1 July 1968.\"\r\nIraq also reaffirmed this undertaking in the Foreign Minister\u0027s letter to\r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations dated 7 July 1991, as well as his\r\nletter of 28 August 1991~ which stated:\r\n\"Iraq reaffirms anew its full commitment to its international\r\nobligations, including the Treaty ,n the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons and the safeguards agreement with the IAEA.\"\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI\r\nI\r\nA/471PV.45\r\n57\r\n(Mr. Malik. I~ag)\r\nSecondly, paragraph 12 of resolution 687 (1991) requested that Iraq\r\nshould agree not to acquire or develop nuclear weapons or\r\nnuclear-weapons-usable material or any subsystems or components or any\r\nresearch, development, support or manufacturing facilities related to the\r\nabove. Iraq implemented this provision in the following manner:\r\n(a) The Foreign Minister addressed a letter to the Secretary-Gene~\".l of\r\nthe United Nations on 18 April 1991, which stated:\r\n\"In accordance with paragraph 12 of resolution 687, Iraq\r\nunconditionally agrees not to acquire or develop nuclear weapons or\r\nnuclear-weapons-usable material or any subsystems or components or any\r\nresearch, development, support or manufacturing facilities related to the\r\nabove-mentioned\".\r\n(b) The letter of the Foreign Minister addressed to the Director General\r\nof the lAEA on 10 October 1991 reaffirmed anew this commitment. It stated:\r\n\"I should like to reaffirm anew that Iraq has ceased all its nuclear\r\nactivities since the beginning of the aggression against it on the night\r\nof 16 January 1991 and after the adoption of resolution 687 of 1991. In\r\naccordance with its obligations under the resolution, Iraq decided to\r\ncease its nuclear programme\".\r\nThe Foreign Minister went on to state in another paragraph of his letter:\r\n\"The Iraqi Government reaffirms anew that Iraq has never endeavoured\r\nto acquire nuclear weapons, that the political leadership in Iraq has\r\nnever at any time whatsoever made a decision to direct the research\r\ncarried out by the Iraqi scientists specialized in the fi~ld of atomic\r\nenergy towards the manufacturing of any form of nuclear weapons.\"\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.45\r\n58-60\r\n(Mr. Malik • ..Il:2g)\r\n(c) The head of the Iraqi Atomic Energy Organization met with the head\r\nof the nuclear inspection team, David Kaye, an American intelligQnca officer,\r\non 9 August 1991. During that meeting, he provided Mr. Kaye with a\r\ncomprehensive review of the research carried out by Iraq in the nuclear\r\nfield. He clarified that the Iraqi programme is not what some oth(!r parties\r\nwould like to portray as an attempt that may have been close to achieving its\r\nobjective, that is, the acquisition of nuclear weapons. In that review, he\r\nset forth the reasons for Iraq\u0027s opting for the enrichment process while\r\nrenouncing the building of nuclear-power reactors. The head of the inspection\r\nteam, in the course of that meeting, said that the Iraqi side was cooperative\r\n~d that what his team had accomplished in its inspection round represented\r\nthe beginning of the end of finalizing the assessment of the size of the Iraqi\r\nprogramme. He also said that the Iraqi programme in its current state does\r\nnot contain anything that could lead to the production of a nuclear weapon.\r\n(d) The Iraqi Governor at the IAEA during the meeting of the Board of\r\nGovernors and the General Conference of the Agency on 6 May, 18 July and\r\n20 September 1991 expounded fully the peaceful nature of the nuclear programme\r\nin Iraq. Also, the statement made by the permanent representative of Iraq to\r\nthe United Nations in the Security Council on 11 October 1991 and the letter\r\nof the Chairman of the Iraqi side addressed to the head of the seventh nuclear\r\ninspection team on 14 October 1991 all contained additional information that\r\nreaffirm that commitment. That letter contained the following:\r\nI\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n61\r\n(Mr. Malik, Iraq)\r\nThe latter contained a reaffirmation of Iraq\u0027s renunciation of its\r\nnuclear programme. It also stated that research and studies into armamonts\r\nhad been made, but no political decision to manufacture nuclear weapons had\r\nbeen taken. All the research and studies carried out were experimental in\r\nnature and not aimed at the production of weapons. There is no programme for\r\nthe production of nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices.\r\nOperative paragraph 12 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991) also\r\ndecided that Iraq should submit to the Secretary-General and the Director\r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) within 15 days of the\r\nadoption of that resolution a declaration of the locations, amounts and types\r\nof all nuclear-weapons-usable materials, their components and manufacturing\r\nfacilities. Iraq has implemented that provision by taking the following steps:\r\n(a) The Iraqi Foreign Minister addressed letters to the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General and the Director General of the IAEA on 18 April 1991,\r\n27 Apr.il 1991, 7 July 1991, 10 July 1991, 12 August 1991 and 28 August 1991,\r\nall of which contained information, tables and annexes declaring the\r\nlocations, amounts and Itypes of all items and materials specified in operative\r\nparagraph 12 of resolution 687 (1991), whether subject to Agency safeguards or\r\nnot. In addition, the letters contained answers to queries put by the IAEA\r\nand lists of equipment and locations of interest to the Special Commission, as\r\nwell as clarifications with regard to the history and nature of the Iraqi\r\nnuclear programme, which was devoted solely to peaceful purposes.\r\n(b) Twenty-six letters were addressed by the Iraqi counterpart to the\r\nheads of the inspection teams, containing answers to questions. put by the\r\nheads of the teams as well as questions put by the IAEA.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n62\r\n(Mr. Malik. Iraq)\r\n(c) There are three records of the surrender of documents to the sixth\r\ninspection team on 20 and 23 September 1991.\r\nF~urthly, operative paragraph 12 of resolution 687 (1991) requested Iraq\r\nto place all of its nuclear-weapons-usable materials under the exclusive\r\ncontrol, for custody and removal, of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\r\nIraq has implemented that provision in the following manner:\r\n(a) The Iraqi Foreign Minister addressed a letter to the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General on 18 April 1991, in which he stated that \"the Iraqi\r\nGovernment agreed to place all its nuclGar-wG~pcns-uBablematerials under the\r\nexclusive control of the International Atomic Energy Agency\".\r\n(b) The materials covered by resolution 687 (1991) were handed over to\r\nthe inspection teams. The teams carried out the following procedures: all\r\nnuclear materials were placed under Agency seal; parts singled out by the\r\nteams were destroyed; raw Russian fuel, as well as plutonium and uranium, were\r\nmoved outside Ir~q; two high-speed heavy cameras were removed from Iraq and\r\nall hot cells were sealed, rendering them harmless, together with the\r\nmechanical robot arms.\r\nFifthly, paragraph 12 of resolution 687 (1991) requested Iraq to accept,\r\nin accurdance with the arrangements provided for in paragraph 13 of the\r\nresolution, urgent on-site inspection and the destruction, removal or\r\nrendering harmless as appropriate of all items specified in paragraph 12.\r\nThat provision was implemented by Iraq in the following manner:\r\n(a) The Foreign Minister addressed a letter to the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General on 6 April 1991 which specified Iraq\u0027s acceptance of\r\nresolution 687 (1991).\r\n(b) The Foreign Minister addressed a letter to the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General on 18 April 1991 in which he stated that the Iraqi\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.45\r\n(Mr. Malik, Irag)\r\nGovernment agreed to the arrangements set forth in paragraph 13 of\r\nresolution 687 (1991).\r\n(c) During the period from 15 May 1991 through mid-October 1992, 14\r\nnuclear inspection teams visited Iraq. With the exception of the two teams\r\nheaded by David Kaye, the American intelligence officer, the teams carried out\r\ntheir tasks in the country with the full cooperation of the Iraqi side. Among\r\nthe facilities provided to the teams by the Iraqi authorities are the\r\nfollowing: logistical support; administrative and medical services; technical\r\nservices, that is, assistance in the destruction of equipment and machinery;\r\nassistance in the transportation of unused fuel out of Iraq; the placing of\r\nall nuclear materials in one site to facilitate verification and monitoring\r\nprocesses; the provision of on-site headquarters for the inspection teams and\r\nthe handing-over of documents and plans; the placing of equipment and\r\nmachinery at Al Twetha site-to facilitate the verification process. All the\r\ninspection teams have commended the Iraqi side for its cooperation and its\r\nprovision of all data requested, as well as for giving serious and credible\r\nanswers to all their queries.\r\nAs for the problems that arose during the visits of the two teams headed\r\nby David Raye, they did arise from the conduct of the head of the two teams\r\nand some of their members, who had intentionally created problems in order to\r\nserve certain political objectives of the countries for which they \"ork. The\r\nsecond nuclear inspection team insisted on carrying out an inspection during\r\nthe Holy Feast of Sacrifice. The sixth nuclear inspection team went into the\r\nadministrative buildings of the Atomic Energy Board, stealing personnel files\r\nof the employees and sending them to Washington and not to the Special\r\nCommission.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n--~--------_._--\r\nAl4i-lPV•. 45\r\n64-65\r\n(Mr. Mali~R Irag)\r\nTh\"! French newspaper Liberation, in its issue dated 22 October 1991,\r\nquoting a doctor who was a member of the David Kaye team, reported that the\r\nlatter had purposely clashed with the Iraqi authorities to provide a cover for\r\na new American act of aggression against Iraq.\r\n(d) All the nuclear inspection teams that visited Iraq inspected more\r\nthan 60 sites in all parts of the country. More than half of the sites\r\ninspected were unrelated to the Iraqi nuclear programme. The inspection teams\r\nspent 3,449 working days in Iraq, during which they carried out 2\u002719 inspection\r\nvisits, including 106 visits and return visits to the sites of Iraq\u0027s nuclear\r\nprogramme, 60 visits to support sites and 47 visits to sites totally unrelated\r\nto the programme.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n----~---\r\n~!471PV\u003d45\r\n66\r\n(Mr. Malik, Iraq)\r\nThese included visits to the prison at Mousel, the main sewage plant at\r\nBaghdad, a civilian shelter and the fields of a privately owned field. T11e\r\ninspection teams have made 40 surprise visits and have taken 600 specimens for\r\nradiation tests. They ha~e supervised the destruction of more than 2,000\r\nitems of materials and equipment and the demolition of buildings on 47,750\r\nsquare metres, at AI-Ethir, Hatin, Tarmia and AI-Shourkat. The inspection\r\nteams have sealed over 900 items of material, machinery and equipment and have\r\ndestroyed 4,000 tonnes of iron used in the EMIS programme.\r\nBefore the inspection teams carried out thei~ destruction procedur~s,\r\nIraq had voluntarily destroyed more than 26,000 items such as spare parts,\r\nmachines and other equipment, all of which were subsequently scrutinized by\r\nthe inspection teams themselvEs. We also destroyed large quantities of raw\r\nmaterials, including 1,500 tonnes of Margin steel.\r\nDr. Zefirero, leader of the most recent nuclear inspection team, has\r\nstated that the Iraqi nuclear programme has becr....~ \"zero\"; that is the whole\r\ntruth.\r\nMr. Blix may recall that in New York, on 12 March 1992, the head of the\r\nIraqi atomic-energy organization furnished him with a document containing a\r\nfull and final report on Iraq\u0027s nuclear programme. We were told that this\r\nreport was sent to 150 experts and specialists all over the world. Mr. Blix\r\nwill,also recall that only 24 questions were put to us on that report) the\r\nanswers to those questions were either contained in the report itself or in\r\nletters from the Iraqi side to the leaders of the inspection teams.\r\nSixth, the Security Council resolutions asked Iraq to cease all nuclear\r\nactivities of any kind with the exception of the use of isotopes for medical,\r\nagricultural and industrial purposes. Iraq has implemented that request in\r\nthe following manner:\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/471PV.45\r\n67\r\n(Mr. Malik,....1!:E)\r\n(a) Between 24 July to 10 October 1991, the Foreign Minister addressed\r\n~\r\nt\r\nfive letters to the United Nations Secretary-General and the IAEA, in which he\r\nmade it clear that Iraq had ~enounced all nuclear activities and that its\r\nprevious activities no longer existed either on the practical or on the\r\nscientific levels owing to the destruction inflicted on the Iraqi nuclear\r\nfacilities by the aggression of the coalition forces.\r\n(b) The head of the Iraqi atomic-energy organization reaffirmed to the\r\nleader of the fourth inspection team that, as a result of the total\r\ndestruction of its scientific facilities, Iraq had been rendered incapable of\r\ncontinuing its scientific activities. The team members saw for themselves the\r\nextent of the destruction inflicl~d on those facilities and agreed that they\r\nhave become unusable.\r\n(c) The inspection teams that visiteC Iraq reported no activities\r\ncontravening these above obligations.\r\nSeventh, Security Council resolutions asked Iraq to cease all movement\r\nand destruction of materials or equipment related to nuclear weapons or to\r\nother nuclear activities without notifying the Special Commission and\r\nobtaining its prior approval. Iraq has implemented this stipulation in the\r\nfollowing manner:\r\n(a) On 28 August 1991, the Foreign Minister addressed a letter to the\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General stating that Iraq had decided as of\r\n28 June 1991 to cease the movement and destruction of all materials or\r\nequipment related to Security Council resolution 687 (1991).\r\n(b) The nuclear inspection teams that visited Iraq have verified this.\r\nAn agreement was reached with the third nuclear inspection team on moving some\r\nequipment to other sites to facilitate the supervision of that equipment. The\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n68\r\n(Mr. MaliJc, Irag)\r\nequipment was transported under the supervision of members from the team. A\r\nquantity of yellow salt \u0027tfas moved from Takrit to Al-Tw~itha at the request of\r\nthe seventh nuclear inspection team; the mQve was verified by the eighth\r\ninspection team. The seventh nuclear inspection team also requested that lots\r\nof uranium dioxide be moved from site D to site C within Al-Tweitha. And Iraq\r\nrequested the movement of liquid wastes containing uranium from Kissek to the\r\nAI-Jezira laboratory; approval was not obtained until Agency inspectors were\r\npresent for the move. Iraq has implemented all this in a straightforward\r\nmanner and none of the inspection teams that visited Iraq has reported\r\nanything to the contrary.\r\nEighth, Iraq has dealt in a positiv~ manner with the IAEA safeguards\r\nagreement and its annexes. Since November 1991, the competent authorities\r\nhave transmitted the required information, and subsequently this information\r\nhas b~en updated continuously.\r\nIn his statement to the Security Council on 11 March 1992 concerning\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 707 (1991) and 715 (1991), Mr. Tariq Aziz, Deputy\r\nPrime Minister of Iraq, reaffirmed that respect for Iraq\u0027s sovereignty,\r\nsecurity and its legitimate right to progress and science would create the\r\nclimate necessary for a just and equitable implementation of Iraq\u0027s\r\nobligations under those two resolutions.\r\nNinth, in its resolution 687 (1991) the Security Council\r\n\"Takes note that the actions to be taken by Iraq in paragraphs 8, 9,\r\n10, 11, 12 and 13 of the present resolution represent steps towards the\r\ngoal of establishing in the Middle East a zone free from weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and all missiles for their delivery and the objective of a\r\nglobal ban on chemical weapons\". (Security Council resolution 687 (1991),\r\npara. 14)\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.4S\r\n69-70\r\n(Mr. Malik, Irag)\r\nMost regrettably, the Secu~ity Council has totally ignored that paragraph\r\nand has taken no steps towarda its implementation. To the contrary, the\r\nCouncil, in its resolution \u0027lIS (1991), postponed all movement towards the\r\nestablishment of such a zone pending the implementation of the future plan to\r\nmonitor Iraq\u0027s compliance with Security Council resolution 687 (1991). Thus,\r\nthe Security Council and the States that wield power over it have permitted\r\nIsrael tc increase its arsenal of weapons of mass destruction with impunity.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.45\r\n71\r\n(Hr. Halike Iraq)\r\nIt is also regrettable that the Security Council has not taken the\r\nmeasures necessary fo~ the implementation of its resolution 487 (1981), which\r\ndemanded that Israel place its nuclear facilities under international control\r\nafter its aggression against the Iraqi Osirak reactor, which was for peaceful\r\npurposes.\r\nFrom the foregoing it becomes quite clear that Iraq has fully met its\r\nobligations concerning the provisions of resolution 687 (1991). A number of\r\nfair and objective statements by the heads of the inspection teams have\r\npointed out the cooperation by the Iraqi authorities. The reasons why some\r\nars raising doubts and levelling false accusations concerning Iraq\u0027s alleged\r\nnon-compliance with the provisions of the above-mentioned resolution are very\r\nclear indeed. They have an ulterior political motive that has nothing to do\r\nwith the implemen.tation of the resolution.\r\nThe three permanent Western members of the Security Council, foremost of\r\nwhich is the United States of America, constantly, unreservedly and publicly\r\ndeclare that they wish to change the political leadership of Iraq, despite the\r\nfact that this runs blatantly counter to the Charter of the United Nations and\r\nthe content of the resolutions of the Security Council itself. The objective\r\nof those three States is to blackmail Iraq and put it in the position of the\r\naccused so as to use their trumped up charges in maintaining the unjust\r\neconomic embargo against the people of Iraq. They wish to take advantage of\r\nthe situation in order to be able to threaten the use of military force\r\nagainst Iraq whenever they wish, realize their ii~egitimate wish to change the\r\nregime in Iraq and destroy the Iraqi economy.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n-----------~_._ .._----\r\nAl411PV.45\r\n72\r\n(Mr. Malik, Irag)\r\nThe people of Iraq have made great contributions to human civilization.\r\nThe mUl:leums of Europe are full of the achievements of this people\u0027s great\r\ncivilization. Abraham, the father of all prophets, was one of them. Our\r\npeople invented writing and established the first legal system in the world\r\nthat determined rights and duties. Now this people is being subjected to a\r\nblatant injustice. Huw lung- will this proud people put up with this\r\ninjustice, and how long will humanity tolerate it?\r\nPlacing these facts before the General Assembly, the delegation of Iraq\r\nhopes that all States will view objectively the steps taken by Iraq for the\r\nimplementation of the provisions of resolution 687 (1991) and that those\r\nStates will arrive at the right conclusion. Iraq also hopes that all States\r\nwill work with us to lift the economic embargo against the people of Iraq\r\nsince all the causes for its imposition have cea~ed to exist, in accordance\r\nwith the Security Council resolutions.\r\nMr. NEAGU (Romania) (interpretation from French): The report on the\r\nactivities of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) offers us a\r\nconvincing picture of the scope of the Agency\u0027s activities and the progress\r\nmade in tho implementation of its programmes. We should like to pay tribute\r\nto the Director General and his secretariat for their success in taking on the\r\ntasks that were entrusted to them in spite of a host of difficulties,\r\ninclUding financial.\r\nIn view of the intrinsic links between the basic functions of the Agency,\r\nwe support the need to strengthen cooperation and technical assistance along\r\nwith activities for nuclear safeguards and safety, thus guaranteeing better\r\nand more fruitful international cooperation and enhancing the development of\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA147/PV.45\r\n73\r\n(Mr. Neagu. Romania)\r\nThe Romanian Government is grateful to the Agency and its member States\r\nfor the technical assistance it has been prQvided in various forms.\r\nInternational cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy is part and\r\nparcel of our policy in the sphere of nuclear energy based on advanced\r\ntechnology, such as in the case of the CANDU reactors. To this end, a major\r\ncontract was signed this year with partners in Canada and Italy for one of the\r\nmost important investment projects undertaken by our State, aiming at the\r\nstart of operations of the first part of the nuclea~ facility at Cernavoda in\r\n1995.\r\nRomania gives high priority to the Agency\u0027s activities for implementing\r\nsafeguards on the use of nuclear energy and improving the operation of its\r\nsafeguards system, which plays a key role in preventinq the proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons and contributes to the development of cooperation and\r\ninternational trade with regard to nuclear material, eguipment and technology.\r\nOur view on safeguards is clear: Romania is a Party to the\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty (~) and has agreed to its comprehensive safeguards\r\nregime. By the same token, it has made comprehensive safeguards a condition\r\nof any cooperation or provision of material in the nuclear sphere. Romania\r\nhas also sUbscribed to the guidelines of the group of nuclear exporters and\r\nthe guidelines on both nuclear transfers and the transfer of dual-purpose\r\nnuclear material, equipment and technology.\r\nRecent events have shown the need for sustained efforts in order to\r\nstrengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime and make the NPT truly\r\nuniversal.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n74-75\r\n(Mr. Neagu, Romania)\r\nne role played by the Agency in the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolution 687 (1991) confirmed the need to strengthen the safeguards system\r\nand to qive the Agency the means to ensure that nuclear energy is used for\r\npeaceful purposes only. We should like to commend the Director General and\r\nhis colleagues for the competent and efficient manner in which they have\r\ncarried out the complex missions entrusted to the Aqency by the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn a world which needs energy but is also concerned about pollution and\r\nthe deterioration of the environment, nuclear safety and radiation protection\r\nshould be qiven hiqh priority in the Aqency\u0027s programme. We attach special\r\nattention to these activities, and we note with satisfaction th~t the expanded\r\nproqramme on nuclear safety, adopted after the Chernobyl accident, has had\r\npositive effects in science and technology and also in terms of the\r\ncredibility of nuclear energy amonq the public.\r\n- -----------\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/471PV.45\r\n76\r\n(Mr, Neagu, Romania)\r\nBecause of the obvious importance of a convention on nuclear safety, we\r\nhave decided to take an active part in the preparation of a draft which would\r\nfill gaps in intern~tionalrulesand regulations and provide increased\r\nprotection for society and for the environment.\r\nLike many other countries, Romania is seriously concerned over the\r\ninadequate state of certain olde~ nuelea~ ~eaetors situated in the region. We\r\nwelcome the activities undertaken by the Agency to evaluate and improve the\r\nsafety of those reactors. To shut them down completely would cause energy\r\nproblems in the countries that use them; but an accident could have disastrous\r\nconsequences for everyone.\r\nRomania is resolved to see to it that the nuclear facility at Cernavoda\r\nfunctions in conditions guaranteed to meet the highest international nuclear\r\nsafety standards. At the same time, the Romanian Government will strengthen\r\nits national body dealing with nuclear rules and regulations. We thank the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the assistance recently given us\r\nin this sphere, especially the recommendations of the group of experts which\r\nvisited Romania this year.\r\nThe Romanian Parliament has just ratified the Vienna Convention on civil\r\nliability for nuclear damage and the Joint Protocol relating to the\r\nApplication of the Vienna Convention and the Paris Convention.\r\nMy delegation has become a sponsor of the draft resolution on the report\r\nof the IAEA. We feel that the draft reflects the current objectives and\r\nconcerns regarding the activities of the IAEA in an adequate and balanced\r\nmanner.\r\nSince its establishment, the IAEA has been very successful in carrying\r\nout its noble task of ensuring promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nenergy while contributing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.4S\r\n71\r\n(Mr. Heagu, Romania)\r\nsafety ef nuclear installations, the development of its member States through\r\ntechnical assistance programmes, and international cooperation. Romania is\r\nresolved to qive the Agency its full support so that it can discharge in an\r\never improving manner its functions and responsibilities, which have already\r\nassumed world-wide importance.\r\nMr. LEE (Republic of Korea): On behalf of the Government of the\r\nRepublic of Korea, I should like to express my appreciation to Mr. Bans Blix,\r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for his\r\nimportant statement yesterday afternoon introducing the 1991 annual report of\r\nthe Agency.\r\nMy delegation would also like ~o congratulate the Director General and\r\nthe secretariat of the IAEA on its thirty-fifth anniversary and commend their\r\nhard work and significant contribution in promoting the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear energy and in preventing its \"se for military purposes for more than\r\nthree decades.\r\nWe also welcome the admission of the Republics of Croatia, Slovenia and\r\nUzbekistan to membership of the IAEA at the thirty-sixth session of the\r\nGeneral Conference last month.\r\nMy delegation has noted with satiSfaction the Agency\u0027s accomplishments\r\nover the last 12 months in both the promotional and the r.egulatory aspects of\r\nits activities. One of the areas to which my Government attaches great\r\nimportance is non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the role of the IAEA in\r\nimplementing and strengthening the safeguards system.\r\nOver the past year, significant developments have taken place in favour\r\nof non-proliferation and the strengtheniug of safeguards. In the field of\r\nDon-proliferation, the two declared nuclear-weapon States, China and France,\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n78\r\n(Mr, Lee. Republic of Korea)\r\nhave finally acceded to the non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), a welcome and\r\nimportant step towards achieving a truly universal non-proliferation regime.\r\nThe newly independent States with siqnificant nuclear activities which\r\nwere part of the former Soviet Union, such as the Baltic States, Ukraine,\r\nKazakhstan and Belarus, are also expected to join the NPT as non-nuclear-\r\nweapon States in the not-too-distant future,\r\nThe accession of more nuclear and non-nuclear States to the NPT augurs\r\nwell for the successful conclusion of the 1995 Review Conference to extend the\r\nNPT. Furthermore, Argentina and Brazil have agreed to open up their nuclear\r\nactivities to each other and to lAEA inspection. The Tlatelolco Treaty is\r\nalso likely to enter into force in the near future and render the entire area\r\nof Latin America a nuclear-weapon-free-zone.\r\nRegarding South Africa, last month the lAEA General Conference, after\r\n~xamining the report of the Director General on the result of the lAEA\u0027s\r\nthorouqh inspection and verification of all South Africa\u0027s nuclear\r\ninstallations over the last year, decided to remove the item on South Africa\u0027s\r\nnuclear capabilities from its agenda for the next session.\r\nThe Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea, after a delay of more than six\r\nyears, finally concluded a safeguards agreement with the lAEA, which entered\r\ninto force in May this year. Yet it would seem to be still too early for the\r\nlAEA to make any judgement on the completeness and accuracy of the ~nitial\r\ninventory report by the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea. I shall revert\r\nto this issue later.\r\nWith respect to the strengthening of the lAEA safeguards system, my\r\ndelegation welcomes the measures taken by its Board of Governors, and\r\nsubsequently endorsed by the General Conference in Vienna, to strengthen the\r\nsafeguards system and improve its effectiveness and cost efficiency.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n79-80\r\n(Mr. Lee, Republic of Jorea)\r\nMy delegation also welcomes the Agency\u0027s reaffirmation of its existing\r\nright to undertake special inspections, which could help the Agency deal with\r\nany clandestine nuclear activities. The endorsement of the Director General\u0027s\r\nproposal for the earlier provision of design information was also a welcome\r\nachievement.\r\nWe also beli2ve that the proposed system of universal reporting of\r\nexports and imports of nuc~ear material and sensitive equipment, which has yet\r\nto be finalized through further consultations, could contribute to increasing\r\ntransparency and building confidence between both nuclear and non-Duclear\r\nStates.\r\nWe encourage the Agency to devise soon new proposals accommodating the\r\nvarious concerns of the member States, making it possible for an efficient and\r\nviable reporting regime based on the principles of non-discrimination and\r\nuniversality to be put into effect at an early date.\r\nIn view of the increasing requirements of the Agency\u0027s safeguards\r\nactivities vis-a-vis States developing nuclear energy, and considering the\r\nAgency\u0027s continued financial difficulties, it has become all the more\r\nnecessary and urgent to streamline and rationalize the Agency\u0027s safeguards\r\nsystem. While fully supporting the Director General\u0027s effort to explore\r\ndesirable measures in this respect, my delegation believes that the\r\nstreamlining or cost-saving measures should be considered without sacrificing\r\nthe effectiveness of the safeguards system itself.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.45\r\n81\r\n(Mr. Lee, Republic of ~)\r\nMy Government is willing to contribute through active participation in\r\nthe process of consultation on this matter, including participation in the\r\nStanding Advisory Group on Safequards Implementation.\r\nAs Mr. B1ix pointed out in his statement, we are moving into a\r\npost-cold-war world, when fewer resources might be used for military purposes,\r\nincluding nuclear weapons - a development that favours non-proliferation at\r\nthe global level. In this context, my delegation wishes once aqa~n to draw\r\nthe attention of the General Assembly to the initiatives and the commitment of\r\nthe Government of the Republic of Korea with respect to non-proliferation in\r\nour part of the world.\r\nIn December last year, following President Roh Tae Woo\u0027s November Peace\r\nInitiative on a Non-Nuclear Korean Peninsula, the South and the North of Korea\r\nreached a historic agreement in the form of the Joint Declaration on the\r\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. This inter-Korean agreement marked\r\na first step forward towards attaining non-proliferation of nuclear weapons on\r\nthe peninsula and promoting a new order of peace and stability in North-East\r\nAsia. Notwithstanding this encouraging development, the suspicions and\r\nconcerns surrounding North Korea\u0027s nuclear-development programme remain.\r\nAt the multilateral level, despite a visit by the Director General to the\r\nDemocratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea, and despite three lAEA inspections of\r\nNorth Korea\u0027s nuclear installations and materials over the past five months,\r\nwhat has transpired so far does not provide sufficient evidence to remove\r\nsuspicions about North Korea\u0027s nuclear programme.\r\nAt the bilateral level, the South-North Joint Nuclear Control Commission,\r\nat its ninth meeting in Panmunjom, which ended just this morning, failed to\r\nproduce agreement on the mutual inspection regime based on the principles of\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n82\r\n(Mr. Lee, Republic of Korea)\r\nreciprocity and challenge inspection. Thus~ the contention of the Democratic\r\nPeople\u0027s Republic of Korea that it has neither the will nor the capability to\r\nbuild nuclear weapons has yet to be verified at the multilateral and bilateral\r\nlevels.\r\nDuring both the Board of Governors meeting last month and the IAEA\r\nGeneral Conference that followed, representatives of more than 20 Member\r\nStates expressed serious concern about North Korea\u0027s still-unverified nuclear\r\nprogramme. They urged the authorities of the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of\r\nKorea to continue to be cooperative with respect to IAEA inspections and to\r\nagree to comprehensive reciprocal-inspection measures with a view to\r\nimplementing the. North-South agreement on denuclearization as soon as\r\npossible. In this connection, my delegation once again calls upon the\r\nDemocratic People\u0027s RepQblic of Korea to refrain from building or operating\r\nreprocessing-related facilities, in full compliance with the Joint Declaration\r\non the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The earlier remarks of the\r\nrepresentative of the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea concerning the\r\ncauses of the stalemate in the South-North nuclear negotiations do not deserve\r\nany comment from me or the. attention of the General Assembly as th9Y contained\r\nnot a single new, constructive or practical element.\r\nAllow me to turn to the question of nuclear safety and the safe disposal\r\nof radioactive waste, which comprises one of the most important aspects of the\r\npromotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Although individual States\r\nare Ultimately responsible for the safety of their nuclear facilities,\r\ninternational cooperation to ensure more effective and efficient nuclear\r\nsafety is more important now than it has ever been.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n83\r\n(Mr. Lee, Republic ef Korea)\r\nWhile appreciating the various initiatives of the lAEA secret~riat in\r\nthis regard, my delegation urges the Agency and the Member States cur~ently\r\nengaged in the negotiations on the draft international con~ention ~n nuclear\r\nsafety to accelerate their efforts to reach consenS~5 at the earliest possible\r\ndate - hopefully by the next session of the lAEA General Conference.\r\nWe also welcome the initiative of the Agency and tt ,lrogress that has\r\nbeen made thus far, to work out a comprehensive series of internationally\r\nagreed radioactive-waste safety standards and hope that phase I of the\r\nprogramme will be completed by 1994, as envisaged. My Government is\r\nconsidering making a financial contribution to facilitate the implementation\r\nof the programme. In this connection, as was recommended by the General\r\nConference, all States with nuclear-power development programmes are called\r\nupon to make them fully available to the lAEA with a view to enhancing\r\noperational safety. Included here are Operational Safety Review Team\r\nmissions, Assessment of Safety Significant Events Team missions and the\r\nincident reporting system.\r\nWe are increasingly concerned about the safety of nuclear-power reactors\r\nin North-East Asia, where the most extensive nuclear-power programmes are\r\nbeing developed and implemented. Recently my Gover~ent called upon the\r\ncountries in the region to give serious consideration to the establishment, in\r\nclose cooperation with the IAEA, of a regional-cooperation programme in the\r\nfield of nuclear safety.\r\nWe urge the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea to join the Regional\r\nCo-operative Agreement for Research, Development and Training Related to\r\nNuclear Science and Technology and other regional nuclear-safety cooperation\r\nprogrammes and also to mak~ use of the lAEA\u0027s services for the purpose of\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n~l\r\n{\r\nar\r\nible\r\ns\r\non\r\nd\r\nors\r\n, in\r\ne\r\n1\r\non\r\nA/47/PV.45\r\n84\r\n(Mr. Lee, Republic of Korea)\r\nupgrading the operational safety of indigenously developed nuclear reactors\r\nthat are already in operation or are under construction. Here I include the\r\nIAEA services such as those of the Operational Safety Review Team and the\r\nAssessment of Safety Significant Events Team.\r\nWith respect to the promotional aspect of the Agency\u0027s mandate, my\r\ndelegation recognizes the recent initiatives and efforts of the IAEA and of\r\nMember States to promote the peaceful application of nuclear science and\r\ntechnology for the purposes of progress in medicine, agriculture and\r\nindustry - particularly in the areas of food irradiation and portable water\r\nsupply. My delegation calls upon the Agency and other relevant specialized\r\nagencies, international organizations and non-governmental organizations to\r\nincrease their joint efforts in this respect - with particular emphasis on\r\ntechnical assistance and cooperation to meet the growing needs of the\r\ndeveloping world.\r\nIn a constantly changing world the IAEA and its member States should be\r\nable to confront emerging needs and new challenges in the promotion of the\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy. One such need is the necessity to control\r\nthe growing quantity of weapons-grade nuclear materials - plutonium and\r\nenriched uranium - separated in the nuclear cycle or recovered from dismantled\r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nIn his statement the Director General expressed concerns and made\r\nsuggestions about international measures to ensure the peaceful storage or use\r\nof fissionable material recovered during the dismantling of nuclear weapons or\r\nseparated from spent fuel and about the role that the IAEA can play in the\r\nprocess. My delegation took note of these concerns and suggestions, and we\r\nhope that the IAEA secretariat will initiate in-depth studies on this\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n8~\r\n(Mr, Lee, RQPublic of KorQa)\r\nimportant issue,vhich is qivinq rise to incroasinq international concern, and\r\nthat it vill come up vith proposals and options for consideration by the IABA\r\nand the General Assemblf in the months ahead.\r\nIn conclusion, my deleqation vishes to reiterate the commitment of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Korea to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and\r\nits full support for and cooperation with the IAEA, In this spirit, my\r\ndeleqation has become one of the sponsors of draft resolution Al47/L,9/Rev,l,\r\nWe hope that the draft resolution will be adopted by consensus.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.45\r\n86\r\nMr. GALAL (Egypt) (interpretation from Arabic): At the outset, Sir,\r\nallow me to express the satisfaction of the Egyptian delegation on the\r\nimportant statement made by Mr. Bans Blix, Director General of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in introducing the annual report of\r\nthe Agency. The tireless efforts by the Director General and the secretariat\r\nof the Agency to discharge their respective responsibilities are the subject\r\nof great satisfaction for us.\r\nMy delegation is completely satisfied with the adoption by th0 General\r\nConference of the Agency at its last session of the resolution concerning the\r\nimplementation of IAEA safeguards for the Middle East region, by consensus,\r\nfor the second year running. The reiteration of this position by the members\r\nof the General Conference supports our principled unwavering position on the\r\nnecessity of placing all nuclear installations in the Middle East under IAEA\r\ncomprehensive safeguards as an important confidence-building measure that\r\nshould make it possible to arrive at comprehensive and just solutions to the\r\nintractable political problems of the Middle East region, from which the\r\nregion has suffered for over four decades.\r\nThe IAEA plays an important role in promoting the system of\r\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons. This role is recognized as a\r\nfait accompli both at the international and the regional levels. It is also\r\nan essent 11 instrument of international movement towards the elimination of\r\nweapons of mass destruction that threaten not only the Middle East region, but\r\nthe very future of humanity the world over, and which affects most adversely\r\nthe aspirations of all peoples after security and stability.\r\nProceeding from this, Egypt welcomes the constructive steps taken by the\r\nAgency recently with a view to ridding the safeguards regime and monitoring\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.45\r\n87\r\n(Mr, %a1a1, Egypt)\r\nsystem of certain shortcomings and ensuring the implementation of the\r\nobligations under the non-proliferation Treaty.\r\nThe fact that the Agency has taken such steps attests to the flexibility\r\nof its system and its ability to keep pace with the many international changes\r\nthat have become the predominant features of our period. These measures\r\nstrengthen our confidence in the ability of the Agency to discharge it~\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nThe adherence and commitment to the non-proliferation Treaty by most\r\nmembers of the international community is such that statements have been made\r\nin the General Assembly requesting the extension of the duration of the Treaty\r\nas an urgent need, in order to spare the world the grave dangers posed by the\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. This\r\nprompts us to ask the international community to rise with the same degree of\r\ncommitment and deal with the failure of achieving the universality of the\r\nTreaty despite the 25 years that have passed since it entered into force. The\r\ncredibility of the measures adopted by the Agency to tighten the safeguards\r\nregime and monitoring system would be of limited scope so long as there are\r\nStates that act at will outside the provisions of the non-proliferation Treaty.\r\nIn this context, the context of regional disarmament, ons must stress the\r\nimportance of the accession by all the States of the Middle East~ without\r\nexception to the non-proliferation Treaty or the IAEA safeguards system, since\r\nt\r\nthis, in our estimation, is the best way to dissipate the sense of danger and\r\ninsecurity that still hovers over the region, obstructs the peace efforts and\r\nmakes every attempt at moving forward fall short of expectations.\r\nThe use of nuclear power for peaceful purposes is among the legitimate\r\nobjectives of every country of the world, particularly the developing\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n88\r\n(Mr. Galal. Egypt)\r\ncountries that could find therein the appropriate means to improve their\r\neconomies, catch up with the world\u0027s economic growth and ensure the well-being\r\nof their peoples.\r\nBefore concluding my statement, I should like to commend the lAEA\u0027s\r\nactivities in providing technical assistance to developing countries in the\r\nuse of nuclear power for peaceful purposes. We sincerely hope that this\r\npositive cooperation will continue in line with the legitimate requirements of\r\nthis group of countries.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I shall now call on those representatives who wish\r\nto explain their votes or positions before the votin~. May I remind\r\ndelegations that, in accordance with General Assembly decision ~4/401,\r\nexplanations of vote ara limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations fram their seats.\r\nMr. MALIK (Iraq) (interpretation from Arabic): The deleqation of\r\nthe Republic of Iraq would like to explain its vote on the draft resolution\r\ncontained in doc,xment A/47/L.9/Rev.l. First, Iraq is very keen not to\r\npoliticize the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) or af any\r\nother United Nations agency.\r\nSecondly, the eighth preambular paragraph and operative paragraph 6 of\r\nthe draft resolution are an unnecessary insertion in the draft by a limited\r\nand well-known number of Western countries with a view to singling out Iraq\r\nand making it appear to be a violator of the international resolutions and\r\nagreements. As I explained to you in detail in my statement a short while\r\nago, we have carried out our obligations vis-a-vis the provisions of Security\r\nCouncil reSOlution 687 (1991) in the nuclear field. You have undoubtedly\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nlV47/PV.45\r\n89-90\r\n(Mr. MaUk, Irag)\r\nnoticed tha~ the Director General of the Agency, Mr. Bliz, did not complain\r\nabout My failure on our part to implement these provisions. But. the aim of\r\nsome Western countries has been to exploit this topic among others, for\r\npolitical ends which include the continuation of the inhuman blockade imposed\r\non tha IraC!i people in order to starve them.\r\nThirdly, we in Iraq are against the use of double standards in dealings\r\nwith countries, a viewpoint which is shared by\u0027 a large number of countries.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nW41/PV.45\r\n91\r\n(Mr. Malik, Irag)\r\nIt would indeed be qood to have one single agreed standard that is\r\napplied to all countries without exception. Doubtless., -representatives have\r\nnoted that the decisions by the General Conference of the IAEA this year\r\ncontain no reference to the fact that Israel possesses nuclear weapons, nor to\r\nthe nuclear threat posed by Israel. Nor has there been any reference to the\r\nfact that Israel has not acceded to the non-proliferation Treaty as requested\r\nby Security Council resolution 487 (1981).\r\nAre not these double standards? Is this not discrimination?\r\nFor those reasons, the delegation of Iraq finds it extremely difficul.t to\r\naccept the preambular paragraph 8 and the operative paragraph 6 of the draft\r\nresolution.\r\nOn this occasion I should like to express my personal appreciation to\r\nAmbassador Paul O\u0027Sullivan of Australia for his spirit of cooperation in\r\ndiscussing this draft resolution.\r\nMr. ODEH (Jordan) (interpretation from Arabic): Before the vote on\r\ndraft resolution A/47/L.9/Rev.l, on the report of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), my delegation wishes to express its satisfaction at the\r\nresponsible international change reflected in this draft resolution in order\r\nto protect mankind\u0027s life and health and the safety of its environment.\r\nI am in duty bound to express my thanks to the Agency for its noble and\r\nimportant role, which it performs in the interests of all mankind. However,\r\nmy delegation regrets that the draft resolution is not balanced because in its\r\npreambular part it refers to one country of the Middle East region and fails\r\nto refer to another, Israel, which possesses a number of nuclear facilities\r\nand has not acceded to the non-proliferation Treaty to this day. Israel still\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAJ47/PV.45\r\n92\r\n(Mr. Odeh, Jordan)\r\nrefuses to place its nuclear facilities under the Agency\u0027s safeguards, which\r\nruns counter to the international reorientation I have r~ferred to.\r\nI should like to draw attention to paragraph 14 ef Security Council\r\nresolution 687 (1991), which stipulates that measures to be taken in\r\naccordance with that resolution represent, inter alia, steps towards the goal\r\nof ridding the Middle East of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nTherefore the least we expect of the draft resolution now before us,\r\nwhich refers to a certain country in our region, is that it should refer also\r\nto the other country. Reason might accept discrimination between one country\r\nand another that possess nuclear weapons according to their political regimes\r\nand their ability to control their nuclear weapons. But reason does not\r\naccept discrimination between countries possessing nuclear facilities in tf!rms\r\nof the danger emanating from refusal to place those facilities under the\r\nsafeguards and control of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Leakage of\r\nnuclear radiation in a givan country has nothing to do with its political\r\nregime. The danger to mankind and its environment that might result from\r\nradiation has nothing to do with the source of that danger.\r\nThus my delegation cannot feel completely satisfied with a draft\r\nresolution that ignores the Iraeli nuclear facilities - one of which is but\r\n20 miles distant from population centres in Jordan - particularly when the\r\nChernobyl disaster is still vivid in our minds.\r\nFor those reasons my delegation is obliged to abstain in the vote on the\r\ndraft resolution now under consideration, even though we appreciate the\r\nefforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency and its good faith with\r\nregard to the protection of mankind, its health and its environment.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.45\r\n93\r\nMr. AL-HADDAP (Yemen) (interpretation from Arabic): I wish to\r\nexpress deepest thanks to the Director General of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) for the extremely useful statement w~ heard yesterday\r\nhere in the Assembly.\r\nMy delegation has studied the Agency\u0027s annual report for 1991. My\r\ncountry deeply appreciates the efforts of Mr. Hans Blix and his colleagues.\r\nWe agree that it is necessary to increase the peaceful uses of nuclear energy\r\nin all areas of development.\r\nMy delegation was hoping to be able to support the draft resolution in\r\ndocument A/47/L.9/Rev.1. However, it feels that all resolutions must be\r\nbalanced and non-discriminatory. That is why we are obliged to abstain in the\r\nvote on that draft resolution. Israel\u0027s nuclear installations are not\r\nmentioned in it, and that is true of other subjects treated in the draft\r\nresolution.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I should like to announce that the following\r\ncountries have become sponsors of draft resolution A/47/L.9/Rev.1: Estonia,\r\nLithuania, Samoa and Togo.\r\nThe Assembly wil now take a decision on draft resolution A/47/L.9/Rev.1.\r\nSeparate votes have been requested on the eighth preambular paragraph and\r\nthe sixth paragraph of that draft resolution. Is there any objection to that\r\nrequest? It appears not. I shall therefore put those paragraphs to the vote\r\nfirst.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on the eighth preambular paragraph\r\nof draft reSOlution A/47/L.9/Rev.I.

May I remind delegations that, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, explanations of vote are limited to 10\r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. SALAS (Mexico)(interpretation from Spanish): The delegation of\r\nMexico voted in favour of draft resolution A/47/L.9/Rev.l because we consider\r\nthat it is of the utmost importance to support the work of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and reaffirm our confidence in the role the IAEA\r\nplays in promoting the peaceful use of atomic energy. As we all know, the\r\nGeneral Assembly for many years sought to express the international\r\ncommunity\u0027s support for the IAEA\u0027s work without singling out any of its\r\nactivities. While we support the intent of paragraphs 4 and 5, we feel that\r\ntheir inclusion for the first time in the resolution is not necessary,\r\nparticularly in the light of the last preambular paragraph, which refers to\r\nspecific decisions of the Agency. We are concerned about the trend to cite\r\nisolated decisions of the General Conference and make special reference to\r\nthem in General Assembly resolutions.\r\nSimilarly, our abstention in the separate votes on the eighth preambular\r\nparagraph and operative paragraph 6 reflect our reservations about the\r\npractice of singling out certain practices of the Agency, however important\r\nthey may be. This type of selectivity undermines the delicate balance that\r\nshould exist in the work of the Agency. It does so to the detriment of the\r\nimportance attached to other activities, such as those concerning the IAEA\u0027s\r\ntechnical cooperation.\r\nThe delegation of Mexico regrets the fact that at a time when a growing\r\nnumber of resolutions are being adopted by consensus in the Assembly, on this\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nW47/PV.45\r\n99-100\r\n(Mr. Salas, Mexico)\r\nsubject we are moving backwards. This is of no benofit to the General\r\nAssembly.or the IAEA. We hope that this situation will not recur in the\r\nfuture.\r\nMr. HUJICA CANTELAR (Cuba)(interpretation from Spanish): The\r\ndelegation of Cuba wishes to explain its position on draft resolution\r\nA/47/L.9/Rev.l concerning the report of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA).\r\nIn general, the resolution we have just adopted contains a set of ideas\r\nconcerning the work of the IAEA which our country fully endorses, because of\r\nthe importance Cuba attaches to the work of the Agency, with which we have had\r\nfruitful cooperation in the framework of current programmes for the use of\r\nnuclear energy and technology for peaceful purposes for the country\u0027s\r\neconomic, social and scientific development. Accordingly, my delegation\r\nwelcomes the resolution\u0027s positive tone concerning the strengthening of the\r\nlAEA\u0027s technical cooperation, which is so important for developing countries.\r\nHowever, the delegation of Cuba cannot support some of the references\r\nwhich appear in the resolution, references which led it to abstain in the vote\r\non those paragraphs. In particular, my delegation wishes to state its\r\nreservations concerning the endorsement in operative paragraph 6 of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 687 (1991). Cuba had an opportunity to state its reasons\r\nfor voting against that resolution as a non-permanent member of the Council\r\nwhen the resolution was adopted; those reasons are still valid, and therefore\r\nwe could not vote for that paragraph.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl41/PV.45\r\n101\r\n(Mr. Mujica Cantelar. Cuba)\r\nFor these reasons, in my Clelegat!)n\u0027s opinion, the resolution lacks the\r\nnecessary balance. As a result, despite the fact that we endorse many of the\r\nelements it contains, we considered it necessary to abstain.\r\nMr. HASSAN (Sudan): My delegation has just abstained in the vote on\r\ndraft resolution A/47/L.9/Rev.l for the following reasons.\r\nFirstly, though this draft resolution contains some positive and\r\nconstructive paragrr}.\u0027t-:;s, bo.th in the preambular and operati\u0027T~ parts, my\r\ndGlegation still finds it unbalanced, because there is no mention at all of\r\nIsrael\u0027s nuclear capabilities or its non-adherence to the non-proliferation\r\nTreaty and the safeguards systems. A draft resolution of such paramount\r\nimportance should be comprehensive, non-discriminatory, balanced, and\r\nimpartial. Unfortunately, this is not the case with draft resolution\r\nA.47/L.9/Rev.l.,\r\nSecondly, the draft resolution refers in two paragraphs to Iraq\u0027s\r\nnon-compliance ~ith its safeguards and non-prolife~ationobligations. To our\r\nunderstanding and knowledge, Iraq has accepted Security Council resolution\r\n687 (1991) and is in compliance with its implementation.\r\nA draft resolution on the report of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency should not be politicized and should be very objective. Unfortunately,\r\nthis is not the case with draft resolution ~J47/L.9/Rev.1. For these reasons,\r\nmy delegation abstained.\r\nMr. BAAH (Ghana): My delegation views with concern the report of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and draft resolution\r\nA/47/L.9/Rev.l, which contains ideas that Ghana endorses.\r\nThe usefulness of the development of nuclear-energy technology is of\r\ngreat impo1:tM, ~e to Ghana. However, t~.i! delegation of Ghana could not support\r\nthe eighth preambular paragraph or operative paragraph 6, on which it\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.45\r\n102\r\n(Mr. Baah. Ghana)\r\nabstained because it feels that the draft resolution is unbalanced and leaves\r\nsomething to be desired.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: I shall now call on those representatives who wish\r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that, in accordance with General Assembly decision\r\n34/401, statements i~ exercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes\r\nfor the first intervention and to five min~tes for the second and should ba\r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. KIM (Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea): With reference to\r\nthe south Korean statement, I wish to make our position clear.\r\nThe nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and the nuclear suspicion that\r\nremains unresolved stem from the deployment of United States nuclear weapons\r\nin south Korea. Therefore, fundamental to resolving the nuclear issue on the\r\nKorean peninsula are the withdrawal of United States nuclear weapons from\r\nsouth Korea, the inspection of the nuclear bases in south Korea, and the\r\nremoval of the sorious apprehensions of our nation, which has been under\r\nnuclear threat during the last 30 years.\r\nTo this end, it is urgent to adopt an agreement and regulations on\r\ninspection under the joint declaration of the denuclearization of the Korean\r\npeninsula and to inspect United States nuclear weapons and bases in south\r\nKorea. The north-south Joint Nuclear Control Committee, although it has met\r\nseveral times, has not yet adopted regulations on inspection to verify the\r\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula, nor has it carried out an inspection\r\nof the United States nuclear weapons and bases in south Korea. This is due to\r\nthe fact that the south Korean authorities are not in a position to take\r\naction to include the nuclear bases and weapons in the regu1ations on\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.45\r\n103\r\n(Mr. Kim, ~emocratic People\u0027s\r\nRepublic of Korea)\r\ninspection or to exercise its sovereign right regarding the question of the\r\nUnited States nuclear woapons and bases.\r\nIn the meeting with the south side, our side asked whether er not the\r\nUnited States nuclear weapons would be withdrawn from south Korea, but they\r\nsaid that we should refer this matter to Pentagon officials in Washington. It\r\nis most deplorable that the south Korean authorities do not have a say in the\r\npresence of nuclear weapons from l)~~r countries that are now on their own\r\nsoil\" nor can they verify the withdrawal of these nuclear weapons.\r\nAt the twenty-fourth South Korea-United States annual security meeting\r\nrecently held in Washington, the United States and south Korean authorities\r\nagreed in principle to resume next year the \"Team Splrit\" joint military\r\nexercises\" which are well known as nuclear exercises. Such provocative\r\nnuclear manoeuvres cannot hut be considered as an intentional act aimed at\r\nhampering the process of peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula and\r\nat blocking the implementation of the Declaration of the Denuclearization of\r\nthe Korean Peninsula. Judging from the fact that the \"Team Spirit\" military\r\ne~ercises were suspended before the inspection of our area by the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is all the more unjustifiable to\r\nresume them at \u0026 time when nuclear inspection is under way.\r\nIf the south Korean authorities are really concerned about the future of\r\nthe Korean peninsula and interested in realizing its denuclearization, they\r\nshould take an independent position, stand free from outside forces, and\r\nrespond as soon as possible by adopting the regulations on inspection, so that\r\nthe overall inspection of United States nuclear weapons and bases can be done\r\nas agreed upon by the north and the south.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.. 45\r\n104\r\n(Mr. Kim, Democratic People\u0027s\r\nRepublic of Korea)\r\nAs far as we are concerned, we have declared time and again that we have\r\nno nuclear weapons nor any intention or capacity to make them.. We have no\r\nneed to produce them. It is our firm intention, in line with our invariable\r\nanti-nuclear peace policy, to use nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes\r\nand not to develop nuclear weapons. The truth of the peaceful nuclear policy\r\nof our Government and the will to denuclearization have already been proved by\r\nseveral ad hoc inspections by the IAEA. After the third ad hoc inspection,\r\nthe inspection team, at its request, was given opportunities to inspect two\r\nplaces not included in the initial declaration. We do what we say, and we\r\nnever speak empty words.\r\nWe will remain loyal to our obligations to the Non-Proliferation Treaty\r\nand, with patience and sincerity, make every possible effort to implement the\r\nJoint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\r\nMr. LEE (Repriblic of Korea): I thank you, Mr. President, for\r\nallowing me to speak at this late hour in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMy delegation listened carefully to the usual remarks made by the\r\npreceding speaker in the expectation of finding some new, constructive or\r\npracticable elements which deserved my comment. Having failed to do so, I see\r\nno need to make further comments on his remarks, even for the sake of the\r\nrecord.\r\nTh? PRESIDENT: May I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to\r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 141\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meetinq rose at 6.45 p.m.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n"
