This leads tQ the cQnclusion that the\r\ncQntents ot the repQrt represent a world trend that has the potential Qf\r\ncrystallizing and becQming, in time, a general international apprQach,\r\nMy delegatiQn agrees with the Secretary-General that, with the end Qf the\r\nCQld war, the wQrld has reg~ined a valuable QppQrtunity tQ achieve the great\r\nQbjectives of the United Nations Charter and that such an Qpportunity shQuld\r\nnever be squandered like Qther previQus oppQrtunities that were lost because\r\nthe CQld war had paralysed the United Nations and weakened it. PrQceeding\r\nfrQm this, my delegatiQn takes pleasure in participating in this discussion.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.46\r\n6\r\n(Mr. AbU Od~), Jordan)\r\nAlthough the \u003doncept of prevent~ve diplomacy is ~ot new to the United\r\nNations, it has been creatively developed in the report at the levels of\r\ntheory and practice. While preventive diplomacy meant, ~hen it first emerged\r\nat the end of the first decade after the establishment of the Organization,\r\nintervention by the Organization in areas of conflict to fill the vacuum and\r\nprevent intervention by any of t~e Powers of the then rival camps, it now\r\nmeans, as defined in the Secretary-Generalis report the easing of tensions\r\nbefore they turn into conflicts, the prevention of aisputes amongst countries\r\nand the prevention of the escalation of disputes into art.led conflicts once\r\nthey arise. Thus, preventive diplomacy is more effective and less ~ostly than\r\nthe other means available to the Organization to intervene in conflicts,\r\ninclUding peace-keeping operations.\r\nMy delegation agrees with the Secretary-General that it is important to\r\ntake all possible measures with the aim of confidence building between the\r\nparties to the conflict, including the exchange of information on armaments in\r\norde\u003d to stem arms proliferation, particularly weapons of mass destruction, in\r\nareas of potential conflict.\r\nFurthermore, Jordan supports the need to enhance the Secretary-Generalis\r\nrole in taking the initiative, when sensing any disputes that may threaten\r\ninternational peace and security, by alerting the Security Council, in order\r\nto send in fact-finding missions in line with Article 99 of the Charter as\r\ntime is of the essence in enabling the United Nations to take the necessary\r\nmeasures to reduce tension and to de-escalate and defuse conflicts.\r\nMy delegation also supports making available to the Secretary-General the\r\nnecessary technical financidl resources for the fact-finding missions using\r\nall the facilities made available by the parties to the conflict.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n\"\r\nA147/PV.46\r\n7\r\n(Mr. Abu Odeh, Jordan)\r\nJordan believes that early warning is very important in monitoring\r\ndisputes that could escalate into armed conflict and is a very necessary\r\nco~structive idea if we want the United Nations to prevent the eruption of\r\narmed conflicts.\r\nThe responsibility of Member States as we see it is not confined to\r\nmaking available the resources necessary for United Nations intervention but\r\nalso includes the responsibility stipulated in Article 35 of the Charter which\r\nmakes it incumbent on Member States to bring to the attention of the Security\r\nCouncil any dispute in any region that may degenerate into a conflict and\r\nthereby threaten international peace and security.\r\nThere is no doubt that reluctance on the part of Member States to do that\r\nlimits the efficacy of the United Nations role. The responsibility of early\r\nwarning is the collective responsibility of the Secretary-General, the\r\nSecu~ity Council and the Member States.\r\nThe peacemaking process mentioned in the report means the prevention and\r\nremoval of future disputesthrouqh reconciliation between the parties by\r\npeaceful means. This could be attained through SQch means as are suggested in\r\nChapter VI of the Charter.\r\nWe believe that this is a sound approach and support it, assuming that it\r\nmust also apply to existing and chronic regional and international conflicts\r\nsince failure to resolve su~h conflicts will threaten international peace and\r\nsecurity as well as the very credibility of the United Nations.\r\nWe should like to stress in this respect that recourse to the provisions\r\nof Chapter VI of the Charter and the machinery stipulated therein for the\r\ns~ttlement of disputes is nJt optional to the parties to a dispute, but a\r\nduty. Member States should adhere to those provisions and thereby uphold the\r\nCharter and enhance the credibility of the Organization. By so doing, Member\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.46\r\n8\r\n(Mr. Abu OdM, Jordan)\r\nStates would be active in maintaining international peace and security by\r\ncivilized humanitarian means in a spirit of fairness and equality.\r\nRecourse to the measures outlined in Chapter VII of the Charter should be\r\na last resort, after all other peaceful means have been eZbausted.\r\nLike the framers of the Charter, we recoqnize the seriousness,\r\nsensitivity and cost of having recourse to the provisions of Chapter VII to\r\nachieve peace. Therefore, my delegation would emphasize strongly the need not\r\nto side-step Articles 33, 36, 37 and 38 of Chapter VI of the Charter which\r\nconstitute the proper approach for the peaceful settlement of disputes. The\r\napplication of the provisions ef those articles meticulously and in good faith\r\nshould be a iegal and humanitarian precondition of applying the provisions of\r\nChapter VII of the Charter.\r\nThe decision to use force ~s provided for in Article 42 of Chapter VII\r\nmust be made by the Security Council which should determine, with the\r\n. ~\r\nassistance of the Military Staff Committee, the strength of the participating\r\ncontingents and the plans for military action in accordance with Articles 4S\r\nand 46 of th6 Charter.\r\nThe peacemaking process should not be the preserve of the Security\r\nCouncil alone, nor of any principal organ of the United Nations\r\nindependentally. Any peace process must be conducted jointly by the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Ass~mbly through which the democratic character of the\r\nUnited Nations is assure4.\r\nThe enchancement of tha United Nations role in the area of international\r\npeace and security requires the strengthening of all United Nations organs,\r\nespecially the General Assembly with its universal character and important\r\nrole in the peacemaking process referred to in many of the articles of the\r\nCharter.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nW471PV.46\r\n9\r\n(Mr. Abu OdP. Jordan)\r\nRecourse to the International Court of Justice should be encouraged also\r\nin cases involving issues and disputes on which the Court can give an opinion\r\nas explained in Article 36 of the Statute of the Court, especially since\r\nArticle 94 of the Charter provides that each Member of the United Nations\r\nundertakes to comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice\r\nin any case to which it is a party.\r\nMy delegation supports the proposals made by the Secretary-General in \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\" to activa:e the International Court of Justice.\r\nc\r\nImposing sanctions on a State as provided for in Article 41 is done with\r\nthe aim of 8chi@ving peace. Implementing such sanctions is entrusted to all\r\nMember States. This creates economic difficulties for some States, especially\r\nthose which havo close economic and trade ties with the country against which\r\nsanctions are applied.\r\nTherefore, compliance ~y such States with resolutions impo~ing embargoes\r\nis tantamount to penalizing them unle~s those problems are resolved in\r\naccordance with Article 50 of the Charter. In order ~o achieve that goal,\r\nsuitable machinery must be found to implement that Article with the speed and\r\nefficiency required to avoid causing damage to the affected countries.\r\nThe idea of establishi~g peace enforcement units in the context of the\r\nAgenda seems to be in harmony with the role required of the United Nations in\r\ncertain situations where the nature of the event is beyond the capabilities of\r\nthe peace-keeping forces. ~y delegation wishes to emphasize in this regard\r\nthe necessity for such forcas to act under the terms of Article 41 of the\r\nCharter.\r\nSince its inception, ~~e United Nations bas played an important role in\r\nbringing hostilities to an lod and in the easing of tension in a number of\r\nhotbeds of conflict in the world through the use of its peace-keeping forces.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.46\r\n10\r\n(Mr. Abu Odeh, Jordan)\r\nAlthough the deployment of such forces does not constitute a solution to the\r\nproblem, their presence makes a positive contribution to defusing the\r\nsituation and creating a quieter atmosphere conducive to movement towards\r\npeace.\r\nA salient proof of the success of peace-keeping operations and the\r\nconfidence placed in them by the world is the fact that there has been an\r\nincreased demand for them all over the world, especially in recent years as\r\nshown in the Secretary-General\u0027s report.\r\nThis expanded use of ~e peace-keeping forces of the United Nations\r\nindicates that their role will remain important for a long time to come.\r\nHence, the need to develop this unique innovation of the United Nations so\r\nthat it k~ay move from the stage of being used in isolated cases into the stage\r\nof becoming a part of the military dogma of the armed forces of the various\r\nMember States.\r\nIn order for us to reach such a stage, my delegation deems it necessary\r\nto start creating the appropriate nucleus. In order to do so, we propose the\r\nfollowing: First, that symposia be organized to bring ~ogether the Chiefs of\r\nStaff of the armed forces taking part in all United Nations operations with a\r\nview to learning the lessons of these operations and assessing their successes\r\nand the difficulties they face and thereby arriving at firm bases for\r\nimproving the performance of such forces and developing patterns of training\r\nand preparation for participation in approved operations. The participating\r\nStates should have the requIred preparedness and equipment to participate\r\npromptly and effectively in such operations if and when the need arises.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.46\r\n11\r\n(Mr, Abu Odehe Jordan)\r\nSecondly, that consideration be given to the possibility of\r\nparticipation by forces of contributing countries in periodical joint\r\nexercises. This would facilitate cooperation among them in the future and\r\ninfuse them with the esprit de corps when called upon.\r\nThirdly, that Member States which have the required technical\r\ncapability, including means of transportation, should contribute part\r\nthereof and keep it in a state of readiness at all times so that the\r\nUnited Nations may readily and promptly avail itself of such contribution\r\nand thereby save the time that is wasted usually in searching for the\r\nrequired logistical support.\r\nMaking peace-keeping operations part of the military dogma of the\r\narmies of States Members of the United Nations is undoubtedly extremely\r\nimportant, not only at the military level but also at the level of\r\ncreating and developing sentiments of peace and confidence amongst those\r\nStates and their peoples.\r\nMy country, which is proud of contributing a substantial number of\r\nits military personnel and civilian police to a number of peace-keeping\r\noperations, is very happy to announce its readiness always to respond\r\npositively, within its means, to any further requests by the United\r\nNations in this regard.\r\nThe Charter devoted Chapter VIII to regional arrangements or\r\nagencies. The nature and mandates of such agencies vaxy from one region\r\nto the other. Excluding the alliances of a purely military nature,\r\nregional groupings are usually based on cooperation in the economic and\r\nsocial fields and on collective security. These are the agencies that\r\ncould play a role in discharging the tasks enumerated in \"An Agenca for\r\nPeace\".\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.46\r\n12\r\n(Mr. Abu Odeh, Jordan)\r\nAlthough there are cases where such organizations have been successful,\r\ne~pecially in recent times, as indicated in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General, they were often, and for so many years, unable to make a\r\nserious contribution to the maintenance of peace and security in the regions\r\nor to the resolution of outstanding disputes.\r\nI need not enumerate here the situations that arise in our region, where\r\nthe relevant organizations failed to discharge their responsibilities, whether\r\nin preventive diplomacy or in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means, or\r\neven in peace-keeping and peace-building operations. This, in fact, applies\r\nto the UnitEJd Nations also. If we look for the reasons behind this, we find\r\nthat most important among them is the lack of ag~eement by parties to a\r\ndispute or members of an organization to have recourse to their organization\r\nor to accept it as a body that can contribute to finding \u0026 solution to the\r\nproblem. This is one aspect of the question.\r\nThe other aspect lies in our understanding of the nature of the\r\nrelationship between such organizations and the United Nations, particularly\r\nthe Security Couucil. It is true that the Security Council has primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security world\r\nwide. However, this does not preclude regional organizations front playing an\r\neffective and pioneering role in this respect. Indeed we see a necessity for\r\nencouraging such organizations to take the initiative to solve disputes in\r\ncoordination with the Security Council and in conformity with Chapters VI\r\nand VIII of the Charter.\r\nMy country feels that the League of Arab States, as a regional\r\norganization, can play a constructive role in supporting the objectives and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations. This requires, in our opinion, intensive\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.46\r\n13\r\n(Mr. Abu Odeh. Jordan)\r\nand extensive consultations between representatives of the secretariats of the\r\ntwo organizations.\r\nThe third aspect concerns the role within the Security Council of\r\ninterregional organizations and movements, such as the Movement of Non-Aliqned\r\nCountries. First of all, we have to admit that member States of the Security\r\nCouncil, permanent and non-permanent alike, must reflect the collective\r\nposition of the States Members of the United Nations and distance themselves\r\nas far as possible from pursuing their own interests or imposing their own\r\nviews.\r\nJordan believes that the member States of the Non-Aliqned Movement are\r\nwell-equipped to play a positive role within the Security Council and within\r\nthe Un!\u0027 ;d Nations system as a whole. Other States ano groups of States,\r\nparticularly the permanent members of the Security Council, must view this\r\nrole with a qreater degree of understanding. Jordan also believes that the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council needs to be reviewed so that it may become\r\nmore representative ano thereby reflect existing international realities,\r\npromote confidence in the United Nations and in its democratic nature, and\r\nthus discharge the major tasks enumerated in the report.\r\nMoney is the prerequisite of the success of the plan embodied in the\r\n\"Agenda for Peace\". The Secretary-General\u0027s report reminCis us of the\r\nfinancial situation of the United Nations. Arrears of States from their\r\nassessad contributions reached $908.5 million in September 1992. Arrears due\r\nfor peace-keeping operations durin~ the same period were $814.4 million. This\r\nis a most serious matter, especially with regard to its negative impact on the\r\nability to achieve the desired goals and to implement the relevant\r\nprogrammes. It also makes it difficult to plan for the long term, or even to\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/471PV.46\r\n14\r\n(Mr. Abu 90eh. JQrdan)\r\nmeet immediate needs Qr tQ undertake urqently needed activities, such as\r\npeace-keeping QperatiQns.\r\nIt is therefQre imperative tQ address the financial crisis, which is due\r\nin large part to nQn-payment by SQme States, especially the larger\r\ncontributors, Qf their full assessment on time.\r\nJQrdan, which has always paid its cQntributiQns Qn time and in full,\r\ncQncu~s with the prQpQsals Qf the Secretary-General in the area Qf finance, in\r\nparticular those calling for renewable and predictable ~esources.\r\nThe Secretary-General was right when he stressed in \"An Agenda fQr Peace\"\r\nthe necessity for dealinq in a wider sense with the rQQt causes of cQnflict,\r\nwhich he summarized as eCQnQmic frustratiQn, sQcial injustice and pQlitical\r\nQppression. The aqenda, hQwever, though it analyses in detail the ways and\r\nmeans Qf consolidating peace, which analysis cQnstituted, tQgether with the\r\nrecQmmendatiQns and prQpQsals of the Secretary-General, the bulk Qf the\r\nreport, made a passing reference only to the three deep causes Qf cQnflict\r\nwhose interdependence (which may ba summed up in the one word: development)\r\nis quite clear to all.\r\nTherefQre, my cQuntry deems it necessary tQ start drawing up a plan fQr\r\ndevelQpment that would cQmplement \"An Agenda fQr Peace\" and make it an\r\nintegrated global effort.\r\nTalking of \"An Agenda for Peace\" will naturally lead us to pay attention\r\nto the future. My country\u0027s delegation wishes in this regard to warn that\r\npaying attention to the future does not mean ignoring the problems that we\r\nhave lived with throughout the past era, and with which we continue to live,\r\nnamely, the problems of debt, poverty and disease which, like chrQnic\r\ncQnflict~, liks the questiQ1 of Palestine and like the Middle E\u0026st cQnflict,\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.46\r\n15\r\n(Mr. Abu Odeh, JprdM)\r\nstill weigh hea~ily on our shoulders es we prepare to enter upon the nev era.\r\nGiving serious attention to solving these problems is a matter of great\r\nimportance.. \u002700 that they may not sap our strength, as they did in the past,\r\nand diminish our enthusiasm and readiness to contribute to building the world\r\nenvisaged in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nFinally, the world, with all its countries and peoples, is passing\r\nthrough a stage of ~ransition. The United Nations itself is no exception.\r\nTherefore, we all live in a state of dialogue, both internationally and\r\nnationally. The \"Agenda for Peace\" which we are considering is an outt.\u0027tanding\r\ncontribution that nourishes and enriches this dialogue. Therefore, my\r\ncountry\u0027s delegation supports the call for the creation of an open-ended\r\nworking group of the General Assembly to study the results of the ongoing\r\ndiscussion and to follow up in ordor to reach a consensus that would make \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\" a solid and clear framework for international action and\r\nensure a safe entry upon the new era, at the threshold of which the world now\r\nstands. A major guarantee for achieving this goal is the enhancemont of the\r\nGeneral Assembly\u0027s role and the promotion of the democratic proceos therein.\r\nThis will ensure the credibility of the United Nations and enable it to\r\nshoulder its heavy responsibilities. It is the Organization to which\r\ncountries attach their hopes and which they trust will enable th~m to live in\r\nan interdependent world of peace, security and prosperity.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nHr. GAMBABI (NAgt::ria):\r\nA/471PV.46\r\n16\r\nThe Nigerian delegation is pleased to\r\ncold war.\r\naddress the Assembly on the subject of the report of the Secretary-General\r\nentitled \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/471277). The report undoubtedly repreSl!nts\r\na significant contribution to international efforts to achieve durable peace\r\nin the post-cold-war era. Indeed, it goes a long way in the quest to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations so that it c:an effectively grapple with the new\r\nchallenges and opportunities which have become manifest since the end of the\r\ncold war.\r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s report focuses on preventive diplomacy,\r\npeacemaking and ~aace-keeping. Other aspects dwell on post-conflict\r\npeace-b\\\u0027ildinq and cooperation with regional arrangements and organizations,\r\nas well as on the financing of the United Nations. His analysis and\r\nrecommendations on these issues chart new perspectives in the ongoing efforts\r\nto revitalize the United Nations. It is therefore fitting and proper to\r\nexpress our appreciation to the Secretary-General for the thoughts that went\r\ninto the preparation of the report.\r\nThe idea and practice of preventive diplomacy emerged in the era of the\r\nEssentially, it ~as meant to isolate super-Powers from involvement\r\nin regional conflict situations so as to avoid the exacerbation of such\r\nsituations. With the end qf super-Power rivalry, the post-cold-war\r\nenvironment is most approp~iate for the full development of preventive\r\ndiplomacy and related methods for the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. We recognize that the currents of democratization sweeping through\r\nvarious parts of the world and the commitment of many States to uphold the\r\nhuman rights of their citizens contribute to this favourable environment.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.46\r\n17\r\n(Mr. Gamblri, Nigeria)\r\nAlthough the Security Council has a primary res~onsibiiity for the\r\nmai~tenance of international peace and security as provided for in Chapter VI\r\nof the Charter, particularLy in Articles 33, 34 and 36, the same Charter, in\r\nArticles 10 to 15, also assigns to t~e General Assembly a complementary role.\r\nGiven its broad representation and on the basis of our exper~ence as Chairman\r\nof the Special Committee o~ Peace-keeping Operations, my delegation believes\r\nthat the General Assembly should be an effective partner in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. The active involvement or participation of\r\nthese two organs of the United Nations in ~ha conceptualization and\r\nimplementation of proposals for preventive diplomacy, eeace-keeping and\r\npost-conflict peace-bui.lding would strengthen the capacity of our Organization\r\nto deal effectively wif:h acts of aggression involving big and small Powers\r\nalike.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the Secretary-General\"s initiatives on preventive\r\ndiplomacy throu~h the use of an early warning system, preventive deployment,\r\nand the establishment of demilitarized zones as peace buffers between warring\r\nfactions. Concepts such as preventive deplgyment, early warning systems, and\r\nthe creation of military zones are none the les6 primarily ~nilitary holding\r\nactions prior to the resolving of conflicts. Therefore, a complete peace\r\nprocess should embrace other non-military means of achieving peace, including\r\nin particular the use of political and diplomatic means. Such measures, if\r\ncarefully applied, would h~ve the advantage of cost-effectiveness in addition\r\nto being more effi~ient in ~ro-emptin9 conflict situations. We must also\r\nstress that fact-finding missions should take due cognizance of the\r\nsovereignty of the States in question. My delegation is of the view that\r\nparties to conflicts and other relevant interests should always offer maximum\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\na\r\nI\r\nl!\u0027gO,I.1 J\r\ne\r\npter VI\r\ner, in\r\ny role.\r\nbairman\r\nHeves\r\nnance of\r\nt::ion of\r\ni\r\nlization\r\nters\r\n\u0027entive\r\nllIent,\r\n\u003earring\r\ns, and\r\nding\r\nce\r\nlUdinq\r\n• if\r\nlition\r\n10\r\n,t\r\nximum\r\nA/47/PV.46\r\n18\r\n(Mr. Gambari, Nigeria)\r\ncooperation for the success of such diplomatic and peace-seeking efforts\r\nundertaken by the United Nations.\r\nThe Nigerian delegation has given serious consideration to the issue of\r\nthe preventive deployment of troops to conflict areas. We are of the view\r\nthat it is important to ensure that such deployments take full account of\r\ndomestic political circumstances and sensitivities. The United Nations should\r\navoid taking any action that could escalate conflicts and undermine the\r\nadministration of humanitarian assistance to victims.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General\u0027s assurance that such deployments:\r\n\"would not be an infringement of that State\u0027s sovereignty or be contrary\r\nto Article 2, paragraph 7, of the Charter, which refers to matters\r\nessentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State\". (A/47/277,\r\npara. 30)\r\nWe believe that there is need to ensure that adequate care is taken not to\r\ncompromise the neutrality of the United Nations.\r\nRegional arrangements were given a role in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security in the Charter. Articles 52, 53 and 54 spell\r\nout clearly what is expected of regional organizations. In 1982, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity undertook a peace-keeping mission in Chad. In\r\nWest Africa, the Economic Community of West African States has, since 1990,\r\nbeen engaged in sustained efforts to achieve peace in Liberia. At present,\r\nthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe is seized of peace\r\nefforts in Yugoslavia. All these actions are in line with the regional\r\narrangements as envisioned in the Charter and emphasized in the \"Agenda for\r\nPeace\". We welcome them.\r\nWe cannot but observe that some regional organizations are prevented by\r\ninadequate resources from effectively fulfilling the role assigned to them\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.46\r\n19\r\n(Mr. Gambari. NigeriEl)\r\nunder Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. Accordingly, the United\r\nNations should assist such regional organizations, through the provision of\r\nresources and logistical support, so as to enabl~ them to be an effective\r\npartner. of the United Nations in the maintenance of !nternational peace and\r\nsecurity. A credible role for regional organizations ;\\n the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security would alleviate the inoreasing demands on the\r\nUnited Nations and would also eubance the rapid deployment of troops to areas\r\nof conflict.\r\nNew developments in the world have expanded the scope of peace-keeping.\r\nFrom interposing United Nations troops in conflict situations with the consent\r\nof the parties in dispute, peace-keeping has come to embody such other\r\nactivities as election monitoring, humanitarian assistance, and the building\r\nof political institutions. The United Nations has therefore assumed much\r\ngreater responsibility today than ever before in the history of the\r\nOrganization. The signs are that it will continue to do so in the emerging\r\nnew world order.\r\nThe cost and bltrden of peace-keeping have been correspondingly enormous\r\nand will continue to grow. Projected estimates for ongoing peace-keeping\r\noperations for the next year is put at $3 billion. Since the United Nations\r\nwas established, its peace-keeping operations have been dogged by financial\r\ndifficulties, due in part ~o ideological conflicts and the disputed mandates\r\nof some peace-keeping operations. In this post-cold-war era, we expect Member\r\nStates seriously to seek a solution to this perennial financial problem. This\r\nwill distribute evenly the burden of peace-keeping operations, as some\r\ncountries, apart from making contributions, also have troops in the field.\r\nNot only is Nigeria a troop-contributing country, but our country has also\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.46\r\n20\r\n(Mr. Gambari. Nigeria)\r\nendeavoured to m~et its financial obligations to all United Nations\r\npeace-keeping operations. We therefore wholeheartedly support the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s recommendation for the establishment of a revolving\r\npeace-keeping reserve fund. We also appeal to all Member States to fulfil\r\ntheir financial obligation~ to ensure the success of ongoing and future\r\npeace-keeping operations to be undertaken by the United Nations.\r\nThe Nigerian delegation is concerned at the increased attacks on United\r\nNations peace-keeping personnel. Efforts should therefore be made to protect\r\nsuch personnel. Any unprovoked attack on peace-keeping personn~l should\r\nattract appropriate international sanctions.\r\nThe absence of war is not the equivalent of peace. Accordingly, while\r\nattention has rightly been devoted to curbing aggression and conflicts, other\r\nthreats to international peace and security merit serious attention if we are\r\nto build the structures of true and lasting peace. Therefore, the\r\ninternational community as a whole must urgently address the problems of\r\npoverty, the problems of economic and social development, and the problems of\r\nI\r\nenvironmental degradation - problems which threaten many countries,\r\nparticularly countries in the South.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation strongly endorses the view that the root\r\ncauses of war and the deepest sources of international tension are economic\r\ndespair, social injustice, and political oppression. A true agenda for peace\r\nmust therefore reflect as ~uch concern for non-military threats to\r\ninternational peace and security as it does for military ones. Ultimately, a\r\npeace which is not based on the dignity Qf mankind; which is not based on\r\nrespect for human rights; and which is not based on international law and\r\nequity in inter-State relations, cannot endure.\r\n,\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n-------------------\r\nMr. PASHOVSKI (Bulgaria): I would like to begin by expressing\r\nsatisfaction about the fact that the new role of the United Notions in the\r\npost-cold-war period has become a subject of thorough and extremely useful\r\ndiscussion from the very start of thi~ General Assewbly session. Indeed, we\r\nare entering a new exa, and in order to be able to respond successfully to the\r\nnew situation, it is imperative that the Organization adapt its activities to\r\nthe changing international environment. It is also very important to widen\r\nand strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and\r\nother international organizations and regional arrangemsats. The security\r\nproblems of our interdependent world could be resolved most effectively by\r\ncombining the potential of these structures to form an interlocking and\r\nmutually reinforcing system. The United Nations, as the universal body with\r\nthe widest responsibilities, is called upon to play the leading role in this\r\nnetwork of global and regional organizations.\r\nIn my statement in the general debate, I had the opportunity to voice our\r\nsupport for the thrust and the basic proposals contained in the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report, \"An Agenda for Peace\". It is a comprehensive set\r\nof ideas and specific recommendations for strengthening the Organization. It\r\nanswers the urgent need for greater focus on preventive diplomacy,\r\npeacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-building in the light of the pressing\r\nproblems we are facing today. The Bulgarian delegation will continue to be\r\nactively involved in the discussion on these issues. In my present statement\r\nI will therefore not attemp; to cover all issues of interest to this\r\ndelegation, but rather conc3ntrate on several topics.\r\nI have already stressed the importance of preventive deployment of\r\nlong-term missions in areas adjacent to regions of conflict or tension as an\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n------~-\r\nA/47/PV.46\r\n22\r\n(Mr. Pasboyski, Bulgaria)\r\neffective means to enhance confidence and stability. I did this against the\r\nbackground of the positive ezperience of implementing suCh a measure in my\r\ncountry. This example is clear proof of the validity of the ideas underlying\r\nthe proposals on preventive deployment contained in \"An Agenda for Peace\". It\r\nis our opinion that such deployment should not be viewed as limited only to\r\nmilitary presence or any pre-established format of the operation. There are\r\ndifferent circum~tances involved in each individual situation that may warrant\r\nvarying forms of preventive deployment. The form, size, composition~ duration\r\nand other modalities should be chosen to correspond to the nature of the\r\nspecific case on the basis of consultations. The missions may consist of\r\ncivilian, police or military personnel, or a combination of these.\r\nAa regards cooperation between th! United Nations and rsqional\r\narrangements, a significant potential is offered by the Conference on Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). The Helsinki Summit in July this year took\r\nvery important decisions, creating the capability of a meaningful and\r\neffective involvement of the CSCE in conflict prevention and crisis\r\nmanagement. The readiness of the partcipating States to attribute to the\r\nConference a greater role in pursuing the objectives of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations was manifest!d by the recognition of the CSCE as a regional\r\narrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII. Some of these new capabilities have\r\nalready been tested in practice. We call for the continuation of this\r\nprocess. The meeting of the Council of Ministers in Stockholm in December\r\nthis year, as the central decision-making and governing body of the CSCE,\r\npresents a valuable opportunity for follow-up of our present discussion at the\r\nregional level.\r\nI\r\nI\r\n• ...J\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n•\r\nAl47/PV.46\r\n23\r\n(Mr. Pashoyski. Bulgari~)\r\nAn essential factor for the effectiveness of the mandatory actions under\r\nArticle 41 of the Charter is their strict observance. Recent United Nations\r\nexperience has clearly shown that in order to achi~ve the desired effect the\r\nimposition of sanctions should be regarded as a comprehensive operation. All\r\naspects should be carefully studied and assessed in advanc8 6 possibly within\r\nan integrated operating budget providing for the covering of all necessary\r\nexpenditures~ Such a budget may incorporate the deployment, upon invitation\r\nby Governments, of sanctions assistance missions. A set of measures should\r\nalso be devimed, involving the financial institutions and other components of\r\nthe United Nations system, to help Member States to alleviate the economic\r\nburdens reSUlting from the observance of sanctions.\r\nWe share the concerns about the existing financial difficulties of the\r\nOrganization, especially with regard to its peace-keeping capacity. We\r\ntherefore commend the proposal of the Secretary-General to establish a\r\nrevolving peace-keeping reS3rve fund to meet the initial expenses of United\r\nNations operations pending receipt of assessed contributions. An arrangement\r\nfor alloc~tinq a fixed percentage of Member States\u0027 defence budgets for\r\nfinancing United Nations peace-keeping activities would present an appropriate\r\nand sound solution. ~here is ~ strong rationale behind such an arrangement,\r\nfor it is unquestionable that United Nations peace-keeping constitutes a\r\nsignificant contribution to national efforts to achieve security and\r\nstability.\r\nThe lint between international peace, security and stabi:lity, on the one\r\nhand, and the respect and p:omotion of human rights, OD the other, ls gaining\r\ngrowing significance. As a representative of a country that has just emerged\r\nfrom a totalitarian past, I am aware that our quest for a better world\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAJ47/PV.46\r\n24-25\r\n(Mr. Pashoyskic Bulgari~)\r\nrequires that it be built on the foundation of common values in this area.\r\nMankind will not be successful in living together in harmony if it fails to\r\nsecure compliance with basic international standards in the field of human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms. This should serve as a test, as a criterion\r\nfor each country. States should assume clear legal responsibility for their\r\ncomplian~e with the generalLy accepted standards in the field of humanitarian\r\nlaw and human rights. The instruments and mechanisms at the disposal of the\r\ninternational community should be enhanced to ensure implementation of\r\nexisting commitment3.\r\nGross violations of international humanitarian law may threaten\r\ninternational stability. Therefore, the international corronunity is in urgent\r\nneed of.creating a judicial mechanism for prosecuting the perpetrators of such\r\nacts. The creation of an international criminal court should be given serious\r\nand urge~t consideration. We also welcome Security Council resolution\r\n780 (1992), ~hich requests ~e establishment of a Commission of Experts to\r\nexamine and analyse information on violations of international humanitarian\r\nlaw in the territory of the former Yugoslavia as another important step in\r\nthis direction.\r\nBut crimes against humanity and violations of international obligations\r\nin the field of human rights should not only be punished; we should also focus\r\nour concerted effort on the prevention of such acts. Hence, there is a\r\ngrowing need for enhancing ~he capacity of the United Nations for early\r\nwarning and preventive action, as well as post-crisis amelioration of once\r\nexplosive situations.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.46\r\n26\r\n(Mr. Pa~hoysti, Bulgaria)\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General put8 forward a whole array of\r\npossibilities for preventive action and peacemakinq. In that regard, we would\r\nlike to lay upa::i31 ::trc\u0026s on the need to make full use of the I!ee%1S and\r\nmethods provided for in the Char~er for the peaceful settlement of\r\ninternational disputes. It is our conviction that Member States and the\r\nprincipal United Nations bodies should resort I\u0027IlOre fre~ently to the\r\nInternational Coert of Justice. We urge all Member States to accept the\r\ngeneral jurisdiction of the Court under Article 36 of its Statute. BUlgaria\r\nreiterates its support for the Secretary-Generalis recommendation that he be\r\nauthorized, pursuant to Article 96, paragraph 2, of the Charter, to seek\r\nadvisol~ opinioDs of the Court.\r\nWe should be aware of the need to work out, not just a list of possible\r\ninstruments, but a comprehensive system of tools for preventive diplomacy.\r\nThat system should address the various characteristics of potential conflicts\r\nand provide mechanisms for effective internatio~l efforts. It should\r\ncomprise early varninq capabilitles, confidence- and security-building\r\nmeasures, enhanced incentives for resort to the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes~ and the capacity for concerted action to contain and manage\r\nconflicts that have not been prevented and for po~t-crieis peace-building.\r\nM!:L...HAIR (Jamaica): On behalf of the member States of the\r\nCaribbea~ Community - Antiqua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize,\r\nDominica, Grenada, Guyana, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent\r\nand the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica - I wish to express our\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his reports before the General\r\nAssembly today, namely the report of the Secretary General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (Al471l); and \"An Agenda for Peace: preventive diplomacy,\r\npeacemaking and peace-keeping\" (Al47/277).\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.46\r\n27\r\n(Mrs. Mair, Jam.5!ill)\r\nThese very comprehensive and thought-provoking reports are presented at a\r\ntime when profound changes in the international political climate offer new\r\nand cornple: challenges. They also present new opportunities for effective\r\nglobal cooperation, in which the role of the United Nations is central.\r\nIn his report on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General\r\nexpresses the wish that\r\n\"a fundamental renewal of the United Nations will be complete by the time\r\nit marks its first half-century of existence\". (A/47/1, para. 7)\r\nThe Agenda for Peace, on which we shall focus our greatest at~ention,\r\ncontains many fundamental elements for such a renewal. It is in essence a\r\ncomprehensive response to the urgent, increasing demands from every region for\r\npeace, security and development. That response is informed by an expanded\r\ndefinition of security, a definition which underlines the complex sources of\r\nconflict and war. As the report states, such sources are pervasive and deep.\r\nThe member States of the Caribbean Community are pleased to note this\r\nacceptance by the Secretary-General in his report of a wider definition of\r\ninternational security which recognizes not only political and military, but\r\nalso social and economic, issues which are often the sources of political\r\nconflict. The Secretary-General acknowledges that preventive diplomacy must\r\ninclude information on econ~mic and social trends as well as political\r\ndevelopments, which lead to dangerous tensions. We therefore strongly endorse\r\nhis statement that the Organization\u0027s responsibilities and commitments in the\r\npolitical and security area should not be carried out at the expense of its\r\nresponsibilities in the dev~lopment field, and that neither should be\r\nsubordinated to the other. It is essential that they be pursued in an\r\nintegratea, mutually supporting way, utilizing the resources of both the\r\nSecurity Council and the Genera! Assembly.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47.1P\u00271.46\r\n28\r\n(Mrs. Mair, Jamaica)\r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s report, \"An Agenda for Peace\", also reinforces\r\nthe impo~t~ce of United Nations ~ooperation with regional organizations which\r\nhave the very special competence to play a strategic role in processes of\r\npreventive diplomacy as well as in peacemaking and peace-building.\r\nIn my region, Haiti presents a classic case for the United Nations to\r\ninvoke the principles and guidelines contained in the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nreport, namely applying political, social and economic indicators in\r\ndetermining the root causes of that truly tragic situation. It also requires\r\nstrengthening, through appropriate measures, the capability of the regional\r\norganization, in this instance the Organization of American States, which is\r\nseized of the problem. The active participation of the United Nations in\r\nfinding a solution to this escalating human tragedy which threatens the\r\nsecurity of the region can contribute significantly to the urgently needed\r\nprocess of national reconciliation and national reconstruction.\r\nThe member States of the Caribbean Community strongly support the thesis\r\nthat the observance of international law has to be the solid foundation of all\r\nactivities undertaken by the United Nations in the pursuance of peace and\r\nsecurity. In this context, and particularly during this Decade of\r\nInternational Law, we believe that serious consideration should be given to\r\nthe Secretary-General\u0027s rec)mmendations on the role of the International Court\r\nof Justice and on acceptance by Member States of the Court\u0027s compulsory\r\njurisdiction. We also support in principle the proposal that the\r\nSecretary-General should be authorized to seek the advisory opinion of the\r\nWorld Court in respect of issues of which he is seized. The discretionary\r\ncompetence which is implied here is consistent with and clearly supplements\r\nthe responsibility entrusted to the Secretary-General in Article 99 of the\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.46\r\n29-30\r\n(Mrs. Mair, Jamaica)\r\nCharter, which requires him to bring to the attention of the Security Council\r\nany matter which in his opinion may threaten tDs maintenance of international\r\npeace and securit~.\r\nThe report raises major budgetary implications for the effective\r\nimplementation of the Agendn for Peace. The issue of United Nationf l\u0027esources\r\nneeded for the qrowing demands of peace-keeping and peace-building is a major\r\nproblem. The resolution of that problem will require the most serious\r\nconside~ation by the United Nations. The Secretary-General suggests that\r\nMember States sho~ld look to their national defence budgets to finance such\r\nprogrammes. This, in our view, indicates the need for the United Nations\r\nsimultaneously to activate most vigorously its mandate for disarmament.\r\nThe world has put the cold war behind it, but the peace dividend has yet\r\nto be realized, and could well provide the sources for funding a peaceful and\r\nequitable new world order such as the Secretary-General has envisaged with\r\ngreat insight. Such an order demands, as an absolute imperative, a just\r\nglobal economic environment as the foundation for international peace and\r\nsecurity. We therefore share the view expressed by the Minis~er of State for\r\nExternal Affclirs of India during the recently concluded general debate that an\r\nagenda for development, so designated by the Secretary-General, is as\r\nimportant as an agenda for peace. We are also of the view that they should\r\ncomplement each other.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.46\r\n31\r\n(Mrs. Mair. Jamaica)\r\nThe el~~ration of such a world order clearly requires the participation\r\nof all the States Membera ~f the United Nations. And iu this context the role\r\nof the GSliGral Assembly is absolutely paramount. It is based on the\r\nfundamental princi~~os of the Charter which affirm the sovereign equality of\r\nall Member States that function through processes that are democratic and\r\ntransparent. Its authority in relation to all issues of the agenda of the\r\nUnited Nations is unquostioned, and we therefore welcome the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s recurring emphasis in his reports on the essential\r\nresponsibilities of the General Assembly.\r\nSo i~ this context our region supports the proposal which has been made\r\nby other Member States that this very important report \"An Agenda for Peace\"\r\nwhich is before us at this session should be the subject of analysis and\r\nfurther elaboration by an opon-ended working group of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. KHERBI (Algeria) (interpretation from French): I should like to\r\ntell you once again, Sir, hJW pleased we are that you are presiding over the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this session. I should also like to congratulate the\r\nSecretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, on the\r\nquality and comprehensiveness of his report on the work of the Organization\r\nand on his \"Agenda for Peace\". Most assuredly, these a.\u0027l:e important\r\ncontributions, which, in their scope and in their thrust, give food for\r\nthought, for discussion, for dialogue and for br~ad-based joint action with a\r\nview to strengthening our Organization and making it a more effecltiva\r\ninstrument. for serving the purposes and principles of the Cha~ter. Coming in\r\na context of far-reaching c:anges in international relations and marking the\r\nwill to adapt the United Nations to the new requirements and the challenges of\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.46\r\n32\r\n(Mr. Kherbi.. Algeria)\r\nour time, this innovat:Lve and imaginative undertaking is of genuine interest\r\nto the international cO~~U:I1.-;\u0027ty in its quest for a more just and more equitable\r\nnew order.\r\nThe quidelines and the points of reference on which the non-aligned\r\ncountries will base themselves have been set out by the representative of\r\nIndonesia, which currently holds the Chair of the Movement of Non-Aligned\r\nCountries. We agree with ~1e analysis he made and fully associate ourselves\r\nwith the proposals he made, which are the result of the process of reflection\r\non the \"Agenda for Peace\" in which the non-aligned countries have been engaged\r\nsince its publication.\r\nIn tho statement he made in the general debate on 28 Septemb\u0026r 1992, the\r\nMinister fnr External Affai\u0026s of Algeria, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, emphasized that\r\n\"this sossion of the General Assembly will be a new starting-point for\r\nthe United Nations that will place it resolutely on the path of greater\r\ndemocratization and enhance its effective~ess in promoting peace\u0026\r\ncooperation and development\". (A/47/PV.l4, p. 7)\r\nThe Assembly\u0027s consideration of \"An Agenda for Peace\" affords us a new\r\nopportunity jointly to think about the steps to be taken and the means to be\r\nused for the achievement of these objectives which will determine the future\r\nof international relations ~nd which, naturally, should in all circumstanc.es\r\nguide our collective action. This means that the democratizaticn of\r\nintornationa1 relations must take place first of all within our Organization\r\nand must constitute a guiding priority for any broad-based global action aimed\r\nat reaffirming the purposes and principles of the Charter and strengthening\r\nthe capabilities of the Uni~ed Nations in all spheres.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA!.@.,;/PV.46\r\n33-35\r\n(Mr. Kberbi, Algeria)\r\nIn this regard, strict respect for the prerogatives of the major bodies-\r\nof the United Nations should be reflected in a fair balance that highlights\r\nthe importance of the role of the General Assembly. Thus, we have noted with\r\nsatisfaction that in his annual report the Secretary-General ha~ stated that\r\nthe cornerstone of all action is the full application of the principles of\r\ndemocracy within nations and within the world Organization itself.\r\nThis commitment is obviously in line with our concerns as non-aligned\r\ndeveloping countries with regard to respect for the cardinal principles which\r\nshould underlie international relations and the activity of the United\r\nNations - namely, the sovereign equality of States, non-interference in\r\ninternal afairs, non-use of force, the peaceful settlement of disputes, the\r\nterritorial integrity of States, the right of peoples to self-determination,\r\nthe right to development, and the promotion of international cooperation.\r\nIn the same vein, we believe that the recommendations contained in \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\" are deserving of serious consideration in depth by the\r\nGeneral Assembly and its subsidiary bodies, as well as by all the other bodies\r\nand institutions of the United Nations. The proposal that the General\r\nAssembly set up an open-ended working group deserves the support of all\r\ninasmuch as it reflects the role of the General Assembly as the pre-eminent\r\ndemocratic and representative body for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.46\r\n36\r\n(Mr. Kherbi. Algeria)\r\nAlgeria vill contribute to the group\u0027s work, cooperating fUlly in an\r\nattempt to achieve positive results to the benefit of peace, cooperation and\r\nshared devalopmeut and prosperity for all.\r\nWe should like to emphasize first at this stage that security and\r\ndevelopment are indivisible. which implies that the right to development is a\r\nbasic element of any consistent approach to preventive diplomacy. He~ce we\r\nshould remember that peace and security depend as much on socio-economic\r\nconditions as on military factors.\r\nIt is also important fully to integrate into preventive diplomacy actions\r\nin the sphere of disarmament, especially nuclear disarmament, since it is\r\nclear that situations of qualitative and quantitative imbalance constitute\r\nthreats to international peace and security.\r\nFinally, it should be pointed out that it may be difficult in practice to\r\ndraw a clear distinction between preventive diplomacy and peace-keeping,\r\npeacemaking and peace-building, since the applicable measures and instruments\r\nin each situation overlap a great deal. In all of these cases we must in the\r\nfinal analysis set in motion the variety of mechanisms provided for under\r\nChapter VI of the Charter, whether to prevent a conflict, resolve it by\r\npeaceful means or avoid its recurrence.\r\nIt follows logically that the use of enforcement measures, or the use of\r\nforce, would be contemplated only after the exhaustion of all means available\r\nto the United Nations, regionu1 organizations and Member States for the\r\npeaceful settlement of disp\u0027ltes, including implementation of the relevant\r\nprovisions of Chapter VI of the Charter.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.46\r\n37\r\n(Mr. \u0027herb!. Algeria)\r\nIn this context, regional organizations and agreements have an important\r\nrole to play in the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the\r\nSGc~etary-General (A/47/277). They ~hould have the constant support of the\r\nUnited Nations in planning and carrying out preventive diplomacy or\r\npeace--keeping, peacemaking or peace-building operations. This support, which\r\nwould form part of the demo\u0027~ratizationof international relations, should be\r\nexpressed not only in political and diplomatic terms, but also in material\r\nterms, because lack of resources often affects their ability to settle\r\nregional conflicts.\r\nWith regard to peace-ktiepinq operations and proposals to extend their\r\nscope, we believe that we must define general principles and ways and means of\r\nimplementing them so as to avoid the risk of relying on such opera~ions\r\nindefinitely in the field as a substitute for a political settlement. This of\r\ncourse does not mean that we should ~et up a rigid or fixed framework that\r\nwould harm the flexibility ~r special nature of each operation; on the\r\ncontrary, we should help re31ize the objectives for which it is set up, and\r\nthe smooth carrying out of its mandate. We should also help all the bodies\r\nand parties involved - the General Assembly, the Security Council, ~be\r\nSecretary-General and the plrties directly concerned - play their role.\r\nThe financing of peace-keeping operations should continue to be the\r\ncollective responsibility of States Members. Nevertheless, the spucial\r\nresponsibilities of the permanent members of the Security Co\u0027xncil mu~t\r\nJpso facto confer upon them similar financial obligations and the current\r\nmethod of sharing the cost of peace-keeping operations should be revised to\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/471PV.46\r\n38-40\r\n(Mr. ~rbi, Algeria)\r\ntake into account the limited capacity to pay of many developing countries,\r\nespecially at a time when the-number of such operations is increasing.\r\nThe current debate testifies to the clear determination of Member States\r\nto begin a dynamic process of strengthening the United Nations. If it is\r\ncarried o~t in a methodical, rigorous, consistent and gradual manner, with a\r\nconstant view to maintaining the balance of the United Nations, an institution\r\nbuilt on sovereign equality and universality, the process may give rise to a\r\ngenuine renewal and resurgence of our Organization.\r\n...\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.46\r\n41\r\nMr. ACHARIA (Nepal): The report of the Secretary-General, \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\"r is a major contribution to discussion of the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in meeting the challenges of the post-cold-war world. My\r\ndelegation has followed with teen in~erest the thoughtful comments provoted by\r\nthis important document both in the qeneral debate and during this debate on\r\nitem 10 of our agenda. While welcoming this serious discussion, my delegation\r\nfeels that the General Assembly does well to keep in sharp focus the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s wise caution that the search for improved mechanisms and\r\ntechniques viII me~ little unless the new spirit of commonality among its\r\nmembership is backed by the viII to take the hard decisions demanded by this\r\ntime of opportunity.\r\nMy delegation strongly supports the view that acute poverty, with its\r\never-present threat of social upheavals, constitutes the fundamental\r\nnon-military challenge to security and stability. We believe that\r\ninternational cooperation in economic and social fields deserves the same\r\nsense of responsibility and urgency as the commitments to political and\r\nmilitary issues. Failure on this front will keep the Organization forever\r\ntied to the crisis-by-crisis response.\r\nMy delegation views the discussion on \"An Agenda for Peace\" as the\r\nbeginning of a process. The wide range of crucial issues of principle and\r\npolicy raised by the report need to be examined in the competent organs of the\r\nUnited Nations. With this in mind, we support the proposal to establish an\r\nopen-ended working group of the General Assembly. 1 will, therefore, limit\r\nmyself to a few issues.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl411PV.46\r\n42\r\n(Mr. Acharyac Nepal)\r\nA consenSUR is already discernible on the Secretary-General\u0027s proposals\r\non preventive diplomacy and peacemaking at an early stage. In the final\r\nanalysis, the effectiveness of these recomnlondations rests on a greater\r\nwillingness of Member States to have recourse to mechanisms under Chapter VI\r\nof the Charter. Allowing the Secretary-General the full freedom of action in\r\naccordance with the Charter, inclUding the provision of Article 99, will\r\nstrengthen the capacity of the United Nations in preventive diplomacy. An\r\nenhanced capacity for continuous gathering and analysis of reliable\r\ninformation will be indispensible if the Secretary-General is to carry out\r\nthese functions. Apart from information from Member States, the\r\nSecretary-General should be able to make full use of the United Nations system\r\naround the world. My de_~q~tion believes that giving the Secretary-General\r\nauthorization to request advisory opinions of the International Court of\r\nJustice under Article 96 would greatly enhance his capacity for quiet\r\npreventive diplomacy. An important component of the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nrecommendations is preventive deployment. My delegation feels that this\r\nmechanism could be immensely valuable in avoiding confrontation. We also\r\nagree with the proposal on the creation of demilitarized zones.\r\nThe massive human tragedy in various parts of the world, where thousands\r\nof innocent civilians are being slaughtered and subjected to unspeakable\r\nbarbarity, does call for stcong and urgent international measures to uphold\r\nthe sanctity of life and norm~ of international law. The Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nrecommendations on enforcement actions provide, within the framework of the\r\nCharter, coherent starting-points for a permanent mechanism, transcending the\r\ncrisis-by-crisis approach. It is indeed a sad commentary on human civiliza~ion\r\n4\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.46\r\n43\r\n(Mr. Aehaxya. Nepal)\r\nthat th~ use of force shoald remain the ultimate tool at the disposal of the\r\nUnited Nations. The significant political and other implications of the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s recommendations under Article 43 deserve very careful\r\nscrutiny. While this study continues in the competent organs of the United\r\nNations, my delegation strongly urges that we do not allow the focus on\r\nenforcenlent to relegate to the background the primary purpose of the United\r\nNations, which is the promotion of peaceful settlement of disputes. My\r\ndelegation fully endorses the view that, even if a consensus is reached on an\r\nenforcement mechanism, that mechanism should remain a last resort, after all\r\nother means of diplomacy, peace-keeping, peacemaking and humanitarian\r\noperations have been exhausted.\r\nNepal wholeheartedly supports the Secretary-General\u0027s thinking and his\r\nproposals on peace-keeping. Our soldiers and civilians have been serving the\r\ntJnited Nations peace-keeping missions without a break for over 25 years, and\r\nwe remain ready to respond ;0 any call. Many of our men have defended the\r\nUnited Natio~s mandate with their lives. I express our deep appreciation to\r\nthe Secretary-General for his determination to ensure the safety of United\r\nNations personnel. As a troop-contributing country of long standing, we share\r\nthe Secretary-General\u0027s mounting concern over peace-keeping finances and\r\nunreservedly support his proposals. We hold it as a matter of principle that,\r\nwhile financing of a duly con5tituted peace-keeping operation is a collective\r\nobligation, the permanent members of the Security Council bear a special\r\nresponsibility. We th\u0027·~~fore believe that institutionalization of the present\r\nsystem of assessment would ~rovide the needed stability and predictibility for\r\nthe financing of peace-keeping operations. We have noted the intention of the\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl411PV.46\r\n44-45\r\n(Mr. Acharya, Nepal)\r\ndelegation of Japan to put bofore the current session a draft resolution\r\ndealing with the financial ;:equirements for major peace-keeping operations at\r\nthe start-up ataga lUll! ~ stand ready to cooperate with them. My delegation\r\nalso supports the proposal of Japan for the establishment of a mechanism for\r\nconsultations among the permanent members of tho Security Council, the major\r\nsources of financial resources, countries providing large contingents and the\r\ncountries of the rGgions concerned.\r\nThe ongoing serious discussions on enhancing the role of the United\r\nNations cannot be delinked from the discussions on the functions of the\r\nOrganization\u0027s organs, including the composition of the Security Council. The\r\nSecretary-General has put his finger on the crux of the matter, with his\r\nobservations on democracy a~ the national levels and democracy, trust and\r\nimpartiality within the family of nations. His observations could be the\r\nframe of raference ~n our effort to ensure democracy at all levels.\r\nMr. PIRIZ-BALLQN (Uruguay) (interpretation from Spanish): First of\r\nall, we too would like to associate oursolves with the tributes paid to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report \"An Agenda for Peace\". The face of the world\r\nhas changed substantially. With the end of the cold war, prospects are\r\ndawning for turning into reality the ideals that inspired the founding of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\n•\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.46\r\n46\r\n(Mr. Piriz-Ballon, Urugugy)\r\nThe Secretary-General has seized this historic opportunity and has\r\nproposed a programme of action for the attainment of these goals. In many\r\ncasos nis proposals mean interpretinq the scope of certain fundamental\r\nprovisions of the Charter and assessing the suitability of the mechanisms\r\navailable to us for ensuring their implementation. This task has become\r\nindispensable ever since the cold war made the implementation of these\r\nprinciples and purposes unthinkable.\r\nHence we believe that the Secretary-General is using a very valid\r\nmetaphor when he warns us that we are navigating in uncharted waters. We must\r\nhelp him to chart the course, keeping as our North Star the ideals of the\r\nUnited Nations, with due emphasis on those principles that should quide us on\r\nour way and identifying the shoals that threaten our voyage.\r\nOur position with respect to the course to be taken in this quest has\r\nbeen faithfully set forth in the statement by the delegation of Argentina from\r\nthis rostrum on behalf of the members of the Rio Group. None the less I\r\nshould like to express a few thoughts that are of particular importance tr\r\nUruguay, a country which, like many other Members of the Organization, nas\r\nresolved to reconcile the appeal for action with the preservation and\r\nstrengthening of certain basic principles of our international life. We would\r\nlike to mention, among others, respect for the principle of sovereignty and\r\nthe juridical equality of States, its corollary the principle of\r\nnon-intervention, the right to self-determination, and respect for and\r\npromotion of human rights.\r\nThis reference to human rights as a whole, inevitably including economic\r\nand social rights, prompts us to mention one of our most important areas of\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.46\r\n47\r\n(Mr. Piriz-Ballon. Urugu~\u0027)\r\nco~ceptual agreement with the proposals made by the Secretary-General. I am\r\nreferring of course to the concept, based on an objective and honest analysis\r\nof ~eality, that economic and social development and international security\r\nare two sides of the same coin. As the representative of Argentina said, this\r\nintegrated approach to development and security represents a view long held by\r\nthe Latin American countries.\r\nWe believe in fact that the objective of reducing economic and social\r\nimbalances must not be interpreted solely as a premise, an unavoidable means\r\nof contributing to security there is no such syllogism of subordination. It\r\nis our understanding that d!velopment is an end in itself. Without\r\ndevelopment, security would be precarious and fragile, just as without\r\nsecurity it is illusory to think about development. That is how we interpret\r\nthe concept of an integrated approach to which the Secretary-Generalis report\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" refers. It is very important to point out that if\r\ndevelopment were not sustainable from the environmental standpoint and from\r\nthe standpoint of the management of natural resources, then both objectives\r\nwould be jeopardized.\r\nWe should also recall that for the quest for development with security\r\nand security in development to be viable these must be based on the promotion\r\nof democracy and the full e1joyment of human rights in their other\r\ndimensions: political, civil and cultural. These are also concepts included\r\nin the report of the Secretary-General. It is never superfluous to recall\r\ntheir importance.\r\nThe problems which fron a practical standpoint affect peace and security\r\ntoday are complex and variej. We often see at their root the impact of\r\n•\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.46\r\n48\r\n(Mr. Piriz-Ballon, Uruguay)\r\neconomic and social problems. But there are also other factors of an ethnic\r\nand religious nature, nationalist strife and resentments of all types,\r\nsometimes exploited by partisan personalities inBpired by spurious ambition.\r\nHence we completely agree with the Secretary-General in his proposal for\r\na realistic approach to confronting these conflicts. He rightly affirms in\r\nparagraph 113 of his report (A/47/l) that \"no two conflicts are the same\" and\r\nthat the solutio.ll \"must be approached with flexibility and creativity adapted\r\nto each particular situation\".\r\nThe picture that emerges from this type of conflict, which by its\r\nlocalized nature is no less serious and tragic from a human standpoint, is a\r\nvery disturbing one. It is clear that because of the limits imposed by the\r\nunassailably valid principle of non-intervention, nothing can take the place\r\nof the will of the parties regarding their behaviour vis-a-vis other\r\nprinciples that are certainly equally valid, such as the law of peoples,\r\njus cogens and humanitarian law.\r\nWe the peoples of the world, custodians through the United Nations of\r\nthese all-important principles must, under the provisions of the Charter,\r\nbring to bear all authorized means of pressure in order to overcome these\r\nsituations. It is infinitely preferable, from every standpoint, to prevent\r\nconflicts before they break out than to have to remedy them by using\r\npeace-keeping operations.\r\nThat is why we support the use of preventive diplomacy, which can also be\r\ndefined as the establishment of peace at an early stage and which as such can\r\nbe seen in the context of Chapter VI of the Charter.\r\nThe efforts made in tha recent turbulent months regarding missions of\r\nfact-finding and of good offices show that events are supporting the\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/471PV.46\r\n49\r\n(Mr. Piriz-Ballon. Uruguay)\r\nrecommendations made in the report and we are gratified that this is the\r\ncase. But it is necessary to strengthen further the preventive capacity of\r\nthe Unitad Nations, basically by giving the Secretary-General all the\r\ninformation that he needs in a timely manner about potential situations of\r\nconflict, and by ~roviding the Secretariat with greater resources to increase\r\nits capacity for gathering, analysing and processing this information.\r\nThe preventive deployment of troops mentioned in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General, either upon the request of the two parties or of one of\r\nthem, seems to us to be a very interesting concept. Likewise, preventive\r\ndeployment in situations of national crisis, upon the request of the parties\r\nconcerned, does not in principle pose conceptual problems for us, above all\r\nwhen much higher interests are at stake, such as the life and physical and\r\nmoral integrity of the civilian population.\r\nIn this respect we wish to express our support for the emphasis which the\r\nSecretary-General places on the peacemaking role of the Organization through\r\ndispute-settlement techniqu3s and procedures provided for in Chapter VI, which\r\nof course includes preventive diplomacy.\r\nAlthough it is obvious, it is worth reaffirming that Chapter VII is\r\napplicable only after the means provided in Chapter VI have been completely\r\nand absolutely exhausted.\r\nI should like to refer very briefly to the reco~nendation contained in\r\nparagraph 39 (a) of \"An Agenda for Peace\", on acceptance of Article 36 of the\r\nStatute of the International Court of Justice. My Government cannot fail to\r\nshare this idea since Uruguly was one of the first countries to accept the\r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of ~he Court.\r\n.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n1J47/\u0027eV.46\r\n50\r\n(Mr. Piri3-Bal10n, Uruguay)\r\nAnother aspect. to be pointed out is the emphasis placed on the need to\r\nestablish effeqtive mechani:;ms for the implementation of the provisions of\r\nArticle 50 of the Charter. In this respect my count~ enthusiastically\r\nsup~\"Orts this .initiative, which is being\u0027 qivenpriority at~ention by the\r\nSpecial Committee on the Charter••\r\n* Mr. Moumin (Comoros), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl411PV.46\r\n51\r\n(Mr. Piriz-Bal1on. Urugu~)\r\nWe should also like to emphasize the importance Uruguay attaches to\r\nmeasures aimed at protectinq the human riqhts of the civilian population in\r\ntimes of conflict, and the role the United Nationa can play in this regard.\r\nFor this reason we c.onsid~r particularly important \\the Security Council\u0027s\r\ndecision in which violations of international humanitarian law in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina are condemned and a Commission of Experts is established to gather\r\nevidence of such violations. We have always advocated the establishment of\r\nthis kind of mechanism, a position \u0027that was clearly established by our\r\nMinister in the Commission on Human Rights.\r\nUruguay has participated in peace-keeping operations for almost 40 years\r\nnow by providing observers and military contingents, police and civilian\r\nobservers in the electoral and human-~ights spheres.\r\nMy country\u0027s commitment to this mechanism arises from its conviction,\r\nwhich is profound indeed, that peace-keeping operations are an effective\r\ninstrument for collective security.\r\nAs we all know, the expansion of peacekeeping operations has reached\r\nextraordinary dimensions both quantitatively and qualitatively. This\r\nexpansion ha3 been based on observance of the cardinal principles enshrined in\r\npractice, such as the consent of the parties involved, the non-combatant role\r\nof the United Nations forces, and the impartiality and neutrality of the\r\nUnited Nations in the conflict. Tnese principles are vital in view of the\r\nnature of this kind of activity.\r\nOne of the critical factors affecting the success of these and other\r\npeace operatj,!,:~) is undoubt~(Uy the financial aspect. The financial crisis is\r\na fact, and ways and means of resolving it must be found. In this connection\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n---------------------\r\nA/471PV.46\r\n52\r\n(Mr. Piriz-Ballon. Urugua~)\r\nthe Secretary-General suggests ~ome forms of action that we believe should be\r\nstudied seriously by the Fi~th Cornmittee~\r\nNone the less we wish here and now to reaffirm my delegation\u0027s agreement\r\nwith what was stated by the Rio Group in connection with the\r\ninstitutionalization of a special scale that faithfully reflects the\r\ncollective responsibility of Member States. In our view, there is no new\r\nelement that warrants its reform. In any event, new mechanisms must be\r\nadditional to the special scale and must never replace it.\r\nChapter VIII of the report deals with questions relating to the safety of\r\npersonnel involved in United Nations peace operations. This is clearly an\r\nimportant subject - and not only for troop-con~ributingcountries such as my\r\nown. The Secreary-General proposes some interesting initiatives. We believe\r\nthey must be studied in depth.\r\nWe welcome the fact that recent Security Council resolutions reflect this\r\nconcern. We are convinced that the General Assembly also should be able to\r\ntake a specific stand in this regard.\r\nThe importance of ensuring the broadest possible protection of personnel\r\nis self-evident. Hundreds of persons, both military and civilian, have\r\nalready given their lives for the cause of peace. A few days ago, in this\r\nvery forum, the Permanent RJpresentative of the United Kingdom proposed that a\r\nmemorial be established for those who have died in the service of the\r\nUnited Nations. We completely agree with that suggestion. We believe it is\r\nonly just to pay a tribute of this type.\r\nFinally, we should like to comment on the proposal of the Rio Group that\r\na working group of the General Assembly be established to study the \"Agenda\r\nfor Peace\".\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.46\r\n53\r\n(Mr. Piriz-Ballon. Uruguay)\r\nThe Secretary-GeneralIs re~ort is addressed to all the Members of the\r\nUnited Nations. That is completely normel in view of the raftge of issues to\r\nwhich the agenda refers. It is therefore completely legitimate to have the\r\nreport considered by the General Assembly, in which all Member States are\r\nrepresented.\r\nThe report is now being studied by the Security Council within its sphere\r\nof competence. It is also being studied by six subsidiary organs of the\r\nGeneral Assembly within their respective mandates. We believe that this\r\nspecialized and compartmentalized consideration is of course necessary and\r\ndesirable, but at the same time it is, we feel, equally necessary to establish\r\nwithin the General Assembly a mechanism that allows us to have an overview,\r\nthus ensuring coordination among the subsidiary bodies and making possible a\r\nconstructive dialogue with the Security Council.\r\nMr. SQ~iAVIA (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish): This statement\r\nis made in the framework of the comments of tho deleqation of Argentina [nada\r\non behalf of the countries members of the Rio Group.\r\nThe Secretary-General has given us an imaginative doctunent. It is\r\nintellectually attractive and politically innovative. It merits our careful\r\nattention. We congratulate him and the team that prepared it. Let us give\r\nsome thought to his ideas.\r\nHe offers us \"An Agenda for Peace\". This impels us to recognize that in\r\nour time peace is not merelI the absence of conflicts and armed\r\nconfrontation. The essence of peace is justice, not force. Justice, as a\r\nsource of stability, is permanent. Force, as a source of stability, is\r\ntemporary. A powerful nati,)n is not necessarily just. A just nation is not\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAI~?!PV.4S\r\n54-55\r\n(Mr. Somavia. Chile)\r\nnecessarily powerful. When we in the United Nations speak of peace, we are\r\nspeaking of placing force in the service of justice, and justice in the\r\nservice of peace.\r\nThat is why preventive action is so important. We all know that long\r\nbefore open conflicts break out their ethnic, religious, cultural, social and\r\neconomic roots are silently striking deeper. We are well aware that wars\r\nbegin in the minds and hearts of human beings.\r\nIdentifying these situ~tions in time is a primary responsibility of the\r\nOrganization. We support all the proposals designed to strengthen the\r\nSecretary-Generales capacity to take action in an impartial, independent\r\nmanner, and in accordance with the Charter, to deal with latent conflicts in\r\ngood time.\r\nPeace must be attained above all by the instruments of peace - that is to\r\nsay, through dialogue, persuasion, good offices and the whole range of means\r\nof preventive diplomacy. It would be dangerous for the United Nations to\r\ndevelop only a military concept of peace, as it would be if at the end of the\r\nday it lacked the military capacity to enforce its decisions.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.46\r\n56\r\n(Mu Somayia, Chile)\r\nWe must never forget that the United Nations vas born to safeguard\r\npeace. This is the house of peace in the world. The main taak is to know how\r\nto safeguard peace in each specific situation. We need to devise all the\r\ninstruments of political power and negotiation that will prevent hostilities\r\nbetween two or more parties. We want the United Nations to be respected for\r\nthe strength of its presence and its ideas, rather than for its concerted\r\nmilitary-deterrence capacity. In people\u0027s minds the United Nations must be\r\nthe symbol of a great, historic undertaking of non-violence.\r\nAll of this prompts the question \"What does security in the modern age\r\ninvolve?\" The cold war has already taught us that security is not a matter of\r\naccumulating more and more destructive weapons. In modern history the 45\r\nyears of t~e arms race have produced the most colossal waste.\r\nHave we learned the lesson? It is not at all certain that we have. We\r\nmay be living through the transition from a period in which the ideological\r\nfrontiers of the cold war were used to justify the most horrible crimes to a\r\nperiod characterized by the re-emergence of religious and ethnic frontiers.\r\nAs if by a miracle, those who seek armed confrontation never lack the weapons\r\nfor their purpose.\r\nThe great challenge facing the United Nations is to contribute to the\r\ndevelopment, promotion and strengthening of a culture of peace. This is the\r\nOrganization\u0027s basic preventive task. It is undoubtedly necessary that, in\r\nspecific circumstances, the United Nations be given its own capacity for\r\nmilitary intervention. This has been demonstrated by the Gulf war, by the\r\nsituation in Cambodia and by the traqic situation in the republics of the\r\nformer Yugoslavia. But let us not deceive ourselves. Military intervention\r\nby the United Nations is not the way to resolve the main contemporary problems\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl4.7/PV~46\r\n57\r\n(Mr. SQmavia, Chile)\r\nQf security.

Chile)\r\nSouth American countries, based on the princi~le that the security of\r\nindividuals is as important as the security of the State - if not more so.\r\nThese concepts, like those of so many other non-governmental organizations,\r\ngive us an indication of the public\u0027s desire to take part in the consideration\r\nof these sometimes contentious issues.\r\nThese ideas have made their way into governmental thinking, as was shown\r\nby the most recent declaration by the Presidents of the Rio Group at their\r\nfifth summit meeting in Cartagena de Indias in 1991, when they decided to\r\ninitiate the relevant consultations with a view to moving towards an\r\nunderstanding within the Group on the \"proclamation of Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean as a zone of peace\".\r\nDiscussion and fruedom of opinion make it possible to tackle legitimate\r\ndisputes in any society, whereas the absence of discussion and freedom of\r\nopinion can only lead to the building up of underground tensions, which, once\r\nthey surface, are difficult to control.\r\nThe existence of social spaces in which to conduct discussions for the\r\npurpose of achieving consensus and agreement is essential to the preservation\r\nof peace. To this end, it is necessary that we have a culture of tolerance.\r\nThis will enable us not only to be aware of our differences but also, despite\r\nthose differences, to seek out the possibilities for common endeavour.\r\nWe welcome the prominence that the Secretary-Generales report gives to\r\nrecognition of the fact that some sources of instability have their origin in\r\neconomic and social conditions. The United Nations must take timely action to\r\ndeal with economic and social problems and thus prevent their developing into\r\nsources of conflict that wil\\ ultimately constitute a threat to international\r\npeace and security.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/!.lV.46\r\n59-60\r\n(Mr. Somayia, Chile)\r\nChile agrees that economic and social development is necessary as the\r\nfoundation of st~engthened international peace and security. Proof of the\r\nfact that that is Chile\u0027s attitude is to be found in the country\u0027s decisive\r\ncommitment to the promotion of the World Summit for Social Development.\r\nLikewise, we are firmly convinced that democratic practices and respect\r\nfor human rights and fundamental freedoms are intimately linked with the\r\nattainment of international peace and security. Accordingly - as the\r\nSecretary-Generales report indicates - the United Nations must be prepared,\r\nwhen so requested by a State, to cooperate in the transformation and\r\nimprovement of democratic institutions.\r\nThe task of the United Nations is to promote a global atmosphere and a\r\nsystem of international relations that are just and equitable for all. We\r\ninvite the Secretary-General, as others have done, to complement his \"Aga\u0027~da\r\nfor Peace\" with an agenda for development.\r\nWe all know that at the United Nations we have now been presented with a\r\nunique opportunity. We have a duty to design a stable international order in\r\nwhich no one feels marginalized or exploited. This is undoubtedly a long-term\r\ntask, and we must not harbour any illusions about our being able to achieve a\r\nstable international order overnight.\r\nWe have an obligation to create together a vision of the world as we want\r\nit to be tomorrow. We start with a burdensome heritage. Together, the\r\nideologies of the cold war and the increasing dehumanization of economic\r\nprocesses have led to trivialization of the values that are fundamental to any\r\nsociety.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.46\r\n61\r\n(Mr. Somavia. Chile)\r\nI say this because I am convinced that, above all, an \"Agenda for Peace\"\r\nmust be an agenda of shared values. We must have the courage to promote\r\nvalues here in the United Nations. We must have the courage to speak of\r\ntolerance, solidarity, brotherhood, the dignity of the human person, and even,\r\nin this world of realpolitik, love and mutual understanding. This is what\r\nordinary people ezpect of us. We do not have the right to think only of the\r\nshort term.\r\nFor example, as far as values are concerned, we need to ask ourselves,\r\nwhy it seems to be more urgent for the United Nations to act when someone is\r\nkilled by a bullet than when semeone dies from malnutrition. The General\r\nAssembly itself approves - generally without problems, and rightly so - the\r\nsubstantial financing required for the peace-keeping operations decided on by\r\nthe Security Council. And that should be the case. But at the same time we\r\nare all aware that any major initiative in the economic and social field comes\r\nup against the financial barrier that exists here today whereby it must be\r\nconducted \"within existing resources\". Can anyone imagine what would happen\r\nif peace-keeping operations were to be carried out \"within existing resourc£lS\"?\r\nWhat are tha values which lead to death in an armed conflict - tragic and\r\nterrible though it is - being regarded as more important than the 40,000\r\nchildren who die every day from malnutrition and inadequate sanitary\r\nfacilities or, in institutional terms, why is it always so much easier to find\r\nfunding for the urgent initiatives of the Security Council than for those of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly?\r\nAs I have already stat:d, in order to solve these problems we must\r\ncombine \"An Agenda for Peace\" with an agenda for development. The two are\r\ncomplementary and indispensable if we are to construct the United Nations of\r\nthe future.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.46\r\n62\r\n(Mr. Somavia, Chile)\r\nWe do not believe that the attention that ne\u0026d3 to be paid to economic\r\nand social problems as a source of potential conflicts that affect peace and\r\nsecurity .means transferring the functions of the Economic and Soclal Council\r\nto the Security Council. Rather, as the Heads of St.ate or Government affirmed\r\nin the Security Council on 31 January this year\u003d\r\n\"The United Nations membership as a whole, wo.rking throuqh the\r\nappropriate bodies\" - the Security Council, the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly - \"needs to give the highest priority to\r\nthe solution of these matters.\" (S/PV.3046, p. 143)\r\nThat statement refers to the non-military sources of instability in the\r\neconomic, social, humanitarian and ecological fields which have become threats\r\nto peace and security.\r\nThat is evidently not a task for the Security Souncil. It is the\r\nresponsibility of the United Nations system as a whole and, in the; first\r\nplace, of the Secretary-General, who mus~ serve as the symbol of collective\r\naspirations. He must be a catalyst for what is obtainable, give encouragement\r\nto what is difficult and, sometimes, propose what today appears impossible but\r\nwill tomorrow be recognized as sensible and reasonable.\r\nWe congratulate the Secretary-General, who is performing this task with\r\nvision, personality and a s~nse of leadership.\r\nWe in turn, as Governmants, have a duty to provide him with both our\r\nbacking and our guidance.\r\nWe need to be imaginative in thinking about the future and realistic in\r\nseeking to achieve what is possible.

The more people there are who are trained in\r\nthis philosophy of coexistence, the more timely will be the early warnings in\r\nsituations when peace is at risk.\r\nHence the importance of \"An Agenda for Peace\" and the innovative paths it\r\nexplores in relation to the traditional issues of international peace and\r\nsecurity,\r\nWe well know that there is nothing more pragmatic than a good idea,\r\nnothing more realistic than a sound concspt. \"An Agenda for Peace\" is full of\r\nideas and concepts. Let us listen to one another in order to know which ones\r\nwe share, and let us do the impossible to make them possible.\r\nMr, AFONSO (Mozambique): My delegation is pleased to join previous\r\nspeakers in congratUlating the Secretary-General for his excellent and timely\r\nreports on the work of the Organization and \"An Agenda for Peace\".\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly is taking place against a\r\nbackground of continued and ever-groving changes in international relations.\r\nThe cold war is over, and so is the ideological rivalry, the arms race\" the\r\ncompetition for zones of influence and the military power blocs. Positive\r\nchanges have occurred and we now witness a common and global trend towards the\r\nenchancement of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.46\r\n64-65\r\n(Mr. Afonso. Mozambique)\r\nfundamental freedoms. This new situation ~as given hope and, indeed, produced\r\nsome first results in the search.for confli~t resolution.\r\nNotwithstanding these promising opportunities, the Jlnternational\r\ncommunity is still confronted by difficult problems and se~ious challenges\r\nwhich pose potential threats to international peace and se~urity. Such\r\nproblems and challenges include the emergence of extreme nationalism in\r\ncertain areas of the globe, the plight of millions of refugees and displaced\r\npersons victimized by war and armed c~nflicts, the ongoing world-wide economic\r\nrecession ~hich has a severe impact on poverty levels especially in developing\r\ncountries, mounting social tensions which are manifested in racial and\r\nreligious intolerance, and ethnic hostilities. All these fectors, coupled\r\nwith the unchecked environmental degradation, constitute serious threats to\r\nnational and international 3tability.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nItJ4UPV.46\r\n66\r\n(Mr. Afonso. Mozambique)\r\nIn this critic~l historic context Member States are;d~ty bound to seize\r\nthis opportunity for a re~aissance of our Organization, both in strategies and\r\nactions. The Secretary-General\u0027s reports are rich in concepts of a new United\r\nNations for the new era. The Secretary-General\u0027s ideas open a new window of\r\nopportunity for a deliberate and determined exercise of political will and\r\ncorresponding commitment by all Member States in search of a better United\r\nNations, an Organization better equipped to respond to the trust and\r\nexpectations of the peoples of the world. The end of the cold-war rivalry and\r\nbipolarity should afford the United Nations a privileged position in the\r\nefforts to maintain international peace and security, secure justice and human\r\nrights and promote \"social progress and better standards of life in larger\r\nfreedom\", as prescribed in the Charter.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the current political exercise aimed at\r\nstrengthening the role of the United Nations in the promotion of international\r\npeace and security. Cur efforts must continue to be guided by the purposes\r\nand principles of the Charter. The international community must ensure\r\nrespect for the sovereign equality of all States, the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes and strict adherence to the principle of non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of other States.\r\nWhile undertaking these initiatives, we must also ensure the continued\r\nrole of the States as \"the foundation-stone\" of the United Nations work, as\r\nthe Secretary-General put it. Such an approach would be in line with the\r\nprinciples of national sovereignty and territorial integrity, as enshrined in\r\nthe Charter. It would also guarantee the centrality of States in the conduct\r\n•\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAlf.?/PV.45\r\n67\r\n(Mr. Afonso, Mozambique)\r\nof international relations. Respect for sovereign equality ,between States is\r\nvital for the promotion of cooperation and understanding between nations. The\r\nprinciple of sovereign equality is of paramount importance in order to foster\r\nthe credibility and legitimacy of United Nations actions around the globe.\r\nMy delegation concurs with the basic thrust of the proposals and goals\r\ncontained in \"An Agenda for Peace\". In this regard, I should like to\r\nhighlight the critical importance of resorting to preventive diplomacy,\r\nthrough the early identification of potential conflicts; the engagement in\r\npeacemaking efforts where conflic~s ~ake place; the preservation of post-\r\nconflict peace through peace-keeping; and effective and commensurate\r\nassistance in the implementation of agreements achieved. Last but not least,\r\nthe question of post-conflict pvace-building, involving actions aimed at\r\nsupporting structures which can strengthen and solidify peace in order to\r\navoid the resurgence of violence and conflict, plays an important role in\r\nthese endeavoura.\r\nWe believe in the import8Jl~.· the several practical measures suggested\r\nin the repo~t to strengthen the capacity of the Secretariat and the\r\nOrganization at large in putting into place \"An Agenda for Peace\". I wish to\r\nrefer in particular to the xndertaking by the Secretary-General of periodic\r\nconsultations on confidence-building measures, fact-finding missions, the\r\nstrengthening of early warn~ng arrangements of the Unitsd Nations, mediation\r\nand negotiations on behalf of the United Nations, the revitalization and\r\nreinforcement of the role of the International Court of Justice, international\r\nassistance - especially humanitarian assistance to ameliorate conflict\r\nsituations - and countermeasures to mitigate the impact of internationally\r\n..\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.46\r\n68\r\n(Mr. Afo~ Mozambigye)\r\nagreed sanctions.

He view the recently createdOrqanization of\r\nAfrican Unity Mechanism for Preventinq, Managing and Resolving Conflicts in\r\nAfrica as being along the lines mentioned in \"An Agenda for Peace.\"\r\nOn the issue of financing peace-keeping operations, my delegation\r\nbelieves that every effort should be made to find an effective solution which\r\ntakes into account the interests and circumstances of all Member States. as\r\nwell as th~ n~~d to ensure that our Organization performs its fundamental\r\nobjective. the maintenance of internation~l peace and security.\r\nMy country has a ve~ted interest in seeing a sound and secure\r\nfunctioning of the United Nations peace-keeping operations.

The resolution,\r\ninter alia. approved the appointment by the Secretary-General of an interim\r\nSpecial Representative and the dispatch to MOZambique of a team of up to\r\n25 military observers.

We firmly believe that the international community will heed our\r\nappeal.\r\nMany, innovative proposals have been put forward by the Secretary-General\r\nin his \"Agenda for Peace\". My delegation wishes to express its full support\r\nfor the Secretary-General and his approach to and vision of the challenges\r\nfacing the Organization. The expectations and challenges faci~g the United\r\nNations are clearly the very same that face our peoples and nations today. We\r\nshould especially like to single out our support for the idea of setting up a\r\nreserve fund to guarantee the rapid mObilization and deployment of United\r\nNations peace-keeping operations whenever and wherever they are needed. The\r\nestablishment of such a fund wo~ld be another concrete contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nMr. KALPAQE (Sri Lanka): The Sri Lanka delegation would like to\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive r~port on the work of the\r\nOrganization.

We have found this discussion on \"An Agenda for Peace\" to be\r\nextremely useful. The depth of analysis and the range of comments made are\r\nindicative of the complexities involved. The ideas expressed here with\r\ncandour and conviction can provide a basis for further deliberation and\r\nfollow-up action.\r\nOur collective efforts to fulfil the \"Agenda for Peace\" should be pursued\r\nin tandem with the formulation and realization of an agenda for development.\r\nThe peace agenda of the Orqanization must necessarily be underpinned by a\r\ndevelopment agenda to make the overall effort viable and sustainable. We\r\nshare the view that lastinq peace is an inteqrated and dynamic concept\r\nencompassinq securitYI development and social justice. The multilateral\r\nagenda of our Orqanization for the period ahead should therefore lay emphasis\r\non the strateqic triad of shared securitYI development and human welfare.

It is here in the General Assembly\r\nthat overall policy with regard to the proposals in the uAqenda for Peace\"\r\nshould be formulated. Such a policy should be in keeping with the provisions\r\nof the Charter. It should be principled and pragmatic. It should contribute\r\nto the stability and long-term viability of the international system. The\r\nprinciple of sovereign equality requires the participation of all Member\r\nStates in the formulation of such policy.\r\nThe powers of the Assembly, as stated in Article 10 of the Charter,\r\ninclude the power to discuss and make recommendations on qusstions relating to\r\nthe settlement of disputes. The Charter authorizes the Assembly not only to\r\naddress directly the States parti~~ iuvolved in a dispute or situation, but\r\nalso to play an important role in ~e coordination of the activities of the\r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations in the field of the prevention and\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and situations within the provisions of the\r\nCharter.\r\nWe must remain faithful, and unflinchinqly so, to common basic\r\nprinciples: first, the concept of national sovereignty; secondly,\r\nnon-·intervention in the internal affairs of States; and, thirdly, economic\r\ncooperation. The Secretary-General has reminded us that the unlimited\r\nfragmentation of sovereign 3ntities would make it more difficult to achieve\r\npeace, security and economi: well-being for all. External intervention in any\r\nguise cannot be justified, except in accordance with the provisions of the\r\nCharter, particularly in cases where domestic solutions have not been entirely\r\nexhausted.\r\n~---~-----------\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.46\r\n76\r\n(Mr. Kalpage. Sri Lanka)\r\nSri Lanka supports confidence-buildin~measures at all levels. These\r\nmeasures should be aimed at r~ducing threats to security by promoting\r\nopenness. We welcome the Secretary-General\u0027s undertaking periodic\r\nconsultations on confidence-building measures. We believe that periodic\r\nconsultations between the Governments of a region, at the highest political\r\nlevel, would also contribute to the process of regional confidence-building.\r\nThis would provide opportunities to strengthen the existing relations between\r\nStates and to improve mutual understanding and trust.\r\nFact-finding should be objective and carried out in an impartial manner.\r\nIt should contribute to building confidence and to defusing a conflict\r\nsituation. Extreme care should be exercised to ensure that the presence of\r\nfact-finding missions does not aggravate a given situation.\r\nWe are grateful to the Secretary-General for his recommendation that the\r\nSecurity Council devise a set of measures to assist States confronted with\r\nspecial economic problems resulting from the imposition of sanctions under\r\nArticle 41 of the Charter. In this context, it would be pertinent to point\r\nout that action by the Security Council to use force under Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter could cause not only economic problems but human problems as well. We\r\nhave seen, for ex~~ple, the enormous difficulties faced by the large number of\r\nreturnee migrant workers, particularly from developing countries, during the\r\nGulf crisis.\r\nTherefore, we hope that the Security Council will adopt suitable measures\r\nto assist States affected by Security Council decisions under Chapter VII of\r\nthe Char.ter.

Sri Lank~)\r\nOur warm appreciation goes to those who are already bearing the brunt of\r\npeace-keeping operations. A vast expenditure is being incurred. This\r\nexpenditure is bound to increase steeply in the immediate future. This will\r\nbe an important factor in determining the involvement of the United Nations in\r\naction on \"An Agenda for Peace\".\r\nIt is important that the issues related to \"An Agenda for Peace\" be\r\nconsidered as a whole, in an integrated manner. We therefore support the\r\nproposal that an open-ended working group of the General Assembly be entrusted\r\nwith this task.\r\nMr. ERDENECHJJLUUN (Mongolia): The Chairman of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, the representative of Indonesia, Ambassador Wisnumurti, has already\r\nspoken on the item under consideration. On behalf of the Movement, my\r\ndelegation wishes to amplify some of the points that are reflected in that\r\nstatement.\r\nThere was practically no statement in the general debate at this session\r\nof the General Assembly that did not in one way or another touch upon the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\", prepared\r\npursuant to the decision taken by the first Security Council Summit Meeting,\r\nin January this year. This fact alone testifies to the importance that Member\r\nStates attach to the timely issue of the restructuring, revitalization and\r\ndemocratization of the United Nations. Indeed, it is inconceivable to imagine\r\nthe world Organization being unresponsive to the dramatic changes taking place\r\nthroughout the world. We believe that this report is the result of a logical\r\nevolution of the new perceptions that ought to guide the United Nations in\r\naddressing major challenges that are before us.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA147/PV.46\r\n78\r\n(Mr. Erdenechuluun, Mongolia)\r\nWe welcome the thought-provoking report of the Secretary-General, which\r\ncontains innovative ideas and concepts designed to enhance the role of the\r\nOrganization in safeguarding !nte~ational poace and security. As the\r\nSecretary-General has drawn upon the experience of peace-keeping operations in\r\nrecent years, which are characterized by their growing scope and dimensions,\r\nthe report represents an integral concept, covering all the political and\r\nmilitary components - that is, preventive diplomacy, peacemaking,\r\npeace-keeping and post-conflict peace-building.\r\nMy delegation wishes to emphasize that among these four major components\r\nthe United Nations and its Member States must give priority attention to\r\npreventive diplo~acy and exert every effort to utilize it to the full. The\r\nideal situation would undoubtedly be the solution to a problem within the\r\nframework of preventive diplomacy. In other words, we have to make sure that\r\nevery means of preventive diplomacy is exhausted before we emarbark on the\r\nnext stage.\r\nAs far as the peacemaking component is concerned, we wish to single out\r\nparagraph 41 of the report, which deals with special economic problems of the\r\nthird parties that might be affected by the imposition of sanctions. We\r\nsupport the Secretary-General\u0027s idea of putting in place a set of measures to\r\ninsulate States from economic difficulties. Mongolia is among the many\r\ncountries that are being affected by the ongoing sanctions. In tb;,s respect,\r\nmy delegation commends the important and timely efforts of the Special\r\nCommittee on the Charter of the United Nations to study ways and means to\r\nensure prompt and adequate response to requests f~r assistance under\r\nArticle 50 of the Charter. We believe that such specific proposals as the\r\nestablishment of a compensatory fund administered by the Security Council and\r\nthe freezing of assets of the offender-State should command the attention of\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.46\r\n79-80\r\n(Mr. Erdenechuluun. Mongolia)\r\nthe Special Committee at its future sessions. Here, I wish to note the\r\nadoption of Security Council resolution 778 (1992) as an impor~ant\r\npreced~nt-settinqdecision of the Council to hold the Qffender-Stat~\r\nresponsible for some specific obligations and payments.\r\nThe activities of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United\r\nNations and the Strengthening of the Rols of the O~qanization are instrumental\r\nin the ongoing efforts to revitalize the United Nations. We hope that the\r\n~\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report will qivo the Special Committee a new impetus to\r\nfinalize the consideration of items on its agenda and. proceed to take up new\r\nimportant questions for dis~us5ion.\r\nWe applaud a new concept in the Secretary-General\u0027s report regarding\r\npost-conflict peace-building, which represents a logical completion of\r\npeacemaking and peace-keeping operations. Having said that, I wish to note\r\nhere that we are not suggesting any strict compartmentalization or separation\r\nof these interlinked compon!nts. Rather, depending on a given situation, some\r\nof the components could and should be utilized in parallel. It should be\r\nemphasized that any innovative idea or new approach must be conceived within\r\nthe limits of the underlying principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe Security Council, ~hich bears primary responsibility for maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security, after having been freed from the handicaps\r\nof the cold-war era has undoubtedly become a much more effective instrument in\r\ncarrying out its mandate.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.46\r\n131\r\n(Mr. Erdenechuluun, Mongolia)\r\nAt the same time, we believe that changes have to be made in both the\r\ncomposition and the workings of the Council so as to reflect the new reality\r\nappropriately. Democratization of United Nations bodies requires transparency\r\nand accountability in the work of the Security Council as well. This also\r\nimplies the need for a balanced relationship among the Security Council, the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Secretary-General, in accordance with the provisions\r\nof the Charter.\r\nIt has been widely recognized that security concepts have come to\r\nencompass not only military and political but also economic, social,\r\nhumanitarian and environmental aspects. We fully aqree with the vie~ ~tated\r\nby the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization that\r\n\"Political proqress and economic development are inseparable: both\r\nare e\u0027qually important and m.ust be pursued simultaneously.\" (1./47/1,\r\nIt is in that context that my delegation supports the call addressed to the\r\nSecretary-General for an agenda for development.\r\nMy delegation notes with interest the various ideas put forward with\r\nregard to rectifying the extremely difficult financial situation of the\r\nOrganization. It goes without saying that the sound financial basis of the\r\nOrganization is the collective responsibility of all Member States. We\r\nsupport the idea of establishing a revolving peace-keepinq reserve fund of\r\n$50 million that would help secure the financing of the initial stages of new\r\npeace-keeping operations.\r\nAlongside the various proposals and recommendations contained in the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report, the current deliberations have produced a host of\r\nnew ideas that we believe require thorough study and extensive discussion by\r\n•\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.46\r\n82\r\n(Mr. Irdenechulyun, Mongolia)\r\nall Member States. In this respect, my delegation is in favour of setting up\r\nan open-ended working group to examine the report and the proposals of Member\r\nStates and to come up with specific recommendations. We hope a decision to\r\nthat effect can be adopted as soon as possible in order to enable the working\r\ngroup to begin its work in the course of the present session.\r\nThe report of the Seoretary-General on the work of the Organization\r\ncontains a synthesis of the ongoing restructuring process and of\r\nforward-looking strategies to deal with global challenges. Both reports of\r\nthe Secretary-General are mutually supportive, and we regard them as an\r\nimportant contribution towards attaininq the objective set by the\r\nSecretary-General to complete the present phase in the renewal of the\r\nOrganization by 1995, its fiftieth anniversary.\r\nThe PRESIPENt (interpretation from French): In accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions 3237 (XXIX) of 22 November 1974 and 43/177 of\r\n15 December 1988, I now call on the representative of the Observer delegation\r\nof Palestine.\r\nMr, AL-KIpWA (Palestine) (interpretation from Arabic): I wish to\r\nconvey to Ambas\u0026ador Ganev my congratulations upon his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly for this session and to express my\r\nappreciation to him and to his friendly country, Bulgaria.

Allow me furthermore to thank him for his\r\nimportant report, \"An Ag\u0027enda for peace\", prepared at the invitation of the\r\nhistoric Security Council summit which represented a new mechanism for dealing\r\nwith the highly important world issues. We hope that meeting will be repeated\r\nin the future so that concrete results may be achieved. When we speak of\r\nthis, we must not forget that the idea of holding such a meeting was\r\nintroduced for the first time by the President of France when he suggested the\r\nconvening of a Security Council summit meeting to deal with the situation in\r\nthe Middle East.\r\nIt is important for us to be able ~o participate in this si~Aificant\r\ndebate on the most effective means of achieving lasting peace in the world\r\nthrough preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and post--conflict\r\npeace-building as well as on the means of enabling the United Nations and its\r\nvarious organs, especially the Security Council, to carry out that entire\r\nprogramme in the most efficient manner possible.\r\nThe debate acquires more significance because it takes place now, at a\r\ntime when we have a historic opportunity to build a better world. The old\r\nworld order has crumbled and with it its main feature, the cold war and the\r\nattendant danger of nuclear confrontation. This has given rise to high hopes\r\nregarding the establishment of a new world order that would be free from the\r\ndanger of confrontation and safe from the deva.stet.ion of war, as it would be\r\nfree from rivalry for dominion and influence: a world that would be built OD\r\njustice and the rule of law, a world which would attach high importance to\r\ndevelopment, to the struggle against poverty and want, to the upholding of\r\nhuman rights and to the preservation of the environment.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAJ\u002747/PV.46\r\n84\r\n(Mr. Al-Kidwa. Palestine)\r\nThere is no doubt that during the short period since the change started\r\nand up to the present, several achievements have been made, including: a\r\ngreater awareness of the real problems that beset the world; an acceptance of\r\nthe importance of in-depth debate amongst all parties on those problems and on\r\nthe means of solving them; an increased readiness on the part of all to put\r\naside positions that had been held for lonq periods of tim81 in addition, of\r\ncourse, to the numerous democratic transformations that have led to the\r\nconsolidation of freedom in many partq of the world. Those achievements also\r\nincluded the settl~ment of numerous longstanding regional conflicts and\r\ndisputes.\r\nThis, of course, has a major significance that cannot be denied.\r\nHowever, it is also undeniable that we are still a long way off from the\r\nbright picture we have visualized of a new situation in the world. There are\r\nstill major disagreements on the scale of priorities and even on the\r\nformulation of concrete meanings and definitions of the goals we declare that\r\nwe have set for ourselves and of the means of achieving such goals.\r\nIn addition, the economic suffering of the South continues, and the gap\r\nthat separates it from the North is widening. Several regional conflicts,\r\nwith their attendant threats to international peace and security, continue\r\nunabated and without solution. Moreover, new conflicts break out, in an\r\noutrageous manner, without even the prospect of this being brought under\r\ncontrol. Meanwhile, we must admit that confidence in the moral and legal\r\nfoundation of certain positions is receding~ while fears of selectivity,\r\ndouble standards and the appetite of some for dominance and hegemony on the\r\nascendant. All this may be the source of the importance we attach to our\r\ndiscussion here, today, and to the many other debates on the international\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA1471PV.46\r\n85\r\n(Mr. Al-Kidwa, Palestine)\r\nsituation.

In this respect, allow me to make some comments which we deem\r\nto be important:\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nE\u0027alestine}\r\n11 be able\r\nribute.\r\nreement\r\nproposals\r\nne\r\nch we deem\r\nA/47/PV.46\r\n86\r\n(Mr. AI-Kidwa. Palestine)\r\nWe believe that what the report says w1\u0027th regard to self-determination\r\nfor peoples reflects the desire to check the aggravation of the phenomenon of\r\nfragmentation of States and we believe that this must be read without\r\ncontradiction to the principle relating to the b 1 t \u0027ha so u e rlg t of peoples under\r\ncolonialism and foreign occupation to exercise self-determination as that is a\r\nright which has been enshrined as one of the purposes of the United Nations.\r\nin the Organization\u0027s Charter.\r\nWe believe that the importance of the United Nations and the significance\r\nof its enhanced role in the field of peacemaking and peace-keeping will always\r\ndepend on the shouldering by the United Nations of its role and normal\r\nresponsibilities vis-a-vis all disputes and regional conflicts alike without\r\nexceptions or selectivity under any pretext. We further believe that it is\r\nillogical for the Security Council to leap towards the assumption of tasks in\r\nnew areas regardless of the importance of such areas. without the discharge.\r\nor at least the effective handling. by the Council of its principal tasks\r\nunder its present mandate. Furthermore. we believe that success in achieving\r\nall that is envisaged in the report regarding the increased efficacy of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Security Council\u0027s activities in the fields of\r\npreventive diplomacy. peacemaking. peace-keeping and post-conflict\r\npeace-building shall not depend solely on the ability of the Security Council\r\nto impose the implementation of some coercive measures in order to enforce\r\nsome of its resolutions under Chapter 7 of the Charter. More importantly.\r\nsuccess shall depend on the Security Council\u0027s ability to impose the\r\nimplementation and follOW-Up of. as well as full adherence to. all its other\r\nresolutions. together with full adherence to Article 25 of the United Nations\r\nCharter. once again, without exceptions or selectivity.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n----------------\r\nAl47/PV.46\r\n87\r\n(Mr. AI-Kidwa, Palestine)\r\nWhile speaking of the work of the Security Council, we must state that\r\nalthough there have been some positive signs, such as the fact that the right\r\nof veto has not been used over the past two years, we have to voice our\r\nconcern over some other disturbing features of the Council\u0027s activities,\r\nespecially the lack of transparency and the increased tendency to selectivity,\r\nwhether in the manner of dealing with crises or in the area of adhering to\r\nrules or implementing resolutions.\r\nIn general, we believe that the C~uncil must undergo certain structural\r\nand functional reforms that would reflect better the new international\r\nsituation and lead to better results. We also believe that the absolute\r\nimportance of the principal responsibilities entrusted to the Security\r\nCouncil, namely the maintenance of international peace and security, requires\r\nthat priority should be given to that task and also require effective\r\nparticipation by all. Such participation could be achieved only in the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We remain convinced of the need for the General Assembly to\r\ncomplete and follow up its discussion of the Secretary-General\u0027s report in a\r\nmore comprehensive manner. This could be done properly through the work of an\r\nopen-ended working group.\r\nWe cannot deny or even forget for one moment that we belong to Palestine\r\nand the Middle East; we ~.ive its crises daily. Therefore, when we examine or\r\nspeak of ideas and the means of achieving peace and when we hear others\r\nspeaking of that, we cannot but make comparisons between what is being said,\r\non the one hand, and what is actually taking place in the Middle East on the\r\nother. When the issue unde~ discussion is a bigger and more effective role\r\nfor the United Nations, we cannot but remember that the United Nations has\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.46\r\n88\r\n(Mr. AI-Xidwa, Palestine)\r\nbeen barred from supervisinq or even participating in the Midd~e East peace\r\nprocess currently under way. When the issue under discussion is compliance\r\nwith Security Council resolutions, which represent the internatio~alwill, we\r\ncannot but remember that, since 1967, Israel has not complied with any of the\r\nSecurity Council\u0027s resolutions relating to the situation in the occupied\r\nPalestinian territory, including AI-Quds, and that it has even publicly\r\nrejected some of those resolutions and has refused to receive commissions sent\r\nby the Council. When the issue under discussion is the non-proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, including chemical weapons, we cannot but\r\nremember that Israel is being enabled daily to acquire and stockpile nuclear\r\nweapons.\r\nI am not going to go on. However, the question remains: how can we\r\nreconcile the veracity of such noble ideas, on the one hand, with what goes on\r\ndaily in our country and our region, on the other? Unfortunately~ that is not\r\npossible. However, this will not make us lose faith or weaken our belief in\r\nthose ideas and will not prevent us from being open to the new world. Rather,\r\nit makes us more determined to change the situation in our region and to bring\r\nit in line with those ideas. We are ready, and the right beginning for the\r\nothers is to end the contradiction between what they say an~ what they do.\r\nThis would enable us to move in the right direction, towards a just and\r\n\\sting peace in the Middle East, that could be built by all of us, as an\r\nintegral part of the peace and security of the whole world.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.20 p.m.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n"
