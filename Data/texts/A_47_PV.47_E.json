In this connection I have requested the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Uruguay to chair the working group on my behalf. Since the\r\nsubject-matter encompasses economic, social and administrative and budgetary\r\nissues, due care will be given to close consultations with \" Chairmen of the\r\nSecond, Third and Fifth Committees.\r\nThe Assembly will continue its consideration of agenda item 47 at a\r\nfuture meeting, to be announced in the Journal.\r\nAGENDA ITEM 10 (continv.,gg)\r\nREPonT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ON THE WORK OF THE ORGANIZATION: REPORTS OF\r\nTHE SECRETARY-GENERAL (Al47/l, A/47/277)\r\nMr LUNA (Peru) (interpretation from Spanish): The delegation of\r\nPeru agrees with the views expressed by the Permanent Representative of\r\nArgentina on behalf of the Rio Group a few weeks ago and with what Indonesia\r\nsaid on behalf of the non-aligned countries. However, we wish to make a few\r\nadditional points that in our opinion are of particular importance.\r\nWe are pleased that a substantive debate is taking place on th~ annual\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization. Such a\r\ndebate, prompted on this occasion by the almost simultaneous publication of\r\nIDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV~.7\r\n3-5\r\n.\u0027 . (Hr Lunar Peru)\r\nI\r\nthe special report \"An Agenda for Pf!~c~\", should be encouraged and become the\r\npormanent practice. The two docmnents are complementary and l:thould be\r\nconsidered together.\r\nThe special report of the Secretary-General, \"An Agenda for Peace\", is an\r\nimportant analysis of the intornational situation and contains many\r\ninitiatives in the area of international peace and security. It has a solid\r\ninternal logical structure, and includes many novel proposals. We support the\r\nidea of establishing a working group of the General Assembly to study it in\r\ndetail.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.47\r\n6\r\n(Mr. Lunar Peru)\r\nFor its part, the Secretary-General\u0027s 1992 report on the work o~ the\r\nOrganization Gets out the activities carried out by the ~nited Nations in the\r\narea of peace-keeping and with respect to its internal ins~itutional\r\norganization, particularly with respect to simplifying the Secretariat and\r\nstrengthening the international civil service. But its greatest contribution\r\nmay be its concern with the question of development.\r\nThe documents before us paint a realistic picture. On the one hand,\r\nthere are vast possibilities that require the commitment of all the Members of\r\nthe Organization to make them a reality; on the other, there is the need to\r\navoid certain risks in our collective efforts. I shall address three areas of\r\nspecial importance for the futuro of multilateral action.\r\nThe special report, \"An Agenda for Peace\", recognizes the key importance\r\nof respect for national sovereignty as a basis for the Organization\u0027s\r\nactivities, but it re\"ffirms the need to redefine that concept. At present,\r\nsovereignty in its traditional sense is under attack on two fronts: \u0027the trend\r\ntowards fragmentation of national so~ereignty by centripetal forces~ and the\r\nneed for multilateral action properly to administer the transnational dynamic\r\nof the new world problems and protagonists.\r\nThus the reinterpretation of sovereignty is a vital task that should go\r\nbeyond mere exhortation to seek a way of reconciling sovereignty with\r\nself-determination, partiCUlarly the self-determination of minorities. That\r\nwould free it from its first limiting factor.\r\nBut at the same time an evolving concept of sovereignty should\r\naccommodate various national sovereignties on the basis of mutual concessions\r\nIDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAJ47/PV.47\r\n7\r\n(Mr. Lunar Peru)\r\nin line with an internatio~al consensus - democratically reached by the entire\r\ninternational community, and not imposed by one group of countries - on the\r\npriority objectives of multilateral action and the machinery for attaining\r\nthem internationally within the United Nations system.\r\nThat would make it possible to view the whole question of sovereignty in\r\na broader perspective and thus to channel the interventionist trend in the\r\npost-cold-war world into areas and modalities that would make it beneficial\r\nfor the entire international community. Failure to do this would reduce the\r\nquestion of sovereignty to one of dealing with the problems that can be posed\r\nto national Governments by emerging nationalistic and ethnic trends within\r\nStates.\r\nIn that connection, I would note that while in developed countries,\r\nparticularly those of Europe, the end of the cold war has led to the\r\nproliferation of nationalistic, ethnic and minority conflicts, the\r\nwinding-down of nationalistic conflicts in the South has come about in the\r\ncontext of the emergence ot a new generation of problems. In the case of\r\nLatin America, narco-terro~ism is particularly significant.\r\nIn this scenario, cooperation with regional organizations is to be viewed\r\nnot in the sense of subord\\nation to the world Organization, but in terms of\r\ntechnical assistance. In ~is connection, the convening of a conference of\r\nregional organizations to define their needs has been proposed unofficially••\r\n• Mr. Honghe (Benin), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n(Mr. Lunar Pery)\r\nThe proposed establishment of regional risk-~eduction centres is an\r\nextremely important initiative. But it is still not cIGar ~hat department of\r\nthe Headquarters Secretariat would be responsible for coordinating tho cent~es\r\nto enable them to do their job properly.\r\nThe emphasis \"An Agenda for Peace\" places on cooperation wi.th regional\r\norganizations seems, in a more general and broader sense, to be in line with\r\nthe desire to promote democratization in international relations through\r\ngreater and more direct participation by regional groupings, non-gov~rnmental\r\norganizations and society at large. As far as possible, the p05itions adopted\r\nby regional groups in the United Nations on the fundamental issues before the\r\nOrganization must reflect due coherence among the various entities.\r\nFor countries like Per~ it is necessary to stress a concept that is of\r\nthe greatest importance fOl the future work of the United Nations: economic\r\nand social issues cannot ~d should not ap~ear to be subordinate to\r\nconflict-settlement. If i~ were, the United Nations would seem to be\r\naddreasing primarily quest10ns of international peace and security, leaving\r\nI\r\neconomic matters to institutions that supposedly have certain comparative\r\nadvantages in that respect, and social issues to the specialized agencies.\r\nSuch compartmentalization would limit development efforts and reduce the role\r\nof the United Nations in th~t sphere to humanitarian and technical\r\nassistance. This would not accord with the spirit or the letter of the San\r\nI\r\nFrancisco Charter. Moreov~r, it would involve many risks fo~ the developing\r\ncountries, in that econom~c and social issues would be qiven a lower priority\r\nthan issues of peace and s3curit7.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n--------------~------- ----- --\r\nAl47/PV.47\r\n9\r\n(Mr, Lun~, Peru)\r\nMoreover, such a division.of labour wou.ld leave 1the United l\u0027lations unable\r\nto tackle both spheres of action simultaneously; deali.nq \u0027\"11th international\r\neconomic and social issues could be indefinitely postponed within the United\r\nNations, with the exception of those directly related to the resolution of\r\nspecific crises or conflicts.\r\nTo eGtablish a genuine, development-oriented multilateral system of\r\ncooperation and cuordination, it is vital to recognize ~be imp.ortance of\r\nsocial, economic, humanitarian afid environmental issues for the future of the\r\ninternational community, fe.r these are at the heart of tb\" relationship\r\nbetween the poo~ countries and the rich. Paradoxically, these issues are not\r\nyet being given eithQr pro~e~ attention or adequate resources. Apart from a\r\nfew notable efforts, United Nations action in this sphere continues to be\r\ninadequate and limited.\r\nIn this regard\" .the developing countries have proposed that a strateqy be\r\ndeveloped, on the basis of consistent, balanced and non-discriminatory\r\napplication of the principles of the Charter, incorporating all aspects of the\r\nworld situation, both those related to international peace and security and\r\nthose related to development, and that a broad consensus be achievsd in order\r\nto put it into practice. I believe that that would determine tile viability of\r\nmultilateral diplomacy in today\u0027s world.\r\nAwareness of the risks I have described and of the need for the United\r\nNations to make an appropriate institutional response has led over the past\r\nyear to a reorganization o~ the Secretariat. The second stage of this\r\nreorganization, which shoutd be put into effect in the near futurl~, should\r\nconcentrate on enhancing the interdependent functions in the economic and\r\nsocial sphere.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.47\r\nla\r\n(Mr. Lunar Peru)\r\nIn that connection, unifying the management of Secretariat activities in\r\nthe areas of development, cooperation and the environment would help make them\r\nmore effective and facilita~e coordination of the activities of the system\u0027s\r\nspecialized agencies. This. should not be an exercise in bureaucratic\r\nappropriation, where Head~\\:arters takes on functions that by their very nature\r\nshould be carried out by States and that might also overburden the\r\nOrganization. As has been indicated, the United Nations should be making an\r\nintellectual and political effort to define the way it will handle development\r\ncooperation in the future and the guiding role of the United Nations in this\r\nwhole area.\r\nIt is almost trite to say that the United Nations is at a historic\r\nturning point. In order not to waste this so-called regained opportunity,\r\nwhich we all welcome, we m~st think out and put into practice, preferably\r\nunder unified and effectivp. leadership, an agenda for development to\r\ncomplement our Agenda for Peace, in such a way that the priority given to the\r\nproblems of peace will fac~litate the handling of the problems of development,\r\nand vice versa.\r\nIDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI\r\nAl471PV.47\r\n11\r\nMr, TRINli XUAN LNm (Viet Nam): The CU1\u0027rent international situation\r\nand the expectations of the world\u0027s peoples in the capacity of the United\r\nNations today require that the Organization undergo a fundamental renewal,\r\nThe Secretary-General states in his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization that ~he years between 1992 and the fiftieth anniversary, in\r\n1995, may well determine the course and contribution of the Organization for\r\nthe next generation or more. In this connection, on behalf of the Vietnamese\r\ndelegation I should like to express our appreciation of the efforts made by\r\nthe Secretary-General in preparing his annual report on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/47/1) ot 11 September 1992 and his earlier report of\r\n17 June 1992, entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277), Those efforts\r\nreflect his commitment to revitalizing the world body with a view to making it\r\nmore effective in maintaining international peace and security and\r\ncontributing to the solution of global issues, Important and innovative, the\r\ndocuments contain many new ideas which require thorough examination and the\r\nwidest consultation among all Members of the Organization, My delegation\r\nsupports the proposal to establish an open-ended working group of the General\r\nAssembly to make an in-depth study of the recommendations contained in \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\",\r\nAs there will be other opportunities for us to discuss specific proposals\r\nmade by the Secretary-General in his reports, I shall confine myself now to\r\ngiving our views on some aspects of the reports which are of major concern to\r\nus as a non-aligned, developing country and a member of the Group of 77.\r\nThe present international situation is characterized by, inter alia, the\r\ngap between the rich and poor countries, between the North and the South. In\r\ntoday\u0027S interdependent world, unless these phenomena are redressed lasting\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/471PV.47\r\n12\r\n(Mr. Trinh Xuan Lang, Viet Ram)\r\ninternational peace and security cannot be onsured. Two thirds of the world\u0027s\r\npopulation in developing countries are living in difficult economic\r\nconditions. In his annual report on the work of the Organization, the\r\nSecretary-General stated:\r\n\"It is unacceptable that absolute poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy\r\nand hopelessness should be th0 lot of one fifth of the world\u0027s\r\npopulation.\" (A/47/1. para. 61)\r\nand\r\n\"Political progress and economic development are inseparable\".\r\n(A/i\u0027ll, para. 64)\r\nWe are encouraged by the Secretary-General\u0027s view that the Organization\u0027s\r\nresponsibilities an~ ~ommitments in the political and security area should net\r\nbe carried out at the expense of its responsibilities in the development\r\nfield, and neither should be subordinated to the other and that it is\r\nessential that they be pursued in an integrated, mutually supporting way. We\r\nappreciate his commitment to enhance the renewal of global partnership for\r\ndevelopment and to work out an agenda for development, as reflected in his\r\nreport, and we hOl?e that the agenda for development will be treatt!d wit.h equal\r\nattention.\r\nAs one of the countries confronted with special economic problems, due to\r\nthe implementation of economic sanctions under Chapte~ VII of the Charter, we\r\nurga the Secretary-General to take appropriate measures, inclUding resort to\r\nthe financial instit~tions within the United Nations system, to assist those\r\ncountries, as provided for by Article 50 of the Charter. It is our s~r~ug\r\nbelief that the United Nations should have full responsibility for all its\r\nactions, inclUding redressing the difficulties faced by those countries as a\r\nresult of their implementation of United Nations resolutions.\r\nIDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI\r\nAl471PV,47\r\n13\r\n(Mr, Trinb xuan Lang, Viet Nam)\r\nDuring the 47 years since the founding of the United Nations, while\r\nmankind has been spared an annihilating world war, hundreds of large-scale and\r\nsmall-scale wars and conflicts have taken place in various regions, with\r\ndevastating consequences, One of the most common factors leading to those\r\nwars and conflicts, as was vividly demonstrated in the Viet Nam wars during\r\nthe three decades following the Second World War, was disregard for the\r\nprinciple of respect for national independence and sovereignty and the\r\nintegrity of States,\r\nNow that the United Nations is discussing ways and means to prevent and\r\nresolve conflicts and preserve peace in the new situation following the end of\r\nthe cold war and the disintegration of the old international order, based on\r\nthe division of the world into two blocs, the sacrosanct principles as stated\r\nby the Secretary-General in his report \"An Agenda for Peace\" that\r\n\"The foundation-stone of this work is and must remain the State\".\r\nan~ that\r\n\"Respect for its fundamental sovereignty and integrity are crucial to any\r\ncommon international prQgress,\" (A/471277, para 17)\r\nhave to be strictly and truly respected, In his statement before the Assembly\r\nin the general debate, our Foreign Minister emphasized that while isolationism\r\nwas outmoded, national sovereignty for ever remained a sacred value which all\r\ncountries, large or small, rich or poor, are determined to defend.\r\nWe are of the view that any decision taken after our discussion of these\r\ndocuments, both now and later, must ba based on strict adherence to the\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and the recognized norms of\r\ninter-State conduct, partiCUlarly the principles of full respect for national\r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.47\r\n14-15\r\n(~r. Trinh Xuan LanS\u0027, Viet Uam)\r\naff\u0026irs of States. The concept of national sovereignty can in no way be\r\neroded. At the same time, respect for the right to self-determination of all\r\npeoples under colonial ~r foreign occupation must be ensured.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations, as the most universal internatio~al\r\nOrganization devoted to peace and development, should do its utmost to\r\nstrengthen its capaeity for the pacific settlement of disputes and avoid the\r\nuse of force. We advocate the peaceful settlement of all disputps through\r\ndialogue and negotiations without resort to force or the threat of force.\r\nWhile recognizing the forward-looking approach in some specific\r\nrecommendations relating to preventive diplomacy, such as fact-finding, we\r\nbelieve that fact-finding should be conducted only on the basis of the\r\nprinciple of a request from a Member State and the prior consent of all\r\nconcerned parties. This requirement has been laid down iu various General\r\n\u0027.\r\nAssembly resolutions ~n the subject.\r\nThe effectiveness of the concerted efforts of the United Nations in the\r\nfield of preventing and resolving conflicts and preserving peace will depend\r\non the credibility of the O~ganization\u0027s consistency in the application of the\r\nprinciples of the Charter.\r\nIDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471TN.47\r\n:i.6\r\n(Mr. TriM Xuan Lang, Yiet Nam)\r\nIn this connection, we share the view, as expressed by the Secretary-General,\r\nthat the principles of the Charter must be applied consistently, not\r\nselectively. The point my delegation would like to stress is that the\r\nconsistent and non-selective application of the Cha~ter can only be ensured by\r\nthe democratization of international life and inter-State relations and the\r\nreform and restructuring of the United Nations. Here again, I would like to\r\nrefer to the statement of our Foreign Minister before the Assembly, where he\r\nsaid\r\n\"In the new context, the composition of the Security Council and the\r\nbalance between the Council, the General Assembly and the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations must reflect the realities of a\r\nworld which has radically changed as compared with the time when the\r\nUnited Nations was bor~, and even with only a few years ago.\r\n\"We endorse the idea of re-examining and enlarging the composition\r\nof the Security Council, with due attention to developing countries, with\r\na view to fully implementing the principle of equality between all Member\r\nStates and ensuring that the voice of the majority is duly heard in the\r\nprocess of making decisions on issues of critical importance to the\r\ninternational comnl1,mi.ty.\" (A/471PV.23, pp. 44-45 and 46)\r\nI\r\nIt is our strong belief that the new and efficient United Nations must\r\nrepresent the majority and collective aspirations of its membership and that\r\nall Member State~ have the right to participate actively and democratically in\r\nthe promotion of collectiva interests of the global community.\r\nFinally, we wish to n;sure the Secretat\u0027y-General of our support for his\r\nefforts and his objective I.f strengthening and making more efficient within\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.47\r\n17\r\n(Mr. TriM Xuan Lang, Viet Nam)\r\nthe framework and provisions of the Charter, the capacity of the United\r\nNations in the mainCenance of international peace and security, as well as in\r\notber areas. Improveme:ai:. is a never-ending task. We hope that the\r\nSecretary-Generalis objective will be achieved and that, with the efforts and\r\nthe participation of all Member States, a f~damental renewal of the United\r\nNations in other fields will be complete by the time it marks its fiftieth\r\nanniversary.\r\nMr. PEER+~ (Mauritius): I welcome the opportunity to participate\r\nin the discussions on the report of the Secretary-General, \"An Agenda for\r\nPeace\", which we have already commended in our statement in the general debate\r\nat this session. It is an important document that will have fundamental\r\nimplications for the future of our Organization. Therefore, it is quite\r\nfitting that the General Assembly, under the presidency of Mr. Ganev, should\r\nhave begun an early debate on the Secretary-General\u0027s proposals under agenda\r\nitem 10. As many speakers have indicated before me, we are only at the\r\ninitial phase of discuasions. The debate will be pursued at different levels\r\ninside the Organization.\r\nI would hope, however, that the Assembly will be able to record the huge\r\ninterest generated by the r~port and perhaps offer directions or guidelines\r\nfor the future in the light of progress achieved. For, as the\r\nSecretary-General himself .\"eminds us, the coming years until 1995 may well\r\ndetermine the course and contribution of the Organization for the next\r\ngeneration or beyond.\r\nThe Secretary-General has embarked on an ambitious task of defining a new\r\nrole in the humanitarian field and maxing the Organization more effective in\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA./471PV.47\r\n18\r\n(Mr. Peerthum, ~itius)\r\nmaintaining and promoting peace. The United Nations can best contribute to\r\nthe strenqt.h\u0026ninq of collective security in such areas of vital importance,\r\nespecially to smaller States.\r\nIn his annual report on the work of the Organization, the\r\nSecretary-General remarks that United Nations activities have greatly expanded\r\nin recent years, particularly since the end of the cold wa~. The\r\nresponsibilities of the Organization have grown and so have cur expectations.\r\nUnfortunately, the United Nations may not be able to respond to these new\r\nchallenges if it is not provided with the necessary resources to face them.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome the suggestions of the non-aligned group and\r\notb~r delegations that an open working group be established by the General\r\ni\\ssembly to examine tile Secretary-General\u0027s report \"An Agenda for Peace\".\r\nThat a majority of States is taking part in this thought-provoking and crucial\r\ndebate is of great significance. We must therefore ensure that our\r\ndeliberations uphold rather than undermine the high aspirations and concrete\r\nobjectives contained in \"An Agenda for Peace\".\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" identifies thosa challenges and objectives, and\r\noffers clear and pragmatic solutions. The Secretary-General calls for sounder\r\nand more reliable financing, better communications and tools for preventive\r\ndiplomacy and less cumbersome mechanisms and procedures for peace-keeping\r\noperations than those enforceable under Chapter VII of the Charter,\r\nparticularly in an increasingly volatile international environment where\r\nlocalized conflicts may recur. These proposals must be looked at in their\r\nentirety. Favouring one issue over another or widening the debate will only\r\ndilute the thrust of the package.\r\n-\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/471PV.47\r\n19-20\r\n(Mr. Peerthum, Mauritius)\r\nIn choosing to be pragmatic, the Agenda is necessarily selective. It may\r\nnot fully address, for example, the serious concerns of non-military threats\r\nto peace and a whole range of interdependent eco~omic issues that hav~\r\nimplications for global security and national security. The new app~oach\r\nadvocated by the Secretary-General also raises numerous questions about\r\nsovereignty, the principle of consent, the interpretation of the Chart~lr, the\r\npre-eminence and credibility of the Council and its relations with the General\r\nAssembly. But the Organization is at a crossroad and it cannot be impervious\r\nto the process of evolution. \"An Agenda for Peace\" offers us the opportunity\r\nfor change at a crucial period. Change may be advocated at a faster pace in\r\none direction rather than another. That does not mean that needed reforms in\r\nother fields will necessarity stagnate. They may in fact benefit from a\r\nsnowballing effect, for tho major obstacles to change at the United Nations\r\nreMain the lack of political will and the absence of financial resources.\r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\" addresses them head on and deserves our full\r\nsupport.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n--------------------_.._--\r\nAl471PV.47\r\n21\r\nMr. NYAKII (United Republic of Tanzania): The delegation of\r\nIndonesia has already spoken on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement on agenda\r\nitem 10. My delegation associates itself with that statement. For this\r\nreason, I will limit my comments to a few areas of the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nreport, \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/471277), dated 17 June 1992, which my\r\ndelegation feels need stressing. First, let me also extend my delegation\u0027s\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for a very comprehensive,\r\nthought-provoking and challenging report.\r\nAs the Secretary-General stressed in his report, and as many delegations\r\nhave repeated both during the general debate and in the present debate, the\r\ninternational political situation has undergone a fundamental change. The old\r\norder has collapsed and a new one, which offers hope in the search to\r\nsolutions to longstanding problema, is emerging. The demands on the United\r\nNations to respond positively to peoples\u0027 rising aspirations everywhere for\r\npeace and security, for economic and social justice, and for democracy and the\r\nenjoyment of human rights, are unprecedented. It is important that the United\r\nNations capacity to respond to these demands be enhanced in these propitious\r\ntimes.\r\nI \u0026hould like to touch briefly on the scope of the report. The Security\r\nCouncil mandate of 31 January 1992 requested the Secretary General to prepare\r\n\"analysis and recommendations on ways of strengthening and making more\r\nefficient within the framework and provisions of the Charter the capacity\r\nof the United Nations for preventive diplomacy, for peacemaking and for\r\npeace-keeping\". (8/23;00, p.3)\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.47\r\n22\r\n(Mr. Nyakyi, United Republic\r\n2f Tanzania)\r\nAt the time\" many developing countries expressed concern that the report\r\nran the risk of being narrowly focused, ignoring their legitimate concerns and\r\ninterests, which have a bearing on questions of international peace and\r\nsecurity. We are encouraged to see that the Secretary-General has been\r\nsensitive to these concerns. From the start, h~ recognized the sources of\r\nconflict and war as being \"pervasive and deep\". In his own words:\r\n\"To reach them will require our utmost effort to enhance respect for\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, to promote sustainable economic\r\nand social development for wider prosperity, to alleviate distress and to\r\ncurtail the existence and use of massively destructive weapons.\"\r\n(A/47/277, para. 5)\r\nIn his regular report to the forcy-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly (A/47/1), the Secretary-General el~orates on the development\r\ndimension of people\u0027s aspirations in a way that is reassuring to the\r\ndeveloping countries. He states:\r\n\"It is clear that the Organization\u0027s responsibilities and commitments in\r\nthe political and security area should not be carried out at the expense\r\nof its responsibilities in the development field, and neither should be\r\nsubordinated to the other. It is essential that they be pursued in an\r\nintegrated, mutually supporting way.\" (A/47/!, para. 66)\r\nWe fully share the view of the Secretary-General.\r\nNext I would like to focus briefly on some of the more topical concepts\r\ncovered in the report: demucracy, human rights and the principles of the\r\nsovereign equality of States and non-interference in the internal affairs of\r\nStates. Tanzania welcomes the world-wide yearning for democracy within\r\nnations. Within our own borders we have been doing our part to enrich and\r\n---- ----~._-\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/471PV.47\r\n23\r\n(Mr. K~akyi, United Republic\r\nof Tanzania)\r\ndeepen our democracy. Yet we recogni3e that our experience is uniquely\r\nTanzanian. Democracy can never be viewed as a preserve of anyone nation or\r\ngroup of nations. Given the many different cultures and social and religious\r\nbeliefs embraced by peoples and nations around the world, it is not possible\r\nto have universal structures, forms and institutions of democracy. While all\r\nresponsible Governments and peoples throughout the world strive for more\r\ndemocracy, the tendency of some members of the international community to\r\nprescribe their structures and values as models of democracy for other States\r\nis unacceptable.\r\nJust as democracy is a sound foundation for peace and progress within\r\nnations, democracy between .~ations is a sound basis for the promotion of\r\ninternational peace and security and for the advancement of social and\r\neconomic progress. Nations should therefore promote it between themselves\r\nwith the zeal with which they promote it at the national level. We agree with\r\nthe Secret~ry-General\u0027sobservation that democracy within the family of\r\nnations means the application of its principles within the Organization itself\r\nand that this requires\r\n\"the fullest consultation, participation and engagement of all States,\r\nlarge and small, in th3 work of the Organization\". (~/47/277, para. 82)\r\nIt means helping to spread and promote the democratic ethic and culture within\r\nthe Organization and all international forums, especially those dealing with\r\nissues of critical importance to the majority of humanity.\r\nAt the national level, democracy has become a watchword of everyday\r\nusage. Hardly a day passes without our hearing it. At the global level, the\r\ncall for it has become more than muted. Talking about it today, one has\r\nalmost to apologize for disturbing the peace. Yet the call for a new\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n)J471PV.47\r\nM-25\r\n(Mr. Nyakyi« United Republic\r\n!Lf Tanzania)\r\ninternational economic order is essentially a ~all for the application of the\r\nprinciples of democracy in the management of the increasingly interdepandent\r\nworld economy. Democracy is incompatible with the inequities of the economic\r\norder established in the wake of the Second World War. A commitment to\r\ndemocracy at the national level that is not accompanied by a similar\r\ncommitment at the global level is less than adequate. As the\r\nSecretary-General correctly pointed out, an agenda that is intended to advance\r\nthe cause of democracy in our world today but that iqnores the glaring\r\ninequities of the present economic system will be an inadequate response to\r\nthe perverse and deep sources of conflict and war.\r\nEqually, we welcome the attention being paid increasingly to the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights. To say that a Government that does\r\nnot respect the basic human rights and fundamental freedoms of its people does\r\nnot deserve their loyalty and support is to state the obvious. However, the\r\nuniversal validity of these rights and freedoms does not give anyone country\r\nor group of countries the right to impose on others a unilateral\r\ninterpretation of their enjoyment O~ otherwise in other countries.\r\nIt is also important to 20int out that the basic provisions of the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights embody two mutually balancing aspects -\r\nthose which respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and\r\nthose which stipulate the obligations of the individual to society and the\r\nState. Equally, basic human rights extend to economic, social and cultural\r\nneeds, not just to civil and political needs. The tendency to address human\r\nrights selectively does a great disservice to the cause of their promotion and\r\nprotection.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI\r\nAl471PV.41\r\n26\r\n(Mr. Nyak:ri, Urdted Rep\\!J2lk\r\n2£ Tanzania)\r\nThroughout the report the Secretary-General recognizes the necessity of\r\nadhering strictly to the principles enshrined in Article 2, paragraphs 1, 3,\r\n4. and 7 of the Charter calling for respect for the sovereign e~ality of\r\nStates and strict adherence to the principle of non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of States. In our view, these principles should not be\r\ndiluted or abridged in any way. Yet the assurances have not fJucceeded in\r\ncompletely allaying the fears of many delegations, including mine. There is a\r\nneed for a careful study of the proposals touching on these provisions.\r\nMy final comments of a general nature relate to the provisions of the\r\nCharter, contained in Articles 10, 11, 13, 14 and 15, on the powers and\r\nfunctions of the General As~embly in the promotion and maintenance of\r\ni~ternational peace and security. These provisions make clear that the\r\nGeneral Assembly has an important role to play in the promotion and\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security; yet the General Assembly\r\nseldom exercises these powers. In the present climate favouring dialogue and\r\nnegotiations, every effort ~hould be made to encourage the Assembly to assume\r\nits responsibilities in th~s vital area of the work of the United Nations. To\r\nthis end, we warmly welcome the recommendations contained in paragraph 36 of\r\nthe report.\r\nI should now like to ~urn very briefly to some of the specific proposals\r\n\u00271\r\nand recommendations in the-report - those of particular interest to my\r\ndelegation and, I believe, to many small countries.\r\nThe first relates to :he concept of preventive deployment. We share the\r\nview expressed by many del~qations that these proposals need further study and\r\nelaboration. Preventive d9ployment is uncharted territory; it is a new\r\nI\r\nconcept not foreseen in th! Charter. Firstly, it envisages use of force\r\nE\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n(Mr. HYekYi, Upited Republic\r\nof TanzaniA)\r\nbefore the conditions set out in the Charter have been fulfilled. It seems to\r\ncall for the application of Chapter VII in circumstances in which the Charter\r\nrequires the application oflChapter VI. Secondly, its application runs the\r\nrisk of violating the prin~iple of sovereignty enshrined in Artiela 2,\r\nparagraph 7.\r\nIt is true that in cases of conflicts where the parties agree to\r\npreventive deployment thero is no such risk; difficulties could, however,\r\narise when the initiative comes from elsewhere. According to the proposal,\r\nthe question then becomes \u0027)ne of consent. The nature of that consent cmd the\r\nmanner in which it is obtained could raise issues of critical importance.\r\nA second area which relates to peacemaking and is of concern to my\r\ndelegation is the recommendation in paragraph 44 of the report regarding\r\nI\r\npeace-enforcement units. ~e report implies that if the forces anticipated in\r\nArticle 43 of the Charter were available there might not be a need for the\r\npeace-enforcement units of the kind contemplated in paragraph 44.\r\nWe welcome the readin~ss of some Member States to provide forces under\r\nthe proposal, but are uncomfortable because this entails a reinterpretation of\r\nthe Charter. We do not understand the rell::.:tance to provide them under\r\nArticle 43. Moreover, tha propoeal seems to my delegation to reverse the\r\norder of action intended in the Charter.\r\nIn our view, the proposal needs further study. In addition to\r\ni\r\nreconciling the proposal with the Charter, the study could also address the\r\n•\r\nreasons for the failure to implement Article 43. These concerns do not\r\ndiminish my d~legation\u0027s almiration for the Secretary-General\u0027s efforts to\r\nfind an urgent solution to the difficult problem which he has identified. We\r\nwill cooperate with all Me:war States in the search for a solution.\r\nI\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.47\r\n28\r\n(Mr. Nyakyi, United Republic\r\nof Tanzania)\r\nOur third area of concern is the proposal in paragraph 41 of the report\r\non the need for measures to alleviate the special economic problems faced by\r\ncountries as a result of complianco with mandatory Security Council\r\nsanctions. In our view the problem is essentially political; its soluti~n\r\nmust therefore be essentially political, not technical. We therefore fully\r\nsupport the Secretary-Genera1\u0027s proposal, and hope that the Security Council\r\nwill bear this consideration in mind.\r\nI do not wish to leave these areas of specific interest to my delegatio~\r\nwithout making it clear thnt there are many proposals in the rGport which\r\nenjoy my delegation\u0027s full support. Those focusing on preventive diplomacy,\r\nincluding confidence-building measures and fact-finding missions, enjoy our\r\nfull support. The need for a well-coordinated network of early-warning\r\nsystems is also self-evident if the capacity of the Organization to foresee\r\nand pre-empt conflicts is to be enhanced. The principle is agreed, although\r\nthe details will need to be worked out.\r\nIn the area of peacemaking, we are in accord with the general thrust of\r\nthe proposals regarding the role the International Court of Justice can play.\r\nThe same applies to internntional efforts to alleviate causes of conflict. We\r\nI\r\nare also in general agreenent with the recommendations relating to personnel\r\nand logistics in the area )f peace-keeping, and to those relating to\r\npost-conflict peace-building and safety of personnel.\r\nWe also share the view that regional organizations can play an important\r\nrole in the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nOn the financing of the Organization, we fully agree with the conclusion\r\nthe Secretary-General reaches in paragraph 72 that:\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/471PV.47\r\n29\r\n(Mr. NJ\u0027mi. United Republic\r\ngf T§Dzanla)\r\n\"Whatever decisions are taken on financing the Organization, there is one\r\ninesc\u0026pable necessity: Member States must pay their assessed\r\ncontributions in full and on time\". (A/47n77)\r\nBefore I concl~de, I ~hould like to go back to the important question of\r\nthe need to promote democrLcy more vigorously at the iaternational level. The\r\nneed for the reform of the United Nations has been generally recognized and\r\naccepted. Reforms of the General Assembly, the Er-onomic and Social Council\r\nand its subsidiary organs have already been undertaken.\r\nThe only major organ of the United Nations that remains unaffected by the\r\ndemands for reform is the S9curity Council. Yet nowhere in the United Nations\r\nis the need for democratic reforms felt more acutely than in the composition\r\nand functioning of the Council. As we were so eloquently\u0027 reminded by one\r\nspeaker at the Security Council summit meeting in January, the membership of\r\nthp. Council at the time of the founding of the United Nations in\r\n1945 represented 20 per cent of the membership. Today, with a membership of\r\n15, the Council represents only slightly more than 8 per cent of the\r\nmembership of the United Nations. The need for enlargement is as self-evident\r\nas the need for the abolition of the power of veto.\r\nThe case for abolition of the veto was clear even before the collapse of\r\nthe bipolar world. With the end of the cold war and the emergence of an\r\nenvironment favouring consensus, it is claimed that the veto is beginning to\r\nlook like an old, rusty weapon.\r\njustification for its rete~tion7\r\nTherefore, we ask: What is the\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/P\u0027l•.47\r\n30\r\n(Mr. liFlbL United Rerublic\r\nof Tanzania)\r\nThe Council\u0027s methods of lImrk also need reforming.. Its meetings are\r\ni.\r\nshrouded in too much aecracy. There is a great need for transparency in the\r\nwork of the Council. In the way it conducts its business, ~e Council hardly\r\ntakes account of the views of other Members of the United Nations; yet it is\r\nintended to ~~t on behalf of all Members and its decisions are bindihg on all.\r\nThe Council C\u0026nmot expect to continue to enjoy the confidence and support\r\nof the rest of the me3bership of the O~qanization if it continues to resist\r\ntheir legitimate calllc for reform. mdle some of the proposals may need time\r\nfor study and elaboration, others, such as those calling for t.ransparency and\r\na sense of particip\u0026.tion, need little more than a change of attitude .•\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.47\r\n31\r\n(Mr, Nyatyl.

This approach must surely apply to the procedure we\r\nshould use in considering ~e proposals in his report. A fragmented\r\napproach at this stage will hardly contribute to an integrated approach at\r\nthe implementation stage.\r\nMr. MUSUM (Zambia) z My delegation commends the timely\r\npreparation by the Secretary-General of his report \"An 1u1l9nda for Peace\",\r\nin response to the final statement of the Summit Meeting of the Security\r\nCouncil on 31 January this year.

For those reasons, the\r\nreport provides an invalu~.,le basis for. detailed discussion, further\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl41l1f\u0027:;~47\r\n32\r\n(Mr. Musuka, Zambia)\r\nconsideration and tho~cu9h examination by a working group of the General\r\nAssembly in which the ~ntire membership of the Orqanizatio~will be able to\r\nparticipate.\r\nZambia strongly supports the objective of strengthening and making more\r\nefficient, within the framework and provisions of the Charter, the capacity of\r\nthe United Nations for preve~tive diplomacy, for peacemaking and for\r\npeace-kespinq.\r\nMy delegation sharos ~e common conviction amonq nations that the end of\r\nthe cold war affords our O~ganization a historic opportunity to fulfil its\r\noriginal promise. The Uni~ed Nations is no longer crippled by the adversarial\r\nrelations that existed between the two super-Powers, and generally between\r\nEastern and Western Europe. On the contrary, the Organization has an\r\nunmatched opportunity to a~hiGve the noble objectives of the Charter, namely:\r\nto maintain international peace and security; to secure justice, human rights\r\nand fundamental freedoms; and to promote social progress and better standards\r\nof life in larger freedom. The United Nations may also rely on a virtually\r\nveto-free Security Council~ on the demonstrated desire of its membership to\r\ncooperate, and on the g~owing movement of democratic forces and more open\r\nforms of government.\r\nHowever, along with these opportunities and possibilities to fulfil its\r\noriginal promise, our Org~ization also confronts complex challenges in the\r\npost-cold-wa~ era. It faces the spread of violent ethnic, tribal, religious,\r\nsocial, cultural or linguis~ic strife, which challenges the unity and cohesion\r\nof States; it faces ecological damage and a growing threat of the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction; and it has to contend with\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.47\r\n33-35\r\n(Mr. Musuka. Zambia)\r\nnew and violent f01~s of racism. The United Nations is also obliged to face\r\nlong-deferred global problems, such as poverty, the debt burde~,\r\nprotectionism, declining commodity prices, drought, famine, drugs and the\r\never-widening gap between rich and poor nations.\r\nAll these challenges, new and old, pose real threats to peace, stability\r\nand security. Durable peare is not merely the absence of war. \"An Agenda for\r\nPeace\", in its comprehensive sense, must therefore encompass these\r\nnon-military threats. In partiCUlar, the United Nations should strengthen its\r\ncapacity to promote international economic relations based on equity and\r\ndemocratic principles. The injustice that exists in international economic\r\nrelations puts the developi~g countries at the mercy of the developed world.\r\nIt makes their development difficult; it compounds the poverty of their\r\npeoples, which destroys their human dignity and deprives them of their\r\npotential. Poverty does not promote the process of democratization. It is\r\neconomic and social progress which encourages and enhances democracy. The\r\nconduct of international economic relations on the basis of democratic\r\nprinciples is thus beneficial to the development and democratization of\r\ndeveloping countries; it is also an important means of promoting peace and\r\nprogress in the international community.\r\nThe Secretary-General rightly stresses the role of preventive diplomacy\r\nin easing tensions before they develop into conflicts, or if conflicts break\r\nout i~ containing them and resolving their underlying causes. We wish to\r\nunderscore the need to make the fullest and most effective use of preventive\r\ndiplomacy. All the peacef~11 means provided for under Chapter VI of the\r\nCharter must be exhausted ~efore resorting to enforcement measures under\r\nChapter VII.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/471PV.47\r\n36\r\n(Mr. Musuka. Zambia)\r\nFor preventive diplomacy to be effective, the Secretary-General shnuld be\r\nprovided with the necessary measures to create confidence, as well as the\r\nmeans to evaluate situations before they break out into conflicts. The roles\r\nof the General Assembly and of regional organizations should also be\r\nemphasized. Greater use should be made of the International Court of Justice;\r\nthe Secretary-General should also be authorized to seek advisory opinions from\r\nthe World Court.\r\nIn the past, many delegations have examined the roles of the Security\r\nCouncil, the General Assembly and the Secretary-General in the maintenance of\r\npeace and security. Experience has now demonstrated the need to strengthen\r\nthe Assembly\u0027s role in this important function, in accordance with Article 14\r\nof the Charter. My delegation would also lik~ to stress the importance of\r\nmaintaining the relationship between the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil as defined in the _-elevant provisions of the Charter.\r\nWe are gratified to note that the Security Council is now exercising more\r\neffectively its yrimary responsibility in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. In that regard, it is important to caution that\r\nmembership on the Council entails special and solemn responsibilities. These\r\nresponsibilities must not be abused or exercised Qn the basis of narrow\r\nnational or group interests. The Council should not serve as an instrument\r\nfor imposing the will of the powerful upon the weak. It must consistently\r\nstrive to serve the interests of all States without discrimination or\r\nI\r\nselectivity. There is also need for greater consultation and coordination\r\nbetween the Security Council and the General Assembly in the ma.\u0027.ntenance of\r\ninternational peace and se:urity.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.47\r\n37\r\n(~usuka, Zambia)\r\nMy delegation shares \u0027-he Secretary General\u0027 s view that\r\n\"the principles of the Charter must be applied consistently, not\r\nselectively, for if the perception should be of the latter~ t~ust will\r\nwane and with it the moral authority which is the greatest and most\r\nunique quality of that instrument.\" (A/47/277, para, 82)\r\nSo that the United Nations may respond quickly to situations threatening\r\ninternational peace and security, it is imperative that Member States agree to\r\nplace a permanent military force at the disposal of the Security Council.\r\nThis matter requires the serious consideration of this Assembly. Such an\r\nagreement would, without dnubt, impose great financial burdens on Members;\r\nhowever, peacemaking and peace-keeping operations necessarily entail onerous\r\nfinancial commitments.\r\nThe arrangement would ensure that such forces are deployed only under the\r\ncommand of the United Nations, in order that the Organization not be used\r\nmerely to legitimate actions of individual Governments motivated purei~ by\r\ntheir own national interests. We believe that the United Nations would strive\r\nto act respon\u0026ibly and without selectivity in invoking enforcement measures.\r\nThese conditions are important if we are to maintain the efficacy and\r\ncredibility of this world body.\r\nI\r\nTo ensure that the interests of small and economically weak States are\r\nprotected and their views :aken into account on important decisions affecting\r\ninternational relations, the reforms we undertake must be based on respect for\r\nthe cardinal principles of sovereignty, sovereign equality, non-intervention\r\nand the territorial integrity of States.\r\nPeacemaking and peace-keeping are important functions of the United\r\nNations. In this new era, peace-keeping operations are not limited to war\r\nsituations but also involve the monitoring of elections.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl411PV.47\r\n38-40\r\n(Mr. Musuka, Zambia)\r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027sreport \"An Agellda for Peace\" provides a wealth of\r\ninformation that should se~~e as a basis for further consideration of the\r\nchanqes we seek it is important that the task be entrusted to an open-ended\r\nworking group, which should submit its report to the General Assembly at its\r\nforty-eighth session.\r\nThe world is today at the threshold of a new era characterized by\r\nuncertainties, requiring serious reflection on the part of Member States.\r\nIndeed, we are at a crossroads, and our resolve and commitment are needed more\r\nthan ever before. We need the commitment of all in order to take the bold\r\ndecisions necessary to make the United Nations more responsive to the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nW471PV.47\r\n41\r\nMr. lWRQMA (Sierra Leone): The Sierra Leone delegation is of the\r\nview that efforts and proposals such as those contained in the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027 5 report \"An Agenda for Peace\" and his report on the work of\r\nthe Orqanization must be predicated on the Charter. Indeed, the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter - the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, the achievement of international cooperation in solvinq\r\ninternational problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian\r\ncharacter, the sovereign equality of States, the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes between States, and the ~on-use or threat of force against the\r\nterritorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any manner\r\ninconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations Charter - remain as valid\r\ntoday as when first enunciated some 47 years ago.\r\nThe Secretary-General is therefore to be commended for the realistic\r\nposition he has taken throughout his reports~ The proposals of preventive\r\ndiplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping, post-conflict peace-building would, if\r\nimplemented, qo a lonq way towards creating a safer world for its peoples.\r\nThese proposals, when coupled with the other modes of settlelnent of disputes\r\nset out in the Charter - negotiations, mediation, conciliation, ar~itration\r\nand judicial settlement of disputes through the International Court of\r\nJustice - should provide an appropriate framework for the solution and\r\nelimination of the inter-State conflicts that presently afflict the world.\r\nAt a time when it was considered unrealistic because of the cold war to\r\ncall for implementation of the collective security provisions of the Charter\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security, at a time when\r\nStates\u0027 habit of resorting to force was becoming all too frequent. The\r\nGovernment of Sierra Leone had called on this Organization to implement\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/471PV.47\r\n42\r\n(Mr. KQroma. Sierra Leone)\r\nthe collective security provisions of the Charter for the maintenaco of\r\ninternational peace and security. It is therefore understandable that the\r\nSierra Leone delegation should wolcome the Secretary-General\u0027s call for armed\r\nforces to be made available to the United Nations, both on an ad hoc and on a\r\npermanent basis, to be deployed as and whenever necessary for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security. However, such forces, or indeed any\r\nenforcement measure, must not be seen to be undertaken selectively or to serve\r\nnarrow national or group interests.\r\nIn a similar vein, the Sierra Leone delegation supports the\r\nrecommendation for the creation of peace enforcement units of t~ained\r\nvolunteer forces, to be deployed as a provisional measure in clearly defined\r\ncircumstances. The recommendation of pea~3-buildin9\u0027 in the form of the\r\nremoval of land-mines, development of agricultu1~, improvement of\r\ntransportation and utilization of resources, finds favour with my delegation\r\nas well. As in the past, the Government of Sierra Leone stands ready to make\r\nits contribution to the peace-keeping efforts of this Organization.\r\nWhile regional arrangements have a role to play in the scheme of dispute\r\nsettlement or the provisioA of humanitarian assistance, the Sierra Leone\r\ndelegation is of the view that in our efforts to promote international peace\r\nand security we must guard against regionalizing the world. Although, the\r\nUnited Nations remains, in our view, the pre-eminent body for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security, not all regional organizations are\r\nendowed with the material and other resources for peace-keeping. Hence, if\r\nthose organizations are to play a meaningful ~ole and help attain the\r\nI\r\nobjective of maintaining regional peace and security, the United Nations will\r\nhave to provide them with ~he necessary support and assistance.\r\n•\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.47\r\n43\r\n(Mr. Koroma, Sierra Leone)\r\nThe Secretary-General also addressed that other prerequisite for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security: elimination of abject\r\npoverty among the majority of the world\u0027s population and promotion of economic\r\nand social development through international cooperation. As pointed out in\r\nhis rep~rt, new conflicts should not overshadow existing problems of unchecked\r\npopulation growth; crushing debt problems; drug-trafficking, which threatens\r\nthe integrity of some small States; poverty, famine and disease. Drought and\r\ndisease, the Secretary-General reminded us, can decimate no less mercilessly\r\nthan weapons of war; hence the obligation of this Organization to address the\r\nroot causes ()f economic decline and under-development in most African\r\ncountries. The United Nations must intensify and further internationalize the\r\ndevelopment process in Africa. My delegation therefore firmly supports the\r\nrecommendation for a reinvigorated Economic and Social Council.\r\nMy delegation also welcomes the Secretary-General\u0027s reaffirmation that\r\nthe foundation of the United Nations is and must remain the State. Respect\r\nfor the fundamental sovereignty and integrity o~ the State is crucial to any\r\ncommon international progress. However, my delegation is of the view that the\r\nprinciples of sovereignty and non-interference do not absolve national\r\ngovernments or their agents of responsibility for tyrannizing their\r\npopulations or engaging in massive violation of their human rights. When a\r\npopulation is being held hostage by unrepresentative agents and has to endure\r\nenormous suffering as a result, this Organization has the duty and the\r\nobligation to come to its rescue and save it from continued suffering.\r\nIt should not be forgotten that, just as the United Nations Charter\r\nitself addresses peoples and not governments, this Organization, representing\r\nas it does the collective conscience of mankind, should not neglect the\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.47\r\n44-45\r\n(Mr. xoroma, Sierra Leone)\r\ninterests of its fundamental constituents. However, such matters are better\r\ndetermined by the General Assembly than by the Security Council alone. In\r\nthis way, the confidence and impartiality of such decis~ons cannot be\r\nobjectively assailed or impugned, even by those to whom they are directly\r\naddressed. In this connection, all organs of the United Nations, particularly\r\nthe General Assembly, should be seen to be playing their rightful role, not\r\nonly to democratize international relations, but also to provide the political\r\nand moral authority necessary to make United Nations decisions acceptable even\r\nby those to whom they are directly addressed.\r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s proposals are remarkable and far-reaching; yet\r\nthey are based on realism. They also constitute a firm foundation for the\r\nlong-term peace of the world. If implemented, they would go a long way, not\r\nonly towards strengthening the United Nations itself but also towards helping\r\nit to achieve its twin objectives~ the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity and the promotion of cooperation for the socio-economic development\r\nof the majority of its membership. We therefore commend the Secretary-General\r\non his report and encourage him to continue in this direction.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/471PV.47\r\n46\r\n~YAACQBI (Israel): At the outset, I would like to congratulate\r\nthe President of the General Assembly. We know of his leadership both in his\r\nhome country and here at the United Nations, and we are confident that he will\r\nbe successful in guiding the current session of the General Assembly.\r\nThis is my first address here in the General Assembly. I would like to\r\ngreet everyone - the President, the Vice-Presidents, the Secretary-General,\r\nand the representatives of all Member States - with the traditional Israeli\r\ngreeting of shalom, which means peace.\r\nThe principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations speak\r\neloquently of the determination\r\n\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war ••• to reaffirm\r\nfaith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human\r\nperson, in the equal rights of men and women and of nation3 to\r\npractice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good\r\nneighbours, and to unite our strength to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity ••• and to employ international machinery for the promotion of\r\nthe economic and social advan~ement of all peoples \"\r\nEvents in the world today present us with many challenges, and we must\r\naddress the following questions courageously: Are the words of the Charter\r\nmerely words, words, words? Is it our duty to stop the killing in Bosnia? To\r\nhalt terrorism? To enhance democracies rather than totalitarian regimes? To\r\nfree the world from hunger? To put it simply, are we truly committed to\r\ncarrying out the Charter of the United Nations?\r\nIf the answer is no, then we must confront the question posed by the\r\nGreek orator Demosthenes: \"What greater crime can an orator be charged with\r\nthan that his opinions and his language are not the same?\"\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/471PV.47\r\n47\r\n(Mr. YaacObi, Israel)\r\nThe Secretary-Genlnal\u0027s report, \"An Agenda for Peace\", is a courageous\r\nproposal truly to 9rapple with our commitment to peace and freedom, as it was\r\nset out in the Charter. On behalf of the Government of Israel, I would like\r\nto express our profound appreciation for the Secretary-General\u0027s enlightening\r\nreport. It provides an intriguing and comprehensive basis for significant\r\ndiscussion about the future direction of the United Nations.\r\nIsrael is ready and willing to take an active part in creating a new\r\npolitical environment. As Foreign Minister Shimon Peres stated before this\r\nAssembly on 1 October 1992,\r\n\"The United Nations was established in an era that no longer\r\n. exists. Yet its ideals and structures can meet the challenges and\r\ndangers of this new age. We support the \u0027Agenda for Peace\u0027 offered by\r\nthe Secretary-General\". (A/47/PV. 20, pt 46)\r\nA new reality has emerged in the global arena, and we must address it.\r\nNo longer is this Organization shackled by the chains of super-Power rivalry.\r\nWith the end of the cold war, a new kind of United N~tions is being formed and\r\nmoulded. The United Nations must now be a leading force, based on agreement\r\namong Member States that the only escape from hunger, from misery and from\r\nbloodshed is peaceful, cultured relations among peoples and nations. That was\r\nthe vision of the biblical prophets, and that is what is needed for the third\r\nmillennium, which is at our doorstep.\r\nAs we seek to construct a brighter future, it is imperative that we be\r\nguided by the light of peace and democracy. Many States are putting their\r\nresources, their human energies and their creativity to waste by continuing to\r\npursue military and other types of conflict. If all those resources were\r\ninstead devoted to investment in human capital and economic development, we\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/471PV.47\r\n48\r\n(Mr. Yaacobi, Israel)\r\ncould be improvinq lives rather than ending them. If we invest in health,\r\neducation and science instead of military hardware v then within one qeneration\r\nmankind could be free from hunger and illiteracy. The choice before us is\r\nbetween a barren future and a better future.\r\nThe other key to mankind\u0027s progress is democracy: the participation of\r\npeople in defining their own lives and their own future. Without democracy\r\nthere cannot be an environment ·of human rights. It is a fallacy to think that\r\nhuman rights can be safeguarded by totali~ariari regimes and military\r\ndictatorships.\r\nDomocracy is an essential component of maintaining peaceful relations\r\namong States. The existence of democratic Government is the central guarantee\r\nfor preventing a policy of violence and aggression. Never has one democracy\r\ndeclared war upon another democracy. That is not the result of chance;\r\nrather, it is the result of the nature of democracies. Therefore,\r\ndemocratization is not just a political and moral issue; rather it is directly\r\ntied to the existence of peace and stability.\r\nPeace and democracy are the keys to a better world. This must be stated\r\nfirmly and clearly. It is the basic and solid truth, and all of us must\r\nacknowledge it.\r\nThe Middle East might be called the land of lost opportunities. Lost\r\nopportunities have carried a very heavy and painful price for the peoples of\r\nthe Middle East. Now we have a historic opportunity to change the situation;\r\nto create a new and better future for all of us; to replace tension with\r\neconomic development, war with peace, and rearmament with investment in human\r\nresources.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.47\r\n49-50\r\n(Mr. YaacObi, Israel)\r\nEgypt and Israel have so far been the only countries in the Middle East\r\nthat have courageously not missed an opportunity for peace. Now,. a new window\r\nof opportunity has bea~ opened. Bilateral negotiations are currently being\r\nheld between Israel and the neighbouring Arab States and the Palestinians. We\r\nhope that these negotiations will lead to peace treaties, and we hope that\r\nSyria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians, and Israel, will not miss this\r\nhistoric moment.\r\nIn the light of recent events, I call for an end to provocative acts of\r\nviolence by extremists. We cannot afford to allow them to murder the\r\nprospects for peace.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.47\r\n51\r\n(Mr. Yaacobi. Israel)\r\nMay I assure the Assembly that no provocation will divert Israel from the\r\npeace track. But Israel stands by its right to defend its citizens with its\r\nfull force and authority.\r\nThe bilateral tulks, as well as the multilateral negotiations, have\r\ncreated a new dynamic with good prospects. If there is a breakthrough towards\r\npeace between Israel and Syria, this will be the engine which will lead to a\r\nchange in the face of the entire Middle East. Even if this does not occur,\r\nthe train will have to go on. We shall not allow the steam to go with the\r\nwind.\r\nAn important and encouraging development, even revolutionary in the\r\nhistory of nations in the Middle East, is the growing awareness of the\r\ninterdependence among peace, economic development and well-being.\r\nPeace is therefore likely to be a great lever for regional economic\r\ndevelopment. The United Nations, the United States, Russia, the Europeans,\r\nCanada, Japan and others can mobilize their expertise and resources in\r\nnumerous fields, including the establishment of a Middle East development\r\nbank. A peaceful environment could free up $30 billion annually from the cost\r\nof defence for progr~s~ and development. Moreover, it will also gradually\r\nallow movement in six major new directions: the establishment of a Middle\r\nEastern common market; the creation of joint ventures, based upon integrated\r\nknowledge, capital and mineral resources from both inside and outside the\r\nregion; the establishment of an integrated network of infrastructure for\r\nports, airports, railways and energy plants; the opening of borders for\r\ntourism; the promotion of cooperation in the fields of health, professional\r\ntraining, knowledge, technology and agriculture; and the removal of all sorts\r\nof boycotts.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.41\r\n52\r\n(~aacobi, Isr.ael)\r\nOnly when the guns fall silent and the pe~ples of the ~egion are able to\r\ndevote thems\u0026lves to i..mp~OViIi9 d1eir quality of life rather than to military\r\nconfrontation and futile hatred will the Middle East once again become a\r\ncradle of civilization. At stu.e are the very li\u0027iTes and well-beinq of\r\nh\u0027Uldreds of millions of people. At sta.\"t6 is the future of all of us.\r\nPeace and democracy are the key elements to mankind\u0027s future progress.\r\nThat being the case, I should like to raise the idea of initiating two task\r\nforces under the authority of the Secretary-General. One task force would be\r\ndevoted to enc~araqinq democratization through education about democracy and\r\nfree elections. The goal of this United ~ations task force on democracy would\r\nbe to create a new st~te of mind regarding the imPortance of democracy for\r\nensuring human rights. and for improving\u0027 the quality of life of people. The\r\nsecond propo~ed task force would seet ~o initiate regional cooper~tion in\r\ndifferent parts of the world. It might be based upon the experience of the\r\nEuropean Community and other reg~cnal frameworks for cooperation. Regional\r\ncooperation is necessary to enhance the ability of developing countries to\r\ncope with the more developed ana wealthier countries of the world.\r\nAll qreat achievements in human history were dreams before they became\r\nrealities. Our taok as statesmen is to translate the dreams into reality.\r\nDavid Ben-Gurion, the founder and first leader of my country, said, \"Israel\u0027s\r\nfuture will be determined by its righteousness and strength\". With regard to\r\nthis Assembly, I should like to state that our ability to fulfil our duty will\r\nbe determined by our righteousness, strength and dedication to the vision and\r\ncause of peace.\r\nMr. YOa (Republic ot Korea): The United Nations has reached a\r\ncrucial stage in its evolution. Today innovative and comprehensive measures\r\nI\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI\r\nS3\r\n(Mr. Yoo. Republic o£ Korea)\r\nare required in order for the Organization to adapt to its complex\r\nresponsibilities of the post-cold-var era. As previous speakers have\r\nGloquently noted, the Secretary-General, by submitting the report entitled \"An\r\nAgenda for Peace\" has effectively iuitiated discussions regarding the ability\r\nof the United Nations to ensure global peace and security. Our discussion\r\ntoday represen~5 one essential step in advancing the dialogue necessary for\r\nfuture decisions, and thus my delegation would like to take this opportunity\r\n~o touch on some of the proposals contained in the report.\r\nWith regard to preventiVe diplomacy there is widespread agreement among\r\nMembers that the timely collection of information through formal or informal\r\nfact-finding missions can greatly contribute to the ability of t~e United\r\nNations to ease tensions before they result in conflict. In the light of the\r\noverwhelming costs associated with efforts to resolve conflicts after they\r\nhave begun, the concept of preventive diplomacy merits the full support of\r\nMember States.\r\nIn this regard my delegation commends the endeavours of the\r\nSecretary-General over the past year and hopes to see his fact-finding role\r\nstrengthened. At the same time, we believe that certain aspects of the United\r\nNations role in preventive diplomacy need further clarification and\r\nelaboration. For example, the question of securing the consent of the parties\r\ninvolved prior to the dispatch of United Nations-authorized fact-finding\r\nmissions should be thoroughly examined and decisions should be made only after\r\nall possible implications have been considered.\r\nRegarding the issues related to preventive diplomacy, my delegation\r\n~~coqnizes the usefulness of preventive deployment. A United Nations presence\r\nQ~ployed in a timely fashioA with a clearly defined mandate from the Security\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.47\r\n54-55\r\n(Mr. Yoo, Republic of Korea)\r\nCouncil could help deter the escalation of conflict. My delegation, however,\r\nfeels that the question of preventive deployment without the consent of all\r\nparties involved in a potential inter-State dispute needs further study.\r\nProblems arising from the possible erosion of the neutrality of the United\r\nNations could offset the gains to be expected from such preventive deployment.\r\nMy delegation is also concerned with the logistical implications of this\r\nproposal, as the introduction of preventive deployment will inevitably\r\nincrease the damand for the already over-extended financial and human\r\nresources of the United Nations. We look forward to discussing this point\r\nalong with the merits and the feasibility of preventive deployment.\r\nThe report\u0027s focus on peacemaking represents a new and important\r\ndirection for the Organization. My delegation believes that the provisions of\r\nthe Charter on the peaceful settlement of disputes should act as the principal\r\nquidelines for our collective efforts in resolving conflicts. We also find\r\nthe proposals for a reinforced role for the International Court of Justice to\r\nbe noteworthy. Indeed, the recent conclusion of the long-standing boundary\r\ndispute between Honduras and El Salvador should set a good precedent for the\r\nrole of the World Court in resolving international disputes.\r\nI\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI Al47/PV.47\r\n56\r\n(Mr. Yoo, Republic of Korea)\r\nThe report also touches upon the right of States to consult the Security\r\nCouncil on special economic problems resulting from compliance with United\r\nNations authorized sanctions, as provided for in Article 50 of the Charter.\r\nIn practice, however, the economic consequences arising from the imposition of\r\nsanctions under Article 41 of the Charter have not been adequately addressed.\r\nMy delegation joins the previous speakers who stressed the need for measures\r\nto alleviate such economic difficulties.\r\nBefore leaving the topic of peacemaking, I should like to address the\r\nproposals regarding peace-Gnfo~carnGntunits. Recent events in the former\r\nYugoslavia and Cambodia have demonstrated the need to ensure full compliance\r\nwith cease-fire agreements. Clearly, an enhanced ability on the part of the\r\nUnited Nations to provide for or realize such compliance would contribute\r\npositively to its credibility. However, various questions must be answered\r\nbefore the Organization proceeds with any plans to establish peace-enforcement\r\nunits. For example, to what. extent will United Nations forces be expected to\r\nengage in military enforcement activities? Are Member States ready to make\r\navailable a sufficient level of troop strength? How could we determine in\r\nadvance which type of force - peace-enforcement or peace-keeping - would be\r\nneeded in a particular situation? My delegation believes that these and other\r\nquestions merit careful considerati,on by the United Nations membership.\r\nIn the area of peace-~eeping, the expansion in both scale and scope of\r\nUnited Nations peace-keepi4g operations calls for increasing participation by\r\nMember States. For our part, the Republic of Korea has recently completed the\r\nI\r\nquestionnaire on peace-keeping, and has indicated the areas in which it is\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.47\r\n57\r\n(Mr. Yoo, Republic of Korea)\r\nprepared to contribute to peace-keeping ope~ations. As a new participant, my\r\ncountry can appreciate the need for a training programme for\r\npeace-keeping-operations personnel, and thus supports the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nrecommendations on this subject. We look forward to seeing an extensive\r\ntraining programme established under the aegis of the United Nations.\r\nThe financial difficuLties faced by the United Nations may prevent it\r\nfrom effectively carrying out its many duties in the future. Indeed, the need\r\nfor an urgent solution is widely recognized, and to this end, the Member\r\nStates should make it a to~ priority to pay their assessed contributions as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\nIn the area of peace-keeping, given the increasing scope of operations,\r\nthe United Nations cannot be expected to achieve its goals unless it is\r\nprovided with adequate financing. The Organization must be able not only to\r\ncover operational costs but also to allocate funds and logistical equipment\r\nquickly so that operations ~an be carried out in a timely manner. When days\r\ncan make the precious difference between life and death, clearly the United\r\nNations can no longer affo\u0027~d the luxury of protracted procedures.\r\nA number of interesting proposals have been put forward to address the\r\nfinancing of peace-keeping operations, which we believe deserve careful study\r\nby Member States. To facilitate the Organization\u0027s peace-keeping function,\r\nespecially at the crucial start-up phase, my delegation supports the\r\nestablishment of a revolving fund for peace-keeping operations. In this\r\nregard, the recent proposal made by Japan to establish a new component in the\r\nworking capital fund for p~ace-keeping operations has provided a good basis\r\nfor constructive discussioll.\r\n. ••. -6. ...... ._. ~ •\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.47\r\n58\r\n(Mr. Yoo, Republic of Korea)\r\nRegarding the proposal for changes in the current special scale of\r\nassessment for peace-keeping operations# my delegation is of the view that\r\nuntil and unless there emerges a consensus for a new format, it would be\r\ndesirable to maintain the present scale.\r\nThe Security Council has been the focus of much discussion in recent\r\nyears, primarily due to the expanded scope of activities made possible by the\r\nend of the cold war. The Republic of Korea fully supports the heightened role\r\nof the Council in maintaining global peace and security. Given the\r\nimplications that Security Council resolutions have for the entire membership,\r\nit may better serve the international community to make consultations more\r\ntransparent. Instituting a mechanism for the Council to hear opinions of the\r\nbroadest possible range of Member States will help secure great support for\r\nits decisions. We hope th~t the Council will continue to discharge its\r\nimportant responsibilities effectively, harmonizing the need for efficiency\r\nand democratization.\r\nThe impetus provided by the Security Council meeting of Heads of State or\r\nGovernment on 31 January continues to have reverberations to this very day.\r\nWe must not lose the momentum provided by that meeting, but more importantly,\r\nwe must now generate new momentum with the participation of the whole\r\nmembership of the United Nations to actually implement the reforms that are\r\nbeing elaborated by Member States. We hope that this pivotal moment in the\r\nhistory of the United Natic.ns will someday be remembered as the rebirth of the\r\nOrganization and the begillling of a new era based on multilateral cooperation.\r\nMr. PIBULSONGGRNi (Thailand): History is continually being shaped\r\nby dramatic and rapid developments in international relations. The\r\nideological barrier that had threatened international peace and security has\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.4?\r\n59-60\r\n(Mr. Pibulsonggraroc Thailand)\r\ncollapsed, while the trend towards dialogue and cooperation at both regional\r\nand international levels has been enhanced. A new world order of consensus\r\nand global partnership has seemingly dawned.\r\nThis new world order requires not simply economic, political or cultural\r\ncooperation. Rather it in fact demands international cooperative exchange at\r\nall levels and in all fields. Let us refer to this new order as a new United\r\nNations order in which all nations must come together as one to form a genuine\r\ninternational community.\r\nWhile this new world ~rder has initiated renewed hope and con~dence in\r\nthe Organization\u0027s ability to function as an arbiter for international peace\r\nand security, it is all too, apparent that the task faced by the United Nations\r\nhas become increasingly complex as more and greater demands are placed on the\r\nOrganization. Peace is no longer satisfactory if it merely means an absence\r\nof war. Peace will prevail only when nation-States have achieved their\r\npolitical stability, economic prosperity and social harmony.\r\nThe United Nations mU$.t be revitalized if it is to be able to meet more\r\nI\r\neffectively the demands of today and the expectations of tomorrow.\r\nMy delegation therefore welcomes the timely initiative taken by the\r\nSecurity Council summit meeting last January and wishes to commend the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s efforts in preparing his excellent and comprehensive\r\nreport. entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\". We fully agree that the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping, as well\r\nas post-conflict peace-bui~ding, should be comprehensively strengthened within\r\nthe framework and the provisions of the Charter.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.47\r\n61\r\n(Mr. Pibulsonggram, ~hailand)\r\nI should now like to comment on some very important issues raised by the\r\nSecretary-General, which I believe must be considered thoroughly. First, my\r\ndelegation concurs with the Secretary-General\u0027s observation that:\r\n\"The foundation-stone of [the work of the United Nations] is and\r\nmust remain the State.\" (A/47/277, para. 17)\r\nRespect for the sovereignty and integrity of States is therefore vital in any\r\ncommon international undertaking. However, the complex tasks now faced by the\r\nOrganization require as a consequence full cooperation from its Member\r\nStates. Member States should therefore seek measures that will help\r\nfacilitate the work of the Organization.\r\nOn the question of preventive diplomacy, my delegation recognizes that\r\nthe ability of the United Nations to perform its tasks effectively depends on\r\nthe timely availability of accurate information. The Secretary-General\u0027s use\r\nof fact-finding missions is therefore essential. My delegation would like to\r\nsee careful consideration given to the Secretary-General\u0027s recommendation that\r\nUnited Nations observers be sent to areas of potential conflict at the request\r\nof Member States to prevent any outbreak of hostilities. We feel that \u0027~ere\r\nis a need for greater clarity regarding the scope of this innovative proposal\r\nand the circumstances under which it would be implemented, because this idea\r\ngoes beyond the traditional principle of United Nations peace-keeping\r\noperations and, as several delegations have already mentioned, may well\r\njeopardize the neutrality of the United Nations.\r\nThe United Nations role as peacemaker has been embodied in the spirit of\r\nthe Organization from the very beginning, as envisioned in Chapter VI of the\r\nCharter. My delegation therefore supports the Secretary-General\u0027s efforts to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations role in this field. To achieve this objective,\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.47\r\n62\r\n(Mr. Pibulsonggram, Thailand)\r\nwe believe, there is a need for greater communication and closer cooperation\r\nbetween the Security Council, ~e General AssarUbly and ths Secretary-General.\r\nTransparency in the Security Council\u0027s decision-making process and effective\r\nconsultation with regional organizations and Member States would greatly help\r\ntowards this end.\r\nMy delegation is fully aware of the economic difficulties often caused\r\nfor third countries by the imposition of sanctions under Chapter VII. We\r\nshare the Secretary-General\u0027s view that those States should have the right to\r\nconsult the Security Council. The Council should also devise a set of\r\nmeasures, involving the financial institutions of the United Nations system,\r\nto help insulate States from such difficulties.\r\nLet me now turn to the question of peace-keeping operations. With new\r\nand troubling conflicts this year, we have seen a major increase in United\r\nNations peace-keeping and peacemaking activities, such as the United Nations\r\nProtection Force in the former Yugoslavia and the United Nations Operation in\r\nSomalia, to name but two. As we speak, there are reports of renewed conflict\r\nin southern Lebanon. This increase in the number of operations has been\r\naccompanied by an increase in complexity both in components and in goals.\r\nUnited Nations peace-keepers now include soldiers, police, civilian\r\nadministrators, diplomats, engineers and poll watchers. Although\r\npeace-keeping operations continue to monitor ceasefires, much more is now\r\nexpected.\r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s proposal to establish a United Nations stand-by\r\nforce thus deserves serious consideration. Situations are not only\r\nforeseeable, but have actually occurred, wherein forces and other personnel\r\nresources are needed at very short notice. To meet such a need, Member States\r\nI\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI\r\nA/471PV.47\r\n63\r\n(Mr, PibulsoXlggram, Thailand)\r\nmight be asked to earmark certain military forces that could be deployed for\r\npeace-keepinq gpe~ations.\r\nWe can see that much of the success of all peace-keeping activities\r\ndepends on the prior training of personnel, The need for a uniform standard\r\nof logistic procedures is self-evident. The Secretariat might designate a\r\nfocal point for training activities. Regional and national training centres\r\nmight be established, with the possibility of an annual peace-keeping\r\nfellowship programme in order to provide an additional opportunity for States\r\nto train their personnel.\r\nThailand always stands ready to be of service to the United Nations in\r\nits important peace-keeping role. In the past we have participated in several\r\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations, such as the United Nations Transition\r\nAssistance Group in Namibia ,and the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation\r\nMission. We also sent 50 military personnel to join the United Nations guard\r\ncontingent in Iraq. Closer to home, Thailand has rendered its full support to\r\nthe United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC).\r\nAt the request of the Secretary-General, this year my Government\r\ndispatched an engineer battalion to serve under UNTAC in Cambodia. In light\r\nof the election scheduled to be held under UNTAC supervision in May next year,\r\n.\r\nthe task of the Thai battalion is not only important and urgent, but dangerous\r\nas well. It is mandated to clear mines and to help prepare the Cambodian\r\ninfrastructure. These actilities will help prepare the groundwork for the\r\noperations of UNTAC and the repatriation of more than 370,000 displaced\r\npersons who had sought refuge in Thailand. In addition, Thailand dispatched\r\n15 military and military police personnel to serve at UNTAC Headquarters in\r\nPhnom Penh. Thai territory has also been used as a staging area for the\r\noperations of UNTAC.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI\r\nA/47/FV.4i\r\n64-65\r\n(Mr. Pibulsonggrarn. Thailand)\r\nIt is our firm belief that the United Nations peace-keeping operations\r\nare too vital to the maintenance of world peace to remain hostage to financial\r\nand budgetary restrictions. While monthly expenditures for all peace-keeping\r\noperations amount to approximately $220 million, unpaid contributions to these\r\noperations remain high - well over $600 million. The key to solving this\r\nintractable problem still lies in Member States\u0027 paying their asse~sed\r\ncontributions in full and on time. Since this is not possible, for a variety\r\nof reasons, ranging from inability to pay through delays caused by different\r\nnational bUdgetary systems to unwillingness to pay, we welcome the\r\nSecretary-Generalis bold and innovative proposal to establish a temporary\r\npeace-keeping reserve fund of $50 million as a means to alleviate the\r\nfinancial problems, in particular the start-up cost of peace-keeping\r\noperations.\r\nMy delegation also welcomes the Secretary-General\u0027s other proposals,\r\nv~ich aim at creating a ~ound and stable financial basis for future\r\noperations, such as the peace endowment fund. We agree that such a fund can\r\nbe created by a combination of assessed and voluntary contributions, with the\r\nlatter being sought not only from Governments, but from the private sector and\r\nindividu\u0026ls as well. Other contributions in kind from the private sector,\r\nsuch as vehicles or equipment, should also be considered.\r\nI\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI Af47;PV.47\r\n66\r\n(Mr. Pibulsonggram, Thailand)\r\nMy delegation wishes co emphasize our belief that the financing of\r\npeace-keeping operations is a matter of the collective responsibility of all\r\nMember States. What better way to show our commitment to the Organization\r\nthan by paying our contributions in full and on time?\r\nAt a time when the eyes of the world are on the United Nations as the\r\nbest hope for the maintenance of international peace and security, the\r\nSecretary-Gene~al\u0027s report is timely. My delegation is prepared to take part\r\nin the examination and consideration of the ideas and proposals contained in\r\nhis report. We therefore think that the establishment of an open-ended\r\nworking group, as proposed by several delegations, would be most useful. It\r\nwould provide a forum for all Member States and the relevant organs of the\r\nUnited Nations to consider this document, which is of fundamental importance\r\nto the Organization, and to make their respective contributions to any new\r\ndirection the United Nations may take.\r\nAs I said at the beqinning of my statement, international events have\r\nshown the United Nations to be a vital instrument for the maintenance and\r\nenhancement of international peace and security. We have been following\r\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali\u0027s first year in office with keen\r\ninterest and admiration. He has our full support in his attempts to reform\r\nand to revitalize this Organization so that it may better serve mankind as a\r\nnew millennium approaches.\r\nI can find no words that can better prescribe what we must do together\r\nthan those so eloquently said by the Secretary-General himself:\r\n\"Yesterday\u0027s conflicts are no longer today\u0027s conflict. Let us join hands\r\nto prevent today\u0027s conflicts from becoming tomorrow\u0027s conflicts.\"\r\nThese are words that we should all heed.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n------------\r\nAl471PV.47\r\n67\r\nI\r\nMr. DIAW (Mali) (interpretation from French): My c1ele9a~ion\r\nwelcomes this opportunity to speak on agenda item 10, the importance of which\r\nis so clear.*\r\nMay I first repeat our heartfelt congratulations to you, Mr. President,\r\non your election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly, and convey to the Secretary-General, His Excellency\r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, the high esteem my delegation has for the\r\ncomprehensive, in-depth reports he has produced on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/4711) and on \"An Agenda for Peace\" (Al47/277).\r\nThe documents now before the Assembly are certainly a valid working\r\ninstrument that we should use as rationally as possible in order to enable the\r\ninternational community finally to start moving towards the noble purposes of\r\nthe Charter, which are:\r\n\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war ••• to reaffirm\r\nfaith in fundamental human rights ••• to establish conditions under which\r\njustice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other\r\nsources of international law can be maintained ••• to promote social\r\nprogress cmd better standards of life in larger freedom\".\r\nDocuments A/47/l and A/47/277, despite thei~ undeniable qualities,\r\nnevertheless call for a few comments that we shall present, succinctly, since\r\nmost of them have already been touched on by previous speakers, in particular\r\nthe Ambassador of Indonesia speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement,\r\nwhose analysis I share.\r\n* The President returned to the Chair.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI A/47/PV.47\r\n68\r\n(MI..z...-Diaw« Mali)\r\nTurning to the work of the Organization, we believe that the time has\r\ncome to make full use of what is termed the peace dividend. In order to do\r\nthis, the United Nations must abandon the attitude which was able to conceive\r\nof the world only in terms of antagonistic blocs. The end of the cold war now\r\nmeans that we can renounce that kind of thinking and adopt a different type of\r\nbehaviour. As the Secretary-General says, we are living in a period of hope\r\nthat must be transformed into a period of achievement through a new spirit of\r\nsolidarity, strengthened determination and bold action.\r\nThe winds of democracy that have been blowing since 1989 have left no\r\ncontinent untouched. This has been reflected in the liberation of peoples in\r\nseveral States that have become Members of our Organization, thus increasing\r\nthe workload and the responsibilities of the Secretary-General. Consequently,\r\nthe needs that the Organization must meet are increasing in number and variety.\r\nBut, of course, nothing in all of this should affect the efforts to be\r\nmade by the team that holds the reins of our Organization. The work of the\r\nOrganization must go on and be stepped up, parti . .r.ly in the area of\r\npeace-keeping operations, good offices, preventive diplomacy, humanitarian\r\nmissions, emergency relief and technical cooperation and cultural activities\r\nin the developing countries.\r\nMy delegation shares the view of the Secretary-General regarding the\r\nrationalization of the Secretariat, which necessarily implies the clos~st\r\npossible cooperation between Member States, the Secretary-General and the\r\nstaff. This is the only way that a viable restructuring can be carried out,\r\nin the best interests of the Member States and the staff. We also support any\r\nrestructuring process in the economic and social field whose end purpose is to\r\nenable the Secretariat to respond, in a timely and coordinated manner, to\r\ncomplex emergency situations and to development priorities.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nw, Malil\r\nhas\r\nto do\r\nonceive\r\nwar now\r\ntype of\r\nf hope\r\nirit of\r\nt no\r\npies in\r\neasing\r\nquently,\r\nvariety.\r\nto be\r\nf the\r\n.rian\r\nvities\r\nthe\r\n.est\r\nthe\r\n,d out,\r\n,port any\r\n,se is to\r\nto\r\n£\r\nA/47/PV.47\r\n69-70\r\n(Mr, Ciaw, Mali)\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General\u0027s initiative aimed at boosting\r\ncapability in respect of good offices, preventive diplomacy, peacemaking,\r\nearly warning research and analysis, and at strengthening the Secretariat\u0027s\r\ncapacity for planning and management in the area of peace-keeping. Our\r\nOrganization must from now on be able to rise to the new challenges and\r\nrespond to new objectives, specifically those which were recently defined at\r\nthe Rio de Janeiro Conference in respect of sustainable development and the\r\nenvironment.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.47\r\n71\r\n(Mr. Diaw. Mali)\r\nIn order to achieve this goal ~a urge the Secretary-General to pursue\r\nhis approach to ~e concept of the international civil survice and the\r\nimprovement of conditions of employment, including salaries, long-term\r\nrecruitment policies, the remuneration structure and career development. We\r\nbelieve that in order to attain these noble goals the Organization neeols\r\nincreased financial resources. But as a representative from one of the least-\r\ndeveloped countries, would I be acting responsibly in going along with a\r\npolicy which would demand payment of interest on any portion of assessments\r\nnot paid in time by a Member State? Of course not. To ensure the financial\r\nstability of our Organization, we must consider other means of paying assessed\r\ncontributions commensurate with each country\u0027s real economic capacity.\r\nBut my delegation does support the idea of establishing a $50 million\r\nreserve fund for peace-keeping operations, which would finance the start-up of\r\npeace-keeping operations pending the payment of assessed contributions.\r\nIn his report the Secretary-General advocates a world partnership for\r\ndevelopment that he deems to be feasible if an integrated approach to\r\ndevelopment is adopted. My delegation agrees with this way of tackling the\r\nproblem because we are convinced that political progress and economic\r\ndevelopment are linked and must be given the same attention by the developing\r\ncountries and by the industrialized countries - the former, constantly\r\nconcerned about how to mitigate their poverty; the latter, anxious to avoid\r\neconomic stagnation at all costs. Economic solidarity seems to us to be the\r\nonly choice for building a viable future for all.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.47\r\n72\r\n(Mr. Diaw, Mali)\r\nTurning to human rights, we b!lieve that \"An Agenda for Peace\" is\r\ndeserving of the attention that the international community has been giving it\r\nsince the beginning of our work on agenda item 10.\r\n~he Organization has exerted considerable efforts to ensure the\r\nmaintenance of peace throughout the world. These efforts deserve increased\r\nsupport, given the fact that there are more, rather than fewer, hotbeds of\r\ntension. The policy of dispatching United Nations forces would gradually give\r\nway to preventive diplomac~!, which has the advantage of avoiding armed\r\nconflicts, or at least containing them, and thus saving many lives.\r\nIn conclusion, may I once again express my delegation\u0027s total support\r\nfor the reports that the Secretary-General has placed before u~ at this\r\nforty-seventh session of the General Assembly, and express the hope that this\r\nwealth of material will be the effective instrument the international\r\ncommunity was waiting for :.n order finally to meet the many challenges on the\r\nroad to renewal.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: We have heard the last speaker on this item.\r\nThe 167 statements made during the Assembly\u0027s general debate and the 65\r\nstatements heard so far un·jer agenda item 10, \"Report of the Secretary-General\r\non the work of the Organization\", inclUding the report \"An Agenda for Peace\",\r\naffirm the view that the membership of the United Nations as a whole has\r\nwelcomed the report of the Secretary-General as a very important contribution\r\nat this turning point in the Organization\u0027s history. It is fair to say that\r\n;\r\nthe end of the cold war no~ only affords an opportunity but makes it necessary\r\nI\r\nto undertake with a sense of urgency a comprehensive set of actions Gr.d\r\nreforms in the direction t.\u0027le Secretary-General has pointed out.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.. 4.7\r\n73\r\n(~e President)\r\nI should like to recall that the Secretary-General has made it clear\r\nthat. he has not put his recommendations forward as a package and that it is up\r\nto the Member States to decide which recommendation to act on and in what form.\r\nDuring the Assembly\u0027 s general debate a number of important and\r\ninteresting proposals were made, and many far-reaching ideas have been put\r\nforward during the debate on this item. They form a solid basis for our work\r\nin the future. I should like to thank the representatives of all the\r\ndelegations that contributed to the fruitful consideration of this item.\r\nDebate is an importB.nt part of the road that we have yet to cover in\r\norder to reach practical results. It is now time for the Main Committees,\r\nwithin their respective spheres of competence, to do their part and contribute\r\nto the attainment of our objective of revitalizing the United Nations.\r\nI attach great importance to the informal consultations on this item\r\nwith representatives of Member States. I intend to establish immediately,\r\nwith the participation of the Chairmen of the Main Committees, a working\r\nmechanism through which we will coordinate our further activities. This\r\nmechanism will be finally constituted after the conclusion of the informal\r\nconsultations and discussions which I am now conducting as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nIt is customary for the Assembly to take note of the annual report of\r\nthe Secretary-General. If I hear no objection, may I consider that the\r\nAssembly wishes to take note of the report of the Secretary-General?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe PRESIDENT: We have concluded this stage of our consideration\r\nof agenda item 10.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.25 p.m.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n"
