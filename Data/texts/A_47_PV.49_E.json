If X am not\r\nmistaken, this is the first time that we are dealing directly here with\r\nthis Euro-At1antic body, now expanded to the Asian region and today\r\nencompassing 52 participating States.\r\nToday I am speaking here as the representative of the Czech and\r\nSlovak Federal Republic. As members already know, the process of the\r\ndissolution of my country has started and should soon lead to new\r\nconstitutional arrangements and the creation of two independent States, as\r\nof 1 January 1993. Let me express the hope that both new States, which\r\nwill respect and assume all the obligations and commitments of the Czech\r\nand Slovak Federal Republic, will be admitted as Members of the United\r\nNations as soon as possible.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.49\r\n3\r\n(Mr. SuchQnek, Czechoslovakia)\r\nThe collaps9 of communist regimes in our part of the world and the end of\r\nthe cold-war, hipolar confrontation have, unfortunately, also brought about\r\nnew dimensions of insecurity. The ongoing period of transition is accompanied\r\nby n~~erous threats to stability and regional security, to social peace, to\r\nhuman rights and funda~ental freedoms, to democratic institutions and to the\r\nrule of law.\r\nNew problems and crise21 and the subsequent reactions of various\r\ninternational bodies as instruments of crisis management have brought about a\r\nwave of criticism and scepticism as to their capabilities to cope with these\r\nproblems individually or collectively.\r\nAs the representative of Czechoslovakia - a Member of the United Nations\r\nand a participating State of the CSCE - I must say that both institutions, the\r\nUnited Nations and the CSCE, have actively met these new challenges and are\r\ntrying in the most responsible manner - though sometimes not without lagging\r\nbehind developments - to find adequate responses for today and for the\r\nfuture. The scope, complexity and newness of the problems in this rather\r\nfluid state of internal development in both institutions might be our only\r\nexcuse when facing criticism in this respect.\r\nIn our CSCE region, both the United Nations and the CSCE, among others,\r\nare dealing with the same problems with increased intensity, usually from\r\ntheir own perspectives but in tandem. Without appropriate cooperation and\r\ncoordination, these activities might bring counter-productive results and be\r\nseen or interpreted - or even misused - to create some sort of unhealthy\r\ncompetition. In the worst case they might compromise all the efforts of the\r\ninternational community and, to a certain degree, even the organizations\r\nthemselves.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.49\r\n4-5\r\n(Mr, Suchan9k, Czechoslovakia)\r\nTherefore, we are of the op,inion that the new tasks of the international\r\ncomm~nity, the United Nations and the CSCE, require clearer rel~tions and\r\ncloser contacts, as well as enhanced cooperation, coordination and concerted\r\naction between the United Nations system and the CSCE~\r\nThe basic approach of the United Nations to these new challenge~ is\r\nreflected most appropriately in the report of t,he Secretary-General uAn Agenda\r\nfor Peace\", The Czech and Slovak Federal Republic shares the view that the\r\nstate of world and European affairs makes it urgent to revitalize the\r\npossibilities already envisaged in the United Nations Charter. and calls for\r\nregional arrangements and organizations to be given a more active and\r\neffective role in dealing with reqional problems by making use of their\r\npotenti~l for taking on additional responsibilities 1?S a matter of\r\ndecentralization and cooperation with the United Nations.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/4\u0027J1?V.49\r\n6\r\n(Mr. Suchanek. C2echoslov~kig)\r\nThe basic approach of the CSCE is reflected in the Helsinki 1992 Summit\r\n~..N:zwnel!1t \"TheCha119nges of Change\" (A/47/361.. annex). The question of\r\ninteraction between different international bodies, and moat of all between\r\nthe United Nations and the CSC8, acquired a new dimension for the CSCE\r\ncountries after the Helsinki Summit. At that Summit Heads of State or\r\nGovernment declarea their anderstanding that the CSCE is a regional\r\narrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter - the\r\nrights and responsibilities of the United Naticns Security Council remaining\r\nunaffected in their entirety - and as such provides an important link between\r\nEuropean and global security.\r\nThe CSCE participating States are, inter alia, of the opinion that it\r\nwill be essential for the success of efforts to foster democratic changes\r\nwithin the CSCE framework to increase cooperation with other European and\r\ntransatlantic organizations and institutions. We also believe that a lasting\r\nand peaceful order will be built on mutually reinforcing institutions, each\r\nwith its own area of action and responsibility.\r\nThe Helsinki Suwmit also opened the way to completely new spheres of CSCE\r\nactivity in the field of conflict prev.ention and conflict management,\r\nincluding CSCE peace-keeping, and initiatives further to enhance mechanisms\r\nfor the peaceful settlement of disputes, thus opening up new areas of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the CSCE. The new CSCE Forum for\r\nSecurity Cooperation represents a further development in this sense.\r\nThe CSCE\u0027s vast experience in promoting and monitoring the implementation\r\nof international standards and CSCE commitments, especially in the field of\r\nhuman rights and democratic values and institutions, has been complemented by\r\nnew elements of early warning and preventive diplomacy, including setting up\r\nthe post of the CSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities 3 by which\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.49\r\n7\r\n(Lit. SuchQnek, Cz@chosloY3ida)\r\nthe CSCE hopes further to strongthen its capabili.ties to promote and to\r\nmonito~ the implementation of the already well-established CSCE standards. We\r\nccnsidcr that these aspects provide fundamental criteria for assessing the\r\nactivities of Governments in tllcir relations towards other countries or\r\ntowardB their own citizens.\r\nThe viability of n~w, emerging CSCE conflict-prevention and\r\nconflict-manaqement capabilities should and will be proven by time and in\r\npractice. The more and more complex and universal character of this flexible\r\nformation, working on the basis of consensus, destines it to play an important\r\nrole matters arising in the vast CSCE area reaching beyond Europe itself. To\r\nopen itself up to these new vistas of cooperation with the United Nations, the\r\nCSCB will also have to address institutional and organizational aspects of its\r\ndevelopment so as to achieve, step by step, greater compatibility with the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn his statement at the current session of the ijeneral Assembly, the\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic,\r\nMr. Moravcik, stressed that this year\u0027s discussion on the issue of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the CSCE could develop on two levels: first,\r\nthe conceptual level, to clarify the fundamental political meaning of\r\ncoordination, both in the immediate future and in the medium and long term;\r\nand, secondly, the practical, concrete level, where the activities of the tuo\r\ninstitutions have already begun to overlap, making it possible to draw\r\nconclusions.\r\nThis discussion has already started in both the United Nations and the\r\nCSCE~ but, because it is at the initial stage of the first exchanges of ideas,\r\nwe cannot be more specific on concrete forms of cooperation and coordination,\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n------------------------\r\nAl47JPV.49\r\n8\r\n(Mr. Suchanek, Czechoslovakia)\r\nor on any formal patterns of relatiollships between the .United Nations and the\r\nCSCE. Only through inbensive discussions will it be possible to produce more\r\nspecific ideas and proposa)~ for a division of labour between these two\r\nbodies, for mechanisms and techniques of consultation, harmonization of\r\napproaches, complementarity, joint or supportive undertakings, the exchange of\r\ninformation, and so on. These ideas might then be reflected in a report by\r\nthe Secretary-General to the General Assembly at its next session, as\r\nindicated in draft resolution A/47/L.ll.\r\nThe draft resolution, entitled \"Cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\", was worked out in\r\nintensive cooperation with the delegations of member States of the CSCE and\r\nwith many otber States. It was submitted to the General Assembly by the\r\nfollowing 35 Member States: Albania, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus,\r\nBelgium, BUlgaria, Cyprus, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,\r\nGermany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malt.a,\r\nNetherlands r Norway, Poland, Portugal, ~epublic of Moldova, Romania, Russian\r\nFederation, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine~ United Kingdom of Great Britain\r\nand Northern Ireland and United States of America. All these initial sponsors\r\nare CSCE members, which should by no means be seen as an effort to egclude\r\nStates from other geographical regions or arrangements. The following\r\nadditional States have indicated their interest and have become sponsors:\r\nCanada, Croatia, Japan, Kazakhstan, Liechtenstein, Lithuania and Slovenia.\r\nThe sponsors of the draft resolution bore in mind that the discussion of\r\nthe agenda item this year represents only the very beginning of its\r\nconsideration. It was drafted, therefore, in general and fully acceptable\r\nterms, trying to express the political importance of the item for regional\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.49\r\n9-1.0\r\n(Mr. SUchanek« Czechoslovakia)\r\nseeu~ity and the need for enhanced cooperation and coordination between the\r\nUnited Nations and the CSCE.\r\nThe delegation of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, speaking on\r\nbehalf of the sponsors, commends the draft resolution for adopticn and\r\nexpresses the hope that in view of its non-controversial character it will be\r\nadopted by consensus.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.49\r\n11\r\nMr. BREITENSTEIN (Finland): For almost two decades the Conference\r\non Security and Cooperation {C§CE) helped ease the pain of the division of\r\nEurope into two antagonisti~ blocs. At the same time, the process begun in\r\nHelsinki helped plant and nurture the seeds that in time sprouted through the\r\ncracks to break apart the concrete walls of Europe\u0027s division.\r\nFrom the very beginning Finland lent the process not only the name of its\r\ncapital but its full political support. A neutral State \u0027on the cutting edge\r\nof confrontation, Finland had a vital interest in moderating East-West\r\ntensions in any way it could. In the new Europe, East-West tensions have\r\ngiven way to hope and cooperation, but also to despair and destruction.\r\nFinland sees and seeks a vital role for the CSCE in managing both the promises\r\nand problems of post-cold war change in our part of the world.\r\nThis summer the highest political leaders of the participating States\r\nreturned to the birthplace of the Helsinki process to take stock and to look\r\nahead. Reaffirming the commitments to the Charter of the United Nations, the\r\nleaders declared their understanding that the CSCE is a regional arrangement\r\nin the sense of Chapter VII! of the Charter. They went on to state that as\r\nsuch the CSCE provides an important link between European and global security,\r\nand pledged that the CSCE will work closely with the United Nations,\r\nespecially in preventing and settling conflicts.\r\nWhen the capacity of the United Nations to keep the peace and prevent\r\nconflicts has been stretched to the limit, it is natural that the capacities\r\nof others are looked into. We applaud the Secretary-General\u0027s repeated calls\r\nfor closer cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations. The CSCE decision with respect to Chapter VIII of the\r\nCharter is fully in line with the concept of mutually supportive roles for the\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.49\r\n12\r\n(Mr. Breitenstein, Finland)\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations, as set out in his report \"Agenda\r\nfor Peace\". Keeping in mind the unique CSCE experience of conceptualizing,\r\nnegotiating and implementing confidence-building measures, we strongly support\r\nthe Secretary-General\u0027s suggestion of periodic consultations between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional arrangements on such measures. We look forward to\r\nhis early follow-up to this.\r\nIn order to meet the new post-cold-war challenges which Europe faces, the\r\nHelsinki Swm~it of the CSCE put in place a comprehensive programme of conflict\r\nprevention and crisis management, including early warning, peace-keeping and\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes. The continuing carnage in some corners\r\nof the extended CSCE area has made it abundantly clear that the CSCE needed\r\ninstruments that can turn it from a promoter of change into a manager of\r\nconflict and change.\r\nMy Government welcomes the strengthening of the executive capability of\r\n~he CSCE; both in terms of the Council and of the Committee of Senior\r\nOfficials. Likewise, the establishment of the post of the CSCE High\r\nCommissioner on National Minorities was not only necessary but long overdue.\r\nWe count on his active engagement in providing early warning and taking early\r\naction in regard to tensions involving national minority issues which might\r\ndevelop into a conflict within the CSCE area.\r\nThe Helsinki Summit decided that peace-keeping constitutes an important\r\nelement of CSCE ~onflict prevention and management. CSCE peace-keeping does\r\nnot entail enforcement action, and it requires the consent of the parties\r\ndirectly concerned. According to the Charter, the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes is one of the main functions of regional arrangements. Here again,\r\nnew mechanisms within the CSCE could serve as an inspiration beyond the\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/4\u00271/PV.49\r\n13\r\n(~Breitenstein, Finland)\r\nregion. Finland, like the other Nordic countries, is of the view that\r\nregional arrangements should concentrate on further developing such methods of\r\npeaceful settlement as would ensure mandatory involvement by a third. party.\r\nThe results of the CSCE meeting of, experts on the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes, held in Geneva earlier this month, were also a step forward.\r\nWith regard to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, the CSCE is\r\nassisting the peace efforts o\u0027f the United Nations and those of the European\r\nCommunity in various ways. In particular, the CSCE seeks to prevent the\r\nconflicts in Croatia, as well as in Bosnia and Herzegovina, from spreading to\r\nother parts of the former Yugoslavia. Accordingly, CSCE missions will be\r\nmonitoring the situation in the relevant areas.\r\nUnder the auspices of the Minsk Conference, the CSCE has shouldered a\r\nmajor role in attempts to. settle the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan\r\nover Nagorny-Karabakh. It is also involved in Moldova and Georgia. In all of\r\nthese cases, close cooperation with the United Nations continues to be a\r\nnecessity.\r\nWe can only regret that the optimism which pervaded Europe only a short\r\nwhile ago has been tempered by the fury of open conflict and aggression. War,\r\nmindless destruction and wholesale violation of human rights have returned to\r\nEurope under the guise of \"ethnic cleansing\".\r\nThe challenges which these conflicts pose may sometimes seem enormous;\r\nindeed, they sometimes are enormous. But they must not be seen as impossible\r\nto overcome. Coordinated efforts by the United Nations and the CSCE as well\r\nas ether European and transatlantic institutions are now required. Inactivity\r\nby the international community would be unforgivable.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.49\r\n14-15\r\n(Mr. Breitenstein, Fin~)\r\nMy delegation welcomes the initiative of Czechoslovakia, current\r\nChairman-in-Office of the CSCE Council, in putting the question of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the CSCE on the agenda for this session. We\r\nare among the sponsors of draft Tesolution A/47/L.ll, just introduced by the\r\nrepresentative of the Czech and ~lGvak Federal Republic. We look forward to\r\nits adoption by consensus.\r\nThe draft resolution stresses the n~ed for enhan~ed cooperation and\r\n•cooruination between the CSCE and the United Nations and requests the\r\nSecretary-General to report thereon next autumn. We look forward to this\r\nreport from the Secretary-General.\r\nIn the meantime, it would in our view be useful to discuss cooperation\r\nbetween the CSCE and the United Nations in an appropriate United Nations\r\nforum. The idea has already been put forward in the Charter Committee tha~\r\nrepresentatives of established regional organizations be invited to present\r\ntheir views on various aspects of cooperation between the United Nations and\r\ntheir respective organizations. We are in favour of this and will take it up\r\nagain when the Charter Committee reconvenes in February.\r\nLet me close by quoting the Secretary-General on the subject at hand in\r\nhis report \"An Agenda for Peace\":\r\n\"regional action as a matter of decentralization, delegation and\r\ncooperation with United Nations efforts could not only lighten the burden\r\nof the [Security] Council but also contribute to a deeper sense of\r\nparticipation, consensus and democratization in international affairs\".\r\n(A/47/277, para. 64)\r\nWe could not agree more. The CSCE is beginning to shoulder its share of the\r\nburden.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.49\r\n16\r\n~ (United States of America): On behalf of the\r\nUnited States, I am pleased to speak in support of the draft resolution\r\nintroduced by the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic regarding cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (CSCE).\r\nAt the Helsinki CSCE follow-up meeting which ended in July, the CSCE\r\nissued a document entitled \"The Challenges of Change\". The document reflects\r\nthe recognition by the CSCE participating States of the fact that, while our\r\nworld has changed, our principles have not. We look to the Helsinki document\r\nas a programme to enhance our capabilities for concerted action and to\r\nintensify our cooperation for democracy, prosperity and equal rights of\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe CSCE mandate for security and cooperati~n is broad. The United\r\nStates has always supported the CSCE as a vehicle for advancing human rights\r\nand for promoting the growth of democratic institutions. Keeping and\r\nrestoring peace begins with exactly these endeavours. We now look to the CSCE\r\nas well to facilitate increased dialogue and cooperation among its members and\r\nto prevent and resolve conflicts.\r\nIn the Helsinki document, the CSCE participating States reaffirmed their\r\ncommitment to the Charter of the United Nations and declared that the CSCE is\r\na regional arrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the United Nations\r\nCharter. The CSCE mechanisms created in Helsinki are already being employed\r\nin places such as the former Yugoslavia and Nagorny-Karabakh. Cooperation and\r\ncoordination in these locations are necessary elements if the CSCE and the\r\nUnited Nations are to be effective in achieving their common goals.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.. 49\r\n17\r\n(Mrs. Rockefeller,\r\nUnited Stat~)\r\nWe welcome the initiative of Czechoslovakia, as CSCE Chairman-in-Office,\r\nin calling for enhanced cooperation and coordination between the CSCE and the\r\nUnited Nations. We believe that the request for a report from the\r\nSecretary-General on United Nations-CSCE cooperation and the inclusion on the\r\nagenda of the forty-eighth session of the Assembly of an item related to such\r\ncooperation will advance the commitm~nts made by the CSCE participating States\r\nin Helsinki.\r\nMr. RICHARDSON (United Kingdom): I am delighted to have the honour\r\nto speak OIl behalf of the European Community and its member States on the\r\nsubject of cooperation between the United Nations and the Conference on\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). We welcome the initiative taken by\r\nthe Czech and Slovak Federal Republic as current Cbairman-in-Office of the\r\nCSCE, in proposing this new item for the agenda of the General Assembly.\r\nThis initiative is a timely one. At the Helsinki summit earlier this\r\nyear, Heads of Government nf the participating States of the CSCE declared\r\ntheir understanding that the CSCE is a regional arrangement under Chapter VIII\r\nof the United Nations Charter. That step, which reflects the developing role\r\nand responsibilities of the CSCE, was supported by the European Community and\r\nits member States. It is a step which is very much in line with the ideas on\r\nthe mutually supportive roles of the United Nations and regional organizations\r\nset out by the Secretary-General in \"An Agenda for Peace\".\r\nThe CSCE was born during the period of the cold war. Many of the\r\nchallenges it faces now, often springing from rival nationalisms and ethnic\r\nconflict, are very different from those that prevailed then. At Helsinki, the\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.49\r\n18\r\n(Mr. Richards~,\r\nUnited Kingdom)\r\nBritish Prime Minister, speaking as President of the Council of Ministers of\r\nthe European Communities, warned against the CSCE being a bystander, a\r\nhand-wringing onlooker to Europe\u0027s quarrels, It must develop the means and\r\nthe will to act before a crisis escalates into armed conflict.\r\nThe Helsinki summit approved a number of measures designed to make the\r\nCSCE more effective: the establishment of the post of CSCE High Commissioner\r\nfor National Minorities, for example. to provide early warning of ethnic\r\nconflict and to promote the early settlement of such conflicts. The CSCE can\r\nnow undertake peace-keeping, a~ area in which it clearly has much to profit\r\nfrom the experience of the United Nations. Participating States of the CSCE\r\nregularly assess and monitor each other\u0027s implementation of CSCE commitments,\r\nincluding in the vital areas of democracy and human rights. Initiatives are\r\nnow under discussion within the CSCF. to establish more effective mechanisms\r\nfor the peaceful settlement of disputes in the areas of s4bitration and\r\nconciliation.\r\nIn the area of preventive diplomacy in particular, the United Nations and\r\nthe CSCE can support and reinforce each other. In a number of crisis areas -\r\nthe former Yugoslavia, the conflict in and around Nagorny-Karabakh# Moldova,\r\nand Georgia - the CSCE is playing a part alongside the United Nations. IXl the\r\ncase of the conflict in and around Nagorny-Karabakh the CSCE has taken the\r\nlead in the search for a settlement. In the former Yugoslavia it has\r\nsupported and complemented the efforts of both the United Nations and the\r\nEuropean Community. It has dispatched long-term missions to the territories\r\nof Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina, and to the former Yugoslav republic of\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI\r\nAl47/PV.49\r\n19\r\n(Mr. Richardson,\r\nUnited Kingdom)\r\nMacedonia, and it has shared in the investigation of human rights abuses and\r\nin assisting neighbouring States in the rigorous enforcement of United Nations\r\nsanctions through the deployment of sanctions-assistance missions. The troika\r\nof the CSCE is represented on the Steering Committee of the International\r\nConference on the former Yugoslavia.\r\nThere can be no doubting the scale of the challenges facing the\r\npeacemakers in these and other newly arising conflicts. Whether they come\r\nfrom the United Nations or from the CSCE, or indeed from the European\r\nCommunity. they face an uphill task. Mutually supporting endeavours are\r\nbeginning to emerge. The precise balance may differ from problem to problem.\r\nClearly, there is an ever present need to guard against duplication, and\r\ncoordination is vital, as those who proposed this agenda item rightly\r\nperceived. But there is more than enough work to go round.\r\nWe warmly welcome the debate which has been initiated here. We\r\nanticipate that it will be pursued further in future sessions, and we should\r\nlike to see the Secretary-General provide a report on cooperation and\r\ncoordination between the two organizations in time for the next session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nAs I have already indicated, there is likely to be increasing room for\r\nfruitful cooperation between the United Nations and the CSCE in underpinning\r\nstability within the CSCE area. Such stability is vital to world peace, and\r\nit is right that the General Assembly should focus on and encourage\r\ncooperation between the two organizations.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.49\r\n20\r\nMr. OSVALD (Sweden): Let me at the outset take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate Brazil, Djibouti, New Zealand, Pakistan and Spain on their\r\nelection to seats on the Security Council for the period 1993 to 1994. I am\r\nconvinced that all five countries will make a valuable contribution to the\r\nwork of the Security Council for the benefit of all the Members of the United\r\nNations. My Government has also asked me to convey especially to New Zealand\r\nand Spain our best wishes for every success in their important task.\r\nThe extension and intensification of cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) is an\r\nissue of political importance and some urgency. It is also an issue with a\r\nnumber of unresolved practical implications which need to be addressed.\r\nThe complex problems we are now facing in some parts of Europe in the\r\nwake of the collapse of communism require us to develop in a very concrete way\r\nthe elements of what has been called a network for European security. This is\r\nbasically what the CSCE is about today. Old structures and interrelationships\r\nneed to be adjusted and complemented by fresh initiatives in order to enable\r\nus to come to grips with new problems.\r\nIn this context, increased cooperation and coordination between the\r\nUnited Nations and the CSCE is highly desirable. The initiative of the Czech\r\nand Slovak Federal Republic to propose a special item on the agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to discuss cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCSCE is therefore very timely.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nW471PV.49\r\n21\r\n(Mr. Osvald, Sweden)\r\nIn his recent report \"An Agenda for Peace\" the Secretary-General rightly\r\nhighlighted the potential for increased cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand regional arrangements, as envisaged in the Charter. Sweden has followed\r\nwith interest and appreciation the recent examples of interaction between the\r\nUnited Nations and various regional organizations, groups of States and\r\nindividual States in tackling difficult problems in Somalia, Cambodia,\r\nEl Salvador, Nicaragua and the former Yugoslavia. We fully share the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s view that this potential should be utilized more fully now\r\nthat the cold war has given way to a new era of opportunity.\r\nThe CSCE States, for their part, declared last July their understanding\r\nthat theCSCE is a regional arrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and as such provides an important link between\r\nEuropean, transatlantic and global security. This decision is, of course,\r\nwithout prejudice to the unique competence of the United Nations as the global\r\nguardian of international peace and security. As the CSCE States put it in\r\nthe 1992 Helsinki Document,\r\n\"The rights and responsibilities of the United Nations Security Council\r\nremain unaffected in their entirety.\" (A/47/361, annex, p. 42)\r\nThe basis for strengthening the coordination and cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the CSCE has thus been laid. It should now be compleme~ted\r\nby increased practical cooperation. We already have some examples of mutual\r\nreinforcement, such as the CSCE\u0027s active support for the International\r\nConference on the former Yugoslavia, and the practical cooperation on the\r\nground between the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and the European\r\nCommunity Monitoring Mission, in which some CSCE countries are participating.\r\nThe CSCE is also making a valuable contribution to the efforts to prevent\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\n----------------.----------\r\nA/47/PV.49\r\n22\r\n(Mr. Osvald, Sweden)\r\nthe conflict from spreading into Kosovo, Vojvodina and Sandjak~as well as\r\ninto Macedonia and neighbouring countries. Together with others, the CSCE is\r\nalso assisting neighbouring countries in implementing the United Nations\r\nsanctions against Serbia and Montenegro through a series of missions. In\r\naddition, there have been contacts between the United Nations and the CSCE in\r\nthe area that is known in the CSCE as the human dimension.\r\nThese experiences, and the challenges of the crises that are before us,\r\ncompel us to go further. There is a great need for flexibility and practical\r\nthinking. The balance between different elements in the international n~twork\r\nof mutually reinforcing institutions is not given once and for all; neither is\r\nthe division of tasks and responsibilities. In our joint efforts to maintain\r\nand strengthen peace in the CSCE area, we must always be open to new\r\napproaches and be prepared to devise the modalities of cooperation so as best\r\nto meet the exigencies of each particular situation.\r\nWhen Sweden assumes the chairmanship of the CSCE Council of Ministers in\r\nDecember my Government intends to work for the further enhancement of the\r\ncapacity of the CSCE in the areas of conflict prevention and crisis management\r\nand, when appropriate, in cooperation with international organizations,\r\nespecially the United Nations. I am confident that we may draw on the\r\nOrganization\u0027s unique role and experience in the fields of peacemaking and\r\npeace-keeping. I also trust that the CSCE, for its part, can contribute to\r\nUnited Nations efforts to maintain peace and security by, for example,\r\nproviding early warning and information on problems of common concern, or by\r\nlending appropriate assistance to efforts to prevent and solve conflicts and\r\nto promote the ideals of d~mocracy and human rights, which are basic tenets of\r\nthe CSCE process.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.49\r\n23\r\n(Mr. Osvald, Sweden)\r\nIt is our hope that the question of the interaction between the United\r\nNations and the CSCE will be addressed at the forthcominq meetinq of the\r\nCouncil of Ministers of the CSCE, to be held in Stockholm On 14-15 December.\r\nAs Chairman-in-Offi(!e of the CSCE next year, Sweden will contribute to the\r\nbest of its ability to the practical development of a structured relationship\r\nbetween the United Nations and the CSCE. For example, it might be desirable\r\nto consider further how to achieve a rationnl division of labou~ between the\r\nUnited Nations and the CSCE in various types of missions. Maybe we can arrive\r\nat some rules of thumb in this respect, or we should at least make sure that\r\nregular exchange of information takes place so that each party, each\r\ninterlocking institution, is aware of what the other is doing.\r\nTo sum up, we believe that flexibility, coordination and mutual presence\r\nare key aspects of the relationship between the United Nations and the CSCE.\r\nWe would welcome a report from the Secretary-General on this subject at the\r\nnext session ot the General Assembly, as requ~sted in the draft resolution, of\r\nwhich Sweden has the pleasure to be a sponsor.\r\nMr. CAMILLERI (Malta): The subject of regional cooperation is\r\nattracting particula~ attention at the current session of the General\r\nAssembly. This is in recognition of the fact that, as the Secretary-General\r\nhas pointed out ,in his report, \"An Agenda for Peace\", the new international\r\nsituation has opened up renewed opportunities for linkages between action at\r\nthe regional and the wider international levels, especially in the context of\r\nefforts towards safeguarding global peace and security.\r\nThe discussions that have taken place in plenary meeting under item 10 of\r\nthe agenda, and in the Sixth Committee# in connection with the report of the\r\nCharter Committee, have already started to explore the many promising yet\r\ncomplex aspects arising from the enhanced role of regional cooperation.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl4i1PV.49\r\n24\r\n(Mr. Camilleri. Malta)\r\nThese aspects are perhaps most sharply brought out in a consideration of\r\nthe item before us today: coordination of activities between the CSCE and the\r\nUnited Nations. The CSCE has been in existence for almost 20 years. Yet it\r\nis only at this session that it has been found necessary and appropriate for\r\nan item on cooperation between the CSCE and the United Nations to be placed\r\nfor the first time on the agenda of the General Assembly.\r\nIn his report, \"An Agonda for Peace\", the Secretary-General reflects upon\r\nthe fact that for over 45 years, until very lately, the notion of cooperation\r\nat the regional ~~val was sometimes conceived more as an alternative than as a\r\ncomplement to action at the wider, international level.\r\nNowhere perhaps is the changed role of regional organizations better\r\nhighlighted than in the case of the CSCE. Conceived, and effectively\r\ndeveloped, as a device of peaceful coexistence in the cold-war era, the CSCE\r\nis today dramatically and most successfully transforming itself into a tool of\r\npeaceful cooperation, in an era when commonly snared objectives are defined in\r\nterms of democracy, prosperity and an equal right to security.\r\nOther regional organizations, in Asia, Latin America and Africa, have of\r\ncourse also f.ound in the new world order enhanced opportunities for promoting\r\ncooperation at the regional leval as part of the wider, international effort\r\nto strengthen democracy, prosperity and security. Yet in the case of other\r\nregional organizations the process was essentially one of evolution, not\r\ntransformation. It is only in Europe, primarily through the CSCE, that\r\ncooperation at the regional level has had radically to adapt policies and\r\nstructures originally aimed at r, w:::.aining the tensions of bipolarity to the\r\nchallenges of pursuing commonly defined objectives.\r\nI\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI Al4iIPV\u0027.49\r\n25\r\n(Mr. Carnilleri, Malta)\r\nAftar an initial period of hesitation, members of the CSCE have shown\r\nthemselves deeply conscious of the nature and potantial of the transformation\r\nthat has occurred in their organization. It is for this reason that, as one\r\nof its first acts of renewal, in Helsinki last July, the CSCE formally\r\ndeclared itself an \"arrangement\" under Chapter VIII of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. Malta was foremost among those that proposed and promoted\r\nthis declaration. We saw in this move a necessary affirmation of the changed\r\nrole and purpose of the CSCE ~ a role and purpose that now closely reflect the\r\nessential principles and o~jectives of the Charter and the new spirit of\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/4.\u00271iPV.49\r\n26\r\n(Mr. Caroilleri, Malt~)\r\nAn awareness of its new-found purpose, first laid out in the 1990 Charter\r\nof Paris and more clearly elaborated in this year\u0027s Helsinki decisions, is\r\ntherefore one of the strengths of the CSCE. Another strength lies in the\r\nflexible and wide-ranging methods and structures that it has carried with it\r\nthrough the process of transformation. For over two decades \u0027the CSCE slowly\r\nand painstakingly sought to develop innovative modalities for action in an\r\nextensive number of areas - including confidence- and security-building\r\nmeasures in the military field, action for the protection of human rights,\r\nprocedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes, measures for economic and\r\nother cooperation, provision for action at the subregional level, and many\r\nothers.\r\nEven in an embryonic form, these modalities proved effective in serving\r\nthe purposes of the old world order. Transformed and revitalized, they can\r\ncertainly be harnessed more effectively in the service of the new. The\r\naccelerated programme of institution-building which was launched at the\r\nHelsinki summit this year could indeed not have taken place in the absence of\r\na secure foundation rooted in years of experience.\r\nTwo aspects of the CSCE\u0027s accumulated experience in the promotion of\r\naction at the regional level are, in this context, of special and universal\r\nrelevance. In the first instance, there is recognition of the fact that the\r\npursuit of peace and security is a multidimensional exercise involving action\r\nnot only in the military field but also in the economic, social, humanitarian\r\nand other fields. The Sec~etary-General forcefully and effectively underlines\r\nthis point in his two reports, one entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\" and the\r\nother on the work of the Organization for 1992. The experience of the CSCE\r\nprovides practical confirmation of this reality.\r\nI\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI AJ47/pv.49\r\n27\r\n(Mr. Carnilleri, Malta)\r\nA second relevant aspect of the CSCE experience concerns the issue of\r\ncollective action as it relates to the question of State sovereignty. In an\r\nincreasingly interdependent world, the notion of sovereignty could readily\r\ngive rise to misplaced sensitivities. The CSCE experience teaches us that\r\neven in the context of a bipolar world - and much more in a world dedicated to\r\ndemocracy, prosperity and sha~ed security - the notion of sovereignty cannot\r\nbe permitted to stand inexorably in the way of collective action, especially\r\nin such areas as the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nThe immense upheavals that have taken place in Europe over the last few\r\nyears are the conditioning factors in the transformation which is taking place\r\nin the CSCE, as indeed they have been the catalyst for the emergence of a\r\nwhole new order in international relations. The challenges, dangers and risks\r\naccompanying these welcome upheavals are, understandably, felt nowhere more\r\nthan within the European region itself, where the old dragons of ethnic hatred\r\nand national rivalries have been unleashed through the s\u0026ne processes that\r\nhave ushered in freedom and democracy.\r\nIt is in this context that the CSCE has concentrated much of its\r\nnew-found enthusiasm for institution-building. on the objectives of preventive\r\ndiplomacy and conflict resolution. The new experiments which were launched in\r\nHelsinki, especially through the creation of a post of High Commissioner for\r\nNational Minorities, the empowering of the CSCE to conduct peace-keeping\r\noperations, and the setting up of a Forum for Security Cooperation, were bold\r\nand far-reaching. They now need to be nurtured through a formative process\r\nwhich, among other things, will have to flesh out practical issues ranging\r\nfrom questions of coordination and cooperation with other organizations, both\r\nregional and global, to more mundane but equally important questions relating\r\nto the financing and management of peace-keeping operations.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.49\r\n28\r\n(Mr. Caroilleri. Malta)\r\nOne can readily see in all these developments a special relevance to the\r\nongoing debate within the United Nations regarding many of the issues raised\r\nby the Secretary-General in his \"Agenda for Peace\", where questions relating\r\nto preventive diplomacy and peace-keeping are assigned a high priority. It is\r\nfor this reason that my delegation sees this year\u0027s discussion of the item on\r\nthe coordination of activities between the CSCE and the United Nations as the\r\nbeginning of a necessary process - a process which offers encouraging\r\nprospects for future development but which must not be forced too quickly\r\nthrough its present formative stage.\r\nIn this spirit, my delegation supports the draft resolution on this\r\nsubject which has been presented by the representative of Czechoslovakia and\r\nwhich, together with other members of the CSCE, we are indeed most happy to\r\nsponsor.\r\nMr. GRAF ZU RANTZAU (Germany): I have the honour to speak as a\r\nmember of the present Troika of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in\r\nEurope (CSCE). My delegation and my GOvernment fully share the views\r\nexpressed by the Presidency of the Eut\u0027opean Community earlier today. During\r\nits chai~manship of the CSCE, Germany made particular efforts to establish a\r\nrelationship between the United Nations and the CSCE. We wanted to contribute\r\nto creating favourable conditions in a new field of cooperation which will\r\ncertainly gain increased importance in the context of the Secretary-General\u0027s\r\nreport \"An Agenda for Peace\". In a time of increased challenge to a world in\r\ntransition, peace and stability will increasingly depend on strengthened\r\ncoordination and cooperation between the United Nations and the various\r\nregional organizations.\r\nI\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI\r\nAl471PV.49\r\n29\r\n(Mr. Graf zu Rantzau, GermanY)\r\nThe CSCE played a key role in ovarcoming the cold war and in bringing\r\nabout the change towa~ds democracy in Europe. Within its framework the\r\nGermans, in 1990, regained their national unity. The same year, the Charter\r\nof Paris laid the groundwork for creating a community of free and democratic\r\nnations from Vancouver to Vladivostok.\r\nThe CSCE considers itself a regional arrangement within the meaning of\r\nChapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. It bears special responsibility\r\nfor strengthening security in Europe. There is no rivalry or competition -\r\nthe mandates of the CSCE and the United Nations complement each other. Since\r\nthe adoption of the Helsinki Final Act, the CSCE has helped gain currency for\r\nthe purpo~es and principles of the United Nations Charter. In the fields of\r\npreventive diplomacy, peace-keeping, peacemaking and conflict resolution, both\r\nthe United Nations and the CSCE find themselves in a process of evolution. It\r\nhas become all the more necessary to lay the groundwork for cooperation and\r\ncoordination on a permanent basis.\r\nThe efforts of the CSCE notwithstanding, we are still quite far away from\r\nthe European order of peace which Germany has always championed. The dramatic\r\nchange in Europe has brought with it social tension, economic downturn,\r\nintolerance# xenophobia and aggressive nationalism, all of which underscore\r\nthe necessity to enforce the values to which all participating States\r\nsubscribe. To this end, the CSCE has created a body of instruments founded on\r\nmutual responsibility.\r\nProcedures for conflict prevention and crisis management within the CSCE\r\nframework, as adopted this summer in Helsinki, tie in with the instruments I\r\nhave mentioned. Missions dispatched by the CSCE and the impending activities\r\nof the High Commissioner for National Minorities make it possible to identify\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.49\r\n30\r\n(Mr. Graf zu Rantzau, Germany)\r\ncauses of conflict at an early stage and to support efforts towards their\r\nresolution. We all know that there is no room for complacency. The\r\ninstruments the CSCE has created for itself in Helsinki must be imbued with\r\nlife and must be used sensibly.\r\nFor the first time in decades, a war is raging in the CSCE region, which\r\ndemonstrates daily in a most dramatic fashion the need to improve and develop\r\nthe peace-keeping potential of existinq organizations, including the CSCE.\r\nGermany welcomes the draft resolution - which it is co-sponsoring - concerning\r\nthe coordination of the activities of the United Nations and the Conference on\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe. We are looking forward to the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General and shall actively participate in further discussions.\r\nI\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI\r\nAl471PV.49\r\n31\r\nMr. HUSLID (Norway): Let me start by saying how much we appreciate\r\nthe initiative taken by the Czech and S10vak Federal Republic, as\r\nChairman-in-Office of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(CSCE), in proposing this new item on the agenda of the General Assembly.\r\nAt the Helsinki Summit in July this year, the participating States,\r\nreaffirming their commitment to the Charter of the United Nations as\r\nsubscribed to by them, declared their understanding that the CSCE is a\r\nregional arrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the United Nations\r\nCharter and, as such, provides an important link between European and global\r\nsecurity. I should think that this is something that should be noted with\r\nsatisfaction here in the General Assembly also.\r\nThe CSCE, as the all-European institution, has a vital role to play in\r\nachieving a more peaceful and stable Europe. The conflict potential of the\r\n1990s includes, as we know, unfortunately, militant nationalism, xenophobia\r\nand intolerance. They pose the gravest threat to our common security. In\r\norder to deal with these new security problems, it is of the utmost importance\r\nto have effective mechanisms for crisis management and conflict prevention.\r\nThe CSCE Helsinki follow-up meeting did important work in this area, as\r\nreflected in the document adopted at the meeting. Thus, the establishment of\r\na CSCE peace-keeping capability represented an important step forward. This\r\nis an area in which the CSCE has much to learn from the United Nations.\r\nThe option of peace-keeping activities of various kinds should, in our\r\nview, be a key element of the overall conflict-prevention and\r\ncrisis-management capability of the CSCE, and would be a useful supplement to\r\nthe peace-keeping role of the United Nations.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.49\r\n32\r\n(Mr. Huslid. Norway)\r\nThe participating States regularly assess and monitor each other\u0027s\r\nimplementation of CSCE commitm~nts, including in the vital areas of democracy\r\nand human rightsm To this end, the CSCE h~s further developed structures to\r\nensure political management of crises and has created new instruments of\r\nconflict prevention ~,d crisis management. The CSCE\u0027s capacities in the field\r\nof early warning will be strengthened, in particular by the activities of the\r\nnewly established office of High Commissioner on National Minorities.\r\nThe United Nations and the CSCE can support and reinforce each other also\r\nin the area of preventive diplomacy.\r\nThe CSCE has supported the efforts of the United Nations in the tragic\r\nconflict in the former Yugoslavia, as we all know. The Norwegian Ambassador,\r\nMr. Tore Bogh, has been charged with the task of heading long-term missions to\r\nthe Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina. The CSCE has also shared in the\r\ninvestigation of human rights abuses and in assisting neighbouring States in\r\nthe rigorous enforcement of United Nations sanctions through the deployment of\r\nsanctions-assistance missions.\r\nI should like to mention one item to which we attach great importance.\r\nSecurity and stability have, in our view, obvious environmental dimensions.\r\nIn several parts of the CSCE area, environmental hazards stemming from\r\ndefence-related installations and activities are real and pressing concerns.\r\nMultilateral dialogue and cooperative action in this field is urgently\r\nrequired, as a complement to bilateral and multilateral efforts undertaken by\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe peacemakers of today are facing a big challenge. The United Nations\r\nand the CSCE have already established fruitful cooperation in this field. I\r\nam convinced that the area of cooperation between the two organizations will\r\nI\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI\r\nAl47/PV.49\r\n33\r\n(M!:.. Huslid, Norway)\r\nexpand and will lead to mutual benefit in a world which needs concerted action\r\nand the promotion of comprehensive security.\r\nAs one of the sponsors of the draf~ resolution on this item, we very much\r\nlQok forward to receivinq the Secretary-General\u0027s report on this aqenda item\r\nbefore next year\u0027s session of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. HOHENFELLNER (Austria): Austria supports the\r\nSecretary-General\u0027s view - expreslsed in \"An Aqenda for Peace\" that:\r\n\"reqional arranqements ••• in many cases possess a potential that should\r\nbe utilized\" (A/471277, para. 64)\r\nRecent experience has shown that the contributions of reqional arranqements\r\nare essential prerequisites for meetinq the tremendous challenqes to the\r\ninternational community in connection with the preservation and restoration of\r\ninternational peace and security. Reqional action could indeed in many cases\r\nresult in a deeper sense of participation, consensus and democratization in\r\ninternational affairs.\r\nAustria therefore welcomes the consideration of the new item\r\n\"Coordination of the activities of the United Nations and the Conference on\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe\".\r\nIndeed, the participatinq States in this reqional arranqement, which\r\nencon~asses 52 countries and a reqion from Vancouver to Vladivostok, have\r\nalr\u0027eady stated, in the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, their full and active\r\nsupport for the United Nations and for the enhancement of its role and\r\neffectiveness in strenqtheninq international peace, security and justice, and\r\nexpressed their common will to act in conformity with the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. Thus the CSCE was created in\r\na ~pirit of cooperation and support for the United Nations and with a desire\r\nto complement the activities of the United Nations.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.49\r\n34-35\r\n(Mr. Hohenfellner. Austria)\r\nFrom the heginning, the participating States of the CSCE have implemented\r\nmany of their commitments regarding economic and environmental cooperation in\r\nthe- framework of the Economic Commission for Europe.•\r\nThe CSCE has played an important role in bringing about political changes\r\nin Central and Eastern Europe by promoting human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms as well as democratic values and institutions. After the breakdown\r\nof communism in Central and Eastern Europe and the end of the East-West\r\nconflict, the European security architecture is undergoing profound changes.\r\nA concept of cooperative security is emerging, with the CSCE as its broadest\r\nplatform.\r\nAt the Helsinki Summit on 9 and 10 July 1992, this understanding was\r\nunderlined by the participating States, which declared that the CSCE was a\r\nregional arrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the United Nations\r\nCharter and, as such, would provide an important link between European and\r\nglobal security.\r\nClearly, the main fields for future cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the CSCE will be in preventive diplomacy, peacemaking,\r\npeace-keeping, and security matters.\r\nI\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI\r\nA/47/PV.49\r\n36\r\n(Mr. Bohenfellner, Austria)\r\nThe decisions taken at this year\u0027s CSCE summit established new\r\ninstruments of conflict prevention. The CSCE Committee of Senior Officials has\r\ncreated a mechanism for monitoring potential conflicts and the possibility of\r\ntaking preventive measures. Fact-finding and rapporteur missions can also be,\r\nand have already been, used as instruments of conflict prevention and crisis\r\nmanagement; one of them is \u003c;he mission to Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina. The\r\ngoal of this mission is to prevent a further expansion of the war in former\r\nYugoslavia and to guarantee a basic standard of human rights within these\r\nregions. A similar mission has been sent by the CSCE to Macedonia. The\r\nfindings of these missions will be transmitted on the basis of a decision of\r\nthe Committee of Senior Officials to the Geneva Conference, thereby\r\ndovetailing with the relevant United Nations efforts. Other examples of CSCE\r\nactivities in conflict prevention and crisis management are the Minsk peace\r\nprocess regarding Nagorny-Karabakh and the efforts concerning the situation in\r\nTransnistra, Moldava. There, too, the endeavours of the United Nations and\r\nthe CSCE can be most efficient when they are mutually supportive.\r\nAn important result of the Helsinki summit was the definition of general\r\ncriteria for CSCE peace-keeping operations. Such CSCE peace-keeping could be\r\nconducted in cooperation with other regional and transatlantic organizations.\r\nCertainly, the CSCE will benefit greatly from the experience and\r\nexpertise of the United Nations in this area, which, until recently was a\r\nmonopoly of the United Nations. This is another field which clearly\r\ndemonstrates the need for a concrete mechanism for coordination and\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe ongoing negotiati~ns in the framework of the CSCE Forum for Security\r\nCooperation, in Vienna, are particularly relevant for the development of\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.49\r\n37\r\n(Mr. Hohenfellner. Austrig)\r\nconfidence and security building, as well as disarmament. Also in these\r\nsecurity matters a steady e~~change of information would be of interest both to\r\nthe United Nations and to the CSCE.\r\nThe enlarged tasks and increased activities of the CSCE require enhanced\r\ncoordination and cooperation with the United Nations. The time may have come\r\nto reinforce this relations11ip, to mutual benefit, by establishing a\r\nstructured liaison mechanis13. Given the fact that most of the relevant CSCE\r\nbodies are established in Vienna, and also considering.the proximity of the\r\nCSCE secretariat in Prague to the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human\r\nRights in Warsaw, the United Nations Headquarters in Vienna would offer the\r\nmost efficient location for such a liaison mechanism.\r\nIn an era when, finally, the potential of Chapter VIII of the Charter can\r\nbe utilized it is time to take concrete steps to bring about the mutually and\r\nglobally advantageous effects of increased coordination and cooperation.\r\nMr. BATIQUK (Ukra.ne) (interpretation from Russian): The upheavals\r\nof the past few years have significantly changed the world political landscape\r\nand have put an end to a long era of mutual distrust and of confrontation\r\nbetween blocs. What is emerging is a new type of relationship based on peace,\r\npartnership, democracy and trust.\r\nToday the evidence of )ur own eyes convinces us that the successes of the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) are helpful in solving\r\nthe problems faced by the United Nations and that the achievements of the\r\nUnited Nations are revivifying the pan-European process.\r\nAs an East European St!te, Ukraine is a consistent advocate of real\r\naction aimed at achieving t~e unification of Europe, overcoming the remnants\r\nof mistrust and suspicion and finding speedy solutions to the conflicts which\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nI\r\nA/~7/PV.49\r\n38\r\n(Mr. Batiouk.

The cllange from\r\nmilitary stability based on confrontation to stability in the new pan-European\r\npost-confrontation dimension is a major trend in today\u0027S world. But its\r\nrealization will not be simple, nor will it be painless, because everything\r\nnew is born in travail.\r\nUkraine, which does not separate its security from that of Europe as a\r\nwhole, feels deep concern at the fact that in our region there have arisen a\r\nnumbor of conflicts in which the basic principles of CSCE are being trampled,\r\nobligations in the area of human rights and fundamental freedoms are being\r\nviolated and the peaceful d3velopment of new democratic States is threatened.\r\nThis is demonstrated by the tragic events in former Yugoslavia and some areas\r\nof the former Soviet Union.\r\nUkraine\u0027s contribution to the establishment of a system of collective\r\nsecurity in Europe is one of the major aspects ~,~ :~S foreign policy. We feel\r\nthat participation in such a system is the most reliable guarantee of our\r\nnational sovereignty, as well as a safeguard for the security of all new\r\ndemocratic States. As we see it, such a system should be universal and\r\nall-encompassing. Attempts to establish military-political structures of any\r\nkind on a regional or subre}ional basis in the circumstanceB of today\u0027c Europe\r\nare fraught with the threat of a return to the 010 bloc mentality.\r\nFor that reason, we attach great importance to increasing the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in maintaining peace and to the new pan-European security\r\nsystem, which includes elements that are being developed or improved at the\r\npresent time.

The San Francisco Confer( -\u0027lce, which drafted the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, emphasized the importance of regional\r\nagreements or bodies for solving problems pertaining to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nIn practical terms such cooperation has already been developing for a\r\nlong time in many parts of the world•. The United Nations and CSCE have now\r\nfelt it necessary to coordinate the activities of the two systems, and it is\r\ngratifying that the item now before us has been formulated in just this way.\r\nAs regards Europe, CSCE and the United Nations complement each other and\r\nshould act together, setting an example for problem-solving.\r\nEven though the United Nations is much older than CSCE, it can still\r\nborrow from the latter\u0027s experience. For example, in CSCE we have found a\r\nmuch fairer approach to solving the problem of apportioning the contributions\r\nof the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics than the approach currently\r\nbeing recommended in the United Nations.\r\nSince the Helsinki summit in July 1992, CSCE has begun to serve as a\r\nmechanism for solving European problems by reconciling the parties before they\r\nresort to violence. The decisions taken at the Helsinki summit have provided\r\nthe pan-European process with a large variety ef peacemaking instruments\r\nranging from fact-finding missions to peace-keeping operations, also making\r\nuse, if necessary, of the potential of such international organizations as the\r\nEuropean Community, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the\r\nWestern European Union (WEU).\r\nAt the same time, the new problems confronting CSCE today require not\r\nonly the active use of regional peacemaking instruments but also closer\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.49\r\n42\r\n(Mr. Batiouk, Ukraine)\r\nrelations with the United Nations. We are convinced that coordinating the\r\nefforts of the United Nations a».d CSCE, which is a regional arrangement within\r\nthe meaning of Chapter VIII ot the Charter of the United Nations, can and must\r\nlead to finding effective solutions for conflict and crisis settlement in the\r\nEuropean region. Only then will it be possible to have a reliable\r\nrelationship between security in Europe and global security.\r\nDraft resolution A/47/L.ll, of which Ukraine is a sponsor, is intended to\r\ngive practical implementation to the provisions of Ch~pter VIII of the\r\nCharter, which makes clear the importance of close cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional arrangements and organizations in crisis\r\nprevention and settlement.\r\nOur country, regarding participation in European structures as one of the\r\nmost important areas of its foreign policy, is prepared for the closest\r\npossible cooperation in establishing fruitful relations between the United\r\nNations and CSCE.\r\nThe PRE~IDENT: I should like to propose that the list of speakers\r\nin the debate on agenda item 140 should be closed now.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. TURK (Slovenia): The current consideration by the General\r\nAssembly of questions relating to the coordination of the activities of tha\r\nUnited Nations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)\r\ncalls for at least two preliminary comments ••\r\n* Mr. Hayes (Ireland), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.49\r\n43\r\n(Mr. TUrk. Sloyenia)\r\nThe first comment concerns the original idea of regional arrangements as\r\nenshrined in Articles 52 to 54 of the United Nations Charter, which clearly\r\nenvisage a role for the regional organizations within the broader framework of\r\nthe United Nations. According to Article 52,\r\n\"Nothing in the present Charter precludes the existence of regional\r\narrangements or agencies\".\r\nMoreover, the Charter deliberately avoids any definition of regional\r\narrangements, thus allowing for very useful flexibility. This feature is\r\nimportant and is duly recognized in the Secretary-General\u0027s report \"An Agenda\r\nfor Peace\", in paragraph 61.\r\nThe wording of Articles 52 to 54 of the Charter clearly puts the main\r\naccent on the role of regional arrangements in matters falling within the\r\ncompetence of the Security Council. However, it does not, in fact, limit the\r\nrole of regional arrangements to such matters. Flexibility has been envisaged\r\nfrom the time when the United Nations was created. It is important to accept\r\nthe fact that the nature of regional arrangements may change-over time - in\r\nthe context of changed circumstances. Some regional arrangements may become\r\nobsolete, while others may gain completely new roles and competence which go\r\nbeyond the original design.\r\nThe CSCE is a very good example of such a change. Its recent Summit\r\nDeclaration and decisions adopted in Helsinki on 10 July 1992 demonstrate the\r\nwide scope of the recent change in Europe and the consequent attempt to adjust\r\nEurope\u0027s most representative regional arrangement to the new circumstances.\r\nThis leads me to the second preliminary observation concerning the\r\ninterpretation of Articles 52 to 54 of the Charter: how should the United\r\nNations utilize the potential of regional arrangements in the changing\r\ninternational environment?\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nW471!?V.49\r\n44\r\n(Mr. TUrk, Slovenia)\r\nAn interpretation which would limit this potential to the framework\r\ndefined in Article 53 of the Charter - that is, utilization of regional\r\narrangements by the Security Council for enforcement action - would certainly\r\nfall short of actual needs. In order fully to utilize the potential of these\r\narrangements and to achie,re the maximum effect it is necessary to develop a\r\ncontinuous and productive dialogue focused on those issues which can be best\r\nunderstood within the regional arrangements. Full advantage must be taken of\r\nthe fact that regional arrangements, as a rule, provide an important\r\nopportunity for understanding local circumstances, the roots and the history\r\nof a given problem, and possible solutions. It is not necessary that such a\r\ndialogue with regional arrangements be made contingent upon any formal\r\nstipulation. The important requirement here is that it be conducted in\r\naccordance with the principles of the Charter an~ that it yield proper and\r\npractical results. The relationship between t\u0027h~ Un\u0027\u003d\"ted Nations and regional\r\ninstitutions should not be seen as one of subordination but, rather, as one of\r\ncooperation and dialogue.\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the expanding role of the CSCE process expressed\r\nthe nature of change within that regional arrangement. The 1992 Helsinki\r\nDocument, entitled \"The Challenges of Change\", expresses all those\r\ncharacteristics of change. Heads of State and Government of the CSCE\r\nparticipating countries have placed a large part of their expectations on the\r\nfuture development of institutional mechanisms of the CSCE process; on methods\r\nof preventive diplomacy; on expanded action in the field of human rights and\r\ndemocracy, including questions relating to minorities; on economic\r\ncooperation; and on the protection of the environment. All this has made the\r\nCSCE agenda very ambitious and p~omising, and also similar to the agenda\r\nbefore the United Nations.\r\n--~ -------- --------_.._------\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.49\r\n45\r\n(Mr. TUrk, Slovenia)\r\nClearly, much of this new CSCE agenda is still at the level of relatively\r\n\"\r\ngeneral iaeas or at the initial stage of institutional evolution. Moreover,\r\nCSCE has not always been able to succeed in its efforts to translate its\r\nobjectives and principles into effective international action. Efforts made\r\nin the overall context of the Balkan crisis and in other crises in the CSCE\r\narea provide examples of the difficulties encountered. The President of the\r\nPresidency of Slovenia, Mr. Milan KuMan, in his address to the General\r\nAssenmly on 24 Septeltiber 1992, offered an analysis of the limited success of\r\nthe CSCE in dealing with the Balkan crisis and suggested certain measures\r\nwhich might help in finding a solution. We believe that coordination between\r\nthe CSCE and the United Nations is important in this context.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.49\r\n46\r\n(Mr. Turk, SlQvenia)\r\nTurning again to more general questions of coordination between the CSCE\r\nand the United Nations, the delegation of Slovenia agrees wi.th the approach to\r\nthese questions outlined a few weeks ago, in the context of the general debate\r\nby his excellency Mr. Jozef Moravcik, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech\r\nand Slovak Federal Republic. and current Chairman-in-Office of the CSCE\r\nCouncil of Ministers, who suggested that the discussion on the issue should\r\ndevelop at two levels: first, on the conceptual level, to clarify the\r\nfundamental political meaning of coordination, both in the immediate future\r\nand in the light of medium and long-term prospects; and. secondly, on the\r\npractical and concrete level. that is, those cases where these activities of\r\nthe United Nations and the CSCE have already begun to overlap. and to draw\r\nconclusions from such overlapping. While we generally agree with the approach\r\noutlined by Minister Moravcik we wish to point out that the discussion should\r\nconcentrate on the issues arising at the level of concrete activities which\r\nwill. in turn. help in devising appropriate approaches at the more general,\r\ni.e •• conceptual level.\r\nLet us take only two examples. While considering various security\r\nquestions concerning the CSCE area, the Security Council could take full\r\nadvantage of the analyses and opinions developed within the CSCE framework. To\r\nthat effect. it might be useful to invite the representative of the\r\nChairman-in-Office of the CSCE Council of Ministers to participate in\r\ndeliberations of the Security Council concerning those situations in the CSCE\r\narea that are under consideration by the Security Council. The General\r\nAssembly could. while considering any situation in the CSCE area. pay\r\nparticular attention to the opinions that might be expressed by the\r\nrepresentative of the Chairman-in-Office of the CSCE Council of Ministers.\r\nAnother specific example relates to activities in the field of human rights\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.49\r\n47\r\n(Mr. Turk, Slovenia)\r\nwhere increasing attention is placed - within both the United Nations and the\r\nCSCE - on the issues affecting national minorities. It is interesting that\r\nthe CSCE participating States have agreed on the establishment of the office\r\nof High Commissioner on National Minorities. Undoubtedly, the future high\r\ncommissioner will be able to draw from experience accumulated in United\r\nNations action in the field of human rights, in particular in such domains as\r\nfact-finding and reporting on human rights violations. It seems, therefore,\r\nthat cooperation between the High Commissioner and the United Nations Centre\r\nfor Human Rights in Genev\u0026 and various United Nations expert bodies would be\r\nof great value to the CSCE High Commissioner.-\r\nAn additional thought which might be considered as relevant, in\r\nparticular with regard to the latter of the two examples- the one concerning\r\nhuman rights and minorities - would be recogniti~n of the need to expand the\r\nanalytical infractructure, general knowledge of the issues at hand, and\r\nSecretariat assistance to the newly established organs or to other organs that\r\nhave been recently endowed with ambitious tasks and serious workloads.\r\nFulfilment of such tasks will not be possible without a ~ertain amount of\r\ninvestment and without mobilization of additional human resources. It would\r\nprobably be premature to discuss these aspects of the increased international\r\nagenda at this stage. However, we believe that at some point they should be\r\nconsidered in the context of discussions on coordination between the United\r\nNations and the CSCE. Let me conclude by saying that Sloveniua joins with\r\npleasure the other sponsors of the draft resolution on coordination between\r\nthe United Nations and the CSCE proposed by the delegation of Czechoslovakia.\r\nMr. FLOREAN (Romania): The Romanian delegation welcomes the\r\ninitiative of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic to include on the agenda\r\nof the current session of the General Assembly the item entitled:\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.49\r\n48\r\n(Mr. Florean. Romania)\r\n\"Coordination of the activities of the United Nations and the Conference on\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe\". Indeed, in the context of new trends in\r\nthe international arena as a result of the cessation of the cold war, the\r\nquestion of interaction between the United Nations and the Conference on\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) has become very topical and acquired\r\na new dimension, especially after the CSCE Summit in Helsinki in early July\r\n1992. This has been underlined by the representatives of many countries, both\r\nin the general debate in the plenary of the General Assembly and in the\r\npresent debate. In this connection, a valuable source of inspiration and\r\nreflection is the important report of the Secretary-General \"An Agenda for\r\nPeace\", in which is highlighted the cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional arrangements and organizations. The ideas expressed in the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General reflect the need for both the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations to play a greater role in the field of the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security, in particular through preventive\r\ndiplomacy. There is no doubt that the time has come to revitalize Chapter\r\nVIII of the Charter by ex\u0026~ining practical ways and means to encourage\r\nrecourse to regional organizations and, their cooperation with the United\r\nNations in the prevention and settlement of regional conflicts.\r\nAs was very rightly pointed out in the report of the Secretary-General:\r\n\"regional arrangements or agencies in many cases possess a potential that\r\nshould be utilized in serving the functions covered in this report:\r\npreventive diplomacy, peace-keeping, peacemaking and post-conflict\r\npeace-building. Under the Charter, the Security Council has and will\r\ncontinue to have primary responsibility for maintaining international\r\npeace and security, but regional action as a matter of decentralization,\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nW47.1PV.49\r\n49-50\r\n(Mr. Florean, Romania)\r\ndelegation and cooperation with United Nations efforts could not only\r\nlighten the burden of the Council but also contribute to a deeper sense\r\nof participation, consensus and democratization in international\r\naffairs\". (A/47/277? para. 64)\r\nThe consultations envisaged between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations can greatly contribute to building international consensus on\r\nthe nature ofi a problem or group of problems and the measures required to\r\naddress them. This is particularly true in the post-cold-war period when\r\nregional organizations can play a crucial role in the field of international\r\npeace and security if their activities and functioning are conce~ved and\r\nundertaken in conformity with the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation shares the hope expressed by other\r\ndelegations that in the future the CSCE will be more effective in the\r\nprevention of conflicts in Europe. The Helsinki document adopted in July this\r\nyear clearly recognizes that the CSCE is a regional arrangement according to\r\nChapter VIII of the United Nations Charter that provides an important link\r\nbetween European and global security. We are encouraged in this sense by the\r\nfact that the set of major agreements signed or entered into force this year\r\nat the European level - the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe\r\n(CFE), the Vienna Document, the Helsinki Final Act on Conventional Armed\r\nForces, and the open skies Treaty - have laid the foundation for lasting\r\ncooperation and stability on the Continent. At the same time, the opening in\r\nVienna in September 1992 of the Forum for Security Cooperation launches a\r\nfurther stage in the dialogue among the CSCE participating States in their\r\njoint endeavour for increased security and stability for each and every\r\ncountry in the Euro-Atlantic area.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.49\r\n51\r\n(Mr. Florean, Romania)\r\nThe outcome of Romania\u0027s important efforts to restore and consolidate\r\ndemocracy in our country will be closely linked with the international\r\nenvironment, stability and security, both at the European and at the global\r\nlevel. In order to contribute to the strengthening of that stability and\r\nsecurity, Romania is actively developing relations of cooperation with all\r\ncountries on the continent and in particular with its neighbours. Romanian\r\nforeign policy is pursued along irrevocable lines defined within the\r\nEuro-Atlantic space and its viable institutions. Simultaneously, we are\r\nincreasing our contribution to building up the Euro-Atlantic community of\r\nvalues and a new continental security order. Romania is engaged in\r\nnegotiations on an association agreement with the European Community which is\r\nabout to be conclud9d, and on a cooperation agreement with the European Free\r\nTrade Association.\r\nAt the bilateral level, Romania recently signed new treaties free of\r\nideological clauses with France, Germany, Bulgaria, Spain, Greece and Estonia;\r\nnegotiations are under way with other States, with the same aim.\r\nMy delegation would like to stress that Romania is also developing its\r\nrelationships with regional organizations from other continents, mindful of\r\ntheir contribution to the maintainance of international peace and security.\r\nWe value the activities of the Organization of American States, in which\r\nRomania is an observer, as well as the efforts of the Organization for African\r\nUnity, the Association of South-East Asian Nations and the League of Arab\r\nStates to promote cooperation in their respective regions.\r\nIn fact, the item we are discussing today is just one of a series of\r\nsimilar subjects before the General Assembly. I have !.n mind the items\r\nconcerning the organizations I have just mentioned, as well as the item\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.49\r\n52\r\n(Mr. Florean, Romania)\r\ndevoted to cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference.\r\nThe Forum created at the Helsinki ~,ummit is a siqnificant step towards\r\nensuring, as part of an overall approach, resolute concentration of political\r\nattention at the regional level on security issues. It provides for efforts\r\nin areas such as arms control and disarmament, confidence- and\r\nsecurity-building measures, implementation and verification of existing\r\ntreaties in this field, conversion of military complexes, and the\r\nestablishment of flexible forms of cooperation with other European and\r\nEuro-Atlantic structures. The CSCE Forum for security through cooperation\r\nshould seek balanced solutions which would benefit general European security,\r\nthe security of all subregions of Europe and the security of all participant\r\nStates.\r\nAll these activites and efforts are conceived as an integral part of\r\nworld security and of United Nations endeavours in that direction. In fact,\r\nas we said, the security of any country of the region is inconceivable today\r\nexcept as a result of harmonious interaction among the United Nations, the\r\nCSCE, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union,\r\nalong with increased efforts at the subregional level.\r\nThat is why the initiative of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic to\r\nbring before the General Assembly the subject of coordinating the activities\r\nof the United Nations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\nis very useful and of high topicality.\r\nRomania is a sponsor of the draft resolution submitted on this matter,\r\nwhich emphasizes that the new tasks before the CSCE require enhanced\r\ncoordination and cooperation with international organizations, in particular\r\nwith the United Nations.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.49\r\n53\r\n(Mr. Fiorean. Romania)\r\nOur delegation is fully convinced, having seen the spirit of today\u0027s\r\ndebate and the great interest shown by many delegations which have advanced\r\nideas stimulating further reflection, that the conclusions that will come from\r\nthe consideration of this item will be very useful for the Secretary-General\r\nas he prepares the report on this item to be submitted to the General Assembly\r\nat its fourty-eighth session.\r\nWe are confident that, by opening today a new way for exploring the best\r\nmeans for harmonious interaction between the United Nations and the CSCE, we\r\nwill all together be contributing to the creation of a universal system of\r\ncollective security and to the enhancement of the effectiveness of the world\r\nOrganization.\r\nMrs. FRECHETTE (Canada): The draft resolution before us today\r\naddresses the issue of cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). The draft\r\nresolution, of which Canada is a sponsor, reflects the growing expectation -\r\nindeed, the growing reality - that regional organizations will in the future\r\nbe mandated to carry out and be capable of carrying out greater peace and\r\nsecurity functions such as peacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-building.\r\nAlready the proliferation of tensions and conflicts across Europe has\r\ntested the mutually supportive efforts of the CSCE and the United Nations. In\r\nthe former Yugoslavia, in the conflict in Nagorny-Karabakh, in Moldova and in\r\nGeorgia, the CSCE currently plays a key role alongside the United Nations. In\r\nthe specific case of Nagorny-Karabakh, the CSCE has taken a lead role in the\r\nsearch for a settlement.\r\nIn its 1992 Helsinki document, the CSCE declared itself a regional\r\narrangement within the framework of Chapter VIII of the United Nations\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl471PV.49\r\n54\r\n(Mrs. Frechette, Canada)\r\nCharter. The definition of the CSCE\u0027s role within the broader context of the\r\nCharter is particularly important.\r\nCanada has always envisaged a close relationship between the CSCE and the\r\nUnited Nations: a relationship in which the CSCE reinforces regionally United\r\nNations peace and security efforts as well as broader United Nations efforts\r\non democracy and human rights.\r\nWithin the CSCE, our efforts have been concentrated on developing the\r\nmeans for effective conflict-management mechanisms by establishing a range of\r\ninstruments from fact-finding and good offices to mediation. Canada pioneered\r\nthe idea of CSCE peace-keeping as a necessary element in the spectrum of CSCE\r\nconflict-management mechanisms. We have sought with other CSCE partners to\r\nstrengthen commitments on minorities, tolerance and democratic development.\r\nWe believe this approach complements the type of conflict-management proposals\r\noutlined in \"An Agenda for Peace\".\r\nDocumentation of the CSCE recognizes the primacy of United Nations\r\nCharter commitments and the centrality of the United Nations role in\r\npeacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-building. The CSCE\u0027s role in support of\r\nthe United Nations is especially important when one considers the recent\r\nestablishment of a framework for CSCE peace-keeping: CSCE peace-keeping will\r\nbe undertaken with due regard for the responsibilities of the United Nations\r\nin this field.\r\nIt is Canada\u0027s belief that that the CSCE\u0027s Y~st effective work in terms\r\nof conflict management can likely be accomplished in the area of preventive\r\ndiplomacy. The CSCE provides a flexible instrument for the quick dispatch of\r\nfact-finding and observer missions, as shown by the manner in which the CSCE\r\nwas able in early September quickly to mobilize observers to detention camps\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina and expeditiously report its findings.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nte, Canada}\r\next of the\r\nSCE and the\r\nally United\r\n5 efforts\r\ning the\r\ni range of\r\nl pioneered\r\nun of CSCE\r\n~ners to\r\n.opment.\r\n. proposals\r\nons\r\nupport of\r\n:::ent\r\n?ing will\r\nNations\r\n.n terms\r\n\u0027entive\r\npatch of\r\nhe CSCE\r\nn camps\r\na\r\nA/47/PV.49\r\n55\r\n(Mrs. Frechette, Canada)\r\nMy delegation welcomes the initiative taken by the Czech and Slovak\r\nFederal Republic, as current Chairman-in-Office of the CSCE, in proposing this\r\nnew agenda item for the General Assembly. The initiative is very much in line\r\nwith the ideas espoused by the Secretary-General on the mutually supportive\r\nroles of the United Nations and regional organizations, ideas which are set\r\nout in \"An Agenda for Peace\". Thus, we welcome the debate which has been\r\ninitiated today.\r\nIn a statement to this Assembly earlier this month, my delegation offered\r\nsuggestions for establishing practical ties between the United Nations and\r\nregional organizations with a view to developing a shared sense of commitment\r\nto global peace, security and development. We anticipate that the debate\r\ninitiated here today will be pursued further in future sessions. It is our\r\nhope that these discussions will help develop tangible ways for the United\r\nNations to forge links with regional organizations.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.49\r\n56\r\nMr. WLOSOWICZ (Poland): After the initial enthusiasm following the\r\nfundamental transformations in the world, the international ~ommunity soon\r\nrealized that it had to adjust itself, its structures and its institutions to\r\nthe new situation. In various parts Gf the world those profound changes have\r\nbeen accompanied by instability, outbreaks of local conflicts and the\r\nunleashing of extreme nationalism. Such developments seriously challenge the\r\nexisting systems of collective security. The disappearance of the immediate\r\nthreat of a global military conflict has also considerably changed the\r\nperception of security. Not only has it become more regional-oriented, but it\r\nnow also encompasses other, mainly non-military, aspects.\r\nAs the number and complexity of challenges have increased, the\r\ninternational community - above all the United Nations - has begun\r\nconsideration of ways and means to strengthen its ability to respond to them\r\nmore quickly and in a more comprehensive manner. A number of regional\r\norganizations, as well as groups of States, have followed suit. Multiple and\r\nparallel efforts have been made to deal with the same tensions or conflicts.\r\nSince similar developments have also taken place in Europe, the idea has\r\nemerged that it would be advisable to coordinate the efforts and activities of\r\nthe organizations involved - in this case the United Nations and the\r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). In this connection,\r\nPoland values highly the example of coordination initiated by the London\r\nConference concerning the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nToday, thanks to the Czech and Slovak Feder~l Republic, which formulated\r\nthe idea and initiated the process of its inclusion on the agenda of the\r\nforty-seventh session of the General Assembly, we have an opportunity to\r\nconsider certain aspo~ts of the coordination of activities of the United\r\nNations and the CSCE.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nW47/PV,49\r\n57\r\n(Mr, Wlosowicz, Polapd)\r\nThe present political climate permits a more effective exercise of th~\r\nUnited Nations function of preserving global peace and security. This task of\r\nthe United Nations has to be consolidated. However, the Organization cannot,\r\nfor practical reasons, assume full responsibility for dealing with each and\r\nevery regional conflict. Therefore, a regionalization of efforts seems to be\r\nrequired.\r\nParagraph 25 of the Helsinki Summit Declaration should be seen in this\r\ncontext. That is also consistent with section VII of \"An Agenda for Peace\",\r\nin particular with paragraph 64, which speaks of decentralization, delegation\r\nand cooperation, and a contribution to a deeper sense of participation,\r\nconsensus and democratization in international affairs.\r\nPoland supports efforts to develop and strengthen cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations or arrangements. As the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland, Mr. Krzysz~~! Skubisze~ki,\r\nstated in the general debate, such harmonious and constructive i~taraction\r\nmight well constitute an important element in making the United Nations more\r\neffective in the field of peace and security. In this connection, he\r\nsuggested that\r\n\"In crisis situations, where several organizations are acting\r\nsimultar\u0027-ously, it could be advisable to set up, on an ad-hoc basis, a\r\nsingle cuordinati:.ng framework\",\r\nthus helping\r\n\"to avoid duplication, overlapping or dissifation of efforts.\"\r\n(A/47/PV.7, p. 79)\r\nThe United Nations should observe closely the development of CSCE\r\nmechanisms and structures, especially those for peaceful settlement of\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47/PV.49\r\n58\r\n(Mr. WIQSQwicz.

This would not imply any direct dependence of the\r\nCSCE on the United Nations, but would simply constitute a means of channelling\r\ninformation Qn matters of interest to both the CSCE and the United NatiQns.\r\nOther regiQnal arrangements and organizations might also consider using this\r\nexperience. Consequently, the General Assembly might appeal to other regional\r\norganizations to contemplate the possibility of tightening their liaisQn with\r\nthe United Nations, taking into account the CSCE experience.\r\nIt has to be stated clearly that the purpose of this decentralization is\r\ntQ use the most efficient means tQ solve regiQnal problems. In many instances\r\nregional means may prQve to be adequate. We believe that the CSCE has the\r\nnecessary potential to address complex issues in a satisfactory manner. This\r\nWQuld also lighten the burden on the United Nations structures.\r\nThe CSCE, as a regional arrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the\r\nCharter, is establishing a pattern of relationships with other EurOpeatl and\r\ntransatlantic organisms. This is also conducive to the emergence Qf an\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.49\r\n59-60\r\n(Mr. WlosQwiez, Poland)\r\nefficient system of European security - for example, a system of mutually\r\nreinforcing European institutions. The way in which European institutions\r\nhandle this issue may also be of interest to the United Nations, as well as to\r\nother regions.\r\nMr. LOZINSKIY (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian):\r\nThe question of cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and\r\nthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) is particularly\r\ntimely today. CSCE is destined to become a leading pan-European organization\r\nand a centre for coordinating the interests of European States in the\r\npolitical, economic, humanitarian, ,environmental and other areas.\r\nThe decisions taken at the Helsinki meeting of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of member StctGS of CSCE imbue the pan-European p~ocess with new\r\nsubstantive content in all major areas of its activity. In CSCE we are\r\nestablishing and putting into operation machinery for conflict and crisis\r\nprevention and settlement through collective efforts.\r\nThe proclamation of CSCE as a regional arrangement within the meaning of\r\nChapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations necessitates close\r\ncoordination between the two organizations in peace-keeping.\r\nAt the present stage the most important questions in cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and eSCE are urgent practical questions pertaining first\r\nand foremost to the need for settling the increasing and extremely painfUl\r\nconflicts in the European region, as well as in Asian countries of the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States. The experience of international\r\npeace-keeping activities in Yugoslavia, Nagorny-Karabakh, South Ossetia,\r\nAbkhazia and the Dniester region shows that the effectiveness of the efforts\r\nundertaken will depend to a great extent on the degree of coordination and\r\ncooperation between various international structures.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PVe 49\r\n61\r\n(Mr. Lozinskiy. Russian Federation)\r\nOf course, the subject of cooperation between the United Natio~8 and CSCE\r\nshould not be limited to peacemaking activities, although they are its major\r\naspect. There is considerable pGtential for joint action in other areas as\r\nwell: the protection of human rights and the promotion of democratic\r\ninstitutions and a market economy in countries which are in a period of\r\ntransition.\r\nAccordingly, we might consider granting CSCE Observer status in the\r\nUnited Nations, thereby enabling representatives of the Conference to\r\nparticipate in the work of the General Assembly and its subsidiary organs and\r\nalso promoting harmony in the growing cooperation between the two\r\norganizations.\r\nA central element of the interaction, as we see it, should be mutual\r\nsupport in maintaining peace and security in Europe and throughout the world.\r\nIt seems essential that the rights and obligations of the united Nations\r\nSecurity Council should remain fully inviolable and that its capabilities\r\nshould be increased through the growing potential of CSCE.\r\nOne of the key areas of such cooperation is that of CSCE peace-keeping\r\noperations, which should be carried out with due regard for the role of the\r\nUnited Nations, in full conformity with the purposes and principles of its\r\nCharter. At Russia\u0027s initiative, the Helsinki decisions included a provision\r\npursuant to which the Chairman of the Council of CSCE will fully inform the\r\nSecurity Council of CSC\u0026 peace-keeping missions.\r\nIn our view, in conducting such operations, it would be appropriate to\r\ntake maximum account of the wealth of experience accumulated in the conduct of\r\nsuch operations by the United Nations. To that end, we believe it useful to\r\nhold a workinq meeting between experts of CSCE and the United Nations in order\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV~49\r\n62\r\n(Mr. Lozinskiy, Russian Federation)\r\nto exchange relevant information. Obviously, we should also consider the\r\nbroa~er participation in this work of experts from other international\r\norganizations, in particular the Commonwealth of Independent States, the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization, the European Community and the Western European\r\nUnion. In the future, we might perhaps think also about conducting joint\r\nUnited Nations-CSCE peace-keeping operations in the European region.\r\nAlso timely is the issue of combining United Nations and CSCE peacemaking\r\nmissions. It is no secret that in a number of cases some overlapping of those\r\nmissions has been found. We believe that there is some justification for\r\nestablishing, on the basis of the Vienna Conflict Prevention Centre, an\r\nappropriate coordination mechanism to achieve some sort of division of labour\r\nbetween the United Nations and CSCE. In the future, we might also consider\r\nputting into practice instructions or recommendations of the United Nations to\r\neSCE as a regional organization in peace-keeping matters.\r\nThere is Cl. perceived need to strengthen cooperation through CSCE\u0027s Office\r\nfor Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, headquartered at Warsaw, and the\r\nUnited Nations Commission on Human Rights. A broader and more efficient\r\nexchange of information between them will help to enhance the effectiveness of\r\ntheir work.\r\nAnother promising area for interaction between the United Nations and\r\nCSCE might be cooperation between CSCE\u0027s Economic Forum, which is part of the\r\nCommittee of Senior Officials, and the United Nations Enonomic Commission for\r\nEurope, in particular with a view to assisting States members of CSCE in\r\ncarrying out economic reforms. We would deem it appropriate for United\r\nNations experts to participate in the work of the meeting of the CSCE Economic\r\nForum to be held at Prague from 16 to 18 March 1993.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.49\r\n63\r\n(Mr. L02inskiy. Russian Federation)\r\nAlso of gr~at importance ~oul~ be the establishment of a regular exchange\r\nof information between the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the\r\nCSCE secretariat. It seems useful to include items pertaining to basic areas\r\nof CSCE activity in the agenda of various United Nations organs on a regular\r\nbasis. We might also consider est~~lishing it as a practice that the Chairman\r\nof CSCE should make statements at the sessions of the General Assembly and\r\nappointing plenipotentiary representatives of CSCE to United Nations\r\nHeadquarters at New York and of the United Nations to the CSCE secretariat at\r\nPrague.\r\nWe are convinced that the adoption of the General Assembly resolution on\r\nthis item (Al47/L.ll), of which the Russian Federation is a sponsor, will be\r\nan important step in setting into motion machinery for cooperation and\r\ncoordination between the two organizations.\r\nMr. ERDeS (Hungary) (interpretation from French): The Conference on\r\nSecurity and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) has come a long way from the\r\nHelsinki Final Act in 1915 to the Helsinki Document of 1992. In the 1992\r\nDocument, the Heads of State or Government of the States participating in CSCE\r\ndeclared that they consider the Conference to be a regional arrangement in the\r\nsense of Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nOver the past 17 years of its existence, the Helsinki process has become\r\nan integral part of European relations and an indispensable and inseparable\r\ncomponent of them. Following a process of detente that began in the early\r\n1970s, and in the conditions that have prevailed in a Europe affected by the\r\nYalta divisions and living in the shadow of the nuclear threat, the leaders of\r\n35 countries signed a comprehensive document, unique of its kind, covering\r\npolitical, security, economic, environmental, humanitarian and human-rights\r\nissues, thus encomp~ssing every possible dimension of security. In\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nAl47/PV.49\r\n64-65\r\n(Mr. Erdos, Hungar~)\r\nretrospect, it may seem paradoxical that it was precisely a bipolar Europe,\r\nsubject to an ideological confrontation unequaled in history, that was the\r\nfirst among the regions of the world to be able to achieve such a degree of\r\nconsensus and cooperation, which, while not serving as a model or a gauge,\r\nco~ld become a source of inspiration for the other continents of our world.\r\nThe decalogue of principles of the Final Act governing relations among\r\nthe participating States has become a true code of conduct for pan-European\r\ncooperation. In this context, I should like in particular to point out that\r\nthe Document signed at the Finnish capital over a decade and a half ago has\r\nproved to be a useful tool in the efforts to break through the spiritual and\r\nphysical ramparts surrounding the closed societies of Eastern Europe - efforts\r\nwhich ultimately led to th~ crumbling of those fossilized structures.\r\nContrary to everyone\u0027s expectations, the Helsinki Final Act thus became a tool\r\nnot for freezing but for negating the socio-political status quo that emerged\r\nfrom the Yalta accords. Today we must fully recognize these undeniable\r\nhistoric merits of CSCE.\r\nThe Helsinki process played an irreplaceable role in the early 1980s,\r\nwhen the Follow-up Meeting and the Expert Meeting of CSCE served, despite the\r\nups and downs of the period, to maintain the East-West dialogue. The adoption\r\nof the Charter of Paris for a New Europe in November 1990, proclaiming the\r\nvision of a free, united, democratic and prosperous Europe, already reflected\r\nthe winds of change that were sweeping the old totalitarian structures from\r\nthe continent.\r\nDigitized by Dag Hammarskjöld Library\r\nA/47 /PV .49\r\n66\r\n(Mr. Erdos, Hungary)\r\nThe participants in the CSCE have, since the beginning of the process,\r\nbeen fully aware of the close links between peace and security in Europe and\r\nin the world. They have on more than one occasion affirmed their full support\r\nfor the United Nations and for the strengthening of its role and its\r\nliar that,\r\nptlightin\r\nlited Nati\r\neffectiveness in consolidating international peace, security and justice. In\r\nthe Paris Charter, the participants in the CSCE reiterated their commitment to\r\nthe United Nations and emphasized the commonality of the destinies of their\r\nown nations and of all the nations the world over. The expressed their\r\nsolidarity with all the other countries of the world and declared themselves\r\nready to embark with them on a joint effort to protect and promote common,\r\nfundamental human values.\r\nThe historic changes that have taken place in the world, particularly in\r\nEurope, have created fundamentally new conditions for the CSCE to operate.\r\nSince it began, the Helsinki process has demonstrated its ability to be\r\nflexible, to adapt and to innovate. Today, now that the cold war is over,\r\nChapter VIII of the Charter is regaining its true meaning and its place in the\r\narmamentarium available to the United Nations for settling conflicts.\r\nRegional agreements and bodies can now play a primary role in the\r\nsettlement of local conflicts. We believe that the CSCE is a high-quality\r\ninstrument whose capabilities are still to be explored and which will be\r\ncapable of rising to the new challenges and of bringing its own, stabilizing\r\ncontribution to bear in its own region.\r\nThe latest international developments have made coordination and\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the CSCE even more imperative. I\r\nneed mention as an example only the activities of the United Nations and the\r\nCSCE in the former Yugoslavia, in the Karabakh region and in Georgia.
