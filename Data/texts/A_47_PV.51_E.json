Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.45 a.m. \r\nAGENDA ITEM 21 \r\nCOOPERATION BETWEEN THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES \r\n(a) REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL (A/47/498 and Add.l) \r\n(b) DRAFT RESOLUTION (A/47/L.13) \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I call on the representative of Honduras, to \r\nintroduce the draft resolution. \r\nMr. CUEVA (Honduras)(interpretation from Spanish): It is an honour \r\nfor me to address representatives at this forty-seventh session of the United \r\nNations General Assembly, with the aim of introducing the draft resolution on \r\nagenda item 21, entitled \"Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization of American States\". I am pleased to announce that the \r\ndelegations of Canada, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago have joined the sponsors \r\nof the draft resolution. \r\nThe inter-American system, the institutional origins of which go back to \r\nthe last century, finds its most eloquent contemporaneous expression in the \r\nOrganization of American States (OAS), as the regional body fully identified \r\nwith the principles and objectives of the United Nations itself. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n6 \r\n(Mr. Cueva, Honduras) \r\nThe Charter of the Organization of American States (OAS) lays down that \r\nnone of its provisions shall be construed as impairing the rights and duties \r\nof its member States under the Charter of the United Nations. For its part. \r\nChapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations refers to the concept of \r\nregional arrangements, making particular reference to the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes, an issue which has long been, and which continues to be, an \r\nintegral part of the inter-American system. \r\nThe complementarity between the two organizations is obvious, and all the \r\nmore so in present circumstances, when regionalism is called on to play an \r\nimportant role in the new world order. \r\nIn his report (A/45/499) of 14 September 1990, the Secretary-General \r\ndescribed United Nations cooperation in the previous two years with the \r\nOrganization of American States. That account is testimony to a great deal of \r\nwork, with practical and highly satisfactory results. \r\nThe report also recognized the effectiveness of the cooperation between \r\nthe two organizations with respect to the procedures established by the \r\nCentral American Presidents within the context of the subregional peace \r\nprocess, which called for cooperation between the two organizations to ensure \r\nbetter implementation of their resolutions. \r\nSimilarly, document A/47/498, the Secretary-General\u0027s report of \r\n5 October 1992, tells us a great deal about consultations and exchange of \r\ninformation between the two organizations and follow-up action on the \r\nimplementation of resolution 45/10 of 25 October 1990. \r\nThe report refers to resolution AG/RES.1126, also on cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Organization of American States, adopted by the \r\nGeneral Assembly of the OAS on 8 June 1991, which noted with satisfaction that \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n7 \r\n(Mr. Cueva. Honduras) \r\nthe Secretaries-General of the two organizations would establish an \r\nappropriate mechanism for the follow-up of coordination between the two \r\nsystems. \r\nIn support of such actions, a new resolution on the subject \r\nAG/RES.1119 was adopted by the General Assembly of the OAS at its \r\ntwenty-second regular session. In that resolution, the OAS General Assembly \r\nrecoinmended that negotiations continue for finalizing and signing an agreement \r\non cooperation between the general secretariats. To that end it was agreed \r\nthat periodic meetings woul 1 be held between the two systems for the purpose \r\nof reviewing and appraising progress on areas of priority or on mutually \r\nagreed issues. \r\nIt is worth noting that the Organization of American States continues to \r\nbe represented in the Support Committee and the Policies and Projects \r\nCommittee and intersectoral meetings of the Special Plan of Economic \r\nCooperation for Central America, established by resolution 42/231. \r\nIn paragraph 9 of resolution 45/10 the General Assembly requested the \r\nSecretary-General to submit to it at its forty-seventh session a report on \r\ncooperation by specialized agencies of the United Nations system with the \r\nOrganization of American States. Responses to that request include the \r\nfollowing. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has continued to \r\npromote active collaboration with OAS at both the headquarters and field \r\nlevels. Examples are to be found in the joint meetings held in March and \r\nJune 1992 in New York to discuss cooperation in the areas of human resources, \r\nwomen in development, science and technology, and environment. Issues such as \r\ndrug abuse and disaster preparedness were also discussed. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n8 \r\n(Mr. Cueva. Honduras) \r\nThrough the Pan American Health Organization, the OAS acts as the \r\nexecuting agency for a project on health management for Central American \r\ncountries, financed by UNDP and the Special Plan of Economic Cooperation. \r\nVarious related projects are also being carried out in the context of the \r\nDevelopment Programme for Displaced Persons, Refugees and Returnees. \r\nPraiseworthy, worthwhile projects are also being carried out jointly with \r\nthe United Nations Environment Programme, the World Food Programme, the \r\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations, the United Nations Educational, Scientific \r\nand Cultural Organization, the International Monetary Fund and another seven \r\ninternational agencies. \r\nWhat I have said relates to the draft resolution that I am introducing, \r\nwhich reflects the consultations between the two organizations to establish \r\nbetter coordination of complementary activities. \r\nIn this regard, I wish to highlight the results in three areas in \r\nparticular! first, an agreement to establish instruments and mechanisms which \r\nwould intensify the exchange of information between the two bodies to ensure \r\nbetter coordination; secondly, the institution of a flexible and expeditious \r\nprocess of identifying suitable programmes, projects and activities; and \r\nthirdly, the establishment of follow-up arrangements. \r\nThe issues chosen for priority action, to be carried out by lead agencies \r\nof both organizations, were: environment; drug abuse control; women and \r\ndevelopment; disaster prevention, mitigation and relief; rural development and \r\nagriculture; and Indian people and development. \r\nWe are therefore absolutely confident that the natural complementarity of \r\nthe two organizations will oe expressed in mechanisms for consultation and \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n9-10 \r\n(Mr. Cueva. Honduras) \r\ncoordination that will gradually be perfected as the number of activities \r\ngrows. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: In accordance with General Assembly resolution \r\n253 (III), of 16 October 1948, I now call upon the Assistant Secretary-General \r\nof the Organization of American States, Mr. Christopher Thomas. \r\nMr. THOMAS (Organization of American States): The Secretary-General \r\nof the Organization of American States (OAS), Ambassador Joao Clemente Baena \r\nScares, has asked me to express to the President his slncerest congratulations \r\non his unanimous election to preside over the General Assembly at its \r\nforty-seventh session. He has also asked me to present his greetings to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. I do so also in my name. \r\nI am very appreciative of this opportunity to address the Assembly on the \r\nquestion of cooperation and coordination between our systems, which have \r\nattained unprecedented heights over the last two years. This cooperation was \r\nlaunched anew and given an enhanced profile when the first OAS-United Nations \r\ngeneral meeting on coordination between the two systems took place here at \r\nUnited Nations Headquarters from 15 to 17 May 1991. This meeting, which was \r\ninaugurated by the Secretaries-General of the OAS and the United Nations \r\nbrought together representatives of the general secretariats and the \r\nspecialized agencies of the inter-American system and the United Nations. The \r\nreport of that meeting contained recommendations for strengthening and \r\ndeepening cooperation and coordination between the OAS and the United \r\nNations. The report (A/47/498) of the Secretary-General of the United Nations \r\nto this General Assembly on cooperation between the United Nations and the OAS \r\nlists the numerous activities of collaboration that have taken place between \r\nagencies of the two systems since that historic meeting. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n11 \r\n(Mr. Thnmas. OAS) \r\nSubsequently, in response to a resolution on cooperation between the OAS \r\nand the United Nations, adopted at the twenty-first regular session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, held in Santiago, Chile, the Secretary-General of the OAS \r\npresented a report to the twenty-second regular session held this year in the \r\nBahamas on that OAS-United Nations general meeting and on other aspects of \r\ncooperation between our two systems. \r\nThe report describes the measures taken and consultations held towards \r\nthe strengthening of cooperation and coordination between the OAS and the \r\nUnited Nations. The policy context for those consultations was essentially \r\nframed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary-General of the OAS, and the \r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Special Political Questions, Regional Cooperation, \r\nDecolonization and Trusteeship of the United Nations. I wish to place on \r\nrecord here my deep appreciation to Under-Secretary-General James Jonah and \r\nhis staff for their collaboration. \r\nThe Office of the Assistant Secretary-General also established close \r\nworking relationships with the former Director-General for Development and \r\nInternational Economic Cooperation and the Assistant Administrator and \r\nRegional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean of the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP). \r\nAs a result of these measures and consultations, and as a follow-up to \r\nthe conclusions and recommendations of the OAS-United Nations meeting, several \r\nspecific collaborative activities have taken place. \r\nWith respect to the specialized agencies, the former Director-General for \r\nDevelopment and International Economic Cooperation, who, under the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations had responsibility for the operational \r\nactivities for development, incorporating organizations and specialized \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n12 \r\n(Mr. Thomas. OAS) \r\nagencies of the United Nations system, agreed to intensify efforts to deepen \r\nand expand collaboration between the specialized agencies of the two systems. \r\nCollaboration with the Assistant Administrator and Regional Director of \r\nthe UNDP for Latin America and the Caribbean has led to an agreement that the \r\nResident Representatives of the UNDP, who, within the United Nations system \r\nfunction as the United Nations coordinators, would establish closer contacts \r\nwith the Director of the Office of the General Secretariat of the OAS in \r\nmember States with a view to developing more functional coordination in their \r\nactivities. This functional cooperation has advanced quite significantly. \r\nI would like to highlight here some areas in which collaboration between \r\nthe OAS and the United Nations has been most effective. In the area of drug \r\nabuse control, collaboration between the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control \r\nCommission (CICAD) of the OAS and the agencies of the United Nations system \r\ninvolved in programmes on drugs has been substantial. At a meeting held \r\nrecently in Vienna between representatives of the Inter-American Drug Abuse \r\nControl Commission and the International Drug Control Programme of the United \r\nNations, a firm basis for long-term cooperation in programme development \r\nbetween both agencies was laid. \r\nThe area of disaster is another in which cooperation between the OAS and \r\nthe United Nations has helped both organizations with the fulfilment of their \r\nmandates in this field. The Permanent Council of the OAS has recently adopted \r\na resolution on natural disaster reduction for sustainable development, in \r\nwhich, inter alia, the Secretary-General of the OAS was requested to reiterate \r\nto the Secretary-General of the United Nations the interest of the OAS to \r\ncollaborate with the United Nations system, as well as specialized regional \r\nand bilateral development assistance agencies in natural hazard management \r\nactivities, to save lives and reduce losses. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n13 \r\n(Mr. Thomas. OAS) \r\nAlso in the area of disaster management, an agreement was signed in March \r\n1992 between the General Secretariat of the OAS and the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme, in which the UNDP provided substantial funds for a \r\nprogramme in disaster management training being executed by the Executive \r\nSecretariat for Economic and Social Affairs of the OAS. \r\nThe recommendations of the OAS-United Nations general meeting were \r\ndirected essentially to collaboration in technical cooperation to countries \r\nthat belong to both systems. Other forms of collaboration between the OAS and \r\nthe United Nations however have taken place to further the objectives of both \r\norganizations. Most notable has been the cooperation between the OAS and the \r\nUnited Nations in bringing democracy to member States by providing assistance \r\nand observation missions for general elections in El Salvador, Nicaragua and \r\nHaiti. \r\nIn the continuing political crisis in Haiti, collaboration between the \r\ntwo organizations was exemplified in the agreement of the General Assembly to \r\nsupport the resolutions of the meetings of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the \r\nOAS on Haiti. Consequently, the Secretary-General of the United Nations \r\nagreed to send officials of the United Nations on the mission of the \r\nSecretary-General of the OAS to Haiti from 18 to 21 August 1992. \r\nWith respect to humanitarian aid to Haiti, the Office of the Assisant \r\nSecretary-General has been collaborating with the Office of Humanitarian \r\nAffairs of the United Nations in the formulation of a comprehensive plan for \r\nhumanitarian aid for Haiti. As I speak to you today, a meeting is now taking \r\nplace in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in which technical personnel of both \r\norganizations are working together for the composition of this plan. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n14 \r\n(Mr. Thomas. OAS) \r\nIt is the hope of all our personnel that the plan will pave the way for \r\nthe consolidation of institutional coordination between our systems in the \r\ntreatment of this tragic human situation. \r\nIn his annual report to the General Assembly, and in his report entitled \r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\", Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali reaffirmed the \r\ncommitment of the United Nations to collaborate with regional organizations \r\nand highlighted the special capability of these organizations in dealing with \r\nthe problems of their region. The increasing demands made on the resources of \r\nboth the OAS and the United Nations make it imperative that collaboration be \r\nintensified. As the oldest regional organization in the hemisphere, the OAS \r\nhas acquired unique experience in assisting the development of countries of \r\nthis hemisphere. In this regard, I draw the attention of this meeting to the \r\noffer by the Chairman of our Permanent Council to the President of the \r\nSecurity Council for increased cooperation in the improvement of collective \r\nmeasures for the prevention and solution of regional conflicts. \r\nI would like to end with the reaffirmation of the OAS General Secretariat \r\nto continue to seek ways to collaborate with the United Nations for the \r\nachievement of the objectives of both organizations. \r\nThe PRESIDENT! The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/47/L.13. \r\nI now call on the representative of the Secretariat. \r\nMr. SUKHODREV (Director of the Office of General Assembly Affairs): \r\nI should like to inform members that, should the General Assembly adopt draft \r\nresolution A/47/L.13 concerning the cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Organization of American States, the Secretary-General does not anticipate \r\nthat any programme budget implications would arise. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n15 \r\nThe PRESIDENT: May I take it that the Assembly adopts draft \r\nresolution A/47/L.13? \r\nDraft resolution A/47/L.13 was adopted (resolution 47/11). \r\nThe PRESIDENT! We have concluded this stage of our consideration of \r\nagenda item 21. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n16 \r\nAGENDA ITEM 29 \r\nCOOPERATION BETWEEN THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE LEAGUE OF ARAB STATES \r\n(a) REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL (A/47/451) \r\n(b) DRAFT RESOLUTION (A/47/L.12) \r\nThe PRESIDENT; I call on the representative of Oman, to introduce \r\nthe draft resolution. \r\nMr. AL-SAMEEN (Oman) (interpretation from Arabic): It is an honour \r\nand a great pleasure for me, as Chairman of the Group of Arab States for the \r\ncurrent month, to speak today, in the context of agenda item 29, \"Cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the League of Arab States\", and introduce the \r\ndraft resolution contained in document A/47/L.12. \r\nOn behalf of the following Arab States, sponsors of the draft \r\nresolution: Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, \r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syrian \r\nArab Repulic, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen I should like to take \r\nthis opportunity to deal with some of the aspects of this draft resolution to \r\nwhich the secretariat of the League as well as the United Nations attaches \r\ngreat importance, because the draft resolution, both in substance and aim, \r\nemphasizes the need to consolidate and develop the existing ties of \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the League of Arab States, in \r\nconsonance with the provisions and goals of Chapter VIII of the United Nations \r\nCharter. \r\nThe draft resolution aims, both in letter and spirit, at promoting and \r\nstrengthening the means, possibilities and mechanisms of coordination at all \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n17 \r\n(Mr. Al-Sameen. Oman) \r\nall levels of cooperation between the two organizations, especially in the \r\ndevelopmental, economic, political and other areas, in line with United \r\nNations resolutions and the resolutions of the summit of Arab States and \r\nMinisters of Foreign Affairs of Arab States. This stems from the importance \r\nattached by the League of Arab States to the discharge of its obligations and \r\nundertakings arising from its membership of the United Nations, within the \r\ncontext of the Organization\u0027s Charter and the rules of International law. \r\nThis constant Arab approach is quite in evidence in the Arab States\u0027 \r\nunwavering efforts to implement United Nations resolutions without \r\nselectivity, in order to strengthen international legality and ensure the \r\ndominance of harmony and cooperation in tomorrow\u0027s world which is now taking \r\nshape with all its prospects, potentials and challenges. We do that in the \r\nstrong belief that all the States of the world should rise to the level of the \r\ncollective responsibility of all towards the collective security of all, the \r\nupholding of justice and the rule of law in an integral fashion, on a basis of \r\ninterdependence, without discrimination or double standards. \r\nIn this connection, operative paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 and the fourth, fifth \r\nand seventh preambular paragraphs, by way of example, are conclusive proof of \r\nthe genuine striving by our States to strengthen the peace process, to rebuild \r\nLebanon, to find a lasting, just and comprehensive solution to the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict and to the question of Palestine, the core of the conflict, \r\nto end occupation and to eliminate all its consequences, so that the right of \r\npeoples to self-determination, freedom and living in peace and security may be \r\nensured. \r\nIn conclusion, I should like to reaffirm that this draft resolution deals \r\nwith all aspects of cooperation, coordination and consultation between the two \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n18-20 \r\n(Mr. Al-Sameen. Oman) \r\nOrganizations, with the aim of achieving the noble goals of the Charters of \r\nboth Organizations and of creating a climate that would lead to the emergence \r\nof a world of cooperation and freedom from conflict in which people may live \r\nin dignity and enjoy independence in societies that are equal, and \r\ninterdependent both at the regional level and throughout the world. \r\nI call upon members to vote in favour of this draft resolution. \r\nThe PRESIDENT; In accordance with General Assembly resolution \r\n477 (V), of 1 November 1950, I now call on the Observer of the League of Arab \r\nStates. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n21 \r\nMr. NASR (League of Arab States) (interpretation from Arabic): I \r\nshould like to join previous speakers in congratulating Mr. Ganev on his \r\nelection to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly, which is \r\nbeing held at a time of far-reaching changes and great challenge for which we \r\nare trying together to find just and peaceful solutions to in line with the \r\nprinciples of the Charter. The election of our President to his lofty post is \r\na token of the international community\u0027s confidence in his abilities and \r\nrecognition of the outstanding position of his country, Bulgaria, amongst the \r\nworld\u0027s nations. \r\nThe League of Arab States, which was created in 1945 - a few months \r\nbefore the creation of the United Nations has common objectives with the \r\nUnited Nations, especially in the area of maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. That is why it was only natural that the two organizations should \r\nhave established ties of fruitful cooperation that have expanded and deepened \r\nthrough the years. This cooperation was crowned by the signing of the 1989 \r\nAgreement of Co-operation between the two organizations on the coordination \r\nand strengthening of their relations and the broadening of their scope in line \r\nwith the common objectives of both their Charters. \r\nThe League of Arab States has been and will continue to be at the \r\nforefront of activity to strengthen the role of the United Nations and to \r\nimplement its resolutions in all spheres, in particular those reaffirming \r\npeoples\u0027 rights to freedom, sovereignty and dignity in the exercise of their \r\ninalienable right to self-determination, especially in our region, where the \r\nPalestinian people must be allowed to enjoy its inalienable right to \r\nself-determination and the establishment of its own independent State, to put \r\nan end to the Israeli occupation of all occupied Arab territories, and to have \r\nA/47/PV. 51 \r\n22 \r\n(Mr. Nasr. League of Arab States) \r\na just and lasting peace. He hope that these resolutions will be implemented \r\nin a fair and non-selective manner so as to ensure for the United Nations the \r\ncredibility it deserves. \r\nWe in the League of Arab States have taken note of the important report \r\nby the Secretary-General of the United Nations, entitled \"An Agenda for \r\nPeace\", in which he gives an analysis of and recommendations on the \r\nstrengthening of the role and effectiveness of the United Nations in the areas \r\nof preventive diplomacy, peace-building and peacemaking. We should like, in \r\nthis regard, to express our appreciation of the ideas contained in that \r\nreport, especially those regarding cooperation and arrangements with regional \r\norganizations pursuant to the provisions of Chapter VIII of the United Nations \r\nCharter. The League of Arab States, for its part, commends such cooperation, \r\nespecially since, in the past, the cold war sometimes prevented us from taking \r\nadvantage of the potential of such cooperation and thus hindered the peaceful \r\nsettlement of some conflicts by the means envisaged in the Charter. \r\nThe League of Arab States has welcomed this new trend and has responded \r\nfavourably to the invitation extended to it and other organizations by the \r\nSecretary-General to participate in a meeting that was convened by the \r\nSecretary-General last February in New York with a view to convincing the \r\nparties involved in the Somalian conflict to agree to a ceasefire. In this \r\nrespect, the League of Arab States wishes to voice its support for the \r\nstatement issued by the President of the Security Council on 16 October 1992, \r\nand joins iu appealing to all parties to the conflict in Somalia to facilitate \r\nthe humanitarian aid mission and to accept the effective presence of the \r\nUnited Nations in Somalia. The League also expresses its support for the \r\ncontinued efforts by the Secretary-General and all relevant bodies, despite \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n23 \r\n(Mr. Nasr. League of \u0026rah States) \r\nthe many difficulties, to find the ways and means capable of putting an end to \r\nbloodshed, of allowing the humanitarian assistance to be provided quickly and \r\nof finding a. peaceful solution to the conflict in Somalia. \r\nThe League of Arab States will continue to provide assistance to the \r\npeople of Somalia and to make tireless efforts to end this tragedy, acting in \r\ncoordination and cooperation with United Nations efforts. On this occasion, I \r\nshould like to add that the League of Arab States is now preparing to send a \r\nsecond medical team to the capital of the northeastern district of Somalia, in \r\naddition to the team already present in the General Hospital of Mogadishu. \r\nHere again, the League is coordinating with the United Nations. \r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the item under consideration, in \r\ndocument A/47/451, cites the areas of cooperation between the League of Arab \r\nStates and the United Nations in the political, economic, social, cultural and \r\nother spheres. I am duty-bound here to express the gratitude of the League \r\nand its specialized agencies to the United Nations Children\u0027s Fund (UNICEF) \r\nand other relevant bodies of the United Nations, as well as to all the \r\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations system, for the efforts being made \r\nto strengthen the ongoing excellent cooperation that has existed between us \r\nsince 1950, when the League of Arab States first participated in a United \r\nNations meeting. \r\nIn this connection, I should like to refer to certain aspects of \r\ncooperation and continued coordination between the League of Arab States and \r\nthe United Nations. In Tunisia, in early November, there will be a high-level \r\nmeeting, in coordination with UNICEF, in which the Secretary-General of the \r\nLeague of Arab States and the Arab ministers responsible for youth will \r\nparticipate with a view to establishing common bases of cooperation between \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n24 \r\n(Mr. Nasr. League of Arab States) \r\nthe League and the United Nations in protecting children in Arab States. We \r\nshould like to express our gratitude for the efforts made by UNICEF in this \r\nsphere. \r\nI should also like to refer to the consultations currently underway \r\nbetween the League of Arab States and the United Nations to prepare for the \r\nmeeting to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the first meeting that was held \r\nin Tunisia in 1983, with the aim of reviewing future cooperation between the \r\ntwo organizations and of assessing objectively and comprehensively the \r\ncooperation that has existed over the past 10 years, as well as establishing a \r\nscheme for cooperation in the years to come. We hope that this meeting will \r\nlead to greater coordination between the two organizations and the \r\ninstitutions involved in the establishment and implementation of joint \r\nprogrammes, and that it will take advantage of Arab experience and Arab skills \r\non the international and the national levels. \r\nI should also like to refer to the agreement between the League of Arab \r\nStates and the Secretariat of the United Nations to hold a joint meeting next \r\nDecember in Geneva, with the participation of many specialized agencies of the \r\ntwo organizations, to establish a common plan for effective cooperation and \r\ncoordination between the two organizations in order to implement certain \r\nrecommendations submitted by the Secretary-General in his report \"An Agenda \r\nfor Peace\", and to serve the common objectives of maintaining international \r\npeace and security and enhancing economic and social development. \r\nThe Middle East has suffered for far too long from the tribulations of \r\nwar, acts of aggression and the occupation of territories by force. For many \r\nyears now, the League of Arab States has reaffirmed time and again, its view \r\nthat we must find a just and lasting solution to the Middle East problem and \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n25 \r\n(Mr. Nasr. League of Arab States) \r\nthe Palestinian question, and has supported efforts to free the Middle East \r\nregion from all weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons. In \r\nthis regard, I should like to reaffirm that the League of Arab States welcomes \r\nall efforts made, through equitable legally binding commitments to apply these \r\nagreements fairly to the entire region. Including Israel, in accordance with \r\nthe same criteria, especially since Israel has so far refused to accede to the \r\nnon-proliferation Treaty. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n26 \r\n(Mr. Nasr. League of Arab States) \r\nThe League of Arab States has repeatedly urged that the Middle East \r\nshould be freed from all weapons of mass destruction, namely chemical, \r\nbiological and nuclear weapons. Last September, the League declared the \r\nreadiness of the Arab States to deal with the Draft Convention on Chemical \r\nWeapons in the measure of Israel\u0027s response to international appeals for it to \r\naccede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to place \r\nits nuclear facilities under the international safeguards regime in accordance \r\nwith Security Council resolution 487 (1981). \r\nThe League has followed the preparatory work for the Conference on Human \r\nRights planned for next year. We should like in this respect to pay tribute \r\nto the efforts aimed at the adoption of a document which would take into \r\nconsideration all fundamental human rights and ensure that they are upheld, \r\nespecially the rights to self-determination, freedom, independence and to a \r\nlife of dignity and security, and to ensure the implementation of all human \r\nrights conventions relative to armed conflicts anywhere in the world. \r\nWe firmly hope that the United Nations, with its Charter and the values \r\nit stands for, will be the cornerstone of the new age, an age which, we hope, \r\nwill have as its highest objectives the primacy of peace, law and justice. \r\nThough the cold war, which lasted for decades, weakened the role of the United \r\nNations, we hope that the old bipolarity will be replaced now by a much \r\nstrengthened role for the United Nations, in order for the Organization to be \r\nable to perform the role envisaged for it in the Charter, and thereby usher in \r\na new era of genuine respect for the interests and the rights of peoples to \r\njustice, peace, freedom, dignity and equality. \r\nIt is in this context, that the League of Arab States views the \r\nimportance of the programme proposed by the Secretary-General in the \"Agenda \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n27 \r\n(Mr. Nasr. League of Af?\u0027? States) \r\nfor Peace\", wherein he emphasized, inter alia, the responsibility of the \r\nUnited Nations and the international community for peacemaking and peace-\r\nkeeping and highlighted the importance of closer cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and international and regional organizations for the \r\nachievement of common objectives. \r\nIn conclusion, the League of Arab States reiterates its support for the \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and wishes the United \r\nNations every success in its search for solutions to the problems and crises \r\nthat it faces up to in order for all the world\u0027s peoples to enjoy a life of \r\ndignity, freedom, development and prosperity. We reaffirm our determination \r\nto do our utmost to ensure closer cooperation with the United Nations with the \r\naim of building a better world. \r\nThe PRESIDENT! The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/47/L.12. \r\nI call on the representative of the Secretariat. \r\nMr. SUKHODREV (Director of the Office of General Assembly Affairs): \r\nI should like to inform members that, should the General Assembly adopt draft \r\nresolution A/47/L.12 concerning the cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe League of Arab States, the Secretary-General does not anticipate that any \r\nprogramme budget implications would arise. \r\nThe PRESIDENT; We shall now begin the voting process. A recorded \r\nvote has been requested. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n28 \r\nA recorded vote was taken. \r\nIn favour! Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, \r\nArgentina, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, \r\nBarbados, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nBotswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, \r\nCanada, Cape Verde, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, \r\nCuba, Cyprus, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Djibouti, Ecuador, \r\nEgypt, Equatorial Guinea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Finland, \r\nFrance, Gabon, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, Guinea, \r\nGuinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, \r\nIndia, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Ireland, \r\nItaly, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Lao People\u0027s \r\nDemocratic Republic, Latvia, Lebanon, Libyan Arab \r\nJamahiriya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, \r\nMadagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mexico, \r\nMicronesia (Federated States of), Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, \r\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, \r\nPanama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, \r\nQatar, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, Sao \r\nTome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, \r\nSingapore, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Swaziland, \r\nSweden, Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, Togo, Trinidad and \r\nTobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania, Uruguay, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Yemen \r\nAgainst! Israel, United States of America \r\nAbstaining: San Marino \r\nDraft resolution A/47/L.12 was adopted by 119 votes to 2. with 1 \r\nabstention (resolution 47/12)* \r\nThe PRESIDENT! Before calling on those representatives wishing to \r\nexplain their vote after the voting, may I remind delegations that, in \r\naccordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations of vote are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats. \r\nMr. CLIFF (United Kingdom): I have the honour to speak on behalf of \r\nthe European Community and its member States. \r\n* Subsequently, the delegations of Azerbaijan, Lesotho, Mauritania, \r\nMauritius, Mongolia, Mozambique and Nigeria advised the Secretariat that they \r\nhad intended to vote in favour. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n29 \r\n(Mr. Cliff. Pnî fiji Kingdom) \r\nWhile we have voted in favour of the resolution on cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the League of Arab States just adopted, we wish to make \r\na few general comments. \r\nWe fully support cooperation between the United Nations and regional \r\norganizations, including those holding observer status. The benefits have \r\nbeen highlighted by the Secretary-General in his report \"An Agenda for \r\nPeace\". We are happy to join in expressions of support and encouragement for \r\nthe further development of such cooperation within the framework of the United \r\nNations Charter. \r\nHowever, we would prefer that resolutions of this kind deal with the \r\nquestion of cooperation in terms which avoid introducing contentious \r\nelements. In particular, with regard to operative paragraph 5 of \r\nresolution 47/12, which has just been adopted, we wish to draw attention to \r\nthe need to avoid prejudicing the role of the Secretary-General and to the \r\nfact that the Twelve have not supported all the resolutions referred to in \r\nthat paragraph. \r\nWith regard to operative paragraph 12 of the resolution, we would like to \r\nstate again that its contents should not serve as a precedent for the future. \r\nThe United Nations should be free to make use of the best and most economical \r\nexpertise available to it. \r\nMs. ESTEFAN (United States of America): I regret that the United \r\nStates was obliged, as it has done in the past several years, to vote against \r\nthis resolution. \r\nThe United States does seek to support the work of the Arab League, and \r\ndoes support increased cooperation between the United Nations and the League \r\nof Arab States. The Arab League played a positive role in the Gulf crisis. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n30 \r\n(Ms. Estefan. United States) \r\nand my Government cooperated with members of the League to that end. The Arab \r\nLeague\u0027s tripartite High Committee was instrumental in helping settle the \r\nconflict in Lebanon, and my Government cooperated with members of the League \r\nto that end as well. \r\nHowever, as we stated in each of the preceding several years, we cannot \r\nsupport a resolution which includes language and references inconsistent with \r\nfundamental policies of the United States Government and which we have \r\nconsistently opposed. This resolution asks the Secretary-General, in \r\noperative paragraph 5, to help implement United Nations resolutions that the \r\nUnited States has opposed. In the tenth preambular paragraph, the resolution \r\nincludes reference not to United Nations-Arab cooperation but to a statement \r\nof the 1980 Arab Summit which contains language and conclusions which were \r\nunacceptable not only to the United States but to many other members of this \r\nAssembly as well. We regret that the sponsors of this resolution have chosen \r\nto include these references. \r\nA/47/PV. 51 \r\n31 \r\n(Ms. Estefan. Unit-o-̂  states) \r\nWe welcome the new sixth preambular paragraph, which welcomes the peace \r\nprocess begun at Madrid, but must register a reservation. To single out and \r\nto characterize the core of the Middle East conflict as the question of \r\nPalestine is to simplify an exceedingly complex conflict involving Israel and \r\nthe Arab States, as well as the Palestinians. We would have preferred \r\ndifferent language in this paragraph, just as we would have preferred to join \r\nin the consensus on the draft resolution with other members of the Assembly. \r\nMr. TAYLOR (Canada): Itself a member of regional organizations, \r\nCanada knows the value of effective cooperation between regional organizations \r\nand the United Nations system. Accordingly, we support cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the League of Arab States and voted in favour of the \r\ndraft resolution. We have reviewed the Secretary-General\u0027s report (A/47/451) \r\nand note that it gives examples of constructive cooperation between the two \r\nsystems. He want to see such beneficial cooperation continued. \r\nNevertheless, we feel compelled to point out that Canada did not vote for \r\nsome of the General Assembly resolutions referred to in paragraph 5. The \r\nreference to those controversial issues is in part balanced by the new \r\nparagraph making positive reference to the current Middle East peace process, \r\nbut we would like the cooperation between the United Nations and the League of \r\nArab States, as well as the text of the resolution, to reflect the more \r\npositive situation that the peace process has engendered. \r\nMr. FEDOTOV (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): The \r\ndelegation of the Russian Federation is in favour of combining the efforts of \r\nregional bodies and organizations with those of the United Nations, especially \r\nin the areas of ensuring security, conflict prevention and settlement and \r\nresponse to environmental and humanitarian emergencies. Initial experience in \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n32 \r\n(Mr. Fedotov. Russian Federation) \r\ninteraction between regional organizations and the United Nations is being \r\ngradually accumulated in Europe, Africa and a number of other regions. \r\nTherefore we supported the draft resolution, which is designed to promote \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the League of Arab States as a \r\nregional organization in the sense of Chapter VIII of the Charter. \r\nAt the same time, the Russian delegation cannot agree with the inclusion \r\nin the resolution of outmoded language pertaining to the substance of the \r\nMiddle East settlement which does not take into account the new facts of life \r\nassociated with the emerging Middle East peace process. In particular, we \r\nobject to the provisions which in fact amount to an attempt to distort the \r\nagreed mandate of the Madrid conference by including words to the effect that \r\nthe core of a Middle East settlement is the question of Palestine, whereas it \r\nis merely one of the main issues being considered as part of the Middle East \r\nnegotiation process. \r\nAccordingly, if this language had been put to a separate vote, the \r\ndelegation of Russia would not have been able to support it. \r\nMr. MALIK (Iraq) (interpretation from Arabic): My delegation has \r\nvoted in favour of draft resolution A/47/L.12 on the promotion of cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the League of Arab States, just adopted by the \r\nAssembly. This is a resolution we have consistently supported over the years. \r\nHowever, in view of Iraq\u0027s special stance with regard to the so-called \r\nMiddle East peace process mentioned in the sixth preambular paragraph, Iraq \r\nwishes to make known its reservations with regard to that paragraph, which we \r\nwould like to see reflected in the record. \r\nWe would have preferred that such an issue should not have been injected \r\ninto the resolution so that we would not have been compelled to voice our \r\nreservations. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n33 \r\nMr. WIDE (Sweden): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the five \r\nNordic countries, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. The Nordic \r\ncountries voted in favour of the resolution just adopted by the General \r\nAssembly with the understanding that elements with political implications, in \r\nparticular in paragraph 5, are not relevant to the issue and obviously cannot \r\nprejudice the position of the Nordic countries on the substantive matter \r\nreferred to therein. \r\nMr. HAMADA (Japan): The delegation of Japan is well aware of the \r\nextremely valuable benefits to be derived from cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the various organizations with observer status. Japan thus \r\nwelcomes and firmly supports the cooperation of the United Nations with the \r\nLeague of Arab States. Consequently, Japan voted in favour of draft \r\nresolution A/47/L.12. In doing so, Japan would like to place on record, \r\nhowever, its position concerning paragraph 5 of the draft resolution, which \r\nincludes a reference to some United Nations resolutions which Japan did not \r\nsupport. \r\nJapan also wishes to draw attention to the need for efforts to limit the \r\ncost of such cooperation between the United Nations and the various \r\norganizations with observer status, in view of the current financial \r\nconstraints. \r\nMs. BIRD (Australia); Australia has been a consistently strong \r\nsupporter of instruments of regional cooperation and of cooperation between \r\nsuch bodies and the United Nations. It is for this reason that Australia \r\nvoted in favour of the resolution just adopted. We do, however, have \r\ndifficulties with paragraph 5, which refers to United Nations resolutions, \r\nsome of which Australia has not supported. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n34-35 \r\n(Ms. Bird. Australia) \r\nConcerning paragraph 12, while understanding the sentiment expressed, we \r\nconsider that the United Nations should continue to be mindful of the need for \r\nmerit, efficiency and economy in the employment of staff. This principle \r\napplies in all resolutions where considerations of this kind are raised. \r\nAs a general comment, my delegation also hopes that the resolutions \r\nadopted in the Assembly on Middle East items generally will reflect the more \r\npositive situation arising from the Middle East peace process. \r\nMr. HASSAN (Sudan) (interpretation from Arabic); Sudan has voted in \r\nfavour of draft resolution A/47/L.12 on cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the League of Arab States in line with the unified stance by the League of \r\nArab States with regard to the draft resolution in general. However, my \r\ndelegation does have reservations with regard to the sixth preambular \r\nparagraph of the draft resolution which reads: \r\n\"Welcoming the peace process concerning the Middle East, which \r\ncommenced in the convening of the Madrid conference in 1991, with a view \r\nto achieving a comprehensive and just settlement of the Middle East \r\nconflict, the core of which is the question of Palestine\". \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n36 \r\n(Mr. Hassan. Sudan) \r\nMy delegation\u0027s reservations with regard to that paragraph stem from the \r\nfact that it was injected into this draft resolution in an inappropriate \r\nfashion. The United Nations plays no role whatsoever in the peace talks now \r\nunder way between certain Arab countries and Israel, a process that began with \r\nthe convening of the Madrid Conference in 1991. \r\nThe United Nations has been excluded deliberately from involvement in \r\nthat process, starting with the Madrid Conference and the talks that \r\nfollowed. This exclusion of the United Nations was insisted upon by certain \r\nparties to those talks for reasons we do not consider to be convincing. The \r\nfact is involvement by the United Nations in the talks was considered to be \r\ndetrimental to the designs of those parties. \r\nThat is why we can find no justification whatsoever for the injection of \r\nthe paragraph in this draft resolution, which has to do with cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the League of Arab States. \r\nMy delegation is of the view that the best framework for the just, \r\ncomprehensive and durable settlement of the Middle East conflict and the core \r\nissue of that conflict, the question of Palestine is the convening of an \r\ninternational peace conference under the auspices and control of the United \r\nNations. He feel that any attempt to settle this conflict outside the context \r\nof the United Nations can never lead to a comprehensive, just and durable \r\nsettlement. \r\nNotwithstanding our positive vote on the draft resolution, we wish the \r\nrecord to reflect our. reservations with regard to this particular paragraph. \r\nMr. JACOB (Israel): My delegation voted against the draft \r\nresolution just adopted for reasons that have been spelled out repeatedly in \r\nour previous statements on this issue. As those reasons have already been put \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Jacob. Israel) \r\non record, we shall not repeat them here. Given the bilateral and \r\nmultilateral negotiations currently under way between Israel and its Arab \r\nneighbours, all of which are members of the League of Arab States, we feel \r\nthat restraint at this juncture is more appropriate. \r\nHe should like, however, to refer to the tenth preambular paragraph, \r\nwhich makes reference to the Arab Summit Conference held at Amman in \r\nNovember 1980. The Amman Conference went so far as to criticize \r\nSecurity Council resolution 242 (1967) and the Camp David Accords, which serve \r\nas the basis for the current peace process. It is regrettable that such a \r\nreference is included in the resolution. \r\nHe should like also to refer to paragraph 5, which calls for the \r\nimplementation of \"United Nations resolutions relating to the question of \r\nPalestine and the situation in the Middle East\". Israel has consistently \r\nvoted against these resolutions because they have never constituted any \r\ngenuine basis for a negotiated and peaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli \r\nconflict. Israel has always advocated the principle of direct negotiations \r\nwithout preconditions as the only way to promote peace in the region, and \r\nindeed the current peace process is based on this principle. \r\nFurthermore, the sixth preambular paragraph, while welcoming the current \r\nMiddle East peace process, includes language that is at variance with the \r\nprinciples set out in the sponsors\u0027 letter of invitation to Madrid of \r\n18 October 1991. In addition, on the one hand the resolution includes \r\nreferences to the Amman Conference and to the aforementioned resolutions on \r\nthe question of Palestine and the situation in the Middle East, which stand in \r\nopposition to any genuine notion of peace. On the other hand the resolution \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n38 \r\n(Mr. Jacob. Israel) \r\nrefers to the Madrid Conference, which initiated the current peace process. \r\nThus the resolution clearly contradicts itself. \r\nWe should like to call upon the members of the Arab League to help \r\npromote the Middle East peace process. Israel, for its part, is committed to \r\ndoing its utmost to bring this process to a fruitful conclusion. \r\nMr. TAKHT-RAVANCHI (Islamic Republic of Iran): The Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran voted in favour of the resolution just adopted. However, my \r\ndelegation would like to express its reservations on the sixth preambular \r\nparagraph, in line with our previous position on the subject. \r\nMr. ADENIJI (Nigeria): My delegation supports all efforts aimed at \r\nstrengthening cooperation between the United Nations and various regional \r\norganizations. We believe that the United Nations has a responsibility in the \r\npresent context of the evolution of international relations to encourage \r\nregional organizations, especially where they take initiatives for the \r\nstrengthening of regional peace, regional security and regional development. \r\nThat is why my delegation regrets its unavoidable absence when the \r\ndecision on this draft resolution was taken. If my delegation had been \r\npresent, we would certainly have voted in favour of it. \r\nThe PRESIDENT; He have concluded this stage of our consideration of \r\nagenda item 29. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n39-40 \r\nPROGRAMME OF HORK \r\nThe PRESIDENT: Representatives will recall that on 5 and 14 October \r\nthe President of the General Assembly announced our tentative programme of \r\nwork of the General Assembly for the months of October and November and the \r\nfirst week of December. \r\nThe President has requested me to inform members of the following \r\nadditions and changes to our tentative programme of work. \r\nOn Tuesday, 10 November, in the morning, the Assembly will consider \r\nagenda item 27, \"Cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization \r\nof African Unity\", after hearing an address by the President of the Republic \r\nof Zambia. \r\nOn Friday, 20 November, the Assembly will consider agenda item 37, \r\n\"Strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian emergency assistance of the \r\nUnited Nations\". \r\nAGENDA ITEM 24 \r\nCOOPERATION BETHEEN THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE LATIN AMERICAN ECONOMIC SYSTEM \r\n(a) REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL (A/47/463) \r\n(b) DRAFT RESOLUTION (A/47/L.7) \r\nThe PRESIDENT! The report of the Secretary-General has been issued \r\nas document A/47/463. \r\nIn this connection the Assembly has before it a draft resolution issued \r\nas document A/47/L.7. I call on the representative of Peru to introduce the \r\ndraft resolution. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n41 \r\nMr. LUNA (Peru) (interpretation from Spanish): I am pleased to \r\nintroduce the draft resolution \"Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nLatin American Economic System\", in document A/47/L.7, sponsored by 27 States \r\nmembers of the Latin American Economic System (SELA). \r\nThe main objective of the draft resolution is to strengthen and broaden \r\ncooperation between the United Nations system and the Latin American Economic \r\nSystem. This cooperation meets the need to bring to a variety of new problems \r\nsolutions in keeping with the global vision of the United Nations and the \r\nspecific contributions of regional groups. In this way the draft resolution \r\nseeks to contribute to the concrete application of the objectives of the \r\nUnited Nations in our region. \r\nThe emerging international order puts into a new perspective the role of \r\nregional mechanisms of consultation and teamwork in the economic and social \r\nfields. \r\nTwo simultaneous and apparently contradictory trends make it even more \r\nessential to define properly the linkage between the world Organization and \r\nregional bodies. On the one hand, the globalization process of the \r\ninternational economy is becoming irreversible, while on the other, the \r\nestablishment of regional economic groupings is gaining impetus. One of the \r\ngreatest challenges of the immediate future is that of developing the positive \r\nfeatures of both trends while avoiding their pitfalls and making them work for \r\nthe benefit of international society as a whole. \r\nAlong these lines, regional mechanisms like SELA are the link par \r\nexcellence between the global efforts of the international community and the \r\npractical application of measures stemming therefrom. In the case of Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, the global issues now on the international \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Luna. Peru) \r\nagenda, which call for a new approach based on cooperation and understanding, \r\nhave in SELA an ideal vehicle for progress towards international teamwork. \r\nIn this context, it is SELA\u0027s historical imperative to facilitate and \r\nstimulate, with an integrated, up-to-date vision, its States members\u0027 efforts \r\nfor political, social and economic transformation in order to foster solid, \r\nprosperous economies, expand trade and promote investment. In this way Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean will be able to become a region of confluence, \r\nrenewal and stimulation of global economic and financial trends, in accordance \r\nwith the visionary spirit of SELA\u0027s charter. These circumstances of global \r\ninterdependence highlight in particular the need to continue strengthening the \r\nenergizing links of cooperation between the United Nations and the Latin \r\nAmerican Economic System. \r\nIn the preambular part of the draft resolution before the Assembly, \r\nspecial reference is made to the many different activities carried out by the \r\nLatin American Economic System in concert with various organs of the United \r\nNations system and also to SELA\u0027s implementation of priority programmes for \r\nthe economic development of the countries of the region. \r\nThe operative part of the draft resolution takes note with satisfaction \r\nof the report of the Secretary-General and urges the Economic Commission for \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean and the United Nations Development Programme \r\nto broaden and deepen their coordination and support activities with SELA. It \r\nalso urges the specialized agencies and other organizations and programmes of \r\nthe United Nations system to intensify their cooperation with the activities \r\nof this regional body. It requests the Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations and the Permanent Secretary of SELA to assess jointly the \r\nimplementation of the recently signed Agreement on cooperation and to report \r\nthereon at the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n43 \r\n(Mr. Luna. Peru) \r\nSince this draft resolution is free of controversial elements and since \r\nit also embodies the hopes of the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean \r\nfor the broadening and strengthening of cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand SELA, the delegation of Peru, on behalf of the sponsors, comprising all \r\nthe States members of SELA, hopes that the General Assembly will adopt it \r\nwithout a vote. \r\nMr. CAMPOS (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish): I should like \r\nfirst to express the Chilean delegation\u0027s satisfaction that the agenda of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-seventh session once again takes up the \r\nimportant item of cooperation between the United Nations system and regional \r\nbodies. This morning we shall consider United Nations cooperation with the \r\nOrganization of American States (OAS), the Latin American Economic system and \r\norganizations of other regional groups. \r\nAs we have already stated on various occasions and at various forums, my \r\ncountry considers it extremely important to strengthen the existing bodies, \r\nwhich have invaluable experience, trained technical staff, reservoirs of \r\ninformation and a distinguished history. At the same time, we have expressed \r\nthe need to establish linkages between regional organizations and the United \r\nNations system with the aim of using resources efficiently and thus making the \r\ninternational bodies more effective. \r\nWith these considerations in mind, Chile has joined the sponsors of the \r\ndraft resolution introduced by the representative of Honduras on cooperation \r\nbetween the Unite\u0027d Nations and the Organization of American States. By the \r\nsame token, we welcome the report submitted by the Secretary-General in \r\ndocument A/47/498, which contains a detailed account of the activities carried \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n44-45 \r\n(Mr. Campos. Chile) \r\nout by various agencies of the United Nations system and the Organization of \r\nAmerican States. \r\nIn this connection my delegation would like to highlight the fact that at \r\nthe twenty-second session of the General Assembly of the OAS, held in May of \r\nthis year in the Bahamas, a similar decision was adopted that placed on record \r\nthe satisfaction of members at the efforts made by both organizations and \r\ncalled for the Secretary-General of our regional organization to continue to \r\nstrengthen cooperation with the United Nations. \r\nWe are delighted to see that these very same elements are embodied in the \r\ndraft resolution now before the world Organization. We feel that cooperation \r\nand coordination between the United Nations and the OAS must be stepped up \r\nwith regard to preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping and, most \r\nespecially, strengthening democratic systems and full respect for human \r\nrights, all of which are matters to which my Government gives the highest \r\npriority. \r\nWith regard to cooperation with the Latin American Economic System, my \r\ndelegation voiced its support last year for the terms of the Agreement signed \r\nbetween the United Nations and SELA. As we indicated then, that commitment \r\nwould make it possible to open new channels for expanding the economic and \r\nsocial development prograiranes of which our region is in such need and to \r\nstrengthen other initiatives that would commit both organizations to working \r\ntogether. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n46 \r\n(Mr. Campos. Chile) \r\nIn accordance with the provisions of resolution 46/12 the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has submitted a comprehensive report on cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Latin American Economic System, as well as on other matters in \r\nthat resolution. \r\nMy delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-General for his report in \r\ndocument A/47/463, which sets out in detail the cooperative programmes already \r\ncarried out and also notes the progress made in building ties between the \r\nregional and the world organizations. We believe that the report is fully in \r\nkeeping with the requirements of requests in the resolution adopted at the \r\nforty-sixth session of the General Assembly, held in 1991. \r\nWe note with satisfaction that programmes of cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and SELA have expanded in recent times. In keeping with \r\ntradition, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) \r\nhas indeed played a key role in attaining this goal. \r\nWe urge other bodies throughout the United Nations system to pursue and \r\nintensify their support for and cooperation with SELA activities, particularly \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), with a view to strengthening \r\nand broadening support for those programmes the Permanent Secretary of the \r\nLatin American Economic System is carrying out. \r\nWhen we spoke at the last session of the General Assembly we also made \r\nreference to a programme being carried out in the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nregion involving the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development \r\n(UNCTAD), ECLAC and SELA with regard to the Uruguay Round, which is close to \r\ncompletion. \r\nOn that occasion, and given the successful experience gained in that \r\nprogramme, my delegation wishes to support the new programme called \r\nA/47/PV. 51 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Campos. Chile) \r\n\"LATINTRADE\", mentioned in paragraph 43 of the report (A/47/463). This \r\nprogramme will be sponsored by UNCTAD, ECLAC and SELA, and will have the \r\nbacking of UNDP as well as the support, in the light of experience gained, of \r\nthe Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Ibero-American Association \r\nof Chambers of Commerce representing the private sector. \r\nHence my country, Chile, has decided to join the sponsors of draft \r\nresolution A/47/L.7, just introduced by the representative of Peru. We hope \r\nthat the General Assembly will adopt it by consensus. \r\nMr. VILLEGAS (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish): The delegation \r\nof Mexico is pleased to participate in the discussion on this important item \r\nfor the Latin American and Caribbean region and this Organization. Given the \r\nshaky state of the global economy Latin America is once again confronted with \r\nmajor challenges. The upward trend our region had recorded over the past \r\nbiennium is beginning to slow down, calling into question whether it can be \r\nsustained and, thus, the direction of the enormous efforts exerted in the task. \r\nThis early erosion of gains made is in large measure the result of \r\nexogenous factors. It does not appear that the international economic \r\nenvironment is at all favourable to the development of the Latin American \r\neconomy. After a decade of adversity the countries of the region have devised \r\nshort-term policies of adjustment and of economic reform that any developed \r\ncountry would have had difficulty adopting. The imperative of joining a \r\ndynamic and interdependent world system gave rise to encouraging prospects \r\namongst us. \r\nIn this context we have placed special emphasis on policies aimed at open \r\ntrade, in the belief that this sector has a key role to play in promoting \r\ngrowth. Among the numerous risks facing our regional economy, we should like \r\nto highlight those posed by this sector. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n48 \r\n(Mr. Villoqas, Maxico) \r\nFor more than six years the parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs \r\nand Trade (GATT) have been working resolutely to work out a consolidated trade \r\nsystem involving the exchanging not only of goods but also of services, a \r\nsystem which would be beneficial to all parties. This exercise is now facing \r\nits greatest challenge. The parties concerned will have to make an earnest \r\neffort to break the deadlock and move forward in the negotiations, which are \r\nthe key to the economic future not only of Latin America and the Caribbean but \r\nalso of the entire world. \r\nOver the 17 years since its inception the Latin American Economic System \r\n(SELA) has been playing a significant catalytic role in the processes of \r\nregional integration. Its function to provide analysis and to promote joint \r\nefforts has contributed to bringing all the countries of this development \r\nregion closer together. Through its forums of consultation and coordination \r\nit has facilitated the adoption of consensus positions on issues of great \r\nsignificance to our countries. It has also made it possible to identify \r\nproblems of concern to our societies and to find solutions to them. \r\nWe are pleased to note that the Secretary-General\u0027s report on this item \r\nindicates that relations between the Organization and SELA have expanded and \r\ndeepened in the past 12 months. We welcome the fact that a growing n\\imber of \r\nagencies in the system are becoming involved in these activities. \r\nWe wish in particular to highlight the fruitful and intensive work which \r\nover this period has been carried out jointly by SELA and the Economic \r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC). In this context the \r\npriority given to social issues in the region through specific actions such \r\nas the establishment of networks of data banks in this regard is \r\ncontributing not only to consciousness-raising on these issues but also \r\nproviding a basis for the adoption of appropriate policies and measures. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n49-50 \r\n(Mr. Villeoas. Mexico) \r\nThis fruitful work is being done in cooperation with a variety of \r\nagencies, such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which play \r\na leading role in technical cooperation in our region. Currently a project \r\ncovering activities of great interest to the countries in our region is being \r\nanalysed together with UNDP, with a view to its inclusion in the fifth \r\nprogramming cycle. \r\nWe should also like to highlight the communication and cooperation that \r\nhas been established with bodies throughout the United Nations system dealing \r\nwith matters of the greatest importance to us, such as the United Nations \r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the General Agreement on Tariffs \r\nand Trade (GATT) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization \r\n(UNIDO). \r\nWith regard to population matters, positive efforts have also been made \r\nto become actively involved in the preparations for the forthcoming World \r\nConference on Population and Development, which we very much welcome. \r\nWe believe that cooperation between the Latin American Economic System \r\nand this Organization is of particular relevance, given the period of \r\ntransition being experienced in Latin America and the Caribbean. It is \r\nimportant that such cooperation be expanded and consolidated, for it is \r\ndirectly contributing not only to the efforts at integration in the region but \r\nalso to our programme to consolidate and spur development and growth in our \r\ncountries. \r\nThat is the purpose of the draft resolution now before the Assembly, of \r\nwhich my delegation is a sponsor. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n51 \r\nMr. HERNANDEZ (Dominican Republic) (interpretation from Spanish); \r\nIn 1975, 25 Latin American and Caribbean countries met in Panama City to set \r\nup a permanent body to coordinate the region\u0027s positions on various issues \r\nvis-a-vis countries outside the region and international organizations. Those \r\ncountries now 26 also decided that the body would organize cooperation \r\nbetween the countries of the region. \r\nThe Latin American Economic System (SELA) was established as the first \r\ngenuinely Latin American and Caribbean body, in response to the need of the \r\nentire region to realize its potential by defining its own identity. It \r\nfilled the gap in the structure of relations within Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean, there being no authentic regional body to enable the countries of \r\nthe region to discuss their positions and take collective decisions in defence \r\nof their own interests. \r\nIt is true that Latin America and the Caribbean form a very heterogeneous \r\nregion, that national conditions differ, that there are marked size \r\ndifferences between countries, and that economic structures and the volume of \r\ngoods and services produced vary greatly. It is also true that countries in \r\nthe region are more or less vulnerable depending on their geographic \r\nposition. However, in their external relations, both economic and political, \r\nthere are more elements uniting them than dividing them, as is seen in SELA, \r\nwhose members take advantage of those unifying factors to work in concert to \r\nsolve the problems that beset them. \r\nThe sensitivity and efficiency of an international body may be defined \r\nby, inter alia, the promptness and speed with which an item, problem or point \r\nof special interest finds its way onto its agenda and programme of work. \r\nTopics such as economic security, economic aggression, and problems of \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. Hernandez. Dominican Republic) \r\nexternal debt, as well as new items, such as transparency in international \r\ndata and international trade in services, can be dealt with rapidly, and as \r\nhas been demonstrated repeatedly, when they are most topical and in need of \r\nurgent action. SELA is very sensitive and efficient, and is also thoroughly \r\ndemocratic and fair. \r\nTherefore, SELA has given tangible form to our region\u0027s determination to \r\ncreate new realities and put new life into relations within the region. A \r\nconstant feature of its multilateral actions has been the maintenance of its \r\nfounding principles equality, sovereignty, solidarity and independence and \r\nnon-interference in internal affairs, on the basis of full respect for the \r\neconomic, social and political systems freely chosen by peoples and States \r\nthemselves which gave birth to the organization and are its raison d\u0027etre. \r\nThere is today, as never before, confidence that Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean have made progress along the path of development, but they have \r\ndiscovered that there is still a great gap between reality and their \r\nlegitimate expectations and unfulfilled potential. We have had confidence in \r\nSELA since its foundation. The system is trying to realize those legitimate \r\nexpectations and the unfulfilled regional potential. Given all that, and the \r\nneed for close cooperation with the United Nations in accordance with what the \r\nSecretary-General says in his \"Agenda for Peace\" about cooperation with \r\nregional arrangements, our delegation not only supports, but is a sponsor of, \r\ndraft resolution A/47/L.7, confident that cooperation between the two \r\norganizations will not only continue, but increase day by day. \r\nMrs. ROCKEFELLER (United States of America); Last April President \r\nBush told the Forum of the Americas, a group of 400 business leaders from \r\nNorth and South America, that the people of the Americas were well on the way \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n53 \r\n(Mrs. Rockefeller. Un^t-pd States) \r\n\"to creating something mankind has never seen: a hemishere wholly free \r\nand democratic, with prosperity flowing from open trade.\" \r\nThe United States, as a regional member of the Economic Commission for \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), has an interest in supporting \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Latin American Economic System \r\n(SELA). We believe that more and more this cooperation will contribute to \r\nwhat is a \"quiet revolution\" sweeping the economy of the region. The economic \r\nprogress that is pulling Latin America out of a decade of debt, capital flight \r\nand stagnation indeed amounts to a quiet, unpublicized revolution. This has \r\nbeen the result of brave political leadership and economic wisdom in many \r\nLatin capitals. \r\nPresident Bush\u0027s Enterprise for the Americas Initiative was launched to \r\nhelp support this self-generated commitment to market-oriented reforms \r\nundertaken by the leaders of Latin America. In trade, the Initiative is \r\nmoving towards the creation of a liberalized trading system, free of barriers, \r\nin the western hemisphere. In investment, it encourages equity investment and \r\nthe return of flight capital, which will be the forms of financing of the \r\nfuture not loans that create more debt. With regard to foreign debt, it has \r\nalready seen the reduction of $263 million in food-aid debt, among other \r\nthings. The Enterprise for the Americas Initiative is » firm element in \r\neconomic relations within the region, and we look forward to the continued \r\ninvolvement of ECLAC, SELA and all other parties in its potentials and \r\nsuccesses. \r\nThis \"quiet revolution\" that I mentioned is moving the countries of Latin \r\nAmerica towards market-driven growth and potential prosperity. Latin America \r\nis emerging from the economic crisis of the 1980s with increased prospects for \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n54-55 \r\n(Mrs. Rockefeller. United States) \r\nsustained economic growth and stable democratic societies in which broader \r\nopportunities for participation are available throughout the population. \r\nThe region\u0027s real gross domestic product grew by an estimated \r\n2.8 per cent in 1991, and it is projected to rise by 3.5 per cent in 1992. \r\nInflation has fallen by two thirds, while official reserves have doubled. \r\nThese figures rank the region very high among the regions forming the global \r\neconomy. \r\nThe United States desires increased ECLAC cooperation with other regional \r\neconomic associations, such as SELA, in pursuit of continued market-driven \r\ngrowth in the region. Latin America is the fastest growing regional market \r\nfor United States exports; in 1991 such exports were more than double those of \r\n1986. In turn, Latin America has become very attractive to United States \r\ndirect investment, which doubled between 1986 and 1990. Latin countries are \r\nincreasingly entering the capital markets for new financing, and from 1989 to \r\n1992 they witnessed a tenfold increase in new private capital flows from \r\n$4 billion to some $40 billior.. \r\nThe draft resolution before us urges continued support by ECLAC and \r\nUnited Nations specialized agencies for cooperation with SELA, ECLAC will \r\ntake on new importance, for two very strong reasons: regional economic growth \r\nis vibrant, and the Secretary-General\u0027s reform will likely direct more \r\nfunctions to the regional economic commissions than ever before. ECLAC will \r\nidentify and assist more and more opportunities for economic growth. It must \r\ntherefore work in collaboration with other regional organizations, such as \r\nSELA, in the efficient pursuit of this goal. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n56 \r\n(Mrs. Rockefenoi\". United \r\nStates of America) \r\nMy delegation was pleased to participate in last April\u0027s ECLAC consensus \r\nresolution entitled \"Restructuring and Revitalization of the United Nations in \r\nthe Economic and Social Fields: Role and Functions of the Economic Commission \r\nfor Latin America and the Caribbean\". It endorsed the need for ongoing \r\nrestructuring and revitalization of the United Nations system in the economic \r\nand social fields, and made concrete commitments to that effect. It was \r\nundertaken at the behest of General Assembly resolution 46/235. That \r\nresolution called for ECLAC, among the other regional commissions, to be \r\nenabled fully to play its role under the authority of the General Assembly and \r\nthe Economic and Social Council, and for the strengthening of ECLAC\u0027s \r\neffectiveness. \r\nThe United States delegation believes that the direction of ECLAC\u0027s \r\nreform resolution confirms the importance of economic liberalization and \r\npolicy reform. Cooperation between ECLAC and SELA should derive every benefit \r\nfrom that resolution, together with the relevant section of the report of the \r\n24th session of the Commission and the document entitled \"Restructuring and \r\nrevitalization of the United Nations in the Economic and Social Fields: Role \r\nand Functions of ECLAC\". This direction promises a useful, collaborative \r\napproach to cooperation on continuing economic liberalization and policy \r\nreform among the countries in the region. \r\nWith increased cooperation between ECLAC and SELA, my delegation is \r\nconfident that the liberalizing countries of Latin America will prosper in \r\ntheir new direction towards democracy-building, free enterprise development, \r\nand the rule of law. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n57 \r\nThe PRESIDENT; The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/47/L.7. May I take it that the Assembly adopts draft resolution \r\nA/47/L.7? \r\nDraft resolution A/47/L.7 was adopted (resolution 47/13). \r\nThe PRESIDENT; In accordance with General Assembly resolution 35/3, \r\nof 13 October 1980, I now call on the Observer for the Latin American Economic \r\nSystem. \r\nMr. DE ROJAS (Latin American Economic System (SELA)) (interpretation \r\nfrom Spanish): On behalf of the Permanent Secretariat of the Latin American \r\nEconomic System (SELA) I should like to express my profound appreciation to \r\nthe States members of this Assembly for the resolution that has just been \r\nadopted and in particular to the delegations of Peru and of the other Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean countries that sponsored it, and those delegations that \r\nsupported it. \r\nAs stated in the resolution, we are convinced that it will help in \r\nbroadening and deepening coordination and mutual support activities between \r\nthe United Nations and SELA, which the report of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/47/463) clearly shows are already numerous. In fact, since the signing of \r\nthe Agreement on cooperation between the two organizations in October last \r\nyear and the adoption of resolution 46/12, reaffirmed today, we have seen a \r\nvigorous growth in cooperative activities and joint endeavours, not only \r\nthrough the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) \r\nand various departments of the Secretariat in New York but also with other \r\norganizations and specialized agencies within the system, such as the United \r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development, the United Nations Educational, \r\nScientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations Industrial \r\nDevelopment Organization, the World Intellectual Property Organization, the \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr. De Rojasr SELA) \r\nWorld Health Organization, the United Nations Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations, the International Fund for Agricultural \r\nDevelopment, the Latin American Institute for Economic and Social Planning and \r\nthe United Nations University. \r\nWith regard to the United Nations Development Programme, which is singled \r\nout for special reference in the resolution, we are happy to state that next \r\nweek the definitive text of the new regional support programme for SELA will \r\nbe delivered, fitting in with the fifth programming cycle. The document has \r\nalready been the subject of intensive consultations between the Latin American \r\nBureau of the programme and the SELA Permanent Secretariat. Hence, we hope \r\nthat with the diligent support of the Governments in the region it will very \r\nsoon be adopted and implemented. \r\nThe Latin American Council, the highest body of our organization, had its \r\neighteenth ordinary annual meeting just a few weeks ago, and adopted a series \r\nof decisions in which it was shown that the Latin American and Caribbean \r\ncountries continue to hope that SELA will continue its work in the areas of \r\ndebt and financing, external trade, regional integration, environment and \r\ndevelopment, industrialization and technology, and social development, which \r\nare also priority items on the Assembly\u0027s agenda. \r\nThe delegations attending the meeting of the Latin American Council also \r\nshowed the great interest attached by their Governments in the restructuring \r\nprocess of the United Nations in the economic and social spheres, which has \r\nbeen a focus of attention at the present session of the General Assembly and \r\nrequested the Permanent Secretariat to follow closely this process in close \r\ncontact with the delegations in New York. \r\nA/47/PV.51 \r\n59 \r\n(Mr. De Roias. SELA) \r\nThe Council also decided to recommend the Secretariat to continue \r\nproviding the support and technical assistance required by the member states \r\nof the system and to work in cooperation with them in drawing up a strategy \r\nfor action in the medium term in all international economic forums. \r\nThe Permanent Secretary of SELA, Mr. Salvador Arriola, will be in New \r\nYork next week in order to discuss with the Secretary-General ways and means \r\nof implementing the resolution just adopted, and also to meet the \r\nAdministrator and other officials of UNDP in connection with the new regional \r\nprogramme. He will make use of his visit to hold consultations with the \r\ndelegations of the States of the region and other countries with an interest \r\nin SELA\u0027s work in the main subjects that we are working on in the economic and \r\nsocial field, many of which, as I stated, are at present under consideration \r\nby the General Assembly, and also to discuss the support activities the \r\nPermanent Secretariat will be continuing to offer to those delegations that \r\nrequest them and have an interest in our work. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: We have concluded this stage of our consideration of \r\nagenda item 24. \r\nThe meeting was adjourned at 12.40 p.m. \r\n"
