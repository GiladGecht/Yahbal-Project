Mr. GANEV (Bulgaria) \r\nReport of the United Nations Conference on Environment and \r\nDevelopment [79] \r\n(a) Report of the Conference \r\n(b) Report of the Secretary-General \r\nThis record contains the original text of speeches delivered in English \r\nand interpretations of speeches in the other languages. The final text will \r\nbe printed in the Official Records of the General Assembly. \r\nCorrections should be submitted to original speeches only. They should \r\nbe sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned, within \r\none week, to the Chief, Official Records Editing Section, Office of Conference \r\nServices, room DC2-750, 2 United Nations Plaza, and incorporated in a copy of \r\nthe record. \r\n92-61712 2509V (E) \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n2 \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.45 a.m. \r\nAGENDA ITEM 79 \r\nREPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT \r\n(a) REPORT OF THE CONFERENCE (A/CONF.151/26, vols.I-IV and vol.Il/Corr.1) \r\n(b) REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL (A/47/598 and Add.l); \r\nThe PRESIDENT: As members will recall, at its 3rd plenary meeting, \r\nthe General Assembly decided that the debate on agenda item 79 would be held \r\ndirectly in plenary meeting, on the understanding that action on the item \r\nwould be taken in the Second Committee. \r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the institutional arrangements to \r\nfollow-up on the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development has \r\nbeen circulated in document A/47/598 and Add.l. The report of the Conference \r\nhas been issued as document A/CONF.151/26, volumes I to IV. \r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that I have received a letter dated \r\n30 October 1992 from the Permanent Representative of Denmark on behalf of the \r\nWestern European and other States requesting that the Assembly hear in plenary \r\nmeeting statements by the Observers of the Holy See and Switzerland during the \r\ndebate on agenda item 79. \r\nMembers will recall that, in accordance with the established practice of \r\nthe General Assembly, observer non-Member States may normally make statements \r\nonly in the Main Committees. However, following consultations, and taking \r\ninto account the importance attached to the issue under discussion, it is \r\nproposed that the General Assembly take a decision to hear the Observers of \r\nthe Holy See and Switzerland in the course of the debate in plenary meeting on \r\nthis agenda item. I take it that there is no objection to this proposal. \r\nIt was so decided. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n3-5 \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I should like to propose that the list of speakers \r\nin the debate on this item be closed this afternoon at 5 p.m. If I hear no \r\nobjection, it will be so decided. \r\nIt was so decided. \r\nThe PRESIDENT; I therefore request those representatives wishing to \r\nparticipate in the debate to inscribe their names as soon as possible. \r\nI call on the Secretary-General of the United Nations. \r\nThe SECRETARY-GENERAL; I have looked forward to the opening of this \r\ndebate. It is an occasion to share with you my thinking on the United Nations \r\nas an agent of development. The report of the Conference on Environment and \r\nDevelopment (A/CONF.151/26, Vol.I-IV), ranging so widely over economic and \r\nsocial questions, gives me my platform. I shall also touch upon matters \r\nrelating directly to the follow-up of that Conference, which is now in your \r\nhands. \r\nIn my first year of office, I have had the privilege of participating in \r\nthree important United Nations events dealing with global development! first, \r\nthe Cartagena Conference on Trade and Development; secondly, the Rio \r\nConference on Environment and Development; and, thirdly, the high-level \r\nsegment of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). I have also taken part \r\nin the work of regional commissions in Asia and in Europe. \r\nMy evaluation of these events - recently summed up in my annual report on \r\nthe work of the Organization (A/47/1) has reinforced my conviction of the \r\npotential of this instutition. The Rio Earth Summit was an example of the \r\ncapacity of the United Nations to mobilize political, public and instutitional \r\nenergies around key issues of global development. Only the United Nations \r\ncould have achieved it; its potential is unique. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n6 \r\n(The Secretary-General) \r\nThe challenge after Rio is to maintain the momentum of commitment to \r\nsustainable development, to transform it into policies and practice, and to \r\ngive it effective and coordinated institutional support. \r\nMy conviction is sustained by my sense of the opportunity for \r\nconstructive action created by the end of the cold war. We can now work for \r\nan era of North-South cooperation that is not distorted by ideological and \r\npolitical East-West tensions. Peace and prosperity are indivisible, but they \r\nare threatened by gross inequalities within and between nations. Balanced \r\nplanetary development is not only an enlightened aim; it is \u003ca foundation for \r\nthe enduring progress of all societies. Development cooperation must be \r\ncarried forward on this basis, in parallel with technical and financial \r\nsupport to help the former planned economies in their transition. \r\nThis new era brings new intellectual and political challenges. While the \r\ncommand economy is discredited, the market economy has yet to achieve its \r\npotential. The market is an instrument of efficiency and of material growth. \r\nBut development is more than growth; it is the improvement of human well-\r\nbeing. Economic growth is the mainspring of development, but its thrust must \r\nbe guided by equity, justice and social and ecological responsibility if \r\ndevelopment is to endure. This, in my view, is the meaning behind sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\nThis is the ground for the new contest of ideas. Many guestions are open \r\nin democratic political discourse. Even in richer market economies, social \r\ntensions and environmental degradation pose serious problems of governance. \r\nIn countries everywhere, the policies to deal simultaneously with \r\nunemployment, inflation, debt and trade imbalances have proved elusive. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n7 \r\n(The Secretary-General) \r\nIn the years of bipolar confrontation, it was easy to fall back on \r\nstereotypes. These are now irrelevant. Democracy and the market economy must \r\nnot become mere slogans. The new convergence on these forms brings with it an \r\nobligation to engage in a sober analysis of successes and failures in \r\norienting market forces in different national conditions towards \r\ndemocratically determined goals. It requires a renewed commitment to support \r\ndeveloping countries in their efforts to build democratic, market-oriented \r\nsocieties. It requires a fresh look at the international environment in which \r\nsuch societies can flourish. \r\nThis debate on the content of democratic governance and development, \r\nnational and international, sets the context for a redefinition of the role of \r\nthe United Nations in these spheres. This Organization must be a major source \r\nof ideas in this debate. It must be faithful to its mission while adapting to \r\nevolving needs. Its perspective must be global, seeking out the common \r\ninterests of the world community. It must be centred on people, their rights \r\nand their talents. It must highlight the unspoken concerns of the poor and \r\nthe needs of future generations. \r\nFrom such a perspective, the United Nations must bring the major issues \r\nto the Member States\u0027 attention. In its areas of competence, it must help \r\nthem to come to grips with the problems of these times. Member States, for \r\ntheir part, must work to keep alive the consensus that is unfolding from the \r\nspecial session of the General Assembly, through Cartagena and Rio, to the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. This consensus is a source of guidance and \r\ncommitment to policy creation and institutional renewal. \r\nI am convinced that this Organization can meet the twin challenges of \r\nsubstance and structure. The intellectual and managerial task is vast. But \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n8 \r\n(The Secretary-General) \r\nwe are guided by the genius of the Charter, so rich, so flexible, and yet so \r\nstraightforward in its provisions for international economic and social \r\ncooperation. \r\nThis Organization must put its development objectives on a par with its \r\npolitical and security commitments. Intergovernmental bodies must promote \r\npolicy coherence and programme coordination. And different types of programme \r\nactivities, particularly analytical and operational activities, must support \r\nand reinforce each other. \r\nIntergovernmental reform and Secretariat reform are two sides of the same \r\ncoin. Member States have their share of responsibility in this joint \r\nventure. It is for them to adopt consistent positions and take decisions on \r\nthe reform of intergovernmental structures, and for me only to urge \r\nexpeditious action and to advise on its content. \r\nI set great store on the continuing reform of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. I want to see it live up to its central responsibilities under the \r\nCharter. The Council, functioning intersessionally as needed, should address \r\ndevelopment issues that affect international security and bring them to the \r\nattention of the Security Council. Integrated oversight is needed, through \r\nthe Economic and Social Council, of the governance and priorities of all \r\nfunding programmes for development operations, including the amount and \r\npredictability of their financing. The Commission on Sustainable Development \r\nshould bolster the Council\u0027s efforts to promote coherence and coordination. \r\nWhile the Council must respond to a diversity of interests among Member \r\nStates, the logic of priority-setting must lead to thinning the undergrowth of \r\nsubsidiary bodies. There are now some 40 bodies reporting directly to the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. Many have their own subsidiaries, bringing the \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n9-10 \r\n(The Secretary-General) \r\ntotal number of expert and intergovernmental committees in the economic and \r\nsocial field close to 200. While there were, I am sure, valid technical, \r\nsubstantive reasons for their creation, how many Governments can truly cope \r\nwith such an extensive machinery? What is the limit beyond which such a \r\nmachinery becomes a burden, rather than a source of useful inputs for national \r\nGovernments and international policy-making? I trust that, in the context of \r\nthe current debate on the reform of the intergovernmental machinery, there \r\nwill be the necessary political will to address these questions squarely. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n11 \r\n(The Secretary-General) \r\nThese are matters for decision by Member States. But a contribution can \r\nbe made by improvements in the functioning of the Secretariat. A more \r\neffective Secretariat can provide better service to Member States and to the \r\nintergovernmental machinery. It can also stimulate and facilitate the reform \r\nof that machinery. The process of streamlining intergovernmental structures \r\nshould not hold up Secretariat reform. A revamped Secretariat can better \r\nserve the existing machinery while awaiting the new. \r\nThe Secretariat should not be sxibdivided by its legislative history or by \r\nthe geography of the intergovernmental bodies it serves. All staff, whether \r\nin a department, a programme or a fund, must be unified under the authority of \r\nthe Secretary-General. We must motivate, mobilize and integrate all \r\nanalytical and operational capacities of the Secretariat at Headquarters and \r\nin the field. Such steps will enable the Secretariat to exercise clearer \r\nleadership in the United Nations system and provide stronger support for the \r\nneeds of Member States. \r\nIn reviewing options for further reform of the Secretariat in the \r\neconomic, social and environmental areas, I have personally sought advice from \r\na panel of independent advisers. The stature of the panelists leaves me in no \r\ndoubt as to the value of their advice, which I have been taking into account \r\nas their work proceeds. I look forward to the results of their further work \r\nin the coming weeks. \r\nThe thoughts on further restructuring that I share with the Assembly \r\ntoday are advanced on my own responsibility. Restructuring and streamlining \r\nthe Secretariat were among my main preoccupations on taking office. They will \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n12 \r\n(The Secretary-General) \r\nremain one of my main commitments throughout my tenure as Secretary-General. \r\nWhile reform has no natural stopping point, it should be concerted and \r\nsystematic. \r\nOne of my key objectives is to build a unity of purpose for the economic, \r\nsocial and environmental sectors of the Organization. These have grown \r\nincreasingly fragmented and compartmentalized. I will also take steps to \r\nstrengthen linkages between those sectors and the political and humanitarian \r\nsectors of the Organization. The complex field operations in which the United \r\nNations is increasingly engaged should practice an integrated approach to \r\npeace and development. \r\nIn earlier restructuring efforts, as in the current one, a central \r\nconcern has been to ensure adequate support for the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\nmanagerial and coordination responsibilities in the development sphere. \r\nDifferent models have been advanced, each with strengths and weaknesses. My \r\nintention is to address the issue from its roots. \r\nA prerequisite is that the Secretary-General devote the necessary time \r\nand personal attention to these responsibilities. I am committed to doing so \r\nand to obtaining the support I need in this task from all quarters of the \r\nSecretariat. \r\nMy managerial strategy will be to define clearly those tasks for \r\ndevelopment and cooperation that should be carried out by the Organization \r\nitself within the system of the specialized agencies and institutions. In the \r\nfirst instance I am moving to determine those functions that should be carried \r\nout here at Headquarters. I shall then proceed to decisions on a more \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n13 \r\n(The Secretary-General) \r\nrational distribution of responsibilities between Headquarters and United \r\nNations centres in Geneva, Nairobi and Vienna. The relocation of activities \r\nshould provide a clearer purpose for each of the United Nations programmes, as \r\nwell as sharpening the substantive focus of each of the centres. \r\nClear lines of responsibility in a simpler structure, together with steps \r\nto eliminate duplication and overlapping, can go a long way towards solving \r\nthe problem of coordination. This can be my main contribution. \r\nBearing in mind these considerations and the experience gained from the \r\nfirst phase of restructuring, I see three clusters of economic, social and \r\nenvironmental functions for Headquarters in New York. While there are \r\ndifferent options for translating these sets of functions into institutional \r\nstructures, this clustering necessarily entails a significant decentralization \r\nof activities away from Headquarters. At the same time, there may be a need \r\nfor some redeployment to Headquarters. \r\nThe first cluster includes coordination and substantive support for the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and the Commission on Sustainable Development. \r\nThe rationale for linking these two responsibilities derives from the broad \r\ncoverage of Agenda 21 and the Commission\u0027s terms of reference. Support for \r\nthe Economic and Social Council will relate to its functions of policy \r\ncoordination and governance of operational activities. Support for the \r\nCommission and the follow-up to the United Nations Conference on Environment \r\nand Development would be distinctly organized within this cluster. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n14-15 \r\n(The Secretary-General) \r\nThe second cluster comprises data collection, methodology, policy \r\nanalysis and the articulation of development perspectives. The Secretariat \r\nmust be recognized as a centre of excellence for the analysis of development \r\ntrends in all parts of the world, and of their international interactions. \r\nThe proper elaboration of statistics and data the essential foundation for \r\neconomic and social analysis - is one of the riches of the United Nations. \r\nThis collective asset must be preserved, strengthened and adapted to new \r\nneeds. He must ensure wide access and dissemination, especially to countries \r\nwith insufficient national capacities. \r\nThe third cluster involves technical cooperation. This should be carried \r\nout from Headquarters only where there is a clear comparative advantage in \r\nrelation to the rest of the United Nations and the system as a whole. It \r\nshould focus on programmes that cut across regions and sectors, and on the \r\nleast developed countries and those requiring special assistance programmes. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n16 \r\n(The Secretary-General) \r\nThe central structures should also include a capacity to stimulate \r\nexchanges with sources of ideas and action proposals outside the United \r\nNations and the governmental sphere. Intellectual communities, citizens\u0027 \r\nassociations and the corporate sector all have valuable contributions to \r\nmake. This was demonstrated by UNCED. The United Nations must be open to the \r\ndemocratic forces of civil society, without losing its intergovernmental \r\ncharacter. \r\nStriking the right balance between Headquarters and other centres, on the \r\none hand, and regional structures, on the other, is a key question. I believe \r\nthat the balance has shifted too much to the centre. It is time to breathe \r\nnew life into the regional commissions. They must become truly representative \r\nof the Organization, while moving more clearly into the range of central \r\noversight. \r\nThe strength of the regional commissions lies in their multidisciplinary \r\nreach and in their ability to mediate between global and national activities. \r\nThey too must operate within a coherent institutional strategy. They too need \r\nrestructuring and streamlining to fit into this strategy and to respond to the \r\nchanging needs of their regions. \r\nWe need a fresh look at the distribution of analytical and operational \r\ncapacities between global and regional structures. Some redeployment to the \r\nlatter is likely. For example, most technical advisory services could be more \r\neffectively delivered from the regions. Such decentralization would imply \r\ngreater delegation of authority, as well as measures to ensure accountability. \r\nTurning to the national level, I am determined to improve United Nations \r\nperformance in the field. Teamwork is the key. We must move quickly to a \r\nsingle United Nations presence that would encompass programmes under my direct \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n17 \r\n(The Secretary-General) \r\nauthority, including the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the \r\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Children\u0027s Fund \r\n(UNICEF), the United Nations Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) and the World Food \r\nProgramme (WFP). This combined operation would carry out an integrated \r\nstrategy in each country where the Organization operates. It would be headed \r\nby a United Nations Representative, appointed by the Secretary-General, who \r\nwould also be the Resident Coordinator for the United Nations system. This \r\nwould strengthen the function of the Resident Coordinator, in line with the \r\nexpressed request of Member States. \r\nWe have made a start with unified representation in six countries of the \r\nCommonwealth of Independent States, the former members of the Soviet Union. \r\nHe have made progress with our colleagues in the Administrative Committee on \r\nCo-ordination (ACC) in an approach to common country strategies. These \r\nmeasures of integration need to be tested in practice and adapted in the light \r\nof experience. It is my hope that their success will make the case for the \r\nwhole system to speak with one voice in the capitals of Member States. \r\nThese ideas on the clustering of Headquarters functions, decentralization \r\nand the organization of operational and field activities will need to be \r\nrefined and translated into specific institutional arrangements. The further \r\nadvice of the panel of experts on these questions will be of great value to my \r\ndecisions. \r\nGreater clarity and coherence will enhance the capacity of the \r\nOrganization to promote coordination within the United Nations system. I \r\nstress again the importance I attach to the ACC and to my relationship, as its \r\nChairman, with the executive heads of all of the specialized agencies and \r\ninstitutions of the system. I shall continue to give that role the time and \r\nattention it deserves. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n18 \r\n(The Secretary-General) \r\nThe Committee has initiated a comprehensive analysis of its role and \r\nfunctioning, as well as a radical streamlining of its subsidiary machinery. \r\nThis should enable the Committee to meet with new effectiveness the challenge \r\nof the times. Harnessing the capacity of the system to advance Agenda 21 is \r\nsuch a challenge. \r\nThe concept of sustainable development, consecrated in Rio, can become an \r\ninstrument of integration, giving coherence to diverse programme activities. \r\nAgenda 21 itself offers a framework for coordinating the development \r\nactivities of the whole United Nations system and for mobilizing organizations \r\noutside it. \r\nLet me now turn to my report on the follow-up to UNCED. It contains \r\nrecommendations on the functioning of the Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and on the High-Level Advisory Body on Sustainable Development, as \r\nwell as on related arrangements for inter-agency coordination and secretariat \r\nsupport. \r\nIn preparing this report, I followed closely the relevant recommendations \r\nin Agenda 21 and sought to remain faithful to the spirit of the agreement \r\nreached in Rio. I have already referred to the secretariat support \r\narrangements. I shall direct my remarks now to other aspects of my report. \r\nIt seems clear that the Governments assembled at Rio intended to place \r\nthe Commission at the heart of arrangements to achieve sustainable development \r\nand keep alive the spirit of the Earth Summit. The mobilization of political \r\nwill, intellectual leadership and partnerships for sustainable development \r\nwill provide the necessary momentum. Let me address these three elements \r\nbriefly. \r\nIn mobilizing political will, the Commission starts with a significant \r\nadvantage. The results of UNCED have received the explicit endorsement of \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n19-20 \r\n(The Secretary-General) \r\npolitical leaders from all parts of the world. The Conference has produced \r\nInternationally accepted guidelines for the economic, social and ecological \r\nfuture of our planet. This is a good beginning; we must ensure continuing \r\npolitical involvement in its follow-up. The Commission must be organized so \r\nthat ministers will want to participate in it. One of their continuing tasks \r\nwill be to define and refine the strategies and policies needed to foster \r\nsustainable development. They will also monitor and promote the financial \r\nflows, both bilateral and multilateral, needed to implement Agenda 21 and to \r\nassist developing countries in their pursuit of sustainable development. \r\nHigh-level participation in the Commission is vital for success. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n21 \r\n(The Secretary-General) \r\nIn exercising intellectual leadership, the Commission will build upon the \r\nconceptual breakthroughs embodied in Agenda 21. The transition to \r\nsustainability involves core issues of consumption patterns, poverty and \r\ndemographic pressures. The Commission\u0027s analysis should focus on these three \r\nelements as a basis for organizing the assessment of the future evolution of \r\nAgenda 21. \r\nSupport for the intellectual leadership of the Commission will come from \r\nthe eminent persons participating in the High-level Advisory Board on \r\nsustainable development. Their number must be kept relatively small 15 or \r\nso, in my view to maximize opportunities for effective interaction and \r\ndialogue. They will bring wisdom and insights from the sciences, business and \r\nother non-governmental sectors. I propose to concentrate available expertise \r\nin a single advisory body on environment and development, bearing in mind that \r\nthe present membership of the Committee for Development Planning expires at \r\nthe end of this year. \r\nUNCED generated unprecedented public interest in many countries. This \r\nled to increased public awareness of the issues at stake. It stimulated a \r\nmyriad of activities within countries and communities, notably by advocacy \r\ngroups and educators. The UNCED process also stimulated important scientific \r\nand technical work by research institutions and professional organizations, \r\nand it engaged the involvement of representatives of the business community. \r\nAll these non-governmental networks fed back into the Conference and enhanced \r\nits political and intellectual impact. \r\nThe work of the Commission must continue to attract the partnership of \r\nthese non-governmental constituencies. This, in turn, will serve to propagate \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n22 \r\n(The Secretary-General) \r\nthe results of the Commission\u0027s work in the public dialogue on sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\nUNCED involved a high degree of cooperation between all agencies and \r\nprogrammes of the United Nations system. A high-level, policy-oriented \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development will provide similar incentives for \r\nsystem-wide cooperation, especially if funding aspects are dealt with \r\neffectively. \r\nThe Administrative Committee on Coordination (ACC) established last week \r\nan Inter-Agency Conunittee on Sustainable Development. Its membership for an \r\ninitial two-year period will include the core group of the preceding ACC task \r\nforce: the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the \r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the \r\nHorld Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank, the World Meteorological \r\nOrganization (WMO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the \r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). To these I have added, with the \r\nagreement of the ACC, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the \r\nVienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The Committee will be \r\nopen to other members of the ACC interested in specific issues on its agenda. \r\nThis Committee will be the principal source of assistance for the ACC in \r\ndischarging its new responsibilities in the follow-up to Rio. Under my \r\nchairmanship, this will be a standing item on the ACC agenda. \r\nI assure members that my ACC colleagues are as committed as I am to \r\nmeeting fully the responsibilities that UNCED has placed upon us. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\nAllow me to summarize the principal items in this ambitious reform, which \r\nis vital for the Organization. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n23 \r\n(The Secretary-General) \r\nThe United Nations, as I have said, has a unique role to play, if it is \r\nable to meet the challenge of change on the dual level of ideas and \r\ninstitutions, and if Member States agree to accept their responsibilities, \r\nbecause the reform of the Secretariat and of the intergovernmental bodies \r\ndepends on the agreement of Member States. Here I attribute tremendous \r\nimportance to the reform of the Economic and Social Council and the \r\nrationalization of its many subsidiary bodies. The Secretary-General must \r\ntherefore devote more time and personal attention to the economic and social \r\nsectors. I promise to do so and, secondly, to simplify, eliminate overlapping \r\nof duties and rationalize the distribution of responsibilities. \r\nI recommend that the Commission on Sustainable Development have a limited \r\nnumber of members, if it is to function properly. We need a kind of Security \r\nCouncil on development issues. \r\nThe future Inter-Agency Committee and the Coinmission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment need to cooperate closely, and they must have the same \r\nsecretariat. The High-level Advisory Board on sustainable development must be \r\nextremely restricted in size; its members should come from Member States, \r\nrepresenting not only Governments, but also scientific institutions and \r\nnon-governmental organizations, and, finally, the business world, which will \r\nhave to deal with environmental issues. \r\nI wish to conclude by repeating that all people - men, women and society \r\nas a whole - aspire to development and peace and to the enjoyment of \r\nfundamental rights and democracy. These fundamental values appear in the \r\nvarious cultural visions of human well-being: indeed, they make up the four \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n24-25 \r\n(The Secretarv-General) \r\npillars of the Charter of the United Nations. They are closely \r\ninterdependent, and progress in one promotes progress in the others. \r\nUnfortunately, in many cases these values regress to the point where human \r\ndignity and even human life are threatened. As Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations, I firmly intend to defend these values on all fronts and to \r\nmake the Secretariat an effective instrument serving not only the purposes and \r\nprinciples of our Organization, but also the people that make up the United \r\nNations. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n26 \r\nThe PRESIDENT! I now call on the Rapporteur-General of the United \r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development. \r\nMr. BRAHIMI (Algeria), Rapporteur-General of the United Nations \r\nConference on Environment and Development (UNCED) (interpretation from \r\nArabic): The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development \r\n(UNCED), which was held in Rio from 3 to 14 June, may be considered, as \r\ndescribed by its Secretary-General, Mr. Maurice Strong, at the very beginning \r\nof the preparatory process, as the Conference of the century. \r\nThis is due, first of all, to the record participation in the Conference \r\nand the high level of representation that was unprecedented in the history of \r\nmultilateral diplomacy. \r\nIt is also due to the issues discussed and the nature of the areas of \r\ninvestigation, which sought to reconcile Man with his environment and to meet \r\nthe present and future reguirements of development. \r\nIt is due also to the scope of the Conference and to its impact, which is \r\nlikely to affect the trends of multilateral cooperation in the twenty-first \r\ncentury. As a matter of fact, there has never been an intergovernmental \r\nmeeting that matched the success of the Rio Conference in mobilizing so much \r\nenergy, attracting so much interest and raising so many hopes. \r\nThis must have been due to the unprecedented gravity of the threats \r\narising from the many and varied breaches committed against the fundamental \r\necological balances. \r\nConsequently, there has never been such a clear manifestation of the \r\ninternational will of all cations, rich and poor, large and small, to work \r\ntogether in facing up to and dealing with all the phenomena that lead to the \r\ndeterioration of the environment. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n27 \r\n(Mr. Brahimi. \r\nRapporteur-General. UNCED) \r\nThe United Nations has never been in a better position to discharge the \r\ntasks entrusted to it by the founding fathers, pursuant to the pertinent \r\nprovisions of its constituent Charter. \r\nA great deal of the credit for the success of this undertaking lies with \r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who, with his vision and \r\npolitical courage, did inject decisive momentum into the work of the \r\nConference itself and into the Preparatory Committee. This has been clearly \r\nevidenced once again by his highly enlightening and instructive introductory \r\nstatement here today as we begin our discussion. He has shown us the path we \r\nshould take toward the completion of the enterprise started at \r\nRio de Janeiro. Our warmest thanks go to him. \r\nThe other indefatigable architect of the successful Earth Summit meeting \r\nis unquestionably its Secretary-General, Mr. Maurice Strong. We wish to pay \r\nhim a warm and well-deserved tribute, and to extend to him, once again, our \r\ngratitude. \r\nThe success of the Rio Conference would not have been possible without \r\nthe outstanding contribution made by the Chairman of the Main Committee, \r\nAmbassador Tommy Koh. Thanks to his own brilliance and his unstinting and \r\nunremitting efforts over a cwo-year period, together with the Chairmen of the \r\nthree Working Groups and the various coordinators, he ensured the successful \r\ncompletion of the Preparatory Committee\u0027s work. \r\nLikewise, the excellent facilities provided by the authorities of the \r\nFederal Republic of Brazil, as well as the highly professional services of \r\nMr. Miles Stoby and his excellent team, greatly contributed to the success of \r\nthe Rio de Janeiro Conference. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n28 \r\n(Mr. Brahimi. \r\nRapporteur-General. UNCEDl \r\nThe same must be said of the contribution particularly significant \r\nbecause of the unprecedented level of participation in the Conference - of all \r\nthe unofficial sectors, especially the community of non-governmental \r\norganizations (NGOs). That contribution paved the way for an expansion of \r\nmutually advantageous cooperation, whose outlines are in the documents that \r\nembodied the results of the Conference. \r\nIn concluding its work, the Earth Summit meeting adopted, first, the \r\nRio de Janeiro Declaration on Environment and Development, the premises of a \r\nreal Earth Charter; secondly, an ambitious programme of action, entitled \r\nAgenda 21, covering no fewer than 115 areas of activity; and thirdly, a \r\nstatement of non-legally binding, but authoritative principles, on the \r\nmanagement, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests. \r\nThe Earth Summit meeting also offered the opportunity, in parallel with \r\nits regular work, for the holding of signing ceremonies for the Convention on \r\nClimate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity. Each of them has \r\nbeen signed, to date, by 153 countries. \r\nThe Rio de Janeiro Declaration, which articulated the relationship \r\nbetween the environment and development, served in a timely fashion to \r\ncomplement and build upon the principles contained in the Stockholm \r\nDeclaration on the Human Environment and to prepare the ground for what the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations and Mr. Maurice Strong have both \r\ndescribed as an Earth Charter, which might be adopted on the occasion of the \r\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. \r\nA/47/PV,52 \r\n29-30 \r\n(Mr. Brahimi. \r\nRapporteur-General. UNCED) \r\nThe programme of action, entitled Agenda 21, sets out to provide the \r\nbasis for a new global partnership for sustainable development in an \r\nincreasingly interdependent world. \r\nHaving been established on a solid foundation of common interests, mutual \r\nneeds and the shared but differentiated responsibilities of States, that \r\nprogramme embodies a new concept of North-South cooperation, capable, we \r\nbelieve, of giving birth to the sort of global partnership to which we all \r\naspire after. \r\nHowever, if such a global partnership is to materialize, the Agenda 21 \r\nprogrammes of action must be translated into practical measures on the ground \r\nwith the aim of promoting intersectoral cooperation amongst all the key actor \r\nsocieties and governments. This is where Agenda 21 is unique. Its uniqueness \r\nstems from the fact that it parts company with traditional patterns of \r\nmultilateral cooperation, in so far as it is aimed at governments, agencies, \r\norganizations, programmes of the United Nations system, other governmental and \r\nnon-governmental organizations, groups, associations and to public opinion at \r\nlarge, all of which are called upon to participate fully and effectively, at \r\nall levels, in its implementation. The programmes in Agenda 21 are all \r\ncentred on a set of issues within a coordinated strategy aimed at bringing \r\nabout a global transition towards sustainable development. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n31 \r\n(Mr. Brahimi. \r\nRapporteur-General. UNCEDl \r\nIn adopting Agenda 21, the governments of the industrialized countries \r\nhave reaffirmed, among other things, their commitment to achieving the target \r\nof 0.7 per cent of their gross national products allocated to official \r\ndevelopment assistance. Furthermore, they stressed the need to find lasting \r\nsolutions to the debt problem, especially in the case of low- and \r\nmiddle-income countries. In adopting Agenda 21, the Rio Conference also \r\nrecommended that the structure and the procedures of the Global Environment \r\nFund should be modified so as to expand its scope and so as to give developing \r\ncountries a more important role in the decision-making process. \r\nAt Rio, it was also decided that governments should promote and fund \r\naccess for developing countries to environmentally sound technologies, \r\nincluding on a concessionary and preferential basis. \r\nIn the domain of desertification, a very important decision was taken \r\nwhereby the present session of the General Assembly would be asked to set up \r\nan intergovernmental negotiating committee to draft an international \r\nconvention to combat desertification, particularly in Africa. \r\nFurthermore, the Rio Conference recommended the convening of some \r\nimportant international conferences, particularly a conference on sustainable \r\ndevelopment for small, island developing States, a conference on the \r\nintegrated development of coastal regions and a conference on marine resources. \r\nChapter 38 of Agenda 21 calls for the setting up of a high-level \r\ncommission for sustainable development, to be responsible for follow-up and \r\ncoordination of the decisions of the United Nations Conference on Environment \r\nand Development. Moreover, the statement of non-legally-binding but \r\nauthoritative principles for a world consensus on the management, conservation \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n32 \r\n(Mr. Brahimi, \r\nRapporteur-General, UNCED) \r\nand environmentally sound development of all types of forest is the first \r\nglobal consensus achieved in this field. \r\nThe Rio Conference represented, for humankind, an important step forward \r\non the path towards sustainable development. However, history will remember \r\nnot so much what happened at Rio as how much was or was not achieved in \r\nimplementing the decisions taken there; in effect, future generations will be \r\nentitled to judge us not on the quality of the texts adopted at \r\nRio de Janeiro, but rather on whatever we do or fail to do to flesh out the \r\ncommitments that were undertaken there. \r\nThis means that we have yet to face up to the responsibilities that \r\nconstitute the real challenge of Rio. It certainly has put major and very \r\nspecial responsibilities on this session of the General Assembly. The General \r\nAssembly, having made its contribution to the Rio process, is now called upon \r\nto finish the job the Rio Conference began. Accordingly, the Assembly is \r\ncalled upon to follow up the many recommendations referred to it by the \r\nConference and to set up the institutional follow-up machinery envisaged \r\ntherein. Given this background, priority will have to be given to mobilizing \r\nthe new and additional financial resources needed to implement the \r\nundertakings made in the interest of the developing countries. In this \r\nrespect, the proposal that a pledging conference - to ensure that the \r\nactivities planned under Agenda 21 can be carried out should be called \r\nbefore the end of this year, is one that should be taken up. \r\nThe same is true for the proposal put forward by the tenth summit meeting \r\nof the Heads of State and Government of the Non-aligned Countries, which took \r\nplace in Jakarta in September, to convene, at a time to be agreed, a summit \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n33 \r\n(Mr. Brahimi, \r\nRapporteur-General. UNCED) \r\nmeeting to review and follow up the implementation of the decisions of the Rio \r\nConference. \r\nThe road to Rio was particularly complex and arduous, but the road that \r\nwe still must travel before we can rise to the level of the ideals proclaimed \r\nthere will be at least as rugged or perhaps even more so, since the road \r\nonwards from Rio will be more important that the road that led us there. \r\nTherefore, as I offer for your consideration the report of the United Nations \r\nConference on Environment and Development, which appears as document \r\nA/CONF.151/26, Volumes 1 to 5, with a view to your taking the necessary \r\ndecisions, I express the hope that your discussions here will make it possible \r\nto keep alive the flame of hope kindled at the Earth Svimmit so that the Rio \r\nspirit can continue to inspire our actions and guide our steps in our journey \r\nof solidarity towards our common future. \r\nMr. CARDOSO (Brazil); I have come to this session to signify the \r\nimportance Brazil attaches to the implementation of the decisions taken last \r\nJune at the United Nations Conference on Enviroiunent and Development (UNCED). \r\nThe peoples of the world were genuinely and deeply interested in what was \r\ndiscussed in Rio de Janeiro. At stake was the future of our planet. \r\nBut the Rio Conference did not end in Rio. The spirit that marked its \r\ndeliberations - which has been termed \"the spirit of Rio\" by \r\nSecretary-General Boutros-Ghali should project itself far beyond 1992. \r\nAs a Senator, I had the opportunity of drawing public attention to the \r\nConference, and I took part in the creation of a Parliamentary Committee that \r\nfollowed and supported the preparatory work. Next month Brazil will host the \r\nenvironment and development Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. How, \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n34-35 \r\n(Mr. Cardoso. Brazil) \r\nas Foreign Minister, I regard it as a great honour to ensure our participation \r\nin the common endeavour of implementing the results of the Rio Conference and \r\nof responding to the challenges we now have to face. \r\nAs the host country to UNCED, Brazil takes particular pride in an \r\nunprecedented United Nations event that can be identified as a major success. \r\nHhat emerged from Rio was a consensus on a broad array of subjects related to \r\nenvironment and development. The main virtue of this consensus lies in the \r\nvigorous contribution to the promotion of a major shift in international \r\nrelations, particularly in the way in which the North and the South \r\ninterrelate. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n36 \r\n(Mr. Cardoso. Brazil) \r\nAll countries are now partners in a common enterprise. The simple \r\ncategories of donor and recipient countries no longer apply. This new \r\npartnership expresses a logic of cooperation that rules out both confrontation \r\nand patronizing attitudes, a trend in which global negotiations are \r\nrelegitimized as a process for the fostering of world-wide understanding. \r\nMultilateralism has been strengthened by the realization that solutions to \r\nuniversal problems require universal and equitable participation. \r\nThe current process of redefining the directions and working methods of \r\nthe United Nations cannot but be enriched by that diplomatic turning-point, a \r\nmilestone among the Rio achievements. International cooperation for \r\ndevelopment was rescued from the condition of stalemate and stagnation in \r\nwhich it had been languishing for so long. Lifestyles based on waste and \r\nsquandering are now called into question, while the perpetuation of poverty \r\nhas finally been recognized as unacceptable. The United Nations Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development (UNCED) has thus become a referent, a point of \r\ndeparture for the establishment of new patterns for international cooperation, \r\nguided by the imperative need to address, jointly, the issues of environment \r\nand development. The link now firmly established between overdevelopment and \r\nunderdevelopment reinforces the certainty that environment and development \r\ncannot be dealt with separately, since the effective protection of the former \r\ndepends on the advancement of the latter. \r\nIt must be highlighted that UNCED sought neither a partial reorientation \r\nof economic activity nor the adoption of palliative, transitory measures. \r\nSimply stated, its objective was to redefine development and to carry this \r\nconcept to new levels of rationality and solidarity under the assumption. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Cardoso, Brazil) \r\naccepted by all, that this is the only way to guarantee sustainability and \r\ndecent living conditions for mankind as a whole. \r\nRio provided fertile ground for deliberations on universal problems with \r\nthe open and egalitarian participation of all States, big and small. This was \r\na true lesson of democracy in international relations. Consequently, a new \r\nstandard of interests and responsibilities emerged from these negotiations. \r\nRio also revealed a trend that has been created by the increasing \r\nparticipation of different sectors of society in discussions and activities \r\nrelated to environmental and developmental issues. In this connection the \r\nrole to be played by non-governamental organizations, as well as by the \r\nscientific and business sectors, promises great prospects for international \r\ncooperation in this post-UHCED period. \r\nAt UNCED, a new paradigm emerged around the concept of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. It seeks to assure, for the benefit of present and future \r\ngenerations, a rational balance between the legitimate aspirations of \r\nwell-being and development, on the one hand, and the maintenance of a healthy \r\nplanet, on the other. Sustainable development is the contemporary expression \r\nof progress. \r\nHith Agenda 21 and the other instruments agreed upon at Rio, developed \r\nand developing countries have recognized that they must undertake commitments \r\nin a spirit of mutuality, based on the principle of equal but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities. \r\nIn relation to the issue of forests, the international community was, for \r\nthe first time, able to take a stand, by consensus, on the conservation, \r\nmanagement and sustainable development of all types of forest through the \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n38 \r\n(Mr. Cardoso. Brazil) \r\nadoption of a political declaration and an action plan. It is important that \r\nthese arrangements be given sufficient time to work. \r\nThe two legal instruments opened for signature at the Rio Conference \r\nthe Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity \r\nsignify the determination of the international community to take appropriate \r\nsteps for the protection of particularly vulnerable areas of the environment. \r\nThey represent a highly relevant contribution to the development of \r\ninternational law in the field of sustainable development. \r\nInspired by the Rio Declaration, we must proceed. The Declaration is a \r\nproduct of this historical moment, pointing to the future without \r\nunderestimating or eluding contemporary problems, among which are those \r\nrelated to the disadvantageous positions of developing countries on the \r\ninternational scene. It is of special significance that a core element in the \r\nRio Declaration is the recognition that the right to development must be \r\nfulfilled so as equitably to meet the developmental and environmental needs of \r\npresent and future generations. \r\nBearing in mind the decisions and recommendations of the Conference, the \r\nLatin American and Caribbean countries set up a group that considered basic \r\nelements related to the establishment of the Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. Its conclusions were presented as a contribution to the \r\nactivities of the Group of 77. As a result, a position paper was agreed upon \r\nthat we regard as a sound basis for the deliberations of the General Assembly \r\non the matter. \r\nAgenda 21, whose implementation is to be followed by the Commission, is a \r\nbold programme of work, the largest ever adopted by the international \r\ncommunity. To meet the legitimate expectations it generated, it has to be put \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n39 \r\n(Mr. Cardoso. Brazil) \r\ninto effect in its entirety at the local, national, regional and universal \r\nlevels. Partial or misguided appraisals are pitfalls which must be avoided. \r\nTo that end, and in order to achieve the goal of sustainable development \r\nas defined in Agenda 21, it is imperative that the specific commitments \r\nencompassed in chapter 33 of the Agenda relative to new and additional \r\nfinancial resources be met through a flexible, transparent, democratic and \r\nuniversal approach to the financial mechanisms. \r\nBy the same token, the provisions related to transfer of technology are \r\ncrucial for the inception of the follow-up process and must be translated into \r\ntangible measures in the short term. Brazil hopes that at the forty-seventh \r\nof the General Assembly concrete pledges and commitments will be announced. \r\nIt is disquieting to note that during the five months since the Rio Conference \r\nno significant movement in terms of financial resources has been perceived \r\nthat could be identified with the commitments upon which the new world-wide \r\npartnership is to be constructed. \r\nIt is a matter of increasing concern that in the short but significant \r\npost-UNCED period the issue of the environment has become somewhat less \r\nevident in the agenda of meetings of developed countries. It now seems to \r\nreceive less attention than it deserves at meetings of important pohcy-making \r\nbodies. \r\nBrazil is determined to fulfil its responsibilities. President \r\nItamar Franco has decided to create a Ministry of the Environment, \r\ndemonstrating the priority he attaches to matters related to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\nThe spirit of Rio must prevail. That is our business here during this \r\nsession of the General Assembly. Brazil attaches special importance to the \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n40 \r\n(Mr. Cardoso. Brazil) \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development. The effective implementation of the \r\nnew framework for international cooperation will, to a large extent, depend on \r\nthe work to be carried out by this new body. \r\nIt is essential that it be given the necessary support in effectively \r\ncarrying out its functions, not the least among which is the unprecedented \r\nmandate to monitor matters related to chapter 33 on financial resources. \r\nWithout the appropriate provision of such resources neither will \r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 be possible nor the creation of the high-level \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development itself be justified. \r\nFor the Commission to be effective an appropriate degree of \r\nproportionality must be maintained. The implementation of the programme of \r\nwork calls not only for a high-level commission but also for a high-level \r\nsecretariat with a substantive capability and with adequate resources for the \r\nimplementation of Agenda 21. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n41 \r\n(Mr. Cardoso. Brazil) \r\nAs we see it, upon its establishment the Commission should have as one of \r\nits main aims the early promotion, publicizing and fulfilment of the \r\nprinciples embodied in the Rio Declaration. \r\nAs for Agenda 21, we must keep in mind that this blueprint for action is \r\nthe fruit of a negotiating process of a political and diplomatic nature. Its \r\nfollow-up shall therefore be entrusted to an intergovernmental body whose \r\ncomposition is to be essentially political. \r\nAttention must be paid to the need for precise specification of the role \r\nand competence of those sectors assigned to bring their relevant input to the \r\ndeliberations of governmental representatives. Otherwise the effectiveness of \r\nthe Commission could be put in jeopardy. \r\nThe establishment of the Commission should not, using the argument of \r\navoiding duplication of work within the system, lead to the elimination of \r\nother bodies which have their own specific and often complementary mandates. \r\nIt would indeed be a contradiction to tear down some of the pillars of \r\nthe system precisely at a time when so much effort is being directed to the \r\nstrengthening of United Nations responsiveness and ability to cope with the \r\never growing multiplicity and complexity of economic, social and scientific \r\nand technological problems affecting the international community. \r\nBrazil made the offer to host an international research centre on \r\nsustainable development. We hope that this initiative, which was welcomed \r\npositively in a resolution approved at the United Nations Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development (UNCED), will meet with the support of the \r\ninternational community. \r\nThe first measures for its implementation have already been taken. Its \r\npurpose will be to contribute to a better understanding of the concept of \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Cardoso. Brazil) \r\nsustainable development both in theory and in practice, thus becoming an \r\ninternational forum for the exchange of information, public education and \r\nresearch as regards the implementation of decisions taken in Rio. \r\nI have invited eminent personalities and experts to cooperate with this \r\nproject. Among them, I would mention Professor Celso Lafer, who as my \r\npredecessor headed the Brazilian delegation to the Rio Conference and acted as \r\none of its Vice-Presidents. I am grateful for what he has accomplished in \r\npreparing for the setting-up of the Centre. \r\nHe believe that solid ground has been carefully prepared for a new, \r\nfruitful era of international cooperation based on democratically negotiated \r\ncommitments and on the principles of international law. \r\nOne of the great accomplishments of UNCED was that of giving concrete \r\nshape to the notion that democratic participation cannot be disregarded, \r\neither domestically or internationally, if common goals are to be pursued. \r\nThat concept was brought forth at Rio in an exceedingly clear fashion, within \r\nthe context of a solid linkage between specific interests and universal \r\nconcerns. \r\nThat was a remarkable example of democracy at work. Let us carry on \r\nalong the same path. \r\nMr. MACLEAN (United Kingdom); I have the honour of speaking today \r\non behalf of the European Community and its member States. \r\nThe Earth Summit which took place in Rio de Janeiro in June has been \r\nrightly heralded as the most significant international meeting of its kind \r\nsince the founding fathers of the United Nations met in San Francisco almost \r\n50 years ago. We congratulate the Government and the generous people of \r\nBrazil for the hospitality and welcome they gave to us all at that momentous \r\nmeeting. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n43 \r\n(Mr. MacLean. United Kingdom) \r\nAs I think back to Rio and contemplate the work we have to do to fulfil \r\nthe commitments we entered into there, I am reinforced in my view of how \r\nimportant an event it was. The present state of the world economy, and the \r\ndifficulties facing many countries rich as well as poor, in the North as \r\nwell as in the South brings home to all of us the importance of the \r\ndevelopment aspect of the work of the United Nations Conference on Environment \r\nand Development (UNCED). It is legitimately the first objective of any \r\nGovernment to maintain the quality of life of its citizens. \r\nToday, even in the most developed of the world\u0027s economies, living \r\nstandards are coming under heavy pressure. We all face the urgent need to \r\nquicken economic activity, to provide a framework for sustainable growth. We \r\nneed such growth if we are to be able to address satisfactorily the other, \r\nenvironment, aspect of UNCED. And of course we are all now much more aware \r\nthat we face disaster unless we take account of the impact of our lifestyles \r\non the environment. \r\nUNCED was right! we cannot separate environment from development. Nor \r\ncan we separate North from South. There can be no question of one country or \r\ngroup of countries pushing their point of view upon others. More than a \r\ncentury ago the great English writer John Ruskin wrote, \"When we build let us \r\nthink that we build forever\". \r\nIn Rio we laid the foundations for a new approach to the problems of \r\nenvironment and development, which I believe in years to come will be seen as \r\nthe Summit\u0027s greatest achievement. UNCED was all about global cooperation, \r\ncooperation rooted in vision. There has never been a time in human history \r\nwhen foresight was more necessary to our future well being. We cannot of \r\ncourse foresee all or even most of what is to come. But some of what is to \r\ncome in the next decade is already painfully visible. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n44-45 \r\n(Mr. MacLean, United Kingdom) \r\nHe know, with some certainty, that there will be a billion more people on \r\nthe planet. We know that the protective ozone layer in the stratosphere will \r\nbe further depleted. We know that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the \r\natmosphere will have further increased. We cannot predict the speed and the \r\nextent of the global warming which will result. But we are told that a \r\nwarming effect of even point three of one degree centigrade per decade would \r\ngreatly exceed the capacity of our natural habitat to cope. \r\nWe know that every year an area of forest equal to the whole surface of \r\nEngland and Hales is destroyed forest which performs the vital function of \r\nremoving carbon dioxide from the air. We know too that if present trends \r\ncontinue some 240 billion tonnes more of top soil nearly 40 tonnes per \r\nperson - will have been washed away or scattered to the winds by the end of \r\nthe decade, a loss which is already affecting harvests in some of the world\u0027s \r\nmajor food producing regions. \r\nBut we bring to these problems new knowledge and new capabilities, the \r\nproduct of the extraordinary technological and other progress that has taken \r\nplace since the end of the Second Horld Har. No generation in history has had \r\nso many opportunities to improve the conditions of life. In today\u0027s world \r\nmore people are healthier and live longer than ever before. And yet more \r\npeople than ever before - one billion of them live in abject poverty. As we \r\nlook into the future it is clear that the gains that some of us have made and \r\nour prospects for helping those less fortunate will be jeopardized unless we \r\nare able to first halt, and then reverse, the depletion of the earth\u0027s natural \r\ncapital and the degradation of our environment. \r\nThe profound achievement of UNCED was to map out a strategy for dealing \r\nwith these vast and daunting problems. Its success was to turn the world\u0027s \r\nattention to solutions as well as problems. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n46 \r\n(Mr. MacLean. United Kingdom) \r\nHe are all familiar with the highlights of what was achieved in Rio: the \r\ntwo conventions on climate change and biodiversity the Rio Declaration, \r\nthe first global consensus on forests and the adoption of Agenda 21. These \r\nwere historic agreements. But unless we proceed rapidly to the implementation \r\nof the measures we agreed to in Rio, the political commitments of so many \r\nnational leaders and the tens of thousands of hours of analysis, discussion \r\nand negotiation will all have been for nought. \r\nThe European Community and its member States take the implementation of \r\nour Rio commitments very seriously. That is why, within days of the Rio \r\nSummit, we committed ourselves at the European Council in Lisbon to an \r\neight-point plan which envisages a vigorous programme of work to maintain \r\nmomentum on the road from Rio. The European Community as a whole has already \r\nundertaken to stabilize its carbon-dioxide emissions at the 1990 level by the \r\nyear 2000. We have begun work nationally and as a Community on developing \r\nstrategies showing how we intend to meet our commitments under the Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change, which we signed in Rio. These strategies are a \r\nprecursor to fulfilling our pledge to ratify the Convention, if possible, \r\nbefore the end of 1993. Ratification will only be a beginning; in time we \r\nwill need to consider what other undertakings will be required to fill out the \r\nframework. \r\nMay I take this opportunity to congratulate those countries that have \r\nalready completed their ratification processes and to urge all other countries \r\nto ratify the Convention as soon as possible. There is considerable work to \r\nbe done before the Convention enters into force and the first meeting of the \r\nConference of the Parties takes place. We therefore hope that this Assembly \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. MacLean. United Kingdom) \r\nwill give the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee an appropriate mandate \r\nand support to continue its activities until then. \r\nWe are also working within the Community to establish a basis for the \r\nearly ratification of the Convention on Biological Diversity, which the \r\nCommunity and its member States signed in Rio. We look forward to a \r\nresxjmption of the work of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee as soon \r\nas possible next year. In the meantime work on the preparation of national \r\nbiodiversity strategies has begun. This work will be much assisted by the \r\nrequirements of the Community\u0027s Habitats Directive, which offers protection to \r\nlarge nvunbers of scarce plants and animals in Europe. The Directive was \r\nadopted in May of this year and will come into force in 1995. \r\nThe European Community and its member States attach high importance to \r\nthe declaration on forest principles. It is a useful benchmark for future \r\nnational and international measures and instruments, including a possible \r\nforestry convention, and we have undertaken to publish national plans for \r\nimplementing these principles as well as a Community strategy. We are also \r\ncommitted to the establishment of an international review process for the \r\nprinciples. We propose that this task be undertaken by the high level \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development and believe this could lead to \r\nstrengthening international cooperation in this important area. \r\nThe need to address the issue of desertification was clearly recognized \r\nin Rio. The Lisbon Council endorsed our commitment to establishing an \r\ninternational process to begin preparing a convention on combating \r\ndesertification in those countries, particularly in Africa, experiencing \r\ndrought or desertification. The Community and its member States believe that \r\nthis session of the General Assembly should agree on the framework for such \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n48 \r\n(Mr. MacLean. United Kingdom) \r\nnegotiations, including the establishment of an intergovernmental negotiating \r\ncommittee along similar lines to that which successfully prepared the climate \r\nConvention. \r\nAgenda 21 is a far-reaching process. It is a framework for action on \r\nsustainable development; but it is a framework whose credibility depends on \r\nthe willingness of all of us to put our own houses in order. That is why the \r\nEuropean Community and its member States set such store by the preparation of \r\nnational and Community strategies for sustainable development which will \r\nentail integrating environmental policy with policy in other areas. This work \r\nis already well advanced. The Fifth Action Programme on the Environment, \r\nwhich I hope to see adopted before the end of this year, is the point of \r\ndeparture within the Community for the implementation of Agenda 21. It \r\nprovides a comprehensive framework for integrating all kinds of human \r\nactivities that affect the environment in order to move towards sustainability. \r\nThe Rio Summit has generated many national initiatives. My own \r\nGovernment will convene next year a global forum of non-governmental \r\norganizations to examine and clarify their roles in the practical \r\nimplementation of Agenda 21. The United Nations Conference on Environment and \r\nDevelopment (UNCED) stressed the importance of access to environmentally sound \r\ntechnology, and I should like to welcome here the initiative of the Government \r\nof Greece to organize the first international exhibition and conference on \r\nenvironmental technology for the Mediterranean region (HELECO), which will be \r\nheld in Athens next April. He also look forward to the meeting of the \r\nContracting Parties to the Montreal Protocol in Copenhagen later this month. \r\nAt the heart of the UNCED follow-up will be the high level Commission on \r\nSustainable Development, which we propose should meet in Geneva. The \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n49-50 \r\n(Mr. MacLean. United Kingdom) \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s helpful report on institutional arrangements to follow up \r\nUNCED makes clear that the creation of such a Commission involves many issues, \r\nof which I would like to highlight three. \r\nFirst, to be effective the Commission must have a highly qualified and \r\ncompetent secretariat, led by a high-ranking official, both to service the \r\nCommission and to act as an inter-agency focal point for coordination in the \r\nfield of sustainable development. \r\nSecond, we need a Commission that is open to new ideas and which provides \r\nfor the effective and ezihanced participation of non-governmental and other \r\nrelevant organizations, including international financial institutions and \r\nregional development banks. This Commission should focus on urgent policy \r\nissues which could be reviewed each year at a one- or two-day meeting of \r\nMinisters. It should provide, as UNCED did, for the European Community to \r\nparticipate fully. \r\nThird, the Commission\u0027s work must be organized so as to avoid the sterile \r\nand repetitive debates that have too frequently characterized the work of \r\nsubsidiary bodies established under the Economic and Social Council. We are \r\nstruck by the advantages of the segment-based approach of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council, which seems to me to provide a more attractive model on which \r\nto base the new Commission. He also recommend that the High-level Advisory \r\nBoard proposed at Rio, which will provide intellectual underpinning for the \r\nwork of the Commission, be merged with the Committee for Development Planning, \r\na body that has already acquired an enviable reputation in the United Nations \r\nsystem. \r\nOf course, putting our own house in order and establishing the Commission \r\non Sustainable Development are only part of what needs to be done to implement \r\nAgenda 21. We must also help others to play their part in our common cause. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. MacLean. United Kingdom) \r\nIt was agreed in Rio that, in general, the financing for the \r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 would come from a country\u0027s own public and private \r\nsectors. For developing countries, particularly the least developed \r\ncountries, official development assistance is a main source of external \r\nfunding, and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable \r\ndevelopment and implementation of Agenda 21 will be reguired. In Rio we \r\nreaffirmed our commitments to reach the accepted United Nations target of \r\n0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance as \r\nsoon as possible and to ensure prompt and effective implementation of \r\nAgenda 21. \r\nThe European Community and its member States are determined, in \r\nfulfilment of these commitments, to strengthen our assistance to developing \r\ncountries in the field of sustainable development and to increase our funding \r\nfor Agenda 21. Our commitment amounts to 3 billion European currency units, \r\nincluding significant new and additional resources for specific projects and \r\nprogrammes in key Agenda 21 sectors as an initial contribution to its early \r\nimplementation. Within each of those sectors, poverty reduction, technology \r\ntransfer and institutional capacity-building will be given very high \r\npriority. We are coordinating actively and urgently the development of this \r\ninitiative. He will continue to report on its implementation in the \r\ninstitutional follow-up to the Conference. \r\nHe are also committed to the Global Environment Facility, which exists to \r\nprovide additional grant and concessional funding to finance the agreed \r\nincremental costs of achieving agreed global environmental benefits. We \r\nenvisage that the Facility will become the permanent financial mechanism for \r\nthe Framework Conventions on the Conservation of Climate and of Biological \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. MacLean. United Kingdom) \r\nDiversity and other relevant global environmental conventions. For this \r\npurpose the Global Environment Facility should be appropriately restructured \r\nin accordance with chapter 33 of Agenda 21. We are committed to its \r\nreplenishment and to the provision of new and additional resources for this \r\npurpose. We also recognize the need to provide substantial financial \r\nresources to the International Development Association in order to promote \r\nsustainable development, and we will continue to give consideration to an \r\nEarth increment for environmental purposes. \r\nThere are many other important issues with which we will need to deal. I \r\nam conscious that the road from Rio will be more crowded than the road to Rio \r\nand that we will not succeed in making the life chances we have enjoyed \r\navailable to future generations unless we resolve the problems posed by the \r\nexpected doubling of the planet\u0027s population by the year 2050. We must make \r\nevery effort to ensure that the 1994 Cairo Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment strengthens global cooperation on these interrelated issues. \r\nI am conscious that all the plans and strategies in the world will make \r\nlittle difference to the well-being of those without guaranteed access to \r\nhuman rights and democratic freedoms. Achieving sustainable development is \r\nabove all a participative endeavour. It is difficult for those without \r\nfreedom to participate. \r\nThe road from Rio will be long and arduous, but the unprecedented \r\ngathering in Rio has set us off to a good start on this long march. It is our \r\nduty now not to falter at the first milestone. \r\nMr. ZAKI (Pakistan): It is a great honour for me to participate, on \r\nbehalf of Pakistan and the Group of 77, in the General Assembly\u0027s \r\nconsideration of the report of the United Nations Conference on Environment \r\nand Development (A/CONF.151/26, vols. I-IV). \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Zaki. Pakistan) \r\nI should like to take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-General and \r\nthe Rapporteur-General, the distinguished Foreign Minister of Algeria, for \r\ntheir reports on the Rio Conference. I should also like to express our \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General of the Conference, Mr. Maurice Strong, \r\nand to the staff of its secretariat, who worked hard to produce the final \r\ndocuments now before us. Our special thanks are also due to Brazil for making \r\nexcellent arrangements in hosting the Earth Summit. \r\nWe have listened with great interest to the statement of the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations regarding his plans for the \r\nrestructuring of the United Nations and its Secretariat. These original and \r\nfar-reaching proposals will be studied with the greatest interest by the \r\nmember States of the Group of 77, who are at present engaged in considering \r\nthe restructuring of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations \r\nunder item 47 of our agenda. \r\nThrough the golden ages of past civilizations, the harmony between nature \r\nand man remained basically undisturbed. The industrial revolution produced \r\nthe first signs of man\u0027s capacity to harness the forces of nature and to \r\nchange the balance between himself and his environment. This capacity has led \r\nto phenomenal growth in economic prosperity and technological advancement, \r\ntelescoping the pace of centuries into decades, years, months and days. \r\nWe, the men and women of this century, cannot but wonder at the \r\nachievements of our ingenuity and endeavour. Yet we must also frankly admit \r\nthat we have failed in at least two important respects. \r\nFirst, we have allowed economic and technological progress to be uneven, \r\nunequal and even exploitative. There is now greater disparity between the \r\nrich and the poor and between the advanced and the oppressed peoples of the \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n54-55 \r\n(Mr. Zaki. Pakistan) \r\nworld. The challenge of development today is not only to achieve growth, but \r\nto realize growth with equity and justice. This is a challenge among nations \r\nas well as within nations. Without introducing greater equity, the world will \r\nnot be able to sustain the political, social and technological structures \r\nwhich have provided the foundation for the dynamic acceleration of growth, \r\ninnovation and investment in the developed and many developing countries. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n56 \r\n(Mr. Zaki, Pakistan) \r\nOur second failure is that our strategies and patterns of growth have \r\nvirtually disregarded the impact of progress on our planet and on the delicate \r\nbalance between man and nature. Growth has been based largely on the \r\nconsumption of fossil fuels. Industrial processes have ignored the grave \r\nimpact on our rivers, lakes and ecological systems. Some schemes for rapid \r\ndevelopment have brutally devastated vast regions of the world. And poverty, \r\nmade worse by inequality and inequity, has obliged destitute peoples to \r\ndegrade their forests and lands in the race to keep up with the growing price \r\nof subsistence. Meanwhile, the inexorable growth in population is eating away \r\ntheir economic growth and threatens their environment and their social and \r\npolitical systems. \r\nThe Rio Conference was unique in the breadth of its concerns: the future \r\nwell-being of the human race and of our planet. With 120 Heads of State or \r\nGovernment in Rio, the high level of its participants was historic. Its \r\ndecisions the Rio Declaration, the programme of action called Agenda 21, and \r\nthe launching of the Conventions on biodiversity and climate change will \r\ncontinue to have vital importance for all our nations in the coming century. \r\nThe Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, participated \r\nin the Conference to underline his firm commitment to the promotion of \r\nenvironmentally sound development. A national conservation strategy has been \r\nelaborated and adopted in Pakistan. This will be used by the Government of \r\nPakistan as a guide to ensure that all its future development plans are in \r\nconsonance with the objective of arresting environmental deterioration. \r\nThis General Assembly is called upon to adopt the results of the Rio \r\nConference and to initiate the process of follow-up action, in particular the \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Zaki. Pakistan) \r\nimplementation of Agenda 21. The documents approved at Rio constitute an \r\nimportant advance towards global recognition of the twin imperatives of \r\ndevelopment with equity and development without damage to the environment. \r\nBoth these goals are not only essential but also mutually compatible and \r\nmutually reinforcing. \r\nThe intellectual and scientific debates relating to the Rio Conference \r\nhave led to a sharper political awareness in the industrial countries of the \r\nintimate relationship between the environment and development and the \r\ninterdependent nature of the world economy. They have also promoted a greater \r\nconsciousness in the developing countries that environmentally sound growth is \r\nthe most sustainable and desirable form of development. \r\nThe Rio Summit represents a new approach to development, a new concept of \r\na mutually dependent partnership for growth and survival, thus integrating the \r\naspirations of the developing countries and the concerns of the developed. \r\nThis new political compact provides the paradigm for action towards genuine \r\nprogress and global prosperity in the twenty-first century. \r\nAllow me to state, on behalf of the developing countries, and \r\nparticularly the members of the Group of 77, that we have accepted the \r\ncommitments flowing from the Rio Summit out of a sense of responsibility to \r\nour own peoples and to the future well-being of our planet. The commitments \r\nundertaken by the developing countries at the Rio Summit represent a historic \r\nleap in their political readiness to respond to the challenging requirements \r\nof environmentally sound development. \r\nWe must frankly express our sense of regret that the commitment to these \r\nglobal goals of the developed countries has not been at a similar level. They \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr. Zaki. Pakistan) \r\nremain preoccupied with their immediate economic, political and social \r\nproblems. The solidarity demanded by the new paradigm of environmentally \r\nsound development is limited if not absent in their policies relating to \r\ndevelopment assistance, trade liberalization and technological cooperation. \r\nThe Group of 77 is firmly of the view that the provision of adequate new \r\nand additional financing is an essential condition, a sine qua non, for the \r\neffective implementation of Agenda 21. It is obvious that the financing \r\nrequirements for Agenda 21 far exceed the resources which can be mobilized by \r\nthe developing countries. Additional external financing is required at the \r\nbilateral level and through multilateral channels to implement the projects \r\nand programmes for sustainable development in developing countries. The Group \r\nof 77 therefore calls for the full implementation of the commitments made in \r\nchapter 33 of Agenda 21 on financial resources and mechanisms. \r\nSustainable development should be promoted through the establishment of a \r\nCommission, as envisaged in Agenda 21. The Group of 77 has circulated a \r\ndocument setting out its views on the functions and structure of the \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development. The tasks of this Commission will be \r\nboth conceptual and practical. It must enhance the international cooperation \r\nrequired to integrate development and environmental issues. \r\nThe Commission on Sustainable Development should regularly review and \r\nmonitor the activities of various financing sources and mechanisms related to \r\nAgenda 21 in order to fulfil the objectives of chapter 33. It should also \r\nensure an effective link between the availability and maximization of new and \r\nadditional financial resources. \r\nWe believe that all sources and mechanisms, including the global \r\nenvironment facility, must regularly report to the Commission on Sustainable \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n59-60 \r\n(Mr. Zaki. Pakistan) \r\nDevelopment on the level of financing so that the Commission is able to \r\nmonitor effectively the availability of funds. The Global Environment \r\nFacility is only one of the mechanisms for the financing of Agenda 21, and the \r\nGroup of 77 attaches great importance to its restructuring in accordance with \r\nAgenda 21, especially to the principles of democratic governance and \r\ntransparency in decision-making and operations. This restructuring must be \r\nundertaken as soon as possible and should be reported and reviewed by the \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development at its first meeting early next year. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n61 \r\n(Mr. Zaki. Pakistan) \r\nAccess to technology too is a vital prerequisite for the success of the \r\ngoals of the Rio summit. We attach fundamental importance to the transfer of \r\ntechnology to the developing countries on preferential and concessionary \r\nterms. A conscious endeavour is required to promote the knowledge and \r\nexpertise required to implement environmentally sound development policies in \r\nthe developing counties. Without such capabilities the achievement of \r\nsustainable development in those countries will remain a mirage. \r\nTwo other issues require special action; desertification and the \r\nproblems of small island developing countries. He look forward to the \r\nestablishment of an intergovernmental negotiating committee to formulate a \r\nconvention to combat desertification. The Group of 77 further proposes that a \r\nglobal conference on the sustainable development of small island developing \r\nStates should be held in June 1993 to consider means to overcome the \r\ndisadvantages of those States. \r\nFurther action is also required to build on the two Conventions on \r\nbiological diversity and on climate change, respectively - which were opened \r\nfor signature at Rio. The financing mechanisms and sources, of which the \r\nGlobal Environment Facility is one, should report to the conferences of the \r\nparties to those Conventions. \r\nMuch of the world\u0027s finite resources is being depleted or degraded owing \r\nto unsustainable patterns of consumption and production in the developed \r\ncountries. It is well recognized that the present environmental crisis is due \r\nmainly to unrestrained and unsustainable consumption patterns and lifestyles \r\nin the developed countries. Unfortunately, Agenda 21 does not contain \r\nspecific commitments by the developed countries to address these issues. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Zaki. Pakistan) \r\nThe experience of inequality in the evolution of international economic \r\nrelations must not be repeated in the promotion of the new partnership which \r\nwas forged at the Rio summit to promote sustainable development. The \r\ndeveloping countries should not be asked to bear the brunt of sacrifices to \r\npreserve the world\u0027s environment and ecological system. They must not be \r\nasked to forgo development while the industrialized countries persist in their \r\npresent pattern of unrestrained consumption. \r\nAn important step that must now be taken is to determine specific \r\npolicies to create the external economic conditions that will enable the \r\ndeveloping countries to reach the goals of sustainable development. The most \r\nimportant of these conditions is access for the exports of developing \r\ncountries to the markets of the advanced nations, which continue to shutter \r\ntheir economies behind tariffs and non-tariff barriers. \r\nThe World Bank estimates that trade barriers cost the developing \r\ncountries about $100 billion in lost annual income in 1990 alone, an amount \r\nthat is twice the annual development assistance from the countries of the \r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development and, even more \r\nsignificant, is twice the annual interest paid by the developing countries on \r\ntheir public external debt. \r\nThe developed countries must overcome their squabbles over agriculture \r\nand speedily conclude the Uruguay Round. They must respond with courage and \r\nconviction to resist and reverse the forces of protectionism. They must \r\nresolve their differences on the fiscal and monetary policies which, together \r\nwith their protectionist tendencies, are worsening the impact of the current \r\nglobal recession. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. Zaki. Pakistan) \r\nThe momentum generated by the Rio Conference must not be allowed to \r\ndissipate. The spirit of cooperation displayed at Rio must guide us in the \r\nimplementation of Agenda 21. The post-Rio process must consolidate the gains \r\nand build on the agreements of Rio. There is an inescapable necessity for the \r\ninternational community to act in concert, to ensure for succeeding \r\ngenerations a pattern of sustainable growth. \r\nWe inherited this beautiful planet from our ancestors. It was full of \r\nthe bounties of nature, including fresh air and clean water. We have an \r\nobligation to pass this legacy to our children and grandchildren, free of \r\npollution and able to sustain and nurture life. We must therefore make \r\nsincere endeavours to realize the historic consensus that was forged at the \r\nRio Conference. \r\nMr. REILLY (United States of America); This week, as those who were \r\nin New York yesterday no do\\jbt discovered, is Marathon Week in New York City. \r\nAs members may know, the object of some runners in a marathon is to win. But \r\nfor most participants it is simply to finish, ideally in a good time. For \r\nmost participants the race, then, is against the clock, that is against \r\noneself. That, it seems to me, is not a bad metaphor for our own work at Rio \r\nand now here this week. We are engaged in a kind of marathon: a race against \r\nthe clock; a race against ourselves; a race for the planet; a race against the \r\nexhaustion of its natural systems and the destruction of its stability. \r\nFor almost half a century this body has been the repository of many of \r\nthe world\u0027s hopes for the future. The United Nations has fed the world\u0027s \r\nhungry, healed the sick and protected the oppressed. Through nearly 50 years \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n64-65 \r\n(Mr. Reilly. United States) \r\nof political change, war and peace, economic growth and recession, this \r\ninstitution has helped bind the nations of the world together in a common \r\nhumanitarian cause. \r\nToday we live in a world where change is more dramatic, more accelerated, \r\nmore far-reaching than ever. As political alliances shift, as fledgling \r\ndemocracies emerge from collapsed dictatorships, as national economies adjust \r\nto a growing interdependence in the global marketplace, we face staggering \r\nchallenges. \r\nNowhere is this change more evident, nowhere are the challenges more \r\ncompelling than in the global need for economic development that does not make \r\nyou sick, shorten your life or diminish your dignity: development, in sum, \r\nthat is environmentally sustainable. Nowhere do we see more clearly the \r\nimportance, the value of the United Nations. The people of the world must \r\nwork together to protect the global environment, and coordinated, cooperative \r\naction is the hallmark of the United Nations. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n66 \r\n(Mr. Reilly. United States) \r\nLast June, in Rio, over 170 countries met at one of the most important \r\nmultinational conferences in history. At Rio we recognized the danger to \r\nhuman survival and the impediment to economic development from the poisoning \r\nof our Earth, from the disruption of the planet\u0027s atmospheric equilibrium, \r\nfrom the degradation of human and ecological health, and from the depletion of \r\nour natural resources. After two years of preparatory negotiations, the Earth \r\nSummit had before it a number of significant, new international agreements and \r\nstatements; the Rio Declaration; the climate change Convention, which the \r\nUnited States has ratified; the Declaration of Forest Principles; Agenda 21; \r\nand the Convention on biodiversity. At Rio we also agreed to create a new \r\nbody within the United Nations, a Commission on Sustainable Development, to \r\nhelp implement Agenda 21 and help national economies grow in ways that protect \r\ntheir environmental support systems. \r\nThe forty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations \r\nis the first major test of the obligations we agreed in Rio. Here we must \r\nmove beyond the rhetoric of Rio. Here we must translate our Rio pledges into \r\nstrong, cooperative action. \r\nDuring this session, the United States looks forward to substantial \r\nprogress in several areas. We want to establish a strong basis for \r\nnegotiation of an international convention to combat desertification. We want \r\nto initiate serious discussions related to high seas fisheries, especially \r\nhighly migratory species and straddling stocks. We anticipate discussing ways \r\nto foster sustainable development in small island States. \r\nBut no issue in Agenda 21 is more important to us today than the creation \r\nof the Commission on Sustainable Development. My delegation believes that we \r\ncan and must put that machinery in place as soon as possible, so we can begin \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n67 \r\n(Mr. Reilly. United States) \r\nour substantive work as early as possible in the new year. While pressing \r\nforward on the goals of Agenda 21, this new Commission must be part of the \r\nongoing revitalization of the United Nations economic and social functions: \r\nefficient, innovative and built upon the resources available within the United \r\nNations. \r\nThis Commission must be a focus of international support for sustainable, \r\nenvironmentally sound development for generations to come. It must be \r\ncarefully, thoughtfully structured to help the emerging global market-place \r\nremain vigorous, while the natural systems and resources on which all human \r\nactivity depends remain healthy and productive. \r\nThere are several competing visions for this Commission. We believe that \r\nthe disparate and far-reaching commitments made in Rio need to be monitored, \r\nmeasured and piiblicized. The most comprehensive and ambitious of the Rio \r\ndocuments is Agenda 21. As a voluntary, non-binding statement of intentions \r\nit has no home or parent, no protector or patron. The Commission on \r\nSustainable Development should undertake this role. \r\nI foresee a Commission charged with the responsibility to chart the \r\nprogress and chronicle the digressions along the road from Rio. I envisage a \r\nCommission which, while not exercising coercive power, uses the moral \r\nauthority of this body to remind the world and specific countries as \r\nappropriate of practical opportunities to further sustainable development, \r\nand of shortcomings and failures, the strengths and also the weaknesses of \r\npolicies, priorities and projects. \r\nThere is no other appropriate institution to perform this essential \r\nfunction. To do so effectively the Commission will need a strong and \r\nrespected voice, leadership of stature, and international support. It will \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n68 \r\n(Mr. Reilly. United States) \r\nneed professional staff and the capacity to draw on the technical resources of \r\nother United Nations institutions. \r\nTo ensure that the Commission fulfils the vision proposed for it at Rio \r\nit should review and report on the progress of nations in implementing \r\nAgenda 21; it should draw on the work of United Nations agencies to follow the \r\ncritical issues raised in Agenda 21 deforestation, the relationship between \r\npoverty and environmental degradation, the human misery caused by polluted \r\ndrinking water and lack of sanitation, desertification, and others; it should \r\nencourage review of subsidies for unsustainable development and promote \r\nconsideration of measures aimed at ending them; and it should promote review \r\nof the environmental effects and sustainability of major development projects, \r\nespecially those of the Horld Bank and of regional development banks. Its \r\nrules of procedure must be flexible so that those with genuine expertise in \r\nsustainable development can contribute to its work, and it must ensure that \r\nnon-governmental organizations are significantly involved in its work in an \r\nappropriate way as valued partners. \r\nThe Commission on Sustainable Development will address a key question \r\nfacing nations today: how do we expand our economies to meet the aspirations \r\nof our people, while still protecting human health and the natural resources \r\non which lasting economic growth depends? How we answer this question will \r\ndefine our quality of life in the twenty-first century. Thus the United \r\nStates supports the idea of the Coimnission and the goals of the Commission, \r\nand we shall support the Commission in its operations as well. \r\nIn 1993, United States total overseas development assistance will grow to \r\nmore than $11 billion, a nearly 4 per cent increase over 1992. Some of the \r\nincrease will come from additional contributions to multilateral programmes \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n69 \r\n(Mr. Reilly. United States) \r\nand funds. Our contribution to the United Nations Development Programme will \r\ngrow by 9 per cent, to $125 million; United States funding for the United \r\nNations Environment Programme will rise by 21 per cent, to $22 million. For \r\nthe Montreal Protocol, we intend to provide $28 million in 1993, compared to \r\njust over $18 million in 1992. \r\nNext month the parties to the Montreal Protocol will meet in Copenhagen \r\nto consider bringing forward the date at which nations phase out manufacture \r\nof ozone-depleting substances. The United States Government will phase out \r\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by the end of 1995. He strongly believe that all \r\ndeveloped countries should agree to do the same. He also strongly believe \r\nthat developing countries should consider following the example of Mexico and \r\nThailand and agree to cease production of CFCs by the year 2000. But we \r\nrecognize that they will need financial help to make the transition to less \r\nharmful substitutes. Therefore we are committed to continuing the Montreal \r\nProtocol Fund and replenishing it at an appropriate level to meet identified \r\nneeds. This, it seems clear to me, is the bargain reached with the developing \r\nnations when the London Agreements were consummated in the summer of 1990, and \r\nwe strongly encourage other developed nations to join us in making this new \r\nfinancial commitment to maintaining a healthy, independent Montreal Protocol \r\nFund. \r\nTotal United States contributions to multilateral development banks in \r\n1993 will be nearly $1.6 billion, including a new contribution of $90 million \r\nfor the Multilateral Investment Fund of the Inter-American Development Bank. \r\nNow, as these figures show, the United States commitment to the United Nations \r\nand to the international community is stronger than ever. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n70 \r\n(Mr. Reilly. United States) \r\nAt the same time, it is important to remember that there is more the \r\nUnited States can and will do, there is more all nations can and must - do, \r\nto support sustainable development world-wide. Economic and environmental \r\nhistory suggests that poverty and environmental degradation go hand in hand. \r\nThe poorest people suffer from the most polluted drinking water, lack of \r\nsewage treatment and improper disposal of wastes. Only economic growth can \r\nbring the financial and technical resources necessary to protect human health \r\nand natural systems. In fact, economic growth itself is one of our most \r\npowerful tools for protecting the environment. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n71 \r\n(Mr. Reilly. United States) \r\nTo stimulate economic growth and support sustainable development, we must \r\nensure that the fundamental pillars of a strong market economy are built in \r\nevery nation. This requires debt reform, open investment policies and trade \r\nliberalization. The United States has advanced these principles with our \r\n\"Enterprise for the Americas\" initiative. He will continue to push for \r\ngrowth-stimulating reform through the North American Free Trade Agreement, \r\ndebt-for-nature swaps, expanded environmental efforts in the multilateral \r\ndevelopment banks, and expanded technical cooperation with nations around the \r\nworld. All this, I am convinced, will lead to increased global investments in \r\nenvironmental protection. \r\nI can think of no better example of the environmental opportunities \r\noffered by economic reform than that of our good neighbour Mexico. Over the \r\npast several years, Mexico\u0027s economy has grown at a record-setting pace. \r\nBecause of Mexico\u0027s move toward open investment, debt reform, free trade and \r\nprivatization, more than $25 billion in foreign investment has flowed into \r\nthat country. During the same period, Mexico\u0027s investment in environmental \r\nprotection has grown to the point where it is now 1 per cent of gross national \r\nproduct. \r\nThe lesson here is clear: even as we build new international \r\ninstitutions, even as we broaden intergovernmental cooperation, we must \r\nstrengthen our national economies by tearing down the barriers to free trade. \r\nThe economic benefits of free trade will do more to protect the global \r\nenvironment thah we could ever expect from foreign aid alone. \r\nWe in the United States cherish our political and economic freedom. We \r\nbelieve it is no coincidence that the American Declaration of Independence and \r\nAdam Smith\u0027s The Wealth of Nations were both written in the same year. In out \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n72 \r\n(Mr. Reilly. United States) \r\ncountry, free markets and individual liberty are mutually supporting and bound \r\ntogether. \r\nEnvironmental policy may well be the single most successful of all United \r\nStates domestic policies of the past 20 years. The United States was the \r\nfirst country to enact comprehensive national environmental laws, and \r\nenvironmental conditions today are far better than they were 20 years ago, in \r\nurban air and water quality, in nature protection, in park and wilderness \r\nprotection and in the revival of endangered wildlife. Most important, we made \r\nthis environmental progress while our economy continued to grow. Economic \r\ngrowth financed our environmental investments. Economic growth and \r\nenvironmental protection can go hand-in-hand. \r\nThe American people support the goals of Agenda 21. We support a \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development with a strong voice and a significant \r\nrole. We believe in sustainable development because it is increasingly a \r\nvalued and successful part of our own national experience. Let us then create \r\nthe Commission on Sustainable Development now, so that we can get on with the \r\nrace on the road from Rio in the spirit of long-distance runners, with our eye \r\non the clock. \r\nMr. TOPFER (Germany); At the start of today\u0027s debate, the \r\nrepresentative of the United Kingdom, my colleague David MacLean, outlined the \r\nposition of the European Community and its member States on the report of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development. The Federal \r\nRepublic of Germany supports this view. In the light of the special political \r\nsignificance my Government attaches to the follow-up of the Earth Summit in \r\nHio, I should like to add the following. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n73 \r\n(Mr. Topfer. Germanv) \r\nWe have concluded a final act of Rio. Each of its elements the Rio \r\nDeclaration, Agenda 21 and the statement on forest principles is important \r\nin itself, as are the Conventions signed in Rio on climate change and \r\nbiodiversity. All the results are geared towards an honest, committed \r\nfollow-up process in a global partnership of environment and development. The \r\nglobal Rio process for economic, social and environmental development and \r\ncooperation must become as successful as the Helsinki process is for security \r\nand cooperation in Europe. \r\nThe crucial challenge facing us as industrialized countries is laid down \r\nin the Rio Declaration, namely the special responsibility we bear in view of \r\nthe pressures we have placed on the global environment and of the technologies \r\nand financial resources we command. \r\nThe \"spirit of Rio\", which we were happily able to help engender, must \r\nnow prove its worth in practice, in particular in an era where the global \r\neconomic framework is making this more rather than less difficult. \r\nThe United Nations has contributed substantially to the end of the \r\nEast-West conflict and has emerged from it in a strengthened position. It has \r\na central role to play in securing and maintaining peace. This is to a large \r\nextent thanks to the resolve and vigour demonstrated by the \r\nSecretary-General. We must use the capacities thus released to avoid a new \r\nconflict between rich and poor, between north, east and south. \r\nThe United Nations is also essential to solving global environment and \r\ndevelopment problems. The preservation of creation, the overcoming of \r\nunderdevelopment and the halting of the destruction of the environment are \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n74 \r\n(Mr. Topfer. Germany) \r\nintegral elements of a sustainable new world order geared towards securing \r\npeace. We need a foreign policy on economic development and cooperation and \r\non the environment, both by States and by the United Nations. \r\nHe need a strengthened, internationally coordinated environmental and \r\ndevelopment competence: we must gear the United Nations Environment Programme \r\n(UNEP) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to the new \r\nchallenges we face. They must be put in a position where they are able to \r\nfulfil the tasks set down in Agenda 21, the manual of environment and \r\ndevelopment cooperation. \r\nThe innovative approach taken in Rio, however, lies in integrating \r\nenvironment and development two sides of the same coin. This is the major \r\ntask of the new high-level United Nations Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. It must act as a coordinating link not only between UNEP and \r\nUNDP, but also among all the Members of the United Nations family, national \r\nGovernments and representatives of the non-governmental sector. A \r\ncomprehensive catalogue of measures will make it a significant force in the \r\nfollow-up to Rio. \r\nGiven the significance of the questions at hand, in particular the need \r\nto keep the public at large focused on them, we, together with our partners in \r\nthe European Community, are striving to ensure that this Commission also comes \r\ntogether at the ministerial level during its yearly meetings. Negotiations \r\nthat took place during the concluding days of the Earth Summit in Rio also \r\nshowed that important, controversial problems can often be solved only at this \r\nlevel. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n75 \r\n(Mr. Topfer. Germany) \r\nWe must use this unique and historic chance for an integrative \r\ninterlocking of all institutions of the United Nations system. We must \r\nconcentrate all energies on perceiving early and meeting constructively the \r\nhuge challenges facing us in the economic, social and environmental fields. \r\nHe welcome the proposals of the Secretary-General to link closely the \r\ninstitutional follow-up to Rio with the restructuring measures he so \r\nvigorously initiated in the economic and social sector. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n76 \r\n(Mr. Topfer. Germany) \r\nWe encourage the Secretary-General to proceed purposefully with this reform \r\ntask. The United Nations must become an institution that pursues its goals in \r\nthe economic, social and environmental field as responsibly and as urgently as \r\nit fulfils its obligations in the area of peace and security. At the same \r\ntime, we underline the necessity of regionalization or, as we call it in the \r\nEuropean Communities, of subsidiarity. \r\nHe need to translate the Rio results promptly into practical action. Our \r\npriorities are the following. \r\nOur first priority is immediate ratification and prompt implementation of \r\nthe Conventions. They must prove to be dynamic instruments to further world-\r\nwide cooperation in combating the serious global problems. \r\nThis week, my Government will pass the Act ratifying the Climate \r\nConvention and forward it to parliament immediately. By the end of the year, \r\nwe will submit to the secretariat of the Intergovernmental Negotiating \r\nCommittee in Geneva our first national report on the steps we have taken to \r\nimplement the Convention. It is our national target to reduce carbon dioxide \r\nemissions by 25 per cent to 30 per cent by the year 2005 on the basis of 1987 \r\nlevels. A whole range of measures to achieve this target have already been \r\nintroduced; more are being prepared. \r\nIn Rio, the European Communities and their member States once again \r\naffirmed their target of stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions throughout the \r\nCommunities by the year 2000. Germany is pressing for the introduction of a \r\ncarbon dioxide energy tax as an important instrument in the Communities\u0027 \r\nstrategy. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n77 \r\n(Mr. Topfer. Germanv) \r\nIn Rio de Janeiro the Federal Chancellor of Germany, Mr. Helmut Kohl, \r\noffered to host the first Conference of the Contracting Parties to the Climate \r\nConvention in Germany. He would be very happy if the General Assembly would \r\nsupport our invitation. The Conference is designed to bring about progress in \r\nimplementing the Convention, developing it further and making its provisions \r\nmore stringent. \r\nPrompt implementation should also be a priority for the Convention on \r\nBiological Diversity at the next meeting of the Governing Council of the \r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). He welcome and support the steps \r\nthat have been taken in this regard by the Executive Director of UNEP, \r\nMr. Tolba, and the support by the Global Environment Facility (GEF). \r\nHe shall strengthen our cooperation with developing countries, as well as \r\nwith the countries of Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent \r\nStates (CIS) to help them also to promptly implement these Conventions. To \r\nthis end, we will allocate a total of DM 10 million in additional funds in \r\n1993 for short-term programmes for the rapid implementation of both \r\nConventions, in cooperation with developing countries. \r\nIn order to achieve the global convention on desertification by 1994, we \r\nshall support the establishment by the General Assembly of an \r\nintergovernmental negotiating committee. The same priority must be attached \r\nto the protection of water, especially of drinking water. \r\nOur second priority is implementation and further development of the \r\nforest principles. The forest principles agreed on in Rio form a good basis \r\nfor effective measures to manage, conserve and sustainably develop forests \r\nthroughout the world. He must now implement these at the national level and \r\ngear our international cooperation towards them. I am convinced that on this \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n78 \r\n(Mr. Topfer. Germany) \r\nbasis it will be possible for us to have a constructive dialogue on the \r\nimplementation, review and further development of these principles in the \r\nCommission for Sustainable Development with a view to drafting further \r\ninternational agreements. \r\nOur third priority is new forms of international economic relations. In \r\norder to improve living conditions for their people, developing countries need \r\nto strengthen and make full use of their own capacities rather than to be the \r\nrecipient of external support. Therefore, we must break down trade barriers \r\nand open up our markets to give weaker economies better opportunities to \r\nproceed with sustainable development under their own steam. We all agree on \r\nthe tremendous importance of a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round. \r\nWith regard to the question of trade and the environment, we believe that \r\nparticular priority must be given in future to international cooperation, \r\nespecially in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the United \r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). This means not only \r\navoiding the creation by environmental regulations of unjustified trade \r\nbarriers. If we are serious about the principle enshrined in the Rio \r\nDeclaration on internalizing external costs and about the provisions of \r\nAgenda 21, we must also commit trade policy to sound environmental practice \r\nand the preservation of resources in other words, to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\nOur fourth priority is new economic behaviour and new living patterns. \r\nAn essential element of sustainable economic behaviour and sustainable living \r\npatterns lies primarily in changes to our own behaviour as producers and \r\nconsumers. He in the industrialized countries have a particular \r\nresponsibility in this regard, given the major part we play in global \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n79 \r\n(Mr. Topfer, Germany) \r\nenvironmental damage. Only by gearing in particular economic, energy, \r\ntransport and agricultural policy towards the principles of sound \r\nenvironmental practice will it be possible to achieve sustainable development. \r\nIt will not be possible to achieve sustainable development without \r\nconsistently implementing a life cycle concept that evaluates the \r\nenvironmental soundness of a product from manufacture to disposal, from cradle \r\nto grave. In Germany we are paying particular attention to waste policy in \r\norder to move away from the \"throw away\" society towards environmentally sound \r\nproducts and production techniques. \r\nThe prices of our products and services must also reflect the costs they \r\nentail for the environment. We must continue to promote the use of economic \r\ninstruments and market incentives. This is the best way to engender \r\nenvironmentally sound technological progress, which should also be transferred \r\nwithin the framework of technological cooperation. Instruments such as these \r\ncan, moreover, be innovative sources of finance for measures to promote \r\nsustainable development. \r\nAn important prerequisite for a change in the behaviour of all our \r\ncitizens towards more environmental compatibility is education and training, \r\ninstruction and information. These elements must promote and strengthen \r\nawareness of the fact that each individual has to play his or her part in \r\nensuring sustainable development in order to guarantee our joint survival on \r\nthis planet. Given the limited resources at our disposal and the poverty gulf \r\nbetween North and South, East and West, the thinking in terms of entitlement \r\nand possession is also coming under scrutiny. \r\nOur fifth priority is combating poverty. In order to remove the causes \r\nof poverty, structural reforms are essential. This means the creation of an \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n80 \r\n(Mr. Topfer. Germany) \r\neconomic, political and social framework at the national and international \r\nlevel to reduce poverty. Participation by the people, as well as close \r\nintegration with environmental protection and sustainable management of \r\nresources are new elements of our joint strategy to combat poverty, as \r\ndeveloped in Agenda 21. \r\nGerman development cooperation views efforts to combat poverty as a \r\npriority task, and is involved in a great many projects in all areas receiving \r\nassistance. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n81 \r\n(Mr. Topfer. Germany) \r\nOur sixth priority is population policy. Sustainable development cannot \r\nbe achieved without a responsible population policy. We all know that \r\nmeasures for the advancement of women and for family planning are particularly \r\neffective or even effective only if they are combined into integrated \r\nprogrammes alongside measures to combat the underlying causes of rapid \r\npopulation growth, poverty and underdevelopment. That is the only way to \r\nescape from this vicious circle. An improvement in the social and economic \r\nposition of women in developing countries is essential. People must be given \r\nthe right to determine the size of their families as their own responsibility. \r\nOur seventh priority is technological cooperation, the spreading of \r\nknowledge and capacity building. Modern, environmentally sound technologies \r\nmust increasingly be used throughout the world, in particular in the fields of \r\nenergy and transport and industrial and agricultural production. Enlarging \r\ninstitutional and technical capacities - in particular in developing \r\ncountries - for choosing and applying suitable and adapted technologies is \r\nalready a major element in German bilateral cooperation in the field of \r\nenvironment and development. He give our wholehearted support to the \r\nCapacity 21 programme of the United Nations Development Programme and have \r\nalready made budgetary provisions to support it. \r\nHe support the setting up of technology consultation centres, in \r\nparticular in cooperation with industry. He have therefore set up such a \r\ncentre in South-East Asia, in cooperation with Singapore, and are seeking \r\nsimilar cooperation in Eastern Europe and in the Commonwealth of Independent \r\nStates. Hithin the European Community, we are currently working on the \r\nestablishment of such a centre in Africa. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n82 \r\n(Mr. Topfer. Germany) \r\nOur eighth priority is financial questions. In Rio the Federal \r\nChancellor, Mr. Kohl, made clear our determination to live up to our \r\nresponsibility vis-a-vis the developing countries. In spite of the \r\nexceptional situation in the wake of German unification and our tremendous \r\ncontribution to the process of reconstruction in the countries of Central and \r\nEastern Europe and of the Commonwealth of Independent States, we shall make \r\nevery effort to do justice to the financial commitment made in Rio. \r\nHe continue to support the tripling of the size of the Global Environment \r\nFacility combined with a fair burden-sharing. The ongoing restructuring of \r\nthe Global Environment Facility should be concluded promptly, including, in \r\nparticular, adequate participation by developing countries in decision-making, \r\nin accordance with Agenda 21. \r\nHe consider it vital that the tenth replenishment of the International \r\nDevelopment Association should maintain its value in real terms and that an \r\nEarth increment should be decided on. We are also prepared for the provision \r\nof further relief within the framework of the debt-servicing agreements of the \r\nParis Club if the resources thus released are made available for measures to \r\nprotect and maintain the environment. \r\nOur ninth priority is that the aid we give can only help towards self-\r\nhelp. The developing countries and the countries of Eastern Europe and the \r\nCommonwealth of Independent States must use their own resources for \r\nsustainable development by taking action under their own steam, by creating \r\nsuitable economic conditions and by ensuring democratic development and \r\neffective government. There are many hopeful beginnings. The decisions taken \r\nby the Conference of non-aligned States in Jakarta show encouraging progress, \r\ntoo. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n83 \r\n(Mr. Topfer. Germanv) \r\nOur tenth priority is that environmental destruction is a threat to peace \r\nand a threat to mankind. The large-scale, serious destruction of the \r\nenvironment is a topic that is of basic concern to us with a view to possible \r\nfuture conflicts, both in times of war and in times of peace. We welcome the \r\nwork being done by the International Law Commission on environmental crime. \r\nIt must be possible to bring before an international criminal court crimes \r\nsuch as genocide, the gravest violations of human rights, and far-reaching, \r\nserious damage to the environment. The international community must be \r\nenabled to punish such massive violations of international law. Rio has not \r\nhelped us make much progress in this regard. I therefore consider that \r\nrelevant, more-far-reaching decisions by the General Assembly are necessary. \r\nIt seems to me to be equally urgent that the international community be \r\nbetter equipped for environmental accidents and disasters. We need \"Green \r\nHelmets\" as a quickly available task force of voluntary experts from various \r\ncountries comparable to the \"Blue Helmets\" of the United Nations peace-keeping \r\nforces. These experts must be able to be summoned by the United Nations \r\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP) on short notice for immediate deployment on \r\nsite. The United Nations Centre for Urgent Environmental Assistance, decided \r\non by the UNEP Governing Council in 1991 and now set up in Geneva, must be \r\nconsistently promoted and expanded with this objective in mind. \r\nAll this shows us once again that securing and maintaining peace can be \r\nachieved permanently only if it also covers comprehensively the economic, \r\nsocial and environmental spheres; therefore, these are requirements for a kind \r\nof security council as well. \r\nA/47/PV.52 \r\n84 \r\n(Mr. Topfer. Germanv) \r\nThe Conference in Rio was an important milestone for us. However, we \r\nshall be able to consolidate the success of this event only if, by means of a \r\ncontinuing, dynamic process backed up by world-wide solidarity and joint \r\naction in global partnership, we secure the basic conditions for sustainable \r\ndevelopment and thus for the survival of humanity on this planet. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.30 p.m. \r\n"
