May I remind members that, in accordance with the \r\ndecision taken this morning, the list of speakers in the debate on this item \r\nwill be closed today at 5 p.m. I therefore request those representatives \r\nwishing to participate in the debate to inscribe their names on the list of \r\nspeakers as soon as possible. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n6 \r\nMr. LEE (Republic of Korea)! Last June in Rio world leaders \r\nestablished a long path into the future, a future which has yet to reveal \r\nitself to us today. This forty-seventh session of the General Assembly \r\nrepresents one of the first major milestones on that path, and after we have \r\npassed it we shall be one step closer to knowing what lies ahead for future \r\ngenerations. We shall have a better idea of our collective ability to \r\ngenerate the global partnership needed to protect the world and its people, \r\nand we shall understand the level of commitment and the level of compromise \r\nnecessary to embark on a truly universal effort in support of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\nThe Earth Summit demonstrated the many challenges involved in bridging \r\nthe differences between nations. Nevertheless, the resulting agreements, most \r\nnotably the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21, also reflected the global \r\nrecognition of the need for cooperation between developed and developing \r\nnations. However, much still remains to be done. Only the future, then, can \r\ntell us whether the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development \r\n(UNCED) was a pivotal turning-point in the history of environmental and \r\ndevelopmental efforts or merely an ill-fated attempt at realizing an ideal. \r\nDuring this session we must discover what is possible. We must respond to the \r\nurgency and the extent of the environmental deterioration of our planet while \r\nfully considering the right of all people to live healthy and productive \r\nlives. \r\nThe principles included in the Rio Declaration collectively reflect the \r\nfundamental concept underlying sustainable development. Individually, they \r\npinpoint the steps needed to achieve sustainable development, including the \r\ncreation of a global partnership based on common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities enhanced by the transfer of technology, as well as the \r\nprohibition of unjustifiable restrictions on international trade. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n7 \r\n(Mr. Lee. Republic of Korea) \r\nUndoubtedly, of the most important issues to be resolved, financing the \r\nnecessary measures contained in Agenda 21 is first and foremost. The share of \r\nthe financial burden of Agenda 21-related activities assumed by each country \r\nshould be proportional to the country\u0027s ability to pay and its cumulative \r\ncontribution to global pollution. For their part, developed countries have \r\nbeen called upon to contribute approximately $125 billion annually to the \r\nUNCED follow-up process and to increase official development assistance for \r\nthis purpose. \r\nThe effective implementation of Agenda 21 will necessarily require \r\nsubstantial assistance in the form of technology transfers from developed \r\ncountries. Many developing nations, including the Republic of Korea, are \r\nfacing some difficulties in pursuing environmentally sound development owing \r\nto the limited availability of environmentally benign technologies. \r\nIn this context the developed countries must play a leading role in \r\npromoting the transfer of technology. Chapter 34 of Agenda 21 emphasizes the \r\nneed for developed countries to make an essential contribution to developing \r\ncountries in the form of environmentally sound technologies. During the \r\nConference the Republic of Korea was an active participant in the negotiations \r\non chapter 34, and, accordingly, we will actively participate in efforts to \r\ndevise the mechanisms for facilitating global technology transfers. In \r\nparticular, I support the idea of the purchase of environmentally sound \r\ntechnology by international bodies such as the International Bank for \r\nReconstruction and Development and the International Development Association, \r\nwhich should provide such technology on non-commercial terms to developing \r\ncountries. \r\nWe cannot overlook the fact that the most valuable resource of each and \r\nevery country is its people. Shifting government expenditures to education \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n8-10 \r\n(Mr. Lee. Republic of Korea) \r\nand other social services must be recognized as the soundest investment for \r\nlong-term development. Providing basic education to the many, as opposed to \r\nhigher education for the few, should be seen as an underlying principle of \r\npublic investment. Education for women, in particular, will reap substantial \r\nbenefits for society, including lower population-growth rates. \r\nInasmuch as individual countries are committed to nurturing a global \r\npartnership, a sufficiently empowered multilateral organ is needed to oversee \r\nand monitor future progress. To ensure success in achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment on a global scale we should now focus on targets and schedules \r\nrather than on speeches and declarations. It is time for the international \r\ncommunity to focus its efforts on making the Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment an effective instrument for monitoring UNCED follow-up actions. \r\nThe Republic of Korea welcomes many of the institutional proposals for \r\nthe establishment of the Commission on Sustainable Development. The \r\nCommission, which my Government aspires to join, should be provided with a \r\nstrong and detailed mandate and with a membership that reflects due \r\nconsideration for equitable geographical distribution. Moreover, in \r\ndetermining the organizational structure of the Commission, we would do well \r\nto give full consideration to the ongoing process of revitalization and \r\nrestructuring of the United Nations system in the economic, social and related \r\nfields. \r\nNon-governmental organizations also merit a participatory role in the \r\nCommission\u0027s activities. Given their often intimate relationship with the \r\nmany communities that form the primary foundation for sustainable development, \r\nnon-governmental organizations can contribute much to the global dialogue. In \r\nthis respect, concrete and practical measures should be taken to encourage and \r\nsupport the representation of non-governmental organizations in the work of \r\nthe Commission. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n11 \r\n(Mr. Lee. Republic of Korea) \r\nIn the light of the need for a strong secretariat support structure to \r\nensure the success of the UNCED follow-up process, we believe that the \r\nSecretary-General has a crucial task, as chief administrative officer of the \r\nOrganization, in establishing a small, action-oriented and \r\nprofessionally-staffed body, headed by a senior official with direct contact \r\nwith the Secretary-General. He trust that this collaboration will prove \r\nextremely productive in terms of advancing the work of both intergovernmental \r\nand inter-agency coordination mechanisms. \r\nNow I should like to draw attention to the progress of our efforts \r\nregarding UNCED follow-up activities. These days, the notion of sustainable \r\ndevelopment has rapidly spread to the people and policy-makers of Korea, \r\nespecially after UNCED. Social awareness of the link between environment and \r\ndevelopment is being promoted throughout the country by the media and other \r\norganizations, including women\u0027s and consumers\u0027 interest groups. \r\nIn order to accommodate the changing nature of the global environmental \r\nproblems after UNCED, our Government has established a ministerial committee \r\non the global environment, which is headed by the Prime Minister. The \r\ncommittee not only sets goals but also draws up solid action plans with \r\nacceptable time-frames for UNCED follow-up measures. The conclusions of the \r\ncommittee will be incorporated in the Five-Year National Economic and Social \r\nDevelopment Plan in order to guide implementation strategies affecting the \r\nenvironment. I expect that these efforts can promote environmentally sound \r\nand sustainable development and propel Korea to an even higher level of \r\nachievement than that environed in Agenda 21. \r\nTo solve environmental problems in a realistic and concrete manner, the \r\nRepublic of Korea has begun to strengthen various environmental regulations in \r\nA/47/PV. 53 \r\n12 \r\n(Mr. Lee. Republic of Korea) \r\norder to improve the quality of life. We have implemented measures to \r\ninternalize the environmental costs by expanding the \"polluter pays \r\nprinciple\", with an environmental charge system. In order to enhance \r\nprecautionary policies, the Government is drafting the environmental impact \r\nassessment law to bring about greater progress in the current environmental \r\nimpact assessment system. \r\nFor the effective implementation of UNCED follow-up programmes in the \r\nlong run, the Government places greater emphasis on reforming the industrial \r\nstructure to make it less energy-consuming and less waste-producing. In this \r\nregard, priority is given to the adoption of taxation and financial policies \r\nin order to encourage energy conservation and increase energy efficiency. \r\nEmphasis is also placed on the protection of biological diversity. We have \r\ntaken a number of steps such as carrying out the national basic survey of the \r\nnatural ecosystem and designating natural ecosystem conservation and \r\nprotection areas. In addition, the ratification by the Republic of Korea of \r\nthe Convention on biodiversity as well as that on climate change is expected \r\nin the near future, after the necessary domestic arrangements have been \r\ncompleted. \r\nIn addition to a strong national programme, the Republic of Korea has \r\nannounced its commitment to the environmental cooperation of the North-East \r\nAsian region, which comprises the Korean Peninsula, Japan, Russia, China and \r\nMongola. We are currently working closely with our partner countries in order \r\nto formulate action programmes to tackle regional environmental problems such \r\nas marine pollution and acid precipitation. \r\nWith this in mind, the 1992 Seoul Symposium on UNCED and the Prospects of \r\nthe Environmental Regime in the Twenty-first Century was held in Seoul in \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n13-15 \r\n(Mr. Lee. Republic of Korea) \r\nSeptember this year. During the Symposium, the participants agreed to \r\nestablish an informal, unofficial network for environmental cooperation within \r\nthe North-East Asian region. Furthermore, the United Nations and the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Korea will together organize the North-East \r\nAsian Environmental Conference, which will be held in Seoul next year. \r\nI should like to conclude by re-emphasizing the importance of our \r\ndeliberations this month. Indeed, we must during our discussions find the \r\npolitical will and the foresight to institutionalize the mechanisms needed for \r\nrenewed progress in the UNCED process. The Republic of Korea is prepared to \r\nshare with others the experience gained in the process of our economic \r\ndevelopment. Each Government must endeavour to pick up where the Earth Summit \r\nleft off, and we must act on behalf of future generations that will some day \r\nthank us for having given the world a second chance. \r\nMr. NAKAMURA (Japan): It is indeed a great pleasure to have the \r\nopportunity to address the General Assembly today on the important question of \r\nhow to follow up the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development \r\n(UNCED). \r\nThe Earth Summit held in Rio, in which I was honoured to take part, was \r\nunprecedented in almost every way; the scope of the work accomplished, the \r\nlevel of participation, the extent of its impact on the public, and, most \r\nimportantly, the degree of cooperation among Governments and international \r\norganizations, among which the bodies and organizations of the United Nations \r\nsystem were most prominent. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n16 \r\n(Mr. Nakamura. Japan) \r\nThe Rio Declaration and the other epoch-making agreements on the \r\nframework of international cooperation in the field of environment and \r\ndevelopment that were concluded at the Conference mark a major step forward in \r\nour efforts to achieve sustainable development. It is increasingly clear that \r\nthe success of UNCED depends upon implementation of these accords. The road \r\nfrom Rio will be as difficult as the road to Rio was. At this session, the \r\nGeneral Assembly must make the arrangements that will enable us to follow up \r\non UNCED; it must lay the basis for United Nations involvement in the \r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 and other agreements reached at the Conference. I \r\ntherefore wish to take this occasion to address the major issues involved in \r\nthe UNCED follow-up. \r\nFirst of all, it is important that the General Assembly endorse the \r\nagreements reached at UNCED so as to confirm formally its commitment to \r\nimplementing them. Also important are the preparations for early and \r\neffective operation of both the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange and the Convention on Biological Diversity. For its part, my \r\nGovernment intends to make efforts to see that these Conventions are ratified \r\nas soon as possible. \r\nConcerning the Statement of Principles on Forests, to which my Government \r\nattaches particular importance, it would be useful to establish a process to \r\nreview its international implementation. In this connection, it is most \r\nimportant to build confidence between countries in the process of implementing \r\nthe Principles while enhancing cooperation. My Government believes that such \r\nconfidence will provide the basis for a dialogue on whatever arrangements \r\nmight be necessary in the future. To this end, my Government intends to \r\nstrengthen overseas technical and financial cooperation through various \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n17 \r\n(Mr. Nakamura, Japan) \r\nchannels for afforestation and sustainable management of forests, while \r\nenhancing sustainable management of forest resources at home. \r\nMy Government also considers it of great importance to establish an \r\nintergovernmental negotiating committee to draw up a convention that will \r\nprovide an international framework for enhanced efforts to combat \r\ndesertification, and it intends to participate actively in the work of the \r\ncommittee. \r\nInstitutional arrangements, in particular the establishment of the \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development, should be discussed vigorously at this \r\nsession of the General Ass\u0026inbly. I should like to outline my Government\u0027s \r\nbasic position on this issue. \r\nFirst of all, any proposal with regard to institutional arrangements \r\nshould aim to strengthen the role and capacity of the United Nations, \r\nincluding the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, in the \r\neconomic and social fields. Institutional arrangements should be built on and \r\nintegrated into ongoing efforts to revitalize the United Nations system. It \r\nis important to avoid duplication or overlapping of work especially when a new \r\nforum or body is created. The roles of the General Assembly and the Economic \r\nand Social Council in follov?-up activities vis-a-vis the role of the \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development should be clearly defined along the \r\nlines envisaged in Agenda 21. \r\nIn this connection, I should like to express my Government\u0027s appreciation \r\nto the Secretary-General for his report (A/47/598 and Add.l), which \r\ncomprehensively covers the important issues relating to institutional \r\narrangements and offers ini,ights and suggestions for consideration. The \r\nJapanese Government supports the major thrust of the report and is confident \r\nthat it will provide a useful basis for discussion. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n18 \r\n(Mr. Nakamura, Japan) \r\nThe high-level Commission on Sustainable Development, which has the key \r\nrole in following up on UNCED, should have broad representation among Member \r\nStates, reflecting the full diversity of the interests of industrialized and \r\ndeveloping countries, particularly those that are environmentally vulnerable, \r\nsuch as small island States. The participation of non-Member States, \r\ninternational organizations and, once an appropriate procedure is instituted, \r\nnon-governmental organizations should also should be promoted. \r\nA highly qualified and competent secretariat is likewise a prerequisite \r\nfor effective follow-up of the Conference. My Government takes note of the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s proposal, which presents some of the main considerations \r\nunderlying his approach, if not specific conclusions. The Japanese Government \r\nshares his view when he points out \r\n\"the desirability of a single streamlined structure which would provide a \r\ncommon framework for the provision of overall support to the [Economic \r\nand Social Council] on the one hand, and Secretariat follow-up to the \r\nConference on the other\" (A/47/598, para. 69). \r\nSince my Government took the initiative in proposing, during the \r\npreparatory process, the high-level advisory body which is expected to provide \r\nhigh-level expert advice to the Secretary-General to assist him in formulating \r\nproposals for the Administrative Committee on Coordination (ACC) and the \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development, we are keenly interested in this body. \r\nMy Government welcomes the Secretary-General\u0027s proposal that the advisory body \r\nshould consist of a relatively small number of eminent persons and should \r\nmaintain a balance with respect to geographical representation and fields of \r\nexpertise. \r\nAs my Government has often stated, Japan intends to support the efforts \r\nof developing and other countries in the area of environment and development. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n19-20 \r\n(Mr. Nakamura. Japan) \r\nthrough both bilateral and multilateral mechanisms. On the other hand, \r\nself-help efforts on the part of developing countries are of primary \r\nimportance to make such support truly effective. \r\nIn the implementation of Agenda 21, a useful role could be played by the \r\nInternational Development Association (IDA), which should pay due attention to \r\nthis function in negotiations on the tenth replenishment of its resources. \r\nWith regard to the Global Environment Facility (GEF), an agreement has \r\nbeen reached on the major role it is to continue to play, after necessary \r\nimprovements, concerning financial contributions in the field of the global \r\nenvironment. Appropriate funds need to be secured, once a mechanism ensuring \r\ntheir effective and efficient use is established. \r\nJapan has continuously expanded its official development assistance, \r\nsetting for itself the goal of net disbursements in excess of $50 billion for \r\nthe five-year period 1988 to 1992, which represents a 100 per cent increase \r\nover the previous five-year target. Since the urgency of preserving the world \r\nenvironment has been recognized, Japan designated its official development \r\nassistance target in 1989 for spending in the field of environmental \r\nprotection. In this connection, I should like to refer to Prime Minister \r\nMiyazawa\u0027s announcement at the Rio Conference that Japan will expand its \r\nbilateral and multilateral official development assistance in the field of the \r\nenvironment to approximately 900 billion to 1 trillion yen approximately $7 \r\nto $7.7 billion - during the five-year fiscal period that began in April 1992. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n21 \r\n(Mr. Nakamura. Japan) \r\nJapan\u0027s Official Development Assistance Charter, established in June for \r\nits official development assistance, also highlights Japan\u0027s stance of \r\nattaching great importance to the environment in its \r\nofficial-development-assistance tasks, stating the importance of environmental \r\nconservation and the compatibility of environment and development. \r\nJapan considers it important to establish partnerships with developing \r\ncountries in implementing environment-related official development \r\nassistance. Japan will do its utmost to formulate and implement projects \r\nthrough consultations with developing countries. \r\nI should like to refer to a recent development. I am pleased to inform \r\nthis body that a few days ago the International Environmental Technology \r\nCentre of the United Nations Environment Programme was formally established in \r\nOsaka and Shiga in Japan. In cooperation with the Government of Japan the \r\nCentre will carry out activities to promote the transfer of environmentally \r\nsound technologies, with special focus on the sustainable development of big \r\ncities and sound management of fresh-water resources. \r\nOur joint endeavour to protect the global environment has just begun. \r\nThe United Nations must now demonstrate that it can respond effectively to the \r\nneeds of the international community and its Member States in the field of \r\nenvironment and development. I should like to assure you, Mr. President, that \r\nmy Government will spare no effort to contribute to the success of this \r\nendeavour and to the role the United Nations will play in it. \r\nTENTATIVE PROGRAMME OF WORK \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I should like to inform members of the following \r\nadditions and changes to our tentative programme of work. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n22 \r\n(The President) \r\nAs already announced last Thursday, 29 October, the Assembly will \r\nconsider agenda item 27 after hearing an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Zambia on Tuesday, 10 November, in the morning; on Friday, \r\n12 November, the Assembly will consider agenda item 37. On Monday, \r\n23 November, the Assembly will take up agenda item 25 and agenda item 40. On \r\nTuesday, 24 November, in the morning, the Assembly will consider agenda \r\nitem 39. On Wednesday, 25 November, in the morning, the Assembly will take up \r\nagenda item 139. On the same day, the Assembly will consider agenda item 26. \r\nThe list of speakers for all those agenda items is now open. \r\nORGANIZATION OF WORK \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I should like to inform members that I have \r\nconducted extensive informal consultations during the past week with \r\nrepresentatives of the States Members of the United Nations. The subject \r\nmatter was the necessary future work of the General Assembly arising from \r\nagenda item 10, \"Report of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization\" (A/47/1), including the report of the Secretary-General entitled \r\n\"An Agenda for Peace - preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping\" \r\n(A/47/277). \r\nAs a result of those consultations, o broad consensus was reached that \r\nthe work on this agenda item should continue in an informal, open-ended \r\nworking group as well as in the Main Committees of the General Assembly. \r\nAccordingly, I am pleased now to inform the Assembly that I shall establish \r\nthis informal, open-ended working group, and that its initial task will be to \r\nanalyse all the suggestions and ideas put forward in the forum of the General \r\nAssembly during the general debate, the debate on agenda item 10, and the \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n23 \r\n(The President) \r\ninformal consultations. I shall report on the outcome of the work of the \r\ngroup, including recommendations, draft resolutions and decisions on the \r\npertinent issues by 19 December 1992. This informal, open-ended working group \r\nwill maintain close working relations with the Main Committees. My intention \r\nis that the Main Committee Chairmen be very closely associated with the work \r\nof the group. As President of the General Assembly, I shall maintain \r\npermanent and coordinated contact with the President of the Security Council \r\non General Assembly matters and on the work on agenda item 10. \r\nI have the distinct pleasure to inform the Assembly that the first \r\nmeeting of the informal open-ended working group will be held on Wednesday, \r\n4 November 1992, at 3 p.m., in Conference Room 3. All Member States \r\ninterested in attending that meeting should register with the Office of \r\nGeneral Assembly Affairs by 6 p.m. on Tuesday, 3 November 1992. I would \r\nrequest members to refer to the Journal for the schedule of the working group. \r\nAGENDA ITEM 79 (continued) \r\nREPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT \r\n(a) REPORT OF THE CONFERENCE (A/CONF.151/26, Vol. I-IV) \r\n(b) REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL (A/47/598 and Add. 1) \r\nMr. COLOSIO (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish): At the historic \r\nRio de Janeiro Conference, the international community shaped a new consensus: \r\nthat sustainable development is the new means of preserving and consolidating \r\nthe progress and coexistence of mankind. \r\nThe commitments achieved at Rio constitute the beginning of a process \r\nthat demands all our energy. It also demands the strongest political will to \r\nput into action a vast development programme that is in everyone\u0027s interests \r\nand that guarantees that our needs, those of our children and those of our \r\nchildren\u0027s children will be met. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n24-25 \r\n(Mr. Colosio. Mexico) \r\nAt Rio the community of nations, represented at the highest political \r\nlevel, opened the way to the future. Societies will not enjoy great wealth if \r\nit is generated at the expense of the environment. Peaceful coexistence will \r\nnot be assured if, for the sake of apparent progress, the balance of the Earth \r\nis put in jeopardy. \r\nIn this context, the role the United Nations should play was fully \r\nacknowledged. We must now strengthen its action by establishing mechanisms \r\nthat guarantee transparency, effectiveness, universality and democracy. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n26 \r\n(Mr. Colosio, Mexico) \r\nThe members of the Commission for Sustainable Development created by the \r\nRio Conference will examine the progress made in the implementation of \r\nAgenda 21, through periodic evaluations and action-oriented recommendations. \r\nThe process, which began in June this year, presupposes new forms of \r\ninternational cooperation that must be consistently reflected in the \r\nCommission\u0027s working methods. The idea is to combine efforts and will, not to \r\ncondemn or to punish. \r\nWe must speak out, and we must recognize that in the area of new and \r\nadditional financial resources the results achieved at Rio fell short of \r\nexpectations. The Commission for Sustainable Development gives us an \r\nopportunity to correct those shortcomings by creating a functional link \r\nbetween those resources and all other sources of financing with a view to the \r\ncomplete implementation of Agenda 21. But our achievements will be meagre \r\nunless we obtain a commitment from the wealthiest countries. In our view, \r\nnational efforts need to be clearly echoed on the international level. \r\nFor Mexicans, the priorities are clear; in 1992 we are devoting \r\n1 per cent of our gross domestic product to programmes to improve the \r\nenvironment. It is indispensable that national and international financial \r\nresources be available. It is therefore necessary that the more developed \r\ncountries honour their commitment to transfer 0.7 per cent of their gross \r\nnational product to development programmes. \r\nWe pay a tribute to the countries that, in response to the Rio \r\nagreements, have made financial pledges at this session. He appeal to all \r\nother nations with a similar commitment to follow their example. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n27 \r\n(Mr. Colosio, Mexico) \r\nDirectly related to the availability of financial resources is the \r\nquestion of the transfer of technology, which should take place on the most \r\nfavourable terms possible and should include, inter alia, timely access to \r\nscientific and technical information, the strengthening of institutional \r\ncapacity and the training of personnel. All those elements are particularly \r\nsignificant for the achievement of sustainable development. The Commission \r\nmust create machinery to follow up these efforts and encourage the transfer of \r\ntechnology in the framework of Agenda 21. \r\nDesertification is today among the most critical problems afflicting \r\nnations, irrespective of their level of development. This growing phenomenon \r\naffects an increasing number of societies, and we therefore deem it enormously \r\nimportant to begin negotiations so the international community can sign and \r\nratify an international convention to combat desertification. \r\nMexico believes also that the General Assembly should accord due \r\nimportance to agreements pertaining to the oceans and seas and to the \r\nprotection of their living resources, as well as to those pertaining to small \r\nisland States. \r\nDevelopment and environmental responsibility are inseparable principles. \r\nWe do not want to be domin?ted by a geography of guilt. We want to face our \r\nhistoric responsibility in present and future development. The sovereignty of \r\nStates depends on a just and lasting solution to development problems, \r\ncreating a favourable economic environment for the growth of nations. \r\nWe have the natural resources; what we need is the technology and the \r\nscientific know-how to ensure that our work is creative, thoughtful and \r\nfar-reaching enough to hand down to future generations effective environmental \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n28 \r\n(Mr. Colosio. Mexico) \r\nnorms. Mexico, in full exercise of its sovereignty, has the primary objective \r\nof soundly managing the environment with the participation of society as a \r\nwhole.* \r\nThe preparations for the Rio Conference inspired striking interest among \r\nbroad sectors of society, which was manifested in active and positive \r\nparticipation, mainly through non-governmental organizations. The same must \r\nbe encouraged in the process now beginning. To that end, there must be great \r\nopportunity for participation, both in monitoring the implementation of the \r\nRio agreements and in formulating recommendations that will help the \r\nCommission achieve its goals. \r\nWe in Mexico know that development based on the abuse of natural \r\nresources is not progress. We in Mexico have gone beyond a notion of \r\ndevelopment based on \"conquering\" nature. For Mexicans, development now means \r\nharmonious coexistence with nature. True development must be sustainable and \r\nmust always aim at maintaining harmony between productive activities and the \r\nprotection and enhancement of the environment. As stipulated in the Rio \r\nDeclaration, protection of the environment is an essential part of the \r\ndevelopment process. \r\n* Mr. Jesus (Cape Verde), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n29-30 \r\n(Mr. Colosio, Mexico) \r\nSimilarly, Mexico considers that among the best contributions all States \r\ncan make to the protection and enhancement of the environment is the \r\neradication of extreme poverty. He can never reach the goal of sustainable \r\ndevelopment unless we face and meet that challenge. We in Mexico are aware of \r\nthis linkage, and we have taken the institutional steps necessary to have a \r\ncomprehensive, integral impact on the various elements affecting development. \r\nThus, in May 1992, on the initative of the President of Mexico, \r\nMr. Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the Congress of the Union created the \r\nSecretariat for Social Development with the central goal of raising, in a \r\nproductive manner, the general level of well-being of the Mexican people, \r\nespecially that of the dispossessed. With an integral approach to \r\ndevelopment, the new Secretariat has responsibility for regional development, \r\nthe fight against poverty, urban development, housing and environmental \r\nprotection. In that way the Mexican Government has responded to a demand; to \r\ngive institutional form to the concept of sustainable development. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n31 \r\n(Mr. Colosio, Mexico) \r\nThe Government of Mexico is also focusing its public policy on the \r\nachievement of balanced social development. The underlying principle in this \r\npolicy is the fundamental idea of the solidarity programme, which requires \r\nactive participation by society and open, resolute joint responsibility by \r\nsociety and government in the fight against poverty and in the quest for \r\nsustainable development. \r\nOn the basis of these tenets, support has been given to social \r\ninitiatives aimed at breaking the cycle of poverty in its two fundamental \r\ndimensions: first, the lack of basic services and, second, the lack of \r\nproductive employment. Thus far, the results of that solidarity have been \r\nhighly satisfactory. \r\nAs a part of these efforts, we in Mexico have drawn up and are \r\nimplementing a programme for productive ecology. Through this productive \r\necology programme, it is our intention to alleviate the pressure exerted on \r\nnatural resources by many population centres in rural areas, because of the \r\nabsence of other development options. Hence this programme is aimed at \r\nsupporting alternate forms of production and alternate employment prospects, \r\nwhich will allow various social groups to raise their standard of living \r\nwithout doing any damage to natural resources. This is how, through a sense of \r\nsolidarity, Mexico is seeking harmony between economic development and the \r\nenvironment. \r\nMexico stresses its commitment to a present and a future of full respect \r\nfor the environment, and does so fully aware of its past, in which mankind \r\ncoexisted in full harmony with nature. In fact, the ancient inhabitants of \r\nwhat is Mexico today achieved a culture that permitted them to satisfy their \r\nneeds with complete respect for nature. Their deities water, the sun, the \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n32 \r\n(Mr. Colosio, Mexico) \r\nmountains and corn - placed both hiiman beings and resources under their mantle \r\nof protection. \r\nSubsequently, the industrial revolution in its quest to satisfy the needs \r\nof an ever-growing population encouraged unrestricted exploitation of what \r\nnature offered - a supply which was considered to be inexhaustible. It is \r\ntrue that it promoted progress and generated wealth, but at the same time it \r\njeopardized the balance of our ecosystems. \r\nToday we recognize that nature has its own limits for its regeneration \r\nand equilibrium, and we are also aware of the fact that the apparent \r\ndevelopment of the few does not ensure peaceful and stable coexistence of the \r\npeoples of the world. \r\nUntil fairly recently there was a vision of development that gave \r\npriority to quantitative over qualitative aspects a vision which encouraged \r\nthe establishment of industries in a disorderly way and the unrestricted \r\nexploitation of natural resources. Today in Mexico we have appropriate norms \r\nand we also have the possibility of access to modern technologies a \r\npossibility which is even greater today because of the future free trade \r\ntreaty between Mexico, the United States of America and Canada. \r\nHe gather our inspiration from the past, and we welcome the progress of \r\nscience and technology in order to achieve sustainable development which meets \r\nthe needs of all without endangering the lives of future generations. As has \r\nbeen pointed out by President Salinas de Gortari, we cannot defend the \r\nenvironment with a sterile economy, and with industries that evade \r\nresponsibility for protecting the environment. We want neither a sterile nor \r\na destructive economy. The vast sphere of action between these two extremes \r\nis where we in Mexico find ourselves. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n33 \r\n(Mr. Colosio. Mexico) \r\nInternational cooperation in a spirit of global solidarity aimed at \r\nachieving development and the ecological integrity of the Earth is a definite \r\nneed. The future of mankind lies in planning economic development along with \r\necological development. The human spirit is born of Mother Earth herself: \r\nprotecting the Earth means protecting our own origins and safeguarding our \r\ndestiny. Such is the spirit that drives Mexico to join the efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations to achieve sustainable development. \r\nMr. OUEDRAOGO (Burkina Faso)(interpretation from French): When we \r\nmet last June in Rio de Janeiro, it was nothing less than an encounter between \r\nmankind and the organization of its own survival. Like the rest of the \r\ninternational community, Burkina Faso expected much from this unprecedented \r\nevent, which had been prepared with such difficulty, such feverishness and \r\nsuch passion. In that respect, we salute the commitment of Mr. Maurice Strong \r\nand the devotion of the secretariat which assisted him in his colossal task. \r\nTwo facts emerged from this meeting the first confirms the indissoluble link \r\nbetween the environment and development, while the second establishes that it \r\nis the follow-up to Rio de Janeiro which will tell if we are up to dealing \r\nwith what is at stake. \r\nThe General Assembly is therefore invited today, for forty-eight hours, \r\nto clarify and agree on how the decisions taken at Rio de Janeiro should be \r\nimplemented. \r\nMy delegation welcomes the adoption and signature by most States of the \r\nConvention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity. They \r\nare but the start of a long journey which will see them ratified and \r\nimplemented, and their provisions and necessary additions respected. \r\nAlongside these Conventions, the adoption of Agenda 21 brings us, eight \r\nyears ahead of time, to the twenty-first century. The century in which we are \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n34-35 \r\n(Mr. Ouedraogo. \r\nBurkina Faso) \r\nliving now has seen the subjugation and subsequent political liberation of the \r\nmajority of mankind. And when North and South met - the former bearing its \r\ndemands, the latter its claims - the exchanges were more a matter of \r\nconfrontation than of communication. The environment and development have \r\nconvinced both North and South that ultimately we can only be saved together \r\nor perish together. The concept of a global partnership thus took shape \r\nduring the gestation and production of Agenda 21, which provides the bedrock \r\nof future relations of international cooperation. \r\nA/47/PV. 53 \r\n36 \r\n(Mr. Ouedraogo. Burkina Faso) \r\nPreliminary estimates indicate that $125 billion a year will be needed to \r\nimplement Agenda 21. A larger contribution by the developed countries is \r\nneeded to carry out all the recommendations of Agenda 21. \r\nIn this regard, we must congratulate and thank those States that, \r\nhonouring much earlier commitments, allocate 0.7 per cent of their gross \r\nnational product to official development assistance. He should also encourage \r\nthose countries that have agreed to try to reach this percentage by the year \r\n2000, and we hope that the rest will be able to join those two categories. \r\nThe recommendations of Agenda 21 will be jeopardized if new and \r\nadditional resources are not provided and if the problem of developing \r\ncountries\u0027 debt is not solved freeing those countries from a \r\nnear-insurmountable handicap especially since the trend towards a net negative \r\ntransfer of financial resources, coupled with the deterioration in the terms \r\nof exchange, undermine their efforts making all their sacrifices useless. At \r\nthe same time, ecologically rational technologies must be made available under \r\npreferential conditions, because otherwise the global partnership will be an \r\nillusory concept. \r\nThese are the facts sad but true. Hithout financial resources, without \r\ntransfers of technology and without the political will, translated into \r\naction, this programme for survival and development cannot be implemented, and \r\nour speeches will be merely incantatory. We therefore support the proposal to \r\nconvene before the end of the year a pledging conference to implement the \r\nactivities envisaged in Agenda 21. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Ouedraogo. Burkina Faso) \r\nBurkina Faso, a country hard hit by drought and desertification, was \r\npleased that the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development \r\ndecided to create a framework for negotiations on the elaboration by June 1994 \r\nof an international convention to combat desertification, particularly in \r\nAfrica. Our Minister of Environment and Tourism stated in Rio that \r\n\"desertification endangers the future of millions of people whose \r\nsurvival depends mainly on the exploitation of land\". \r\nBurkina Faso therefore had a keen interest in participating actively and \r\npositively in the negotiations on this issue, which is of prime importance to \r\nthose countries affected by desertification. \r\nHere I should like again to express our thanks to all those who \r\ncontributed to the adoption of that decision. Burkina Faso hopes that the \r\nspirit of solidarity that prevailed in Rio will continue to animate the \r\ninternational coiranunity during the negotiations leading up to the creation of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiating committee. \r\nWe hope that the convention will contain firm and specific technical and \r\nfinancial commitments, thus reinforcing in quality, intensity and volume the \r\nefforts already made nationally and subregionally over more than 10 years in \r\nthe battle against this scourge. \r\nMy delegation will participate actively and constructively in \r\nnegotiations during this forty-seventh session to create an intergovernmental \r\nnegotiating committee. He will also participate in negotiations on \r\nelaboration of the convention. \r\nIn this connection, I should like to submit the following proposals, \r\nwhich have the support of many of the States concerned. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n38 \r\n(Mr. Ouedraogo. Burkina Faso) \r\nThe intergovernmental committee, to be open to all Member States and \r\nobservers, should: hold an organizational session and five negotiating \r\nsessions; have a five-member bureau - one for each region; have an ad hoc \r\nsecretariat, led by an experienced, high-level official; and have at its \r\ndisposal, as in the case of the Convention on climate change, a group of \r\nmultidisciplinary experts. The negotiating process should be financed from \r\nthe Organization\u0027s ordinary budget and by voluntary contributions. The \r\ncommittee should report to the General Assembly through a channel to be \r\ndecided on by the Assembly. \r\nAs Ouagadougou is the headquarters of the Permanent Inter-State Committee \r\non Drought Control in the Sahel and the base for the services of the United \r\nNations Sudano-Sahelian Office, we believe that these organizations as well as \r\nthe Intergovernmental Authority for Drought and Development will have a role \r\nto play in this process. The relevant non-governmental organizations could \r\nalso help us ensure the success of this endeavour. \r\nDuring the preparatory phase the debate on the structure and management \r\nof the environment-development equation was arduous and lengthy. In Rio we \r\nfinally agreed on the principle of establishing a high-level Coinmission on \r\nSustainable Development, mandated to follow up and coordinate the decisions of \r\nthe Conference. The Commission will be the main, central intergovernmental \r\nmechanism for following up on UNCED at the national, regional and \r\ninternational levels. \r\nHe believe that the Commission should be set up under Article 68 of the \r\nCharter in order to ensure that the Conference decisions are effectively \r\nfollowed up. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n39-40 \r\n(Mr. Ouedraogo. Burkina Faso) \r\nThe Commission\u0027s tasks are to enhance international cooperation; to \r\nrationalize intergovernmental decisions on the integration of environment and \r\ndevelopment issues; and to examine the progress in the implementation of \r\nAgenda 21 at the national, regional and international levels. In carrying \r\nthem out it should be guided by the principles of the Rio Declaration for \r\nsustainable development in every country. The Commission should consist of 53 \r\nmembers elected by the Economic and Social Council for a three-year term on \r\nthe basis of equitable geographical distribution, and should be at the highest \r\npossible level. In accordance with United Nations practice. Member States and \r\nObservers could be admitted, at their request, as observers. \r\nThe Commission\u0027s follow-up and coordination functions would also cover \r\nall those listed in chapters 33, 34 and 38, including transfer of technology \r\nand relations with financial resources and mechanisms, in the light of what I \r\ndescribed earlier, including the Global Environment Fund. \r\nThe Commission on Sustainable Development should have a separate \r\nsecretariat, coming within the United Nations budget and be headed by an \r\nUnder-Secretary-General directly responsible to the Secretary-General. The \r\nsecretariat, which will have to be highly qualified and draw expertise and \r\nexperience from the UNCED preparatory process should be staffed on the basis \r\nof equitable geographical distribution. \r\nThe Commission\u0027s first session should take place in New York in 1993. In \r\n1997 it should be possible to convene a special meeting of the General \r\nAssembly to examine and evaluate the implementation of Agenda 21. We believe \r\nthat the Commission should have a mandate that is not static, but dynamic and \r\nevolutionary, so that in the future it may embrace all the aspects and tasks \r\nthat the General Assembly deems it useful to add in order to ensure \r\nsustainable development. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n41 \r\n(Mr. Ouedraogo. Burkina Faso) \r\nMy delegation has not dealt with all the aspects of Agenda 21 and all the \r\nresults of Rio, but we are convinced that the best way to approach these \r\nsubjects is always to bear in mind justice and solidarity, which we must seek \r\nto ensure in all our endeavours. \r\nSpeaking from this very rostrum of our common estate, Burkina Faso once \r\nposed the following question: \r\n\"Will the new world order be based on the universal message of the \r\nCharter or on the harsh and selective realities of the international \r\nbalance of forces? In the circumstances, what is to be the role of the \r\nhave-nots the immense multitude of people who are suffering from \r\nhunger, thirst, ignorance and disease? In a word, are these unfortunates \r\nto remain outside or are they to enter our family house so that we can \r\nall sit down together as brothers, to share and to grow together?\" \r\n(A/46/PV.4. p. 48) \r\nThe answer is in our hands. \r\nMr. NATH (India): At the outset. Sir, I would like to express my \r\ndelegation\u0027s satisfaction at seeing you chair this meeting. I would also like \r\nto take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his detailed statement introducing this agenda \r\nitem. India attaches great importance to his statement, which sets the tone \r\nfor this debate. The Permanent Representative of Malaysia, Ambassador Razali \r\nIsmail, will be carrying our deliberations through to their final outcome in \r\nthe Second Committee. He conducted similar negotiations with great aplomb and \r\nskill during the process of the United Nations Conference on Environment and \r\nDevelopment (UNCED), and I wish him good luck. He can count on the full \r\ncooperation of the Indian delegation. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Nath, India) \r\nI am speaking on behalf of a country that is neither rich nor powerful in \r\nthe conventionally understood sense of these terms, a country nevertheless \r\nthat counts one-sixth of the human race as its children and encompasses a \r\nmega-biodiversity of subcontinental dimensions, an unsurpassed range of \r\ngeo-climatic conditions and a tradition of environmental sensitivity that goes \r\nto the very roots of our millennia-old culture. \r\nThe problems of material poverty and industrial underdevelopment that \r\nplague us only serve to heighten this sensitivity to environmental \r\nconservation. More than anyone else, it is the poor who suffer most the \r\nconsequences of ecological imbalance. Shifting monsoon patterns, degraded \r\nagricultural land, denuded soil and cruel droughts are only one side of the \r\npicture; greater exposure to health hazards and susceptibility to disease \r\ncomplete it. \r\nWe in India are determined in our resolve to strive for a better quality \r\nof life for our people, and we know that the way forward is the path of \r\nsustainable development. But between the knowing and the doing lies a chasm \r\nwide and deep that can be bridged only by a great technological leap. \r\nMuch happened at Rio. The awareness and consciousness aroused by UNCED \r\nis enormous. But where do we go from here? In vain would we search for the \r\naccomplishments of Rio in the voluminous documentation that flowed from it, or \r\nin the glare and glamour of the media blitz that continue to surround it. It \r\nis only by getting to the heart of the matter and working our way outwards \r\nthat we can hope to carry out the tremendous task that we set for ourselves \r\nfive months ago, that we can hope to translate into reality the political will \r\ndemonstrated by over a hundred Heads of State or Government when they adopted \r\nthe Rio Declaration. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n43 \r\n(Mr. Hath, India) \r\nWhat is the core of the outcome of UNCED? I could summarize the chief \r\nelements as follows. \r\nFirst, environmental problems cannot be seen in isolation, and the basic \r\ndevelopment needs of developing countries must be met before environment by \r\nitself can take precedence over other concerns. \r\nSecondly, global environmental concerns largely require immediate action \r\nby the industrialized world - both corrective and preventive. Developing \r\ncountries can and will participate, provided they are given the wherewithal \r\nfor the extra effort required. \r\nThirdly, greater financial flows and the transfer of environmentally \r\nsound technology to developing countries must be ensured. \r\nFourthly, no international debate on the environment or on development \r\ncan impinge upon the sovereign right of each country over the use of its \r\nnatural resources. \r\nFifthly, for globally sustainable development, a global partnership on a \r\nbasis of equality, with equity as a prerequisite, is imperative. \r\nPost-Rio activities, at the international level in particular, must \r\ncontinue to focus on these core elements. Similarly, international \r\ninstitutions, whether exis\u0027\u0027ing or new, must structure their activities in a \r\nmanner that takes these elements into account. The implementation of the \r\nConventions, for example, must not be attempted in a manner that imposes \r\nunnecessary burdens on developing countries or seeks to regulate essential \r\neconomic activities. This would not only be unjust and against the spirit of \r\nRio, but also foolhardy and infructuous. It is necessary to take a long, hard \r\nlook at the institutions we have, our priorities - or lack of them and how \r\nthese may be modified so as to harmonize environmental policies for the common \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n44-45 \r\n(Mr. Hath. India) \r\nweal. Only by reconciling the development needs of mankind with the \r\nenvironmental compulsions that we confront can we hope to protect our planet. \r\nIn calling for the establishment of a Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, UNCED proposed an institutional mechanism to achieve it. The \r\nConference deliberately did not specify its areas of priority, just as it did \r\nnot fix priorities within Agenda 21. An institution to deal with a subject as \r\nvast as environment and development must inevitably have variable priorities \r\nvariable over time, variable over regions. What is of great importance today \r\nmay be overtaken by some other sector in a few years. What is most important \r\nto one region is very often of secondary importance to another. But \r\ncross-sectoral issues affect all of us in much the same way and are also \r\nunlikely to change in nature or dimension in just a few years. It is also \r\nwithin cross-sectoral issues that international cooperation can be most \r\nproductive, most effective and perhaps least controversial. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n46 \r\n(Mr. Hath. India) \r\nThe obvious inferencfc is that the Commission on Sustainable Development \r\nshould focus primarily on cross-sectoral issues, such as the flow of \r\nadditional resources, the modalities for transfer of technology, the \r\ndevelopment of capabilities, removal of trade imbalances, the reorientation of \r\ninternational institutions where necessary, and so on. Sectoral programmes, \r\nthrough which the Rio decisions would actually be implemented, will have to be \r\nseen in the context of these cross-sectoral concerns. For example, if a \r\ncountry wishes to accelerate the programmes related to safe drinking-water, \r\nthen the Commission should be charged with the responsibility of promoting and \r\nencouraging the necessary external assistance which is required for these \r\nprogrammes, whether it be financial resources or technology or the development \r\nof capabilities, h\\iman resources and institutions. But we would not expect \r\nthe Commission to decide on priorities within that country or to delve into \r\ninternal policy frameworks. \r\nLikewise, the review methodologies adopted should be thematic rather than \r\ncountry-specific. This woi\u0027ld help focus on the pressing problems at hand and \r\navoid tangential arguments which could dilute our efforts in a sea of \r\npolemics. The work of the proposed Commission would not be meaningful, or \r\neven acceptable, if it strayed into areas which are essentially national \r\nconcerns and are not relev̂ \u0027nt to international cooperation. We have in this \r\nregard the interesting parallel of the United nations Environment Programme, \r\nwhich has achieved its greatest success not in local or regional contexts but \r\non matters concerning the global environment.* \r\n* Mr. Elhouderi (Libyan Arab Jamahariya), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Nath. India) \r\nAgenda 21 also refers to a high-level advisory body of eminent persons \r\nworking in their individual capacity to advise the Secretary-General on issues \r\nof environment and development. I share the belief that advice from an \r\ninternational panel of eminent experts would always be of benefit to us. This \r\nbody must not reduce the flexibility which the Secretary-General should be \r\nable to enjoy in obtaining advice on various matters. Its scope should be to \r\nsupplement his efforts in drawing upon international expertise and not give \r\nrise to ambiguities in the linkages between the Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the United Nations system as a whole. \r\nFlowing from Rio is the response of the other organs of the United \r\nNations system. There is an encouraging and healthy trend in most of these \r\norganizations towards incorporating the principles of environment and \r\ndevelopment into their activities. There is still an urgent need for \r\nincremental monetary flows, but while this is happening a reorientation of \r\nsome activities can go a long way in promoting sustainable development. \r\nCrucial to the implementation of Agenda 21 is the need to mobilize additional \r\nresources for capacity-building to enable countries to meet the challenges of \r\nthe twenty-first century adequately. The United Nations Development \r\nProgramme\u0027s Capacity 21 initiative is an important instrument in achieving \r\nthis. One disturbing feature has been the desire of institutions to draft \r\npolicies and programmes in isolation from what the other organs attempt to \r\ndo. These organizations must be given some guidelines that the repeated \r\nexhortations from Rio regarding a coordinated approach must be respected. The \r\nactivities undertaken have to be harmonized with those undertaken by other \r\norganizations and iu accordance with the guidelines or framework which the \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development may formulate. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n48 \r\n(Mr. Hath, India) \r\nIndia would propose to the Commission on Sustainable Development the need \r\nto prioritize the provision of safe drinking-water to each and every human \r\nsettlement on this planet. \r\nThere is need to keep under constant review the realization of the \r\n0.7 per cent target for official development assistance, since without \r\nfinancing the implementation of Agenda 21 would be in serious doubt. We do \r\nnot ask for aid for aid\u0027s sake; financial assistance is sought so as to \r\ncatalyse our developmental effort and harmonize it with the broader \r\nenvironmental objectives we are all committed to achieving. We cannot lose \r\nsight of the fact that it is the developed countries that are chiefly \r\nresponsible for the degradation of the global environment. This is not merely \r\na historical observation. It continues to be so. The contribution of \r\n80 per cent of mankind, in Asia, in Africa, in South America, to global \r\npollution is insignificant in comparative terms. This, in effect, means that \r\nwe, by our underdevelopment and the non-utilization of our environmental \r\nspace, are actually subsidizing the high consumption patterns and lifestyles \r\nof economically developed societies lifestyles which would have been \r\nimpossible, which would have doomed the Earth a long time ago, had we Asians \r\nand Africans and Latin Americans been as profligate with our natural \r\ninheritance as developed countries have been. \r\nAppropriate technolog;. is the key with which we must unlock the resources \r\nof the Earth if we are to make any progress in achieving the goal of \r\nsustainable development. The yearning for development is so fundamental that \r\nit cannot be curbed, nor can it be held in harness to await a more conducive \r\nclimate. It will go on regardless. The onus is therefore on developed \r\ncountries to provide the n.scessary technology on affordable terms and the \r\nfunding for the development of indigenous technologies. India has time and \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n49-50 \r\n(Mr. Nath. India) \r\nagain suggested the Planet Protection Fund as a suitable mechanism by which \r\nthe transfer of technology could be realized in consonance with the spirit of \r\nRio. \r\nTwo Conventions were signed at Rio. They are somewhat different from \r\nother agreements, being legally binding instruments which will be operated by \r\nthe parties to those agreements. But in more senses than one they would \r\ninfluence and be influenced by activities undertaken as a follow-up to Rio \r\nwhether through the Commistion on Sustainable Devslopment or through other \r\norganizations. The Conventions represent an earnest effort by the global \r\ncommunity to work together towards protecting our common environment. They \r\ntogether constitute a fine balance between the recognition of national \r\nsovereignty over natural resources and the need to cooperate globally on \r\ncertain issues. The main elements of these Conventions are similar to what I \r\nhave called the core elements of the Rio agreements. If the Conventions are \r\nimplemented successfully, undoubtedly the implementation of the larger areas \r\nrepresented by Agenda 21 will gain momentum. It is therefore necessary to set \r\ninto motion as quickly as possible the process envisaged by both Conventions. \r\nIndia view these as complementary to each other; the objectives of one are \r\ninevitably reinforced by the other. \r\nThe effectiveness of international environmental conventions is certainly \r\nenhanced if they are acceded to by all countries; but we cannot lose sight of \r\nthe fact that it is to each country\u0027s advantage to accede to these \r\nConventions. Failure to dt. so does not so much detract from the value of the \r\nConventions as to jeopardize the credibility of the commitment to \r\nconservation, lending it a hollow ring. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. Nath. India) \r\nEnvironmental irresponsibility on the part of some has resulted in \r\nforests\u0027 suddenly being viewed as the only lifeline to the future. It would \r\ncertainly not be proper to regard the conservation of forests as sufficient \r\nexcuse to continue wasteful patterns of energy consumption. We in India do \r\nnot look upon our forests as mere sinks for toxic emissions; forests mean \r\nmuch, much more to us. In India forests are a community resource, with \r\nsocial, economic and cultural ramifications, and their management has to be \r\nseen in that context. The sovereign right of a country to use the natural \r\nresources within its jurisdiction, though so basic, still seems to require \r\nreassertion. Forests are an issue for global cooperation only in so far as \r\nfinancial, technical and scientific cooperation is concerned. They are not a \r\nglobal issue if this involves international regulation, which is not only \r\nunacceptable, but also unworkable. The Forestry Principles agreed upon at Rio \r\nrepresent a delicate balance between the differing interests of various groups \r\nof countries, and we should all work together to implement those Principles to \r\nthe best of our ability, enhanced by international cooperation. \r\nNever before have the nations of the world reverberated with such \r\ninterdependence. Never before has humankind had so much at stake. Never \r\nbefore have the realities been so stark. Development must be global for it to \r\nbe sustainable. Man has but one Earth, one planet, one home. We went to Rio \r\nwith great expectations and we came away with even greater hope: hope for the \r\nfuture of our planet indeed, hope for the future of mankind. \r\nGathered here in the General Assembly of the United Nations, for the \r\nfirst session since UNCED, we find that the time has come to take those \r\ninitial steps to give concrete shape to that hope. Let our steps be sure. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. Nath, India) \r\ndecisive and just, for if we falter or fail .... But we shall not; of that I \r\nam confident. \r\nMr. CHAREST (Canada): I am proud to speak on behalf of the people \r\nof Canada at this meeting of the General Assembly. We undertake a historic \r\ntask here today; to reflect on last June\u0027s United nations Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development (UNCED), otherwise known as the Earth Summit, held \r\nin Rio de Janeiro, and more importantly, to begin implementing, in concrete \r\nterms, the decisions reached there. \r\nThe Earth Summit marked a watershed in international affairs. It was \r\nheld in response to startling evidence that our planet is in trouble. And it \r\nwas held with the understanding that we cannot continue to behave as we have \r\nin the past, if we are to survive. \r\nIn Rio we committed ourselves to an urgent new course of action; a new \r\ncourse that we call sustainable development. Our deliberations here in Hew \r\nYork must demonstrate our resolve to turn the noble words of planetary healing \r\nuttered in Rio into action. \r\nFrom the earliest stages Canada was a strong supporter of the \r\nConference. We sought to play a constructive part in the advance \r\npreparations, the preliminary negotiating rounds and the actual meetings at \r\nthe Earth Summit itself. Further, we hope to continue playing a constructive \r\nrole as nations and international organizations move forward to embrace \r\nsustainable development and the products of Rio. \r\nHaving a resource-based economy, Canada recognizes the challenges of \r\nsustainable development. We also feel the pressures of modern industrialized \r\nsociety. Perhaps this is why we are concerned that a way be found to build \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Charest. Canada) \r\nbridges and partnerships between rich and poor. North and South, East and West. \r\nWe believe that a better, more effective dialogue among leaders is the \r\nonly way to build understanding, trust and commitment to common action the \r\nvery necessary foundation for an environmentally sustainable world, \r\n(spoke in French) \r\nAs I have already said, Canada sought to play a constructive part in the \r\npreparations for the Conference, the preliminary negotiating rounds and the \r\nactual meetings at the Summit itself. \r\nWe were able to do so because we were well prepared. We had played an \r\nactive part in the World Commission on Environment and Development. We had \r\nresponded to the Commission\u0027s 1987 report by setting up a National Task Force \r\nand national, provincial and territorial round tables on the environment and \r\nthe economy. And we had heeded the message of the Commission\u0027s report by \r\nadopting sustainable development as the main goal of our Green Plan, the \r\nnational strategy that Canada launched in 1990. \r\nDeveloping our Green Plan taught us valuable lessons, which we were able \r\nto apply in Rio. It became clear to us that to implement sustainable \r\ndevelopment three factors are vital: transparency, accountability and \r\ninclusiveness. First, decision-making must be transparent; the process must \r\nbe accessible to the people who will be affected by the decisions. Secondly, \r\nall sectors of society must be accountable for their actions, or their \r\ninaction; they must all give specific commitments by which their performance \r\ncan be judged. Thirdly, sustainable development demands partnership, with \r\neveryone taking part in a common effort. There is a place for everyone at the \r\ntable of sustainable development; no one can be left out if we are to succeed. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n54-55 \r\n(Mr. Charest. Canada) \r\nThis is the way to ensure a healthy environment and a prosperous economy \r\nfor present and future generations. \r\nWe were pleased that this was the approach adopted for the Earth \r\nSummit. In fact, transparency, accountability and inclusiveness are now being \r\ncalled the \"Rio Way\". That is an accomplishment as great as the other \r\nachievements of UNCED, because making the shift to sustainable development \r\nrequires not simply money or new programmes, but a change in attitude and \r\nabove all in the decision-making process. \r\nIndeed, Rio has already changed Canadians. The perceptions that affect \r\nbehaviour have been profoundly altered. Fully two thirds of Canadians three \r\ntimes the pre-UHCED number recognize the need for international cooperation \r\non important environmental issues, \r\n(spoke in English) \r\nOne essential change will involve our institutions. Canada strongly \r\nsupported the creation of a Commission on Sustainable Development at the Earth \r\nSummit. We welcome the report of the Secretary-General on how to achieve that \r\ngoal. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n56 \r\n(Mr. Charest, Canada) \r\nWe would like to see a high-level commission set up as soon as possible. \r\nThis body will promote the implementation of Agenda 21 internationally; more \r\ngenerally, it will serve as a catalyst for sustainable development within the \r\nUnited nations system. To be effective, it is crucial that the commission \r\nretain strong links with the United nations development system. He believe \r\nthat this commission should incorporate the principles of what we call in \r\nCanada the \"Rio way\": transparency, accountability and inclusiveness. To \r\nthis end, it should provide for the active participation of non-government \r\norganizations and other major groups, a principle on which Canada will \r\ncontinue to insist. As a first step to demonstrate Canada\u0027s commitment to the \r\nbenefits of the Rio way, I am proud that Canada\u0027s delegation to the United \r\nNations debate on UNCED follow-up today will include representatives of \r\nnon-government organizations. \r\nFinally, to be effective the commission must be realistic. Its work plan \r\nmust be pragmatic, flexible and achievable. It should also proceed in a \r\nspirit not of confrontation but of cooperation and mutual support. That is \r\nthe way to achieve tangible and significant results. \r\nOn behalf of Canada, I thank the Secretary-General for his thoughtful \r\nreport on institutional follow-up, which provides a useful basis for our \r\ndeliberations. The report underlines the importance of integrating \r\nenvironmental considerations into economic and social decision-making, in \r\norder to move the world towards sustainable development. Rio was a success in \r\nproviding a framework for this goal: Agenda 21, the Rio Declaration and the \r\nforest principles offer a comprehensive blueprint for action. For Canada, the \r\nkey issue is that the commission must be capable of ensuring the \r\nimplementation of this ambitious blueprint at the national, regional and \r\ninternational levels. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Charest. Canada) \r\nOf course, the Commission on Sustainable Development is only one part of \r\nthe picture. Sustainable development themes and programmes will have to be \r\nintegrated into the entire United Nations system with the help of a reformed \r\nand effective Economic and Social Council. \r\nSpecifically, on environmental aspects of sustainable development, for 20 \r\nyears the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has played a notable \r\npart in this field. Canada has strongly supported UNEP since its creation, \r\nand we continue to do so. Over the years, the Programme, under the leadership \r\nof Dr. Tolba, has carried out a very broad and difficult mandate. It is to be \r\ncommended for its efforts and for its many successes. Canada looks to an \r\nenhanced role for UNEP in the future, and to a strengthening of its capacity \r\nto undertake its mandate. I believe that UNEP will play an even more \r\nimportant role in the years to come by enhancing its efforts in such \r\nprogrammes as its environmental assessment, the EARTHWATCH Programme, and in \r\nthe development of legal instruments to address environmental threats shared \r\nby many nations. All Member States must renew, and where possible augment, \r\ntheir commitments to UNEP, both tangible and intangible, in order to give it \r\nthe strong support it deserves. I believe that UNEP has reached full \r\nmaturity, and is ready to meet the challenges ahead. At the Earth Summit, \r\nPrime Minister Mulroney announced that Canada will double its contribution to \r\nUNEP. That increase clearly indicates our confidence in the United Nations \r\nEnvironment Programme. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\nWhen attending the Earth Summit, Canada\u0027s Prime Minister proposed five \r\ncrucial steps to capitalize fully on the momentum of the summit. These steps \r\nconstitute for us in Canada a framework for environmental cooperation. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr. Charest. Canada) \r\nMr. Mulroney called on all countries to translate into action and coordinate \r\ntheir commitment to sustainable development through national \"green\" plans. \r\nHe accepted an invitation from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \r\nto share with other nations Canada\u0027s experience in this area. In this regard, \r\nCanada has been pleased to commit Can$ 2 million to UHDP\u0027s new Capacity 21 \r\nprogramme, which has been established to help developing countries build up \r\ntheir desired capacities in the area of management of the environment and \r\nsustainable development. Secondly, the Prime Minister called urgently for the \r\nexpeditious signing, ratification and implementation of the Conventions on \r\nbiodiversity and climate change, and gave an assurance that Canada would \r\nratify these agreements before the end of 1992. \r\nThirdly, he called on the developed countries to act on aid, trade and \r\ndebt in order to help the developing nations make the transition to \r\nsustainable development. With regard to aid, he noted that Canada supported \r\nthe Global Environmental Facility, pledging that Canada would contribute its \r\nfair share. On trade, he proposed that the next round of General Agreement on \r\nTariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations focus on environment issues. And on \r\ndebt, he announced that Canada had reached agreement with various countries in \r\nLatin America to convert up to Can$ 145 million of official development \r\nassistance debt in Latin America into sustainable development projects. \r\nFourthly, Mr. Mulrone/ addressed the question of international \r\ninstitutional machinery. He called for action by the General Assembly to set \r\nup a Commission on Sustainable Development. He also undertook to broaden the \r\nterms of reference of Canada\u0027s International Development Research Centre to \r\ninclude sustainable development, and provide for United Nations involvement in \r\nthis institution. Over the next 10 years, the Canadian International \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n59 \r\n(Mr. Charest, Canada) \r\nDevelopment Research Centre will be required to manage Can$ 1 billion \r\nallocated to building up research and technological capacity in developing \r\ncountries. \r\nFifthly, the Prime Minister proposed a renewed effort to draft an Earth \r\nCharter, fixing 1995 as the target date for its completion, to coincide with \r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United nations General Assembly. In addition, \r\nMr. Mulroney called for immediate follow-up to UNCED\u0027s achievements on forests \r\nand fishing, \r\n(spoke in English) \r\nThe consensus we reached on the Statement of Principles on the \r\nManagement, Conservation and Sustainable Development of Forests was hard won, \r\nas I know from my own involvement in the negotiations. That statement stands \r\nas the first international acknowledgement of the need to act together to \r\npreserve the world\u0027s forests. It is critical that we move on two fronts. \r\nFirst, nations must do their utmost to implement the guiding principles \r\ndomestically; and, secondly, we must strengthen international dialogue on \r\nforests, principally through the Commission on Sustainable Development as the \r\nforum for monitoring UNCED follow-up, and also through the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Tropical Timber \r\nOrganization (ITTO). This is a priority for Canada, and we are taking \r\nimmediate steps. Our National Forest Strategy - Canada\u0027s sustainable forestry \r\naction plan will be adjusted to fulfil the guiding principles on forests. \r\nOur domestic model forest programme will create a network of 10 model forests \r\nacross Canada, with the involvement of government, business, non-governmental \r\norganizations, community organizations and indigenous people. In Rio, \r\nMr. Mulroney announced the international counterpart of this initiative. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n60 \r\n(Mr. Charest, Canada) \r\nCanada will support the establishment of model forests in three developing \r\ncountries. Our goal is to build a global network of sustainable forestry in \r\naction. The international model forests programme is one example of how \r\nnations can work together to give meaning to the concept of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\nCanada\u0027s Prime Minister also called for action on the issue of \r\noverfishing on the high seas something of vital concern to thousands of \r\nfishermen in Canada\u0027s Atlantic provinces. These Canadians have seen a drastic \r\ndecline in all fish stocks most notably the northern cod, a resource of \r\nonce-legendary richness exploited for 400 years by North Americans and \r\nEuropeans, and more recently by distant-water fishing fleets from Asia as \r\nwell. How that resource is in danger of being lost forever. The economic and \r\nsocial effects of this precipitous decline in stocks on the fishing \r\ncommunities in Atlantic Canada have been catastrophic. Further, the impact is \r\nbeing felt around the world. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n61 \r\n(Mr. Charest, Canada) \r\nOne of the principal reasons for the sharp decline in fish stocks on the \r\nGrand Banks of Hewfoundland is the indiscriminate overfishing on the high seas \r\nbeyond Canada\u0027s 200-mile limit. And the same overfishing can be seen on many \r\nof the world\u0027s major fishing grounds. The only way in which the international \r\ncommunity can avert a calamity in high-seas fishing is through international \r\ncooperation by establishing rules to which all fishing nations will adhere. \r\nUNCED\u0027s Agenda 21 calls for the convening, as soon as possible, of an \r\nintergovernmental conference under United nations auspices with a view to \r\nimplementing the provisions of the United nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea that relate to straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. \r\nCanada strongly endorses such a step and is working with like-minded States at \r\nthis session of the General Assembly on a draft resolution calling for the \r\nconvening of a conference on high-seas fisheries, to begin work in the spring \r\nof 1993. The goal that we seek to achieve through this conference, on behalf \r\nof the fishermen of the world, is the creation of a high-seas fishing regime \r\nthat will result in sustainable development for all. \r\nWe must be prompt in our efforts to respond to this crisis. Time, tide \r\nand declining fish stocks will wait for no one. We must therefore set a \r\ndeadline of two years from now for the United Nations high-seas fishery \r\nconference to complete its work. To delay any longer would ensure the \r\ndevastation of both the coastal fisheries and the high-seas fisheries which \r\nare interdependent - the world over. \r\nThis will be one of the first tests of the Rio spirit. We are convinced \r\nthat, with good will on all sides, the outcome will be successful. Action in \r\nall these areas will do much to further the cause of sustainable development. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Charest. Canada) \r\n(spoke in French) \r\nWe must also continue the discussions between North and South that began \r\nin Rio. The Earth Svimmit was important because it bound together the concepts \r\nof environment and of development. Rio reminded us that poverty forces people \r\nto plunder their environment and draws them into ever greater poverty. It is \r\nan unsustainable cycle that we in the developed world must help to stop. \r\nFrom the Rio experience we learned that we can find solutions but only \r\nif we understand each other\u0027s points of view. Naturally, dialogue can be \r\ndifficult, as different nations face very different problems. But Rio showed \r\nnot just that we can find solutions but that we must do so. Canada has a \r\nproud tradition of fostering dialogue that leads to innovation and creative \r\nsolutions. It is a tradition that we intend continuing. \r\nCanada is committed to achieving sustainable development in partnership \r\nwith the third-world countries. The Canadian International Development \r\nAgency\u0027s policy on environmentally sustainable development lays the groundwork \r\nfor this partnership. Among others, an important task before us this month \r\nwill be the launching of the process for drawing up an international \r\nconvention to combat desertification, \r\n(spoke in English) \r\nThe deliberations that are beginning at the United Nations today signal \r\nthe start of the integration of the results of Rio into the way we do business \r\nbetween nations. In Canada, we have taken the first steps. We are proceeding \r\nwith ratification of the Conventions on climate change and biodiversity, and \r\nwe shall produce the national plans that are called for. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. Charest. Canada) \r\nIn August we successfully completed negotiations with the United States \r\nand Mexico on a new North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This is the \r\nfirst major international trade agreement to include a commitment to \r\nsustainable development, as well as specific environmental-protection clauses. \r\nFurther, the three NAFTA countries have agreed in principle to establish a \r\nNorth American commission on the environment. \r\nIn addition, this week a meeting of Canadians from across our country \r\nwill discuss how we shall build on the achievements of Rio. At the meeting, \r\nthere will be representatives of all sectors of our society including \r\nbusiness, labour, women, youth, native peoples and environmental and \r\ndevelopmental organizations. We are thus continuing the inclusive approach \r\nthat we adopted for the Earth Summit. This time our aim will be to reach \r\nconsensus and to promote action by all sectors to fulfil our Rio commitments \r\neach sector accepting its share of responsibilities. \r\nWe believe that strong domestic action is essential, because sustainable \r\ndevelopment must be addressed at every level. But there is another reason: no \r\ncountry will do more for the citizens of another country than it will do for \r\nits own. Domestic action provides a sound basis for equally necessary \r\ninternational initiatives. Canada thus feels able to make a positive \r\ncontribution to the discussions at this session. \r\nThe list of issues that we must address is long and pressing. To assist \r\nus, however, we have the strong direction given by the Earth Summit. In \r\nparticular, we know that qiestions of environment and development can no \r\nlonger be dealt with in isolation, since each depends on the other. We know \r\nalso that we must integrate concerns of North and of South, of developed and \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n64 \r\n(Mr. Charest. Canada) \r\nof developing nations. And we must foster the participation of all sectors of \r\nour societies in achieving the solutions that we seek. In short, we must \r\npractise transparency, accountability and inclusiveness the Rio way at all \r\nlevels. \r\nThe Earth Summit established new standards by which to measure our \r\ndomestic and international actions on environment and development. Those \r\nstandards could be crucial in the coming years. Now we face the challenge of \r\nliving up to them. And there is no better place to start than here, at this \r\nmeeting. \r\nMs. PIETIKAINEN (Finland): The United Nations Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development is a milestone in the evolution of the United \r\nNations system which was born in San Francisco 47 years ago to regulate \r\ninternational relations. The Rio Earth Summit of last June represents an \r\nimportant step in a process to prevent a fatal confrontation between hiimankind \r\nand the environment - a conflict that could totally endanger life on earth. \r\nThe Earth Summit pledged a commitment to sustainable growth, poverty \r\nreduction and environment protection. This pledge is based on a profound \r\nunderstanding of the close relationship between environment and development. \r\nMan is not superior to nature. Without proper respect for the support \r\ncapacity of the Earth we can have no prospect of a healthy environment or of \r\neconomic growth. A new, more rational use of natural resources can show us a \r\nnew path to a sustainable economy. \r\nThose conclusions were shared at the highest political level. The widest \r\ncommitment ever achieved was made to the attainment of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. This commitment was based on shared responsibility and a new \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n65 \r\n(Ms. Pietikainen. Finland) \r\npartnership. Today there must be no doubt about our resolve to fulfil our Rio \r\ncommitments. \r\nAt this session of the General Assembly we must embark on the long road \r\ntowards turning these commitments into reality. Agreements or programmes will \r\nmake no change if they are not implemented. The way in which we turn the Rio \r\nDeclaration into action and implement Agenda 21, the Forest Principles and the \r\ntwo Conventions will be decisive. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n66 \r\n(Ms. Pietikainen. Finland) \r\nThe United Nations specialized agencies and other international \r\norganizations and financing institutions have an important role to play in \r\nimplementing Agenda 21. The Agenda provides a long-term framework and \r\nguidance for priorities in the work programmes of the international agencies. \r\nIt is crucial that the Assembly urge and impel the whole United Nations system \r\nto begin the effective implementation of Agenda 21. \r\nGovernments too have a responsibility in launching the international \r\ncooperation agreed at Rio. Since our decisions were taken at the highest \r\npolitical level, our Governments must consequently also stand ready to take \r\naction in a coordinated manner in the decision-making bodies of the \r\nspecialized agencies and other organs of the United Nations system. \r\nThe Government of Finland welcomes the agreement on the establishment of \r\nthe high-level Commission on Sustainable Development. We would like to \r\nemphasize the importance of its role in providing a forum for political debate \r\nand policy guidance on major issues of sustainable development in implementing \r\nthe Rio decisions as well as integrating environment and development \r\nthroughout the United Nations system. The monitoring of the provision of new \r\nand additional financial resources for Agenda 21 from all sources will be \r\nequally important. \r\nThe Assembly should decide on the organizational modalities of the \r\nCommission. The institutional arrangements should be closely linked with the \r\noverall reform of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations. This \r\nreform is already\" under way and will, we hope, lead to a more effective \r\nEconomic and Social Council. \r\nWe consider that the size of the Commission should strike a balance \r\nbetween efficiency and representativity. While membership must be limited to \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n67 \r\n(Ms. Pietikainen. Finland) \r\nGovernments, the Commission should enhance the participation of and dialogue \r\nwith non-governmental organizations and the scientific and private sectors as \r\nwell as with financing institutions. The contribution of those sectors was a \r\nsource of encouragement during the UNCED preparatory process, and it should \r\ntherefore be further pursued. \r\nThe functions of the Commission, in particular its policy guidance, \r\nrequire a careful consideration of the organization of its work and the \r\ndevelopment of its working methods. We think it important that the Commission \r\nshould not limit itself solely to reviewing the progress achieved in \r\nimplementing the results of Rio, but that it should, rather, assume a dynamic \r\nrole in identifying the priorities and emerging issues related to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. I am pleased to see that the Secretary-General in his report \r\nalso emphasizes this approach. \r\nThe possibilities of arranging ministerial debates of the Commission, \r\ncoordinated with the high-level segment of the Economic and Social Council, \r\nshould be studied in order to avoid repetition and overlapping. \r\nWithout the support of a strong and competent secretariat, the high-level \r\nCommission will remain a talk shop. The central role of the Commission in \r\npolicy-making would in our view speak in favour of the secretariat\u0027s being \r\nlocated at Headquarters in Hew York. This would permit it to work in close \r\ncollaboration with the Department of Economic and Social Development and thus \r\nlead to a reinforcement of both units. \r\nSince it is the prerogative of the Secretary-General to make the \r\nnecessary administrative arrangements in this regard, I shall not dwell in \r\nmore detail on this question, but only add that the head of the Commission \r\nsecretariat must be given the status and means to allow him or her to act as \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n68 \r\n(Ms. Pietikainen, Finland) \r\nthe top coordinator of sustainable development in the entire United Nations \r\nsystem. \r\nThe results of the Earth Summit encouraged the larger reform process by \r\nunderlining the unique and indispensable role of the United Nations in \r\npromoting sustainable development. I would strongly encourage the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to integrate the environmental considerations in the reform process in \r\na manner indicated by UNCED. We must set our ambitions high. Sustainable \r\ndevelopment must be an integral part of the mission of the United Nations to \r\npromote prosperity and justice and be closely linked to the political \r\nfunctions of maintaining peace and security in the world. I was very pleased \r\nto note that the Secretary-General in his very important statement this \r\nmorning expressed views on the reform process that correspond very much with \r\nthose of my Government. \r\nThe United Nations Environment Programme (UHEP) should continue to play a \r\ndecisive role in stimulating and coordinating the environmental activities of \r\nthe United Nations system. Therefore, UNEP\u0027s role and capacity should be \r\nstrengthened to meet those functions foreseen for it in Agenda 21. \r\nEnvironmental monitoring and impact assessment, dissemination of environmental \r\ninformation, further development of international environmental law and its \r\nimplementation, as well as providing expert advice to developing countries in \r\ntheir capacity-building, will be most important. \r\nThe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), like UHEP, has a crucial \r\nrole in the UHCED follow-up. It has in particular a central role in \r\norganizing the United nations system\u0027s support for building the capacity for \r\nsustainable development in developing countries. This important task must be \r\nfully taken into account in the preparations of the Sixth Programme Cycle of \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n69-70 \r\n(Ms. Pietikainen. Finland) \r\nthe UHDP. Implementation of Agenda 21, and in particular capacity building \r\nfor sustainable development, should not be seen as a separate but as an \r\nintegral part of the functions of UHDP. \r\nThe sustainable management, conservation and development of forests will \r\nbe a cornerstone in strengthening economic, ecological and social well-being \r\nin most countries. The adoption of the forest principles is a significant \r\nstep in global cooperation in the sustainable development of the forest \r\nresources of the world. \r\nOur next task is to prepare national programmes and other related \r\nmeasures to implement these principles. It is very encouraging that several \r\nGovernments have announced that they have already undertaken to prepare such \r\nprogrammes. These programmes should be based on sovereignty and on \r\nresponsibility in using forest resources and take into account the differences \r\nin local conditions. The economic benefit from sustainable forest management \r\nbelongs to the local population. \r\nThe implementation and monitoring of the forest principles will lead to \r\nsignificantly improved international cooperation. It will increase mutual \r\nconfidence and make it possible to launch a process of negotiating a global \r\nforest instrument based on the principles agreed at Rio. \r\nThe preparation of a convention that encompasses the various functions of \r\nforests should be in the long-term interest of all countries. The Conventions \r\non Climate Change and on Biological Diversity cover only some functions of \r\nforests. The launching of negotiations on desertification will include one \r\nmore important aspect. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n71 \r\n(Ms. Pietikainen, Finland) \r\nYet these Conventions emphasize mainly the conservation of forests. \r\nThere is a good case for considering all functions and purposes. It is \r\nequally important to cover social and economic aspects under one regime in a \r\nbalanced manner. \r\nPromotion of the sustainable multiple use of natural forests must be the \r\nreal focus of the future forest convention. It should strengthen such \r\nmanagement of forest resources as will allow all countries to halt the \r\ndecrease of forest resources and at the same time meet their economic and \r\nsocial needs. \r\nWe are ready actively to support the process leading to the forest \r\nconvention negotiations. New and additional financial resources are needed to \r\nenable developing countries to prepare and implement forestry programmes. The \r\nGovernment of Finland stands ready to support financially programmes and \r\nprojects on reforestation and training in developing countries. \r\nThe second Pan-European Ministerial Forestry Conference will be held in \r\nHelsinki next June. That Conference can serve to strengthen the commitment of \r\nEuropean Governments to turn the forest principles into reality and pave the \r\nway for intensified cooperation with developing countries. \r\nThe main emphasis in implementing Agenda 21 should be at the national \r\nlevel. International cooperation will have the role of supporting and \r\ncoordinating national measures as well as steering them in the right \r\ndirection. Making development sustainable must be the responsibility of each \r\nsector and each level of public authorities. The input of non-governmental \r\norganizations, industry, labour unions and the scientific community is \r\nindispensable in this work. This will require political leadership and \r\ncoordination both nationally and internationally. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n72 \r\n(Ms. Pietikainen. Finland) \r\nThe Government of Finland is in the process of organizing its own \r\nfollow-up work to UNCED, which will be based on broad representation of \r\nexpertise and interests in the Finnish society. In Finland, integrating \r\nenvironment and development in decision-making is our long-term objective. \r\nEconomic instruments and environmental impact assessments are being developed \r\nfor this purpose. Encouraging and promoting changes in production and \r\nconsumption patterns, including the promotion of energy saving and the \r\ndevelopment of new and renewable energy sources, are high on our agenda. \r\nEfficient implementation of the Conventions on biological diversity and \r\nclimate change is also one of our priorities. He are preparing for the early \r\nratification of these two Conventions and urge other Governments to do so as \r\nwell. \r\nIt is most important that the Commission for sustainable development \r\nencourage the exchange of information and experience on national measures \r\nearly in its work. The preparation of guide-lines for reporting and for \r\ninformation exchange will be our first priority in the practical work of the \r\nCommission. He are ready to share our own experience with other countries in \r\npreparing the domestic Agenda 21 and national programmes for implementation of \r\nthe Conventions. \r\nThe essence of the Rio spirit is partnership and shared responsibility. \r\nThe main responsibility for national sustainable development will rest with \r\nthe Governments. They agreed at the highest political level that substantial \r\nnew and additional funding for the implementation of Agenda 21 is required. \r\nFor developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, official \r\ndevelopment assistance is the main source of external funding. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n73 \r\n(Ms. Pietikainen, Finland) \r\nI would like to recall that during the preparatory process of UNCED the \r\nHordic countries proposed that donor countries agree to reach the 0.7 target \r\nfor official development assistance by the year 2000. In spite of our present \r\nbudgetary constraints we are committed to this. The alleviation of poverty, \r\nprotection of the environment, strengthening of the role of women, support for \r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights will be the focus of our development \r\ncooperation strategy. \r\nToday we face the serious danger that the national and international \r\neconomic crisis will impair our vision and lead to short-sighted solutions. \r\nIt is dangerous to underestimate the difficulties in finding political support \r\nand understanding for the interrelationship between long-term global and \r\nnational benefits. In such a situation the goals of domestic sustainable \r\ndevelopment also seem remote and are easily put aside. \r\nWe owe it to future generations to face and respond to the challenges of \r\nour Rio commitments. Even though the path to sustainable development would \r\nseem to go uphill, we have a good road map in Agenda 21 and the other \r\ndecisions made at Rio. As the road is long, it is important that the goal be \r\nclear in our minds and that we check the direction from time to time. Finland \r\nsupports the holding of a special session of the General Assembly for an \r\noverall review of the UNCED decisions and their implementation not later than \r\n1997. \r\nWe are prepared to shoulder our common responsibility in attaining the \r\ngoals we collectively set at Rio. Finland stands ready fully to meet its \r\ncommitments. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n74-75 \r\nMr. SERRATE-CUELLAR (Bolivia) (interpretation from Spanish): It is \r\nfrom this eminent universal forum that great changes are expected changes \r\nconsistent with the new times upon which humankind has embarked. A historian \r\nwho in the future looks back upon the present century will surely emphasize \r\nthe events of the last decade. \r\nIt is precisely at this session that the United Nations can lay the \r\nfoundations for a higher dimension of human life in society or lead the world \r\ndown the road of doubt and discouragement. \r\nThe challenge of the moment is that simple and that impressive. This \r\nOrganization may never have another chance like this to choose between change \r\nin keeping with new realities or missing the train of history. \r\nIn these times in which we live, there is already a growing consciousness \r\nthat we are all part of a global community. Five hundred years after \r\nColumbus, we have rediscovered our planet, finding that it is a single \r\ninterdependent entity in which the manner of life of some affects the destiny \r\nof all. \r\nIn this modern or, if one prefers, post-modern era the ideals of \r\nliberty which have come down to us from the French Revolution have gained in \r\nstrength, but the principles of equality and fraternity continue to be left \r\nbehind. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n76 \r\n(Mr. Serrate Cuellar, Bolivia) \r\nNever before has democracy, as a value and a tangible reality, taken hold \r\nin every continent. Human rights, recognized as a universal principle, are \r\nplaying an increasingly vital role. The risks of global confrontation have \r\nvirtually disappeared, and the world\u0027s new security has become decentralized. \r\nKeeping the peace has become more a matter of foresight than a matter of \r\nremedies. However, the main sources of insecurity are still with us. \r\nPoverty, drugs and destruction of the environment continue to pose individual \r\nand collective threats of human tragedy and social malaise. These are the new \r\nhorsemen of the apocalypse, the great common challenge that science has not \r\nbeen able to overcome perhaps because in our frenzied race for progress we \r\nhave tended to forget that it is man as such who should always have been the \r\nfocus of all organized endeavour. \r\nBipolar strategies have given way to a tripolar economy with a new style \r\nof competition, one which brings together a group of seven at the exclusive \r\nbanquet table of development. The process that broke down iron curtains has \r\ngone hand in hand with an individualism that is now digging a protective moat \r\naround accumulated wealth, centralizing resources and raising new barriers \r\naround its expanded spaces even as it topples the old walls of nationalism. \r\nWindows to integration have been opened but, at the same time, doors to \r\ntrade have been shut as a result of the re-emergence of protectionism and the \r\nsubsidizing of local interests or constituencies. Multilateral financial \r\nfacilities and tariff agreements, while becoming a worldwide trend, continue \r\nto act as a funnel with a wide opening for some and a narrow opening for \r\nothers, and the most stringent rules always applying to the most powerless. \r\nMoreover, technology even as it becomes the contemporary hallmark of \r\nthe development of productive forces - has at the same time become the major \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n77 \r\n(Mr. Serrate Cuellar. Bolivia) \r\nfeature differentiating levels of development among our countries. And it is \r\nnot only advanced technology that has become the privilege of the few, but \r\nalso the technology designed to meet basic hvunan needs. Knowledge has brought \r\nus closer together, but technological growth is separating us. \r\nThe gaps widening between us are becoming increasingly unjust. The rich \r\nare growing richer and the poor of the world, ever more numerous, are growing \r\npoorer. The disparity in income between rich and poor three decades ago was \r\n30 to 1. That gap has doubled and now stands at 60 to 1. The gap widens to \r\n150 to 1 if we compare the incomes of the world\u0027s richest quintile with those \r\nof the most marginalized quintile. And the trend continues in the same \r\ndirection, nationally and internationally, against a backdrop in which \r\ncommunications are enhancing expectations. \r\nWe now have a better understanding of each other\u0027s realities and we are \r\nable to understand each other more clearly, without prejudices or ideological \r\ndogmatism. The truth is that, although political walls have fallen, social \r\nchasms have widened. And just as the differences between us are clear, it is \r\nequally clear that we have over time replaced the culture of force with the \r\nforce of culture, pursuing common goals that can only take shape around a \r\nrecognition of the specificity and interests of each nation. \r\nThis is not a time for confrontation, but a time to build bridges. \r\nPolitical bridges are already going up, and we must lay economic and \r\norganizational foundations and, above all, underpin them with bonds of \r\ncooperation. \r\nElectronic media and modern means of transport have shrunk both physical \r\nand mental distances. The concept of neighbourhood now encompasses the whole \r\nplanet, and the geo-economics of interrelatedness overshadows direct contacts \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n78 \r\n(Mr. Serrate Cuellar. Bolivia) \r\nor shared borders. Against that background, new paradigms are beginning to \r\ntake shape. Reality is leading us to convergent approaches with which to face \r\nglobal crises. The idea of democratizing democracy is gaining ground, \r\nreaching deeper levels of citizen participation in national and international \r\naffairs. At the same time, knowledge is advancing in the contributions it can \r\nmake to the search for social equity. Work is forging ahead also in the area \r\nof human development, understood as a synthesis of collective action. But the \r\ngreat epistemological breakthrough occurred with the global consciousness \r\nreached in Rio de Janeiro, at a summit that was initially perceived as \r\nenvironmental but which finally focused on justice and development. \r\nAt Rio we acknowledged that unbridled techno-industrialization was \r\nleading us to self-destruction and was gradually losing any semblance of \r\nprogress, with luxurious, wasteful and destructive patterns of consumption on \r\nthe one hand and increasing extreme poverty on the other, showing the clear \r\nincoherence of present models of development. Over-exploitation of raw \r\nmaterials, urban pollution, global warming, ozone depletion, crops that \r\ncontribute to desertification, the threat to nature and the fear of collapse \r\nled us inescapably to the conclusion that there was a limit to this process, \r\nthat we could not continue treating our planet as if it were a temporary camp \r\nthat could be continually moved as resources were exhausted. \r\nIn Rio we agreed to ensure the durability, permanence or sustainability \r\nof life. We agreed to reconcile our ways with the Earth and with each other. \r\nWe affirmed our common conviction of the need to meet the reguirements of the \r\npresent and undertook to be stewards of the Earth for future generations. \r\nThus emerged, with force and consensus, the concept of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, the principles of the Rio Declaration and the commendable work of \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n79-80 \r\n(Mr. Serrate Cuellar. Bolivia) \r\nAgenda 21, a true programme of action for nations as they set a course into \r\nthe next century. \r\nOn that occasion, the President of Bolivia stressed and warned that this \r\nvaluable instrument should not be turned into one more exercise in \r\ninternational hypocrisy. Today, we fear that the road from Rio to New York \r\nhas been too long, that we have exhausted ourselves along the way, that the \r\nvoices of the world have grown weaker, that the pages of the Rio Declaration \r\nmay fall with this autumn\u0027s leaves, and that the great challenge of the \r\ncentury may prove to be only a faint flicker. \r\nWe must not forget the overwhelming historical reasons that led us to \r\nadopt Agenda 21. Within its 40 chapters and more than 100 programmes it \r\nencompasses the most comprehensive framework for decision-making and action \r\nthat the international community has ever conceived. It addresses aspects of \r\nfundamental concern to the environment and development, ranging from trade to \r\ninternational investment, poverty, debt, the fight against pollution, health \r\nand technology, education and population, protection of mountain ecosystems \r\nand forests, islands surrounded by rising waters, land-locked countries, lack \r\nof soil fertility and lack of human opportunity. \r\nNever before has the world seen an instrument so complete and supported \r\nby such consensus. Formerly, plans took shape by sectors or by blocs. \r\nAgenda 21 includes features of both national and international endeavour, the \r\nneed for participation by young people, women and indigenous peoples, \r\nentrepreneurs, farmers and workers. \r\nThe Rio Conference opened a new chapter in the history of international \r\ncooperation by addressing the problems of environment and development as \r\nglobal problems that require global solutions. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n81 \r\n(Mr. Serrate Cuellar. Bolivia) \r\nIt established the right to development of all countries and the \r\nenvironmental responsibility of the industrialized countries. It also \r\nrecognized the imperative need for developing countries to be afforded \r\nsufficient financial resources and appropriate technologies to advance their \r\nprocess of change towards equitable and sustainable development. The Assembly \r\nmust turn the promises of Rio into concrete commitments and tangible results. \r\nIn our vision of the global partnership for sustainable development, \r\npeoples and nations assume new economic, social and political commitments. In \r\nkeeping with that \"spirit of Rio\", Mr. Maurice Strong even spoke of an \r\n\"eco-revolution\", urging a change in our perceptions and attitudes. \r\nIn this connection, three parameters can help us gauge how far we have \r\ncome: whether there will be financial resources or new delays; whether the \r\ntransfer of technology is concrete or abstract; and whether the machinery we \r\nare about to establish is or is not consistent with the goals. The answers to \r\nthose basic concerns, which lie at the heart of the process, will be the \r\nmeasure of the success or failure of the Earth Summit. \r\nSpecifically, we agreed in Rio on certain bases for institutional \r\narrangements. On this crucial matter the report of the Secretary-General \r\ncontains interesting proposals to which the Assembly should give careful \r\nattention. \r\nWe must be careful to create the right framework for cooperation, with \r\nthe active involvement of all countries, organizations of the United Nations \r\nsystem, international governmental and non-governmental organizations and \r\nsocial groups. \r\nWith these major objectives in mind, a constructive look at the question \r\nyields some bases for institutional arrangements that could be summarized as \r\nfollows: first, integrating the dimensions of development and environment as \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n82 \r\n(Mr. Serrate Cuellar. Bolivia) \r\nan organizational principle; secondly, taking man as the centre of concerns \r\nrelated to sustainable development; thirdly, structures and resources \r\ncommensurate with the scope of the Summit\u0027s mandates; fourthly, \r\ninterdisciplinary institutions emphasizing action and results, locally, \r\nnationally, regionally and globally; fifthly, consistency with the principles \r\nof universality, democracy, transparency and effectiveness; and, sixthly, \r\ncoherence and complementarity with the restructuring and revitalization of the \r\nUnited Nations in its economic and social fields. \r\nIn the light of these elements, the General Assembly can begin to play a \r\nnew and more dynamic role. The highest intergovernmental forum, it has been \r\ndesignated the principal organ for policy decisions and proposals in the \r\nfollow-up to the Rio Conference. \r\nHe have been entrusted with the periodic review of the implementation of \r\nAgenda 21, many of whose chapters also assign us the role of taking action \r\nunder clearly specified mandates. Some of these deserve mention. There is \r\nthe establishment of an intergovernmental negotiating committee for the \r\ndrafting of a convention to combat desertification, particularly in Africa. \r\nChapter 17 recommends that a world conference be held on the management of \r\ncoastal areas, another on matters related to the Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea and another in 1993 on sustainable development of small islands. \r\nChapter 26 recommends that the General Assembly adopt a declaration on the \r\nrights of indigenous peoples. In particular, it provides a mandate for \r\nholding annual meetings between organizations to work out procedures to \r\ninclude the views of indigenous peoples in policies and programmes. \r\nThe General Assembly should carry out these and other new tasks in an \r\nefficient, transparent and democratic manner, notwithstanding its heavy \r\nprogramme of work. Transferring these issues, especially those relating to \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n83 \r\n(Mr. Serrate Cuellar. Bolivia) \r\nAgenda 21, to the Committees would mean separating environment and \r\ndevelopment, contrary to the successful approach adopted at Rio. He have \r\ndecided, for the present, that the debate will be in plenary and the \r\nnegotiations in the Second Committee, but that does not resolve the \r\nsubstantive problem at the level of the General Assembly. \r\nIt is precisely the Assembly that must organize itself to carry out its \r\nfunctions in conformity with its new mandate. It should give more effective \r\nconsideration to the annual report that will be submitted to it through the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and periodically review and evaluate the progress \r\nmade by the Conference, especially regarding Agenda 21. \r\nTo reach these goals, the Assembly could perhaps establish open-ended \r\nad hoc committees to address the most crucial or controversial issues as a \r\nframework for dealing directly with the problems, broadening the dialogue and \r\nnegotiations and achieving concrete results. That approach worked very well \r\nin the final phase of the Summit, in the Preparatory Committee and in the Main \r\nCommittee, and if it were taken here we would be strengthening the role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in order to ensure the continuation of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. This is the only organ in the proposed structure that can ensure \r\nuniversal participation and rally the necessary moral and political force to \r\nimplement Agenda 21. \r\nAccording to paragraph 38.10, the Economic and Social Council is assigned \r\nthe new functions of assisting the General Assembly in its coordinated \r\noversight of the implementation of Agenda 21 and of integrating environmental \r\nand developmental themes into United Nations policies and programmes. \r\nThe Economic and Social Council will be able to make recommendations to \r\nthe Assembly, to the specialized agencies and to the Member States. Article \r\n64 of the Charter entitles the Economic and Social Council to obtain reports \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n84 \r\n(Mr. Serrate Cuellar. Bolivia) \r\nin carrying out its recommendations, which means a closer relationship between \r\nthat organ and the various intergovernmental organs, agencies and programmes. \r\nEspecially as regards Agenda 21, we must ensure that different entities \r\ndo not act in isolation, with exclusively sectorial approaches and with no \r\ncoordination between themselves or with the Economic and Social Council. The \r\nrole of a revitalized Economic and Social Council should be broadened to \r\nencompass improved coordination of the work and activities of the United \r\nNations system, including the international financial agencies. \r\nWith regard to the Commission on Sustainable Development, we wish to make \r\nclear our full support for the establishment of the Commission as a high-level \r\nfunctional organ that takes under consideration all aspects of the follow-up \r\nto the Rio Conference and the implementation of Agenda 21, with the functions \r\nand powers necessary to carry out its mandate. \r\nWe stress the importance of the active participation of the organs, \r\nprogrammes and organizations of the United Nations system, especially the \r\nfinancial institutions, and non-governmental organizations in the \r\ndeliberations of the Commission. That will provide the Commission with a \r\ndirect, integrated and multidisciplinary framework, both conceptually and \r\npractically, and will endow it with the greatest support and social base. \r\nSimilarly, whether under Economic and Social Council rules or its own \r\nrules, the Commission should have the power to establish its own subsidiary \r\nbodies, given the broad spectrum of tasks assigned to it. \r\nWith respect to the membership of the Commission, we believe that its \r\nmembership should not be the same as that of the Economic and Social Council. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n85 \r\n(Mr. Serrate Cuellar, Bolivia) \r\nBelonging to both would be detrimental to universality and broad \r\nparticipation. Openness and diversity in representation are essential for the \r\ndemocratic functioning and greatest possible transparency of the Commission \r\nand of the system. \r\nParagraph 38.19 of Agenda 21 provides for a highly competent and \r\nqualified secretariat to support the work of the Commission and the \r\ninter-agency coordinating machinery. We stress the need for that secretariat \r\nto have a strong, separate and identifiable structure under the direction of \r\nan Under-Secretary-General reporting directly to the Secretary-General. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n86 \r\n(Mr. Serrate Cuellar. Bolivia) \r\nThe organizational principles of the United Hations should be global and \r\nsustainable. Accordingly, it is indispensable to have equitable geographical \r\ndistribution and the best possible training, bearing in mind the experience \r\nacquired during the preparation of the Conference. As regards the site of the \r\nsecretariat, we believe that missions of smaller countries would favour Hew \r\nYork, supplementing that centre with branch offices in Geneva and in the \r\ndeveloping regions of Asia, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean in \r\norder to advance the work of the Commission. \r\nTime is not on our side. Barely seven years remain before the next \r\ncentury and the next millennium. And here we are, meeting on behalf of \r\nthose we represent in order to pave the way to the future, to affirm the right \r\nof everyone to grow and to share this earthly garden, scarred though it may be \r\nwith wounds that must be healed. \r\nUnity in diversity should be the hallmark of these new times. Man, with \r\nall his values, languages, beliefs, technologies in a word, his culture is \r\npart of biodiversity. \r\nOur \"modern\" vision of the ecosystem as a common home is not unlike the \r\ncosmic vision of Andean man. It is inscribed in our genetic memory. He have \r\nalways known that there was an intimate link between the wealth of some and \r\nthe poverty of others, and that the death of some affects others. The wisdom \r\nof our ancient cultures saw a relationship between the sun god and mother \r\nEarth, or Pachamama. It saw an intimate link between man and the environment, \r\nbetween the past and the future. To be the steward of the whole, one must \r\ncare for the life of the parts and bring them together in one shared destiny. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n87 \r\n(Mr. Serrate Cuellar. Bolivia) \r\nHe are confident that, thanks to the sound judgement the President has \r\nalready demonstrated this session, our deliberations will reach a successful \r\nconclusion. Before us lie the hopes and challenges that the international \r\ncommunity entrusted to us beneath the open arms of Christ the Redeemer in Rio \r\nde Janeiro. \r\nMr. JOHANSSON (Sweden): Let me begin by thanking the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report and for his inspiring and constructive statement this \r\nmorning. \r\nFive months have passed since Rio. The memories of a well-organized \r\nConference have not faded. The concrete results reflected a serious and \r\nefficient preparatory process, and culminated in the adoption of documents of \r\nmajor and lasting significance. The Conference highlighted the link between \r\nenvironment and development and raised the level of awareness all around the \r\nworld. The Earth Summit established the conditions for new political action, \r\nboth locally and internationally. But it was also a point of departure for a \r\nnew era of multilateral negotiation: in Rio we all stressed that the \r\nConference was part of a process and that its results could only be judged in \r\nthe light of the follow-up. \r\nHow is the time to move forward and translate our commitments from Rio de \r\nJaneiro into concrete action. He must change attitudes and policies to make \r\nsustainable development possible. \r\nThe General Assembly is a world forum, an organ for global policy-making \r\nat a high level. It is our obligation to ensure that the policy decisions \r\nagreed upon here will guide and inspire the implementation of commitments made \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n88 \r\n(Mr. Johansson. Sweden) \r\nin Rio. But here we can only forge the tools and develop the instruments. \r\nThe real agents of sustainable development are the women and men working in \r\nfields or in cities far away from the East River. All these people have the \r\nright to expect us to create a firm and efficient system for the follow-up of \r\nRio. What, then, are the components of this system? \r\nFirst, it is the global level, at which the Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment will have a crucial role in enabling the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly to fulfil their policy-making and \r\ncoordinating functions. \r\nSecondly, it is the combined effort of multilateral and bilateral \r\nagencies, as well as non-governmental organizations, business and industry, to \r\ntransfer the required technical and financial resources to make world-wide \r\nsustainable development possible. \r\nThirdly, it is the decentralized, concrete level, involving a multitude \r\nof United Nations agencies and other bodies, including the United Nations \r\nEnvironment Programme, the United Nations Development Programme and the \r\nmechanisms established or to be established to manage our new generation of \r\nconventions. \r\nFourthly, it is the national and local level, where the global \r\nperspective has to be translated into practical action by literally millions \r\nof decision makers. \r\nLet me comment briefly on each of these points. \r\nOur main concern at this session of the General Assembly is obviously the \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development that is envisaged. We are most grateful \r\nfor the thorough presentation contained in the Secretary-General\u0027s report. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n89 \r\n(Mr. Johansson, Sweden) \r\nIn our view, the institutional chapter of Agenda 21 contains a balanced \r\nset of recommendations. It gives us the possibility and the responsibility to \r\ncreate something new and innovative within the United Hations system. It has \r\nto be the central institution to carry on the spirit of Rio de Janeiro, \r\nfurther to develop its achievements and to give continuous inspiration to the \r\nwhole system. The Commission on Sustainable Development must not be bogged \r\ndown in routine reports and heaps of documentation. \r\nThe new Commission should be well integrated in the general activities of \r\nthe United Hations in the social and economic field, with a rational and \r\nefficient link to the Economic and Social Council, as suggested by the \r\nSecretary-General in his report. It should perform policy reviews in the \r\nbroad perspective of sustainable development. \r\nWe are convinced that the Secretary-General will organize the secretariat \r\nservices in an efficient way, and that they will be managed at an \r\nappropriately high level to respond to the new requirements. This means that \r\nhe will have to strike the right balance between the need for integration in \r\npresent structures and the need for a special secretariat unit, preferably \r\nbased in Hew York, to serve the new Commission as well as the Administrative \r\nCommittee on Coordination and the high-level advisory body. \r\nWe have confidence in the way in which Ambassador Razali of Malaysia has \r\napproached the negotiations ahead of us. We share his view that our task here \r\nis to find practical solutions, limiting ourselves to those areas where \r\nGeneral Assembly action is necessary, such as a decision on the size of the \r\nCommission. Our preference is to have a number close to that of the Economic \r\nand Social Council. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n90 \r\n(Mr. Johansson. Sweden) \r\nHe attach significant political importance to the Commission on \r\nSustainable Development. It should therefore meet at high official level, \r\nwith part of the sessions involving ministerial participation. We foresee \r\nthematic sessions and active participation by observer countries. Proper \r\ngender and age balance must be ensured in the work of the Commission. We are \r\nalso favorable to active involvement by the community of non-governmental \r\norganizations, based on the experience from the procedures used at the Rio \r\nConference. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n91 \r\n(Mr. Johansson, Sweden) \r\nIn the opinion of the Swedish Government, one of the great achievements \r\nof Rio de Janeiro was to link environment and development very firmly \r\ntogether. Even if the language in chapters 33 and 34 is convoluted and the \r\nresult of a great deal of negotiation, the basic message comes over loud and \r\nclear: substantial new and additional resources are needed. At the same \r\ntime, the developed world is in recession, with high unemployment and weak \r\ninvestment. \r\nBut perhaps the Rio de Janeiro follow-up can provide some light at the \r\nend of the tunnel: We must not lose sight of the potential of environmental \r\ntechnologies, new products and new business opportunities. As stated in \r\nAgenda 21, resources liberated from disarmament could find their way into the \r\nenvironment sector. We need to display imagination and boldness, not \r\nforgetting the long term because of present difficulties. \r\nTherefore, the forthcoming meeting of Global Environment Facility (GEF) \r\nparticipants is of crucial importance. The Facility has to prove its capacity \r\nto reform its structure, procedures and decision-making, and the developed \r\ncountry participants have to show confidence in the new mechanism by providing \r\na substantial replenishment. \r\nAt the fourth session of the Preparatory Committee the Nordic countries \r\nlaunched the concept of a package of financial measures, including, of course, \r\nthe 0.7 per cent official development assistance (ODA) target. Chapter 33 of \r\nAgenda 21 reflects this approach. We have to continue along that road. We \r\nshare the view of the Secretary-General that the first meeting of the \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development should devote substantial attention to \r\nthe transfer of financial resources and technology. In particular, new \r\nattention should be given to innovative methods of financing, not least in the \r\nlight of the present budgetary constraints. In a longer-term perspective. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n92 \r\n(Mr. Johansson. Sweden) \r\ninternational resource mobilization for sustainable development purposes, \r\npreferably based on fees and levies to control resource use and pollution \r\nvolumes, should be seriously considered. In facing these central issues the \r\nCommission would gain authority and lay a firm basis for its future work. \r\nFor many years now Swedish development cooperation has been way beyond \r\nthe 0.7 per cent target. Concern for the environment has been introduced as a \r\nfundamental objective for this cooperation, and all major projects in which we \r\nparticipate are now submitted to environmental assessment. This year \r\nadditional resources SKr 60 million to support global environment action \r\nby developing countries have been created over and above ODA. \r\nFrom the beginning of the UNCED process Sweden has advocated a \r\ndecentralized approach. It is important to have at the centre a structure \r\nthat functions well. But the impact will be very limited indeed if different \r\nagencies of the United Nations system and outside, including \r\nnon-governmental organizations - are not engaged in the work. \r\nIt is therefore essential that the Agenda 21 recommendations be carefully \r\nstudied and acted upon in the various agencies. All Governments should feel a \r\nresponsibility to take the necessary initiatives in the different governing \r\nbodies. We find the proposals for coordination contained in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral\u0027s report very pertinent. In particular, we feel that coordination \r\nwith the United Nations Development Programme (UHDP) and the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions should be enhanced. \r\nThe United Hations Environment Programme (UHEP) should continue to play \r\nan essential role as the principal body within the United Nations system for \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n93 \r\n(Mr. Johansson. Sweden) \r\nenvironmental matters. It should review its programme of work in the light of \r\nthe results of UNCED and make any necessary adjustments. It is particularly \r\nimportant to strengthen its catalytic role to stimulate and promote \r\nenvironmental activities in the United nations system as well as its role for \r\nthe development of environmental law and environmental monitoring and \r\nassessment. Furthermore, UHEP should contribute to the Commission\u0027s reviews \r\nby providing environmental assessments of development sectors. \r\nThe question of environmental emergencies requires increased attention by \r\nthe United Nations system. In this context I wish to remind the Assembly of \r\nthe report adopted last year on, among other things, the use of military \r\nresources for civilian purposes in, for example, such emergencies. \r\nRegarding the issue of the impact of military activity on the \r\nenvironment, we would have wished to see more progress in Rio, but a beginning \r\nwas made. Agenda 21 states that the same rules should be applied for both \r\nmilitary and civilian handling of hazardous waste. The Swedish Government \r\nintends to pursue this matter within the framework of the Commission on \r\nSustainable Development. \r\nAmong other areas that we emphasize, I wish to mention the energy sector, \r\nwhich is of crucial importance for sustainable development. Increased energy \r\nefficiency and the development of new and renewable sources of energy are key \r\nissues. \r\nIn the field of chemicals, it is essential that international cooperation \r\nbe strengthened. We must build on the achievements of Rio, where the special \r\nresponsibility of industrialized countries in this area was clearly spelled \r\nout. \r\nWithin the framework of the decentralized follow-up, some specific \r\ndecisions should be taken at this session of the General Assembly. I refer in \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n94 \r\n(Mr. Johansson, Sweden) \r\nparticular to the interim action on the Convention on Climate Change. It is \r\nimportant to ensure that this process, so crucial for the future of this \r\nimportant Convention, has sufficient resources at its disposal. \r\nThe General Assembly should also take the necessary decisions to \r\nestablish a negotiating committee for a convention to combat desertification. \r\nThis is an issue of great practical significance, but it is more than that; it \r\nis a symbol of the responsibility of the world community towards Africa. The \r\ntime set for this negotiation is short. The negotiating objectives have to be \r\nlimited and clear, so that a convention which could serve as a basis for \r\nfurther action is ready by June 1994. \r\nAgenda 21 recommended special action in favour of small island developing \r\nStates. Sweden supports the proposal to hold a conference in Barbados in \r\n1993. The Swedish Government hopes that the short time for preparation will \r\nnot create difficulties. In that context it is important that the experience \r\nand capacity of UNEP be fully used. \r\nLet me finally, under the heading of the decentralized approach, recall \r\nthat Agenda 21 recommends a study of the feasibility of convening regional \r\nconferences on transport and the environment. In our view, the transport \r\nsector is of key importance for most of the problems we are dealing with in \r\nthe UNCED follow-up. It stands right at the centre of the debate on \r\nenvironment and the economy, and it literally concerns everyone. The Swedish \r\nGovernment expects the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe to play a \r\ncentral role in organizing a conference in our region. \r\nIt is at the national level that the success or failure of the UHCED \r\nfollow-up will be decided, national and local action has to be taken without \r\ndelay. Information on national action should be provided in an appropriate \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n95 \r\n(Mr. Johansson. Sweden) \r\nway to the United Nations system, including the Commission, so that we can all \r\nprofit from the experience of others. The UNCED national reports set an \r\nexcellent example. \r\nThe Swedish Government has initiated a number of activities since the Rio \r\nConference. Various means have been used to inform the public and many \r\norganizations and institutions on its main outcome. At a major two-day \r\nseminar at the end of August we analysed its results and discussed ideas on \r\nhow to proceed with the follow-up work. \r\nTwo weeks ago the Government presented a White Paper on UNCED to \r\nParliament. It set out our assessment of the Rio Conference and indicated the \r\nfurther follow-up procedure. The White Paper also contained a full \r\ntranslation of the UNCED decisions, including Agenda 21, into Swedish. \r\nSustainable development has to be a reality for all sectors of society. \r\nThe Swedish Government is now planning to distribute the UNCED material to a \r\nvery wide spectrum of society, including the municipalities. We will ask them \r\nto analyse the parts of the Rio decisions that apply to them and come back \r\ntowards the middle of next year with concrete proposals on i-ow they intend to \r\nimplement those decisions. On the basis of this material the Government will \r\npresent concrete proposals to Parliament on the implementation of the Rio \r\ndecisions. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n96 \r\n(Mr. Johansson. Sweden) \r\nIn launching the UNCED follow-up, we are faced with many specific \r\nproblems. The implementation of Agenda 21 and of the other documents requires \r\nserious, hard work by many people over many years. We have to approach all \r\nthe details with respect and careful consideration. But the message from Rio \r\nis above all a holistic and integrated one, part and parcel of the new world \r\nwhich is being born. It is a world that permits great hope, but it is also a \r\nworld of great risk, not least with respect to the global problems of the \r\nenvironment and development. Perhaps we have a window of opportunity of just \r\n25 to 50 years to change unsustainable lifestyle and consumption patterns and \r\nto take radical steps to eradicate poverty. This is a short time. \r\nSo let us take a penetrating view; particularly in the developed world, \r\nwe need to look deep into the way in which our societies and economies are \r\norganized. In Sweden, the Government is currently working on a bill to \r\nprepare a decisive move into what can be termed the \"ecocycle\" society, with \r\nthe concepts of \"reduce, reuse and recycle\" at its centre. This is a \r\ndifficult but necessary transition. \r\nThe very dimensions of the undertaking also force us to take a long \r\nview. Deep-rooted changes in society can take place only over time. They \r\nwill require much educational effort and awareness-building, but the work must \r\nstart without delay. The long view also has another significance; our \r\nresponsibility towards unborn generations. The effects of our actions or \r\ninaction will be felt long after we are gone. \r\nFinally, we need a broad view. The planet is one. No security or \r\nprosperity can be safeguarded in the long term if present trends and present \r\ndifferences between rich and poor prevail. Efficient cooperation for \r\nsustainable development is in the interest of everyone, and we in the north \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n97 \r\n(Mr. Johansson, Sweden) \r\nmust meet our partners in the rest of the world with respect for their needs, \r\nnational customs, traditions and knowledge. \r\nHe need a penetrating view, a long view and a broad view. This is easy \r\nto say, but so very difficult to translate into action. The time for rhetoric \r\nhas passed; the time for action has come. \r\nMrs. FELDGRILL-ZANKEL (Austria): It is a great honour and privilege \r\nfor me to address this audience. It is my strong belief personally, and that \r\nof my Government, that we should stress the importance of the follow-up of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) and the start \r\nwe are giving it today. \r\nAs one of the participants in the Earth Summit, I consider Rio to be not \r\njust a conference among others; it represented, and still represents, a \r\ndecisive factor in regard to both the present and the future of our planet. \r\nFor Austria, the UNCED process is the first global effort to come to \r\nterms with the challenging task of harmonizing both environment and \r\ndevelopment, thus making environment and development issues partners for the \r\nfuture of humankind. \r\nMoreover, the results of the Rio Conference provide the basis for a new \r\nglobal partnership. Now, in the aftermath of the Conference, we have to \r\ntranslate it into practice, as the Secretary-General pointed out this morning, \r\ninto a concrete economic and political reality. For developed countries, \r\ndeveloping countries and for countries with economies in transition, \r\nsustainable development has not yet become reality; it is the objective all of \r\nus have to aim for. \r\nUNCED has already fulfilled a most important task by making both \r\nGovernment and people aware of the challenges ahead of us. We simply must \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n98 \r\n(Mrs. Feldgrill-Zankel, Austria) \r\ncarry on, and I am very glad to have seen and heard so many encouraging and \r\nambitious plans today as to how to go about it. \r\nIt also became apparent in Rio that environmental protection on the one \r\nhand and economic prosperity on the other cannot be achieved lastingly at the \r\nexpense of each other. Moreover, it was once again clearly demonstrated that \r\nthese two pillars on which sustainable development must be built need to \r\nbecome very close allies. For this to happen, we have to work towards a \r\nsystem of open, competitive markets in which prices should reflect \r\nenvironmental costs as well as the scarcity of natural resources. \r\nFinally, Rio demonstrated that the global problems of humanity cannot be \r\nsolved by Governments alone. Hence Austria welcomes the mobilization and the \r\nmanifold contributions of the independent sector. This level of involvement \r\nof groups and individuals is a crucial factor today and absolutely must \r\ncontinue. \r\nThe Earth is the common heritage of all of us, and we all need to accept \r\nthe shared responsibility to care for it. It is my firm conviction that in \r\nthis move the developed countries have to take the lead. \r\nThe action required must start at the national level - at home. I am \r\nproud to be able to report that Austria has already undertaken a series of \r\ndecisive steps to do its share; we will have reduced the use of CFCs by \r\nalmost 90 per cent by the end of this year and will completely phase them out \r\nby the end of 1994; to tackle the problem of tropospheric ozone, which is of \r\nincreasing concern, Austria has passed legislation aiming at a 70-per-cent \r\nreduction in all precursor substances; our waste-management policy aims at a \r\n50-per-cent reduction in municipal wastes within the next five years; and \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n99-100 \r\n(Mrs. Feldgrill-Zankel, Austria) \r\nright now we are preparing a comprehensive national environment plan, which \r\naims at implementing those elements of Agenda 21 that have not yet been fully \r\ncovered by the steps we have already taken and which certainly have improved \r\nthe environmental situation in our country. \r\nIn addition to legislation, initial steps are being taken towards the \r\nintroduction of economic iLjtruments. In this sense, Austria welcomes the \r\ninitiative taken by the Economic Commission for Europe, which proposed the \r\nintroduction of a tax on C02 emissions and energy. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n101 \r\n(Mrs. Feldgrill-Zankel, Austria) \r\nWe support the introduction of such a tax because, as Mr. Topfer pointed out \r\nthis morning, this instrument will be the most powerful single measure to curb \r\ncarbon dioxide emissions, to enhance the efficient use of energy and, in this \r\nway, to combat climate change. For Austria, however, nuclear energy is not \r\npart of this catalogue. Austria is pursuing the vision of a Central Europe \r\nwithout nuclear power plants. \r\nAt Rio Austria signed both the Framework Convention on Climate Change and \r\nthe Convention on Biological Diversity. As a first step, Austria appreciates \r\nthe consensus that has been reached. However, we have to initiate urgently \r\nthe implementation of the Convention on Climate Change, and Austria strongly \r\nsupports this. In this context, may I recall the initiative Austria launched \r\nin Rio aimed at accelerating the implementation of the Toronto target. \r\nAustria, as a country nearly 46 per cent of whose surface is covered by \r\nforests, and proud of its sustainable forest management, supported the \r\nDeclaration on Forest Principles. It should, in future, provide a basis for \r\nthe negotiation of an internationally binding instrument for the protection \r\nand sustainable use of forests, an instrument which iu our view should cover \r\nall types of forests all over the planet. Austria has already introduced \r\nlegislation on labelling timber gained by sustainable forest management. \r\nOn a global level, the international institutional set-up will be of \r\nparamount importance for the successful follow-up of the Rio Conference. \r\nAustria is looking forward with great interest to the negotiations on the \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development. Its membership should represent the \r\nhighest possible political level, preferably ministers of the environment, as \r\nhas been previously pointed out. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n102 \r\n(Mrs. Feldorill-Zankel. Austria) \r\nIn our view, the Commission should be small enough to allow for efficient \r\nwork and large enough to guarantee its representativity. Well-balanced \r\ngeographical distribution will be essential. Given the widely varying country \r\nsituation and interests in terms of sustainable development that exist within \r\nthe traditional groups, it will be important to ensure adequate representation \r\nin the Commission for all groupings of countries and individual countries. \r\nThe Commission should provide for representation of various parts of the \r\nUnited Nations system and other international organizations. Non-governmental \r\norganizations should be allowed to contribute to its work. This will ensure \r\nthe success for which we all aiming. \r\nSecretariat support for the Commission will be critical. The secretariat \r\nshould be effective and independent and draw on the expertise gained in the \r\nUNCED preparatory process. It should be established in such a way that the \r\nsustainable development perspective is integrated into the entire field of \r\neconomic and social development within the United Nations Secretariat. As a \r\nmatter of fact, I think the United Nations might even, by this structure, \r\nprovide an appropriate pattern for Governments to follow in implementing \r\nsustainable development in their respective countries. \r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General recommended that \r\n\"the Commission should build its work on that of all appropriate sectoral \r\nintergovernmental subsidiary bodies of the General Assembly and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council that address issues related to sustainable \r\ndevelopment, and elaborate on that basis comprehensive and coherent \r\npolicy recommendations to the Council and, through it, to the General \r\nAssembly.\" (A/47/598, para. 34) \r\nAustria fully agrees with the Secretary-General that a clear division of \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n103 \r\n(Mrs. Feldgrill-Zankel. Austria) \r\nresponsibilities and the establishment of optimal reporting patterns are \r\nessential. \r\nHe should like to highlight the need for a satisfactory interface with \r\nthe Economic and Social Council, especially with regard to a future \r\ninternational development council function, the macroeconomic guidance \r\nfunction and coordination function of the Economic and Social Council. \r\nThe Economic and Social Council is the charter body mandated to oversee \r\nand coordinate the interplay of subsidiary organs in the three main fields of \r\nsustainable development that is, the economic field, the social field, and \r\nthe environment and natural resources field. It is also mandated by the \r\nCharter to elaborate broad policy guidelines in the field of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Austria has submitted a proposal to enhance the Council\u0027s \r\ncapacity to discharge these two functions more effectively with the help of a \r\nsystem of integrated reports. \r\nMy delegation has taken note with great interest of the Administrative \r\nCommittee on Coordination (ACC) statement to the General Assembly. Since the \r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 will require an unprecedented level of cooperation \r\nnot only between nations, but also between international organizations, there \r\nis a clear need for strengthened inter-agency consultations as well as for a \r\nclear division of labour anong the various components of the United Hations \r\nsystem. Austria therefore welcomes the decisions of ACC to establish an \r\ninter-agency committee on sustainable development. \r\nThe observations on reporting made by the ACC, in our view, warrant \r\ncareful consideration. My delegation looks forward to the findings of ACC \r\nwith regard to the assessment of new and existing reporting requirements \r\nrelevant to Agenda 21, as well as to the recommendations resulting from this \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n104-105 \r\n(Mrs. Feldgrill-Zankel. Austria) \r\nassessment, including proposals to avoid duplication in reporting, ensure \r\ncost-effectiveness and foster integration of environment and development. \r\nRegional commissions will have to play a very important role in terms of \r\nassessing regional situations and of facilitating regional action. \r\nAt Rio we agreed that developed countries and others in a position to do \r\nso should make initial financial commitments in order to give effect to the \r\ndecisions of the Conference, and should report on such plans and commitments \r\nto the General Assembly. \r\nAustria recognizes the need for an increase in the transfer of resources \r\nto developing countries. Thus, Austria has pledged 400 million Austrian \r\nschillings which amounts to around $38 million to the initial three-year \r\npilot phase of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and is prepared to \r\nconsider positively substantial support of a restructured future GEF. \r\nMoreover, with the objective of promoting the protection and the sustainable \r\nuse of tropical forests, as well as the preservation of the natural habitat of \r\nthe indigenous populations, Austria has earmarked the amount of 200 million \r\nAustrian schillings the equivalent of around $19 million - for projects \r\ngeared towards sustainable forest management. \r\nAustria will also participate in the tenth replensishment of the \r\nInternational Development Association (IDA). Furthermore, Austria recently \r\ndecided to increase its contribution to the United Hations Development \r\nProgramme (UHDP) and to allocate $1 million for Capacity 21. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n106 \r\n(Mrs. Feldgrill-Zankel. Austria) \r\nIn the years to come one of the most important tasks of the United \r\nNations will be to look at some of the constituents of the challenge of \r\nsustainable development. Some of these problems are before the General \r\nAssembly. Let me mention only desertification and the development of small \r\nisland States. Many aspects of the problem are already on the international \r\nagenda and will be dealt with in the near future, while others, such as \r\nenergy-related questions, still need more international attention. \r\nIf we are to be successful in translating the spirit of Rio into \r\npolitical reality we will have to sustain the momentum and tackle all the \r\nunderlying problems. Innovation, courage and international solidarity are \r\ncalled for. I agree with my Swedish colleague that action is required now. \r\nMr. MONGBE (Benin) (interpretation from French); The delegation of \r\nBenin, on whose behalf I have the honour to address the Assembly, is pleased \r\nthat the Assembly is considering the report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nresults of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development \r\n(UNCED), held last June at Rio de Janeiro. It is a question of historic \r\nimportance. \r\nThe accuracy and breadth of the report of the Secretary-General bode well \r\nfor the coming deliberations and for the decisions we shall take in the \r\ninterest of present and future generations. \r\nI wish to express my great admiration for Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Algeria, who this morning, in his capacity as \r\nRapporteur-General of the Rio Summit, made a statement whose clarity was \r\nmatched only by its conciseness. As an African, I feel proud. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n107 \r\n(Mr. Mongbe, Benin) \r\nPeoples and Governments throughout the world demonstrated keen awareness \r\nby sending to the city at the foot of Sugar Loaf Mountain high-level, highly \r\nskilled delegations, of which at least 130 were led by Heads of State or \r\nGovernment. This was due to the political will of world leaders, expressed \r\nthrough the General Assembly, and, above all, to a courageous and talented \r\nman, a man of great vision, endurance, generosity and faith in the survival of \r\nmankind. I refer to Mr. Maurice Strong, Secretary-General of UNCED. I pay \r\ntribute also to his team of able, devoted men and women. \r\nHor can I neglect to reiterate my delegation\u0027s congratulations to \r\nAmbassador Tommy Koh of Singapore, who, during his two-year tenure as Chairman \r\nof the Preparatory Committee for the Conference and then as Chairman of the \r\nMain Committee at Rio, impressed all delegations with his experience in \r\ninternational affairs and his effectiveness in the negotiations and in guiding \r\nthe work of the bodies he chaired. \r\nI also reiterate my delegation\u0027s sincere thanks to the people and \r\nGovernment of Brazil for having hosted with such brilliance a universal \r\nmeeting that promoted crystallization of a new awareness that the Earth is one \r\nand that the world, too, must seek to be one. \r\nIn conformity with its mandate under resolution 44/228, the United \r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development, known also as the Earth \r\nSummit, recommended strategies and measures to reverse the effects of the \r\ndeterioration of the environment and to promote sustainable and \r\nenvironmentally sound development in all countries. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n108 \r\n(Mr. Mongbe. Benin) \r\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the Rio Conference was the greatest \r\ndiplomatic meeting ever held. The high stakes were understood by all, and \r\nthis created enthusiasm among States and within the United Nations system, as \r\nwell as among the many non-governmental organizations and other pressure \r\ngroups that met in the former capital of Brazil jointly to consider the \r\nfoundations for our future life. \r\nThe hopes this aroused can be summed up in the lucid words uttered at the \r\nend of the deliberations on 14 June 1992 by a Brazilian journalist; \r\n\"After millions of words, one last phrase matters: \u0027Let us begin\u0027\". \r\nIn other words, after hundreds of speeches by world leaders, the only \r\nthing worth considering is action. At Rio it seemed that in 1992 mankind had \r\nfinally rediscovered the sacred value of its home: Planet Earth. \r\nThe concept of sustainable development must be more than a conviction \r\nheld by peoples and their leaders; it must become reality. Sustainable \r\ndevelopment covers all aspects of human life, particularly the political, \r\neconomic, social and technological aspects. Thus it cannot be ignored by any \r\nplanner or political decision-maker - much less by any international expert \r\ncharged with carrying out studies or developing theories. \r\nIn the developing countries our major concern with respect to achieving \r\nsustainable development is the elimination of poverty; throughout the \r\npreparatory process and at Rio we worked to have this taken into account. \r\nToday poverty poses one of the greatest threats not only to the future of \r\nmankind but to the very future of the planet. Poverty is a universal \r\nproblem. It is a burning issue in the villages and hamlets of Africa, Asia, \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n109-110 \r\n(Mr. Mongbe. Benin) \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean, as well as at the foot of skyscrapers and in \r\nthe shanty towns and suburbs of the big cities of the industrialized \r\ncountries. It ravages Horth and South alike, all races, all religions; most \r\noften it strikes the most vulnerable sectors of society, irrespective of sex \r\nor age. \r\nPoor countries and poor people throughout the world get their food from \r\nthe earth, their water from rivers and wells, and their fuel from forests. \r\nThey desperately need those resources, but have no choice but to overexploit \r\nand destroy their environment merely to survive. \r\nIt was this that we stressed at Rio; it was above all to combat it that \r\nwe prepared and adopted Agenda 21. That is why the Assembly must take bold, \r\nsound decisions to follow up the Earth Summit. Agenda 21 is a world programme \r\nof action for integrating environment and development. It reflects consensus \r\nand political commitment at the highest level between industrialized and \r\ndeveloping countries. Encompassing all fields where the economy has an impact \r\non the environment. Agenda 21 is a rich and varied programme that addresses \r\ntoday\u0027s urgent problems and challenges and seeks to prepare the world for the \r\ntasks that await it in the coming century. \r\nThat is why Agenda 21 places special emphasis on about a dozen highly \r\nimportant programme areas to help all our countries create a policy of sound \r\ndevelopment. They are: combating poverty; providing drinking water and \r\nsanitary facilities; combating desertification and drought; agriculture and \r\nrural development; education; health; long-term management of waste water and \r\nother wastes; demographic policy; management of all types of forests; \r\nprotection of the atmosphere; environmentally sound transfer of technology; \r\nand so forth. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n111 \r\n(Mr. Mongbe. Benin) \r\nThe key to the success of Agenda 21 is both the establishment of \r\nappropriate institutional machinery and the availability of sufficient means \r\nabove all financial means for implementation. By the terms of the \r\ninstitutional arrangements adopted at Rio, all United Nations organs have a \r\nrole to play in the implementation of Agenda 21. \r\nTo ensure the effective follow-up of the results of the United Nations \r\nConference on Environment and Development (UNCED) and to coordinate the \r\nactivities of United Nations organs in integrating environment and \r\ndevelopment, it was agreed that, in conformity with Article 68 of the Charter, \r\na high-level Commission on Sustainable Development should be created. As \r\nindicated in the relevant chapter of Agenda 21, the Commission \r\n\"would consist of representatives of States elected as members, with due \r\nregard to equitable geographical distribution.\" (A/CONF.151/26 \r\n(vol. Ill), para. 38.11) \r\nWhile respecting that principle, my delegation would like all categories \r\nof development to be represented among the members of the Commission: least \r\ndeveloped countries, small island developing States, intermediate-income \r\ncountries, industrialized countries, and countries in transition from planned \r\nto market economies. Considering the universal nature of questions linked to \r\nsustainable development and the effectiveness the Commission will need to do \r\nits job properly, my delegation thinks it reasonable to support the proposal \r\nof the Group of 77 that the number of members be set at 53. \r\nMoreover, my delegation proposes that the members of the Commission be \r\nelected for a renewable three-year term. In conformity with the practice set \r\nby the General Assembly, States Members of the United Nations which are not \r\nmembers of the Commission, members of specialized agencies and observers to \r\nthe General Assembly could be granted observer status in the Commission. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n112 \r\n(Mr. Mongbe. Benin) \r\nBenin reiterates its support for the idea in Agenda 21 that competent and \r\ninterested non-governmental organizations, including those in the scientific \r\ncommunity, the private seci-or, women\u0027s groups, youth associations, trade \r\nunions and so forth, should have the opportunity to contribute to the work of \r\nthe Commission and to establish appropriate contacts with United Nations \r\nbodies. \r\nThe delegation of Benin stresses that the eight functions of the \r\nCommission defined in chapter 38 of Agenda 21, as well as those flowing from \r\nchapter 33, on financial resources and mechanisms, are so relevant that they \r\nrequire no further analysis or comment. \r\nAs to the frequency, duration and venue of the Commission\u0027s sessions, my \r\ndelegation proposes that beginning in 1993 the Commission hold an annual \r\nregular session three months before the substantive session of the Economic \r\nand Social Council. Each of those regular sessions would last four weeks to \r\npermit in-depth consideration of the items on the agenda. The first week \r\nwould be devoted to a general debate on a specific subject, with ministerial \r\nparticipation to the extent possible. Finally, the Commission could hold each \r\nregular session at a place decided upon at the end of the previous session. \r\nFor obvious reasons that members of the Group of 77 have had, or will have, \r\noccasion to state in this Hall, my delegation would like the first regular \r\nsession, in 1993, to be held at Headquarters in Hew York. \r\nOn the basis of the decision of our Heads of State or Government that the \r\nGeneral Assembly should periodically consider progress in the implementation \r\nof Agenda 21, Benin proposes that every five years the Assembly hold a special \r\nsession at Headquarters in New York for review and appraisal; the first such \r\nspecial session could take place in 1997. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n113 \r\n(Mr. Mongb^. Benin) \r\nObviously, an administrative structure must be set up to support the work \r\nof the Commission; a highly qualified, able and, I would add, independent \r\nsecretariat should be set up within the United Nations Secretariat; as \r\nsuggested in Agenda 21, it would draw, \r\n\"inter alia, on the expertise gained in the Conference preparatory \r\nprocess\". (A/CONF.151/26 (vol.Ill), para. 38.19) \r\nMy delegation has confidence in the Secretary-General, who will assess \r\nthe importance that all delegations attach to this question and assign to the \r\nsecretariat sufficient personnel who will be worthy of the hopes so often \r\nexpressed by one and all. The secretariat would inter alia provide data bases \r\nof information and publications on the intergration of environment and \r\ndevelopment, a centre for the analysis, compilation and coordination of all \r\nmatters that promote the concept of sustainable development. \r\nMy delegation has conducted an in-depth analysis of Agenda 21\u0027s 40 \r\nchapters and the hundreds of spheres of activities it describes in terms of \r\nprinciples of action, objectives, activities and means of implementation. We \r\nhave closely examined the important role to be played by the various United \r\nHations organs, programmes and bodies in their respective areas of competence \r\nand in conformity with their respective mandates. We have considered the \r\ncoordinating role the Commission secretariat must play. In the light of all \r\nthat, my delegation considers that the headquarters for this administrative \r\nstructure should be established in Geneva, as proposed here by the Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Benin on 28 September 1992 from this \r\nrostrum. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n114-115 \r\n(Mr. Mongbe. Benin) \r\nGeneva is clearly a central city that can take advantage of technical \r\ncooperation from the specialized agencies more easily than other cities. It \r\nwould also be easy to make rapid use of the rich archives of the secretariat \r\nof the Preparatory Committee for UNCED, without having to move them. Hithout \r\ngoing into the administrative details, my delegation would support the \r\nestablishment of a liaison office at Headquarters in New York and another in \r\nNairobi. \r\nAlthough we share the concern of some delegations that they might be \r\nunable to participate in the activities of the Commission if its headquarters \r\nis not in New York, where all countries are represented, my delegation would \r\nnote that what counts is participation in the work of the Commission, not easy \r\naccess to its secretariat. \r\nBefore turning to the other decisions of the Rio summit, let me say a few \r\nwords on the relationship my delegation thinks should exist between the high-\r\nlevel Commission on Sustainable Development and the principal organs of the \r\nUnited Nations, notably the General Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. As the General Assembly is the highest United Nations organ charged \r\nwith adopting resolutions and setting political guidelines, and the main organ \r\nfor decision-making and consideration of matters relating to the follow-up to \r\nUHCED, the Commission would report to it through the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. The subsidiary bodies of the Economic and Social Council the \r\nCommittee on Natural Resources, the Committee on the Development and \r\nUtilization of New and Renewable Sources of Energy, and the Commission for \r\nScience and Technology for Development would report to the Council through \r\nthe high-level Commission for Sustainable Development. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n116 \r\n(Mr. Mongbe. Benin) \r\nThe second key to the success of Agenda 21 is undoubtedly that of the \r\nfinancial resources needed for effective implementation of Agenda 21\u0027s various \r\nprogrammes and activities. The implementation of the various large-scale \r\nprogrammes for sustainable development under Agenda 21 requires major new and \r\nadditional financial resources for the developing countries. Funds will have \r\nbe made available as grants or under concessionary terms, according to sound \r\nand fair criteria and indicators. \r\nWe know that generally speaking the financing for Agenda 21 will come \r\nfrom the public and private sectors in our own countries. My delegation \r\nconsiders that in the case of developing countries, in particular least \r\ndeveloped countries, whose main source of external financing is official \r\ndevelopment assistance, it will still be necessary to obtain major new and \r\nadditional resources for the achievement of sustainable development. \r\nBenin welcomes the willingness of certain developed countries to honour \r\ntheir commitment to devote 0.7 per cent of gross national product to official \r\ndevelopment assistance and, if it has not already been done, to increase their \r\nassistance programmes to achieve that target as soon as possible for the rapid \r\nand effective implementation of Agenda 21. My delegation thanks the developed \r\ncountries that have already exceeded that United Nations target, and \r\nencourages them to continue their efforts vis-a-vis the countries of the South. \r\nAs to the various multilateral channels and mechanisms, including the \r\nregional and subregional development banks, that must ensure the provision of \r\nnew and additional resources, my delegation considers that as part of their \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n117 \r\n(Mr. Mongbe. Benin) \r\nparticipation in the Commission they should report annually on new and \r\nadditional resources made available to developing countries for the \r\nimplementation of Agenda 21. \r\nThe Global Environment Fund must be restructured to encourage universal \r\nparticipation, to ensure transparent and democratic management, and to \r\nprovide, as grants or on favourable terms, new and additional financial \r\nresources, in particular to developing countries. Access to that body\u0027s funds \r\nand their payment must be based on agreed criteria, without new forms of \r\nconditionality. \r\nAs indicated in Agenda 21, the reduction, if not the cancellation, of \r\ndebt is another vital way to give developing countries the means they need to \r\nachieve sustainable development. \r\nThe delegation of Benin supports the proposal of my brother and friend \r\nAmbassador Ouedraogo of Burkina Faso that a pledging conference be held before \r\nthe end of the current session on the financing of Agenda 21. \r\nHe welcome the establishment by the United Nations Development Programme \r\n(UNDP) of the Capacity 21 fund to help developing countries create their own \r\nnational Agenda 21 and implement their initiatives for promoting sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\nThe Rio summit focused well-deserved attention on fragile ecosystems, \r\nincluding deserts, semi-arid lands, mountains, swamps, small islands and \r\ncertain coastal regions. \r\nMy delegation is particularly concerned with deserts and arid, semi-arid \r\nand dry areas. On the basis of decision 44/437 and resolution 44/172 of \r\n19 December 1989 and resolution 46/161 of 19 December 1991, we consider it \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n118 \r\n(Mr. Mongbe, Benin) \r\ntime for the international community to draft an international convention on \r\nthe fight against desertification and drought. To that end, my delegation \r\nsupports the provisions of chapter 12 of Agenda 21, which calls on the General \r\nAssembly at its forty-seventh session to establish an intergovernmental \r\nnegotiating committee to draft such a convention. In that connection, we \r\nsupport the relevant remarks made a short time ago by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Burkina Faso. \r\nSome 10 per cent of the Earth\u0027s potentially fertile land has been turned \r\ninto desert or arid land through human action or negligence; 25 per cent of \r\nremaining land is threatened today; desertification affects approximately one \r\nsixth of the world population; and the most visible consequences of this \r\nphenomenon are the spread of poverty and the deterioration of the soil. That \r\nshows that our ecological concerns are not something out of science fiction, \r\nbut reflect a very real and ever more serious danger. The conclusion of an \r\ninternational convention on the fight against desertification in all affected \r\nregions, particularly in Africa, containing specific commitments by all \r\nparties, would be a point of departure for eliminating the nightmare lived by \r\nhundreds of millions of people. \r\nAgenda 21 duly addressed the serious environmental problems of coastal \r\nareas, especially the lowest-lying, and by small island developing States, \r\nwhich are extremely vulnerable to global warming and to the rising sea-level. \r\nMy delegation thinks it is of urgent importance to adopt the decisions needed \r\nto convene before 1994 a world conference to pool experience on the management \r\nand integrated development of coastal areas as recommended in chapter 17 of \r\nAgenda 21. We would also support the proposed convening in 1993 of the first \r\nworld conference on the sustainable development of small island developing \r\nStates. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n119-120 \r\n(Mr. Mongbe. Benin) \r\nAgenda 21 was not the only docviment before the Heads of State or \r\nGovernment at the Rio Conference. Four other instruments are also of historic \r\nimportance for the future of our planet: the Rio Declaration on Environment \r\nand Development; the statement of principles for a global consensus on the \r\nmanagement, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests; \r\nthe Framework Convention on Climate Change; and the Convention on Biological \r\nDiversity. \r\nThe Rio Declaration on Environment and Development stresses the integral \r\nand interdependent nature of the Earth, our home, and aims to establish a new \r\nand equitable global partnership through the creation of new levels of \r\ncooperation. It proclaims that human beings are at the centre of concerns for \r\nsustainable development and that they are entitled to a healthy and productive \r\nlife in harmony with nature. \r\nAlthough non-binding, the Rio Declaration demonstrates that the countries \r\nof the world have set guidelines for their mutual relations and for their \r\nrelations with our planet. For the first time, there is a clear mention of \r\nthe right to development, for which the developing countries, along with the \r\nworld\u0027s highest moral authorities, notably the late Pope Paul VI, had been \r\ncalling for so long. \r\nSince the Rio Declaration did not address all the concerns expressed \r\nduring the preparatory process, the General Assembly should adopt a resolution \r\non the preparation of an Earth charter for adoption on the fiftieth \r\nanniversary of the United Hations. That would accord with the proposal of the \r\nSecretary-General of UNCED, Mr. Maurice Strong, in his closing statement at \r\nthe Rio summit. \r\nA/47/PV.53 \r\n121 \r\n(Mr. Mongbe, Benin) \r\nThe non-legally binding authoritative statement of principles for a \r\nglobal consensus on the management, conservation and sustainable development \r\nof all types of forests shows that the question of the forests is linked to \r\nthe whole range of other environmental questions and to related matters such \r\nas the right to sustainable socio-economic development. These principles must \r\nbe applied to all types of forests, whether natural or man-made, in every \r\ngeographic and climatic zone: southern, northern, sub-temperate, temperate, \r\nsub-tropical or tropical. \r\nAt the Conference, plenipotentiaries of States members of the European \r\nCommunity were invited to sign the Framework Convention on Climate Change and \r\nthe Convention on Biological Diversity. Benin is honoured to have been among \r\nthe 154 countries that on 14 June 1992 took the positive step of signing those \r\ntwo instruments, which open the door to genuine protection of life on Earth. \r\nMy delegation hopes that all States, in accordance with their own \r\nconstitutional procedures, will ratify the two Conventions so they can come \r\neffectively into force. \r\nI wish in conclusion to say on behalf of my delegation that the United \r\nHations Conference on Environment and Development, whose report is before us \r\nthis morning, was a major step in the North-South dialogue. It brought about \r\na new mode of international cooperation, even if it did not institute \r\nsatisfactory reforms to meet all the challenges facing mankind with respect to \r\nsustainable development. It began a process of reversing mankind\u0027s \r\nrelationship with the Earth. \r\nThe Rio Earth summit is history. But what we are now calling the spirit \r\nof Rio will brighten with an inspiring light the march of all peoples towards \r\nprogress. \r\nThe meeting rose at 7.35 p.m. \r\n"
