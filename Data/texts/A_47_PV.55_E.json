I-IV and vol.II/Corr.l) \r\n(b) REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL (A/47/598 and Add.l) \r\nMr. RAZALI (Malaysia): The United Nations Conference on Environment \r\nand Development (UNCED), held in Rio last June, was attended by virtually all \r\ncountries. More than 120 Heads of State or Government participated. There \r\nwas a drawn-out preparatory process that involved Governments, international \r\nagencies and non-governmental organizations. That such an international \r\neffort could be marshalled in order to focus discussion in an integrated \r\nmanner on environment and development must be seen as a major, unprecedented \r\nachievement. \r\nUnlike the Stockholm Conference of 1972, UHCED elevated development \r\nissues to an equal footing with the issue of environment. UHCED took \r\ndefinitive steps to promote a global partnership for sustainable development, \r\nplacing people at the centre of this challenge. It was a historic \r\nopportunity, of which we availed ourselves against the backdrop of major \r\npolitical, economic and social transformations that placed fresh demands on \r\nissues such as polarization between Horth and South, poverty and the neglect \r\nof the South and the fragile state of the planet, and with an enhanced public \r\nawareness world-wide. \r\nHowever, the actual results of Rio, in terms of written commitments and \r\ninitiatives, fell far short of the promise raised. To many, the serious gap \r\nbetween the promise and the actual results amounts to a major failure of \r\nUNCED, arguably of historic proportions. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n3-5 \r\n(Mr. Razali. Malaysia) \r\nEven as we extol the accomplishments of UHCED, we cannot gloss over the \r\nshortcomings of UNCED. The Convention on Climate Change, for example, is \r\ndisappointingly weak, revealing political timidity and the absence of resolve \r\non the part of industrialized countries. Key issues of financial resources \r\nand technology have not been adequately addressed, neither is there a \r\ndetermined, clear response to issues of global warming, dumping of hazardous \r\nwastes in developing countries, consumption patterns in developed countries \r\nand nuclear-related issues. Agenda 21 fails to advocate accountability for \r\nsome of the key actors in global environmental destruction, such as \r\ntransnational corporations. A strong code of conduct is required to regulate \r\nthe activities of the transnational corporations. The challenge before us now \r\nis to promote and implement real change from the national to the international \r\nlevels. \r\nUNCED was hardly forthcoming in addressing the inequalities of the \r\ninternational economic structure. The follow-up to UNCED must make up for \r\nthis lapse, examining issues such as the reverse South-North outflow of \r\nresources, improved South terms of trade and the reduction of the debt \r\nburden. Such reform is essential if the South is to gain the necessary \r\neconomic space to implement a transition to ecologically sound and socially \r\nequitable development. Also, we must work for a total ban on the export of \r\nhazardous wastes and dirty industries from the North to the South. On the \r\nissue of nuclear weapons, if compared to the Stockholm Conference, UHCED went \r\nbackwards rather than forwards. UNCED failed to address what needs to be \r\ndone in the Horth in order to shift towards ecologically sound development, \r\nsuch as dealing with the problems of the unsustainable production and \r\nconsumption patterns of the North. \r\nA/4-/PV.55 \r\n6 \r\n(Mr. Razali. Malaysia) \r\nAnother serious shortcoming of UHCED was the absence of leadership from \r\nthe North. The differences of view between developed countries resulted iu \r\nthe lack of a clear sense of direction from that group. Some industrialized \r\ncountries took negative positions. Instead of forward movement on the core \r\nissues, one could detect a tendency, on the part of those countries, to hide \r\nbehind each other, as was evidenced in respect of the issue of financial \r\nresources. \r\nWith regard to the road ahead, it is clear that the transition to \r\nsustainable development involves major changes in the way in which we look at \r\nour use of nature. This is a complex exercise, and one of its basic \r\ncomponents is scientific cooperation, particularly with regard to access to \r\nenvironmentally friendly technologies and, above all, the building up of the \r\ntechnical and institutional capacity of all countries to implement Agenda 21. \r\nThese issues received a great deal of systematic attention in the UHCED \r\nprocess and are now reflected in a series of programmes that make up three \r\nchapters of Agenda 21. In many ways, the successful implementation of \r\nAgenda 21 requires that these cross-cutting programme areas, which deal with \r\nthe knowledge base for sustainability, receive the most consistent and \r\nsystematic attention at national, regional and international levels. \r\nThe implementation of Agenda 21 programmes will clearly involve costs, \r\nwhich must be seen in the context of what would be the consequences of \r\ninaction. It can no longer be contested that developing countries require new \r\nand additional financial resources. The flow of new resources will serve the \r\ncommon interests of the developed countries and the developing countries. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n7 \r\n(Mr. Razali, Malaysia) \r\nHowever, at present there is a substantial gap between the estimated \r\n$125 billion that is required annually by the South to implement Agenda 21 and \r\nthe annual official development assistance of $55 billion currently provided \r\nto the South. Without the means of implementation the provision of \r\nfinancial resources, the transfer of technology and related issues, such as \r\ncapacity-building and institutional development Agenda 21 will be \r\nmeaningless. \r\nMany delegations at UNCED called for capacity-building programmes \r\ndesigned to help countries to develop their policy infrastructures and \r\ninstitutions, to train their human resources and co facilitate the \r\nparticipation of all stake-holders iu decision-making processes. The ability \r\nof a country to follow a sustainable development path is determined by the \r\ncapacity of its people and its institutions. In this context, my delegation \r\nfully supports the initiative to launch Capacity 21 a capacity-building \r\nprogramme in support of Agenda 21. The UNCED secretariat has estimated the \r\ncost in the area of capacity-building as being between $300 million and \r\n$1 billion. Fulfilment of this responsibility will require resources in \r\naddition to those available from the core and special funds of the United \r\nNations Development Programme and other existing mechanisms. \r\nOn financial resources, the developed countries reaffirmed at the Rio \r\nSummit that they were committed to reaching the accepted target of \r\n0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance and \r\nto augmenting their aid programmes with a view to reaching this target as soon \r\nas possible. Some developed countries have agreed to reach the target by the \r\nyear 2000. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n8 \r\n(Mr. Razali, Malaysia) \r\nBut this was not enough, as specifics were absent. The affirmation by \r\nthe developed countries has to be further defined in terms of specific \r\ncommitments so that the enhanced flows of aid to developing countries are \r\npredictable and provide a sound basis for long-term planning. We must \r\ntranslate the many promises made in Rio into specific commitments. We must \r\nalso start the process of developing new sources of funding, because the steps \r\nwe have taken still do not provide any guarantee that the larger needs will be \r\nmet. \r\nThe current situation is not encouraging as, at the end of UNCED, we are \r\nstill not in a position to estimate the amount of the new moneys committed by \r\nthe North. The indications are that they fall far short of the estimated \r\namount. New moneys must also be generated through new sources of funding, \r\nsuch as the reallocation of funds wasted in existing subsidies or in support \r\nfor non-environmentally-sound activities. \r\nAgenda 21 proposes the use of all available funding sources and \r\nmechanisms. Amongst these is the International Development Association (IDA) \r\nof the World Bank. Special consideration should be given to the idea of an \r\nearth increment to the tenth replenishment of IDA. The provision of \r\nadditional funding through IDA, particularly for anti-poverty programmes and \r\nrelated areas of sustainable development, is vital to the effective fulfilment \r\nof Agenda 21. In many ways the tenth replenishment of IDA is a test of the \r\ncredibility of the commitments made in Rio. \r\nHowever, the latest developments in this area are not encouraging, and \r\nthe spirit of Rio appeared to be missing at the World Bank meeting held \r\nrecently in Washington. Malaysia is disappointed at the lack of sufficient \r\nresponse from developed countries. I refer to the absence of any announcement, \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n9 \r\n(Mr. Razali. Malaysia) \r\nin clear and specific terms, of commitment to provide the new and additional \r\nfinancial resources required for the successful implementation of the various \r\nactivities under Agenda 21. \r\nOn the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), arrangements must now be made \r\nfor the proposed restructuring agreed to iu chapter 33 of Agenda 21 -\r\nrestructuring involving such matters as universal participation, transparency, \r\nflexibility in expanding the scope of the Facility, and coverage and \r\npredictability in the flow of funds without new forms of conditionality. At \r\nRio leaders of major countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation \r\nand Development (OECD) committed themselves to increasing substantially the \r\nfinancial resources of GEF and to transforming the facility into a universal \r\nand transparent funding mechanism for the incremental costs associated with \r\nglobal environmental benefits. \r\nIt was in these circumstances that developing countries agreed to accept \r\nGEF as an interim mechanism to fund implementation of the provisions of the \r\nConventions on climate change and biodiversity. However, it is important to \r\nnote that GEF would provide only a small, though strategically critical, \r\nportion of the required new and additional financial resources - only 2 to \r\n10 per cent of the total required. \r\nMy delegation looks forward to participation in the December meeting, in \r\nCote d\u0027lvoire, of the Participant Assembly of GEF intended to restructure the \r\nmechanism in line with UNCED decisions. We believe that the proposed \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development will have an important role to play iu \r\nmonitoring the activities and outputs of GEF iu relation to the implementation \r\nof UNCED decisions that involve utilization of the funding mechanism. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n10 \r\n(Mr. Razali, Malaysia) \r\nThe transfer of environmentally sound technologies is integral to the \r\nefforts of developing countries to protect the environment while promoting \r\ngrowth and development. This, in our view, could be done by making use of \r\ninternational information networks, collaborative and human resources, \r\ncapacity-building, environmental-impact assessment and sustainable-development \r\nplanning. My delegation attaches great importance to the agreement referred \r\nto in chapter 34 of Agenda 21, which, among other things, highlights the need \r\nof developing countries for convenient access to environmentally sound \r\ntechnologies. \r\nMalaysia looks forward to the establishment, at this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, of the Commission on Sustainable Development under the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. Some Rio issues with regard to institutional \r\narrangements are still unresolved. My delegation hopes that these issues will \r\nbe properly addressed by the ad hoc working group on the UNCED follow-up. We \r\nare of the view that the Commission should be composed of 53 Member States \r\nelected by the Economic and Social Council for three years on the basis of \r\nequitable geographic distribution. There should also be arrangements for \r\nnon-governmental organizations and other interested groups to contribute to \r\nthe multifaceted work of the Commission. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n11 \r\n(Mr. Razali. Malaysia) \r\nIn order to ensure the effectiveness of the Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment iu monitoring the implementation of Agenda 21 and all other \r\naspects of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development \r\n(UHCED), it is essential that the Commission have close links with all \r\nrelevant organs, programmes and organizations of the United Nations system, \r\nincluding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the Bretton \r\nWoods institutions. Arrangements have to be worked out to ensure that the \r\nthree entities take consistent and reinforcing decisions on sustainable \r\ndevelopment. UNCED has given us an opportunity for the interfacing of the \r\nBretton Woods institutions and GATT with the United Nations system. \r\nMy delegation supports a separate and identifiable secretariat to service \r\nthe Commission; the secretariat should be headed by an Under-Secretary-General \r\nreporting directly to the Secretary-General. We also look forward to taking \r\npart in the negotiations on other important resolutions expected at this \r\nsession, such as those on the international convention to combat \r\ndesertification, on the global conference on sustainable development of \r\nsmall-island developing States, on the international conference on straddling \r\nand highly migratory fish stocks, and on the overall outcome of UNCED. \r\nMalaysia stands ready to participate and contribute in the work of the \r\nthe Commission on Sustainable Development, since such high expectations are \r\nbeing placed at its door. While we are open to all contributory efforts, we \r\nare determined to ensure the intergovernmental nature of the Commission. We \r\nmust caution against not only excessive expectation but also against moving \r\ntoo fast and precipitiously in its work. The Commission should be seen as an \r\nevolving mechanism that must obtain progressively the confidence of \r\nGovernments. We would be worried if the functions of the Commission were \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n12 \r\n(Mr. Razali, Malaysia) \r\nlikened to that of the Security Council. He hold strongly that the Commission \r\nshould not be dominated iu such a way that development is determined through \r\nsolely an environmental prism. Also we would, with others, resist any efforts \r\nto erode the integrated approach and to \"sectoralize\" away from the Commission \r\nissues such as finance and trade. \r\nFor the countries of the South, UHCED provides a crucial opportunity to \r\nwork for a general policy orientation of the international agenda after a \r\nneglect of over 40 years. UHCED also provides us in the South with a sense of \r\npurpose to demonstrate our commitment to the environment and the state of the \r\nplanet, given a collective commitment to enhance development in the South. \r\nThe countries of the South have a direct interest and responsibility to ensure \r\nthat their own environmental resources are protected and used wisely in the \r\nprocess of industrialization and development. We believe that the South, \r\nthrough UNCED, has been successful to some degree in placing the issue of \r\ndevelopment for proper address. It is now necessary for us in the South to \r\norganize ourselves to influence and steer the UHCED follow-up. We need to \r\npush further the sharing of the overarching conceptual framework of policy-\r\nmaking and action. He expect resistance that will make the future course not \r\neasy, but we in the South will insist on a clear and a shared role on managing \r\nglobal interdependence. \r\nOn the environment we will not allow ourselves to be the sole targets of \r\nchange and corrective actions. Our development cannot be hindered by \r\nimpositions whi^ch shift the burden of protecting the ecology to the \r\ndeveloping countries. He would insist on changes in the North and the process \r\nof self-correction in the North\u0027s production and consumption patterns. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n13 \r\n(Mr. Razali, Malaysia) \r\nIn order to study and review the various implications of UNCED decisions \r\nat the national level, my Government has taken steps to examine the various \r\nmeasures required for sustainable development. These include sensitizing all \r\nMalaysians to the decisions in Rio in terms of national commitments through a \r\nseries of seminars and other efforts. What we hope to achieve in Malaysia is \r\na clear national consensus to formulate overall policies that satisfy the \r\ndevelopmental as well as the environmental aspects of national planning. \r\nMalaysia views sustainable development as an evolutionary process that would \r\nbe phased in within the short-, medium- and long-term time-frame. He believe \r\nthat environmental imperatives need not be incompatible with development \r\nobjectives and would like to stress that an integrated approach on a national \r\nbasis would require and benefit from inputs and participation from the \r\nnon-governmental sector, such as business communities, academicians and other \r\ninterest groups. On forestry, we would operate on the basis of the forest \r\nprinciples agreed to at UNCED and wish to call upon all countries to \r\ncontribute towards efforts which would put in operation the principles agreed \r\nto in Rio. \r\nFinally, Malaysia welcomes the outcome of Rio. The Rio Declaration, \r\nAgenda 21, the forest principles, and the Conventions on Climate Change and \r\nBiological Diversity are agreements achieved at the highest level that we must \r\nnow translate into implementable programmes. Malaysia readily shares in this \r\ncommitment. We recognize the shortcomings but believe that the road from Rio \r\ncan be constructive, given commitment by all. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n14 \r\nMr. WISNUMURTI (Indonesia): At the outset let me express my \r\ndelegation\u0027s appreciation to the Secretary-General for his important \r\nintroduction to his report now before us. We would also like to thank the \r\nChairman of the Group of 77 for articulating the position of the Group. We \r\nmeet at a unique juncture in history. The end of the cold war has ushered in \r\na new era of promise and challenge. The ambitious agenda of our current \r\nsession of the General Assembly clearly reflects the myriad interests and \r\nconcerns associated with the changes inherent to the emerging new era. Peace \r\nand security are now seen as much in economic as in political and military \r\nterms and the degradation of the environment is considered a real and serious \r\nthreat to the very survival of humanity. \r\nIt is against this dynamic backdrop that we take up item 79, \"Report of \r\nthe United Hations Conference on Environment and Development\". Central to our \r\ntasks is the need to build upon the momentum registered at Rio and to \r\ntranslate its commitments and outcome into tangible action. The major \r\noutcomes of the Conference, the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21, have squarely \r\nplaced sustainable development at the heart of international relations and \r\nhave called for a new global partnership to give it concrete effect. The \r\noutcome has thus set a unique and solid framework within which the \r\ninternational community can pursue its critical goals iu the field of \r\nenvironment and development. \r\nIt has also reinforced the growing recognition of interdependence between \r\ndeveloped and developing countries for ecological survival and developmental \r\nimperatives. And it has clearly demonstrated that a lasting solution to \r\nglobal environmental degradation can only be achieved through shared \r\nresponsibility in the implementation of the concept of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Moreover, UNJED reflects a global consensus and political \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n15 \r\n(Mr. Wisnumurti. Indonesia) \r\ncommitment at the highest level on how we, the international community, should \r\neffectively address the situation of worsening poverty, hunger, ill health and \r\nilliteracy, and the alarming deterioration in many of the world\u0027s vulnerable \r\necosystems. \r\nThe Rio Conference is over, but the formidable task of translating its \r\noutcome into action now stands before us. We cannot allow the momentum \r\ngenerated at Rio to be squandered. Rather the challenge before us is to \r\nensure the concrete implementation of its landmark outcome while at the same \r\ntime striving to build an international economic environment conducive to \r\nachieving these ends. Allow me therefore to address the questions of \r\nfollow-up action that are required of this current session of the United \r\nHations General Assembly. In doing so, my delegation would like to focus only \r\non certain aspects of the follow-up process.* \r\nMrs. Escaler (Philippines), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n16 \r\n(Mr. Wisnumurti, Indonesia) \r\nAgenda 21 constitutes a comprehensive and far-reaching programme designed \r\nto ensure sustainable development for the 1990s and beyond. As such, its \r\nimplementation at the national, regional and international levels is of \r\ncrucial importance. Thus to achieve these objectives and to monitor the \r\nimplementation of the Agenda, it was agreed in Rio to establish the high-level \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development as an intergovernmental mechanism. Its \r\npurpose was to achieve the vital environmental and developmental goals \r\noutlined in Agenda 21. In view of the great importance of the work of the \r\nhigh-level Commission to all member countries, it is imperative that its \r\nmembership reflect the widest possible representation. \r\nFor this reason Indonesia is in favour of a convergence of views on \r\nmembership size emerging during consultations among the membership, which \r\nstands at 53. We trust it will not only act as a follow-up to Rio but also \r\nprovide full coordination for all United Nations bodies in the implementation \r\nof Agenda 21. The formulation of its modalities represent the next step. Ihe \r\nGroup of 77 has already presented its positions on this matter. \r\nHe would particularly like to emphasize the position of the Group on the \r\nimportance of the Commission\u0027s functions regarding the adequacy of both \r\nfunding and mechanisms, together with the transfer of technology and the \r\nnecessity of capacity-building, so that implementation of Agenda 21 can be \r\nsecured. We look forward to addressing the Secretary-General\u0027s report on \r\ninstitutional arrangements during the forthcoming meeting of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group dealing with the matter. \r\nWe would like to recall in this connection that at the Tenth Summit, \r\nrecently held in Jakarta, the non-aligned countries adopted a Declaration in \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n17 \r\n(Mr. Wisnumurti, Indonesia) \r\nwhich they expressed their concern with the new and increasing threats to the \r\nenvironment, which, if left unchecked, could jeopardize the long-term survival \r\nof the ecosystem and undermine the world\u0027s ecological balance. They confirmed \r\ntheir longstanding conviction that, since the issues of environment and \r\ndevelopment were inseparably linked, they should be addressed both in an \r\nintegral manner and on the basis of common but differentiated responsibility. \r\nThey also attached great importance to the effective implementation of agreed \r\npolicies and the need for constant monitoring. In this context, in order to \r\nmaintain the momentum generated at Rio, the Heads of State or Government could \r\nmeet at appropriate and mutually agreed upon times under the aegis of the \r\nUnited Nations General Assembly. \r\nAnother urgent agenda item requiring concerted follow-up action by the \r\nforty-seventh session of the General Assembly is that of combating \r\ndesertification. Chapter 12 of Agenda 21 contains specific programmes for \r\ndealing with this serious problem. Its harmful conseguences for human life \r\nand the environment at the national, regional and global levels are a source \r\nof deep concern to my delegation. \r\nIn this context, as is well known, we fully support the United Nations \r\nPlan of Action to Combat Desertification. Yet my delegation cannot hide its \r\ndisappointment with the lack of progress in implementing this important plan. \r\nFailure to do so is largely due to the lack of adequate financial resources. \r\nIll \r\nAs stated by the Secretary-General in his report, funds allocated to drought \r\nand desertification activities are not commensurate with the scale of the \r\nproblems. \r\niiit \r\nHowever, we are pleased to note that, with the advent of the UHCED \r\nprocess, the level of global awareness of desertification and drought facing \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n18 \r\n(Mr. Wisnumurti. Indonesia) \r\nmany developing countries, particularly in Africa, has been increased \r\ndramatically. In view of the seriousness of these problems, it is our sincere \r\nhope that the international community will strive to increase the volume of \r\nresources and the level of assistance for these problems as directed in the \r\nAgenda. \r\nTherefore my delegation would like to reaffirm its commitment to the \r\nefforts for combating desertification outlined in chapter 12, and, on behalf \r\nof the non-aligned countries, to fully support the establishment of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiating committee for the elaboration of an \r\ninternational convention to combat desertification, particularly in Africa. \r\nThat convention should be finalized by June 1994. \r\nAllow me now to turn to a topic of crucial importance to UNCED\u0027s \r\nfollow-up. Undoubtedly, the availability of new and additional financial \r\nresources and the transfer of environmentally sound technology on the basis of \r\npreferential and concessional terms are essential requirements for achieving \r\nsustainable development in developing countries. Since progress in \r\nsustainable development is the sine qua non for a meaningful contribution by \r\ndeveloping countries for the preservation of the global environment, the \r\nabsence of adequate financial flows and the lack of access to technology could \r\njeopardize the significant achievements already reached in Rio. \r\nAgenda 21 has in fact clearly spelled out the crucial requirements. It \r\nstates that the provision of effective means, inter alia financial resources \r\nand technology,\u0027 to the developing countries will serve the common interests of \r\nboth developed and developing countries, including their future generations. \r\nIn this light, we therefore trust that the developed countries and others in a \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n19 \r\n(Mr. Wisnumurti. Indonesia) \r\nposition to do so will give positive effect to this decision of UNCED at the \r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly. It is important, however, that these \r\nefforts not be stymied by restrictions of conditionality. We also trust that \r\nthe developed countries will take solid steps towards facilitating developing \r\ncountries in their gaining access to and the transfer of environmentally sound \r\ntechnology. \r\nAnother important issue for attention in this regard is that of island \r\ndeveloping countries. Such countries, particularly small and remote ones, are \r\nintimately associated with numerous difficulties concerning the environment \r\nand development. Many such difficulties arise from such factors as their \r\nvulnerability to natural disasters, their lack of natural resources and their \r\nfragile ecosystems, together with the high cost of infrastructure and public \r\nservices. In addition, their highly limited internal markets and their heavy \r\ndependence on imports represent severe constraints. Moreover, global warming \r\nresulting in the rise of sea-levels poses special threats to the existence of \r\nthese territories. \r\nAs an archipelagic State, combined with the longest coastline in the \r\nworld, Indonesia is deeply concerned with the potentially disastrous impact of \r\nglobal warming and rising sea-levels. He therefore fully support the \r\nconvening of a global conference on the sustainable development of small \r\nisland developing countries to take place in 1993. This first global \r\nconference should be designed to elaborate strategies and measures to enhance \r\nthe sustainable development of small island developing countries in the \r\ncontext of increased national and international efforts to promote \r\nenvironmentally sound and sustainable development. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n20 \r\n(Mr. Hisnumurti. Indonesia) \r\nnever before have the issues of forest and forestry generated such \r\ninterest as they have today. Hot only are they important resources for \r\ndevelopment, but they are also an important component of the global \r\necosystem. Therefore the conservation of forests is not an objective per se \r\nbut rather an instrument to be employed on the larger stage of achieving \r\nnational and international development priorities. \r\nIndonesia, as a country blessed with vast and bountiful forest resources, \r\nis acutely aware of the need to protect and conserve existing forests and to \r\npromote their sustainable management. Such resources are essential for both \r\npromoting development and preserving the global environment. A proper balance \r\nbetween these two essential dimensions should be sought on the basis of the \r\nright of all countries to develop their natural resources according to their \r\nown socio-economic needs, as well as taking into account their national \r\npolicies for sustainable development. \r\nIn this context, we welcome the non-legally-binding statement of \r\nprinciples for the sustainable management of global forests adopted at Rio. \r\nFor our part, in Indonesia we are acutely aware of the endangered rainforests \r\nand have taken concrete steps towards sustainable forest management, including \r\ncooperation with other countries and parties to achieve these worthy goals. I \r\nwould like to add that we strongly believe that the ability of the developing \r\ncountries to tackle these concerns ultimately depends upon whether or not a \r\nsupportive economic environment is in place. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n21 \r\n(Mr. Wisnumurti. Indonesia) \r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate that while we are pleased with what was \r\naccomplished at Rio, we cannot afford to be complacent. Much more needs to be \r\ndone. Today\u0027s challenge is for the international community to take effective \r\naction towards the achievement of the goals set in the Rio Declaration and \r\nAgenda 21. The Hon-Aligned Movement is seriously interested in the matter and \r\nready to participate actively in the high-level Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. \r\nMr. O\u0027BRIEH (Hew Zealand): The good news is that the United Hations \r\nConference on Environment and Development (UHCED) process has not only given \r\nrise to a good deal of thinking about a new \"global partnership for \r\nsustainable development\", but has also turned out a global work plan to tackle \r\nthe interrelated economic, social and environmental problems identified in \r\nAgenda 21, which was adopted at Rio. The Agenda recommends actions at every \r\nlevel, from the local to the global, to address environmental problems and \r\npromote sustainable development into the twenty-first century. It is a \r\ncommendable beginning, even if it is not the last word on the subject. \r\nThe underlying assumption of sustainable development is that everyone has \r\na common stake in current actions and future outcomes. In an interdependent \r\nworld, development must be global if it is to be sustainable. The vision of \r\nRio can be realized only if the world community works together as a whole. \r\nWe draw satisfaction from the fact that Agenda 21 gives high priority to \r\nthe implementation of what can be called win-win policies that build on the \r\ncomplementarity between po^ erty reduction, economic efficiency and sound \r\nenvironmental management. In particular among the win-win elements, an \r\ninternational trading system that genuinely recognizes comparative advantage \r\nis critical, indeed indispensable, to the achievement of sustainable \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n22 \r\n(Mr. O\u0027Brien. New Zealand) \r\ndevelopment. Without an open trading system, sustainable development is a \r\ncontradiction in terms. Predictability in trade is as significant as \r\npredictability in aid. \r\nUNCED has provided the United Hations with a central role in carrying \r\nforward the Rio commitments. The establishment of the Commission on \r\nSustainable Development is in itself a test of new commitment, as we endeavour \r\nto give practical effect to the framework agreed at Rio. \r\nThe aims are ambitious; a dynamic institution that will enable \r\nGovernments working through the United nations system to achieve an integrated \r\napproach to future development and environment activities. As previous \r\nspeakers have said, we are building the room when the house the United \r\nHations - is being remodelled. \r\nMy delegation listened with great interest to the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\ncontribution yesterday. It provides, we believe, real food for thought. \r\nReform is absolutely vital for our overall United nations system, but for us \r\nthe early and effective establishment of the Commission is an absolute \r\npriority. The Commission must be set up with sufficient flexibility to evolve \r\nover time, to take full advantage of institutional changes in the United \r\nNations system and to respond to external changes as international \r\nunderstanding of sustainable development issues broadens. Through its work \r\nthe Commission may also contribute to the ongoing reform process by \r\nhighlighting areas where rationalization of effort and activity is possible. \r\nBut the Commission on Sustainable Development must not be the child of \r\nthe United Nations system alone. Just as the Rio process engaged the broadest \r\nrange of stakeholders in the environment and development areas, so must the \r\nCommission reach out to and embrace other institutions and regional \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n23 \r\n(Mr. O\u0027Brien, Hew Zealand) \r\norganizations. It must have a robust relationship with international \r\nfinancial institutions, especially the Global Environment Fund, and regional \r\ndevelopment banks. Other organizations, too, such as those within \r\nNew Zealand\u0027s neighborhood of the South Pacific region, should be able to \r\ndevelop close links with the Commission. \r\nNew Zealand attaches importance to Commission attributes of widespread \r\nparticipation, impartial assessment, transparency, equity and accountability. \r\nIf the consensus reached at Rio is not to slip away, it is imperative that the \r\nfull complement of countries, non-governmental organizations and other major \r\nsocial groups that contributed so meaningfully to the UNCED process remain \r\nfully engaged. He believe that the membership of the Commission must \r\naccordingly be broadly representative of countries and regions, with \r\nrotational equity for all within geographical entitlements. All countries, \r\ngreat and small, should be able to take a turn, if they want it, on the \r\nCommission; no countries can or should assume automatic permanency. \r\nHew Zealand is also concerned to ensure that clear guidelines for the \r\neffective participation of non-governmental organizations and major groups in \r\nthe work of the Commission are established at this session of the General \r\nAssembly. The Commission secretariat will also, we envisage, have an \r\nimportant liaison function in relation to non-governmental organizations and \r\nother major groups, keeping them informed of the Commission\u0027s work and \r\ncollecting and assessing information provided by them for its use. \r\nThe neutrality of the Commission on Sustainable Development will also be \r\ncritical to the effective discharge of its review functions. Fair and \r\nequitable governance of the Commission itself, and indeed of related \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n24-25 \r\n(Mr. O\u0027Brien. Hew ZealanrI) \r\ninstitutions like the Global Environment Fund, is indispensable to the \r\nnecessary confidence on all sides that will underpin its effectiveness. \r\nIf the Commission is to act as a forum for sharing national experience \r\nfor the mutual benefit of the global community, it must, as envisaged in \r\nAgenda 21, generate reports from all countries. Sensitivity about sovereignty \r\nhas, quite rightly, been raised. The starting-point should be a shared \r\ncommitment to the principles of sustainable development affirmed at Rio. \r\nEnsuring that the exercise is worthwhile in substantive terms that \r\nindividual countries obtain necessary information on emerging problems and \r\npossible solutions should provide a real incentive for all Governments \r\nvoluntarily to submit national information to the Commission. \r\nResponsibilities for achieving Agenda 21 objectives must be allocated \r\neguitably among nations and implemented equally. Participants will quickly \r\ngrow disillusioned without tangible evidence that progress is being made and \r\nthat all parties, including donors and recipients, are playing their part. At \r\na national level most countries, including my own, are taking a hard look at \r\nwhat must be done to implement Agenda 21. The Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment is charged, critically, with ensuring the shared political will \r\nfor change and providing practical and clear direction on how to achieve our \r\ngoals. \r\nIn addition to fixing the organizational arrangements for the Commission, \r\nthe Assembly is charged with a number of other immediate tasks in the UHCED \r\nfollow-up. I wish to touch here quickly on a few matters that Hew Zealand \r\nbelieves are of significenia. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n26 \r\n(Mr. O\u0027Brien, Hew Zealand) \r\nFirst, a negotiating process must be established to prepare a Convention \r\nto combat desertification and drought. Hhile it does not confront all \r\ncountries directly, a solution to these scourges will boost efforts to achieve \r\nglobally based sustainable development. In the Pacific region the closely \r\nrelated issue of freshwater resources is a concern in this overall context. \r\nSecondly, Agenda 21 has also focused further attention on the problems \r\nrelating to the conservation and management of living marine resources on the \r\nhigh seas. Over-exploitation of resources on the high seas have a devastating \r\nimpact on resources within exclusive economic zones. These resources are of \r\ncrucial importance to the economic development of coastal and island States. \r\nThey are essential to the achievement of broader sustainable development \r\nobjectives. \r\nUHCED\u0027s decision to convene a conference to deal with such problems is \r\ntherefore most timely. The Hew Zealand delegation is at present working with \r\nothers on a draft resolution, procedural in nature, which incorporates \r\nappropriate arrangements for the convening in 1993 of a United Hations \r\nconference on straddling and highly migratory fish stocks. \r\nThirdly, we welcome also the decision to convene the first Global \r\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Countries. The \r\nspecial problems faced by island States have been recognized in successive \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions. Problems related to size, isolation and \r\nenvironmental vulnerability, while not confined to island developing countries \r\nalone, are in character and combination undoubtedly unique. The Global \r\nConference will clearly have a key role in identifying the strategies that \r\nwill assist islands to develop on a sustainable basis into the twenty-first \r\ncentury. \r\nA / 4 7 / P V . 5 5 \r\n27 \r\n(Mr. O \u0027 B r i e n . Hew Zealand) \r\nWe have set ourselves an ambitious agenda. Our efforts to achieve UHCED \r\nobjectives must be clearly targeted. As a general principle, the Commission \r\non Sustainable Development and its secretariat should not take on tasks that \r\ncan be adequately handled in other forums. Their relatively scarce resources \r\nshould be employed in the areas where the Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment has a comparative advantage, namely drawing together information \r\nacross sectors, programmes and national borders, which will assist in the \r\nadvancement of sustainable development objectives. \r\nThe principle of subsidiarity, much discussed at Rio de Janeiro, has of \r\ncourse much broader application. Tasks should be handled at the most \r\ndecentralized or lowest level at which they can be handled effectively. We \r\nall face the challenge of translating this global framework into action at the \r\nlocal level. It is at the local community level that the key decisions for \r\nthe implementation for much of Agenda 21 will have to be taken. \r\nThe tasks facing us are indeed many. Agenda 21 provides a daunting work \r\nplan. We must establish a good international framework for follow-up action \r\nthrough the decisions of tnis session of the General Assembly on UNCED \r\nmatters. And, of course, we must also strive at the national level, as well \r\nas cooperate globally, to achieve the goals set for it by UNCED. \r\nMr. DAHGUE REWAKA (Gabon) (interpretation from French); It is a \r\npleasure for my delegation to be taking part in this debate devoted to \r\nconsideration of the results of the United Hations Conference on Environment \r\nand Development (UHCED) held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 1992. We \r\nshould like once again to thank the Brazilian Government for the quality of \r\nthe organization which it provided for us and which contributed to creating \r\nconditions conducive to thi success of the Conference. Our thanks also go to \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n28 \r\n(Mr. Dangue Rewaka, Gabon) \r\nMr. Maurice Strong and Ambassador Tommy Koh, who guided the UHCED preparatory \r\nprocess with such efficiency. \r\nWe consider that the Rio de Janeiro Summit laid the foundations for new \r\ninternational cooperation in the fields of the environment and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The adoption of Agenda 21, the Rio Declaration and the forest \r\nprinciples and the signing of the Conventions on Climate Change and Biological \r\nDiversity are fine illustrations of that. My country welcomes this and will \r\ndo everything in its power to translate the undertakings it made in Rio de \r\nJaneiro into deeds. \r\nThe success of Agenda 21 will in the first instance depend on the \r\ncommitment of Governments, but it will also depend on the active participation \r\nof non-governmental organizations and of the bodies and specialized agencies \r\nof the United nations system. Its implementation will require a substantial \r\ninput in terms of new and additional resources which will enable the \r\ndeveloping countries to cover the extra expenditure incurred by measures taken \r\nto solve national, regional and global ecological problems, and will enable \r\nthe international institutions concerned to strengthen their capacity to \r\nintervene. \r\nIt is therefore of the utmost importance for developed countries which \r\nhave not achieved the official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent \r\nof GHP to be able to achieve that objective before the year 2000. \r\nIt is also essential that the Global Environment Fund be restructured as \r\nsoon as possible in accordance with chapter 33 of Agenda 21, with the aim, in \r\nparticular, of extending its spheres of action, encouraging universal \r\nparticipation, and providing on favourable terms new and additional financial \r\nresources, especially to the developing countries. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n29-30 \r\n(Mr. Dangue Rewaka. Gahnn) \r\nIt would also be appropriate for lasting solutions to be found to the \r\ndebt problems of the low- and middle-income countries in order to give them \r\nthe means of promoting sustainable and environmentally rational development. \r\nAmong the agreements reached at Rio de Janeiro, my country attaches \r\nparticular importance to the statement on forest principles, which should \r\nserve as a basis for international cooperation in this field. Gabon, in fact, \r\nhas 85 per cent forest cover. The forestry sector alone represents more than \r\n40 per cent of our overall exports, apart from oil, and so plays an undeniable \r\neconomic and social role. It employs nearly 25 per cent of the active labour \r\nforce. The redynamization of this sector will, among other advantages, stem \r\nthe rural exodus which has concentrated approximately 47 per cent of the \r\npopulation in urban areas. \r\nWell before the Rio de Janeiro Conference Gabon undertook to institute a \r\npolicy for managing and conserving its forestry resources by pursuing \r\nactivities such as reafforestation - since the year 1990 with an indigenous \r\nspecies called okoume or gaboon mahogany; improvement in the natural planting \r\nof gaboon mahogany; projects concerning the biology of gaboon mahogany, \r\nagroforestry, the conservation and rational utilization of natural forest \r\necosystems, and the inventory and management of forests and plantations. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n31 \r\n(Mr. Dangue Rewaka. Gabon) \r\nFurthermore, it has established a programme to put in place a network of \r\npreserves and areas closed to exploitation. This network covers 1,800,000 \r\nhectares, which in time will increase to 4 million hectares, under the \r\nprovisions of current legislation. Of course, Gabon will not be able \r\nsuccessfully to carry out this vast programme without the firm support of the \r\ninternational community. \r\nIn accordance with chapter 38 of Agenda 21, the General Assembly has been \r\nentrusted at its forty-seventh session with determining the specific \r\noperational modalities of the Commission on Sustainable Development in other \r\nwords, its composition, its relationship with the other intergovernmental \r\nbodies of the United Hations system that deal with environment and development \r\nissues, as well as the frequency, the duration and the venue of its sessions. \r\nIn this context, my delegation firmly supports the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\nproposals on the operational modalities of the high-level Commission on \r\nSustainable Development, contained in his report. My delegation intends to \r\nparticipate actively in the work of that Commission. \r\nOur shared objective is to ensure that the commitments undertaken in Rio \r\nwill lead to concrete action in order to guarantee better standards of life \r\nfor our populations and to safeguard the lives of future generations. In this \r\nconnection, I should like to recall that in March 1993 my country will host \r\nthe first African conference of ministers for planning and the environment to \r\nfollowup UHCED. \r\nMr. KRYZHANIVSKY (Ukraine); In recent years, issues relating to the \r\ndevelopment of international nature conservation and to the solution of the \r\nmost acute ecological problems have been among the major concerns of the \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n32 \r\n(Mr. Kryzhanivsky. Ukraine) \r\nGeneral Assembly. But at the present session the Assembly faces an especially \r\ndifficult task; to establish the principal organizational foundation for \r\nimplementing the decisions of the United Hations Conference on Environment and \r\nDevelopment (UNCED), which, in our view, has become the starting-point of an \r\narduous but quite real process of the transition of humankind to sustainable \r\ndevelopment and to a new, ecological, global way of thinking. \r\nThe delegation of Ukraine would like to comment on the principal results \r\nof the Conference as well as on some aspects of environmental protection on \r\nthe global, regional and national levels. \r\nIt is well known that opinions as to the results of the world ecological \r\nforum in Rio de Janeiro differ, depending, to a large extent, upon \r\nexpectations concerning it. We deem it unfair to form an opinion about such a \r\nmajor event as UHCED only on the basis of the financial aspect of the matter \r\nand thus regard its outcome as \"a great failure\" or \"a great success\". \r\nIn our view, the success of the Conference is first of all proved by the \r\nfact that, because it was held at the political summit level, the process of \r\ncreating a general understanding of the necessity of environmental restoration \r\nand preservation and of attaining sustainable development received an \r\nunprecedented and forceful impetus. For two weeks Rio de Janeiro attracted \r\nthe world\u0027s attention with its focus on environmental protection issues. The \r\nworld community, including scientific and business circles, the \"green \r\nmovement\" and individuals, is now taking a more active and vigorous part in \r\ndealing with issues of environmental concern. Group actions have been \r\nundertaken by non-governmental environmental organizations. \r\nAll this leads us to the firm belief that the spirit of Rio, born at the \r\nConference and figuratively referred to by the Secretary-General, \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n33 \r\n(Mr. Kryzhanivsky, Ukraine) \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, will not be forgotten, and that the proposed model \r\nof ecological order will function effectively, providing optimum conditions of \r\nlife and development for every human being and humankind in general, in \r\nharmony with the unique nature of the Earth. \r\nThe Conference provided an environmental assessment of major ecological \r\nproblems, summed up the experiences of States in solving them, defined the \r\nmeans to ensure our planet\u0027s environmental survival, and outlined guidelines \r\nfor international cooperation in this field for the next several decades. Its \r\nbasic documents, such as the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development \r\nand Agenda 21, being the results of compromise, may not seem perfect to, or \r\ntotally satisfy, us or our colleagues from other countries. But their \r\nelaboration has convincingly brought us closer to an era of stable development \r\nand testifies to the fact that humankind not only has reached a critical stage \r\nin its realization of the full extent of the imminent danger to the \r\nenvironment, but is eager to avoid it through joint efforts. \r\nUkraine supports Mr. Strong\u0027s expression at the Conference of the \r\nnecessity to continue the work leading towards an Earth charter, with the \r\nprinciples of the Rio Declaration as its basis. We hope that by 1995 this \r\nwork will have been successfully completed and that an Earth charter will have \r\nbecome a worthy contribution to the preparation of the United Hations \r\nfiftieth-anniversary celebrations. \r\nUkraine considers that global environmental protection efforts should be \r\nbased on a solid foundation of international law. Therefore, we believe that \r\nthere can be no doubt that the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the \r\nConvention on Biological Diversity, which were actively prepared over the last \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n34-35 \r\n(Mr. Kryzhanivsky. Ukraine) \r\nfew years and signed at the Conference, should be considered as achievements \r\nof the Conference. We also believe that work on the protocols to those \r\nConventions should be actively undertaken, and Ukraine is prepared to \r\ncontribute to this process. \r\nWe consider that the legal standards that determine the activities of the \r\nUnited Hations in the field of preventive nature-protection measures should be \r\nfurther developed with the aim of more effectively implementing UHCED\u0027s \r\ndecisions. \r\nIn this respect, Ukraine deems it necessary to draw the General \r\nAssembly\u0027s attention to the need to work out a set of international legal \r\ndocuments that would deal with, among other things, environmental crimes, \r\nenvironmental emergency areas, mechanisms for the peaceful resolution of \r\nenvironmental disputes, international environmental monitoring and control \r\nwith international on-site inspections, and expansion of the exchange of \r\nenvironmentally safe technologies. We support the idea of creating an \r\ninstitution with international responsibility in regard to environmental \r\ndamage, and in particular an international ecological court of justice, as \r\nwell as rapid-response ecological forces in case of environmental emergencies \r\nand disputes, including the \"United Nations Green Helmets\" idea. \r\nThe delegation of Ukraine realizes that the implementation of the \r\nprovisions of Agenda 21 will be a labour-intensive and complex process that \r\nwill require the efforts of the entire United Nations system. From our point \r\nof view, the structure of the United Hations bod;BS that deal with \r\nenvironmental protection has become outdated in nany respects and should be \r\nimproved. We regard the creation of the Commission on Sustainable Development \r\nas the first step along this road. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n36 \r\n(Mr. Kryzhanivsky, Ukraine) \r\nIt is also necessary, in view of our environmental goals, to scrutinize \r\nand make use of the Security Council\u0027s potential as well. On the basis of the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report, the Security Council could devote at least one \r\nsession each year to the issues related to the rising environmental \r\ninstability as a potential threat to peace and security. \r\nWe are convinced that the final results of the Conference will mainly \r\ndepend on how actively joint environmental actions will be supplemented with \r\nthe required action on a national scale. The issue of nature conservation \r\nshould be dynamically integrated into national economic policy. Based on the \r\ndecisions adopted in Rio de Janeiro, Ukraine will work out its national \r\nstrategy for attaining sustainable development and take account of ecological \r\nsecurity priorities when adopting economic decisions. \r\nFor many countries, and primarily the developing countries, providing \r\nenvironmental safeguards and the transition to sustainable development will \r\nrequire mobilizing additional material and financial resources, which, under \r\npresent conditions, is beyond their powers to realize without external \r\nassistance. Unfortunately, the Conference in Rio de Janeiro did not give a \r\ndefinite answer to that question. \r\nWe are deeply convinced that every country is primarily responsible for \r\nits socio-economic development, including environmental protection. At the \r\nsame time, rendering assistance to realize transition to sustainable \r\ndevelopment should rather be considered a required contribution to the global \r\nsystem of ecological security. Hew approaches are necessary to find sources \r\nfor its realization. \r\nUkraine supports the idea that ecological conversion can be one of the \r\nnon-traditional sources that is, the partial cancellation of foreign debts \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Kryzhanivskv. Ukraine) \r\nwith the consent of donor Scates with a view to obtaining means to improve \r\nenvironmental protection and the ecological modernization of production. We \r\nare glad that such an approach has found a positive response among developed \r\ncountries. Proceeding from the \"polluter pays\" principle, we stand for \r\nproviding financial means for the joint financing of environmental action and \r\nthe free exchange of environmentally safe and sound technologies and relevant \r\ninformation between States in order to establish a regional and global network \r\nof scientific information centres and data banks on environmentally sound \r\ntechnologies within the framework of the United Nations. \r\nIn our view, there is a considerable potential to provide development and \r\nadditional resources, with the aim of preserving and restoring the \r\nenvironment, including that of the developing countries, in the practical \r\nrealization of the \"disarmament for development\" principle, which would entail \r\ndiverting enormous financial means from the military to the civil sphere. The \r\ndelegation of Ukraine notes with satisfaction that through dialogue the \r\nConference found an acceptable compromise and reflected the interests of all \r\ngroups of countries, including the specific interests of countries with \r\ntransition economies. We are convinced that the earliest possible integration \r\nof Ukraine and other countries with transition economies into the world \r\neconomic system will be in the interests of their peoples and will promote \r\nstable and predictable economic development in the interests of all countries. \r\nYears will pass before the importance of the Rio ecological forum is \r\nfully assessed.. But it is already clear today that its convening was yet \r\nanother proof of the renaissance of the United Nations, which is transforming \r\nitself into an ever more ui.iversal centre for the joint action of its Members. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n38 \r\nMr. NUNEZ MOSOUERA (Cuba) (interpretation from Spanish); Today, the \r\nspeedy and growing deterioration of the environment is possibly the most \r\nserious long-term threat to the human race as a whole and in particular to the \r\nso-called third world. Together with the ever-present risk of nuclear \r\ndestruction, it is the gravest danger to all humanity. As regards the \r\nunderdeveloped countries, it is one of the factors that most exacerbate the \r\nalready frightful living conditions of hundreds of millions of people. \r\nThe Summit Conference in Rio de Janeiro was undoubtedly a gathering of \r\ncrucial importance. At the highest possible level and with greater \r\nparticipation than ever before, the Governments of the world adopted decisions \r\naimed at curbing the most widespread and destructive aggression ever committed \r\nby man against the balance of the living systems of our planet. \r\nThe commitment to sustainable development and the definitions related to \r\nit are among the Conference\u0027s most important achievements. It is a well-known \r\nfact that the patterns of production and consumption of the opulent societies \r\nare the basic cause of the deterioration of the environment. The wealth and \r\nwell-being enjoyed by some of the citizens of the world are based on \r\nunsustainable models of development that the non-renewable resources of our \r\nplanet will not be able to support much longer. In the underdeveloped world, \r\nunderdevelopment and poverty themselves are the main factors of added pressure \r\non the environment. It is therefore fair and timely that the Heads of State \r\nor Government have recognized the right to development, which, as has been \r\nstated, must be exercised so as to respond equitably to the development and \r\nenvironmental needs of present and future generations. \r\nAfter Rio, the task bifore us is in no way reduced. We now have an \r\nimmense body of commitments and goals that, although limited, given the \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n39-40 \r\n(Mr. Nunez Mosguera. Cuhiji) \r\nmagnitude of the problem, will have to be implemented if the first steps are \r\nto be taken towards a healthier life. As part of that undertaking, it will be \r\nnecessary to break down the strong resistance that the industrialized \r\ncountries showed in Rio to the establishment of commitments in the area of \r\ntransferring new and additional financial resources and technology to the \r\ndeveloping world. It will be necessary to define more clearly the \r\ninstitutional mechanisms to ensure the follow-up and implementation of the Rio \r\nDeclaration on Environment and Development and Agenda 21. It will also be \r\nnecessary to work harder to achieve pending agreements on desertification, on \r\nthe urgent problems of small island States, and on the management and \r\nprotection of low-lying coastal regions. \r\nThe greatest danger is that, following the Conference, we should lose the \r\npolitical impetus and the social and moral pressure that led to very important \r\ndecisions. This session of the General Assembly offers us the first \r\nopportunity to avoid such a mistake. Cuba\u0027s position regarding the \r\ncharacteristics, mandate and composition of the Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment is correctly reflected in the document submitted in that respect \r\nby the Group of 77 for these deliberations. Among the points contained \r\ntherein, I should like to underscore a few to which we attach special \r\nimportance. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n41 \r\n(Mr. Hunez Mosquera. Cuba) \r\nThe complexity of the subject of sustainable development and of the \r\ndecisions taken at Rio attest to the need for the Commission to have the \r\nbroadest and most equitable representation possible of the States Members of \r\nthe Organization and for the Commission to guarantee the participation of \r\nobservers under the existing rules and with completely open, transparent \r\nworking methods. The distribution of posts on the Commission must be based on \r\nthe recognized principles of equitable geographical distribution. Any \r\nproposal or formula that would deviate from such an arrangement must be \r\nrejected. \r\nAgenda 21 outlines quite specifically the functions of the Commission, \r\nboth in the specific decisions of chapter 38 regarding institutional \r\narrangements and in explicit and implicit references in the various thematic \r\nchapters, such as chapters 33 and 34. We hope that at this session the \r\nGeneral Assembly will fulfil the mandate to specify the Commission\u0027s \r\nfunctions, in accordance with the decisions adopted under the various chapters \r\nof Agenda 21. If the Commission on Sustainable Development is to be \r\nresponsible for monitoring the implementation of Agenda 21, it will have to \r\nbase its work on the premise recognized in Rio that the implementation of the \r\nenormous programmes of sustainable development will require the developing \r\ncountries to be provided with substantial new and additional financial \r\nresources. The monitoring and review of the financing process is thus an \r\nunavoidable responsibility of the Commission if it is to be truly relevant. \r\nThe support given by the Secretariat to the work of the Commission and in \r\ngeneral to the complex mandates of the Conference will be decisive for the \r\nattainment of the goals that have been outlined. For this reason we agree \r\nwith the proposal that the mechanism to be created should be a separate and \r\nidentifiable entity within the structure of the Secretariat of the \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Nunez Mosquera, Cuba) \r\nOrganization and should be headed by an Under-Secretary-General reporting \r\ndirectly to the Secretary-General. \r\nThe decision on the location of the secretariat and the venue of the \r\nmeetings of the Commission is a matter that should reflect first and foremost \r\nthe objective of guaranteeing the best conditions and opportunities for the \r\ndue participation and follow-up of all Member States. It is both detrimental \r\nand offensive to the small, poor countries that the debate on this subject \r\nrevolves around the preferences of the rich countries and the balance between \r\nthem, when in fact they already monopolize the right to host multilateral \r\nbodies. Cuba considers that the interests enunciated by the small countries, \r\nparticularly the alliance of small island States, should be taken very much \r\ninto account in the deliberations on this question. \r\nForming a part of our agenda, in the context of the implementation of the \r\nresults of the Summit, will be the convening of a global conference on \r\nsustainable development of small island States. For those who have been \r\ninvolved in the negotiations for the last two years and and who are familiar \r\nwith the vast amount of information that has been circulated on the particular \r\nvulnerability of small island States, it will be easy to understand the \r\nimportance of such a conference for those countries. Our aim would be to gain \r\nthe support of the international community for the achievement of the \r\nobjectives of sustainable development under the difficult circumstances of \r\ncountries that, in addition to being small and vulnerable, are poor and \r\nunderdeveloped. \r\nAmong the decision^; of the Rio Summit, there were undotibtedly some that \r\nyielded very limited results because of the difficulty of reaching firm \r\nagreement between all the participants, and those results will sooner or later \r\nrequire greater specificity. Chapter 33 of Agenda 21, on financing resources \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n43 \r\n(Mr. Hunez Mosquera. Cuba) \r\nand mechanisms, is the one we most need to work on. We are in favour of the \r\nGeneral Assembly\u0027s specifying, at this session, the steps and modalities for \r\nfinancing resources that will lead to the complete fulfilment of the \r\nprovisions of Agenda 21. \r\nHo less important, in our view, is the obligation to guarantee the \r\nsuitable, not-for-profit transfer to the developing countries of the \r\ntechnologies needed to create conditions and capacities for environmentally \r\nsustainable development. Until that objective is met, steps towards \r\nenvironmental protection will be very limited. \r\nCuba, a small third-world country which carries out its struggle for \r\ndevelopment under uniguely adverse circumstances and which requires, like all \r\nunderdeveloped countries, international technological and financial \r\nassistance, can nevertheless share with the world, particularly the \r\nunderdeveloped world, the experience of what has been achieved in our country \r\nin environmental conservation and protection, as well as the results achieved \r\nby our people in various fields reflected in Agenda 21, such as health, \r\neducation, eguity and social justice. He hope that those who are able to will \r\nalso be willing to share. I can assure the Assembly that efforts to comply \r\nwith the decisions of the historic Rio Summit are already a reality in our \r\ncountry. \r\nMr. CHEH (Singapore); This debate comes exactly five months after \r\nthe historic United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at Rio \r\nde Janeiro. It provides a good opportunity to take stock of what was achieved \r\nat Rio. The Rio Conference marked the beginning of a new phase of \r\ninternational cooperation for integrated consideration of environmental and \r\ndevelopmental issues at the international, regional and national levels. \r\nHowever, the success of the Rio Conference will ultimately be judged by the \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n44-45 \r\n(Mr. Chew. Singapore) \r\nfaithful implementation of the commitments agreed to, in particular Agenda 21. \r\nTo put it simply, if the Rio Conference is to be considered a success, then \r\nsteps must be taken to ensure the effective implementation of Agenda 21. \r\nThe effective implementation of Agenda 21 requires several factors. I \r\nshould like to highlight tlree at this stage. \r\nThe first is financial resources. The secretariat of the United nations \r\nConference on Environment and Development estimated the average annual cost of \r\nimplementing Agenda 21 in the developing countries to be over $600 billion, \r\nincluding about $125 billion to be spent on grant or concessional terms. \r\nThere is no doubt that the implementation of the various \r\nsustainable-development programmes in developing countries will require the \r\nprovision of substantial new and additional financial resources. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n46 \r\n(Mr. Chew. Singapore) \r\nExternal funding for the implementation of Agenda 21 is critical. The \r\ndeveloping countries, in particular the least developed countries, will \r\nrequire additional external funding, including increased official development \r\nassistance. In this respect we welcome the reaffirmation by the developed \r\ncountries of their intention to reach the accepted United Hations target of \r\n0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance. \r\nHowever, the bulk of financing for the implementation of Agenda 21 is expected \r\nto come from a country\u0027s own sources, from both the public and the private \r\nsectors. A country\u0027s ability to mobilize resources for sustainable \r\ndevelopment depends primarily on its ability to promote economic growth and \r\ndevelopment. At the international level free trade and access to markets is \r\nfundamental to economic growth and development, in particular in the \r\ndeveloping countries. An open, non-discriminatory, multilateral trading \r\nsystem will enable all countries, and particularly the developing countries, \r\nto improve the standard of living of their peoples through sustained economic \r\ndevelopment. Environmental protection can come about only with economic \r\ngrowth and development. \r\nThe second major requirement for the successful implementation of \r\nAgenda 21 is the existence of an appropriate p̂ .an of action and strategy for \r\nsustainable development at the national level. It is necessary to establish a \r\nclear policy framework that integrates environment and development and \r\nidentifies national and local priorities as well as ways and means to build \r\nthe capacity and capability to implement Agenda 21. \r\nThe articulation of a clear national plan of action is essential for at \r\nleast two reasons. First, a clear plan of action is necessary to attract the \r\nnecessary external funding for the implementation of Agenda 21. Secondly, a \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Chew, Singapore) \r\nnational plan is necessary!to build consensus at all levels of the society to \r\nimplement Agenda 21. The main task of any national plan of action should be \r\nto build endogenous capacity. Here, we have found in Singapore that \r\nhuman-resource development through education and technical training is crucial \r\nfor capacity-building. Another important element for capacity-building is the \r\ntransfer of technology and the relevant know-how. In the long term, the \r\nsuccessful implementation of Agenda 21 requires easy access to technological \r\ninformation and capabilities. This would enable individual countries to \r\nexpand and build their own capacity to promote sustainable development. \r\nIn Singapore the Government has attached particular importance to \r\nnational programmes and actions. We began our own programmes for \r\nenvironmental protection some 30 years ago and have put into place an \r\neffective system of infrastructure and legislation for environmental \r\nprotection. We have also formulated a \"Green Plan\" that charts the strategic \r\ndirections for environment and development policies for the next decade. \r\nSingapore would be pleased to share its experiences in sustainable development \r\nwith other countries. We also hope to be able to facilitate the transfer of \r\nenvironmental technology in the Asia-Pacific region. \r\nThe third requirement is an effective institutional framework at the \r\ninternational level for the promotion of sustainable development, the \r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 and the follow-up to the United Hations Conference \r\non Environment and Develop.nent (UNCED). In the view of my delegation, there \r\nare at least four major issues with regard to international institutions. \r\nFirst, there is the question of setting up an intergovernmental mechanism \r\nfor the follow-up of UHCED. In this respect we urge the early establishment \r\nof the high-level functional Commission for Sustainable Development. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n48 \r\n(Mr. Chew, Singapore) \r\nSecondly, there is the question of complementarity, cooperation and \r\ncoordination, both at the intergovernmental and the Secretariat levels, \r\nbetween United Nations bodies, agencies and programmes for the promotion of \r\nsustainable development. Here, we should like to stress the importance of \r\nplacing the new Commission on Sustainable Development within the context of \r\nthe ongoing restructuring and revitalization exercise in the economic, social \r\nand related fields. \r\nThirdly, there is the question of the link between any international \r\ninstitutional arrangements and multilateral financial institutions. On this \r\npoint, we should like to underscore the need for close and effective \r\ncooperation and exchange of information between the United Nations system and \r\nthe Bretton Hoods institutions in the implementation of Agenda 21. There is a \r\nstrong link between financial support and substantive action. That linkage \r\nmust be reflected at the level of international institutions. \r\nFourthly, I should like to stress the fundamental importance of the role \r\nof the Secretary-General in the follow-up process of UHCED. The continued \r\nstrong and effective leadership of the Secretary-General is crucial to giving \r\nthe issue of sustainable development the importance and high-level \r\nconsideration it deserves and requires within the United Hations system. The \r\nSecretary-General should be the focal point for all sustainable development \r\nmatters within the United Hations system. \r\nThe establishment of the Commission on Sustainable Development will be \r\none of the most important decisions to be made by the General Assembly at this \r\nsession. We welcome the report of the Secretary-General on the institutional \r\narranqements for UNCED follow-up. My delegation would also like strongly to \r\nendorse the position paper put forward by the Group of 77 on the Commission on \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n49 \r\n(Mr. Chew, Singapore) \r\nSustainable Development. I should nevertheless like to make two additional \r\nobservations. \r\nThe first concerns the size and membership of the proposed Commission. \r\nThe Commission will have an important role in forging a global partnership for \r\ncooperation in the field of sustainable development. It is therefore \r\nimportant that its size and membership be large enough to allow a broad \r\nspectrum of both developed and developing countries to participate. My \r\ndelegation supports the position of the Group of 77 for a 53-member Commission \r\nelected on the basis of equitable geographical representation. To ensure full \r\nparticipation, representatives of non-member States of the Commission should \r\nhave observer status. \r\nMy second observation concerns the location of the secretariat of the \r\nCommission. The location of the secretariat should be guided by the basic \r\nprinciple that it should be accessible to all States, in particular the \r\nsmaller developing States. Similarly, the venue for the meetings of the \r\nCommission should be fixed in a location where the largest number of countries \r\nare represented. \r\nIt is imperative to set in motion quickly an effective follow-up process \r\nand mechanism for the implementation of Agenda 21. As the preamble to \r\nAgenda 21 states, humanity stands at a defining moment in history. If we do \r\nnot seize this moment and set aside our differences for the sake of \r\nsustainable development, wo shall never be forgiven by future generations. \r\nMr. IHSANALLY (Guyana): The United Nations Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development (UNCED) stands out in retrospect as a towering \r\nlandmark in the field of international cooperatioi. In the long and arduous \r\nnegotiations that preceded the event, many doubted that, as the saying goes, \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n50 \r\n(Mr. Insanally. Guvana) \r\nthe game would be worth the candle, that the results would be commensurate to \r\nthe time and effort invested. Yet, in the end, the Conference has offered to \r\nthe world a blueprint, however tentative and ambitious, for bringing about its \r\nsalvation. It explored the limits of mutual agreement and produced a common \r\nAgenda for the sustainable development of all nations. \r\nThe States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) for whom I have the \r\nhonour to speak today namely, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, \r\nBelize, the Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, \r\nSaint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago and my own \r\ncountry, Guyana - participated actively in the search for meaningful \r\nconsensus.* \r\n* Mr. Dangue Rewaka (Gabon), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. Insanally. Guyana) \r\nIn preparation for the United Nations Conference on Environment and \r\nDevelopment (UNCED), our Governments encouraged a process of consultation with \r\nrelevant institutions, including non-governmental organizations. They \r\nassembled a Special Task Force to consider the particular concerns and needs \r\nof the region. Within the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and the \r\nGroup of 77, of which we are members, we sought to make common cause with all \r\ndeveloping countries. The statement made yesterday by the Chairman of the \r\nGroup of 77 to the General Assembly reflected the priorities that we continue \r\nto attach to the several agreements arrived at in Rio. If I might, however, I \r\nwould like to highlight some of the Caribbean Community\u0027s perspectives on \r\npost-UNCED cooperation. \r\nEver since Columbus\u0027 encounter with the Caribbean, the world has looked \r\nupon our region somewhat as an earthly paradise. And rightly so, for the \r\nrosary of islands stretching between the mainlands of Belize to the Horth and \r\nGuyana to the South are set like precious jewels in the Caribbean diadem. \r\nTheir tropical beauty, evidenced by their lush vegetation, white sands and \r\nazure waters, is celebrated. It is no wonder that the Caribbean is a most \r\npopular tourist destination. \r\nHowever, behind the proverbial silver lining there is a cloud, for, while \r\nnature has been bountiful in its blessings on the region, there is also a dark \r\nside to its gifts. These lands are unfortunately prone to disasters both \r\nnatural and man-made - that wreak havoc on their populations. Battered by \r\nviolent hurricanes, ravaged by over-exploitation and eroded by the sea, the \r\nenvironment is frequently under assault. The precious coral reefs that adorn \r\nthe Caribbean Sea are put in jeopardy. And as if this were not enough, recent \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. Insanally. Guyana) \r\ntimes have brought the additional danger of shipments of hazardous waste \r\npassing through our waters. \r\nAs Pere Labat reminded the Caribbean some 250 years ago \r\n\"You are all together, in the same boat, sailing on the same uncertain \r\nsea.\" \r\nAs a result of these threats to our fragile ecosystem, we are forced to spend \r\nan inordinate amount of our scarce resources to arrest further degradation. \r\nAt the same time, we are obliged to provide our peoples with the basic \r\nnecessities of life. These twin responsibilities were acknowledged by the \r\nFirst CARICOM Ministerial Conference on the Environment when it stated \r\n\"Central to all our environmental concerns is our shared desire for Man\u0027s \r\nsurvival in a manner that is both in harmony with nature and consistent \r\nwith human welfare.\" \r\nThe CARICOM States are therefore pleased that this symbiotic link between \r\nthe environment and development has been fully recognized and enshrined in the \r\ndeclaration of principles that issued from Rio. We are satisfied that \r\nAgenda 21 represents an ambitious and comprehensive attempt to translate our \r\naspirations into reality. We realize, of course, that this cannot be done all \r\nat once. We would therefore urge that Agenda 21 be examined with an eye to \r\nestablishing our priorities for action. In many cases, the Agenda has set \r\nspecific targets and timetables. It is important that these be scrupulously \r\nfollowed and that the dynamic momentum achieved at Rio be sustained. \r\nUndoubtedly, our most urgent task is the creation of a commission on \r\nsustainable development to satisfy the clear need for a suitable body to \r\nensure the effective follow-up of all UHCED decisions and to monitor the \r\nprogress of the implementation of Agenda 21. Given these important functions. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Insanally, Guyana) \r\nit is imperative that the commission be clearly democratic in concept, \r\ncomposition and operation. It may be recalled that, while it was agreed in \r\nRio to make the commission a subsidiary body of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, this was done largely for the sake of administrative convenience. \r\nThe general understanding, however, is that the commission should be \r\nautonomous and high level in order to function effectively. Its membership \r\nshould be sufficiently large to allow for adequate representation by \r\ndeveloping countries. In this regard, the CARICOM countries believe that it \r\nshould have 53 seats, decided on the basis of the Council formula as applied \r\nto the high-level Commission on Science and Technology for Development. \r\nWith regard to the functions of the Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, we would wish to give special importance to national \r\ncapacity-building in developing countries. An independent provision should \r\ntherefore be made under financing that would require the Commission to monitor \r\nassistance to these countries so as to ensure their capability to undertake \r\ntheir obligations under Agenda 21. In so far as the service secretariat is \r\nconcerned, we are in agreement with the structure proposed by the Group of \r\n77. He would, however, ask that due attention be given to the need for \r\ngender-balance. Moreover, the Commission should ideally be located in \r\nNew York so as to facilitate maximum participation by the developing countries. \r\nCARICOM fully endorses the proposal for a review meeting in 1997. The \r\nprogramme of work of the Commission in the initial stages would seem to \r\nsuggest, however, that at least in the first two or three years, the \r\nCommission should aim to meet at least twice a year. In any event, a \r\nprogramme of meetings up to 1997 would seem to be highly desirable. He would \r\nask that in preparing for these meetings, the Commission should seek to \r\nfacilitate the continuous participation of developing countries, in \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n54 \r\n(Mr. Insanally. Guyana) \r\nparticular, small island States and the least developed countries. The \r\nCARICOM countries intend to play a full and active role in the work of the \r\nCommission and will therefore seek appropriate representation on it. \r\nLooking beyond the creation of the Commission, we would wish to call \r\nattention to several important follow-up conferences on the environment and \r\ndevelopment calendar. It is not too early to begin addressing our minds to \r\nthe organization of these meetings. The CARICOM countries understandably have \r\na particular interest in the convening in 1993 of the first global conference \r\non the sustainable development of small island States. The aim of this \r\nconference is, inter alia, to develop and strengthen inter-island, regional \r\nand inter-regional cooperation and information so as to reduce the inherent \r\nvulnerability of small States. We urge full support of the conference, which \r\nour sister State of Barbados has kindly agreed to host. \r\nOf special concern to CARICOM is the issue of general marine and \r\nintegrated coastal zone management. The problems of global warming and \r\nsea-level rise are already being felt in some of our countries, which are \r\nforced, as a consequence, to wage a constant and costly battle with the sea in \r\norder to protect valuable coastal areas and economic resources. The \r\nendangered marine resources contained in our exclusive economic zones are also \r\nessential to our economic and social development. As recognized in Agenda 21, \r\nthere is a dire need for international cooperation and coordination at all \r\nlevels \r\n\"to support and supplement national efforts of coastal States to promote \r\nintegrated management and sustainable development of coastal and marine \r\nareas.\" (A/COHF.151/26 (vol. II). para. 17.10) \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n55 \r\n(Mr. Insanally. Guyana) \r\nIt is hoped that the conference recommended at Rio to address this issue can \r\nbe held before 1994. At stake is the very viability and survival of some of \r\nour countries. \r\nAlthough Agenda 21 does not prescribe any specific action to be taken by \r\nthe Assembly in order to ensure the sustainable use of forests, it is none the \r\nless important for the international community to abide as of now by the \r\nstatement of principles agreed upon in Rio. We must also proceed to put in \r\nplace the review mechanisms to determine to what extent these principles have \r\nserved our purpose and to chart a plan for the management of our forests. \r\nThis entails the continuing examination of the need for and feasibility of \r\nappropriate international arrangements \r\n\"to promote international cooperation on forest management, conservation \r\nand sustainable development of all types of forests, including \r\nafforestation, reforestation and rehabilitation\". (A/COHF.151/26 \r\n(vol. II). para. 11.12 (el) \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n56 \r\n(Mr. Insanally. Guyana) \r\nForest conservation, management and development are viewed by our \r\nGovernments as critical elements of a strategy for environmental rectitude. \r\nIn this context CARICOM has endorsed fully the Iwokrama project for the \r\nsustainable development and conservation of 900,000 acres of virgin Amazonian \r\nrain forest in the heart of my country\u0027s hinterland. This project has been \r\nlaunched as one of regional interest, with the collaborative involvement of \r\nthe Commonwealth Secretariat, other Commonwealth Governments, the United \r\nHations Development Programme (UHDP) and other international agencies. \r\nWith respect to those countries which are under threat of \r\ndesertification, the CARICOM countries repeat their call for the early \r\nintroduction of an international convention on halting desertification, \r\nparticularly in Africa, the region most affected by this dreadful scourge. At \r\nthe same time we would urge the early convening of an intergovernmental \r\nconference under United Hations auspices with a view to promoting effective \r\nimplementation of the provisions of the United Hations Convention on the Law \r\nof the Sea on straddling fish stocks and highly migratory species. This forum \r\nshould provide a timely opportunity for considering means of improving \r\ncooperation on fisheries among States and formulating appropriate \r\nrecommendations. The work and the results of the conference should be fully \r\nconsistent with the law of the sea Treaty which we trust will shortly come \r\ninto force. \r\nTwo important Conventions which have already been agreed upon by the \r\ninternational community - namely on biodiversity and climate change now \r\ndemand that an impetus be given to their early ratification and \r\nimplementation. In the case of the climate change treaty, we should now \r\ncontemplate the development of new protocols, especially one aimed at limiting \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Insanally, Guyana) \r\nthe emission of greenhouse gases and at dealing with the harmful consequences \r\nof sea-level rise. It is understood that the Intergovernmental negotiating \r\nCommittee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change is due to meet in early \r\nDecember to prepare for the convening of a conference of the parties. With \r\nregard to the Convention on Biological Diversity, an area which is the common \r\nconcern of humankind, the contracting parties must now proceed, according to \r\ntheir particular capabilities, to formulate strategies for its practical \r\nimplementation. \r\nThis quick review of the post-UHCED agenda again points up the \r\nindispensability of two important provisions, namely the transfer of \r\nappropriate technology and adequate financial resources to enable developing \r\ncountries to fulfil their obligations under the Rio compact. Developing \r\ncountries must have access to environmentally sound technologies on a grant or \r\nconcessional basis in order to deal with these responsibilities. They must \r\nequally have at their disposal new and additional resources to be able to \r\nsatisfy the several financial requirements. We would therefore appeal to our \r\ndeveloped partners to address these issues urgently and, as was envisaged at \r\nRio, announce their commitments at this session of the General Assembly. \r\nIt has been estimated that the resources needed annually for the adequate \r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 in developing countries is of the order of \r\n$600 billion. This may seem an astronomical sum but with the cooperation of \r\nboth developed and developing countries the financial needs can be met. \r\nObviously, given the principle of differentiated responsibilities, the \r\ndeveloped countries will be expected to make the much greater contribution. \r\nThis is as it should be since the burden of responsibility on developing \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr. Insanally. Guvana) \r\ncountries will be especially onerous. Our share has to be measured not only \r\nby our portion of the financial costs but also by the sacrifice resulting from \r\nthe constraints inherent in the need to balance the use of our natural \r\nresources and the demands of environmental conservation. In the reckoning \r\ntoo, one must take into account the burden faced by our societies in the cost \r\nof debt-servicing and the undertaking of major structural adjustment \r\nprogrammes. \r\nWe therefore call upon the developed countries to attain quickly the \r\nlong-stipulated goal of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product (GHP) for \r\nofficial development assistance. This step alone would realize a significant \r\namount towards reaching our target. He would also expect an appreciable tenth \r\nreplenishment of the International Development Association (IDA) enhanced by \r\nan Earth increment especially earmarked for environmental purposes. He would \r\nat the same time encourage the exploration of all possible sources of \r\nfunding. The successful launching of Agenda 21 will demand substantial early \r\ncommitments of concessional financing for developing countries. He must act \r\non this now. \r\nThe Global Environment Facility will be an important mechanism for \r\nchannelling resources to the twin areas of the environment and development. \r\nHe should not delay the task of restructuring it to enable it to operate in \r\noptimal fashion. In order to do so, it should have three essential \r\ncharacteristics. First, it should be universal in membership with broader and \r\nmore equitable representation. Secondly, its resources should be more \r\naccessible to the needs of small island and low-lying States. And, thirdly, \r\nthere should at all times be transparency and accountability in its operations. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n59 \r\n(Mr. Insanally. Guyana) \r\nStill on the subject of financing, the CARICOM countries would wish to \r\nwelcome the provisions outlined by UNDP for inputs under Capacity 21. \r\nNational capacity-building effectively to implement Agenda 21 is a priority \r\nrequirement of most, if not all, developing countries. The CARICOM countries \r\ncertainly have specific needs in this area and therefore welcome the mandate \r\nwhich has been given to UNDP and all multilateral institutions for the \r\nprovision of assistance. As I have already stated, one of the most important \r\ntasks for the Commission on Sustainable Development would be to monitor the \r\nimplementation of this mandate. \r\nThese are some of the broad perspectives which CARICOM will bring to bear \r\nduring the more detailed discussions of these issues in the Second Committee. \r\nIt is to be hoped that the spirit of cooperation and consensus which was \r\nmanifest in Rio will pervade these deliberations so that at the end of the day \r\nwe can say that another positive step has been taken towards realizing the \r\naspirations and goals of UNCED. For our part, CARICOM countries are \r\ndetermined to continue their close collaboration and coordination to ensure \r\nthe full and rapid implementation of Agenda 21. \r\nAs we stand at the threshold of the twenty-first century, we cannot but \r\nbe conscious of the perilous stage which civilization has reached. In his \r\nrelentless pursuit of progress man has recklessly ravaged his environment. As \r\na result the world is today under serious threat of irreparable destruction. \r\nUNCED has enjoined us to act collectively to avert this disaster. Agenda 21 \r\noffers a rescue plan. He must together begin to implement it. In the words \r\nof one of our Caribbean poets; \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n60 \r\n(Mr. Insanally. Guvana) \r\n\"Like a jig shakes the loom; \r\n\"Like a web is spun the pattern; \r\n\"All are involved! \r\n\"All are consumed!\" \r\nHe are thus destined - developed and developing to work together for \r\nour survival and that of the planet Earth. This is an obligation which cannot \r\nsafely be postponed. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n61 \r\nMr. MUSUKA (Zambia); Zambia welcomes the opportunity to participate \r\nin this debate marking the first stage in the international community\u0027s \r\nefforts to initiate the follow-up process of the United Nations Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development (UHCED) held in June this year at Rio de Janeiro. \r\nMy delegation would like to extend its appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations and to the Rapporteur-General of the United \r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development, the Foreign Minister of \r\nAlgeria, for the comprehensive introduction of the report of the United \r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development. \r\nIn welcoming the report, I should also like to pay tribute to all \r\nparticipants in the United Hations Conference on Environment and Development, \r\nas well as those who participated in the preparatory process. As observed by \r\nthe Secretary-General in his report, the Conference was unprecedented in many \r\nrespects which makes it a unique achievement in the process of international \r\ncooperation. \r\nThe international community came out of Rio de Janeiro with a helpful \r\nagenda that can usher our world into a new age of sustainable development \r\nour basic condition for evolving the common resolve that should commit the \r\ninternational community to safeguarding the environment for present and future \r\ngenerations. \r\nIn this respect, the task of the Assembly is to harness the spirit of Rio \r\nde Janeiro and evolve an innovative system of international cooperation for \r\nsustainable development. My delegation deems it imperative for nations of the \r\nworld to form a formidable alliance fully dedicated to fostering sustainable \r\ndevelopment in order appropriately to implement the agenda agreed upon in Rio \r\nde Janeiro and where necessary to build upon it. \r\nLaudable efforts that aim at facilitating international cooperation for \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Musuka, Zambia) \r\nsustainable development started in Rio de Janeiro as reflected in the report \r\nof the Conference. In looking beyond Rio de Janeiro, we also see hopeful \r\nsigns of greater willingness among Governments to pool their influence and \r\ncome up with an intergovernmental structure that will be at the heart of the \r\npost-Rio process. \r\nHowever, let us all remember that institutional mechanisms will only be a \r\nplatform for implementing the multifaceted agenda for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Of crucial concern to the developing countries is whether or not \r\nthey will get the \"environmental space\" they crucially need to participate in \r\nthe agenda for sustainable development. \r\nThis concern has lingered on because it defines the capacity of \r\ndeveloping countries to take up the additional burden of protecting the \r\nenvironment while attempting to implement the difficult agenda of development. \r\nThe concept of sustainable development, suggesting an idea of full \r\nintegration of environmental and developmental concerns, cannot be carried to \r\nits logical conclusion if one part of the international community remains \r\nunable to rise to the challenges placed upon it without risking \r\nretrogression. In this regard, greater willingness to cooperate among nations \r\nof the world must be followed by greater commitment to the fundamentals that \r\ngive substance to the imperatives of cooperation and, in the process, generate \r\ngreater confidence in the mutual responsibility of moving forward into the \r\nfuture. \r\nThe massive problems of drought, desertification, the dumping of toxic \r\nwaste and poverty, all of which have an adverse impact on the environment, \r\nstill stand out as major concerns of the developing countries. The agreed \r\ninitiative to negotiate an international convention to combat desertification. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n63-65 \r\n(Mr. Musuka, Zambia) \r\nwhich is before the current session of the General Assembly, will be an \r\ninstrument by which to add to the hopes of millions of people in developing \r\ncountries, particularly in Africa, eking out an existence in the harsh \r\nconditions of vanishing life-support systems. Drought and desertification, \r\nbeing inseparable, demand that the proposed international convention include \r\nadeguate provisions to assist afflicted countries in withstanding the effects \r\nof droughts and rehabilitating ravaged ecosystems. \r\nThere are other concerns that will affect our transition to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Through preferential technology transfers, the international \r\ncommunity possesses the capacity to assist many countries of the world to \r\ninitiate a development process that transcends the patterns that have hitherto \r\nbeen environmentally degrading. The process of education and training for \r\ntechnological advancement, complemented by the enhanced savings potential of \r\ndeveloping countries through external debt reduction and multilateral trade \r\nliberalization in the Uruguay Round, can generate incentives for developing \r\nenvironmentally sound technologies, notwithstanding the need for developed \r\ncountries to improve access by developing countries to environmentally sound \r\ntechnologies. \r\nRio de Janeiro opened a new chapter in cooperation between national \r\nGovernments and private enterprise. It will be the duty of every Government \r\nto generate incentives that will promote private sector investments generating \r\nenvironmentally sound manufacturing and waste disposal. The basic challenge \r\nwill be for Governments to design environmental policies that set high and \r\ntruly competitive standards. Protectionism, or its threat, disguised as \r\nenvironmental sustainability, runs the risk of generating selectivity and \r\nundermining sovereignty in the enforcement of environmental standards, \r\nespecially in sensitive areas, such as trade in tropical timber. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n66 \r\n(Mr. Musuka. Zambia) \r\nThe emerging change towards sustainable development offers unprecedented \r\nopportunities. Our world body has a crucial opportunity to improve and \r\nstrengthen the Secretariat and intergovernmental structures as we evolve \r\ninstitutional arrangements to underpin the long-term involvement of the United \r\nNations in integrating environment and development. It is my delegation\u0027s \r\nhope that agencies like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for \r\nReconstruction and Development (IBRD) will also develop reforms complementary \r\nto the efforts we are undertaking at this session of the General Assembly. \r\nThe international community also has a timely and unprecedented \r\nopportunity to initiate a concerted attack on poverty and meet basic human \r\nneeds in addition to empowering billions of people world wide to lead \r\nproductive lives. \r\nIn all these opportunities, and innumerable others, the manner in which \r\nthe international community will harness the spirit of compromise and \r\ncommitment to change will define the possibilities of making meaningful use of \r\nthe opportunities for preserving the integrity of the environment. The road \r\nto Rio identified opportunities and difficulties. Rio itself developed new \r\nvalues which the international community has to build upon. It will be \r\npossible to do so if the international community invokes the human spirit to \r\nsurvive. \r\nMr. NYAKYI (United Republic of Tanzania); It is a great pleasure \r\nfor my delegation to address the General Assembly on the very important item \r\non the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED). \r\nMy delegation listened very carefully to the statement made yesterday by \r\nthe Secretary-General on the restructuring of the United Nations and on the \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n67 \r\n(Mr. Hyakvi. United Republic \r\nof Tanzania) \r\nnecessary follow-up, with additional arrangements, to the United Nations \r\nConference on Environment and Development. The statement gives us a sense of \r\nhis commitment to the building of a United Hations which is responsive to the \r\nneeds and aspirations of the peoples of the world not just in the economic \r\nand social fields, but in all other areas of human endeavour. I thank the \r\nSecretary-General for a very inspiring address. I should also like to thank \r\nthe delegation of Pakistan for its statement. My delegation fully endorses \r\nthe statement delivered yesterday by Mr. Akram Zaki, the Secretary-General of \r\nthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, who spoke also on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77. \r\nThe Rio Conference was the culmination of a 20-year campaign of \r\nsensitizing the world community and persuading it that environmental problems \r\nare global in nature, that their solution will thus require an international \r\nconsensus, and that to ascertain the sustainable existence of our fragile \r\nplanet Earth requires the integration of developmental and environmental \r\nprogrammes. That is what Agenda 21 endeavours to do. It is a commitment by \r\nStates to establish a new global partnership in order to engage in a \r\ncontinuous dialogue inspired by the need to achieve a more efficient and \r\nequitable world economy and by the imperative of protecting the environment. \r\nIt is therefore the responsibility of the General Assembly at its \r\nforty-seventh session to build on the impetus which was created at Rio by \r\nestablishing strong and effective follow-up institutional arrangements. \r\nThe painstaking efforts devoted to the intricate process of negotiation \r\nwhich characterized the UNCED process from the first session of the \r\nPreparatory Committee through the fourth session and the intergovernmental \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n68 \r\n(Mr. Nyakyi, United Republic \r\nof Tanzania) \r\nnegotiating process for the Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on \r\nBiodiversity is a clear demonstration of the international community\u0027s \r\ninterest in, and according of priority to the issue of environment and \r\ndevelopment. The 1972 United nations Conference on Human Environment was a \r\nconference which brought together industrialized and developing nations to \r\ndelineate the rights of the human family to a healthy and productive \r\nenvironment. The Rio Conference defined actions which humankind has resolved \r\nto take for its sustainable survival in a healthy environment. This means \r\nthat unless Agenda 21 is implemented in its entirety the whole exercise which \r\nled to Rio will have been futile. \r\nIt is now almost five months since we departed from the beautiful city of \r\nRio de Janeiro, satisfied that we had successfully negotiated an agenda which \r\nwill deliver us into the twenty-first century. Unfortunately, it appears as \r\nif not all the square brackets placed around the means of implementation \r\nduring the preparatory process were removed by the Conference. The developed \r\ncountries have yet to make concrete pledges which will commit them to the \r\nimplementation of Agenda 21. \r\nThe principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, agreed at \r\nthe Conference, has not been translated by States into a concrete resolve to \r\nplay their part in this endeavour. The challenge remains to translate the \r\nconcepts negotiated and agreements reached in Rio into workable strategies and \r\npolicy measures. Despite the unpromising start, we in the South remain \r\noptimistic that the Horth will honour its commitment to reach the accepted \r\nUnited Hations target of 0.7 per cent of its gross national product for \r\nofficial development assistance, and we hope that those countries which have \r\nnot yet reached that target will augment their aid programmes in order to do \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n69-70 \r\n(Mr. Nyakyi, United Republic \r\nof Tanzania) \r\nso as soon as possible. He welcome the recent initiative by some countries in \r\nthe North to cancel their debts to developing countries. Similarly, we \r\nwelcome the United Nations Development Programme\u0027s innovative mechanism \r\nentitled \"Capacity 21\", aimed at supporting developing countries in their \r\nefforts to implement Agenda 21. We see the mechanism as paving the way for \r\ncreative initiatives by the donor community and multilateral financial \r\ninstitutions as a whole. \r\nPrinciple 4 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development states \r\nthat; \r\n\"In order to achieve sustainable development, environmental \r\nprotection shall constitute an integral part of the development process \r\nand cannot be considered in isolation from it.\" \r\nToday, nearly half of the people of Africa live in abject poverty. The number \r\nof the poor in Africa is projected to increase by more than 100 million by the \r\nend of the century, at a time when the number of the poor in the entire world \r\nis expected to decline by 400 million. This will mean that by the end of the \r\ncentury Africa will account for more than 30 per cent of all the poor of the \r\ndeveloping world. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n71 \r\n(Mr. Nyakyi. United Republic \r\nof Tanzania) \r\nThis is an emergency situation. In relation to Africa, when we talk \r\nabout combating poverty, organizing the transfer of resources and technology, \r\nassisting in capacity-building, protecting and promoting human health and \r\npromoting sustainable human settlement, we are talking of things that should \r\nhappen now. The real work must begin now in order to ensure that the two \r\nyears\u0027 difficult negotiations are converted into constructive action. As \r\nPrime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of Horway rightly stated at Rio, \r\n\"Poverty degrades not only those who suffer it but also those who \r\ntolerate it.\" \r\nThe mandate that is given in paragraph 38.12 of Agenda 21 to the General \r\nAssembly at its forty-seventh session places on this body a heavy \r\nresponsibility - namely, to determine specific organizational modalities for \r\nthe work of the high-level Commission on Sustainable Development. The \r\nattention of Governments, experts, non-governmental organizations and all \r\nothers who participated in the UHCED process is firmly focused on our \r\ndeliberations and conclusions at this session of the General Assembly, and it \r\nshould be our endeavour to ensure that we meet their expectations. As \r\nAgenda 21 is expected both to address the pressing problems of today and to \r\nprepare the world for the challenges of the next century, the post-UHCED \r\ninstitutional framework that we are in the process of creating should embody \r\nthe dynamism and flexibility necessary to last through the twenty-first \r\ncentury. \r\nMy delegation believes that, following UNCED, the United Hations has a \r\nunique opportunity to assume a leadership role in advancing the process of \r\nintegrating environment and development in order to attain sustainable \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n72 \r\n(Mr. Nyakyi, United Repuhlir \r\nof Tanzania) \r\ndevelopment. We are embarking on the task of creating a post-UHCED \r\ninstitutional framework at an opportune time a time when the United Hations \r\nis undergoing a process of restructuring and revitalization in the economic, \r\nsocial and related fields. As the only universal and democratic \r\nintergovernmental Organization capable of playing a pivotal role in \r\ncoordinating the macroeconomic policies of Member States at the global level, \r\nas embodied in the Charter, the United Hations can make a decisive \r\ncontribution to the successful implementation of Agenda 21. \r\nThe post-UHCED institutional framework should be used as a means of \r\nstriving to strengthen the United nations system so that it is not \r\nmarginalized or denied its proper role as the international community\u0027s \r\npre-eminent deliberative and legislative body. After the collapse of the cold \r\nwar, which for nearly 50 years paralysed the Organization\u0027s machinery, the \r\nUnited Hations can now start not only to play the role envisaged in the \r\nCharter with regard to conflict management and the provision of humanitarian \r\nassistance but also to discharge its Charter functions in the economic, social \r\nand related spheres. \r\nWe could not agree more fully with the former UHCED Secretary-General\u0027s \r\ncomment that the fact that the Earth Summit - the largest-ever gathering of \r\nHeads of State or Goveriunent - was convened by the United nations is of \r\nprofound significance. That it marks a turning-point in the history of the \r\nUnited Nations system justifies recognition of the United Nations as the only \r\nforum where the world community can unite for the common good. My delegation \r\nlooks forward to cooperating with other delegations to ensure that this \r\nmomentum is not lost. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n73 \r\n(Mr. Hyakyi, United Republic \r\nof Tanzania) \r\nAgenda 21 indicates keen consciousness of the fact that both economic \r\npolicies of individual countries and international economic relations have \r\ngreat relevance to sustainable development. It is also clear that sound \r\nmacroeconomic and environmental policies have a positive environmental \r\nimpact. A large number of developing countries, including Tanzania, are \r\nundertaking structural adjustment and other reforms. The process of \r\nintegrating environmental components into our national planning system is \r\nongoing. But the international climate has continued to be unpromising for \r\ndeveloping countries as interest rates have remained high and as commodity \r\nprices, in real terms, have fallen to their lowest level since the great \r\ndepression of the 1930s. \r\nThe external debt of developing countries continues to weigh negatively, \r\nand servicing it has led to the perverse phenomenon of the reverse flow of \r\nresources from the developing world to the developed countries. Improvement, \r\nas gauged by such indicators as life expectancy and infant mortality, has \r\nslowed down. Education and health programmes have been adversely affected by \r\neconomic difficulties and by the need for cuts in public expenditure as a part \r\nof adjustment programmes. \r\nThe Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which started in \r\n1986, has not made much progress. A successful conclusion to the Uruguay \r\nRound could do much to improve the international-trade environment and \r\ncontribute to economic recovery. A more open, transparent and rule-based \r\nsystem would help to provide developing countries with better market access \r\nand increased opportunity for export growth. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n74 \r\n(Mr. Hyakyi. United Repuhlir \r\nof Tanzania) \r\nThe General Assembly has a responsibility at this session to establish an \r\nintergovernmental negotiating committee for the elaboration of an \r\ninternational convention to combat desertification in those countries \r\nparticularly countries in Africa that are experiencing serious drought or \r\ndesertification. We have come a long way, through tedious negotiations, to \r\nthe present happy stage of establishing an intergovernmental negotiating \r\ncommittee. It is our sincere hope that the convention will be finalized by \r\nthe target date of 1994. We request the Secretary-General to establish as \r\nsoon as possible, for the purpose of maintaining the momentum, an ad hoc \r\nsecretariat to assist the intergovernmental negotiating committee in the \r\npursuit of its mandate. We also urge relevant organizations in the United \r\nHations system that deal with drought, desertification and development to \r\nshare their knowledge and experience with the committee. \r\nI should like at this juncture to turn to the modalities for the \r\nestablishment of the high-level Commission on Sustainable Development. The \r\npurpose of designating the Commission as a high-level body was, first, to \r\nestablish that the proposed institution would be strong, effective and capable \r\nof carrying out its functions as envisaged in Agenda 21 and, secondly, to \r\nensure that representation would be at the highest possible level. We \r\nunderstand that it may not be possible for countries, especially developing \r\ncountries, to be represented at ministerial level in all the Commission\u0027s \r\ndeliberations, but every effort should be made to ensure representation at the \r\nhighest possible level. This will greatly facilitate and speed up the work of \r\nthe Commission and will make possible the quick implementation of its \r\ndecisions by the avoidance of tedious bureaucratic red tape. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n75 \r\n(Mr. Hyakyi. United Republic \r\nof Tanzania) \r\nMembership of the Commission should take account of the great importance \r\nattached to its mandate and of the unprecedented interest that its work has \r\naroused among the Members of the United Hations. Anything less than the \r\nmaximum permitted under Article 68 would not be adequate. In accordance with \r\nestablished practice, membership should be based on the principle of equitable \r\ngeographical distribution. We also agree with the view, expressed by the \r\nSecretary-General in his report, that the Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment should encourage the participation of non-governmental \r\norganizations, including industry and the business and scientific communities, \r\nin accordance with the rules and procedures adopted during the UNCED process. \r\nMy delegation welcomes the proposal for the establishment of a high-level \r\nadvisory body on sustainable development consisting of eminent persons. He \r\nbelieve that that body too should be appointed on the basis of equitable \r\ngeographical distribution, taking into account the need for broad knowledge \r\nand experience of environmental and development issues. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n76 \r\n(Mr. Hyakyi, United Repuhlir \r\nof Tanzania) \r\nnoting the important role of women in development and therefore their \r\nindispensable contribution to successful implementation of Agenda 21, my \r\ndelegation believes that the Assembly has an obligation to ensure a realistic \r\ngender balance and not merely go in for tokenism in regard to the composition \r\nof the Commission on Sustainable Development, the high-level advisory body and \r\nthe Commission\u0027s secretariat. \r\nBesides generally monitoring progress in the implementation of Agenda 21, \r\nthe Commission should have as its main functions reviewing progress in the \r\nimplementation of the commitments in Agenda 21, including those related to \r\nprovision of financial resources and transfer of technology, and regularly \r\nreviewing the adequacy of funding and mechanisms, including efforts to reach \r\nthe agreed objectives of Agenda 21. \r\nThe Commission on Sustainable Development should ensure effective \r\nfollow-up to UHCED and provide an essential forum for on-going Horth-South \r\ndialogue on environment and development issues. The Commission should \r\nconsider reports and information provided by Governments, international \r\ninstitutions and United Hations agencies regarding their activities to \r\nimplement Agenda 21 and the problems they face. It should also be in a \r\nposition to review the operations and activities of the United Hations \r\nspecialized agencies, including the Bretton Hoods institutions, and of trade \r\nand related conferences, and it must be able to recommend action on the basis \r\nof these reports. \r\nLast but not least, the Commission\u0027s operations must be transparent, \r\naccessible and accountable to United Nations Member States and the public at \r\nthe national, regional and international levels. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n77 \r\n(Mr. Nyakyi. United Republic \r\nof Tanzania) \r\nOur journey to Rio and deliberations at the Earth Summit were extremely \r\nsuccessful. In setting out on the road from Rio, we have no option but to \r\nimplement effectively chapter 33 relating to financial resources and \r\nmechanisms, and chapter 34, on the transfer of environmentally sound \r\ntechnology and capacity-building, of Agenda 21. It is our sincere hope that \r\nat the conclusion of our deliberations on this agenda item, we may have a \r\nsense of the terrain through which the road from Rio will take us. \r\nMr. KARUKUBIRO KAMUHAHHIRE (Uganda): The Earth Summit recently \r\nconcluded in Rio de Janeiro laid down important areas of commitment in the \r\nfield of environment and development. The Assembly at this forty-seventh \r\nsession is expected to put in place the necessary institutional mechanism to \r\nfollow up the achievements of that Summit and look into possible ways of \r\nmaking further progress. The United Hations and its family of agencies are \r\nthus expected to lead the way forward, to ensure that the goals of Rio are \r\nachieved. \r\nAgenda 21 stands as the most comprehensive framework for attaining the \r\nobjective of sustainable development. It responds to the understanding that \r\nour planet Earth can no longer sustain a human species caught between the \r\ndesperation of the poor, whose bid to survive drives them towards its \r\ndestruction, and the unrestrained appetite of the rich, whose consumption \r\npatterns have become unsustainable. The clarion call from Agenda 21 is that \r\nall nations of the world must now join in a global partnership for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The focus from now on must be on sustainability and continuity. \r\nIn Rio, from the perspective of developing countries came the objectives \r\nof reducing poverty, attaining economic growth and managing the environment. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n78 \r\n(Mr. Karukubiro Kamunanwiry, \r\nUganda) \r\nThe thrust of Agenda 21 is that measures adopted to protect the environment \r\nshould not be at the expense of the development process. Developing countries \r\nmust have the legitimate right to utilize their natural resources for their \r\nown development. Preservation of the ecosystem and the promotion of concerted \r\nmanagement of sustainable development must go hand in hand. This means that \r\nenvironmental questions must be integrated into the broader issue of \r\nsustainable development in its social and economic sense. This also calls for \r\na new responsibility: while we set out on the path of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, we should also take cognizance of the impact of our policies that \r\nmight be detrimental to those around us and beyond. \r\nIn developing countries the difficulty in coping with environmental \r\nproblems has been exacerbated by poverty, natural disasters, such as the \r\ndrought and famine which have brought havoc to most parts of southern and \r\neastern Africa, with disastrous consequences for crops and with loss of life, \r\nexemplify our incapacity to cope with these problems. This terrible \r\nincapacity, coupled with lack of awareness of the inevitable consequences of \r\nexhausting our fragile resources, have been in part responsible for the \r\necological disasters. \r\nIn our case, therefore, given the over-reliance of our economies on \r\nagriculture, the case can be made that the concept of sustainable development \r\nfor the present can only start from the application of sustainable \r\nagricultural productivity. Agricultural production can be sustained on a \r\nlong-term basis only if the resource base land, water and forests - is not \r\ndegraded. Agricultural production should then be able to rediversify into new \r\ncrops and new agro-industries. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n79-80 \r\n(Mr. Karukubiro Kamunanwire. \r\nUganda) \r\nIt follows, therefore, that human resource capabilities necessary for \r\nimplementation of sustainable development programmes must be one of the top \r\npriorities. Practical steps to provide access to environmentally efficient \r\ntechnologies will be a necessary complement to this critical area and must be \r\ngiven equal priority. International cooperation is required to assist \r\ndeveloping countries in the framework of meeting the demands of Agenda 21. \r\nThe larger question, however, still remains: how can developing \r\ncountries be expected to cope with the myriad environmental problems facing \r\ntheir fledgling economies? Sub-Saharan Africa is the region with the highest \r\nper capita debt ratio in the world. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n81 \r\n(Mr. Karukubiro Kamunanwire, \r\nUganda) \r\nDebt-servicing alone has come to penalize the region\u0027s economic growth \r\nand its capacity to protect the environment. As a result, it is not uncommon \r\nto see natural resources being overexploited in order to increase production \r\nin the effort to get export earnings to pay for the unending debts. \r\nIt is therefore evident that implementation of the programmes under \r\nAgenda 21 will require enormous resources. Yet throughout the UHCED process \r\nand out of Rio, no clear commitment has emerged in this critical area so far. \r\nIt should be pointed out that the pledge to commit 0.7 percent of gross \r\nnational product to development assistance was actually first made in 1980, \r\nalmost 12 years ago, and has since been repeated year after year. Only a few \r\ndevoted countries have been able to demonstrate their commitment to assisting \r\ndeveloping countries since this pledge was made. But for the majority of the \r\ndeveloped countries in a position to assist, if the pledge made in 1980 has \r\nremained largely unfulfilled, how can we be sure that this will now be \r\nhonoured and met by the year 2000, as was pledged in Rio de Janeiro? \r\nThose who have indicated that they will pay their contributions through \r\nthe Global Environment Facility will be missing the mark. It is now a matter \r\nof common knowledge that most of the programmes under Agenda 21 could not \r\npossibly fit into the constitution of the Global Environment Facility. \r\nEssentially, if the goals of Agenda 21 are to be met, it will be necessary for \r\nthe Global Environment Facility to be restructured so as to meet both the \r\nreguirements of Agenda 21 and the format of representation. \r\nAs constituted today, governance and management of the Global Environment \r\nFacility is hardly representative of developing countries. Its method of \r\noperation has yet to be made transparent. Fundamentally, there is need to \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n82 \r\n(Mr. Karukubiro Kamunanwire, \r\nUganda) \r\nreview its criteria for selecting programmes if the programmes of Agenda 21 \r\nare to fit in its scheme of funding. The Global Environment Facility must \r\ntherefore do more to demonstrate its commitment in fulfilment of the \r\nprovisions of Agenda 21. \r\nImplementation of Agenda 21 is going to be a country-driven process. \r\nMany developing countries are now in the process of drawing up their action \r\nplans for the implementation of Agenda 21, which will involve drawing up \r\npriorities and time-tables for their implementation. Given the conditions of \r\nabject poverty and chronic deprivation in many developing countries, \r\nespecially in sub-Saharan Africa, there is no way countries of the region can \r\nbe expected to come up with resources of their own for the implementation of \r\nthe programmes of Agenda 21. Hew and additional funding will be required to \r\nsupport developing countries in their efforts to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment, and to be able to participate meaningfully in measures to obviate \r\nglobal risks. \r\nIt is in this regard that Uganda wishes to reiterate here what we have \r\noften stated in different forums that the starting-point for the raising of \r\nfinancial resources for Agenda 21 must be a programme that will release \r\nresources from these categories: first, the cancellation of all official \r\nbilateral debts; secondly, the cancellation of all commercial debts procured \r\nunder arrangements of import-export guarantees; and, thirdly, with the support \r\nof donor countries, the cancellation of all debt owed to multilateral \r\nfinancial institutions, which for countries in sub-Saharan Africa constitute \r\nthe bulk of external indebtedness. These actions should be complemented by \r\nthe provision of new and additional resources for the implementation of \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n83 \r\n(Mr. Karukubiro Kamunanwir^^ \r\nUganda) \r\nAgenda 21. These measures will no doubt provide resources for a head-start in \r\nthe implementation of Agenda 21. \r\nThis forty-seventh session of the General Assembly was mandated to set up \r\na high-level commission on sustainable development that will oversee the \r\nimplementation of programmes under Agenda 21. The most critical element for \r\nthe yet to be established commission will be its coordinating functions. The \r\nUnited Nations system must play a leading role by ensuring that its various \r\nbodies and agencies cooperate in an integrated way in the implementation of \r\nthe programmes of Agenda 21. \r\nTo be able to function effectively, the Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment will need to be supported by a strong and effective secretariat. \r\nThe secretariat will have to be headed by a person of sufficient knowledge and \r\nseniority, appointed by the Secretary-General. \r\nA lot of hope is therefore pinned on the Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment yet to be established. Through it, we hope to see Agenda 21 \r\nimplemented with vigour and vitality in the integration of environment and \r\ndevelopment. \r\nMr. KOKEYEV (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): In \r\nthe wake of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development \r\n(UHCED), which was called for, and which became a watershed in the life of the \r\ninternational community, for the first time we are to address environment \r\nissues in the context of sustainable development, giving questions related to \r\nprotection of the environment priority, instead of treating them as ancillary \r\nmatters, and integrating them into all areas of United Hations activities. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n84-85 \r\n(Mr. Kokeyev, Russian Federation) \r\nAs this debate confirms, it is no secret that the results of the \r\nRio de Janeiro forum are viewed with different degrees of optimism in \r\ndifferent countries, which is only natural. Diversity of opinion is an \r\nessential element of a creative search for consensus and its practical \r\nimplementation. In Rio a sound foundation was laid for a complex and lengthy \r\nprocess of harmonizing the movements of States through unexplored terrain \r\ntowards the historically unprecedented objective of sustainable development as \r\nboth a prerequisite for, and the final objective of, the strengthening of \r\nuniversal security, of a new partnership now at last being removed from the \r\ntethers of polemics and ideology. \r\nThe large picture can only be seen from a distance. Less than five \r\nmonths after the Conference, I am sure that the scale of its achievements has \r\nnot yet been fully comprehended. But even now one can see that a code of \r\nrules of sustainable development has emerged in the form of the \r\nRio Declaration. Hhile perhaps the text itself may not be sufficiently \r\npolished due to lack of time, the work proposed by the Secretary-General in \r\nhis Rio address may well be continued with a view to its completion in time \r\nfor the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. It is important that \r\nthese efforts be generated in advance, on a well thought-through \r\norganizational and practical basis. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n86 \r\n(Mr. Kokeyev, Russian Federation) \r\nFurther, we now have Agenda 21 embodying a concrete programme of joint \r\naction by States in the interests of sustainable development. This programme \r\ndefines both the most important tasks and directions of cooperation and the \r\ntechnological, financial and organizational mechanisms for implementing it. \r\nObviously, success will depend, decisively, on efforts at the national level; \r\nbut for the first time it has become possible to integrate these efforts into \r\neconomic policies at all levels. \r\nI would also like to emphasize that we attach special importance to \r\ncoordination of existing and new mechanisms, to ensure that in practice \r\nsustainable development and environmental issues are brought from the fringes \r\nto the forefront of the activities of the United Hations, its General Assembly \r\nand the Economic and Social Council. \r\nThe United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development, with a \r\nsecretariat to which clear functions are assigned and adequate personnel and \r\nresources allocated, should become an important instrument for evaluating the \r\nimplementation of the Rio decisions and for continuing dialogue initiated at \r\nthe Conference. To ensure the effective work of the Commission, it is \r\nimportant to maintain the momentum built up during preparation for the \r\nConference. Establishing the optimal organizational framework for the \r\nCommission\u0027s future effective work is one of the cardinal tasks before the \r\nAssembly under this agenda item. The Secretary-General\u0027s report and his \r\nstatement in this forum contain very interesting and wise considerations to \r\nthis effect and\u0027should be heeded in our work. \r\nIt would also be useful, in our opinion, to take a decision in principle \r\non putting the work of the Environmental Centre for Urgent Assistance onto a \r\npermanent basis. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n87 \r\n(Mr. Kokeyev, Russian Federation) \r\nThe scope of global environmental issues covered by international legal \r\nagreements has expanded significantly. Conventions on climate and biological \r\ndiversity have been signed, reflecting the interests of all countries, \r\nincluding those with transitional economies. Principles governing the \r\nmanagement, preservation and development of all types of forests have been \r\nagreed upon with a view to concluding a relevant convention. Preparations \r\nhave been initiated for negotiations on a convention on combating \r\ndesertification. There is another factor too. The new global partnership \r\nthat was born in Rio has already encompassed the interaction of governmental \r\nand non-governmental structures, joint efforts aimed at promoting \r\nenvironmental education with the wide and active participation of all major \r\npopulation groups. \r\nThus the Rio Conference has accomplished much the maximum possible in \r\ntoday\u0027s circumstances, it might be said and the pivotal task is perceived to \r\nlie in managing this formidable treasure pragmatically, without a maximalist \r\n\"all-or-nothing\" approach, without egoism, prejudice and suspicion, but with a \r\nreadiness to bolster the concept and practices of sustainable that is, \r\nenvironmentally feasible development. \r\nRussia, despite all the difficulties of its transition to a market \r\neconomy, has demonstrated such readiness. A new confirmation of this is to be \r\nfound in the \"National Report on the Condition of the Environment of the \r\nRussian Federation in 1991\", recently published in Moscow. \r\nOne of the features of the report is its impartiality. The document \r\npoints openly to the unsatisfactory condition of the human environment in \r\nRussia. Environmental deterioration, in particular contamination by harmful \r\nsubstances, continues. The report states that the substantial decline in \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n88 \r\n(Mr. Kokeyev, Russian Federatign) \r\nproduction in 1991 has not resulted in an adequate improvement of the \r\nenvironmental situation. In 84 Russian cities, repeatedly and sometimes \r\nregularly, atmospheric contamination levels were recorded at a level 10 or \r\nmore times higher than the maximum concentration allowed by sanitary norms. \r\nToday, critical ecological conditions prevail in 13 regions, with a total area \r\nof 2.5 million square kilometers, or almost 15 per cent of Russia\u0027s territory. \r\nHowever, another virtue of the report is that it is not restricted simply \r\nto recording existing problems. The document objectively describes the \r\ngrowing number of positive signs that are mostly associated with the adoption \r\non 19 December 1991 of the comprehensive market-oriented law \"On the \r\nprotection of the natural environment\". The introduction by the Russian \r\nGovernment of fines for polluting the environment has heightened the role of \r\nenvironmental criteria applicable to norms and standards that are a vital part \r\nof the mechanism ensuring the efficient implementation of environmental \r\nprotection legislation. To monitor the implementation of this legislation, \r\nmore than 267,000 enterprises and organizations were screened last year. \r\nThe same spirit of balanced and thoughtful analysis permeates \r\nenvironmental forecasts aimed at taking appropriate preventive measures. The \r\nproposed complex of priority measures legal, organizational and economic \r\nintended to prevent a worsening of the environmental situation in the country \r\nduring the next two or three years is designed to create an efficient legal \r\nand economic basis for strengthening environmental security. The task is set \r\nto work out a new State policy to lay an efficient foundation for stable \r\neconomic development based on the maintenance of the required parameters of \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n89 \r\n(Mr. Kokeyev. Russian Federation) \r\nthe natural environment and a careful use of natural resources. Among the \r\nmain lines of this policy is the elaboration of a new legal and economic \r\nmechanism for governing the interaction between State bodies at various levels \r\nand users of natural resources, as well as the inclusion of environmental \r\nrequirements in assessing the social and economic efficiency and consequences \r\nof managerial decisions. A series of measures are envisaged to ensure \r\nenvironmental safety on local, regional and global levels in full accordance \r\nwith international agreements and conventions in force. The document proposes \r\nto initiate the elaboration and implementation of ad hoc State programmes of \r\nenvironmental protection and efficient use of natural resources; it recognizes \r\nthe active participation of all strata of the population and all social groups \r\nin the environmentalization of the economic reforms under way as an absolute \r\ncondition of the efficient implementation of environmental policy. The task \r\nis set to elaborate an efficient mechanism to implement the right of each \r\ncitizen and I stress, each citizen to participate in the adoption of \r\ndecisions that affect his or her interests; to receive compensation for health \r\ndamage due to environmental pollution or other harmful effects; and to receive \r\nswift, accurate and analytical information on the state of the natural \r\nenvironment and on the quality of drinking water and food products. \r\nIt is not difficult to see that the measures envisaged are fully \r\ncompatible with the recommendations of the United Hations Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development, with the letter and spirit of the Rio \r\nDeclaration, with Agenda 21; they form a natural part of our resolve to \r\nimplement the recommendations of this forum. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n90 \r\n(Mr. Kokeyev, Russian Federatinn) \r\nThe understanding and solidarity of the international community and a \r\nfavourable attitude on its part towards our problems, requirements and \r\ncapacities in the period of transition are of especial importance to us in the \r\nrealization of these endeavors. The Russian delegation will do everything at \r\nthis session to strengthen the new global partnership, to imbue it with more \r\nconcrete meaning and to transform it into the driving force of qualitatively \r\nnew United Nations activities in the economic, environmental and social \r\nfields. \r\nWe are grateful to all the enthusiasts of the Earth Summit, including the \r\nsecretariat of the Conference. In particular we salute its Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Morris Strong, who is also a special adviser to the Administrator of the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme and head of the prominent company \r\nOntario-Hydro for his steadfast and active commitment to the ideals of our \r\nOrganization. \r\nThis is a further manifestation of the unity between word and deed, \r\nbetween the concept and the practice of sustainable development. It is such \r\nunity that is capable of ensuring the implementation of the greatest possible \r\nproportion of Agenda 21, even in this century, of making sustainable \r\ndevelopment a reality and of bringing closer the time when the great \r\nachievements in the field of environmental protection and development, as a \r\nvaluable contribution to the strengthening of peace, will be assessed by the \r\nworld community at their true value and will come to the notice of the Nobel \r\nPrize Committee. When this will happen depends on all of us, in my opinion. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n91 \r\nMr. ELIASHIV (Israel); Our delegation joins in the debate to \r\nexpress its great interest in the follow-up of the United Hations Conference \r\non Environment and Development (UHCED). We look forward to the concrete \r\nresults of these deliberations and their implementation, which should meet the \r\naspirations of mankind. \r\nWe have read the comprehensive reports of UHCED and of the \r\nSecretary-General, and we listened with great interest to the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s incisive statement focusing on the crucial issues before \r\nus as well as on the restructuring of the United nations system. \r\nIsrael brings to this dialogue its belief in the frontier direction of \r\nhuman history, its conviction that progress and sustainable development, not \r\npredetermined repetition, is the law of life. \r\nIt has been our view for many years now that the gap in standards and \r\ncapacities between the rich and poor nations is still a greater threat to \r\nuniversal peace and a stronger affront to man\u0027s dignity than any threat \r\narising from the admitted neglect of ecological prudence and restraint. Our \r\nsolutions must come to terms with industrialization and technical advances. \r\nThe scientific inheritance is not going to be the monopoly of those countries \r\nwhich are fortunate. The aim is to find a positive reconciliation between \r\ndevelopment and the preservation of man\u0027s natural legacy. \r\nThere can be no real, long-term solution to the poverty problem unless \r\nenvironmental concerns are properly integrated into all development \r\nactivities. A global, integrated approach should encompass human development, \r\nprotection of the environment, social and demographic problems, vocational \r\ntraining, health and education for all, transfer of technology and eradication \r\nof poverty. This inextricable link between environment and sustainable \r\ndevelopment was indeed recognized in Rio. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n92 \r\n(Mr. Eliashiv. Israel) \r\nIn Stockholm 20 years ago the United nations Conference on the Human \r\nEnvironment aroused impressive universal ecological awareness. The Earth \r\nSummit in Rio marks the beginning of action. The main success of Rio lies in \r\nthe fact that it managed to lay down new important commitments for environment \r\nand development cooperation. As was strongly emphasized in Rio, the \r\nenvironment is an integral part of sustainable development and cannot be \r\nviewed in isolation. \r\nAgenda 21 certainly opened up new vistas for attaining the objective of \r\nsustainable development. It is incumbent upon us to continue to build on the \r\nmomentum of international cooperation on the environment and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We must create a new sense of partnership for the future. We \r\nmust translate the words of the Agenda into deeds. We owe it to our children \r\nand grandchildren. A great deal of responsibility lies with the new \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development, which is to be established to become a \r\nprimary forum for international cooperation and action. \r\nIsrael is especially sensitive to the fragility of the environment and \r\ndevelopment, because our country\u0027s rebirth is a continuous ecological drama of \r\nrehabilitating a scarred, eroded, denuded landscape, of redeeming fertile \r\nvalleys degraded into buzzing malarial swamps, and of reversing the rapacity \r\nand neglect which had created the desert. \r\nThere are few examples in the literature of national movements of such \r\ncompassion for a suffering landscape. This solicitude is deepened by a \r\nreligious tradition which thousands of years ago enacted laws that land should \r\nlie fallow every seventh year and that domestic animals should be the objects \r\nof humane care. In our own day Israel, which now uses 100 per cent of its \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n93 \r\n(Mr. Eliashiv. Israel) \r\navailable fresh water, has given a unique emphasis to conservation, \r\npurification and desalination under strict centralized control. \r\nBut the central gift of Israel\u0027s experience to the hope of environmental \r\nimprovement lies in the Negev adventure. Believing that the desert is man\u0027s \r\ncreation and not the inexorable decree of history, we have launched a campaign \r\nagainst aridity with results that are being shared with other nations of the \r\nworld. We can avoid each other\u0027s errors and emulate each other\u0027s successes. \r\nNothing is more urgent than a programme of environmental information, \r\ncompilation, dissemination and monitoring under international auspices. \r\nNearly every problem has a possible technological or scientific solution, \r\nprovided that there is a desire to solve it and to make financial means \r\navailable. Solutions are viable only if they are conceived and put into \r\neffect on a global scale. The United Nations may recapture much of its \r\nprestige and resonance if it gives first priority to those predicaments which \r\nhave global dimensions. \r\nAs the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Israel, Mr. Shimon Peres, said in \r\nhis statement to the General Assembly on 1 October 1992, \r\n\"The United Nations must be the headquarters for an all-embracing \r\nstruggle to safeguard the environment against new threats. It must be a \r\npowerhouse to arrest starvation.\" (A/47/PV.20, p. 46) \r\nIndeed, it seems that as a result of a world-wide concern it has finally been \r\nestablished that the environment is no longer an exclusive item on the agenda \r\nof rich nations. Threats to the environment make no distinction between \r\nnations and continents, and in order to combat them successfully a global \r\napproach is necessary. Ho country may be exempt from this effort, and each \r\none, large or small, rich or poor, must contribute in facing the challenge to \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n94-95 \r\n(Mr. Eliashiv. Israel) \r\nthe extent of its capabilities. An overall willingness to share knowledge, \r\nexpertise, experience and resources must also prevail, so as to make this \r\ncampaign for the protection of our planet truly global. \r\nThe Earth Summit in Rio agreed on a framework for global sharing of \r\nresponsibility for the well-being of our planet. While general awareness and \r\npolicies must be outlined on a global level, special importance should be \r\nattributed to regional cooperation in solving the problems of common \r\ninterest. In this respect, the Mediterranean Action Plan, of which we are \r\nproud to be an active member, may serve as an excellent example. Much of what \r\nhas been achieved would not have been possible if dealt with on an individual \r\nnational basis. The shores of Israel and those of other Mediterranean \r\ncountries, to mention just one example, would not have become cleaner without \r\na concerted effort by all Member States. \r\nWe face the challenge of the future with the certainty that protection of \r\nthe environment is not contrary to development, that in fact environment and \r\ndevelopment achievements will be in vain if we are unable to integrate with \r\ndevelopment in all sectors. \r\nTechnology is a key element in sustainable development and it must be \r\ncarefully selected with a view to adapting it to the specific needs of each \r\ndeveloping country. Technological change holds the promise of meaningful \r\nmedium- and long-term programmes towards sustainable development and \r\nenvironment. Research and development in the use of solar energy has been and \r\nis a major field of endeavour in Israel. Solar energy industrialization and \r\nuses of biomass have already been proved cost-effective. We are also \r\nconcentrating on several projects for the utilization of solar energy for \r\nagricultural and industrial purposes. \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n96 \r\n(Mr. Eliashiv, Israel) \r\nAs part of the international effort to protect the environment, a group \r\nof more than a hundred Israeli companies are engaged in extensive research in \r\norder to develop sophisticated and innovative technologies that are \r\nexport-oriented. \r\nA few of the areas of activity are reducing jet-plane noise, devising \r\nanti-pollution measures against chemical gases and biological pollutants, \r\nidentifying poisonous substances in water, improving the removal of oil spills \r\nin the sea and converting crop-sprays into benign materials. \r\nWe believe that such environmental technologies, which we are willing to \r\nshare with other developing countries, could play an important role in the \r\nglobal effort to achieve sustainable development. These interrelated issues \r\nare certainly relevant to the implementation of Agenda 21. \r\nOur research is adapted to the peculiar requirements of our area, and it \r\nis linked to the very extensive development that has taken place in Israel in \r\nthe use of water resources and in processes to desalinate sea water and \r\nbrackish water in the desert. All this research and development, which \r\nincludes the highest degree of water control in the world, is directed towards \r\nturning arid deserts into green, fruitful, food-bearing soil. \r\nDesertification affects the lives and well-being of 2.7 billion people. \r\nAll of us who are concerned about the environment must redouble our efforts to \r\neradicate desertification. It is our belief that today\u0027s scientific skills \r\nand developing technology offer hope of facing this problem and converting \r\narid zones into habitable and productive ones. \r\nThe national Desert Research Institute, at Ben-Gurion University in \r\nIsrael, is engaged in research and development on arid zones and in particular \r\nthe conversion of the desert into a productive environment. The scope of the \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n97 \r\n(Mr. Eliashiv, Israel) \r\nInstitute\u0027s activities transcends Israel\u0027s borders, for much of its research \r\nhas world-wide significance. It is our aim to share our experience and \r\nknow-how with any country. The Middle East possesses vast desert land but \r\nmeagre water resources. The desert can be turned into green, fertile land. \r\nThe experience and technology is available, water can be reused, and new, \r\nfresh water can be produced from the sea. \r\nFrom a historical point of view, man\u0027s endeavours to settle the desert \r\nand his attempts to extract a livelihood from the barren land are as ancient \r\nas man himself. The Biblical Prophet Isaiah gave expression to these \r\nendeavours when he said: \r\n\"The wilderness and the arid land shall be glad; and the desert \r\nshall rejoice, and blossom like the tulip.\" (The Holy Bible, Isaiah 35:11 \r\nIt is obvious that a plan of action on an international scale is needed in \r\norder to combat desertification. Therefore, in this context we welcome the \r\nsuggested establishment of a framework to draft a convention, and we hope that \r\nsuch action will be taken expeditiously. \r\nThe human factor is no less central to development in bringing about the \r\neffective involvement of the population and in implementing national \r\npolicies. Therefore, increased attention will have to be directed to human \r\nresources, sustainable development and the transfer of training and \r\ntechnology. We have placed a great deal of emphasis on the development of \r\nhuman resources, which has become the key to the country\u0027s technological \r\nexpansion and a marked feature of its extensive technical and economic \r\ncooperation with other countries. \r\nThe importance of adequate funding mechanisms cannot be overemphasized, \r\nfor they represent the key to environmental protection. In the past decades \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n98 \r\n(Mr. Eliashiv. Israel) \r\nthe World Bank, the regional development banks and other international \r\ninstitutions have achieved laudable success in promoting development in \r\nagriculture, industry, education, health and social welfare in countless \r\ndeveloping nations. They can exercise the same skill in fostering \r\nenvironmentally sound development. \r\nWe must strengthen the capability of the Global Environment Facility \r\n(GEF) to finance environmental programmes of concern to all nations. The \r\nDecember meeting in Cote d\u0027lvoire should lead to the restructuring of GEF, as \r\nagreed in Rio, to become operational before the end of 1993. \r\nInternational organizations should play a transitional role in the \r\ndeveloping world while the various nations are building a national \r\ninfrastructure for environmental administration. In Rio our delegation \r\nproposed that the United Hations Development Programme network could be \r\ndrafted into the service of the environment, and my delegation is pleased to \r\nnote that the Administrator has already taken action to this effect. \r\nHon-governmental environmental organizations should be given our \r\nsupport. It is our hope that they will continue to serve as catalysts for \r\nenvironmental improvement. \r\nWe welcome the agreement reached in Rio on the institutional arrangements \r\nto follow up UNCED, and in particular the establishment of the Commission on \r\nSustainable Development. Follow-up to UNCED should be fully incorporated into \r\nthe ongoing revitalization of the United Nations economic and social sectors, \r\nthus ensuring that the UHCED recommendations are integrated into the United \r\nNations operational activities. \r\nWe support the view that the central purpose of the Commission should be \r\nto provide an appropriate intergovernmental forum for the exchange of \r\nA/47/PV.55 \r\n99 \r\n(Mr. Eliashiv, Israel) \r\ninformation about national and multilateral experiences. We must ensure not \r\nonly that the Commission will be an efficient and effective body, but also \r\nthat it will represent the national interests of all nations, so as to ensure \r\ngenuine international cooperation. In deciding the composition and membership \r\nof the Commission, we should take into consideration the principle of \r\nuniversality. We support the view that Member States that are not members of \r\nthe Commission should have the right to participate fully in its deliberations \r\nas observers. \r\nAs we have mentioned before, regional cooperation is an essential element \r\nfor the implementation of environmental action. All agree that environmental \r\nproblems know no boundaries; nevertheless, conflicts and disputes all over the \r\nworld prevent genuine cooperation. \r\nThe Middle East holds tremendous potential for economic development. A \r\nvariety of joint and multilateral projects for economic cooperation would be \r\nof mutual benefit and would enhance the well-being of all parties. We are \r\ncurrently engaged in bilateral negotiations to bring an end to the conflicts \r\nof the past and in multilateral negotiations to lay the foundations for the \r\nfuture. \r\nDuring the recent multilateral talks in the framework of the Middle East \r\npeace process, Israel presented detailed and concrete proposals on projects \r\nfor regional cooperation and development in the fields of, inter alia, \r\narid-zone agricultural development, a centre for combating desertification, \r\nalternate sources of energy, desalination technology and protection of the \r\nenvironment. Those projects mean not only cooperation, but also, and above \r\nall, confidence-building and progress towards peace. \r\nA/47/PV. 55 \r\n100 \r\n(Mr. Eliashiv, Israel) \r\nThe Rio Declaration on Environment and Development stipulates in \r\nPrinciple 25 that \r\n\"Peace, development and environmental protection are interdependent and \r\nindivisible.\" \r\nIt is our desire and vision that peace should eventually embrace all \r\nneighbouring countries, so that we can achieve a comprehensive settlement in \r\nour region that will enable us to live together with equality, trust and \r\nmutual respect, thus making it possible for all people and nations in our area \r\nto devote and dedicate their efforts, resources and energies to social and \r\neconomic development through genuine cooperation - for peace and prosperity \r\nare indivisible. \r\nThe meeting rose at 6.30 p.m. \r\n"
