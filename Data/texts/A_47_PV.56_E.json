The United Hations \r\nConference on Environment and Development (UNCED) will undoubtedly go down in \r\nthe annals of history as one of the most remarkable of gatherings in the \r\nmagnitude of its concerns. \r\nThe Rio Conference laid down a conceptual and practical basis for our \r\nfuture endeavours. It also signified the beginning of a new global \r\npartnership. For this we are profoundly indebted to Mr. Maurice Strong, \r\nSecretary-General of UHCED, and Ambassador Tommy Koh of Singapore for their \r\ntireless efforts, dedicated commitment and brilliant leadership during the \r\npreparatory process and the Rio Conference itself. \r\nWe are especially grateful to the Government of Brazil for the excellent \r\narrangements that in no small measure contributed to making that historic \r\nConference a success. \r\nWe also thank the Rapporteur, the Foreign Minister of Algeria, for his \r\nreport on the Rio Conference. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n3 \r\n(Mr. Erdenechuluun. Mongolia) \r\nWe listened with great interest and anticipation to the comprehensive and \r\nthought-provoking statement by the Secretary-General. My delegation commends \r\nhim for the reports concerning the institutional arrangements to follow up \r\nUNED. \r\nThe Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of Pakistan has already spoken \r\non behalf of the Group of 77. Therefore I will confine my remarks to a few \r\npoints of particular interest to my delegation. \r\nThe Rio Declaration, Agenda 21 and all other documents mark a significant \r\nchange in mankind\u0027s attitude towards nature and environment. The Rio \r\nConference has made it distinctly clear that development can no longer be \r\ndivorced from environment. \r\nHaving put this interrelationship at the top of the agenda, the world \r\ncommunity has come to realize that an advance of any given country is \r\nessentially dependent upon the collective efforts of both affluent and \r\ndeveloping nations. \r\nWith the end of the cold war and the diminishing of the threat of direct \r\nmilitary confrontation between major Powers, the environmental problems and \r\ntheir potential catastrophic consequences today represent a greater security \r\nrisk for every nation. It has become incumbent upon each and every country to \r\narticulate its own Agenda 21. \r\nRio has demonstrated anew the unique role of the United Hations, and it \r\nis only here that we can make our joint efforts work. \r\nMongolia shares the considered view of many that the momentum generated \r\nin Rio must not be lost, and that commitment to sustainable development has to \r\nbe translated into practical action. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n4 \r\n(Mr. Erdenechuluun, Mongolia) \r\nThe issue of the highest priority at this session is, of course, the \r\nestablishment of a comprehensive institutional framework to follow up UHCED. \r\nMy delegation is gratified to note that the views of the Secretary-General on \r\nthe procedural and organizational modalities of the proposed Commission on \r\nSustainable Development, which will have a vital role to play in monitoring \r\nand implementing Agenda 21, lay down a sound basis for constructive \r\ndeliberations and early action. \r\nMy delegation is in full agreement with the view of many that the \r\nmembership of the Commission is to be determined on the basis of equitable \r\ngeographical distribution and representation is to be at the highest possible \r\nlevel. In order to ensure that the views of all are adeguately taken into \r\naccount, non-member States should be given an opportunity to participate in \r\nthe work of the Commission as observers. It is also important that the \r\nrelevant intergovernmental organizations, both within and outside the \r\nUnited Hations, as well as non-governmental organizations and private \r\ninstitutions, contribute to the work of the Commission, as envisaged in \r\nAgenda 21. \r\nMy delegation would like to see the new Commission have distinct \r\nfunctions, concrete agendas and an effective organizational structure in order \r\nto avoid duplication of work. \r\nIn addition to its functions foreseen in Agenda 21, the Commission on \r\nSustainable Development will in our view also provide a crucial forum for \r\nongoing Horth-South dialogue on environment and development issues and on the \r\nlinkages between them. Furthermore it will be the most effective mechanism \r\nfor ensuring adherence to the principles of environmentally sound sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n5 \r\n(Mr. Erdenechuluun, Mongolia) \r\nThe success of the UHCED decisions undoubtedly will depend upon the \r\nfinancial commitments of the industrialized countries. It is common knowledge \r\nthat the developing countries will not be able to cope with the multitude of \r\nproblems on their own unless new and additional resources are mobilized. It \r\nis especially related to the need to obtain environmentally sound \r\ntechnologies. We welcome the pledges recently announced by the major \r\nindustrialized countries, as well as those made in Rio. \r\nHe also welcome the process of the restructuring of the Global \r\nEnvironment Facility, and hope that it will give developing countries broader \r\nparticipation in its decision making procedure. \r\nThe United Hations Development Programme (UHDP), on its part, could play \r\nan important role with its unique comparative advantages. We wholeheartedly \r\nwelcome the UHDP\u0027s new \"Capacity 21\", designed to support developing countries \r\nin formulating environmental policies and legislation and creating their \r\nnational technical and administrative structures. \r\nThe United Hations regional commissions have an important role to play in \r\nfacilitating regional and/or subregional cooperation. He believe that \r\ncountries themselves should initiate cooperative action that could result in \r\nthe creation of specific regional and/or subregional mechanisms to deal with \r\nissues related to development and environment. \r\nHe are encouraged by the statement made in Rio by the President of the \r\nWorld Bank on \"Earth increment\". \r\nHe hope that early commitments sufficient to start the speedy \r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 will be made and that political will and a sense \r\nof responsibility will prevail at this session of the General Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n5(a-z) \r\n(Mr. Erdenechuluun, Mongolia) \r\nThe question of particular importance to my delegation is the \r\nestablishment of an open-ended intergovernmental negotiating committee for the \r\nelaboration and adoption of an international convention to combat \r\ndesertification, particularly in Africa, with a view to finalizing such a \r\nconvention by June 1994. \r\nThe report of the Secretary-General in document A/47/393 contains \r\nspecific requirements and arrangements for the implementation of the plan of \r\naction of Agenda 21 in the areas of drought and desertification. \r\nThe severity and immensity of this problem requires of us urgent and \r\ndecisive action at this session of the General Assembly. \r\nThe Government of Mongolia attaches great importance to environmental \r\nissues, and they form an integral part of its socio-economic activities. A \r\nnew Ministry of Environment Protection has been created. The Government\u0027s \r\nenvironmental policy places particular emphasis on the introduction of \r\nenvironmentally sound technology. The newly elected Parliament of Mongolia is \r\nexpected to ratify the Conventions on climate change and biodiversity later \r\nthis year. \r\nIn conclusion, I express my delegation\u0027s hope that our deliberations will \r\nresult in practical actions, and, especially, the setting up of a Commission \r\non Sustainable Development so that it would start substantive work early next \r\nyear. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n6 \r\nMr. OLHAYE (Djibouti); The task before us is daunting as we move \r\nalong the road from Rio in concretizing or translating the accomplishments of \r\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) into real \r\nprogrammes and projects. We cannot afford to fail to devise an effective \r\nfollow-up mechanism along the lines of the firm agenda or the comprehensive \r\nframework we established. \r\nThe euphoria generated as the Earth Summit drew to a close on June 14 \r\nthis year must be kept alive as the beacon of hope against an ecological \r\ncatastrophe. As the visionary, indefatigable UHCED Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Maurice Strong, put it in his closing statement to the Conference: \r\n\"This process has been a profoundly important human experience from \r\nwhich none of us can emerge unchanged. The world will not be the same; \r\ninternational diplomacy and the United Hations will not be the same; and \r\nthe prospects for the Earth\u0027s future cannot be the same.\" \r\nThe excruciating, often long and stifling meetings at Rio eventually \r\nsucceeded in laying down new, far-reaching commitments for international \r\ncooperation in environment and development culminating in the adoption of \r\nImportant policy documents: the Rio Declaration, the statement on forest \r\nprinciples and Agenda 21, perhaps the principal environment and development \r\naction or work plan. \r\nHot every commitment in Agenda 21, however, is hard, conclusive or even \r\ncertain. I refer specifically to the financial resources and transfer of \r\ntechnology mechanisms. Such lingering doubts on the part of the poor nations \r\nof the world are not groundless, given the bitter past experiences of \r\nunfulfilled promises and scuttled expectations. The serious concerns about \r\ndesertification, poverty and other development problems facing poor countries. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n7 \r\n(Mr. Olhaye, Djibouti) \r\nparticularly in Africa, have in the past been invariably overlooked amid all \r\nthe attention devoted to more global environmental problems such as climate \r\nchange and ozone depletion. Lamenting this usual neglect, an African \r\npolicy-maker had to remark: \r\n\"For the majority of African countries daily confronted by the \r\nproblems of thirst and hunger, the struggle against environmental \r\ndegradation is a struggle for survival. For us, the problem of \r\nenvironmental protection is a problem of development, a problem of the \r\nsustainable management of natural resources\". \r\nThe fragile consensus crafted in Rio must not be allowed to fall victim \r\nto renewed rancour, insensitivity or incoherence. Despite the extensive body \r\nof compromises, often short of much substance and political commitments, the \r\nfinal Agenda 21 provides a satisfactory framework for future cooperation. It \r\nhas indeed set the stage for action. Towards this end, the recommendations \r\ncontained in the chapter on international institutional arrangements call for \r\nstrengthening the capacity of the United Nations system itself to address such \r\nchallenges, with the establishment during this session of the General Assembly \r\nof a permanent high-level Commission on Sustainable Devlopment, whose role \r\nwould be: \r\n\"to ensure the effective follow-up of the Conference, as well as to \r\nenhance international cooperation and rationalize the intergovernmental \r\ndecision-making capacity for the integration of environment and \r\ndevelopment issues and to examine the progress in the implementation of \r\nAgenda 21 at the national, regional and international levels\". \r\n(A/CONF.151/26 (Vol, Til), para 38.11) \r\nIn this respect, we welcome the report of the Secretary-General, which \r\nprovides comprehensive recommendations on the shape and scope of the \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n8 \r\n(Mr. Olhaye. Diibouti) \r\nCommission its mandate and functions, composition, funding, secretariat, and \r\ncoordination mechanisms. \r\nThe momentum of Rio ought to be maintained and, therefore, the \r\nestablishment of a strong, versatile Commission with vision and vitality \r\ncannot be overemphasized. The Secretary-General\u0027s keen interest and direct \r\ninvolvement in the functioning of the Commission will immeasurably enhance its \r\neffectiveness. The far-reaching ramifications of the Commission\u0027s mandate, \r\ndescribed as the most challenging of modern human endeavours, will focus in \r\nthe coming months on critical priority issues. Within the ongoing process of \r\nthe United Nations restructuring and revitalization, it is hoped that the \r\nsubstance and mandate of the Commission will not be seriously undermined or \r\nits authority and special status in any way compromised. \r\nAt the centre of the Commission is the question of the new and additional \r\nresources needed to support the wide-ranging programmes envisaged. The \r\ninternational donor community and financial institutions are collectively \r\nurged to heed the call of Agenda 21 for the realization of the official \r\ndevelopment assistance target of 0.7 per cent, for without adeguate commitment \r\nthe implementation process will be seriously jeopardized. \r\nThe earth increment for the tenth replenishment of the International \r\nDevelopment Association covering the period 1993-1995 will definitely provide \r\nan additional volume of resources. Likewise, donor countries need to consider \r\npossible earth increments in the regional development banks in developing \r\ncountries, namely, in Africa, Asia and Latin America, and also in bilateral \r\nassistance programmes. As we look further at the financial follow-up to Rio, \r\nthe envisaged restructuring of the Global Environment Facility must be seen in \r\nperspective, particulary in respect of additional resources for special \r\nenvironmental conventions still to come, such as those on desertification and \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n9-10 \r\n(Mr. Olhaye, Diibouti) \r\nforests. We attach great importance to the creation of an intergovernmental \r\nnegotiating committee to elaborate the convention of the international \r\nframework to combat desertification. \r\nThe new Commission\u0027s central role will be to monitor the implementation \r\nof Agenda 21 by Governments and United Hations agencies. It also calls for \r\nconsideration to be given to the establishment of a high-level advisory board \r\nconsisting of eminent persons knowledgeable about the environment and \r\ndevelopment. When all is said and done, however, the success of the Earth \r\nSummit, as noted by a well-known scholar, would: \r\n\"ultimately be determined not by what was said there but by what \r\ncountries and international agencies did afterwards\". \r\nThe bottom line is money. Lewis Preston of the World Bank summed it up well \r\nat Rio: \r\n\"The question is not whether we can afford to do it. The question is: \r\nCan we afford not to do it?\" \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\nII \r\nMr. SWE (Myanmar); The United Hations Conference on Environment and \r\nDevelopment (UHCED) will be remembered as a defining moment in history. From \r\nthe Rio summit has emerged a global consensus and a political commitment, \r\ntaken at the highest levels, with regard to development and environment \r\ncooperation. The international community is being presented with a historic \r\nopportunity to forge a new and equitable partnership. This opportunity must \r\nnot be lost. We must work together and take necessary follow-up steps so that \r\nthe spirit of Rio will be kept alive and the consensus reached will be given \r\npractical effect. \r\nMuch needs to be done by the Assembly as a follow-up to UNCED. The three \r\ndocuments adopted at the Summit namely, the Rio Declaration, Agenda 21 and \r\nthe Forest Principles provide the broad framework for the global partnership \r\nthat all of us aspire to. These documents, we hope, will be adopted in their \r\nentirety. The Assembly must also determine the specific procedures and \r\norganizational modalities of the Commission on Sustainable Development. In \r\nthis regard let me highlight some areas on which my delegation places special \r\nemphasis. \r\nThe Commission on Sustainable Development should be a functional \r\ncommission of the Economic and Social Council. Hhile it is logical to limit \r\nthe size of the Commission to ensure efficiency, it should be large enough to \r\ntake into account the need for equitable geographical representation. Since \r\nthe Commission stands to benefit from the participation of the entire \r\ninternational community. States Members of the Organization or of its \r\nspecialized agencies that are not members of the Commission should be given \r\nobserver status, enabling them to participate fully and effectively in the \r\ndeliberations of the CommiLSion. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n12 \r\n(Mr. Swe, Myanmar) \r\nThe functions of the Commission should be well defined. In our view \r\nthese should include the following. First, it should monitor progress in the \r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 and activities related to the integration of \r\nenvironment and development goals. Secondly, it should review progress in the \r\nimplementation of the commitments contained in Agenda 21, particularly those \r\nrelated to the provision of financial resources and transfer of technology. \r\nHere let me emphasize that my delegation regards the provision of new, \r\nadequate and additional financial resources and the transfer of technology as \r\ncentral to the effective implementation of Agenda 21. We therefore regard \r\nthis as one of the most important functions of the Commission. Thirdly, it \r\nshould review on a regular basis the adequacy of funding mechanisms, including \r\ntargets where applicable. \r\nWe regard capacity-building, particularly in developing countries, as \r\nextremely important. We should indeed like to see the Commission monitor the \r\nprogress achieved in attaining the objectives regarding capacity-building set \r\nforth in Agenda 21. We should also like to see the envisaged Commission on \r\nSustainable Development forge a strong, interactive relationship with the \r\ninternational financial institutions. It is our hope that the Commission will \r\nmonitor the activities of these institutions in relation to the implementation \r\nof Agenda 21. \r\nAgenda 21 addresses the pressing problems of today and exhorts us to make \r\nnecessary preparations to be equal to the challenges that will face us in the \r\nfuture. It is in fact a blueprint to save planet Earth and it needs the full \r\nsupport of the entire international community. Organs, organizations and \r\nagencies of the United Nations system have a central role to play in support \r\nof Agenda 21. We therefore see merit in the recent decision of the \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n13 \r\n(Mr. Swe, Myanmar) \r\nAdministrative Committee on Coordination to establish an inter-agency \r\ncommittee on sustainable development, entrusting it with the task of \r\nallocating responsibilities for implementing Agenda 21. Efficient \r\ncoordination of the organs, organizations and agencies of the United Nations \r\nsystem for the implementation of Agenda 21 deserves our full support. \r\nHhile the importance of the Commission on Sustainable Development cannot \r\nbe overemphasized, there are other areas of importance which reguire the \r\nattention of the General Assembly. I speak of the establishment of an \r\nintergovernmental negotiating committee for the preparation of an \r\ninternational convention to combat desertification in countries experiencing \r\nserious drought and/or desertification. Given the fact that approximately \r\n3 million people died in the mid-1980s as a result of droughts in sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica, desertification and drought are problems that require the urgent \r\nattention of the international community. \r\nThe commitments made at Rio need to be conscientiously fulfilled by all \r\nif we are to achieve sustainable development for the common good of mankind. \r\nConcrete actions need to be taken at the national, regional and international \r\nlevels. The Chairman of the Myanmar delegation, the Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, who is also the Chairman of the National Commission on Environmental \r\nAffairs of the Union of Myanmar, reiterated in his address to the General \r\nAssembly on 5 October Myanmar\u0027s firm commitment to the cause of environment \r\nand sustainable development and affirmed our readiness to shoulder our \r\nresponsibilities in keeping with the spirit of Rio. \r\nAllow me briefly to apprise the Assembly of our views on environment and \r\nour national endeavours as a follow-up to UNCED. \r\nMyanmar fully subscribes to the concept of sustainable development. A \r\ncentral tenet of this, in our opinion, is the protection and conservation of \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n14-15 \r\n(Mr. Swe, Myanmar) \r\nthe environment in the national endeavour for socio-economic development, \r\ntaking fully into account the twin objectives of environment and development. \r\nIn this endeavour, the living standard of the people, particularly of the \r\nrural population, will be raised through integrated rural-development schemes, \r\nwhile healthy human living conditions will be promoted. Efficient use and \r\nconservation of energy will be promoted. Environmental legislation will be \r\nstrengthened in all pertinent sectors. Public awareness and mass \r\nparticipation will be fostered and stimulated. Forest resources will be \r\nmanaged in a sustainable manner and reforestation and afforestation will be \r\nactively promoted. \r\nWe regard poverty as both the cause and the effect of environmental \r\ndegradation. Poverty alleviation, therefore, figures prominently in our \r\nnational agenda. As part of this agenda, the Government of Myanmar has \r\nembarked on an ambitious Programme for the Development of the Border Areas and \r\nnational Races. The border areas, mostly populated by ethnic national races, \r\nhave traditionally been economically and socially backward owing to difficult \r\ngeographical terrain, poor transport and poor communications. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n16 \r\n(Mr. Swe. Myanmar) \r\nTo remedy this, the Government has initiated an integrated rural \r\ndevelopment programme, which includes infrastructure building, the \r\nintroduction of modern agricultural practices, income-generating schemes and \r\nthe provision of agriculture extension services, health services and education \r\nfacilities. By providing a whole range of economic and social services the \r\nGovernment not only aims at alleviating poverty but also hopes that the \r\nintroduction of modern agricultural practices will do away with the \r\nenvironmentally wasteful method of slash-and-burn agriculture, which endangers \r\nthe fragile ecosystem in these areas. To give renewed impetus to the \r\nprogramme and to administer it, the Government has since the Rio Summit set up \r\na separate ministry. \r\nForests constitute a valuable economic resource for Myanmar. \r\nAccordingly, the sustainable management and conservation of forests occupy a \r\nplace of importance in the national environment policy. Sustainable \r\nproduction of forest resources and conservation of biodiversity are assured by \r\na Forest Working Plan, which is revised every 10 years to sustain the \r\nresilience of the forest ecosystem. Complementing this is an afforestation \r\nprogramme whereby 36,000 hectares are planted annually. This programme has \r\nbeen reinforced by a scheme for planting fast-growing trees for fuel wood. \r\nSince Rio, 11 million trees have been planted countrywide with full public \r\nparticipation. We are also engaging in a nationwide public-awareness campaign \r\nstressing the need to preserve and protect the environment. The Government \r\nhas recently laid down effective measures to increase protected areas \r\nfivefold. Arrangements arr- also well under way to complete the necessary \r\ndomestic procedures for an early ratification of the Conventions on Biological \r\nDiversity and on Climate Change, which we signed at Rio. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n17 \r\n(Mr. Swe, Myanmar) \r\nBefore I conclude, I wish to comment on one of the important documents of \r\nthe Rio Summit the non-legally binding authoritative statement of principles \r\nfor a global consensus on the management, conservation and sustainable \r\ndevelopment of all types of forests. We are proud to be associated with the \r\nefforts which culminated in its adoption, and, as a country rich in forest \r\nresources, we place special emphasis on that document. The forest principles \r\ncontain all the elements necessary for the management, conservation and \r\nsustainable development of forests. In our view, these principles provide an \r\nadequate basis for international cooperation on forests. \r\nThe current session of the General Assembly can make a lasting \r\ncontribution to the cause of sustainable development. It can do much to keep \r\nthe spirit of Rio alive and to build on the political momentum achieved \r\nthere. It is now time for all of us to work together in a cooperative spirit \r\nand to fulfil our commitment in good faith. Then, and only then, can we hope \r\nto have a sustainable future for all of us. \r\nMr. PADILLA (Philippines); The intimate linkages of the various \r\nelements that spell economic well-being or economic deterioration in the world \r\nare well known. Everybody understands, for instance, that the incapacity of \r\ncountries and private firms to negotiate new loans because of their \r\nexternal-debt record limits, their capacity to purchase factories and equipment \r\nthat incorporate new technologies. This limitation constrains them from \r\nproducing competitive export goods. The consequent constriction of income \r\nfrom international trade reduces national budgets. This, and the need to meet \r\nheavy external debt and de\u0027jt-service obligations, severely cripple the \r\ncapacity of developing countries to provide basic services to their peoples. \r\nThis inability to provide for basic needs exacerbates poverty, and poverty \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n18 \r\n(Mr. Padilla. Philippines) \r\ninevitably exacts a great toll on nature. The poor will seek to feed \r\nthemselves and their families by burning forests for tillable land or by \r\nfishing by wantonly destructive means. \r\nWe could go on citing example after example of such intimate linkages of \r\neconomic and social realities. One important linkage that nobody now denies \r\nis that between the environment and development. To say anything more on this \r\nlinkage is to stress the obvious beyond measure. \r\nThe global assertion of that significant interconnection was the raison \r\nd\u0027etre of the unprecedented meeting of world leaders in Rio de Janeiro last \r\nsummer. That was what moved the General Assembly to formulate the monumental \r\nresolution 44/228, which mandated the convocation of the United Nations \r\nConference on Environment and Development (UNCED). That is what is foremost \r\nin our minds now as we discuss the importance of implementing fully, promptly, \r\nand effectively the agreements we reached at Rio. \r\nAt Rio, we signed the framework Conventions on Biodiversity and on \r\nClimate Change. We formulated the principles contained in the Rio \r\nDeclaration. We adopted Agenda 21. Earlier speakers have noted that Rio was \r\na definitive moment in the history of international cooperation. In 1945, we \r\nagreed to seek the means to maintain peace and security in our world. \r\nSubsequently, we adopted a Charter on the rights of men. In Rio, we built on \r\nthese human rights and viewed them in the context of our common heritage and \r\nhome; Mother Earth. \r\nOf the many points we agreed upon at Rio, and which delegation after \r\ndelegation has spoken of since last Monday, the Philippine delegation today \r\nwishes to stress a few: first, the right to development and the human face of \r\ndevelopment; secondly, the categorical imperative of international \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n19-20 \r\n(Mr. Padilla, Philippines) \r\ncooperation; thirdly, the financing of Agenda 21; fourthly, the transfer of \r\ntechnology; and, fifthly, institutional coordination. \r\nUNCED\u0027s recognition of the right to development, we think, was one of \r\nRio\u0027s most important achievements. We believe that the right to development \r\nproceeds very logically from every man\u0027s right to life. If a man has a right \r\nto life, he also has a right to that which preserves and perfects that life. \r\nTo that end, economic and social development should be seen as a sine qua \r\nnon for the preservation and perfection of life. What is true for the \r\nindividual is true for nations. From the human being\u0027s right to life and \r\ndevelopment proceeds the right of peoples and nations to development. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n21 \r\n(Mr. Padilla. Philippines) \r\nHe are pleased to note that the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 manifest a \r\nhuman-centered approach to development. Not too long ago, I am told, there \r\nwere some in the United Nations who wanted to view economic issues from a \r\npurely economic perspective. They felt that any explicit expression of man\u0027s \r\ncentral role in development was an unwelcome intrusion of the philosophical \r\ninto the purity of economic theory. This view could not be farther from \r\nreality. Economics is a man-centred discipline. Finance, trade, investment, \r\ndebt relief: all these issues become meaningless without reference to the \r\nindividual human being. \r\nThe International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Hations \r\nDevelopment Decade was a milestone in development thinking. The Strategy is \r\nbased upon the importance of man in all development. \r\nHe in the Philippines are convinced of the paramount importance of the \r\nhuman being in the hierarchy of political, social and economic values. We \r\nfeel that in any conflict that could possibly arise, involving a choice \r\nbetween men and the environment, our unqualified choice would be for the human \r\nbeing. We should therefore strive to prevent such critical choices from ever \r\nhaving to be made. \r\nI turn to the subject of international cooperation. Man is not only at \r\nthe centre of all development efforts; he is also the fundamental objective of \r\nall international cooperation, be it cooperation for international peace and \r\nsecurity or cooperation for economic growth and development. Incidentally, \r\nthe distinction that I have just made fades in the light of another truth we \r\nhold dear, that there can be no true peace and security in our world without \r\neconomic and social development. Pope Paul VI\u0027s words have been quoted \r\noften: \"Peace has a new name; development.\" We cooperate not only for the \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n22 \r\n(Mr. Padilla, Philippine^) \r\nwelfare of nations and States, but ultimately for the people, the human \r\nbeings, who make up these nations and States. \r\nLet those great countries blessed by God with political might and \r\neconomic power realize that their achievements are due to the talent, industry \r\nand dedication of the individual men and women in various disciplines from \r\nagriculture to finance, from scientific theory to applied technology, from \r\nfactories to universities. Let them recognize that when they sit down to \r\nformulate macroeconomic policies for their countries they are inevitably also \r\ntouching on the lives of millions of other human beings throughout the world. \r\nSuch is the magnitude of their responsibility that they should not be remiss \r\nand wanting in hiiman compassion. \r\nLet me say, however, that the statements in this debate of the \r\nrepresentatives of the European Community and Japan, the United States and \r\nother industrialized countries show that there is compassion, there is \r\nconcern, there is a momentum of cooperation. The momentum generated by UNCED \r\nshould not be lost. \r\nThere is a need for international cooperation to follow up the decisions \r\nand agreements reached in UHCED, not only for those issues specifically \r\nmentioned in chapter 2 of Agenda 21, \"International cooperation to accelerate \r\nsustainable development...\", but also for the implementation of all the \r\ncommitments of the Rio Declaration, all the programmes incorporated in the 40 \r\nchapters of Agenda 21 and all the provisions of the Conventions on \r\nbiodiversity a»d climate change. \r\nCooperation, of course, begins with the fulfilment of one\u0027s specific \r\nduties at home. Formulating sound policies and managing their implementation \r\nare of such obvious importance that they hardly need mentioning. But there is \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n23 \r\n(Mr. Padilla, Philippines) \r\nobviously a need to concentrate on certain habits and traditional actions that \r\nhave been described in Agenda 21 as unsound, such as unsustainable patterns of \r\nconsumption, which exhaust nature, and of production, which pollute and \r\ndegrade the environment. \r\nBesides action on these points, which can be addressed domestically, \r\nthere is a need for thoughtful, serious, politically willed cooperation in \r\nbreaking down unreasonable trade barriers, promoting capital formation through \r\ndirect foreign investments and establishing definitive solutions to the \r\nexternal debt problem. These matters cannot be dealt with by one Government \r\nalone; they are by nature bilateral and multilateral concerns, and it is thus \r\nthat they should be treated. \r\nI come to financing, one of the most difficult issues related to \r\nAgenda 21. We have agreed on elaborate and apparently feasible programmes and \r\nprojects calculated to pursue the goal of sustainable development during the \r\nlast decade of the twentieth century and well into the twenty-first. \r\nBut translating blueprints into a desirable edifice requires the \r\nwherewithal. Hone of the programmes and projects described in Agenda 21 will \r\ncome to fruition without adequate funding. It must be noted that for these \r\nprogrammes the developing countries are expected to draw from their own \r\nresources to the extent of 80 per cent of costs. Only a meagre 20 per cent is \r\nexpected from international community contributions. \r\nIt is therefore critical that the Global Environment Facility be funded \r\nwith new, additional and adequate resources, that its scope be broadened and \r\nthat its governance be made more representative. But the Global Environment \r\nFacility is not enough. For developing countries to help themselves \r\ninitially, it is critical that they be relieved of the debt burden that weighs \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n24-25 \r\n(Mr. Padilla, Philippine^) \r\nheavily upon their economies; that higher levels of official development \r\nassistance (ODA) be granted them; and that there be significant help from \r\nInternational Development Association funds for those whose low incomes \r\nseriously impede their growth. \r\nAs we read in Agenda 21, \r\n\"Funding for Agenda 21 and other outcomes of the Conference should \r\nbe provided in a way that maximizes the availability of new and \r\nadditional resources and uses all available funding sources and \r\nmechanisms.\" (A/CONF.151/26. (Vol. Ill), para. 33.14). \r\nMy next subject is transfer of technology. Environmentally sound \r\ntechnologies and technologies for sustainable development continue to be \r\ndeveloped. One cannot expect impoverished developing countries to adopt such \r\ntechnologies, which cost money, unless they are shared as grants or unless \r\nthey are purchased, either at big discounts or with funds borrowed on \r\nconcessional and preferential terms. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n26 \r\n(Mr. Padilla. Philippines) \r\nOn the subject of institutional arrangements, if Agenda 21 is to be \r\nimplemented properly and efficiently it is important that a competent \r\norganization take the initiative in following up the provisions of the Agenda, \r\nevaluate the extent of its implementation, and make recoimnendatlons to \r\nspecific agencies and Governments whenever necessary and relevant. \r\nInitially, the Philippines held that a revitalized Economic and Social \r\nCouncil could take care of coordinating the implementation of UNCED\u0027s \r\ndecisions. He felt that the Council itself could create - should it consider \r\nthis necessary a committee from its own membership to deal with the concrete \r\nimplementation of General Assembly and Corincil decisions. He believed that \r\nthere was no need for a proliferation of bodies. However, eventually we joined \r\nthe consensus on the establishment of a Commission on Sustainable Development. \r\nHe hope that this Commission will operate in the broader context and in \r\nthe spirit of a progressive process of restructuring and revitalising the \r\nUnited Nations system, of which the Secretary-General spoke In his keynote \r\naddress at this debate. \r\nA paper on the nature and functions of this Coimilsslon has been prepared \r\nby the Group of 77 to clarify its position on the relevant consensus \r\nprovisions of jlgenda 21. We agree with the Group\u0027s position and we do not \r\nfeel any need to expound on its details further at this moment. \r\nAs we speak of procedures and modalities of follow-up and follow-through, \r\nit is important to remember at all times the ultimate goal not only of UNCED \r\nbut also of all our efforts in the United Nations: the perfection of man\u0027s \r\nlife now and in the future. \r\nMr. MARTINI HERRERA (Guatemala)(interpretation from Spanish)i On \r\nbehalf of the delegations of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n27 \r\n(Mr. Martini Herrera, Guatemala) \r\nNicaragua and Panama, I have the honour to speak on the agenda item \"Report of \r\nthe United Hations Conference on Environment and Development\". He are \r\ngrateful for the timely and satisfactory introduction of the report. We the \r\ncountries of Central America attach special importance to this subject. Our \r\nPresidents and high-level representatives were present at this event of \r\nworld-wide significance. \r\nCentral American participation in the last preparatory meeting before \r\nUNCED was very active. It was a catalytic event for our countries, and our \r\nPresidents and representatives to be able to participate actively and support \r\nthe contents of Agenda 21 as negotiated, and thus share in the agreements on \r\nthe protection of the environment which UNCED produced. \r\nToday we Central Americans continue to be concerned by the way in which \r\nthe subject of the environment might be dealt with. He are following up the \r\nestablishment of a commission on the environment which came out of the Rio de \r\nJaneiro Conference and which is to ensure compliance with the agreements \r\nreached at the Conference. The commission must be set up in accordance with \r\ngenuinely equitable geographical distribution, in which subregions like \r\nCentral America are adequately represented. By that I mean that the direct \r\nparticipation of our region must be ensured. Of necessity the commission must \r\nreflect the concerns of all countries, both developed and developing, but \r\nespecially those of the developing countries because of their need to struggle \r\nagainst misery, poverty and ignorance. It must comply effectively with the \r\nright to development, which those of us living in countries which have not yet \r\nattained it, in particular the small countries, must be able to achieve as a \r\nmatter of urgency. \r\nThe commission must hi ve available to it the necessary assistance and \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n28-30 \r\n(Mr. Martini Herrera. Guatemala) \r\ninfrastructure so that it can comply effectively with the functions agreed to \r\nin chapter 38 of Agenda 21, and to be able to make the necessary inputs, \r\nreports and studies of high quality and content, which can serve our countries \r\nin adopting adequate development decisions and policies in accordance with the \r\nRio de Janeiro agreements. \r\nThe important tasks of the commission suggest three areas of activity \r\nwhich have to be carefully outlined; it should be a follow-up agent to the \r\nactions of the United Nations and the other international organizations in \r\nimplementing Agenda 21 and promoting sustained development; a mechanism for \r\nreviewing the flow of financial resources to the developing countries in \r\nsupport of their efforts to attain sustainable development; and a forum with \r\nhigh-level participation for discussing, forming a consensus on and taking \r\ndecisions regarding the subjects contained in Agenda 21. Its activity must be \r\ndirected towards assistance, transfer of technology and exchange of \r\ninformation; it should not be an organ of judgement and condemnation. \r\nEmphasis must be placed on international cooperation; we must bear in mind \r\nthat every country has its own origin and history but that we all have a \r\ncommon future. \r\nWe cannot fail to emphasize our concern at the limited results of the \r\nconference in respect of the financial resources which are so essential if we \r\nare to be able to clean up the environment. It is our feeling that there is \r\nno reciprocal commitment between those whose economies are stronger and who \r\ncould make a bigger contribution to solving environmental problems and all the \r\nrest of us who are so short of the resources and technology required to do \r\nso. It follows from the results of UNCED that most of the financial resources \r\nto be allocated to environmental matters will have to come disproportionately \r\nfrom the South, from the developing sector. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n31 \r\n(Mr. Martini Herrera. \r\nGuatemala) \r\nThe environment is too important to the survival of our planet, and a \r\ngreater political will on the part of all States Members of the United Nations \r\nis essential for us to be able to fulfil the goals and objectives envisaged \r\nand adopted in Rio. Its importance was emphasized by the impressive \r\nparticipation by the Heads of State or Government of most countries of the \r\nworld. This clearly reflects existing concern at the deterioration of the \r\nenvironment, environmental pollution, the use and abuse of natural resources \r\nby the most industrialized countries, as well as the desire to establish a \r\ngenuine international cooperation that would allow the developing countries to \r\ngive impetus to acceptable and ecologically sustainable development without \r\ncondemning their peoples to backwardness and primitivism. \r\nIt is imperative to point out that 80 per cent of the world\u0027s population \r\nlives in the developing countries. Most live below the extreme-poverty line, \r\nwith privations of every kind and lack of access to health services, drinking \r\nwater, education and fuel. In the rural areas, human beings simply subsist; \r\nthey enjoy neither the conveniences nor the facilities of the urban areas, and \r\nfar fewer of the common medicines that the peoples of the developed countries \r\ntake for granted. \r\nIt is for these sectors of the population that it is essential to \r\nformulate strategies and policies to assure their economic growth and social \r\ndevelopment, in conditions of equality, dignity, security, well-being and \r\nindependence, with respect for their cultural heritage and their lifestyles. \r\nHe cannot accept as a final result of the Conference unilateral and compulsory \r\nmeasures imposed by those whose development since the industrial revolution \r\nhas in large measure, been at the expense of the world environment. If there \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n32 \r\n(Mr. Martini Herrera, \r\nGuatemala) \r\nis to be genuine international cooperation, how can the Rio commitment be \r\nimposed on the developing countries unless the developed countries show the \r\nwill to implement the same rules, support the process of integral development \r\nand facilitate cooperation by allocating resources and adopting measures that \r\nwill improve the international economic environment? \r\nHe, the Central American countries, are aware of the need to protect the \r\nenvironment, and we have the political will to do so, as was proved by the \r\nfact that tJie Presidents of the region at their summit meetings have entered \r\ninto commitments to protect it. Every country of the subregion has set up a \r\nnational commission that cooperates and coordinates closely with the Central \r\nAmerican Commission on the Environment, national and subregional strategies \r\ncontain important segments for that purpose. The Special Plan of Economic \r\nCooperation for Central America also includes efforts to promote and improve \r\nthe environment, and support is given to Governments to design a strategy to \r\nbe followed at the world conference. \r\nConcerted efforts by the countries of Central America have yielded \r\npositive results, such as the establishment of a Central American system of \r\nprotected areas; the signing of a regional Convention that forbids any \r\ncross-border movement of-toxic wastes; and the Central American Convention on \r\nbiodiversity, which was signed recently in Managua, Nicaragua. It is \r\nimportant to emphasize the actions agreed to in relation to indigenous peoples \r\nand their development, and the national and regional plan submitted by the \r\nfirst Ladies of Central AiiK\u0027rica entitled \"Homen, Environment and \r\nDevelopment\". These programmes will also require the necessary financing to \r\nbecome reality. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n33 \r\n(Mr. Martini Herrera. \r\nGuatemala) \r\nCentral America participated actively in the meeting held in Mexico that \r\nled to the Tlatelolco Treaty, which contains the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nstrategy on the subject. Programmes of exchange of debt in kind have been \r\ntried, and their benefits or limitations should be assessed in order to \r\ndetermine their desirability. In cooperation with the United Hations \r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UHESCO), we have developed \r\nan aggressive programme designed to protect the environment, the Maya Route, \r\nwhich promotes tourism with an ecological conscience. All of these will \r\nrequire sufficient and varied resources to enable us to advance significantly \r\nin this vital field. \r\nHe Central Americans belong to one of the few remaining regions of the \r\nplanet with a tropical rain forest, home to a wealth of biological variety \r\nwhose potential has yet to be fully studied. We listened with great interest \r\nto the proposal made by Canada to finance three model forests in developing \r\ncountries, and we feel that our region offers ideal conditions for that \r\nproject to be viable and beneficial for our planet. He urge this sister \r\ncountry, in coordination with our Governments, to give serious study to the \r\npossibility of financing the establishment of one of these model forests in \r\nCentral America. \r\nUHESCO has declared as a patrimony of humankind several zones and places \r\ncontaining cultural and indigenous cities and centres, as well as the \r\nbiosphere reserve of the Platano River in Honduras, considered the largest in \r\nLatin America after the Amazon. We must accordingly conclude that its jungle \r\nrenders a service to the survival of our planet, as does the Amazon region in \r\nthe southern hemisphere of the American continent. And yet this service goes \r\nA/47/PV. 56 \r\n34 \r\n(Mr. Martini Herrera, \r\nGuatemala) \r\nunnoticed in the world. While international, commercial and multilateral \r\nbanking is concerned with debt payment, including interest, no recognition is \r\ngiven of the debt that the developed countries owe to all those less developed \r\ncountries, which, by their very nature, generate the oxygen needed for human \r\nsurvival and serve to lessen the noxious effects of carbon monoxide. This \r\nservice should be recognized in a just and equitable manner, as required by \r\ncircumstances. \r\nIn order to be able to protect the environment adequately, we need \r\nconcerted action and international solidarity. In this context, we support \r\nthe statement made by the Chairman of the Group of 77, as expressed by his \r\nMinisters at the last ministerial meeting, to the effect that the environment \r\nis a concern of humankind and that its problems must be solved through \r\nmultilateral cooperation based on common but differentiated responsibility and \r\nwith a balanced perspective. \r\nIt is accordingly necessary to negotiate and define the parameters, \r\nstrategies and policies that will give life to the concept of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\nWe also need the commitment of both the wealthy and less wealthy nations \r\nto cooperate more fully and struggle to narrow and eventually close tihe \r\never-widening gap between the two. It is unacceptable that 20 per cent of the \r\nworld\u0027s population should have a profusion of goods and services available to \r\nthem while the rest of the world subsists in a harsh environment, without \r\nsufficient access to education, health care, housing, drinking water and basic \r\nservices. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n35 \r\n(Mr. Martini Herrera. \r\nGuatemala) \r\nWe should not seek to change indigenous cultures; rather we should give \r\nthem access to education which will lead to an awareness of the need to \r\nprotect the environment - and to life with dignity. It is essential to \r\npromote the education of women and children, and for women to participate in \r\nthe decision-making processes affecting the integral development of their \r\nsocieties, because it is women who bear primary responsibility for the care, \r\nnurturing and quality of family life. \r\nHow are we to persuade our rural populations that they are not to \r\ncontinue to cut down trees or burn fields for purposes of agricultural \r\nproduction or the feeding of livestock, unless we can provide them an adequate \r\nincome that will guarantee not only their survival but a better life? \r\nAny strategy that ignores that reality is doomed to failure. \r\nA/47/PV. 56 \r\n36 \r\n(Mr. Martini Herrera, \r\nGuatemala) \r\nThe item on Agenda 21 is of paramount importance, as the strategy for the \r\nnext century must be broad and include, inter alia, development guidelines, \r\nmechanisms and priorities, the modalities and allocation of responsibilities, \r\nincluding financial responsibilities, and the urgent need for the transfer of \r\nenvironmentally sound technology. Yet, we are concerned that this technology \r\nand cooperation for development will be insufficient and/or limited, or that \r\nthe anticipated costs of acquiring such technology will make it inaccessible, \r\nwhich would make international efforts ineffective. Our countries, in \r\nextremely difficult circumstances that are well known, have contracted an \r\nexternal debt that we must renegotiate in the light of the realities that gave \r\nrise to them, and we cannot therefore incur more debt in the same way. \r\nThe United Hations should consider mechanisms to strengthen \r\ncapacity-building in the developing countries by effective technical \r\ncooperation programmes and transfer of know-how and technology. The \r\npossibility should be considered of holding workshops and arranging exchanges \r\nof information among the various regions of the world so as to share \r\nexperience and avoid the errors committed in the past in order to improve the \r\nnational capability to protect the environment and its ecosystem. For it is \r\nthe indigenous peoples who must be educated and trained to be able to make a \r\nrational and responsible use of their natural resources and, from the trade \r\nand exploitation of these resources, to receive an income that will enable \r\nthem to exercise their fundamental rights recognized in international \r\ninstruments. \r\nOur countries must not be condemned to poverty, ignorance and \r\nbackwardness. What is required therefore is the commitment of the developed \r\nA/47/PV. 56 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Martini Herrera. \r\nGuatemala) \r\ncountries to permit free access to their markets, eliminate protectionist \r\nmeasures and respect fair prices for the products of the developing \r\ncountries. The developing countries are not asking for alms; they are asking \r\nfor what is genuinely theirs by law. \r\nWe must also emphasize the importance of promoting and encouraging close \r\ncooperation between the developing countries, as we must face our internal \r\nproblems and find our own solutions. He, the developing countries, must \r\nassume our historic responsibility over our future, which implies economic, \r\nsocial and political stability leading to general well-being in conjunction \r\nwith environmental awareness and responsibility. He must forge our destiny \r\nand carry it out, and invest our resources rationally and productively for the \r\nbenefit of our peoples. \r\nHe, the developing countries, have serious problems and very critical \r\naspects that we have to solve. In Central America our political independence \r\nwas threatened in recent years and some countries embarked on fratricidal wars \r\nthat led to an ever-increasing degree of poverty. Owing to structural \r\nadjustment programmes, social sacrifices have been enormous. Our budgets were \r\neven reduced for education, health, social services and environmental clean-up, \r\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean today we are being threatened by the \r\nresurgence of cholera. The whole world is being attacked by a series of \r\nepidemics and other conditions and diseases in addition to the usually \r\ncritical health problems. Our economic .indexes have been lowered to levels \r\nbelow those of 20 years ago and yet today we are facing a challenge - our \r\nintegrated development in a better and more just world, in which the riches of \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n38 \r\n(Mr. Martini Herrera, \r\nGuatemala) \r\nnature are being defended and preserved, but without sacrificing human beings, \r\nwhich are the most wonderful miracle of Creation. The international community \r\nfaces a challenge in future - to create a lifestyle in harmony with nature, \r\nwhich should be our commitment for the twenty-first century. \r\nMr. PEHHAHEACH (Togo) (interpretation from French): \"The Earth is \r\nunique! Let us take care of it together!\" \r\nThis inspiring slogan is both an acknowledgement of the dangers \r\nthreatening our good old Earth, the common heritage of mankind, and an urgent \r\nappeal to joint action to save it and better distribute its many riches. \r\nThe irrepressible euphoria long caused by the numerous benefits of \r\nscientific and technical progress for social, cultural, political and economic \r\nlife is receding increasingly today against the repeated and destructive \r\nassaults on the environment by man\u0027s economic and industrial activities and by \r\npatterns of consumption and social organization. \r\nThe objective limits of scientism, or better, an apology for the conquest \r\nand transformation of nature are increasingly noticeable today to such an \r\nextent that, to paraphrase the famous French writer, Rabelais, we are tempted \r\nto state that science without conscience only brings ruin to the environment \r\nand to development. \r\nQuite revealing in this regard is the report of the United Hations \r\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP) on the state of the environment from 1972 to \r\n1992. This report quite rightly emphasizes the various forms of environmental \r\ndeterioration and their impact on development. Indeed, research carried out \r\nover the past two decades indicates that the usual atmospheric pollutants have \r\nbeen compounded by numerous organic components and trace metals that have been \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n39-40 \r\n(Mr. Pennaneach. Togo) \r\nreleased into the atmosphere by hxunan activity. The pollution of the \r\natmosphere has had effects on human health, on vegetation and on various \r\nmaterials. \r\nAs to the depletion of the ozone layer, which is a world problem \r\nrequiring worldwide solutions, the report of UNEP reveals that this phenomenon \r\nmight have undesirable consequences for the Earth\u0027s climate and, among other \r\nthings, might result in an increase in ultraviolet rays reaching the Earth\u0027s \r\nsurface. Exposure to these rays might lead to a weakening of the immtine \r\nsystem and could increase the incidence or seriousness of some illnesses. \r\nWe should also note that the world increase in concentrations of hothouse \r\ngases in the atmosphere and the resulting climate changes could have serious \r\nrepercussions on natural ecosystems. \r\nMoreover, the UHEP report emphasizes that some human activities have a \r\ndirect impact on coastal areas, and that the over-exploitation of marine \r\nbiological resources entails, among other things, the danger of sharply \r\nreducing fish supplies. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n41 \r\n(Mr. Pennaneach. Togo) \r\nWe want to place special emphasis on the report\u0027s important conclusion \r\nthat soil degradation and desertification are preventing countries from \r\nproducing sufficient food to meet the needs of their peoples and thus reducing \r\nregional and world food-production capacities. \r\nComing after the Stockholm Conference, which blazed the trail towards \r\nbetter joint management of the environment, the Rio Conference on Environment \r\nand Development has already gone down in history as a new acknowledgement of \r\nour common destiny and as a crucial stage in the quest for ways and means to \r\npromote development with a truly human dimension. \r\nWhile the Conference did not respond fully to the legitimate concerns and \r\nexpectations of the developing countries, it is none the less true that it \r\nsucceeded in reaching very useful conclusions; first, recognition of \r\ncollective responsibility for the deterioration of the environment, of the \r\nvital need to take urgent measures to improve environmental protection and of \r\nthe dynamic interaction between environment and development; and, secondly, \r\nestablishment of a solid foundation for sustainable development, through the \r\nadoption of important decisions, including the Conventions on climate change \r\nand biological diversity, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development -\r\na true environmental charter - and, above all. Agenda 21, a relatively \r\nconsistent and ambitious programme of action. \r\nThe results of the Rio Conference were even more meaningful because they \r\nwere based on a new approach to development; a more integrated and \r\nmultidimensional approach. \r\nAs the Secretary-General stresses in his report on the work of the \r\nOrganization, \r\n\"[The Rio Conference] opened new paths for communication and cooperation \r\nbetween official and non-official organizations working towards \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Pennaneach. Toqtf) \r\ndevelopmental and environmental goals [and] led to an enormous increase \r\nin public awareness of the issues that were tackled in the process an \r\nawareness that ought to facilitate the adoption of policies and the \r\nallocation of additional resources to fulfil the task\". (A/47/1. \r\npara. 76) \r\nIt will no longer be possible to consider any viable development programme \r\nwithout incorporating the crucial environmental dimension. \r\nIf Rio is not to remain just another manifestation of international \r\nsolidarity, generous intentions and fine promises, it is absolutely essential \r\nthat we concentrate on the speedy implementation and efficient functioning of \r\nthe machinery for follow-up and evaluation, and on mobilizing the necessary \r\nfinancial resources. Like the Secretary-General, we urge the donor community \r\nto release the necessary resources in order to serve the common interests of \r\nthe entire world. In that connection, we urge that a pledging conference for \r\nfinancing Agenda 21 be convened as soon as possible. \r\nFurthermore, the delegation of Togo considers that urgent decisions must \r\nbe taken at this session of the General Assembly, in particular with respect \r\nto an international intergovernmental negotiating committee to draft an \r\ninternational convention on desertification, and with respect to the \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development, to an international conference on \r\nsustainable development for small island developing States and to a world \r\nconference on sharing experience in the integrated management and sustainable \r\ndevelopment of marine and coastal zones. \r\nThe dimensions and gravity of drought and desertification are clearly \r\nstated in the report of the Secretary-General on the campaign against those \r\nscourges. The report says that 84 per cent of the 5.2 billion hectares of \r\narid land that are potentially productive are exposed to drought and \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n43 \r\n(Mr. Pennaneach. Togo) \r\ndesertification. It is estimated that some 3.6 billion hectares, or \r\n70 per cent of the total, are currently threatened by various forms of \r\ndeterioration of the land, especially desertification, which will adversely \r\naffect the well-being and future of those who live there. \r\nIn that context, it goes without saying that it is a matter of great \r\nurgency to draft an international convention on desertification. In the view \r\nof my delegation, and as many other African delegations have already stressed \r\nin this Hall, the negotiating process for that convention should meet the \r\nfollowing requirements: \r\nFirst, it must take due account of the close relationship between \r\ndesertification and drought. \r\nSecondly, in view of the relatively short time-frame for completing the \r\nconvention 18 months from January 1993 - it would be desirable for \r\npreparations to be carried out with great care and discipline. The members of \r\nthe negotiating committee should be persons of great competence. During the \r\npreparatory work, the committee should have the benefit of contributions from \r\nand the expertise of United Hations agencies competent in the sphere of \r\ndesertification and drought, particularly the United Nations Environment \r\nProgramme, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Hations, the \r\nUnited Hations Sudano-Sahelian Office and the Horld Meteorological \r\nOrganization. \r\nThirdly, countries directly affected and concerned by desertification and \r\ndrought, as well as the least developed countries, should have access to \r\nfinancial and technical facilities to enable them to take an active part in \r\nthe entire negotiating process. In that connection, a fund should be created \r\nwithout delay, and substantial contributions should be made to it. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n44-45 \r\n(Mr. Pennaneach. Togo) \r\nFourthly, attention should be given to strengthening the warning and \r\nmonitoring system for desertification and drought. \r\nFifthly, in preparing his progress report on the negotiations, the \r\nchairman of the intergovernmental committee should indicate whether the work \r\nhad advanced to the point where the convention could be completed in time or \r\nwhether an extension was necessary. The idea is to ensure a sound convention. \r\nFinally, the drafting should take into due account the concerns and \r\nproblems of the countries affected by desertification and drought; at the same \r\ntime, it should proceed in a spirit of constructive dialogue and consensus, so \r\nas to facilitate the subsequent ratification of the convention and its rapid \r\nentry into force. \r\nBy the terms of chapter 38 of Agenda 21, a high-level Commission on \r\nSustainable Development should be established in accordance with Article 68 of \r\nthe Charter of the United Hations in order to ensure the effective follow-up \r\nof the Conference, as well as to enhance international cooperation and \r\nrationalize the intergoveriunental decision-making capacity for the integration \r\nof environment and development issues and to examine the progress in the \r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 at the national, regional and international \r\nlevels. It is clear from that chapter that the Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment has a central role to play in the follow-up of the Rio \r\nConference. In that connection, my delegation believes that in its \r\nfunctioning it should meet the following requirements! \r\nFirst, the Commission secretariat should be sufficiently competent to \r\nprovide the best assistance to the Commission in the fulfilment of its \r\nmandate. It should be a separate entity led by an Under-Secretary-General \r\nreporting to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n46 \r\n(Mr. Pennaneach. Togo) \r\nSecondly, special attention should be given to ways and means of \r\nfacilitating the transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing \r\ncountries and the mobilization of financial resources and information from, \r\nand effective participation by, non-governmental organizations. In this \r\nconnection, chapters 33, 34 and 38 of Agenda 21 should be put into effect. \r\nThirdly, the Commission on Sustainable Development should also follow \r\nclosely the implementation of programmes to eliminate poverty and hunger, \r\nwhich bring about destruction of the environment. \r\nFourthly, like many African delegations such as those of Burkina Faso, \r\nBenin, Gabon and others, we should like the first session of the Commission to \r\nbe held in 1993 in New York. \r\nFifthly, the Togolese delegation supports the proposals of the \r\nGroup of 77, especially the proposal that the Commission should have 53 \r\nmembers. \r\nIn any case, the Commission on Sustainable Development should act as a \r\nwatchdog, at the appropriate time identifying obstacles to the implementation \r\nof Agenda 21 and formulating recommendations in that regard. \r\nIn the exchange of experience on integrated management and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in marine and coastal zones, we must not lose sight of the \r\ndifficult problem of coastal erosion, to which many coastal developing \r\ncountries fall victim. \r\nIn my delegation\u0027s view, there must be a world conference on this \r\nimportant problem by the end of 1993, in accordance with the recommendations \r\nin chapter 17 of Agenda 21. \r\nSustainable development also reguires that environmentally sound \r\nmanagement of toxic chemical substances and dangerous waste materials and \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Pennaneach. Togo) \r\nradioactive waste prevent, among other things, traffic in such materials to \r\ndeveloping countries. This is especially timely because most countries are \r\nnot equipped to process such products. \r\nThe strengthening of the role of major groups is also provided for in \r\nAgenda 21 as another effective means of fostering sustainable development. \r\nHomen, non-governmental organizations and farmers are the target groups that \r\nshould be given substantial assistance to enable them to make their full \r\ncontribution to development. \r\nHith this in view, we must ensure swift implementation of the following \r\nmeasures. \r\nFirst, an evaluation by the Secretary-General of the role of all the \r\nbodies of the United Hations system, especially those that emphasize the \r\ncontribution of women to the attainment of objectives set for development and \r\nenvironment, and the formulation of recommendations to strengthen their \r\ncapacities. \r\nSecondly, the elaboration of programmes designed to eliminate negative \r\nimages, stereotypes, persistent conduct and prejudice against women and to \r\nbring about a heightened awareness of the importance of women as consumers and \r\npromote their active participation in decision-making. \r\nThirdly, a study by the United Hations system of ways to strengthen \r\nexisting proceedings and mechanisms to enable non-governmental organizations \r\nto participate in policy planning, decision-making and the implementation and \r\nevaluation of the activities of each body. \r\nFourthly, a study of levels of financing and administrative support for \r\nnon-governmental organizations, as well as the degree of their participation \r\nin the implementation and effectiveness of plans and programmes, with a view \r\nto increasing the role of these organizations as social partners. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n48 \r\n(Mr. Pennaneach. Togo) \r\nFifthly, the development of environmentally sound agricultural techniques \r\nin order to increase yields while maintaining soil quality, recycling \r\nnutritive elements, saving water and energy and combating parasites and \r\nnoxious weeds, as well as studies on types of agriculture that require many \r\nresources and those that require few, in order to compare their productivity \r\nand durability. \r\nThe implementation of the ambitious Agenda 21 goes far beyond the major \r\nchallenges we shall face in the twenty-first century, in the hope of creating \r\na world in which all can live well. \r\nGaining an increased awareness that we all belong to the same planet and \r\nthat we must make joint efforts to prevent it from deteriorating amounts to \r\nestablishing the milestones for a new vision of interdependence and \r\ninternational cooperation for development. \r\nHe must today act to save mankind and its habitat. As Georges Duhamel \r\nsaid, \"Hith due deference to zealots who favour new technology and those who \r\nprofit from inventions, however admirable, our role - that of the United \r\nHations - is carefully to consider changes in habits and to counter the \r\nshortcomings of a civilization that is now devouring itself\". In order to do \r\nthat, we must act, and act quickly. \r\nIn the interest of all mankind, let us see to it that this exceptional \r\nupsurge of solidarity is accompanied by concrete action that can give \r\nsustainable development a fourfold dimension: equitable distribution of the \r\nworld\u0027s wealth; reduction of the gap between rich and poor countries; final \r\nelimination of poverty and hunger; and consolidation of the balance between \r\nmankind and its environment. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n49-50 \r\n(Mr. Pennaneach. Togo) \r\nMr. BUTLER (Australia): Australia welcomes the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\nreport on the United Hations Conference on Environment and Development \r\n(UNCED). \r\nThe Earth Summit was the culmination of two years of extremely complex \r\nand sometimes contentious negotiations. Those negotiations were supported \r\neffectively by the UNCED secretariat and the secretariats of the climate \r\nchange and biodiversity intergovernmental negotiating committees. \r\nAustralia congratulates the Secretary-General of the Conference for his \r\nable and enthusiastic management of the largest international meeting ever. \r\nHe reiterate our appreciation to the host country, Brazil, for the \r\nexcellent facilities provided to the Summit. \r\nUHCED was of historic importance for two central reasons; it responded \r\nto the urgent need to move to a sustainable path for global development, and \r\nit gave birth to an unprecedented spirit of cooperation and consensus. Our \r\ntask now is to maintain that historic momentum. \r\nThe Australian environment is characterized by a varied range of \r\nsensitive ecosystems, rich in biodiversity, with a large number of species \r\nfound only in Australia. At the same time we rely economically on resource-\r\nbased industries. \r\nAccordingly the Earth Summit and its outcomes are important for \r\nAustralia. The Brundtland report, the UHCED preparations and the Rio \r\nConference itself encourage the Australian community not just environment \r\norganizations, but industry, indigenous groups, development organizations and \r\nothers to consider in depth, and to participate actively in discussions on, \r\nand approaches to, sustainable development. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. Butler. Australia) \r\nIn 1989 the Australian Government established a number of national \r\nworking groups to make recommendations for sustainable development, in \r\nparticular economic sectors, and to deal with cross-sectoral issues. These \r\nworking groups draw on the expertise of environmentalists, industrialists, \r\nscientists and other academics, and other community interest groups. He have \r\nmade substantial progress in the introduction of appropriate policies designed \r\nto achieve sustainable development. The UHCED outcomes will provide \r\nadditional guidance to our future efforts. \r\nUHCED fulfilled the challenging mandate set by resolution 44/228. It \r\naddressed the multitude of interlinked issues that are the conditions for \r\nsustainable development the use of resources, the avoidance of pollution, \r\npoverty alleviation and international trade, and the building of financial, \r\ntechnological and human capacities. \r\nThe United Hations Framework Convention on Climate Change is an excellent \r\nstarting point for further international efforts to tackle a subject which is \r\nextremely complex in both economic and scientific terms. The urgency of \r\nprecautionary action on climate change cannot be underestimated, as our \r\ncolleagues from low-lying island States and coastal areas know very well. \r\nAustralia has moved quickly to institute consultations on measures we \r\nneed to take in order to ratify the Convention. He are confident that many of \r\nthese measures are already in place. He encourage other countries to ratify \r\nthe Convention so that it can enter into force as soon as possible. In the \r\nmeantime, Australia is keen to participate in the ongoing meetings of the \r\nIntergovernmental negotiating Committee to prepare a programme of work for the \r\nConference of Parties. \r\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity is the most significant \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. Butler. Australia) \r\ndevelopment in decades in the field of conservation and the sustainable use of \r\nliving resources. It contains agreements on conserving the Earth\u0027s species, \r\necosystems and genetic diversity, and also promotes cooperation on the \r\nsustainable utilization of genetic resources. Hork is now underway in \r\nAustralia towards the ratification of the Convention, and we look forward to \r\nits early entry into force. Australia is also developing a national strategy \r\nfor the protection of biodiversity. \r\nThe high number of signatories to these Conventions is evidence of the \r\ninternational community\u0027s commitment to action on the vital issues they \r\naddress. This should facilitate their early entry into force. \r\nThe varying priorities of the delegations to the UHCED Preparatory \r\nCommittee for the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development are reflected \r\nin the cautious balance of the text. In our view, the text includes the \r\nessence of a number of important sustainable-development principles, and the \r\nDeclaration also represents the current consensus of the international \r\ncommunity on guiding principles for sustainable development. He must hope \r\nthat, by providing guidance for the implementation of Agenda 21, the Rio \r\nDeclaration will assist in building confidence and strengthening cooperation \r\nbetween developed and developing countries on sustainable development, and by \r\nthis means contribute to stronger, shared views in the future. \r\nThe statement of forest principles, like the Rio Declaration, reflects a \r\nfragile consensus. But it, too, contains some important principles. Action \r\non the forests chapter of Agenda 21 should facilitate the implementation of \r\nthe statement. \r\nAgenda 21 reflects a consensus of the international community concerning \r\nthe actions that need to be taken at all levels to achieve sustainable \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Butler. Australia) \r\ndevelopment in all sectors. In many cases, these actions are to be taken \r\nthrough other intergovernmental conferences and meetings tasked with \r\ndeveloping further agreed policies on sustainable development with respect to \r\nspecific issues. Agenda 21 is also described in its preamble as being open to \r\nrevision in the future. Thus, it carries the seeds of its own development and \r\nadaptation to changing needs. \r\nAgenda 21 is a comprehensive and valuable resource. In the United \r\nHations system. Agenda 21 should be regarded as a key development strategy \r\nwith which individual programmes must be made consistent. Many of the Agenda \r\n21 recommendations will reflect objectives already pursued in the individual \r\nprogrammes of various United Hations bodies. Australia hopes that not only \r\nthe international organizations and national Governments, but also local \r\nauthorities, industry and community organizations will become familiar with \r\nAgenda 21 and help promote its importance. \r\nAustralia intends to continue assisting developing countries to build \r\nhuman, institutional and technological capacities for implementation of the \r\nUNCED outcomes. The Australian overseas development assistance programme \r\nalready places a strong emphasis on poverty alleviation, training and \r\npopulation issues, which are important to sustainable development. Assistance \r\nin the development and implementation of sustainable land and marine resources \r\npolicies already have a strong place in Australia\u0027s overseas aid programme. \r\nWe have also built ecological sustainability requirements into all elements of \r\nour overseas aid programme. \r\nAustralia is committed to the provision of new and additional financial \r\nresources for developing countries through the Global Environment Facility \r\n(GEF), to address agreed environmental activities of global significance that \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n54-55 \r\n(Mr. Butler. Australia) \r\nprovide global benefits. Along with other GEF participants, we have supported \r\nthe need to review the governance of the GEF in line with proposals already \r\nunder way. \r\nAustralia made an early commitment to contribute additional funds for \r\nenvironmental activities. Last year, in the lead-up to UHCED, Australia \r\nannounced a new $80-million, four-year environment assistance programme to \r\npromote ecologically sustainable development through bilateral, regional and \r\nglobal cooperation programmes. He also announced a commitment to provide \r\n$30 million to the GEF over seven years. \r\nAt the 1992 South Pacific Forum, Prime Minister Keating announced that \r\npart of our contribution to the GEF would be used to support the GEF\u0027s South \r\nPacific biodiversity conservation programme. He also announced that our \r\nsupport for regional climate monitoring activities would be increased. In \r\n1991, Australia established an International Tropical Marine Resource Centre \r\nto provide training in tropical marine resource management. \r\nWhat should the General Assembly do to facilitate early follow-up to \r\nUHCED? Australia hopes that the General Assembly will strongly endorse the \r\nUHCED outcomes. They are the result of lengthy and complex negotiations, the \r\nsubstance of which should not be revisited or reopened here. \r\nBut it is also necessary to lay the groundwork for carrying forward \r\nspecific UHCED initiatives. For example, a major task of the General Assembly \r\nat this session will be to create the new Commission for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. The Commission will play a crucial role in the integration of \r\nenvironment and development activities throughout the United Nations system. \r\nIt will have responsibility for the implementation of Agenda 21 at the \r\ninternational, national and regional levels, and for the review of the \r\nfinancing of Agenda 21. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n56 \r\n(Mr. Butler. Australia) \r\nWe believe the Commission should include a high-level segment which would \r\nconstitute both a venue for political decision-making and a forum for debate \r\non and discussion of progress towards the implementation, development and \r\nupdating of Agenda 21. \r\nAustralia attaches considerable importance to the open and effective \r\nparticipation of relevant non-governmental organizations in the Coinmission. \r\nRules of procedure must be established for the Commission based on those \r\napplying to the UNCED process to ensure such participation. \r\nThe activities of all United Nations and non-United Nations multilateral \r\norganizations in the environment and development fields, including the \r\ninternational, financial and trade institutions, are relevant to the \r\nCommission\u0027s mandate. The participation of specially appointed \r\nrepresentatives from those agencies in the work of the Commission will be \r\nvital to its success. \r\nAustralia attaches great importance to government plans for sustainable \r\ndevelopment, and would strongly encourage the submission of reports by \r\nnational Governments on such plans and on any difficulties they encounter in \r\nimplementing them. Countries should report on all aspects of Agenda 21, \r\nincluding, in the case of developed countries, their initiatives to assist \r\ndeveloping countries. Such exchanges of information will prove vital in the \r\nproper evaluation of the contents and implementation of Agenda 21,and will \r\nbenefit all participants. \r\nAustralia supports the establishment of an intergovernmental conference \r\non straddling stocks and highly migratory species. There are real and \r\npressing problems of stock depletion which may be resolved only if more \r\neffective cooperation mechanisms can be developed in relation to those \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Butler, Australia) \r\nstocks. We believe that members of the international community should work to \r\nconvene the conference as soon as possible. Some fundamental questions on the \r\nimplementation of rights and obligations under the Law of the Sea Convention \r\nand the strengthening of conservation and proper management of fisheries need \r\nto be addressed urgently. The work of the conference is of particular \r\nimportance to developing coastal States, and we urge that some mechanism be \r\nfound to assist their participation in the conference and in the preparatory \r\ncommittees leading up to it. \r\nThe General Assembly should establish an intergovernmental negotiating \r\ncommittee for the elaboration of a convention on desertification. Australia \r\nhopes that the committee will address the underlying causes of \r\ndesertification, but it would not be desirable for the General Assembly to \r\nattempt to anticipate the substantive provisions of such a convention before \r\nthe committee began its work. We consider the main United Nations agencies \r\nhaving a central role in supporting the negotiations to be the United Nations \r\nEnvironment Programme (UHEP), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \r\nUnited Hations (FAO) and the United Hations Development Programme (UHDP). \r\nWe also support the convening of a conference on sustainable development \r\nfor small island States. Such a conference should provide a valuable \r\nopportunity for small islands of different regions to share their experience \r\nand consolidate information networks on the development of sustainable \r\ndevelopment plans relevant to the particular difficulties they face. He look \r\nforward to working with the countries of the Alliance of Small Island States \r\nto consider the modalities for that conference. \r\nThe Rio Conference was a turning point of historic importance; that is \r\nclear. But precisely because it had that character it represented not the \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr. Butler. Australia) \r\nend, but the beginning, of a long and complex process. The concept of \r\nsustainable development has introduced a new dimension to the traditional \r\nHorth-South focus of United Nations economic activity. Our future approaches \r\nto these issues must be different and linked by our vital, mutual interest in \r\nthe preservation of an environment and the achievement of development which \r\ncan be sustained for future generations. The Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment has a central role to play in this process. \r\nEarlier this year we took a major step in the right direction, a \r\ndirection we all need to follow and must follow. Our task is to build on that \r\nnow, for the future. \r\nMr. CAMILLERI (Malta): There is general agreement that this year\u0027s \r\nUnited Hations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de \r\nJaneiro reached out to the global community at large more forcefully and \r\neffectively than any previous United Nations conference has ever done. This \r\nis due to many factors, both substantive and organizational. They include the \r\nunprecedented number, range and level of participants; the immense scope of \r\nthe issues tackled, together with the impressive manner in which their \r\ncomplexity and interrelatedness were conceptualized, the direct relevance of \r\nthe core subjects to individuals throughout the world; and the major \r\norganizational effort of those involved - in particular, the Government and \r\npeople of Brazil. \r\nHhat is rightly regarded as the outstanding success of Rio is therefore \r\nthe product of relevance, commitment and imagination. These qualities must \r\ncontinue to be available in abundance if Rio is, in the long run, to be seen \r\nas the watershed of a long and complex collective endeavour rather than as an \r\nisolated expression of a concerned but ultimately passive humanity. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n59 \r\n(Mr. Camilleri, Malta) \r\nAt the beginning of the follow-up process to Rio it is perhaps useful to \r\nmention briefly those things which the Conference did not do, since through \r\ntheir absence these elements contributed to the successful outcome. Rio \r\navoided two tempting extremes, one arising from cataclysmic scenarios of an \r\nirrevocably deteriorating natural environment and the other from the \r\nconfrontational contraposing of environmental and developmental concerns. \r\nAvoidance of these extremes was in itself the result of the most \r\nsignificant characteristics of the whole UNCED process; a sharp focus on the \r\nhuman dimension, a solid grasp of realities and a firm notion of democratic \r\ninvolvement. In addition to guaranteeing the success of Rio, these \r\ncharacteristics also contributed to the widening and strengthening of the \r\nprocess of multilateralism. \r\nPrinciple 1 of the Rio Declaration captures uniquely the right tone and \r\nbalance of the UHCED message, with its simple assertion that \r\n\"Human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. They are entitled to a healthy and productive life in \r\nharmony with nature.\" (A/COHF.151/26 (Vol. I), p. 8) \r\nThis spirit of serene commitment pointing towards a common objective must \r\ncontinue to guide the international community, especially at these initial \r\npost-conference organizational stages, when the pressures of parochial and \r\nsectoral interests tend to come to the fore. \r\nRio imposed obligations on all of us, at the level of individuals, of \r\nStates, and of the international community as a whole. The definition of \r\nthese obligations takes account of a vast range of factors and situations, of \r\nspecific interests and universal concerns, of needs and capabilities, of \r\nhistorical facts and current conditions. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n60 \r\n(Mr. Camilleri. Malta) \r\nThe specific burdens imposed upon different sectors of the international \r\ncommtinity as a follow-up to Rio may vary in the light of such considerations. \r\nHhat must not be lost sight of is the fact that the final goal is equally \r\nvital to all: a healthy, viable and prosperous planet for future generations \r\nto inherit. \r\nIssues related to finance and technology permeate most of the action \r\nprogramme elaborated under Agenda 21 and must inevitably become the dominant \r\nthemes of the eventual follow-up process. In a number of ways finance and \r\ntechnology may be regarded as two sides of the same coin. Together they \r\nconstitute the indispensable means through which we can all achieve our \r\ndefined objectives. Both are available in impressive amounts, though not \r\nalways in the right places or utilized effectively; both are dynamic elements \r\ncapable of expansion or deviation according to uses and priorities. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n61 \r\n(Mr. Camilleri. Malta) \r\nIn a nutshell, the outstanding success of Rio was the agreement by the \r\ninternational community to harness all available finance and technology in the \r\ncollective endeavour towards sustainable development. It is to be hoped that, \r\nmore than a formal consensus decision. Agenda 21 represents a genuine and \r\ndetermined commitment, a commitment that encompasses both the global \r\ndimensions of the objectives of sustainable development and the nature of the \r\nsacrifices that are called for at individual and community levels in the \r\nnecessary reordering of priorities, of life-styles and of economic management. \r\nThe task of building the institutional set-up and launching the \r\nadministrative process needed for the effective implementation of the \r\ndecisions taken at Rio falls to the current session of the General Assembly. \r\nIn considering the question of institutional arrangements, we are privileged \r\nto benefit from the report of the Secretary-General in document A/47/598, a \r\nreport marked by the clarity, comprehensiveness and intellectual grasp of all \r\nrelevant issues that we have become accustomed to expect from our \r\nSecretary-General. \r\nI wish to commend three particularly helpful elements of the report; its \r\nsuccinct definition of the functions and the related structures of the \r\nproposed Commission on Sustainable Development; its consideration of the \r\nCommission\u0027s work within the broader picture of the United Hations system\u0027s \r\nevolving capacity in the economic, social and related fields; and its \r\nrecognition that the necessary secretariat support structure should be an \r\nintegral element\u0027in the current revitalization and reform efforts within the \r\nwhole United Hations Secretariat. \r\nMy delegation welcomes the emphasis the Secretary-General places in his \r\nreport on the role of the proposed high-level advisory body on sustainable \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Camilleri. Malta) \r\ndevelopment, and supports the idea that the work of that body should be \r\nintegrated with that of the existing Committee for Development Planning. \r\nWe also attach importance to the Agenda 21 recommendation that the \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development should encourage the participation of \r\nnon-governmental organizations, including those of industry and business and \r\nthe scientific communities. He see in these aspects the necessary guarantee \r\nthat the follow-up process to the Conference will remain closely linked to the \r\nfundamental needs and concerns of the global community. \r\nAgenda 21 looks beyond the functional aspects of the follow-up to the Rio \r\ndecisions by envisaging a process of overall review and appraisal at the \r\nhighest policy-making levels. The General Assembly, as the principal \r\npolicy-making and appraisal organ of the United Hations system, will be \r\nundertaking this task at given intervals, with the first special session for \r\nthe purpose to take place no later than 1997. \r\nMy delegation nevertheless feels that the United Hations system could \r\nprovide a more regular and consistent review and appraisal process detached \r\nboth from the day-to-day functional concerns of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil and the new Commission and from the wide-ranging responsibilities of \r\nthe General Assembly itself. As my Prime Minister explained in his address to \r\nthe General Assembly on 28 September this year, this task could be assigned to \r\na revitalized Trusteeship Council, which progressively, as its traditional \r\ntasks are phased out, could take over the role of guardian and trustee of the \r\ncommon heritage of mankind. \r\nIn addition to institutional issues, the UNCED follow-up process requires \r\nthis session of the General Assembly to take a number of other decisions. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. Camilleri. Malta) \r\nnotably in connection with the convening of the global conferences on \r\nstraddling and migratory fish stocks and on the sustainable development of \r\nsmall islands, as well as with the launching of negotiations on a framework \r\nconvention on desertification. \r\nAs a small island State, Malta attaches special importance to the \r\nconference on the sustainable development of small islands, which is proposed \r\nto be held in Barbados next June. Together with other members of the Alliance \r\nof Small Island States, Malta played an active, and we believe a useful, role \r\nin the UHCED process. \r\nHe are particularly proud of the role we have played in generating the \r\nnecessary awareness that led to the adoption of the Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change. Small islands are particularly vulnerable to climate change, \r\nespecially through its effect on the seas, with which their lives are so \r\nintimately linked, nevertheless, climate change, and especially its impact on \r\nglobal warming, is not a phenomenon that exclusively affects small islands, as \r\nthe concerns with desertification, for example, clearly underline. The \r\nquestion of climate change and the catalytic role small islands have played in \r\ndeveloping awareness about it therefore constitute one example of how, on \r\nissues related to environment and development, the special concerns of some \r\nare intertwined within the general concerns of all. \r\nThe commonality of our concerns and destiny within a single global \r\ncommunity, which stretches both horizontally in space and vertically in time, \r\nis indeed the most essential and profound message emerging from Rio. It is up \r\nto us to generate the necessary courage, wisdom and determination to \r\naccomplish those tasks whose completion is called for through the acceptance \r\nof this message. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n64 \r\nMr. ERDOS (Hungary): The United Hations Conference on Environment \r\nand Development (UHCED) opened a new chapter in the history of man\u0027s \r\nrelationship to nature. The Earth Summit was unprecedented in the scope of \r\nits work, the level of participation, the scale of governmental and \r\nnon-governmental involvement and the extent of its public impact. In the \r\nlight of the many opposing interests that had to be brought to bear, the Earth \r\nSummit achieved more than had been expected. \r\nnever again shall we be able to talk about \"environment\" and \r\n\"development\" as separate terms. Due to an endangered environment and to \r\nlimited resources, it will be necessary in the 1990s to promote growth \r\naccording to the principles of sustainable development. However, translating \r\nthe concept of sustainable development into specific international and \r\nnational programmes is more difficult than was thought at the beginning of the \r\nprocess. \r\nAware of the great importance of global environmental problems and \r\ngreatly concerned about the state of its own environment, Hungary followed the \r\nUHCED process with high expectations from the very beginning. Hhen Hungary \r\nsigned the Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological \r\nDiversity it was motivated not only by responsibility for the conditions \r\nprevailing on its own territory, but by concern for the state of the common \r\nheritage of humankind as well. At the same time, to deal with the environment \r\nin a development context presents not only an enormous chance but also \r\ndifficult challenges for countries like mine that have been undergoing a \r\nhistoric transition. \r\nUnforeseen and unforeseeable radical changes have taken place over the \r\npast two years in the post-communist countries. Those countries now have to \r\nface not only the problems of technological and infrastructural gap, economic \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n65 \r\n(Mr. Erdos, Hungary) \r\nrecession and social tensions that inevitably accompany the transition \r\nprocess, but also the tragic environmental legacy of the former regimes. \r\nOne such example is the Gabcikovo-Hagymaros Barrage System on the river \r\nDanube. Back in 1977 the Governments of Hungary and Czechoslovakia signed a \r\ntreaty on the construction and joint operation of the barrage system, without \r\ntaking into account its possible environmental effects. During the years that \r\nfollowed the commencement of the project the Hungarian public\u0027s attention \r\nbegan to focus more and more on the need to prevent a further forcible \r\ninterference in our habitat and to protect the country\u0027s and the region\u0027s \r\nunique environment and natural resources. This led to a popular \r\nreconsideration of ecological values, which are not always measurable in \r\neconomic terms, and to acceptance of the key idea that in the prudent \r\nmanagement of natural resources sustainable development is a basic principle. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n66 \r\n(Mr. Erd\u003c/s. Hungary) \r\nBecause of the severity of the ecological danger that completion of the \r\nbarrage system on the Danube would pose, the Hungarian Government was left \r\nwith no option but to terminate the 1977 Treaty in accordance with a \r\nresolution of the Hungarian Parliament. It did so in May this year. The \r\nGovernment of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic and the Government of \r\nSlovakia still view the 1977 Treaty as being in force and continue its \r\nimplementation, including the unilateral diversion of the Danube border river \r\nto the territory of Slovakia. \r\nThe Hungarian Government is concerned about the irreversible damage that \r\nthe diversion of the Danube will inflict upon the region\u0027s environmental \r\nresources. The available and potential drinking water reserves of millions of \r\npeople are threatened. \r\nBeyond the ecological threats, the diversion of the Danube infringes upon \r\nHungarian sovereignty and territorial integrity, violates the provisions of \r\nthe peace treaties concluded after the First and Second Horld Wars, which \r\ndetermine the main course of navigation in this section of the Danube as the \r\nborder between Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and deprives Hungary of its lawful \r\njurisdiction over a major economic lifeline. These actions are at variance \r\nwith the spirit of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe \r\n(CSCE) process and with the provisions of the United Hations Charter. \r\nUnfortunately, they also help revive the passions of post-communist \r\nnationalism. \r\nThe Charter of the United nations, customary international law and \r\nseveral bilateral and multilateral treaties binding on Czechoslovakia and \r\nHungary oblige these countries to negotiate in good faith and in a spirit of \r\ncooperation. Hungary has been, and continues to be, ready for meaningful \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n67 \r\n(Mr. Erdos. Hungary) \r\nnegotiations with Czechoslovakia on how to reconcile the conflicting sets of \r\ninterests. We are convinced that it is possible to find a mutually acceptable \r\nsolution to this problem in accordance with both international legal and \r\nenvironmental norms, taking due account of ecological and economic \r\nconsiderations alike. \r\nThere is a national consensus in Hungary that the state of our \r\nenvironment should be improved and further damage to it prevented. Hungary is \r\ncommitted to an open, participatory and monitored management of its \r\nenvironment. For this purpose, an institutionalized form of communication \r\nbetween Government and society is to be established. It will include full \r\naccess to information and a systematic and legalized role for non-governmental \r\norganizations. \r\nWe are living in a period characterized by a remarkable, though uneven, \r\ndevelopment of the world economy on the one hand, and by reckless plundering \r\nof natural resources and the destruction of the environment on the other. \r\nFully aware of this challenge, Hungary is ready to cooperate with all \r\ncountries in making the UHCED follow-up process a success. \r\nThe Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 have established a new dimension of \r\nlong-term international commitments. We would like to see the current legal \r\nand institutional mechanisms of global and regional cooperation developed \r\nfurther so as to enable environmental considerations to influence economic, \r\nsocial and scientific programmes, too. \r\nWe agree that follow-up institutions are needed to determine the global \r\nand regional activities resulting from the Rio Conference. The overall \r\nobjective of integrating environment and development issues at national, \r\nsubregional, regional and international levels should be stressed, with a view \r\nto ensuring the implementation of Agenda 21 in all countries. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n68 \r\n(Mr. Erdos. Hungary) \r\nWe welcome the establishment of the high-level Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. In our view, the follow-up to UHCED should be fully incorporated \r\ninto the ongoing revitalization of the United nations economic and social \r\nsectors. During this process, careful consideration should be given to the \r\nmandate and functions of the high-level Commission as well as to its \r\nrelationship with other organizations and agencies in the United Hations \r\nfamily, especially the United Hations Environment Programme (UNEP). We think \r\nthat in this follow-up process the role of the regional Economic Commissions \r\nshould be strengthened as well. \r\nUndoubtedly, steps should be taken to implement Agenda 21 through, \r\ninter alia, the initiation of negotiations leading to the elaboration of \r\nbinding international instruments. Hungary favours a complex approach, by \r\nwhich global challenges, commitments, one\u0027s own economic capacities and \r\nInternational assistance efforts are all carefully taken into account when \r\nworking out national obligations. The viability of this approach has already \r\nbeen demonstrated during the negotiations on the Convention on Climate Change. \r\nThe current session of the General Assembly has the important task of \r\nadopting concrete decision:, related to the UHCED report and to a number of \r\nspecific recommendations of the Rio Conference. I can assure the President, \r\nthat the Hungarian delegation will participate actively in the deliberations \r\non this item. \r\nMr. KALPAGE (Sri Lanka): The United Hations Conference on Environment \r\nand Development (UHCED), held at Rio de Janeiro in June 1992, was a most \r\nsignificant event in human history. In this discussion on UHCED we are \r\naddressing one of the major issues before the current session of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n69-70 \r\n(Mr. Kalpage. Sri Lent.) \r\nUNCED emphasized the concept that the environment is the common concern \r\nof humanity. It also stressed that the lasting solution to global \r\nenvironmental problems lies in sustainable development. We agreed at UHCED \r\nthat these problems should be redressed through multilateral cooperation based \r\non common but differentiated responsibilities, common action and a balanced \r\nperspective. Such cooperation should ensure that the protection of the \r\nenvironment, economic growth and development, and poverty eradication are \r\nmutually reinforcing. It is imperative to integrate development and \r\nenvironmental concerns. The welfare of the human being should be at the \r\ncentre of our concerns. \r\nThe international community\u0027s follow-up action to UNCED should be in \r\nkeeping with these concepts, developed and agreed to at Rio. It is important \r\nthat the momentum of our efforts to reach the goals envisaged in the Rio \r\nDeclaration be maintained in a spirit of cooperation. \r\nIn charting our course towards sustainable development, we should bear in \r\nmind the agreed principles enunciated in the Declaration as well as in the \r\nUnited Hations Charter. To achieve sustainable development globally. Member \r\nStates must have the political will and commitment to work out and implement \r\nnational strategies that will promote sustainable growth and lifestyles. To \r\nthis end. States should reduce and eliminate unsustainable patterns of \r\nproduction and consumption and promote appropriate demographic policies. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n71 \r\n(Mr. Kalpage. Sri Lanka) \r\nInternational cooperation is essential to strengthen endogenous capacity-\r\nbuilding for sustainable development by enhancing the development, adaptation, \r\ndiffusion and transfer to developing countries, on concessional and \r\npreferential terms, of technologies, including new and innovative \r\ntechnologies. \r\nCooperation between States to promote a supportive and open international \r\neconomic system cannot be over-emphasized. In this regard the successful \r\nconclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations is crucial to facilitate \r\nthe generation of financial resources through trade. The financial resource \r\nrequirement for the implementation of Agenda 21 is extremely large. A \r\nsubstantial flow of new and additional resources is necessary to facilitate \r\nthe mobilization of resources in developing countries. \r\nIt is important to set up effective financial mechanisms to facilitate \r\nthe flow of financial resources for the implementation of global as well as \r\nnational projects. The Global Environment Facility, as one of the financial \r\nmechanisms for the implementation of Agenda 21, must be restructured as \r\ndiscussed at Rio. \r\nThe cooperation and initiative of all countries and all sections of \r\nsociety, including women, youth and indigenous people as well as other major \r\ngroups and non-governmental organizations, are vital in the achievement of \r\nsustainable development. The problems of poverty, hunger, ill-health and \r\nilliteracy and the continuing deterioration of the ecosystems on which we \r\ndepend for our well-being can be addressed successfully only through a global \r\npartnership for sustainable development. \r\nThe immediate task before us is to establish the institutional \r\narrangements to carry forward the implementation of Agenda 21. My delegation \r\nsupports the setting up of a Commission on Sustainable Development, in \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n72 \r\n(Mr. Kalpage. Sri L̂ nV̂ ) \r\naccordance with Article 68 of the Charter of the United Hations. In this \r\nregard, we endorse the views expressed by the representative of Pakistan on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77. We believe that a highly qualified and competent \r\nsecretariat support structure within the United Nations Secretariat is \r\nessential to facilitate the Commission\u0027s work. \r\nIn addition to the institutional arrangements, other issues requiring \r\nspecial action are desertification and the problems of small island developing \r\ncountries. He support the establishment of an intergovernmental committee to \r\nformulate a convention on desertification. He also support the holding in \r\nJune 1993 of the global conference on the sustainable development of small \r\nisland developing countries. \r\nThe cooperation displayed at Rio must be nurtured. It must guide us on \r\nthe road from Rio in the years to come. Let us hope that our cooperative \r\nefforts will make this planet a better place for everyone, everywhere. \r\nMr. CISSE (Senegal) (interpretation from French): The Earth Summit \r\nmarked a historic turning-point in international relations by arousing an \r\nunprecedented awareness of the major importance of the environment to the \r\nworld as a whole and the need to establish a new world order reconciling the \r\ninterdependent and complementary imperatives of maintaining peace and \r\ninternational security, protecting the environment, promoting economic growth \r\nand development and eliminating poverty. It is agreed that the Conference \r\ngave a new impetus to the process of creating a global partnership on the \r\nenvironment and development. \r\nIn this respect, addressing the General Assembly on 30 September this \r\nyear. His Excellency President Abdou Diouf said: \r\n\"the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro last June has given us reason \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n73-75 \r\n(Mr. Cisse. Senegal) \r\nfor greater optimism. Indeed, while far from perfect, it worked for the \r\ntaking into account, in the long term, of all the concerns and \r\nperspectives of the world. It is not an exaggeration to say that after \r\nRio nothing is the same as before in approaching environmental problems \r\nand their interrelationship with development. Hhat is even better, the \r\nchange that has taken place thanks to a real awareness of the \r\nglobalization of mankind\u0027s problems could be the dawn of the new world \r\norder.\" (A/47/PV.18. p. 18) \r\nThe results of the United Hations Conference on Environment and \r\nDevelopment (UHCED) will bear fruit if specific action is taken quickly to \r\nfollow up the commitments made at the highest level regarding implementation \r\nof Agenda 21, particularly as regards financial resources and the transfer of \r\ntechnology; the establishment under Article 68 of the Charter of the United \r\nHations of a high-level Commission on Sustainable Development; and the \r\ndrafting of an international convention to combat desertification in countries \r\nexperiencing serious drought or desertification, particularly in Africa. \r\nI turn first to financial resources and technology transfer. He would \r\ninsist that the developed countries prove their political will to fulfil the \r\nundertakings they made when they supported the adoption of Agenda 21. In this \r\nrespect, my delegation hopes that the pledging conference to take place during \r\nthis session will be the occasion for the countries that can do so to provide \r\ninformation about their initial financial commitments. Hot only should those \r\ndeveloped countries which have not yet attained the 0.7 per cent of gross \r\nnational product set by the United Hations as the goal for official \r\ndevelopment assistance do so as quickly as possible; above all, the specific \r\ncommitments in chapter 33 concerning new and additional financial resources \r\nfor the developing countries must be respected. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n76 \r\n(Mr. Cisse. Senegal) \r\nMoreover, existing mechanisms and financial sources should play a key \r\nrole in the implementation of Agenda 21. In this connection, the \r\nInternational Development Association (IDA), during the tenth replenishment of \r\nits resources, should be able, with the assistance of the Horld Bank, to \r\nfinance integrated national environmental projects through the establishment \r\nof the Earth increment. \r\nAs for the Global Environment Facility (GEF), its restructuring, its \r\ndemocratic and transparent administration and the periodic evaluation of its \r\nactivities will enable it to become the major financing mechanism for \r\nAgenda 21. In this respect, Senegal will play an active role at the meeting \r\nscheduled for December in Cote d\u0027lvoire within the framework of the \r\nrestructuring of the GEF mechanism. \r\nAs for the role that the specialized agencies are to play in helping the \r\ndeveloping countries implement the Rio de Janeiro decisions, the delegation of \r\nSenegal welcomes the Capacity 21 initiative launched by the United Hations \r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), which is designed to assist developing countries \r\nin preparing and administering their own development plans. This initiative, \r\ninvolving an expenditure of more than $100 million, will help these countries \r\nto give concrete effect to Agenda 21 and to launch effective national \r\nprogrammes by increasing the expertise of developing countries\u0027 national \r\ninstitutions, which will enable them to follow up on the commitments entered \r\ninto at Rio de Janeiro. \r\nCapacity 21, in order to bear fruit, should, when implemented, operate on \r\nthe basis of an integrated approach, taking into account the priorities and \r\nobjectives of the recipient countries with regard to the environment and \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n77 \r\n(Mr. Cisse. Senegal) \r\ndevelopment. Moreover, the role of regional banks in financing Agenda 21 \r\nshould not be overlooked. Lastly, the mobilization of resources for the \r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 should go hand in hand with debt-relief measures \r\nand increased private financing as well as more investment. Along these \r\nlines, the convening of an international conference to finance development \r\nwould play a decisive role. \r\nI should now like to touch on the no less important question of \r\ninstitutional arrangements, basically the establishment of the high-level \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development. This Commission will be a driving \r\nforce in the attainment of the main objectives of Agenda 21 and will promote \r\nthe strengthening of international cooperation for sustainable development. \r\nIt will have a decisive role in promoting the integration of the environment \r\nand development at the United Nations system level and in reviewing the \r\nprogress achieved in the implementation of Agenda 21 at the national, regional \r\nand subregional levels, including financial contributions and transfers of \r\ntechnology to the developing countries. \r\nThe Commission should have a clear and specific mandate, avoiding any \r\nduplication with other organs and taking into account the process for \r\nrestructuring and revitalizing the United Nations system in the economic and \r\nsocial fields. Moreover, its composition should reflect an equitable \r\ngeographical distribution. Coordination of the activities relate to \r\nintegrating environment and development at the level of the United Nations \r\n. system is vital. Likewise, the secretariat to be established should consist \r\n, of highly qualified persons chosen on the basis of their competence and with \r\nI the broadest possible geographical distribution. This secretariat should be \r\nled by a high-ranking official under the direction of the Secretary-General. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n78 \r\n(Mr. Cisse. Senegal) \r\nAs regards the headquarters of the Commission, the Government of Senegal \r\nhas taken note with interest of the offer of the Government of Switzerland. \r\nThe delegation of Senegal hopes that the current negotiations will lead \r\nto the adoption of a resolution in which the General Assembly will determine \r\nthe specific organizational modalities for the work of the high-level \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development, in particular its membership, its \r\nrelationship with other intergovernmental United Hations bodies dealing with \r\nmatters related to environment and development, and the frequency, duration \r\nand venue of its meetings. \r\nA source of major concern for my delegation is the precariousness of the \r\nenvironment in Africa, exacerbated by the encroachment of deserts and the \r\ndevastating drought which led to the death of approximately 3 million people \r\nin sub-Saharan Africa in the 1980s and which is currently inflicting enormous \r\ndamage on the southern part of the continent. Despite national, regional and \r\ninternational efforts, particularly within the context of programmes such as \r\nthe Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel and the \r\nSahara-Sahel observatory, the situation has worsened and has required \r\nlarge-scale global action. In this respect, the decision taken by the United \r\nHations Conference on Environment and Development to establish an \r\nintergovernmental negotiating committee to draft an international convention \r\nto combat desertification, especially in Africa, has come just in time. The \r\nnegotiations under way at the present session should enable the Committee to \r\nstart its work in 1993 so as to complete the drafting of the convention before \r\nJune 1994. The convention should contain provisions on measures designed to \r\nput an end to and reverse the trends towards increased desertification as well \r\nas measures to control and prevent drought situations. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n79-80 \r\n(Mr. Cisse. Senegal) \r\nClearly, the implementation by developing countries of such a legal \r\ninstrument will require firm commitments on the part of the international \r\ncommunity to the mobilization of financial resources, the transfer of \r\ntechnology and the provision of assistance in training and data collection. \r\nIn this context, the role of regional organizations such as the Permanent \r\nInter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel should be strengthened. \r\nThe delegation of Senegal wishes to reiterate the importance it attaches \r\nto other chapters of Agenda 21, in particular the beginning of an \r\ninternational process to review the principles on the protection of forests; \r\non the convening, as soon as possible, of an international conference on \r\nmigratory species and high-seas fishing; on the ratification and entry into \r\nforce of the Convention on Climate Change; on the establishment before 1993 by \r\nall States of national plans of action for the integration of environment and \r\ndevelopment. \r\nLastly, we also believe that there must be a review in 1997, in the \r\nmiddle of the follow-up to Rio process, to evaluate the progress achieved, \r\nboth within the United nations system and at the regional and national levels, \r\nin implementing the decisions adopted at the historic Earth Siunmit. That \r\nevaluation should include the status of the implementation of the convention \r\nto combat desertification, which is to be drafted. \r\nThe PRESIDEHT : In accordance with the decision taken by the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its 52nd plenary meeting, on 2 Hovember 1992, I now call \r\non the Observer of Switzerland. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n81 \r\nMr. ROCH (Switzerland) (interpretation from French): Switzerland \r\nmade a firm commitment to the process that culminated in the Earth Summit, \r\nheld in Rio last June. In our view, the exercise was a success overall. \r\nRio was an extraordinary Summit meeting, marking the convergence of the \r\nissues of development, protection of the environment and efficient resource \r\nmanagement. The wealth of exchanges of views throughout the Rio process, \r\nconsiderably enriched by the contributions of hundreds of non-governmental \r\norganizations, brought about a new way of thinking. How it is up to us to \r\ncreate a new way of acting. \r\nIn this regard, we should like first to repeat the commitments we and the \r\nrest of the community of States made in Rio de Janeiro. We signed the \r\nConventions on Climate Change and on Biodiversity, and adopted the Rio \r\nDeclaration, the Statement on forests and Agenda 21. We hope the members of \r\nthe General Assembly will formally adopt all the final documents of the \r\nConference. \r\nWe believe that the next steps to be taken on the road to sustainable \r\ndevelopment are crucial. First, the \"spirit of Rio\" must be implemented in \r\neach of our countries. In Switzerland, the federal Government is currently \r\nreviewing Agenda 21 to identify all the recommendations that it must now take \r\ninto account. At the same time, efforts are being made to involve local \r\nofficials, as well as the population and non-governmental organizations in \r\nthis work. Their support and their motivated, active participation are \r\nessential if we are to make the very important adjustments needed in a highly \r\nindustrialized country such as ours. We hope before the end of the year to be \r\nable to identify a number of areas for priority action and to begin work on \r\nthem. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n82 \r\n(Mr. Roch. Switzerland) \r\nIt is now clear that one of our major actions will be to implement a \r\nseries of measures to meet the objective of reducing emissions of gases \r\ncausing the greenhouse effect. \r\nNow more than ever, one of our objectives is to have environmental \r\nfactors taken into account in the setting of prices and, in particular to use \r\neconomic instruments such as a tax on carbon dioxide emissions, to protect the \r\nenvironment. Apart from the theoretical work involved in this approach work \r\nthat is by and large under way there is the question of a minimum \r\ninternational harmonization to avoid trade distortions and guarantee the \r\neffectiveness of these instruments. We hope that a consensus will be reached \r\nas speedily as possible. We will spare no effort to this end, particularly in \r\nthe European context. \r\nThis leads me to measures that should be taken internationally. First, \r\nSwitzerland is convinced of the need to undertake without delay the work \r\nnecessary for the development and implementation of the two Conventions signed \r\nin Rio. This afternoon in the Second Committee we will have the opportunity \r\nto return to questions concerning the Convention on Climate Change. \r\nSwitzerland is also convinced that the convention on desertification \r\nproposed by the African group could improve and facilitate international \r\nefforts to control land degradation. That is why it welcomes the forthcoming \r\nwork on this new legal instrument, in whose elaboration it will participate \r\nactively. \r\nMoreover, we attach the greatest importance to the establishment of a \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development, with a strong and substantial mandate, \r\nto be a future forum for constructive and effective debate on everything \r\nrelated to the implementation of Agenda 21. Overall, we welcome the \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n83 \r\n(Mr. Roch. Switzerland) \r\nrecommendations in this regard in the report of the Secretary-General on \r\ninstitutional follow up of the United Nations Conference on Enviroiunent and \r\nDevelopment (UNCED). \r\nMore specifically, Switzerland supports the idea that the Commission \r\nshould allow for the fullest possible participation of States, whether or not \r\nthey are Members of the United Nations, and specialized agencies of the \r\nsystem. The choice of Commission members should reflect the criteria of \r\nequitable geographical distribution. Non-Member States should have observer \r\nstatus, defined in such a way that they may fully participate in its work. \r\nNon-governmental organizations, too, should be able to play an active part in \r\nthe Commission\u0027s work. The model of cooperation developed for UNCED and its \r\npreparatory committees should serve as a basis for thinking about this matter. \r\nThe Commission should be supported by a secretariat of the highest \r\ncalibre, particularly as it should be capable of providing considerable \r\nassistance to coordination efforts within the United Hations system, such as \r\nthose of the Administrative Committee on Coordination. \r\nHe are fully aware that establishing the Commission and its secretariat \r\nraises numerous difficult questions at a time when the system and the \r\nSecretariat are going through an active phase of restructuring and \r\nrevitalization. Moreover, the concept of sustainable development reinforces \r\nthe interdependence of the specialized agencies and institutions responsible \r\nfor work in this field. The harmonization and coordination of the various \r\ncomponents of the system, the simplification of lines of decision-making and \r\nthe avoidance of duplication are therefore more necessary than ever. These \r\nchallenges, which are very important to us, require a certain flexibility at \r\nthis stage. In this regard, we are ready to take an active part in the \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n84-85 \r\n(Mr. Roch. Switzerland) \r\nnegotiations soon to be begun under the chairmanship of Ambassador Razali, \r\nwhich we believe will have positive results. \r\nAs for financing Agenda 21, which will involve considerable additional \r\ncosts, particularly for the developing countries, the Swiss Government, \r\nundertook during the Rio Conference to increase its official development \r\nassistance over time in order to play its full part in the necessary \r\ninternational effort. \r\nFinally, I repeat an offer made by my Government: Switzerland would be \r\npleased to contribute to the success of the follow-up of UHCED by hosting in \r\nGeneva meetings of the high-level Commission on Sustainable Development; by \r\nhaving the secretariat headquarters there; and by providing financial support. \r\nI should like to make it clear that no country should be prevented from \r\ntaking part in the Commission\u0027s work for lack of permanent representation in \r\nGeneva. Switzerland is prepared to make available in Geneva the necessary \r\ninfrastructure to enable least developed countries without permanent missions \r\nin Geneva to take part fully in the Commission\u0027s work. \r\nSwitzerland is also prepared to make available the necessary funding to \r\ncover the travel expenses of representatives of least developed countries that \r\ndo not have a permanent mission in Geneva, without excluding other countries. \r\nIt will submit detailed proposals on the matter to the Group of 77 next week. \r\nThe United Hations Conference on Environment and Development and its \r\nfollow-up offer us a unique opportunity. He should give ourselves the \r\nfinancial and political means to seize this opportunity and to emerge from the \r\nvicious circle of underdevelopment and destruction of the environment. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n86 \r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from Arabic): The representative of \r\nCzechoslovakia wished to make a statement in exercise of the right of reply, \r\nBefore calling on him, I remind members that in accordance with General \r\nAssembly decision 34/401 statements in exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first statement and to 5 minutes for the second \r\nstatement and should be made by delegations from their seats. \r\nI cal on the representative of Czechoslovakia. \r\nMr. KUKAN (Czechoslovakia): I wish to react to that part of the \r\nstatment of my colleague the Permanent Representative of Hungary which dealt \r\nwith the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros project. I shall use this opportunity to present \r\nthe position of my Government on that issue. \r\nThe Gabcikovo-Hagymaros project is for a barrage system on the Danube \r\njointly designed and agreed upon by Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Hhile both \r\nparts of the project were intended to provide energy and to ameliorate \r\nnavigation conditions, one of the main motives for the project has always been \r\nflood protection. \r\nDuring the years following the signature of the 1977 treaty on this \r\nproject, construction amounting to $1.5 billion was carried out, mainly on the \r\nCzechoslovak side of the project. When Hungary proposed first to slow down \r\nthe work in 1981, invoking financial problems, and then, contrariwise, to \r\nspeed up the termination of the project by 15 months, in February 1989, \r\nCzechoslovakia responded with understanding. In May 1989 Hungary decided \r\nwithout any consultation with Czechoslovakia to suspend the construction of \r\nthe Hagymaros part of the project, which lies entirely on Hungarian territory. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n87 \r\n(Mr. Kukan, Czechoslovakia) \r\nand two months later also to suspend work on the Hungarian sector of the \r\nGabcikovo part of the project, which is situated mainly on Czechoslovak \r\nterritory, ignoring at the same time all damage claims by Czechoslovakia, \r\nwhich were based on relevant treaty provisions. \r\nIn October 1989 the Hungarian Parliament, invoking as a general argument \r\nthe priority of ecological interests, decided to stop permanently the \r\nconstruction of the Hagymaros part of the project, and in April 1990 empowered \r\nthe Hungarian Government to propose to Czechoslovakia the termination of the \r\n1977 treaty, the dismantling of all construction carried out during those 12 \r\nyears, and the restoration of the original state of the area. Since that time \r\nHungary has insisted on this as the only subject for negotiations with \r\nCzechoslovakia, continuously refusing to discuss any other solution, including \r\nthe possibility of revising the technical elements of the project, a revision \r\nwhich would be based on thorough studies undertaken by experts from both \r\ncountries, with the participation of impartial experts. \r\nThe environmental impact of the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros project were \r\nthoroughly reevaluated by several expert commissions in Czechoslovakia. The \r\nresult of those studies was that the best solution would be to complete the \r\nwhole project in accordance with the 1977 treaty, with certain additional \r\nmeasures aimed at diminishing, or even eliminating, the identified undesired \r\nenvironmental impacts. No threat of an \"environmental catastrophe\", as so \r\noften referred to by Hungary, was found. \r\nIn order to obtain the complete picture, even the possibility of \r\nabandoning the project and completely rehabilitating the area was studied. It \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n88 \r\n(Mr. Kukan. CzechoslovaH^) \r\nwas concluded that, at this stage of the work, it is technically impossible to \r\nrestore the original productive state of the territory, as far as the \r\nGabchikovo part of the project is concerned. \r\nHaving duly considered the existing situation, the Czechoslovak \r\nGovernment decided in July 1991, after having previously notified the \r\nHungarian Government, to proceed with a provisional solution, the so-called \r\nvariant C of the Gabcikovo project. This consists of putting that part of the \r\nproject into operation, at least the structures situated on Czechoslovak \r\nterritory. This solution of last resort was the only possibile way of \r\ndiminishing the great economic losses that Czechoslovakia has suffered as a \r\nresult of Hungary\u0027s non-compliance with its treaty obligations. During the \r\ntwo and a half years of the delay, the economic loss for Czechoslovakia has \r\nbeen at least 15 billion crowns, that is, more than half a billion dollars. \r\nEven more than the financial aspect, we feel the burden of the urgent need for \r\nflood protection and for stopping the environmental deterioration of the area. \r\nDuring the work on the provisional solution, Czechoslovakia was always \r\nready to seek a solution to the disputed questions with Hungary, and welcomed \r\nthe readiness of the Commission of the European Community to provide \r\nassistance and to chair a trilateral committee of experts. On 16 May 1992 \r\nHungary declared the 1977 treaty unilaterally terminated, effective \r\n25 May 1992. That act, contrary to the relevant rules of the law of treaties, \r\nis considered by Czechoslovakia to have no legal effect. The 1977 treaty of \r\nthe Gabcikovo-Hagymaros project remains valid. \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n89 \r\n(Mr. Kukan, Czechoslovakia) \r\nIn August 1992 Czechoslovakia duly notified the Danube Commission about \r\nthe final work in the bed of the Danube planned for the last part of October, \r\nwhich required the suspension of navigation for about 10 days. Owing to \r\nclimatic conditions, this work can be done only in the autumn, when the water \r\nlevel is low. \r\nAccordingly between 24 and 31 October a provisional closure dike was \r\nbuilt in the river bed. The navigation channel was filled, and on 2 Hovember \r\nwas opened to navigation by the terms of the 1977 treaty, nevertheless, \r\nCzechoslovakia did not stait the reservoir, thus limiting the operation of the \r\nsystem to the navigation channel. The power plant was consequently not put \r\ninto operation. The whole quantity of water again runs in the original river \r\noed. The measures that have been adopted are of a provisional and reversible \r\ncharacter. They do not exclude the possibility of putting into operation the \r\nwhole Gabcikovo part of the project, including the construction on Hungarian \r\nterritory. \r\nThe provisional solution and the construction of the Gabcikovo-Hagymaros \r\nproject by the terms of the 1977 treaty cannot and do not produce any change \r\nin the border between the two countries. Indeed, the 1977 treaty contains an \r\nexplicit provision in that respect. \r\nAt the tripartite meeting of the representatives of Czechoslovakia, \r\nHungary and the Commission of the European Community held on 28 October 1992 \r\nin London, it was agreed that on a date specified by the European Community \r\nCommission on the basis of the report submitted by the tripartite fact-finding \r\nmission, all the work on variant C of the project would be stopped. A working \r\nA/47/PV.56 \r\n90 \r\n(Mr. Kukan, Czechoslnv»tij) \r\ngroup of experts, including specialists in environmental matters, hydrology \r\nand water architecture, will be set up immediately with the mandate to make an \r\non-site inspection of the structures of variant C and to assess factors \r\npertaining to all aspects of those structures. \r\nBoth Czechoslovakia and Hungary have committed themselves to submitting \r\nthe whole dispute connected with the Gabcikovo-Hagymaros project, in all its \r\naspects, to binding international arbitration or to the International Court of \r\nJustice. \r\nIn conclusion, I want to reiterate the strong interest of the \r\nCzechoslovak Government in solving the issue through meaningful and \r\nbusinesslike negotiations. We believe that political slogans or accusations \r\nof any kind will not help this cause. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.20 p.m. \r\n"
