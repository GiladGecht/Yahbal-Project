In this connection, the General \r\nAssembly will take up agenda item 8 tomorrow evening, at a meeting to begin at \r\n9 p.m. \r\nADDRESS BY MR. CESAR GAVIRIA TRUJILLO, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia. \r\nMr. Cesar Gaviria Truiillo. President of the Republic of Colombia, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic of Colombia, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\nPresident GAVIRIA TRUJILLO (interpretation from Spanish): I should \r\nlike to begin by extending a warm welcome to the new States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations. Colombia hopes to be allied with all of them as they strive \r\nto consolidate the growth of democracy. I should also like to congratulate \r\nthe President on his election to lead this session of the Assembly, and to \r\nexpress our recognition of the leadership and effectiveness shown by \r\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in making the United Nations the home \r\nof peace, development and progress for humanity. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n3 \r\n(President Gaviria Truiillo) \r\nI address all gathered here today at the General Assembly with a profound \r\nfeeling of sorrow, because at this moment thousands of defenceless people are \r\nvictims of the war against Bosnia and Herzegovina and because in Somalia \r\nthousands are dying of hunger. I would urge the General Assembly of the \r\nUnited Nations to take at this session a decisive step forward in resolving \r\nthese world conflicts. \r\nAmong the trends that nourish our hopes for the future of mankind, we \r\nshould highlight the decisive role that the United Nations has undertaken to \r\nplay as a catalyst of the new global agenda. But the Organization still has \r\nmany of the features inherited from the cold-war period. Reforms must move \r\nforward with prudence and patience, but also with the certainty that the \r\ndecision-making mechanisms of the United Nations will be more democratic, more \r\nequal, more representative and more effective. Only then will we be able to \r\nadvance the future role of the United Nations. The \"Agenda for Peace\" \r\npresented by the Secretary-General is certainly a guideline for our \r\nachievement of these objectives. \r\nIn the past, when the world was divided into two- irreconcilable poles, it \r\nwas almost impossible to reach agreement even on the simplest of ideas. But \r\nnow conditions exist for multilateral organizations to become the principal \r\nactors of the new world order. But here too we must call for caution. The \r\nkey problems of the new world agenda cannot be resolved without the active \r\nparticipation of developing nations. This new principal role in the \r\nmanagement of the international agenda must be recognized by the \r\nindustrialized countries if we are to make truly viable a multilateral \r\napproach based on mutual cooperation. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n4-5 \r\n(President Gaviria Truiillo) \r\nAt the same time, the industrialized nations cannot continue using \r\nmultilaterism selectively. Also, the developed countries will have to abandon \r\nthe practice of using multilateral organizations as mere instruments to \r\nlegitimize their unilateral decisions. This is a double standard that puts at \r\nrisk the success of multilateral solutions. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n6 \r\n(President Gaviria Truiillo) \r\nFive hundred years ago, thanks to the courage of Columbus, the meeting of \r\ntwo worlds that were separated by fear and ignorance became possible. Because \r\nof his accomplishment the planet became one, awakening mankind to undreamt of \r\nhorizons of progress and well-being. \r\nOnly a few decades ago the cold war separated the world into two once \r\nagain. During that time people were not separated into isolated continents \r\nbut into opposing blocs divided by an immense ocean of distrust and hate. \r\nNow, as the world celebrates the five hundredth anniversary of the discovery, \r\nhumanity once again has an opportunity to forge a truly global community. \r\nThe joy of liberated peoples dancing on top of crumbling walls is, alas, \r\nfleeting. Democracy in Europe and America has shown that it is not enough to \r\ndefeat dictatorship in order to achieve true freedom. The tyranny of poverty, \r\ndrugs, terrorism, fratricidal war, stagnation and paper democracies continues \r\nto be an unavoidable threat to peace, security and well-being. Perhaps things \r\ndid seem easier in the past when we believed we had just one enemy communism \r\nor militarism. Now we can see more clearly the real evils afflicting mankind. \r\nEven though there are powerful reasons for optimism about the future, we \r\ncannot give up our enthusiasm thinking these difficulties have now all been \r\novercome. We have a new agenda which we must begin to undertake with the same \r\neffort and dedication with which the cold war was fought. \r\nThe road to a new international order is plagued by paradoxes. While the \r\ndeveloping nations are embracing the benefits of free trade, the \r\nindustrialized nations are sticking to protectionist barriers and creating new \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n7 \r\n(President Gaviria Truiillo) \r\nrestrictive trade procedures. At the very moment these trends are occurring \r\nthe industrialized nations are cheerfully proclaiming to the four winds the \r\ntriumph of the free market. \r\nIf the world economy continues along the road of protectionism the \r\npossibilities of creating a new international order based politically on \r\ndemocratic principles and economically on individual freedoms will continue to \r\nrecede. Without access to markets we will not be able to achieve the levels \r\nof economic development necessary to defeat poverty and to promote a climate \r\nof world peace. Confronting this return to protectionism must be one of the \r\nprincipal contributions to peace and the progress of mankind. \r\nIt is equally paradoxical that, when events signal a new era of \r\ninternational solidarity, symptoms of growing isolationism exist. The \r\nindustrialized countries are focusing increasingly on their internal affairs, \r\nsidestepping their obligation to contribute to peace and progress in the \r\nglobal community. \r\nA world in which hundreds of millions live in poverty without any hope of \r\na better life cannot afford the luxury of egoism. The wealthier countries \r\ncannot turn their backs on these multitudes by proclaiming that all of \r\nmankind\u0027s problems will be resolved by the invisible hand of the \r\nmarket-place. Now more than ever solidarity is essential. \r\nWhen East and West extended their confrontation to the furthest corners \r\nof the planet the developing countries enjoyed the most perverse dividend of \r\nthe conflict. There was never a lack of external resources to feed the \r\neuphoria of war. Now that the guns have been silenced, international \r\nassistance for democracy and for alleviating poverty is elusive. Now that \r\nthere is a need for generosity, and solidarity is the only argument put \r\nforward in support of it, the helping hand is withdrawn and the back is turned. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n8 \r\n(President Gaviria Truiillo) \r\nThe Earth Summit was certainly a milestone in the history of mankind. \r\nRio de Janeiro is the beginning of a long road that must be travelled to \r\nreconcile man with nature. Unfortunately there are dangerous trends in the \r\nindustrialized countries threatening international cooperation on \r\nenvironmental problems. \r\nFor example, there is the unilateral imposition of barriers and \r\nenvironmental conditions for our countries. This is not good policy. It \r\ncould lead to an unacceptable situation in which the North continues to \r\nadvance and pollute and the South remains poor in order to reduce the global \r\nenvironmental degradation caused by the industrialized nations. This new form \r\nof environmental protectionism is a source of conflict that must be dealt with. \r\nI know all too well that when Colombia\u0027s name is mentioned in the great \r\ncapitals of the world people inevitably think of drug-trafficking. \r\nUnfortunately this has been so because my people, armed only with their \r\nstrength and their courage, have had to take on an unequal and heroic lone \r\nbattle against the most powerful and most perverse criminals known to mankind. \r\nColombia is a victim of the uncontrollable appetite for drugs throughout \r\nthe world. Three days ago the bullets that killed a valiant Colombian judge, \r\nMyriam Rocio Velez, were bought with money from cocaine consumers. The bribes \r\nthat corrupt the law enforcement and prison authorities in our country come \r\nout of the pockets of drug addicts in the major capitals of the world. The \r\ndynamite used in car bombs that assassinate innocent citizens in the streets \r\nof Colombia is paid for with the money of those who consider their insatiable \r\nvice as harmless and innocent. \r\nIt hurts us even more that those who point an accusing finger at a \r\ncourageous people who have endured so many sacrifices are precisely those who \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n9 \r\n(President Gaviria Truiillo) \r\nhave no problem ignoring a neighbour who uses drugs, launders money, trafficks \r\nin arms, illegally exports precursor chemicals or runs drug distribution \r\nnetworks in streets and cities. \r\nThere is no doubt that in Colombia we have lost some battles and have \r\nsuffered severe setbacks, including the recent and widely publicized escape \r\nfrom prison of a group of well-known drug-traffickers. In spite of that \r\nbitter medicine we can say with pride that no other country in the world has \r\nfought the scourge of drugs with such resolve and success. \r\nThe treason of some corrupt officials who gave up their dignity for a \r\nhandful of dollars does not negate the sacrifices of the thousands of \r\nColombians who are fighting in defence of democracy and mankind. Hear me \r\nwell: it is true that Pablo Escobar escaped from jail but he will not escape \r\nfrom the firm resolve of Colombians to see justice done. \r\nI am convinced that by keeping to our legendary firmness, Colombia will \r\nsoon be liberated forever from violence and crime. But, unfortunately, \r\ndrug-trafficking is an international crime that threatens mankind in every \r\ncorner of the planet. It is not enough for only the Colombians to be valiant \r\nand victorious. \r\nToday in Colombia we have drug-traffickers, tomorrow they will be in \r\nsister nations. Today their enterprise is cocaine; tomorrow they will be \r\nlooking for other new, lucrative products such as heroin. Today they are \r\nmaking millions from the demand in the United States; tomorrow they will be \r\ngetting even richer with money from Europe and Japan. We are already seeing \r\nthese changes and these adaptations. \r\nDrug-trafficking is a hydra-headed monster; it is not enough to cut off \r\njust one head or only a few heads. To eradicate this scourge once and for all \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n10 \r\n(President Gaviria Truiillo) \r\nwe need to take decisive, collective action, international and multilateral \r\naction, against this evil on all fronts. \r\nTwo years ago I stood before the Assembly and called on all Members to \r\nwork together against drug-trafficking. Now we must ask the question: what \r\nhave we achieved since then? \r\nTwo years ago the drug cartels looked invincible, were even threatening \r\nto destroy democracy in Colombia and impose a reign of terror and violence. \r\nToday most of those enemies of society are dead or in jail. \r\nTwo years ago the industrialized world, with an accusing gesture, held \r\nresponsible for the problem those very countries that are in fact victims of \r\nthe production and processing of drugs. Today we know that the consumers of \r\ndrugs, are the source of the problem and cannot evade their responsibilities. \r\nTwo years ago international financial centres were accepting funds from \r\nthe most dubious sources without regard as to the propriety of their actions. \r\nToday we have started to see a change in attitude. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n11 \r\n(President Gaviria Truiillo) \r\nTwo years ago, drug trafficking was growing out of control. Today, from \r\none end to the other of the western hemisphere, we have achieved unprecedented \r\nlevels of drug interdiction. \r\nTwo years ago, the epidemic of drug use looked uncontainable. Today, we \r\nare certain that the demand for drugs can be controlled if the necessary \r\neconomic resources are made available. \r\nTwo years ago, no one recognized the close ties between poverty, the \r\nabsence of economic opportunity and the emergence of drug trafficking. Today, \r\nwe know that alternative development, trade opportunities and economic aid are \r\nneeded to overcome the drug problem. \r\nBut all this progress real progress is not enough. Drug trafficking \r\nadapts itself easily to the efforts of society to stamp it out. Criminal \r\norganizations, now not only in Colombia but practically all over the world, \r\nhave entered into this illegal business. While consumption is dropping in the \r\nUnited States, it is growing in Europe and Asia. \r\nToday, more than ever before, we must strengthen international \r\ncooperation in the struggle against this enemy of humanity. Today, more than \r\never, we need a vision of the future to guide our efforts and guarantee our \r\npeople that the problem can be overcome. That is why I want to challenge the \r\ninternational community today. I invite you join me in establishing clear \r\ngoals and measurable commitments so that all of us will know where we want to \r\ngo and when we hope to get there. In this way, we will be able to guide \r\npolitical decisions to generate the necessary resources. \r\nThat is also why I propose that the United Nations define global, \r\nregional and country targets for controlling the problem of drugs. We must \r\ncommit ourselves to reducing the supply of drugs and the demand for them by at \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n12 \r\n(President Gaviria Truiillp) \r\nleast 50 per cent by the year 2000, by 70 per cent by the year 2005, and free \r\nhumanity for ever from the scourge of drugs by the year 2010. \r\nAs of now, before the international community, Colombia assumes the \r\nresponsibility of complying with these objectives in its territory. We intend \r\nto enter the next century with sales of arms, the sale and diversion of \r\nprecursor chemicals and money-laundering activities under control. \r\nThe need to free humanity from the scourge of drugs requires a plan for \r\nglobal action. This is why I call on the General Assembly to hold a United \r\nNations conference on the problem of illicit drugs where the necessary \r\ncommitments and programmes would emerge to make it possible for drug \r\ntrafficking to be defeated completely in the next decade and a half. \r\nIt is beyond doubt that international criminal organizations have \r\nconsolidated their extensive network of ties and contacts much faster than the \r\njudicial system is capable of investigating and prosecuting those \r\nresponsible. The Italian judges Giovanna Falcone and Paolo Borsellino and the \r\nColombian judge Myriam Rocio Velez, along with very many others who have \r\nfallen in the fight against international organized crime, were facing \r\npowerful enemies; the existing laws and the mechanisms were not enough. \r\nThe individual courage of these heroes of justice is also not enough. \r\nThere must be no borders or barriers if those who have decided to unite in \r\nevil are to be prosecuted effectively everywhere on Earth. We need justice to \r\nbe universal, and for it to work in as coordinated a manner in all countries \r\nas the international criminal organizations do. The Mafia, cartels, camorra, \r\nand yakuza are just different names for the same thing. The time has come to \r\ntreat organized crime as an international crime. \r\nAs I said in my inaugural address, it is vital to develop an \r\ninternational criminal jurisdiction against drug trafficking, money laundering \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n13 \r\n(President Gaviria Truiillo) \r\nand the illegal export of precursor chemicals. Wherever the guilty live or \r\nserve their sentences, it must be possible for the courts in all countries to \r\nbe able, voluntarily, to have recourse to international courts where, in a \r\nsecure manner and with all the evidence available world wide, these many and \r\nserious crimes can be tried. Now is the time for the United Nations to tackle \r\nthis question in a serious, dedicated way. \r\nAlso, we must improve the machinery at our disposal for judicial \r\ncooperation between countries. That is why we would like to see a United \r\nNations convention for judicial cooperation on felonies that would facilitate \r\nthe flow of evidence, the standardization of testimony and supporting \r\ndocumentation, and reduce the bureaucratic procedures and legal obstacles to \r\ncoordinated action by the criminal legal systems of different countries. \r\nWe would also like to see real involvement by the European Community and \r\nby Japan and other countries in Asia in the Cartagena and San Antonio \r\nagreements and commitments. In Cartagena and San Antonio, the participating \r\ncountries agreed a set of strategies at all levels in the fight against drug \r\ntrafficking. This effort has already yielded results, but the moment has come \r\nto extend this cooperation to the rest of the world community. \r\nLastly, let me say that I believe that the experience acquired through \r\nall these years of the difficult fight against drug trafficking has given our \r\nauthorities some knowledge which, beyond a doubt, is of great value to many \r\nother countries which are starting to experience the consequences of the \r\nglobal spread of drug trafficking. This is why Colombia has decided to \r\nestablish an international centre for the fight against drug trafficking; this \r\nwill allow us to make available to the global community what we have learned \r\nthrough so much sacrifice. I invite the United Nations and all Member States \r\nto contribute to, and participate in, this initiative. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n14-15 \r\n(President Gaviria Truiillo) \r\nI know that in a short time, supported by my compatriots\u0027 courage and \r\nresolve to fight, by the valour of the judges of Colombia, by the greatness of \r\nthe people of my country, we shall not have to talk about violence and drug \r\ntrafficking here within the walls of the United Nations. Wars do not go on \r\nfor ever, and I do not recall a single criminal who has resisted the pressure \r\nof the will of an entire people; and, if my call today has been heard, those \r\ncriminal organizations will be even less able to resist the united will of the \r\ninternational community. \r\nPerhaps then, soon, when we leave behind the dark night of drug \r\ntrafficking, the world will see the other, friendlier face of my country, and \r\ndiscover what we really are: we are the strongest and oldest democracy in the \r\nregion. We are the most dynamic economy in Latin America. Our country has \r\ngrown at a sustained rate of nearly 4 per cent per year for the last three \r\ndecades. Our management of the economy has been prudent and thoughtful, and \r\nhas kept us clear of the problems associated with indebtedness, \r\nhyperinflation, stagnation and unemployment. \r\nWhen someone comes to my country and meets my people, and does not \r\nencounter all the horrors that have sometimes been painted in the press, he \r\nbecomes our compatriot, and he learns that to be Colombian is a form of pride, \r\nof hidden tenacity and sharp wit. He also knows that you do not have to be \r\nborn in our country to be a Colombian for ever. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe President of the Republic of Colombia for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Cesar Gaviria Trujillo. President of Colombia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n16 \r\nADDRESS BY MR. ALIJA IZETBEGOVIC, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF BOSNIA AND \r\nHERZEGOVINA \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. \r\nMr. Alija Izetbegovic. President of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, His Excellency Mr. Alija Izetbegovic, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\nPresident IZETBEGOVIC: Let me begin by expressing my sincere \r\nappreciation to His Excellency Mr. Samir Shihabi for his wise administration \r\nand leadership of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. It is also \r\nmy great pleasure to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev on his \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh \r\nsession and to wish him a successful term. \r\nI also want you to know that we, the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nare deeply grateful to the United Nations for all of its efforts to achieve \r\npeace and for providing humanitarian assistance under very difficult \r\ncircumstances. The courageous troops of the United Nations Protection Force \r\n(UNPROFOR), with the tenacious leadership of Secretary-General, \r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, deserve special recognition and gratitude. \r\nAs is well known, I come from a country besieged by barbaric aggression. \r\nBut, I must emphasize, I have come here today not to talk of war but to \r\noffer peace. \r\nIt is an offer of a nation born of ethnic coexistence rather than ethnic \r\ncleansing. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n17 \r\n(President Izetbegovic) \r\nIt is an offer of a multicultural and multireligious Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina in which democracy and tolerance prevail. \r\nIt is not an offer of a unitary or ideological State, as some will have \r\nyou helieve. \r\nSome have said that the killing and destruction have caused so much \r\nhatred that my country\u0027s peoples cannot live together in peace any more. \r\nI submit to you that my country has a centuries-old tradition of \r\ntolerance and coexistence among its peoples. \r\nJust one week ago yesterday I celebrated, together with Muslims, Croats \r\nand other groups, the five-hundredth anniversary of the first settlement of \r\nJews in Bosnia and Herzegovina. \r\nBecause Muslims, Croats, Serbs, Jews and others have lived together in \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina for centuries, virtually all of our towns and cities \r\nare mixed in population some more, some less. \r\nIt is therefore not possible to draw lines through our Republic to \r\ndesignate ethnically pure regions. It is not possible to draw lines through \r\nour towns and cities to designate ethnically pure streets or neighborhoods. \r\nI submit to you that we, the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, can live \r\ntogether, and that we must live together, despite what has happened, provided \r\nthat equality, justice and freedom are secured for all. \r\nIn recent years, people of many nations have chosen democracy as the best \r\nmeans to secure their rights, to ensure religious and political liberty, to \r\npromote cooperation and mutual advancement, to enjoy the fruits of their \r\nlabours and to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number. \r\nTheir efforts have changed the world: they have opened doors where once \r\nthere was an iron curtain. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n18-20 \r\n(President Izetbegovic) \r\nThis guest for democracy has made an old world order crumble and a new \r\none begin. \r\nSo, too, have we, the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, turned to \r\ndemocratic government as the means to assure mutual welfare, regardless of \r\nethnic, religious or other distinctions. \r\nConsequently we have sought to build a government that represents all of \r\nthe people of Bosnia and Herzegovina equally and justly. \r\nI am proposing a constitutional commission for Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\nwhich includes inter-ethnic and inter-religious representation. The \r\ncommission will work with a group of international experts to develop a \r\nconstitutional settlement to the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina which will \r\nprotect the rights of all citizens. We envision it as encompassing the \r\nfollowing: \r\nFirst, a State founded on the principles of democracy, individual rights, \r\ntolerance, religious and cultural freedoms and a market economy; \r\nSecondly, a constitutional and administrative framework similar to that \r\nof modern democratic States; \r\nThirdly, a decentralized State organized on the principles of \r\nparliamentary civil democracy; and \r\nFourthly, a single legislative, executive and judicial framework for the \r\nwhole territory of the Republic, with decentralized administration in all \r\nregions. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n21 \r\n(President Izetbegovic) \r\nWe envision the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as consisting of \r\nadministrative territorial regions to be formed according to economic, \r\ncultural, historical and ethnic criteria. \r\nWe believe it is impractical and immoral to institute administrative \r\nterritorial regions on an exclusively ethnic basis. Moreover, it is \r\nimpossible, because we are an ethnically mixed, intermingled country: a \r\nliving, breathing Jackson Pollack painting. \r\nGovernment at every level will respect the equal rights of all the \r\npeoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Government will be based on the \r\nprinciple of parity of representation among the three constituent nations. \r\nThe legislative branch the Assembly will consist of two chambers: the \r\nChamber of Peoples will be based on ethnic parity, being made up of \r\nrepresentatives of the three largest constituent peoples of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina; the Chamber of Citizens will be based on proportional \r\nrepresentation. All representatives will be elected in free and open \r\nelections. \r\nThe Chamber of Peoples and the Presidency will reach key decisions by \r\nconsensus, including all decisions that directly affect the equality of the \r\nconstituent nations. \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina will seek to establish good relations with all \r\nneighbouring States, as well as with other States, on the basis of mutual \r\nrespect and cooperation. \r\nI have related my offer of peace. I now want to tell the Assembly about \r\nthe offer made by the Government in Belgrade and its proxies in Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina. By their actions and by their statements, they have made an \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n22 \r\n(President Izetbegovic) \r\noffer that must be clear to all nations of the world. Their offer is based on \r\nan entirely different view of Bosnia and Herzegovina: a view that is alien to \r\ndemocracy, but unfortunately familiar in history. It is a view of people \r\ndivided, hostile and unequal. \r\nFirst, they offer \"ethnic cleansing\", which is the extermination or \r\nelimination of people on the basis of ethnic, national or religious \r\ndistinctions. \r\nSecondly, they offer a brutal division of the Republic along spurious \r\nethnic boundaries created by force and by war. They say that the people \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina cannot live together in one State. But the only \r\nevidence they have is the false evidence they have manufactured by their own \r\naggression. \r\nAround the world we see diverse peoples living together. How many \r\nnations represented here have ethnic purity? Look west from this building and \r\nimagine Belgrade\u0027s vision applied, for example, to the United States. Imagine \r\nBerlin Walls sprouting in every American neighbourhood, separating the French, \r\nRussian, African-American, Italian, Jewish, Spanish, Japanese, Polish, Korean, \r\nIrish and other groups until all had been moved to ethnically pure \r\nneighbourhoods and separated by barbed wire, armed guards and checkpoints. \r\nFinally, they offer an expanding Serbia. We know that this will be a \r\nSerbia in which those who are not Serbs are denied fundamental freedoms. \r\nTheir offer leads to endless insecurity, endless conflict, endless suffering. \r\nThe question, then, is which offer the world will accept today. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n23 \r\n(President Izetbegovic) \r\nIf it accepts our offer of peace, equality and justice, and if it rejects \r\nthe offer of pain and division made by Belgrade and its proxies in Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, then I ask the world community to do three things. \r\nFirst, in front of the entire General Assembly, I ask the members of the \r\nSecurity Council to implement and enforce fully the existing Security Council \r\nresolutions and the principles and commitments endorsed at the London \r\nConference. \r\nWhile we have abided by the confidence- and security-building and \r\nverification agreement of the London Conference, the aggressors have not. \r\nContrary to their commitments, the aggressors have: failed to place all \r\nmortars and heavy weapons under international supervision; failed to cease \r\nmilitary air attacks; failed to close concentration camps; failed to allow \r\nrefugees to return to their homes; failed to allow delivery of relief \r\nsupplies; and failed to end \"ethnic cleansing\". \r\nThis record of broken promises shows that implementation and enforcement \r\nmust become the next step towards peace. It shows, for example, that a no-fly \r\nzone over Bosnia and Herzegovina is essential for stopping the massive \r\ndestruction from air attacks. A no-fly zone should be implemented and \r\nenforced immediately. Implementation and enforcement are absolutely essential \r\nif the Geneva session of the London Conference is to have any chance of \r\nsuccess. \r\nSecondly, I ask the Assembly to set in motion an international war-crimes \r\ntribunal that would work closely with the Geneva Conference. It is essential \r\nthat we investigate, prosecute and punish those who have been responsible for \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n24 \r\n(President Izetbegovic) \r\nwar crimes. Only after the criminals are punished and the victims healed will \r\nwe have a true peace. Exonerate the innocent and bring a reconciliation of \r\nour people. \r\nThirdly, our country has been plundered and razed. Its economic base has \r\nbeen destroyed. I would like to take this opportunity to request the \r\nestablishment of an international fund for the reconstruction and development \r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina. Considering the massive scale of the destruction, \r\nit is necessary that the world community help us take the first step in \r\nemerging from the ruins. \r\nFinally, if the Security Council cannot implement and enforce fully its \r\nresolutions and if the London Conference cannot implement its principles and \r\nagreements, then I ask the world community to allow us to defend ourselves. \r\nI have offered a vision of a secular and democratic State, a \r\ndecentralized State and a multi-ethnic society based on peaceful coexistence \r\nand tolerance. Unfortunately, the offer of peace which I have proposed will \r\nbecome irrelevant unless this Organization comes resolutely to our defence or, \r\nalternatively, fully enables us to exercise our right to self-defence. The \r\ninternational community cannot simultaneously sidestep its commitment to \r\ndefend us and nullify our means of self-defence. It has become clear that no \r\none has come resolutely to our aid. We must have the unhindered right of \r\nself-defence. \r\nArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter grants us that absolute right. \r\nThe present arms embargo ties our hands at a time when our country is being \r\nstrangled. It deprives us of the only effective means of self-defence. By \r\ndoing so, it helps the aggressor. \r\nThe arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina must be voided. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n25 \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe President of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\nMr. Aliia Izetbegovic. President of the Republic of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.* \r\nMr. Rogers (Belize), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n26 \r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued) \r\nGENERAL DEBATE \r\nMrs, de ST. JORRE (Seychelles) (interpretation from French): We \r\nshould first like to congratulate Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at this session. \r\nBarely a year ago, the representatives of the United Nations, meeting in \r\nthis same Hall, ventured to believe that a new era of peace, cooperation and \r\nunderstanding was being established. We glimpsed on the horizon a new order \r\nin which each would be recognized, in which all nations, large and small, \r\nwould have equal responsibilities and obligations in mutual respect. \r\nWe believed that. We really believed that, because the mood was one of \r\noptimism. After all, the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait had marked \r\nthe triumph of legitimacy. Then, bloc confrontation being over, it was time \r\nfor dialogue, since ideological antagonism had been overcome. \r\nToday, the world is again experiencing upheavals and disruption. We are \r\nseeing States imploding. Peoples are plagued by hunger, destitution and \r\npoverty. We are powerless witnesses to this grim spectacle, whereas we should \r\nbe the artisans of change. \r\nWho can deny the seriousness of all this? Noble ideas, lofty sentiments \r\nand good intentions are not enough for the well-being of humankind. Perhaps I \r\nshould add: \"are no longer enough\". \r\nThis is an obvious fact and should provide a basic tenet for our work. \r\nWe must all show our interest in it, so that our destiny might express our \r\ndetermination. The world is changing, and in order to control these changes, \r\nwe are building the new order. This is a voluntary endeavour, based on the \r\nrespect of nations, on partnership, on interdependence. But who would deny \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n27 \r\n(Mrs, de St. Jorre. Seychelles) \r\nthat the new world order has something of a colossus with feet of clay? On \r\nwhat kind of world will this system be modelled? \r\nMore than 4 billion human beings live in poor countries. Whereas the \r\nrich nations, with about 15 per cent of the world\u0027s population, control more \r\nthan 80 per cent of the world\u0027s income, about 60 per cent of humankind live in \r\nlow-income countries, and more than 3 billion people possess only 5 per cent \r\nof the total income. With a population of more than 450 million, sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica has less than 1 per cent of the world\u0027s income. \r\nCan we accept the exclusion of these millions of human beings? It is as \r\nif history had speeded up, had shaken up our ways of thinking, leaving our \r\nminds all confused. It is as if fragility had become the watchword of human \r\nadventure. \r\nNo! At a time when we are all committed to building this new world \r\norder, stronger solidarity is needed more than ever, because poverty is not \r\ninevitable, nor is it a genetic defect. \r\nThe challenge is daunting. Short-term, stopgap solutions are not \r\nenough. We simply must radically change the attitude\u0027and behaviour of the \r\nindustrialized world to the chronic plight of many countries in the South. In \r\norder to do this, there can be no double standards, tacit tolerance for some \r\nand vague promises for others. Have we the right today to denounce the \r\ncorruption, abuse and lapses that are widespread in many developing countries, \r\nconsidering that these same practices were not so long ago tolerated and even \r\nencouraged by some? Can we welcome the changes that have occurred and I am \r\nreferring to the democratization of institutions even though in many cases \r\nthey are accompanied by chaos and suffering? \r\nNevertheless, we must not underestimate the contribution that the \r\ninternational community is entitled to expect from each country, considered as \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n28-30 \r\n(Mrs, de St. Jorre. Seychelles) \r\nit is to be an artisan of its own development. Each must, in particular, \r\nestablish institutions and procedures compatible with the rights and \r\nobligations that all must now shoulder, regardless of level of development. \r\nBut what are we to think, what are we to say about the increasing \r\ntensions between the industrialized North, certain that it is in the right, \r\nand the South, which gets poorer all the time, plagued by contradiction and \r\nseeking, sometimes clumsily, fresh sources of relief? \r\nHow sincere is the wealth of advice given in the options suggested, the \r\nguidelines prescribed? Are we not in a diktat situation when we hear the \r\nfollowing: \"Adopt reforms, democratize your institutions, go ahead and \r\nliberalize your economies. Then, and only then, will we help you.\" \r\nWhat developing country seeking an evolutive process has not been on the \r\nreceiving end of this kind of message? How few, without adapting, have \r\nmanaged to adopt new, realistic and productive policies? \r\nThere is no single model exportable to all. There is no absolute model \r\nthat works for everyone. It is in the name of principles and experiments, all \r\ntoo often garbled within the framework of open-economy programmes and \r\ndemocratization, that crushing failures have occurred. Has the debt burden \r\nbeen eased? Have commodity export earnings in the third world increased? \r\nClearly, one figure speaks for all the others: that of the aid given by \r\nrich countries to the poorer ones. Logically, it shows the importance \r\nattached by the donors to the development projects they are supposed to \r\nsupport. But the figures are rarely commensurate with their lofty ambitions; \r\nthat we must admit. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n31 \r\n(Mrs, de St. Jorre. Seychelles) \r\nCan it be expected by any chance of the smaller countries in \r\nparticular that they should use other means to generate the resources \r\nnecessary for their own development? This would be to ignore the economic \r\nfact of interaction and interdependence, which are difficult to manage and \r\ncannot really be the sole responsibility of these small countries. \r\nIn seeking financial assistance, expertise and transfers of technology, \r\nwe are trying first to encourage international solidarity, without excluding \r\nanyone and within as broad a context as possible. Was not that the great \r\nlesson of Rio, despite the flaws and imperfections of political dialogue, in \r\nthat it reminded those who had been tempted to forget that everthing is global \r\nnowadays for better or for worse, as in marriage where reason prevails \r\nover emotion? \r\nHowever, despite the urgent need for proper solutions, four months after \r\nthe Rio Conference we are once again deploring the inertia of political \r\ndialogue, the complaisance of declarations of intent and the lack of \r\nperseverance in following up decisions. \r\nThe right to make a mistake is not enshrined in any constitution, and yet \r\nare not famine, war and environmental disasters to name just three of the \r\nworst scourges monumental mistakes? Silence denotes guilt. We must not \r\nquibble or condemn here. We must agree on what we can do - together.* \r\nADDRESS BY MRS. GRO HARLEM BRUNDTLAND, PRIME MINISTER OF THE KINGDOM OF \r\nNORWAY \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Norway. \r\nMrs. Gro Harlem Brundtland. Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Norway, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\nThe President returned to the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n32 \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I have great pleasure in welcoming the Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Norway, Mrs. Gro Harlem Brundtland, and inviting \r\nher to address the General Assembly. \r\nMrs. BRUNDTLAND (Norway): It is a great pleasure for me to \r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to your high office at such an \r\nimportant juncture in the history of the United Nations. I should also like \r\nto greet the many new Members that have been admitted to our Organization in \r\nrecent months. We welcome them all and look forward to cooperating closely \r\nwith them in our efforts to strengthen the United Nations. \r\nMany of us had hoped to see a new, more equitable world order emerge in \r\nthe wake of the profound changes we have experienced over recent years. \r\nUnfortunately, this has not been the case. The tragic conflicts in Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina and Somalia illustrate the challenges we are up against. In many \r\nways they are similar. Underlying ethnic, religious, social and economic \r\nproblems were \"frozen\" during the cold war. They were suppressed rather than \r\ndealt with in a constructive way. Democratic traditions were not allowed to \r\ndevelop. Some leaders have exploited the absence of democratic traditions, \r\nappealing to narrow ethnic and even clan interests. The disastrous \r\nconsequences are brought home to us daily on our television screens. In \r\nSomalia the political crisis has been deepened by extreme poverty and by \r\nenvironmental degradation. \r\nWe must strongly condemn the unspeakable cruelties being committed in \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and other parts of the former Yugoslavia. We cannot \r\naccept, and will not recognize, any attempts to change international borders \r\nby force. The parties must understand that they cannot achieve their goals by \r\narmed force. I urge the parties to the conflict to cease fighting at once. \r\nThe \"ethnic cleansing\" in the former Yugoslavia is an unacceptable violation of \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n33 \r\n(Mrs. Brundtland. Norway) \r\ninternational law and must be brought to a halt. An international tribunal \r\nshould be set up to punish all those responsible for the war crimes that are \r\nnow being committed. All prison and detention camps should be closed down \r\nimmediately, and the captives must be allowed to return freely to their homes \r\nwithout any further harassment. \r\nStrict observance of the sanctions introduced by the United Nations \r\nSecurity Council is essential to exert maximum pressure on the parties \r\nconcerned. As the former Yugoslavia no longer exists, Serbia and Montenegro \r\nmust apply for membership of the United Nations, along with other new States. \r\nWe must all give our firm and uneguivocal support to the London Agreement and \r\nthe Geneva process. All parties to the conflict must now honour their \r\ncommitments. The United Nations Protection Force, in which we are proud to \r\ntake part, is doing a tremendous job under exceedingly difficult \r\ncircumstances, particularly in Bosnia. We must all stand united behind the \r\nUnited Nations and refrain from actions that will only prolong the conflict. \r\nOur first priority must be to alleviate the sufferings of the civilian \r\npopulation by providing humanitarian assistance. A great number of human \r\nlives will depend upon how the United Nations manages to protect humanitarian \r\nsupplies and monitor heavy weaponry. I strongly condemn the cowardly attacks \r\non United Nations forces engaged in humanitarian supply operations around \r\nSarajevo. Those guilty of these crimes must be found and brought to trial. \r\nIt is now of the utmost importance to prevent the conflict in Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina from spreading throughout the Balkan area. We must consider all \r\navailable means, and support those measures which have already been applied. \r\nThe recent decision by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to \r\nsend observer teams to Kosovo, Sandzak and Vojvodina is an important step. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n34-35 \r\n(Mrs. Brundtland. Norway) \r\nWhile we are grieved by the tragic war, we must not lose hope. We must \r\nassist the people of the former Yugoslavia to accept and respect each other \r\nand to come to terms again, making peace through reconciliation. We must \r\nencourage the forces of moderation and good will; we must ensure that all \r\nparties take part in a peace-making process. We must act justly - and, if \r\nneed be, forcefully. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n36 \r\n(Mrs. Brundtland. Norway) \r\nIn Somalia the United Nations must give top priority to providing \r\nsufficient food and medical supplies to the starving people. This will be an \r\nimportant test of our collective ability to respond quickly and effectively in \r\nthe face of natural and man-made disasters. Somalia also needs assistance in \r\nfinding political solutions to its internal problems, and, equally \r\nimportantly, in building a more sustainable economy. Norway supports a United \r\nNations peace-keeping presence in this war-torn country, and we are willing to \r\nparticipate in such an operation. \r\nThe time for peaceful change in South Africa is running out. We condemn \r\nthe recent killings of innocent people, and call on the South African \r\nGovernment to restrain the police and the army throughout South Africa, \r\nincluding the so-called homelands. We are confident that this can be \r\nachieved, if it really wants to. \r\nWe urge the South African Government to meet the reasonable demands of \r\nthe African National Congress of South Africa so that negotiations can be \r\nresumed in order to work out the framework for adopting a new constitution and \r\nestablishing an interim government. Norway is prepared to contribute at a \r\npractical level by sending observers to monitor the violence and facilitate \r\nthe negotiation process in South Africa. We will maintain our economic \r\nboycott until we see some real progress in the negotiations. \r\nAll these crises and conflicts demonstrate the need for more effective \r\ninternational crisis-prevention and crisis-management mechanisms. The end of \r\nthe cold war has opened a window of opportunity for the United Nations to live \r\nup to the great objectives of its Charter. We must seize that opportunity. \r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s report \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277) is a \r\nstarting-point for a serious discussion on how this can be achieved. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n37 \r\n(Mrs. Brundtland. Norway) \r\nWe need to consider further the circumstances under which the United \r\nNations should resort to real enforcement, mindful of our obligations under \r\nthe Charter. Burden-sharing is essential with regard to peace-keeping. Every \r\ncountry has a duty to participate, including those which so far, for various \r\nreasons, have refrained from getting involved. \r\nSome 35,000 Norwegian men and women have participated in a total of \r\n16 United Nations peace-keeping operations. We are prepared to intensify our \r\nefforts in this field. But our collective efforts must move beyond \r\ntraditional peace-keeping into such fields as refugee-repatriation, electoral \r\nassistance and human rights monitoring. This concept proved successful in \r\nNamibia and is now being put to a new test in Cambodia. As a means of \r\nimproving our capacity for such broader operations, we have proposed the \r\nestablishment of a special United Nations institute for education and training \r\nin peace-keeping and related activites. \r\nThere can be no lasting peace in the world as long as a large part of \r\nhumanity lives in misery and despair. Maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity is a prime responsibility of the United Nations, as is promoting \r\neconomic and social progress and respect for human rights. \r\nWe must adamantly oppose any tendency to ignore the fundamental \r\nchallenges of the continuing North-South divide. Otherwise the very future of \r\nour planet is in danger. \r\nIn spite of remarkable economic and social progress in many developing \r\ncountries, the inequalities persist. According to the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme\u0027s latest human development report, the richest \r\n20 per cent of the world\u0027s population receive 83 per cent of total world \r\nincome, whereas the poorest 20 per cent have only 1.4 per cent. We cannot \r\nallow these inequalities to persist. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n38 \r\n(Mrs. Brundtland. Norway) \r\nThe African continent has been particularly hard hit by economic decline, \r\nand a concerted international effort must be mounted to reverse this \r\nunfortunate situation. \r\nTo break out of the development impasse, increased contributions from the \r\nindustrialized countries will be needed, in the form of better market access \r\nfor developing countries, more investment, increased development aid and debt \r\nrelief for the poorest countries. \r\nBut the slow rate of economic growth and high level of unemployment in \r\nmost countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development \r\nlimit demands for products from developing countries. The outlook is \r\nuncertain, and the unfinished business of the Uruguay Round adds to this \r\nuncertainty. Capital needs are enormous; competition for capital is fierce. \r\nDeveloping countries are the losers. \r\nThe current financial and monetary instability poses great risks to \r\ncountries and individuals. We need to impose stability and prevent \r\nspeculation from throwing national economies into peril. There is no \r\nalternative to effective coordination of financial and monetary policies. But \r\nthat coordination can succeed only when coupled with social purpose, a fair \r\ndistribution and public efforts to create employment. In fact, most of the \r\neconomic problems that we are faced with are linked to lack of coordination, \r\nto rivalry and to laissez-faire attitudes among industrialized countries. \r\nThe developing countries are, as always, the ultimate losers. Their best \r\nline of defence is to undertake policy reforms to mobilize their people, \r\neducate them and and diversify their economies. Development is not likely to \r\naccelerate without good governance, democracy, respect for human rights, \r\nreduced military spending and improved redistribution systems, with increased \r\nemphasis on health and education. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n39-40 \r\n(Mrs. Brundtland. Norway) \r\nAlleviating world poverty is necessary if we are to reduce the rapid \r\npopulation increase in many parts of the world. At present rates, the world \r\npopulation is doubling every 40 years, and could reach somewhere between \r\n8 billion and 14 billion by the middle of the next century. Keeping to the \r\nlow end of that scale will make all the difference to life on Earth and \r\nhumanity. \r\nWe must deal with population growth through an integrated human rights \r\napproach, including education and the enhancement of the status of women, \r\nimproved public health and family planning. \r\nConfronted with these great challenges, we find it a sad paradox that \r\ndevelopment aid flows continue to stagnate and remain at less than half of the \r\nUnited Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). \r\nNorway\u0027s official development aid has exceeded 1 per cent of our GDP for more \r\nthan 10 years, which reflects our strong commitment to the fight against \r\npoverty. \r\nAt the Rio Conference on Environment and Development it was made clear \r\nthat we are heading towards a crisis of uncontrollable dimensions unless we \r\nchange course. The North as well as the rich in the South will have to change \r\nconsumption and production patterns. \r\nDeveloping nations came to the Rio Summit with open economic demands, and \r\nunderstandably so: for them, the Conference was essentially about development \r\nand justice. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n41 \r\n(Mrs. Brundtland. Norway) \r\nAt Rio, we achieved progress in many fields, but too little in most \r\nfields and none at all in some fields. We opened two important conventions \r\nfor signature. It is imperative that we make them more effective. They will \r\nnot work unless all major countries sign, ratify and implement them. \r\nFurthermore, Rio made it clear that the challenges of dealing with \r\nenvironmental threats and poverty are cross-cutting, long term, predictable \r\nand unavoidable unless we establish a world order of burden-sharing, common \r\nperceptions and common responsibility. \r\nTherefore, critical decisions remain to be taken. Traditional \r\ninternational conferences run by consensus can advance only at the pace of the \r\nmost reluctant mover in each field. The future requires stronger \r\ndecision-making procedures. Nothing less will serve us. I welcome the \r\nhigh-level Commission on Sustainable Development and expect it to become \r\neffective under a revitalization of the economic and social responsibilities \r\nof the United Nations. Norway proposed the establishment of such a Commission \r\nand expects to take an active part in its work. \r\nThe challenge of economic and social development requires a more unified \r\napproach and stronger direction within the United Nations system. Over the \r\nyears the number of agencies, programmes and councils has mushroomed, with too \r\nlittle inter-agency cooperation. This cannot continue. We must streamline \r\nour organization to avoid duplication and to improve effectiveness. \r\nThe Nordic countries have addressed these challenges through the Nordic \r\nUnited Nations Project. Although we have made some headway, we need to \r\nproceed during the present session of the General Assembly. \r\nIn view of the greater demands now being made on the United Nations, we \r\nmust stress the importance of sound and predictable financing. Being the \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n42 \r\n(Mrs. Brundtland. Norway) \r\neighth largest contributor to the United Nations system in absolute terms, and \r\nby far the largest in per capita terms, we find it exceedingly difficult to \r\nunderstand why so many countries fail to honour their obligations. \r\nIt is disappointing, to say the least, to read in the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\nreport: \r\n\"Perennial shortages, the absence of reserves, and a debilitating \r\nuncertainty over the immediate future, are the main characteristics of \r\nthe financial situation of the United Nations.\" (A/47/1, para. 46) \r\nImmediately preceding this sentence the Secretary-General points out that some \r\n$900 million in assessed contributions are unpaid, together with some \r\n$844 million dollars towards peace-keeping operations. \r\nFrankly, this is an unworthy situation. We must increase our financial \r\ndiscipline. The permanent members of the Security Council have a special \r\nresponsibility in this respect. And the question must be raised whether \r\ncountries should be eligible at all for membership of the Security Council if \r\nthey have not paid their dues.* \r\nWe must be willing to provide the Secretary-General and his staff with \r\nthe necessary means to promote peace and to wage war against environmental \r\ndegradation and underdevelopment. \r\nOur daily diet of printed and electronic nens presents a picture of a \r\nworld in need of better governance and of more coordination. Our present \r\nforms of cooperation, developed in a less interdependent world, are still too \r\nweak and unlikely to stand the test of time. We should not pretend that they \r\ncan. \r\n* Mr. Rogers (Belize), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n43 \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Norway for the statement she has just \r\nmade. \r\nMrs. Gro Harlem Brundtland. Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Norway, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\nMr. VELAYATI (Islamic Republic of Iran) (spoke in Persian; English \r\ntext furnished by the delegation): At the outset, I should like to offer the \r\nPresident my most sincere congratulations on his well-deserved election to \r\npreside over the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly and to express \r\nmy delegation\u0027s gratitude and appreciation for the constructive efforts of the \r\nPresident of the forty-sixth session. It is our earnest hope that the General \r\nAssembly, drawing upon our President\u0027s valuable experience and diplomatic \r\nskills, will play a significant role in the new international environment. I \r\nassure him of my delegation\u0027s full cooperation to this end. \r\nI also take this opportunity to offer my heartfelt felicitations to the \r\nnew Members who have joined us in the United Nations since the last session of \r\nthe General Assembly, most of whom are neighbours of the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran. It is a matter of great joy and satisfaction for me and my delegation \r\nthat the seat of Afghanistan in the Assembly is at long last occupied by the \r\nrepresentatives of the legitimate Government of that country. \r\nThis session opens at a time, in the aftermath of the cold war, when \r\ntumultuous developments in the international arena continue to unfold, facing \r\nthe international community with opportunities and challenges alike. In the \r\ncold-war era the global arms race, the arming of client States and the \r\ninstigation of regional wars sapped the energy and capabilities of countries, \r\nespecially in the third world, thus debilitating them in their efforts to \r\nstand up to the challenge of such chronic and endemic problems as poverty. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n44-45 \r\n(Mr. Velayati. Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\nhunger, illiteracy, drug-addiction and drug trafficking, underdevelopment and \r\nenvironmental pollution. \r\nThe collapse of the bipolar world has created a propitious opportunity \r\nfor mankind to address those problems in earnest. It has also brought to the \r\nfore new threats to international peace and security, such as the devising of \r\nnew ways of expansion and consolidation of domination and hegemony, a further \r\nwidening of the North-South gap and flare-ups of ethnic and racial differences \r\nand conflicts. \r\nDue to continuing transformations in geographical, economic, military and \r\ncultural configurations, the world today is in a vulnerable state of flux, and \r\nuntil reliable stability emerges the approach of big Powers to the United \r\nNations and that of the Organization to international issues and problems will \r\nremain very sensitive and significant. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n46 \r\n(Mr. Velayati. Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\nThe United Nations, as the only universal body, should contribute to the \r\nsolution of major global problems without resort to short-sighted political \r\nexpediency. It should do so on the basis of justice and respect for human \r\ndignity, lofty human values and the rules of international law. Selectivity \r\nis certain to turn the Organization into a tool for legitimizing the actions \r\nof powerful Member States. This represents the most formidable challenge to \r\nthe Organization\u0027s integrity, credibility and relevance. \r\nIn this context I need give just a few clear examples: first, in dealing \r\nwith internationsl crises, the use of double standards based on the political \r\ninterests of the powerful, as manifested, on one hand, by the Security \r\nCouncil\u0027s treatment of Iraq\u0027s aggression against Kuwait and, on the other \r\nhand, by the decades-old aggression of the Zionist regime; secondly, the \r\nnon-application, for reasons of political expediency, of the existing means \r\nand instruments to certain crises, as witnessed in the Council\u0027s half-hearted \r\napproach to Serbia\u0027s blatant aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina; thirdly, indifference to, or total negligence of, certain \r\nexplosive and tragic situations, such as those in Somalia and Liberia, which, \r\ndespite obvious disruptive regional ramifications, do not seem to have a \r\ndirect bearing on the interests of outside Powers; fourthly, the manipulation \r\nof cherished human ideals in the field of human rights for short-sighted, \r\nulterior political motives. \r\nUndoubtedly, a fair, objective and non-selective approach by the United \r\nNations to internationsl issues and crises will help to ensure that the \r\nOrganization can play an effective role in the future and, away from the \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Velayati. Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\npeddling of big-Power influence, put it in the unique position of being able \r\nto act as the centre for concerted international cooperation. \r\nAt this point I must express to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali our \r\nappreciation for his efforts to make the Organization more efficient and to \r\nenhance its role in the resolution of chronic and new international problems. \r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has studied with care and keen interest the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s report of 17 June 1992, entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\". \r\nIt is our considered view that the report deals with a wide range of \r\ntheoretical and practical issues issues that are very sensitive and merit \r\nthe General Assembly\u0027s careful and in-depth scrutiny. \r\nIt is incumbent on the General Assembly, as the only universal organ of \r\nthe United Nations, to formulate and adopt the Organization\u0027s future work. \r\nSuch an endeavour, within the framework of the Charter and based on full \r\nrespect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence \r\nof Member States and on non-interference in their internal affairs, will \r\ncertainly contribute to refinement of the concepts and suggestions embodied in \r\nthe Secretary-General\u0027s report, and this will help him to discharge his \r\nduties. My delegation is willing to participate actively in a special working \r\ngroup of the General Assembly on this matter. \r\nAmong the most sensitive issues dealt with in the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\nreport is the active role of the Security Council in the new international \r\nenvironment. The Security Council, in accordance with the United Nations \r\nCharter, bears primary responsibility for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, but, in the discharge of its responsibilities, the Council \r\ndoes not have unfounded authority. By definition, it must fine-tune its \r\ndecisions and actions with the principles and objectives of the Charter and of \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n48 \r\n(Mr. Velayati. Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\ninternational law. Discriminatory treatment of issues pertaining to \r\ninternational peace and security, the overstepping of mandated authority and \r\nmisuse of the privileges accorded to the members of the Council the \r\npermanent members in particular are among the practices that tarnish the \r\nCouncil\u0027s image and undermine its stature and credibility and, in the final \r\nanalysis, that of the United Nations. A thorough and vigorous study and \r\nformulation of well-defined guidelines will help the Council to adopt an \r\nobjective and non-discriminationary approach, within a specific framework and \r\nspecific terms of reference, to various issues of international peace and \r\nsecurity. I must emphasize that the preservation of international peace and \r\nsecurity is a responsibility entrusted to the Security Council by the \r\ninternational community. That being the case, the Council, in accordance with \r\nthe Charter, is accountable to that community, which is represented by the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\nThe existing international exigencies make especially necessary the \r\nstrengthening of global efforts to facilitate the overall process of \r\ndisarmament and arms control - in particular, the elimination of weapons of \r\nmass destruction. To this end, reappraisal of the military doctrines of the \r\nbig Powers in consonance with the new international situation, a change in \r\nattitudes of domination, and rejection of resort to force as a means of \r\npromoting political objectives constitute the primary prereguisite for the \r\nsuccess of all disarmament and arms-control schemes. \r\nThe preparation of a draft convention on the prohibition of the \r\nproduction, development, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons represents a \r\nsignificant step in the history of arms control. Undoubtedly, this convention \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n49 \r\n(Mr. Velayati. Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\ncrystallizes many years\u0027 difficult, even tedious, negotiations between the \r\nmembers of the Conference on Disarmament. Notwithstanding this obvious fact, \r\nthe convention - on the one hand, because the Conference on Disarmament acts \r\non the basis of consensus and, on the other, owing to the supremacy of \r\npolitical exigencies throughout the process, but especially during the latter \r\nstages - cannot be regarded as a document that reflects the principled views \r\nand positions of all members of the Conference on Disarmament. This is \r\nparticularly true in respect of the composition of the executive council, \r\nwhich, in our view, lacks balance and proportion. Furthermore, if the \r\nconvention on chemical weapons is to become universal the developed countries \r\nwill have to provide for the transfer of chemical technology, materials and \r\nequipment for peaceful purposes, and the existing unilateral discriminatory \r\nand ad hoc restrictions will have to be removed. \r\nIn the field of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the \r\nnon-proliferation Treaty can indeed acquire a universal character and play an \r\neffective and efficient role in preventing the vertical and horizontal \r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons, provided that the nuclear-weapon States \r\nfulfil their obligations in accordance with article VI of the Treaty. \r\nIt is highly desirable that the next millennium be nuclear-free, but the \r\nachievement of that objective depends upon the following: an undertaking by \r\nall nuclear-weapon States to destroy all nuclear weapons in their territory or \r\nunder their jurisdiction or control; a new pledge by all States not to acquire \r\nor proliferate nuclear weapons and not to add to their existing stocks; and a \r\ngenuine commitment to enhanced cooperation in technology for the peaceful use \r\nof nuclear energy. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n50 \r\n(Mr. Velayati. Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\nFurther regional endeavours in the field of arms control, regional \r\ndisarmament and the establishment of zones free of weapons of mass destruction \r\ncan complement international efforts towards the prohibition of such weapons \r\nand can contribute to the alleviation of the international community\u0027s concern \r\nabout the dangerous conseguences of stockpiling armaments at the regional \r\nlevel. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. Velayati. Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\nMy country, as the initiator of the proposal for the establishment of a \r\nnuclear-free zone in the Middle East, is fully prepared to participate \r\nactively in any constructive and comprehensive initiative in this field. It \r\ngoes without saying, though, that the success of initiatives concerning arms \r\ncontrol and regional disarmament depends on heeding a number of considerations \r\nsuch as the political and security characteristics of the regions in guestion, \r\nparticipation of the regional countries in defining the principles and \r\nobjectives of the initiative, the concerns of the countries in the region \r\nvis-a-vis threats from within and outside the region, including consequences \r\nof the presence of foreign forces. \r\nWhat seems more urgent and critical than regional disarmament is the \r\nnecessity and desirability of searching for a comprehensive and genuine \r\nsolution to regional conflicts, as an endemic and seemingly intractable source \r\nof threat to international peace and security. Over and above the chronic \r\nregional crises, recent developments at the international level have given \r\nbirth to a series of new crises in various regions, thus further accentuating \r\nthe need for a new sense of vigilance and vigorous endeavour on the part of \r\nthe international community to confront these threats. \r\nIn my brief survey of regional crises and conflicts, I cannot but begin \r\nwith what is closest to the hearts and minds of the Islamic world - that is, \r\nPalestine. The legitimate uprising of the Palestinian people in the occupied \r\nterritories, as a form of resistance against occupation, expansionism, murder \r\nand unbearable living conditions, is brutally suppressed. Alongside the \r\nregular armed forces, armed Zionist settlers carry out on a daily and \r\ncontinuing basis acts of murder and plunder, including confiscation of \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. Velayati. Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\nPalestinian property. In addition to Palestine, parts of Syrian and Lebanese \r\nterritory are still under Zionist occupation and innocent people are killed or \r\nabducted on a regular basis by these forces in South Lebanon. \r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran calls on the international community to \r\nconfront the aggressive and repressive policies of the Zionists in a serious \r\nand meaningful manner. The bitter experience of the past decades indicate, \r\nhowever, that peace and tranquillity can be restored to the area only through \r\nstruggle, full restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people \r\nand establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the entire territory \r\nof Palestine. \r\nAnother crisis which has endangered regional and global security over the \r\npast year concerns the tragic situation in the Republic of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina. The crimes perpetrated against the people in that young and \r\nsmall Republic have few parallels in the post-Second-World-War era. The \r\naggression against the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political \r\nindependence of a Member of the United Nations and the simultaneous torture, \r\nmass killings and policy of genocide and \"ethnic cleansing\", as pursued by \r\nSerbia and its ultra-nationalist Serb agents with the objective of forming \r\n\"greater Serbia\", have caused deep consternation throughout the world and \r\ndrawn condemnation from almost all quarters. Nevertheless, Serbia and its \r\nagents continue to show utter disdain for the international community\u0027s \r\ndecisions, as reflected in numerous Security Council resolutions and General \r\nAssembly resolution 46/242, continuing their crimes against the people of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, in particular the Muslim population, with a seeming \r\nsense of immunity and impunity. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Velayati. Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\nIt is therefore incumbent upon the Security Council to adopt the \r\nnecessary measures provided for in Article 42 of the Charter to put an end to \r\nthe aggression and to restore the sovereignty, territorial integrity, \r\npolitical independence and unity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. \r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran once again emphasizes the inherent right of the \r\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to self-defence in accordance with \r\nArticle 51 of the Charter and expects the Security Council to reconsider its \r\nresolution on an arms embargo against Yugoslavia in order to enable the \r\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to exercise its inherent right to resist \r\naggression. \r\nMoreover, I would like to emphasize that in the view of a large majority \r\nof the Member States, including the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Socialist \r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia no longer exists and the Federal Republic of \r\nYugoslavia - Serbia and Montenegro - has no right to occupy the seat of former \r\nYugoslavia in international forums. We strongly believe that the Assembly \r\nshould send a very clear and unambiguous signal to Belgrade, through the \r\nexpulsion of Serbia and Montenegro from all organs of the United Nations, that \r\nto be a Member of the Organization it will be subject to all the criteria for \r\nmembership and will have to behave accordingly. \r\nThere are two other continuing crises in the immediate neighborhood of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran to which my country cannot remain indifferent \r\nbecause of humanitarian as well as national security considerations. \r\nExpressing its satisfaction at the victory of the Muslim mujahidin of \r\nAfghanistan and the establishment of an Islamic State, the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran welcomes the cessation of fratricidal bloodshed in its fraternal \r\nneighbouring country. My country extends its support to the legitimate \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n54 \r\n(Mr. Velayati. Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan, stresses the imperative of non-interference of all \r\ncountries in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, and once again draws the \r\nattention of the international community to the pressing humanitarian needs of \r\nthe war-stricken Afghan people. For our part, we have made endeavours in this \r\ndirection and underline our readiness to cooperate with other countries as \r\nwell as international organizations in the provision of food, medicine and \r\nother essential needs as well as in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. \r\nIn regard to the Nogorno-Karabakh region, the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nfrom the very outset expressed its concern at the continuation and expansion \r\nof the conflict and exerted every effort to bring the fighting to an end; this \r\nresulted in the establishment of a cease-fire and commencement of negotiations \r\nbetween the Republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia. It is a matter of deep \r\nregret that owing to the reticence of the international community - and \r\nparticularly that of the Security Council the opportunity of propitious \r\nsituation which existed at that time and which could have been further \r\nsolidified through the dispatching of international observers was lost and \r\nbloodshed flared up and has continued. In our view, the Karabakh crisis can \r\nbe resolved only through negotiations and on the basis of mutual respect and \r\nnon-interference as well as the preservation of the sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of the two countries. \r\nThe approach of the Islamic Republic of Iran to these two crises and the \r\nefforts undertaken in regard to them emanate from our overall policy towards \r\nneighbouring countries, which is based on the promotion and consolidation of \r\ngood-neighbourly relations, expansion of economic, cultural and scientific \r\ncooperation, and fostering of regional confidence. For we believe that \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n55 \r\n(Mr. Velayati. Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\nsecurity in our region is attainable only through cooperation. As early as \r\n1986 the Islamic Republic of Iran, on the basis of this policy, underlined the \r\nimperative need for the creation of a regional security and cooperation \r\narrangement in the Persian Gulf area. In the General Assembly last year I \r\nenumerated the principles and objectives of such regional cooperation \r\nprinciples and objectives that continue to govern our approach to this \r\nstrategic region. The relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the \r\nnewly established Republics along our northern borders are based on the same \r\nprinciples, namely, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, \r\ninviolability of international borders, non-resort to force in the settlement \r\nof disputes, non-interference in internal affairs, and dialogue and mutual \r\nunderstanding. \r\nCognizant of the fact that the newly established republics of Central \r\nAsia and the Caucasus are now undergoing the difficult and tumultuous stage of \r\nstate-building, establishment and consolidation of democratic institutions and \r\neconomic stabilization and development, and with a view to the primacy of \r\npromotion of good-neighbourly relations and fostering of mutual confidence \r\nbetween the countries of this region, the Islamic Republic of Iran has taken \r\nthe lead in the sphere of expanding bilateral as well as multilateral ties \r\nwith these countries. We, along with our regional partners - Turkey and \r\nPakistan have welcomed the Republics of Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, \r\nTajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan into the Economic \r\nCooperation Organization (ECO). \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n56 \r\n(Mr. Velayati. Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\nWe also pioneered the formation of the Organization of the Countries of \r\nthe Caspian Sea Basin, along with the Russian Federation, Azerbaijan, \r\nTurkmenistan and Kazakhstan. \r\nIn the bilateral field, the foundations of political, cultural and \r\neconomic cooperation, particularly in the areas of transportation and energy, \r\nhave been laid with the newly established republics of the former USSR. That \r\napproach by the Islamic Republic of Iran is founded on the conviction that the \r\nexpansion of bilateral and multilateral relations among countries of the \r\nregion is bound to contribute to stability, security and development for all. \r\nIn today\u0027s world instability does not emanate solely from regional crises \r\nor military conflicts. Economic and environmental problems too threaten \r\ninternational peace and security. Continued further exacerbation of economic \r\ndifficulties in most third-world countries in the context, and as a result, of \r\nthe ever-widening gap between the North and the South is perhaps the most \r\nserious and most explosive danger threatening the international community. \r\nAs stated clearly in the World Economic Survey for 1992, world economic \r\noutput has decreased for the first time since the Second World War; \r\ninternational trade is also plagued with myriad difficulties. Under these \r\ndifficult circumstances, many developing countries are still grappling with \r\nthe problems resulting from the economic recession of the 1980s and its \r\nsocio-political conseguences. Worse still, a decreased flow of financial \r\nresources to developing countries has made the prospects for recovery and \r\neconomic growth and development in those countries all the more uncertain. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Velayati. Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\nNotwithstanding numerous problems, the recovery of the world economy is \r\nnot impossible to achieve. Its attainment, though, requires promotion of \r\ninternational cooperation and coordination of economic policies, which feature \r\namong the major purposes of the United Nations. To this end, the \r\nInternational Development Strategy for the fourth United Nations Development \r\nDecade, the Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at its eighteenth \r\nspecial session, and Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment \r\nand Development, which reflect long and intensive negotiations and represent \r\ninternational consensus on the objectives of development and environment, \r\nconstitute the necessary framework and basis of future measures. \r\nYet it is clear that in the absence of concerted international \r\ncooperation proper economic conditions where all countries enjoy egual \r\nopportunity for growth and development will remain unattainable. The United \r\nNations and its specialized agencies provide the most appropriate forum to \r\nfacilitate international cooperation with the objective of alleviating world \r\neconomic problems, especially those of the developing countries, thus \r\npreventing what otherwise seems an inevitable confrontation between North and \r\nSouth. \r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate the imperative of intensifying \r\nthe activities of the United Nations in step with international developments, \r\nwith a view to achieving a higher degree of efficiency and effectiveness. In \r\nthis context, the Islamic Republic of Iran is of the view that revitalization \r\nof the General Assembly should be pursued in earnest, and that effective \r\nmeasures to augment the efficiency, and thus the practical relevance, of the \r\nAssembly should be adopted. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr. Velayati. Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran) \r\nThe decision of the recent non-aligned summit to convene a high-level \r\nworking group to study ways and means of increasing the effectiveness of the \r\nUnited Nations represents a timely, logical and positive step, and can \r\ncertainly assist the United Nations in that purpose. The General Assembly, as \r\nthe sole universal, democratic and transparent organ of the United Nations, \r\nwith the competence entrusted to it by the Charter to address all \r\ninternational issues and problems, should fully exercise its Charter-mandated \r\nauthority in practice. To that end, the General Assembly should guide other \r\norgans of the United Nations on a constant and active basis, and take the \r\nnecessary decisions and make the appropriate recommendations for the \r\nrealization of common human ideals, most notably universal peace, security and \r\nrespect for human rights, and balanced prosperity and welfare. \r\nMr. VAYRYNEN (Finland): I wish to begin by congratulating my \r\ncolleague Mr. Stoyan Ganev on his election to the high office of President of \r\nthe General Assembly. He can rest assured that the delegation of Finland will \r\nrender him its full support in his challenging task. \r\nOn behalf of my Government I wish also to extend a warm welcome to the 13 \r\nnew Members amongst us. Their participation in the work of the United Nations \r\nwill further strengthen the Organization. \r\nSince the beginning of this year the United Nations has had a new \r\nSecretary-General. Faced with many difficult challenges, \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has already shown, in word and in deed, that he is \r\nfirmly in charge. We wish him all success in his work. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n59 \r\n(Mr. Vayrynen. Finland) \r\nThe United Nations Charter was drafted under dramatic circumstances \r\nduring the final stages of the Second World War. After two world wars, the \r\nUnited Nations was given the responsibility for maintaining peace and security \r\nfor future generations. Now, decades later, the Organization also faces a \r\nmultitude of other major challenges: those of development, protection of the \r\nenvironment and promotion of democracy and human rights. Courageous and \r\nvisionary leadership is now called for to create a new United Nations for a \r\nnew international era.* \r\nThe Security Council demonstrated such leadership at its historic summit \r\nmeeting held in January. After decades of cold war, the summit set new \r\npriorities for the United Nations in the promotion of peace and security \r\nworldwide, and provided guidelines for a more active United Nations \r\ninvolvement in the maintenance of peace. \r\nIn response to the initiative taken by the Security Council summit the \r\nSecretary-General has submitted an excellent report under the title \"An Agenda \r\nfor Peace\". In it he has innovatively addressed the question of how the full \r\npotential of the United Nations can be most effectively used in the service of \r\npeace and international security. The report is a comprehensive effort by the \r\nSecretary-General to relate preventive diplomacy, peace-making and \r\npeace-keeping, as well as peace-building, to the changing political and \r\nsecurity requirements of the world today. \r\nMs. Bongo (Gabon), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n60 \r\n(Mr. Vayrynen. Finland) \r\nI am especially pleased to note that the Secretary-General\u0027s thinking and \r\nmany of his recommendations are well in line with what Finland, often together \r\nwith the other Nordic countries, has itself long advocated. \r\nAs expressed so clearly in the Secretary-General\u0027s report, it is not \r\nsufficient that the United Nations should succeed in putting an end to \r\nconflicts. The best way to deal with conflicts is to prevent them. This is a \r\ncomplicated but vital task, where the capacity of the United Nations should be \r\nconsiderably strengthened. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n61 \r\n(Mr. Vavrynen. Finland) \r\nDifferent methods could come into question, depending on the specific \r\ncircumstances of each case. But the necessary basis for any prevention is \r\ncontinuous information-gathering and monitoring exercised both by the \r\nSecretary-General and by the Security Council. Early deployment of monitors \r\nor peace-keepers should be considered whenever necessary for effective \r\nprevention. \r\nMay I add that we are also grateful to the Secretary-General for the \r\ninnovative treatment of post-conflict, comprehensive peace-building in his \r\nreport. \r\nWhen the capacity of the United Nations to keep peace and prevent \r\nconflicts has been stretched to its limit, it is natural that other \r\nmeans should be taken under consideration. Here regional organizations and \r\nagencies can play a significant role. The Secretary-General\u0027s repeated calls \r\nfor closer cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and \r\nregional organizations are well-founded. \r\nAt its Helsinki Summit in July, the Conference on Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE) responded constructively. CSCE has strengthened \r\nits capacity for conflict management and peace-keeping. \r\nWe also support the Secretary-General\u0027s idea of periodic consultations \r\nbetween the United Nations and regional arrangements on confidence-building \r\nmeasures. \r\nThe tragic situation in former Yugoslavia shows clearly how a complex \r\nproblem requires an innovative approach. Under the joint leadership of the \r\nUnited Nations and the European Community, the Conference, with its six \r\nworking groups, is seeking solutions to the multitude of political, ethnic, \r\nhumanitarian and other problems in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. \r\nCSCE is also actively engaged in supporting the settlement of the conflict. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Vayrynen. Finland) \r\nIn this context, let me say that Finland supports the Security Council \r\nrecommendation to the General Assembly that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \r\nshould apply for membership in the United Nations and should not participate \r\nin the work of the General Assembly in the meantime. \r\nWhile regional organizations should play a greater role in dealing with \r\nthreats to security in their respective regions, the United Nations, through \r\nits Security Council, retains, of course, its unique and primary role and \r\nspecial instruments in maintaining international peace and security. \r\nThe Secretary-General reminds us of the most potent instrument available \r\nto the Security Council, Article 42 of the Charter. We agree with him that \r\nthe last-resort option of taking military action is essential to the \r\ncredibility of the United Nations as a guarantor of international security. \r\nWhile not underestimating the problems involved, we believe that the Security \r\nCouncil and all Members of the Organization should seriously consider the \r\nproposals of the Secretary-General concerning peace-enforcement units, as well \r\nas the negotiation of agreements in accordance with Article 43 of the Charter. \r\nProliferation of all weapons of mass destruction constitutes a major \r\nthreat to international peace and security. International norms of \r\nnon-proliferation should be strengthened through universal and credible \r\nadherence to them. \r\nFinland welcomes the recently concluded chemical-weapons convention. It \r\nis a vital and long-awaited part of the international non-proliferation regime \r\nand should attract as many original signatories as possible. Finland, for its \r\npart, will be among the first States to sign and ratify the convention. \r\nUnrestrained accumulation of conventional arms can lead to regional \r\ninstability. It is therefore essential that especially the major \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. Vayrynen. Finland) \r\narms-exporting countries should exercise restraint individually and \r\ncollectively. It is also necessary that all relevant transfers should be \r\nfully reported to the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms. \r\nThe Security Council summit represented a firm recommitment to the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The \r\nSecretary-General, for his part, has seized the momentum and turned this new \r\ncommitment into a programme for concrete action. In the promotion of peace \r\nand security, this is indeed the beginning of a new era in the history of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\nOn the same positive note, I should like to turn to another summit, the \r\nEarth Summit, held at Rio de Janeiro. Alongside the task of maintaining peace \r\nand security, a new equally courageous and visionary leadership is called for \r\non sustainable development. At Rio a remarkable number of Heads of State and \r\nGovernment responded to that call and drew guidelines for world-wide \r\nsustainable development. Although our expectations could not all be \r\nfulfilled, the Earth Summit showed that the United Nations and the \r\ninternational community can achieve remarkable results when minds meet. \r\nYet Rio was only the beginning of a long process towards sustainable \r\ndevelopment. In that process, a fundamental change is needed first and \r\nforemost in attitudes a change in our own life-styles. And we need a strong \r\npolitical will to direct that change. A sustainable future can be brought \r\nabout only by putting the treaties agreed upon at Rio into force and by \r\ntranslating the principles of the Declaration and Agenda 21 into action. In \r\nthis the Commission on Sustainable Development will have an essential role to \r\nplay. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n64-65 \r\n(Mr. Vayrynen. Finland) \r\nThe conventions signed at Rio are just an initial core for a \r\ncomprehensive legal framework, which should guide mankind in the right \r\ndirection. What we do need is a full set of internationally binding \r\nagreements which redirects production and consumption patterns in each and \r\nevery country. We also need effective conventions covering natural \r\nresources. Here instruments on desertification and sustainable forestry are \r\nthe most urgent ones. \r\nThe future of mankind requires sustainable development, management and \r\nconservation of forests of all types of forests everywhere. Forests have \r\nboth an important national dimension and an important global dimension. \r\nForests are a valuable national resource which must be utilized for the \r\nbenefit of the local population. Sustainable forestry is also economically \r\nbeneficial. While the sovereignty of nations over their forest resources \r\nshould be respected, that sovereignty should not be misused. \r\nFinland, for its part, is prepared to participate actively in launching \r\nthe negotiations on the global forest convention on the basis of the forest \r\nprinciples agreed upon at Rio. Here we have to build a better understanding \r\nof the need for such an international instrument. We also have to build \r\nmutual confidence founded on the unique role of forests in the global \r\necosystem. \r\nTo implement what was agreed at Rio is a tall order for any country, and \r\nparticularly for developing countries. Many of them will need the assistance \r\nof the international community and the United Nations. New and additional \r\nresources reguired by developing countries must be provided in a timely \r\nmanner. That is a heavy task for the donor community, as it has to shoulder \r\nthe responsibility of also assisting the new democracies in transition. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n66 \r\n(Mr. Vayrynen. Finland) \r\nThe results of the Earth Summit do indeed underline the unigue and \r\nindispensable role of the United Nations in promoting development. They will \r\nhave a crucial impact on the entire economic and social sector of the United \r\nNations and on the work of the Economic and Social Council. Development \r\ndeserves the same priority and attention as peace and security. \r\nDevelopment is not only economic and social progress; it is also \r\npromotion of democracy and human rights. No longer do questions of violations \r\nof human rights belong exclusively to the sovereign domain of States. On the \r\ncontrary, respect for human rights and democracy is an integral part of \r\ninternational relations. It is therefore one of the main responsibilities of \r\nthe United Nations to see to it that they are respected world wide. \r\nThe Economic and Social Council is the principal organ of the United \r\nNations for development. It is important and urgently necessary that the \r\nEconomic and Social Council be strengthened so that it can gain the true \r\nleadership role for sustainable development and promotion of human rights and \r\ndemocracy. \r\nThe demands put on the United Nations today are unprecedented. New \r\nchallenges have to be met and financed. Finland shares the \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s concerns regarding the Organization\u0027s ability to function \r\nin the present financial crisis. We are therefore willing to consider \r\nconstructively any of his proposals. Finland is particularly anxious to see \r\nthe General Assembly take the first step recommended by the Secretary-General: \r\nthe establishment of a peace-keeping reserve fund to meet the initial expenses \r\nof peace-keeping operations pending receipt of assessed contributions. The \r\nNordic countries have long advocated this step. With the recent expansion of \r\noperations, the need for such a fund is acute. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n67 \r\n(Mr. Vayrynen. Finland) \r\nIt is not in keeping with the honour, interests or legal obligations of \r\nthe Member States for the United Nations to exist in \"its present mendicancy\", \r\nto use the words of the Secretary-General. For members of any club, paying \r\ndues is \u003c» duty, not an option. While exceptional measures may be needed to \r\nguarantee the uninterrupted functioning of the United Nations in the present \r\ncrisis, the overall funding of the Organization must be built on the \r\ncollective responsibility of the entire membership. We have a common interest \r\nto invest in improved security and development towards a more prosperous and \r\ndemocratic world. \r\nThe United Nations Charter remains fully valid today as regards the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and, by and large, also as \r\nregards the promotion of international cooperation in the economic, social, \r\nand human rights sectors. In facing the new challenges, especially in the \r\npromotion of sustainable development and democracy, the primary issue is how \r\nwe can best build on the Charter and even amend it, where necessary. \r\nAs it approaches the end of the second millennium, humanity is faced with \r\nformidable challenges. Meeting them will not be easy; I have no illusions \r\nabout that. Yet the United Nations now has a. better chance than ever to use \r\nits full potential and show leadership for the sake of a better future. \r\nMr. PI TELLA (Argentina) (interpretation from Spanish): I should \r\nlike to congratulate the President on his election. I am convinced that his \r\nwork at this session will be crowned with success, as was that of his \r\npredecessor. Ambassador Shihabi, to whom we express our gratitude for his \r\noutstanding work. \r\nWe have noted with satisfaction how our Organization, in keeping with its \r\nuniversalist vocation, has increased its membership in the course of the past \r\nyear. We welcome the delegations of Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n68 \r\n(Mr. Pi Telia, Argentina) \r\nHerzegovina, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Moldova, Georgia, \r\nKazakhstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and San Marino. Their presence \r\nis perhaps the clearest demonstration of the deep-seated and positive changes \r\nthat have occurred in important parts of the world since the end of the cold \r\nwar. \r\nMoreover, we would like to extend our recognition to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, for his hard and valuable work in the \r\ncourse of the first year of his term of office, thereby continuing the \r\nexcellent job done by his predecessor, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. The \r\nSecretary-General\u0027s stewardship has already had a sizeable impact on the \r\ncurrent international situation. \r\nIn our view, the general panorama of international relations, despite \r\nsome serious regional conflicts, gives rise to promising prospects throughout \r\nthe world. The end of the cold war and the considerable extension of \r\ndemocracy and the economic opening-up in many countries encourage that \r\nperception. This will necessarily lead to a reformulation of the North-South \r\nrelationship that will replace confrontation with cooperation. That \r\nperception does not imply ignoring the seriousness of some regional conflicts, \r\nin particular in the former Yugoslavia or the tragic situation of such \r\ncountries as Somalia. Neither war, hunger, poverty nor disease has been \r\neliminated. Far from it: situations persist that evoke horror and concern. \r\nMorevoer, in some regions there are still significant disputes that, \r\nthough lacking the tragic aspects of the troubles I have mentioned, none the \r\nless impede the consolidation of stability. The case of the Malvinas Islands, \r\nto which I shall refer later, is one example. In that regard, the situation \r\nhas unfortunately been affected recently by unilateral positions taken by the \r\nBritish Government on the sensitive matters of hydrocarbons. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n69-70 \r\n(Mr. Pi Telia. Argentina) \r\nIn any case, apart from these issues, in recent years the world has taken \r\nimportant steps towards creating a better framework for solving serious \r\nproblems. The fundamental change has undoubtedly been the more effective \r\nfunctioning of the system of collective security established in San Francisco \r\nin 1945. That major development is the prerequisite for moving towards full \r\nrespect for the purposes and principles of this Organization. \r\nThat explains the fundamental role of the Security Council, to which the \r\nCharter allocated paramount responsibility for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, and the necessity for all States firmly to \r\nsupport that body and implement its decisions. \r\nConvinced of that, in keeping with Article 25 of the Charter we strongly \r\nsupport the decisions of the Security Council. We did so with regard to the \r\nGulf by participating in the coalition to liberate Kuwait, and we continue to \r\ndo so through our increasingly active presence in the peace-keeping operations \r\nof the United Nations. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n71 \r\n(Mr. Pi Telia. Argentina) \r\nOur support of the Security Council flows from our deeply-rooted beliefs \r\nabout the rules of conduct of civilized nations, from an appropriate \r\nassessment of the world power balance and from our perception of Argentina\u0027s \r\nactual interests. After long years of miscalculations and frustrations, today \r\nArgentina needs to grow and develop. Our chances of doing so depend to a \r\ngreat extent on our own efforts, but also on the existence of a world and \r\nregional context of dialogue and cooperation that will enable us to devote our \r\nenergy and resources to that task. As a result, we also favour the regional \r\ndevelopment of more specific formulas for cooperation with the United Nations. \r\nThere can be no doubt that the United Nations cannot on its own guarantee \r\nthe climate of detente that we need, which is to say that each region should \r\ncreate mechanisms of its own. We, therefore, together with other American \r\ncountries, have supported reforms to the charter of the Organization of \r\nAmerican States with a view to giving it the power to respond politically to \r\nbreakdowns in democracy in our hemisphere. The organization is studying \r\nspecific responses, which we trust will soon be adopted. \r\nBy the same token, we have contributed, together with our neighbours, to \r\nconsolidating a promising subregional framework. The climate of harmony and \r\ncooperation between the countries of the southern cone is a veritable example \r\nfor the world, and is the result of promising agreements on economic \r\nintegration, such as the Southern Cone Common Market, and of specific measures \r\nto build confidence and transparency in the area of security. Our countries \r\nare firmly united in the struggle against the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. Argentina, for its part, has turned this struggle into one of \r\nthe fundamental axes of its foreign policy. \r\nThe achievements have been particularly significant in the relationship \r\nbetween Argentina and Brazil; in a few short months, we have signed a \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n72 \r\n(Mr. Pi Telia. Argentina) \r\nbilateral agreement on nuclear safeguards, set up a bilateral agency for \r\naccounting and control of nuclear materials, signed an agreement on full \r\nsafeguards with the International Atomic Energy Agency - which has already \r\nbeen ratified by my country and have successfully pushed for amendments to \r\nthe Treaty of Tlatelolco to allow it to come fully into force. \r\nIn this latter effort we have also joined with Chile and, later, with \r\nMexico. The changes to the Treaty of Tlatelolco are very positive, since they \r\noffer guarantees that did not exist before on the control system, special \r\ninspections and the protection of technological secrets. Argentina, Brazil \r\nand Chile have committed themselves to beginning the process of legislative \r\napproval of the amendments promptly. We are sure that in a few months all of \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean will be protected by a nuclear-free zone in \r\nfull operation. \r\nIn addition to measures taken in the nuclear area, the southern cone \r\ncountries have signed the so-called Mendoza Peclaration on chemical and \r\nbacteriological weapons. This model document, which eradicates these weapons \r\nfrom our region, is in complete conformity with the Convention on Chemical \r\nWeapons recently negotiated in Geneva; that Convention has Argentina\u0027s \r\nsupport, and is an undeniable triumph in the struggle against the \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \r\nArgentina\u0027s firm commitment in this area has also been reflected in \r\nconcrete form in our domestic legislation. This year the Argentine Government \r\nissued a decree which regulates sensitive nuclear, chemical, bacteriological \r\nand missile exports, and incorporates major international agreements, such as \r\nthe Missile-Technology Control Regime (MTCR) outlines and the so-called \r\nAustralian \"List of chemicals\", into Argentina\u0027s legal system. It also \r\nstipulates that Argentina shall coordinate its actions in the area of \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n73 \r\n(Mr. Pi Telia. Argentina) \r\nnon-proliferation with other countries that have a similar approach. We plan \r\nto accept the invitation to join the group of nuclear-exporting countries in \r\nthe near future. Naturally, if the main elements of the MTCR are incorporated \r\ninto Argentine legislation, they would expect our country to become a member \r\nof that system. \r\nI should like to emphasize that, besides contributing effectively to \r\nnon-proliferation, the new policy should serve to reopen Argentina\u0027s access to \r\nhigh technology through international cooperation. Its former ambiguous \r\npolicy in this regard was a major obstacle in this field and was responsible, \r\nto a great extent, for the technological backwardness of our country, and for \r\nhindering procurement even of spare parts and minor supplies for our defence. \r\nAnother important contribution to stability in our part of the world has \r\nbeen the complete normalization of diplomatic relations between Argentina and \r\nthe United Kingdom and the development of growing and fruitful economic and \r\ntrade links between the two. However, the dispute concerning sovereignty over \r\nthe Malvinas, Georgia and South Sandwich islands still persists. Today I \r\nreaffirm the sovereign rights of my country over these territories and their \r\nmaritime areas. The permanent defence and reaffirmation of these inalienable \r\nrights are at the core of Argentine foreign policy. \r\nThus, the recent decision of the United Kingdom Government to move \r\nunilaterally into prospecting for oil in the area in dispute is strongly \r\nrejected by my country. This rejection has been immediately transmitted to \r\nthe United Kingdom Government and to the potential prospecting companies. \r\nThis imprudent step by the United Kingdom stands in the way of the real \r\nopportunities for cooperation in the South Atlantic and does not strengthen \r\nthe good bilateral relationship in which both countries are strongly \r\ninterested. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n74 \r\n(Mr. Pi Telia. Argentina) \r\nThese developments hinder our developing creative and pragmatic formulas \r\nwhich, without undermining our inalienable rights, would foster cooperation in \r\nthe South Atlantic. We are convinced that the establishment of a cooperative \r\nframework rather than of a confrontational one would benefit all those who \r\nlive in the South Atlantic area, including the inhabitants of the Malvinas. \r\nIt is the duty of the Argentine and British Governments to do their utmost \r\ntowards that end by overcoming major problems such as the ones that I have \r\ndescribed. \r\nThe Secretary-General is the author of the document entitled \"An Agenda \r\nfor Peace\" (A/47/277), which is a fundamental contribution towards outlining \r\nthe future structure of the United Nations. The document clearly indicates \r\nwhat road must be taken to strengthen the Organization, particularly in the \r\narea of preventing and ending conflicts. Argentina supports this document, \r\nwhich is to a great extent in line with the conclusions of the Rio Group. We \r\nshare, in particular, the opinion of the Secretary-General that it is \r\nnecessary to set in motion all the mechanisms of collective security provided \r\nfor in the Charter, in a framework of strict observance of the areas of \r\ncompetence established therein. \r\nPeace-keeping operations have become one of the main instruments of the \r\ninternational community. This year we have witnessed an unprecedented \r\nparticipation by the Blue Helmets in four continents. Argentina has decided, \r\nfor its part, as a major component of its foreign policy, to participate \r\nactively in this new development by providing military personnel and materiel. \r\nIn that connection, I wish to point out that the financing of \r\npeace-keeping operations must be effected in a manner that balances the need \r\nto ensure the effectiveness of such operations and the financial capabilities \r\nof Member States. In that connection, we emphasize the special \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n75 \r\n(Mr. Pi Telia. Argentina) \r\nresponsibilities of the permanent members of the Security Council in that \r\nrespect, as well as the greater capability of the more economically developed \r\ncountries to cope with such expenditures. \r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s report is at the same time an essential document \r\nin the development of approprite responses to current conflicts. Some of \r\nthese need decisive action on the part of the international community. \r\nIt is vital for us to continue to exert maximum pressure to put an end to \r\nthe tragedy in former Yugoslavia. Argentina supports the steps taken by the \r\nSecurity Council, the Secretary-General and the European Economic Community, \r\nand joins with those who demand respect for self-determination, for minorities \r\nand for the boundaries of the republics of former Yugoslavia. \r\nThe tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with which Argentina is in the \r\nprocess of establishing diplomatic relations, is a challenge to us all. We \r\njoin in the appeal to all parties to respect the principles I have mentioned, \r\nand we demand that Belgrade contribute effectively to putting an end to the \r\naggression in Bosnia and Herzegovina. \r\nThe presence of more than a thousand Argentine soldiers in the United \r\nNations Protection Force bears witness to our interest in a solution that \r\nrespects both the Charter of the United Nations and international law. \r\nWe are also following, with concern, the difficulties in Cambodia and the \r\nlack of progress in Western Sahara, and we are following political \r\ndevelopments in southern Africa with great attention. Argentina, for its \r\npart, is paying particular attention to the special situation in South \r\nAfrica. Argentina and South Africa share the South Atlantic area and have \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n75(a-z) \r\n(Mr. Pi Telia. Argentina) \r\ngreat opportunities for future cooperation. That is why we again urge the \r\nGovernment, the African National Congress of South Africa and all parties \r\ninvolved in the search for a concerted solution to persevere, through \r\nnegotiations, in their efforts to find a solution to the serious problem \r\ncreated by the policy of apartheid. The process of eradicating these terrible \r\npractices must be completed and, at the same time, the establishment of a \r\ndemocratic, free and peaceful society must be ensured in that great country. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n76 \r\n(Mr. Pi Telia. Argentina) \r\nI have mentioned the South Atlantic. We are firmly convinced that the \r\ntime has come for all the countries involved to set up concrete mechanisms of \r\ncooperation in that important maritime area. The South Atlantic is one of the \r\nfew areas in the world on which there are no specific agreements. Argentina \r\nadvocates decisive advancement in that area. \r\nProgress in the Peace Conference strengthens our hope for a solution to \r\nthe Arab-Israeli conflict. We feel that the role of the General Assembly at \r\nthis crucial stage is not so much to ratify well-known positions as it is to \r\ncontribute decisively to promoting agreement and flexibility among the \r\nparties. Argentina is prepared to cooperate actively in the efforts to \r\nachieve that goal. We must say that we feel deep admiration and respect for \r\nthe Middle Eastern leaders who have had the courage and vision to put aside \r\nthe rigidity of dialectics and undertake these crucial negotiations with \r\ndetermination and in a conciliatory spirit. \r\nWe Argentinians have also suffered the consequences of the irrational \r\nviolence unleashed everywhere as a result of that serious situation. The \r\nattack carried out last 17 March against the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, \r\nwith its heavy toll, was an unmistakable sign of the tragic imprint left by \r\nthese conflicts at the criminal hands of international terrorism. \r\nAs regards other regional situations, we are pleased to note the current \r\nprogress in the high-level talks between the Cypriot leaders and the \r\nSecretary-General. As a result, we look forward to a prompt agreement in the \r\nframework of the good-offices mission of the Secretary-General. We wish to \r\ncommend the parties involved in this conflict, including Greece and Turkey, \r\nfor their spirit of cooperation, and the permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil for their active role in this process. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n77 \r\n(Mr. Pi Telia. Argentina) \r\nWe reiterate our firm support of the Security Council decisions regarding \r\nthe situation in the Persian Gulf and we insist that Iraq should abide by its \r\nresolutions and fully respect the human rights of all minorities and of the \r\npopulation as a whole. \r\nOne of the essential conditions for peace is the full enjoyment of human \r\nrights. Argentina reaffirms its active role in the protection and promotion \r\nof human rights and fundamental liberties in the deliberative international \r\nbodies on human rights, both at the United Nations and the Organization of \r\nAmerican States (OAS). \r\nIt is also fitting to mention some serious problems that the \r\ninternational community must face, attack and eliminate once and for all. I \r\nam referring to drug trafficking, terrorism and corruption. \r\nThe first one drug trafficking - is at present a subject deserving of \r\nconcerted action by States. This, however, is not enough. We must get to the \r\ndeepest roots of this scourge at all its stages, from production to \r\nconsumption, and in particular the movement and laundering of its financial \r\nresources. In their actions in this area, States must recognize the various \r\ncharacteristics of the countries that are most involved. Argentina has joined \r\nand will join any initiative that will allow us to put an end to this malady \r\nthat affects the whole of the international community, without exception. \r\nAs for terrorism, there can be no questions, only an answer in the form \r\nof the strongest, most determined and implacable commitment of each State to \r\nstruggle against it until it is eradicated. Its activities are always deadly \r\nand cruel. This year Argentina suffered one of the most savage terrorist \r\nattacks in the annals of international crime. Our country will support all \r\nsteps or processes that will strengthen law and the respect for standards of \r\ncoexistence among nations. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n78 \r\n(Mr. Pi Telia. Argentina) \r\nFinally, the cancer of corruption must be rooted out. It is harmful and \r\npernicious and undermines the efforts of States and their civilian societies \r\nfor the healthy development of their political, economic and social \r\ninstitutions. Corruption knows no borders and coexists, or attempts to do so, \r\nwith any political or legal system on our planet. Argentina is in the front \r\nlines of the struggle to combat this crime and to create the mechanisms for \r\ndoing so. \r\nAllow me to return to our region and refer to some other facts of great \r\nsignificance. \r\nArgentina\u0027s foreign policy is geared towards creating an external context \r\nfavourable to the competitive incorporation of Argentina into the world \r\neconomy. In that regard, we have made the Southern Cone Common Market \r\n(MERCOSUR) the axis of our activity in Latin America. The agreement on trade \r\nand investment with the United States, called \"Four plus One\", shows that the \r\nconcepts of MERCOSUR and the Initiative for the Americas are fully \r\ncompatible. With MERCOSUR we endeavour to create a stable external context \r\nfor the economic growth of the four countries through the implementation of \r\ncollective economic discipline freely agreed upon by the parties. The concept \r\nis characterized by a marked realism as to our potential and limitations. \r\nMERCOSUR is not, nor could it be, the embryo of a new economic fortress. \r\nBefore the end of 1994 we will have a common external tariff, but we have \r\nalready clearly determined that it must allow for the increasing international \r\ncompetitiveness of our economies. It would make no sense to close at the \r\nsubregional level the doors that each of our countries is opening at the \r\nnational level. \r\nThe reference to MERCOSUR leads me to recall that Argentina expects the \r\ncreation of great economic blocs to be the forerunner of freer, more efficient \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n79 \r\n(Mr. Pi Telia. Argentina) \r\ninternational trade, not of a greater space to make protectionism legal or to \r\ndisguise clear market reserves. Argentina prefers to believe in the sincerity \r\nof the purposes stated in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on \r\nTariffs and Trade (GATT) and in the principles outlined to launch the \r\nInitiative for the Americas, the same ones that form the basis of the Treaty \r\nof Asuncion, in which MERCOSUR is defined. But my country notes with \r\njustifiable concern the way in which the most powerful economies on our planet \r\ninterpret the concept of opening the market, since they promote such opening \r\nonly for those sectors in which their countries are competitive or where they \r\nthemselves exert influence on international prices. \r\nPart of that conception is to be found in the section on agriculture and \r\nother decisions that have so far stalled the Uruguay Round of GATT. Precisely \r\nin the agricultural sector, the leaders of those economies do not display \r\nexcessive courage or desire to put an end to annual subsidies of more than \r\n$300 billion for production and foreign trade, with which they distort \r\ninternational markets and, besides, contribute to environmental degradation. \r\nSome of their decisions reflect a greater interest in solving minor \r\ndifficulties in domestic policy than in avoiding isolationism and trade wars. \r\nOnly very rich countries can pursue policies that are so harmful and costly \r\nthat they undermine the finances of their urban populations and of course do \r\nconsiderable harm to the developing countries. \r\nThis is also an apt occasion to confirm our great satisfaction at the \r\npolitical agreements reached by Canada, the United States and Mexico to create \r\na free-trade zone. We trust that this achievement will be one of the central \r\nmodules of the broader zone foreseen when launching the Initiative for the \r\nAmericas to make of the hemisphere one great market. While this takes shape, \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n80 \r\n(Mr. Pi Telia. Argentina) \r\nwe are worried at the many legislative attempts fiat tend to hinder the access \r\nof developing countries to the various international markets. \r\nArgentina has started a process of sustained economic stability based on \r\na market economy in the framework of a democratic system. This has allowed us \r\nto initiate proceedings for our admission to the Organisation for Economic \r\nCooperation and Pevelopment (OECD), where we hope to take part in the \r\ndiscussion of global and sectoral economic policies that may contribute to \r\neconomic growth. \r\nAt this session, the General Assembly will consider the report of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and Development held at Rio de \r\nJaneiro. No previous international event had convened so many Heads of State \r\nor of government. In the framework of the new international situation, it has \r\nbeen possible for the first time ever to reach basic agreements on guestions \r\nthat are important for the survival of this planet as we know it. \r\nThe progress achieved on the American continent does not preclude the \r\npersistence of some specific problems. At the last two sessions of the United \r\nNations Commission on Human Rights, Argentina made clear its position \r\nregarding the situation in Cuba. At all times my country has expressed a \r\ndesire that Cuba should bring about the necessary reforms to allow its full \r\nintegration, both political and economic, into the community of democratic, \r\npluralistic nations. I repeat that it was expressed as a brotherly wish, not \r\nas interference in the affairs of that country \r\nArgentina strongly condemned the coup d\u0027etat against the President of \r\nHaiti and supported the relevant resolutions adopted by the Organization of \r\nAmerican States (OAS). I myself was part of the delegation that accompanied \r\nthe Secretary-General of the OAS to Port-au-Prince. We have kept our \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n80(a-z) \r\n(Mr. Pi Telia. Argentina) \r\ndiplomatic ties with Haiti, have maintained our embassy there and have spared \r\nno effort to support an understanding between the parties to the conflict. \r\nAs regards El Salvador, the signing of the peace agreement is a landmark \r\nin the process of peace-making in Central America and we hope that the \r\nunderstanding reached can be extended to the rest of the region. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n81 \r\n(Mr. Pi Telia. Argentina) \r\nPeru, our sister country on the Pacific, continues to face serious \r\nproblems in its development and progress, suffering the effects of drug \r\ntrafficking and of bloody nihilistic terrorism. We should, however, note the \r\nadvances recently made on that front. We also welcome the process which will, \r\nwe hope, lead to a well-balanced and full return of Peru\u0027s representative \r\ndemocracy. We are awaiting with close attention and a willingness to \r\ncooperate the constituent elections of 22 November. \r\nWith regard to Chile, we continue to move slowly and inexorably closer to \r\na final solution to all of the unresolved border problems, along the world\u0027s \r\nthird longest frontier. Very little still remains to be done before we reach \r\na full understanding, which is already yielding fruitful results in advance, \r\nwith greater and very promising economic cooperation. We are replacing a long \r\nhistory of discord with a full and fraternal relationship. \r\nI cannot conclude without commenting on the actions of the Rio Group. I \r\nreaffirm my conviction that it has proved to be a highly effective mechanism \r\nfor consultations and for reaching political agreements, as was shown in such \r\nsituations as the one which earlier this year endangered institutional \r\nstability in Venezuela. The Rio Group has also demonstrated an important \r\npresence and participation in connection with Peru and Haiti. It has provided \r\nan excellent tool for communication, information and consultation with, \r\ninter alia, the European Community, with which, in addition to the enormously \r\nimportant Santiago Declaration in May of this year, a significant cooperation \r\nagreement was signed. \r\nIn 1992 we have been able to confirm that the United Nations, free of the \r\nshackles imposed on it by the cold war, is now fulfilling the essential role \r\nentrusted to it by mankind in 1945. Although the sources of distress still \r\npersist, we can affirm that we are moving towards the consolidation of the \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n82 \r\n(Mr. De Telia. Argentina) \r\nruling principles that guide the United Nations, and we reiterate our hopeful \r\nconviction that the closing years of the strife-torn twentieth century will \r\nenable us to strengthen universal respect for the letter and spirit of the \r\nCharter, which will mean the triumph of wisdom, solidarity and justice. \r\nMr. NGINGA (People\u0027s Republic of Angola) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): Allow me, first of all, on behalf \r\nof the Angolan Government and on my own behalf, to congratulate you. Sir, on \r\nyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh \r\nsession and to wish you success in carrying out your mandate. I am sure that \r\nyour experience and competence will guarantee the success of our work. The \r\nAngolan delegation wishes from the outset to assure you of our complete \r\ncooperation. \r\nTo the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Samir Shihabi, I should \r\nlike to express my appreciation for the valuable work done during his mandate. \r\nTo Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, I express my Government\u0027s \r\nprofound appreciation of his goodwill and selfless efforts, demonstrated in \r\nthe constant search for just and lasting solutions aimed at preserving peace \r\nand international security. \r\nMy Government supports and will contribute in a positive way to the \r\nrealization of the valuable concepts formulated in his report \"An Agenda for \r\nPeace\", whose sub-heading includes the words \"Preventive diplomacy\" (A/47/277). \r\nOn behalf of the Government and people of Angola, I wish to welcome the \r\nnew States that have been admitted to the United Nations; we are certain that \r\ntheir participation will contribute to the Organization\u0027s betterment. \r\nThe world has witnessed important political transformations occurring in \r\nAngola in the past. The armed conflict that had ravaged the country since \r\n1975 was ended with the signing of the Bicesse Accords on 31 May 1992. There \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n83 \r\n(Mr. Noinga. Angola) \r\nis no occasion more appropriate than the present one to sum up the situation \r\nwhich has followed the peace accords. The Angolan people is preparing for and \r\nawaiting with great expectations the holding of the first multiparty general \r\nelections on 29 and 30 September, which demonstrate my Government\u0027s \r\ndetermination to comply with the obligations it has assumed under the Bicesse \r\nAccords. \r\nWhile the incidents taking place in my country represent transitional \r\noccurrences in a process as complex as ours, their recurrence in almost all \r\nparts of the country is a source of grave concern to my Government and to the \r\nAngolan people. In this regard my Government believes that the United Nations \r\nand the rest of the international community have an important role to play \r\nduring this decisive phase of the Angolan peace process. \r\nThe environment of peace and relative tranquillity that prevails in my \r\ncountry is the result of persistent and arduous work and of the tenacious will \r\nof the Angolan people, which counted upon the international community. The \r\nAngolan people has provided proof of civilian rule and political maturity by \r\nspontaneously and massively participating in electoral registration and in all \r\nthe activities which will bring about the elections in spite of the difficulty \r\nin communications. \r\nOf the estimated number of slightly more than 5 million voters, \r\n4.8 million have registered. The national electoral council has demonstrated \r\nforesight and has performed its work with praiseworthy efficiency. And from \r\nthis podium, I wish to express once more Angola\u0027s appreciation to all those \r\ncountries and organizations which lent us their support in so many forms. \r\nMy Government sincerely hopes that before the election definitive accords \r\ncan be reached on certain aspects which continue to be a source of concern \r\nwith regard to the conduct of free and fair elections at the end of this \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n84-85 \r\n(Mr. Nginga, Angola) \r\nmonth. I am speaking, in particular, of the disbanding of the present \r\ngovernmental armed forces and the military wing of UNITA, of the cessation of \r\nthe wave of violence and intimidation provoked by the Government\u0027s \r\nco-signatory to the Bicesse Accords and of the formation of a national army. \r\nThe process of peace and democratization under way in my country, to \r\nwhich I have previously referred as a historic event in the life of Angola, \r\ncannot but have positive repercussions and effects in the international \r\nsphere. Associated with this is another factor of profound significance for \r\nthe southern region of our continent. I am referring to the negotiations \r\nbeing conducted in South Africa within the framework of the Convention for a \r\nDemocratic South Africa (CODESA), which Angola considers the most appropriate \r\nmeans to find a fair, lasting and satisfactory solution for all the parties \r\ninvolved. \r\nAs a result, Angola supports and shares the African position that CODESA \r\nshould achieve concrete objectives, such as the establishment of a \r\ntransitional government and the creation of mechanisms for elaborating a \r\nconstitution for a democratic South Africa and for holding free elections \r\nbased on the principle of \"one person, one vote\". \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n86 \r\n(Mr. Nginga. Angola) \r\nI should like also to make reference to the situation in Mozambique and \r\nin other parts of the African continent. The Angolan people stand in \r\nsolidarity with our brethren in Mozambique. For that reason, my Government \r\nencourages the Government of Mozambique to persevere in its peace effort for \r\nthe country and urges the international community to give its assistance to \r\nthe parties involved with a view to achieving peace and national \r\nreconciliation. \r\nAnother question that still worries us is the unjust situation that \r\npersists in East Timor. The position of the Angolan Government is well known \r\nby all; we continue to defend the principle of direct negotiations between \r\nPortugal, as the administering Power, and Indonesia, without excluding the \r\npresence of the legitimate representatives of the Maubere people, so that a \r\ncomprehensive solution can be found, taking into consideration the aspirations \r\nof the Maubere people. In this context, we express our wish that the next \r\nmeeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia and Portugal, under \r\nthe auspices of the Secretary-General, will produce positive results. \r\nIn relation to Western Sahara, my Government supports the holding of a \r\nreferendum in that Territory and sincerely hopes that the obstacles that still \r\nexist will be removed as soon as possible. \r\nAngola looks with concern to the situation which prevails in the former \r\nSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, where the short-term outlook for \r\nreaching a lasting peace is poor, and where the lives of innocent people are \r\nbeing taken. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n87 \r\n(Mr. Nginga. Angola) \r\nIn relation to the Middle East, the Angolan Government has always \r\nfavoured holding an international conference to reach a comprehensive solution \r\non the Middle East, in particular the Palestinian question. Therefore, we \r\nsupport the rounds of negotiations that are taking place; we hope that \r\nalthough there are many obstacles to overcome, the concerted efforts and the \r\ngood will of the parties will bring positive results and that the tragedy of \r\nthe Palestinian people will finally end. \r\nA fact which cannot but bring us satisfaction and which has our total \r\nsupport and encouragement is the holding of direct negotiations between Israel \r\nand the other parties concerned on the occupied Arab territories. We hope \r\nthat those negotiations will yield fully satisfactory results for the parties \r\nparticipating in the negotiations, and that peace will finally be restored in \r\nthe region. \r\nIn our view, whatever measure is taken, or whatever solution is advised, \r\nwill never be satisfactory or lasting unless it takes into account and is \r\nbased upon the true interests and concerns of the peoples involved. \r\nThe great changes that have recently taken place in the international \r\narena have in a certain way dictated the necessity of providing our \r\nOrganization with greater dynamism in taking decisions and greater efficiency \r\nin implementing and monitoring them. \r\nThe increase in the membership of the Organization, while strengthening \r\nit numerically, has also created the need for greater participation, on an \r\nequitable basis, in the various agencies of the United Nations system which \r\nbear mandates of fundamental importance in resolving the affairs of mankind \r\nwith respect to problems of peace, international security, development and \r\nenvironmental protection. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n88 \r\n(Mr. Nginga. Angola) \r\nWe hope that the work under way for the restructuring and revitalization \r\nof the United Nations will take our needs into consideration. Angola \r\nconsiders such restructuring to be opportune provided it is directed towards \r\neliminating mechanisms for taking action that are outdated or are no longer \r\nattuned to the present reality, and provided that the restructuring has as its \r\nfundamental objective the strengthening of the role of the Organization to the \r\nbenefit of all mankind. \r\nIn recent decades the world economic situation has swung widely in \r\nvarious corners of the planet. But the general trend has been towards \r\npolarization. As a result, while we observe an increase in economic growth \r\nfor the developed countries, we note a substantial decrease in growth for \r\ndeveloping countries. The situation in some cases is critical. \r\nThe second Conference of the Least Developed Countries, held at Paris in \r\nSeptember 1990, concluded that the economic and social situation of those \r\ncountries as a whole has deteriorated over the past decade, since, with very \r\nrare cases of better performance, the average annual growth rate was \r\n2.2 per cent. In many cases the rates were negative. \r\nFaced with this sad reality, the Conference set forth a new programme of \r\naction for the present decade which provides for national and international \r\nmeasures in favour of these countries and indicates the basic principles which \r\nmust orient relations between those countries and other countries and \r\norganizations which cooperate with them for development. In each case, \r\neffective implementation of that programme will require serious and profound \r\nreflection, and commensurate action. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n89 \r\n(Mr. Nginga. Angola) \r\nWith the end of the cold war, a new era has begun in which decisions on \r\nmatters of world interest are dealt with more and more on the basis of \r\nconsultation and understanding, instead of confrontation and competition. \r\nThis has rapidly transformed isolated cases of integration into a general \r\ntrend, with countries in various regions organizing themselves into more \r\nclosely aligned economic and political entities. \r\nThis trend towards the formation of larger economic blocs will inevitably \r\ntransform the world economically and politically. This poses a challenge for \r\nwhich we must be duly prepared in order to avoid deepening still further the \r\ngap that separates rich countries from poor countries. It is a challenge with \r\nrespect to which all of us, rich countries and poor, large countries and \r\nsmall, must make a commensurate collective effort to maintain effective, \r\nmultifarious international cooperation directed always towards the development \r\nof the parties involved, based always upon the true needs of the development \r\nprocess. \r\nHowever, certain political situations are now viewed as faits accomplis. \r\nor as conditions to be perpetuated. These must be the object of immediate and \r\nradical revision, with a view to harmonizing positions and interests, and \r\nweakening wide barriers that impede true cooperation between countries and \r\nnations separated by vast differences in their levels of economic, social, \r\nscientific, technical, cultural and educational development. \r\nIn our view, this revision should consist, inter alia, of the following \r\nelements: abolition of protectionist measures by developed countries that \r\nblock or impede access to their markets for products from underdeveloped \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n90 \r\n(Mr. Nginga. Angola) \r\ncountries, or their limitation to those that are strictly necessary; total or \r\npartial cancellation by the developed countries of the underdeveloped \r\ncountries\u0027 external debt; in the granting of loans or credits, the imposition \r\nof no further conditions with respect to concomitant, mandatory adoption of \r\npolitical measures that are not always in keeping with the level of \r\ndevelopment of the beneficiary country; concessions or an increase in grace \r\nperiods, and rescheduling of payment; a reduction of interest rates and the \r\nnon-capitalization of interest; favouring of investments in nationally defined \r\nareas, with particular emphasis on industrial development; and transformation \r\nof technology and its application to development. \r\nThose are some of the basic aspects around which the strategy of \r\ninternational economic cooperation must revolve if we intend, as is our duty, \r\nto eliminate the poverty in which the majority of the inhabitants of our \r\nplanet languish. Poverty grows daily, especially in our African continent. \r\nIt is worsened by natural calamities that exacerbate the present grave \r\neconomic and social situation in Africa. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n91 \r\n(Mr. Nginga. Angola) \r\nAngola is a country with many natural resources. It exports petroleum, \r\ndiamonds, coffee and other products, and with the advent of peace we intend to \r\ndiversify fully our export products, in this manner participating more \r\neffectively in the division of international labour. \r\nHowever, we are concerned by the exaggerated protectionist measures \r\npractised by developed countries in international trade, which are manifest in \r\nthe unprecedented drop in the prices of raw materials and in the deterioration \r\nof the terms of trade, as well as the lack of success in the General Agreement \r\non Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiation rounds. \r\nAs a third world country, and with the objective of correcting the \r\ndistortion in its economy, Angola reformulated its socio-political situation \r\nwith measures which will necessarily have positive effects on the economic \r\nlife of the country and which are consonant with this new situation. We \r\nrecently adopted a Government programme of action designed to decentralize the \r\neconomy, liberalize trade, revitalize business, democratize the banking sector \r\nand encourage foreign investment. \r\nIn this manner, we believe that adequately carrying out this programme in \r\nresponse to these new conditions will permit us, as is our desire, to \r\nparticipate actively in international economic cooperative efforts, making our \r\ncontribution, to the extent possible, to the socio-economic development of \r\nAfrica and the world. \r\nAllow me to express here my country\u0027s profound interest in the need to \r\nprotect the environment. The Rio Conference, held in June this year, not only \r\nconstituted a means for an interesting exchange of experiences and viewpoints \r\nconcerning a most important programme but also provided a moment for \r\nreflection on the continuing need for coordinated efforts for the benefit of \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n92 \r\n(Mr. Nginga. Angola) \r\nall mankind. Most certainly, the Conference allowed us to see clearly that, \r\ngiven current trends in scientific and technical development, any brash \r\nmisstep detrimental to the environment could lead to the destruction of our \r\nplanet. \r\nI wish for this reason to reaffirm here my country\u0027s commitment to \r\nobserve and fully apply the decisions of the Conference and to express our \r\nreadiness to engage in unrestricted cooperation with the international \r\ncommunity in undertaking all necessary steps so that we, together, can save \r\nthe Earth. \r\nMr. SHAMUYARIRA (Zimbabwe): I should like, at the outset to \r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev, Peputy Prime Minister and \r\nForeign Minister of Bulgaria, on his unanimous election to the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly of the United Nations at its the forty-seventh session. \r\nHis election is recognition of his diplomatic skills and the respect for \r\ninternational law in his country. We are confident that the international \r\ncommunity will benefit from his presidency. \r\nI also take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to his \r\npredecessor. His Excellency Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, who \r\ndiligently presided over the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session in an \r\nexemplary manner. We thank him for his efforts. \r\nThe Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, \r\nhas been at the helm of our Organization for nearly a year now. We have \r\nalready appreciated his style of work and the vigorous responses to the \r\nvarious crises that have beset the international community. We want to \r\nreiterate our confidence in his work and our continuing support for his \r\nleadership. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n93 \r\n(Mr. Shamuyarira. Zimbabwe) \r\nI welcome into our midst, as others before me have done, the 12 new \r\nMembers of the United Nations. Their admission draws the United Nations \r\ncloser to the realization of the principle of universality of membership. \r\nThis development is particularly welcome at this time, when a rejuvenated and \r\nvigorous United Nations is closely involved in the resolution of many \r\nconflicts and crises around the world. It makes the pronouncements and \r\nactions of the world body that much more effective. \r\nIt has now become clear to all that the end of the cold war has not been \r\na panacea for the world\u0027s ills, especially the ills of third world countries. \r\nIn some areas, and in some respects, these problems have been compounded by \r\nthe upsurge in intense nationalism and new brands of religion. The end of the \r\ncold war has not yet brought tangible results and change for the Palestinian \r\npeople in the Middle East, the black majority in South Africa, or peace to the \r\npeoples of Afghanistan, Cambodia, the Western Sahara and many other areas of \r\nconflict in the world. However, new and determined efforts are being made to \r\nresolve some of these problems peacefully, and we hope that these efforts will \r\nsucceed. \r\nThe tenth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, held recently in Indonesia, \r\ndrew attention to the failure of all the multilateral talks aimed at narrowing \r\nthe gap between developed and third world countries. In many areas, this \r\neconomic gap has widened. The Summit confirmed the validity of the Movement \r\nin the current international situation, but it urged its members both to join \r\nhands in fighting the common economic and financial problems of the South and \r\nto promote economic cooperation among members of the South themselves. The \r\nfast-growing economies of South-East Asian countries have shown the capacity \r\nfor intra-regional cooperation among developing countries and what can be \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n94-95 \r\n(Mr. Shamuyarira. Zimbabwe) \r\nachieved. In the place of cold-war issues, the Movement has put economic and \r\nfinancial matters on its agenda, and we hope that these will be tackled very \r\nforcefully over the next three years. \r\nIn our region of southern Africa, our economic problems have been \r\ncompounded by the very severe drought we are all facing. In the past, we used \r\nto export large guantities of white maize, but this year we have had to import \r\n13 million tons of grain alone. Although the States in the region are fully \r\ncooperating in the areas of transport and energy supply, other areas of our \r\ncooperation would be greatly increased were the evil apartheid system in South \r\nAfrica brought to an end and a non-racial and democratic system established in \r\nthat country. \r\nThe regime of President F. W. de Klerk which has been commented upon by \r\na number of speakers has put the brakes on the transition process that was \r\nbeing discussed at the Convention for a Pemocratic South Africa (COPESA). It \r\nhas also very effectively undermined the entire process by condoning and \r\nabetting the escalating violence against innocent black people and \r\ndemonstrators. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n96 \r\n(Mr. Shamuyarira. ZimbahwM \r\nMr. de Klerk has lost credibility in the eyes of the international \r\ncommunity. He must take steps now to release all political prisoners; we are \r\ntold there are 140 prisoners still languishing in jail. He must abandon or \r\nclose down the single men\u0027s hostels, which are being used by armed gangs as \r\ncamps. He must forbid the carrying of any weapon for any purpose in public \r\nplaces. He should disband all extraterritorial battalions, such as Koevoet \r\nand Battalions 31 and 32; in fact, he should ban all private armies and \r\nmilitia units. These are not drastic measures by any means. They are the \r\nminimum steps that must be taken to level the playing field so that all South \r\nAfrican political parties and teams can play on it. \r\nThe current problems of prisoners, hostels, weapons and private militias \r\nare a direct consequence of the evil system of apartheid itself, which the \r\ninternational community has described as a crime against humanity. We must \r\nstress that that system has not yet ended, although some bold steps have been \r\ntaken in the last two years towards removing it. But it is still there. \r\nWe commend the role the international community has played, and continues \r\nto play, in South Africa in line with Security Council resolution 765 (1992) \r\nof 16 July 1992. It is still our belief that to deal adequately with the \r\nsituation of violence in the country a substantial number of observers many \r\nmore than the current 50 or so - should be dispatched to the country so that \r\nthey cover all potential flash points. Only a credible and effective \r\ninternational presence can prevent the violence and restore the confidence \r\namong the parties in South Africa that is necessary for successful \r\nnegotiations. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n97 \r\n(Mr. Shamuyarira. Zimbabwe) \r\nIt has become obvious that the international community has made the \r\ngreatest headway on the South African issue when it has acted in unison. We \r\nneed unity-in-action from the international community. The De Klerk \r\nGovernment must come out unequivocally on the side of majority rule as \r\nunderstood by all civilised nations, without any conditions or vetoes for \r\nminorities. The regime\u0027s primary responsibility is to provide security and \r\nsafety for all South Africans, and therefore it needs to take decisive action \r\nnot only for the protection of all citizens of the country, as I indicated \r\nearlier, but also to carry forward the current process of eliminating \r\napartheid through peaceful means. \r\nDevelopments elsewhere in our region give much greater cause for hope, \r\nbut the peace processes in question need to be carefully nurtured if success \r\nis to be guaranteed. In Angola adequate preparations appear to have been made \r\nfor the general elections that are to take place in the next few days. The \r\nVice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of Angola gave a detailed account of the \r\narrangements that have been made for the elections in that country. The \r\nAngolan people, he indicated, will be given an opportunity to elect a \r\ngovernment of their choice. \r\nThe greatest praise for this achievement must go to the Angolan people \r\nthemselves, who have shown great maturity and patriotism in the face of \r\ndifficulties and mutual suspicions nurtured by 16 years of war. Some praise \r\nmust, however, also go to the United Nations, which has steadfastly supported \r\nthe Angolan peace process, particularly through the deployment of the United \r\nNations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II), a peace-keeping operation in \r\nwhich my country, Zimbabwe, is also playing a modest part. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n98 \r\n(Mr. Shamuyarira. Zimbabwe) \r\nWe are glad that the problems that had arisen with regard to the \r\nregistration of voters, particularly logistical problems of access by \r\nvoter-registration officials to various parts of the country, have now been \r\nresolved and that incidents of violence in the electioneering process have not \r\nbeen allowed to get out of hand. We also commend the pledge by the main \r\nparties in the Angolan elections that they will respect the poll result and \r\nthat if they win they will endeavour to establish a government of national \r\nunity and reconciliation. The concept of bringing all sections of society \r\ninto government is indeed an act of statesmanship that takes into account the \r\ntraditions of the African people. \r\nWith regard to Mozambique, we believe that a comprehensive cease-fire \r\nwill be signed on 1 October 1992. We hope that this solemn commitment will be \r\nupheld and respected by all the signatories and, in fact, by all the \r\nMozambican people. After so many years of fighting, Mozambicans want peace, \r\ntranquillity and progress, but to achieve peace a lot of work still remains to \r\nbe done. There is need for flexibility on both sides, and for active \r\nparticipation by all States in the region, including the Republic of South \r\nAfrica, in the peace process. \r\nZimbabwe has done, and will continue to do, all in its power to help \r\nmaintain the momentum and keep the peace process in Mozambique moving \r\nforward. As all delegates are aware, the Rome Declaration envisages an \r\neventual United Nations monitoring role in Mozambique\u0027s electoral process, and \r\nwe trust that all States will support such an undertaking by this world body. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n99 \r\n(Mr. Shamuyarira. Zimbabwe) \r\nThe situation in Somalia, to which many speakers have referred, is a \r\ncause of deep concern in my country; 2 million people may die and 5 million \r\nneed food aid. The extent of the suffering, which is now labelled the world\u0027s \r\nworst human disaster, could have been greatly alleviated had the world body \r\nacted earlier and with speed. However, we commend the decisive steps that \r\nhave now been taken by the Security Council, especially the decision to \r\ndispatch 3,500 troops to protect food shipments and distribution. My country \r\nis proud to be participating in this operation, which is aimed at averting a \r\nfamine of genocidal dimensions in Somalia. \r\nWe urge the various clan militias in the country not to disrupt the \r\nUnited Nations effort, but to engage in negotiations aimed at reuniting and \r\nbringing peace to their tortured people. The leaders of the three political \r\nfactions in Somalia must be condemned for intensifying civil strife in a \r\nsociety that is already ravaged by so much famine and drought. They should \r\ninstead be unifying and reconciling their people, reconciling the nation, in \r\norder to enable it to withstand the drought more effectively. \r\nIn West Africa the continued elusiveness of a solution to the Liberian \r\nconflict is also a cause of grave concern. We commend the efforts of the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Governments to bring peace \r\nand democracy to Liberia. Fighting between rival factions in recent days may \r\nembroil forces of the ECOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) in more \r\nfighting and make the whole situation intractable. We urge our Liberian \r\nbrothers to put the safety and future of their people and country before \r\npersonal gain and aggrandizement, and we urge our ECOWAS brothers also to \r\ncontinue with their efforts in attempting to bring peace to Liberia. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n100 \r\n(Mr. Shamuyarira. Zimbabwe) \r\nThe crisis in the Middle East has dragged on for a long time, dating from \r\nthe cold-war era. Our hopes were raised that a solution would be found in the \r\ncurrent round of peace talks that began with the Madrid Conference. We still \r\nplace our hopes in that process, and hope that the advent of a Labour \r\nGovernment in Israel will result in a more imaginative and flexible attitude \r\nthat can lead to a solution adequately addressing the legitimate aspirations \r\nof the Palestinian people. Clearly, the new Israeli Government must accept \r\nthe principle of the complete withdrawal of its troops of occupation from \r\nPalestine and the assumption of full control by the Palestinians over their \r\nown resources, including water resources, as fundamental to the resolution of \r\nthe Palestinian issue. Further, it is important for the United Nations to \r\nassume a central role in the peace process, particularly as its resolutions \r\nserved as terms of reference for the Madrid Conference. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n101 \r\n(Mr. Shamuyarira. Zimbabwe) \r\nThere are many other areas of crisis and conflict that require, and are \r\ngetting, the attention of this world body, such as Cyprus, Cambodia, \r\nAfghanistan, Western Sahara and others. The United Nations must continue to \r\nensure that in Western Sahara, the referendum plan is carried out in a manner \r\nthat reflects the genuine aspirations of the Sahrawi people; that in Cambodia, \r\nfull and comprehensive implementation of the Paris Accords is achieved; that \r\nin Cyprus, a solution that preserves the unity of the country and its \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity is found; and that in Afghanistan also, \r\nthe unity of the country is ensured and peace realized. \r\nThe most explosive areas in the whole world today, however, remain the \r\ncountries of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the former \r\nSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which have been the subject of much \r\ncomment by earlier speakers. In these areas, once the communist parties that \r\nheld power collapsed, the remaining, separate ethnic entities were engulfed in \r\nintense local tribalism and in an upsurge of religious fundamentalism. Our \r\nexperiences in Africa reveal that social situations of tribalism and/or \r\nreligious fundamentalism cannot be resolved simply by calling an election, or \r\nby using military force alone; what is often required is a deliberate act of \r\nnational reconciliation that establishes a government of national unity and \r\ndistributes power and influence to every segment of the society. This is a \r\npolitical game in which there should be no losers: the purpose of an election \r\nbecomes that of establishing the relative strengths of the participating \r\nparties and therefore the weight or seats they should have in a government of \r\nnational unity. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n102 \r\n(Mr. Shamuyarira. Zimbabwe) \r\nIn the case of Yugoslavia, from the very beginning my delegation felt \r\nthat when the upsurge of tribal feeling hit that unhappy land, a conference of \r\nnational reconciliation should have been convened. If some tribes insisted on \r\ngetting out of the federal arrangement, they should have been required to sign \r\na treaty guaranteeing the rights of the minority tribes to power-sharing and \r\nto enforcement of full human rights within their own territories, \r\nbecause let us face it - the main problem in Yugoslavia is the patchwork of \r\ntribal units that are spread throughout that land. \r\nWe ourselves have never believed that the European Economic Community\u0027s \r\npolicy of early recognition of Croatia and Slovenia on the one hand and the \r\nsevere punishment of Serbia and Montenegro on the other would solve the \r\nproblems of tribal and religious feelings in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the \r\nnumbers in the ethnic mix are almost egual. We strongly condemn the obnoxious \r\npolicy of so-called ethnic cleansing by the competing tribes in Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina. \r\nThe expulsion or killing of any one person in the process of so-called \r\ncleansing does not solve any problem; instead, it creates a pyschological, \r\nvicious circle of communal violence. However, when we discuss the question of \r\nYugoslavia in this world body soon, we would urge a word of caution: to seek \r\nreconciliation and not to ridicule any of the warring tribes of former \r\nYugoslavia. The fact that persons drawn from different ethnic, racial, \r\nreligious, linguistic and cultural groups live together should be a point of \r\nstrength rather than weakness; in fact, former Yugoslavia used to pride itself \r\non that very fact. Here in the United States of America, the country draws \r\nmuch strength from the cultural diversity of its people, who live together \r\nhappily under one political system. That is broadly what we should aim at in \r\nthe context of the Balkans. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n103 \r\n(Mr. Shamuyarira. Zimbabwe) \r\nThe subject of restructuring the United Nations system has been on our \r\nagenda for some time now. My delegation put some specific proposals before \r\nthe summit of world leaders held here last January. The thrust of our \r\ncontribution was the need to democratize the international system and the \r\nempowerment of the voice of third world countries within that system. \r\nWe are pleased that the Secretary-General has followed up the work of \r\nthat summit with a comprehensive statement entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\" \r\n(A/47/277). We agree with most of the well-thought-out conclusions and \r\nsuggestions in the report; in particular, we agree with the emphasis he puts \r\non democratic practices and the commitment to full human and political rights \r\nwithin our societies. On the subject of tribalism and nationalism, which we \r\nhave been discussing, he says: \r\n\"if every ethnic, religious or linguistic group claimed statehood, there \r\nwould be no limit to fragmentation, and peace, security and economic \r\nwell-being for all would become ever more difficult to achieve\". \r\n(A/47/277, para. 17) \r\nWe also endorse the recommendation that more should be done to assist the \r\ncountries that become victims of economic sanctions applied by this world body \r\nagainst other States. A meaningful and fair programme and mode of \r\ncompensation for victim States would encourage them to apply United \r\nNations-sponsored sanctions more faithfully, which would result in greater \r\neffectiveness of those sanctions. \r\nIt is also our view that the United Nations should have its own dedicated \r\nand committed armed units on a permanent basis, so that in its enforcement \r\nactions the world body acts as the world body, not as only some of its parts \r\nor some of its Members. The Charter itself provides for the United Nations to \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n104 \r\n(Mr. Shamuyarira. Zimbabwe) \r\nfunction in that fashion, and we believe that it is time the relevant \r\nprovisions in this regard were reactivated. \r\nGiven the centrality of the Security Council to the question of the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, any discussion of security \r\nissues cannot be complete without a look at the procedures of that body \r\nitself. We are aware of the circumstances in which the power of veto was \r\ngiven to those who now possess it in the Council. The point at issue now is \r\nwhether arrangements that appeared fair or at least justifiable 47 years \r\nago are still viable today. We believe this is an issue which needs rational \r\ndiscussion in which all States would participate egually and all views would \r\nbe given a fair hearing. Only such a fair exchange of views can result in the \r\npeaceful new world order that we are all seeking. \r\nNeedless to say, conflicts are not only the result of injustice within \r\nand among nations but also the result of poverty, want and despair. The past \r\ndecade has seen a massive deterioration in the standards of living of peoples \r\nin the developing world. This poverty is traceable not only to the policies \r\nof individual third world Governments but also to the capricious and \r\npernicious international environment in which they operate: not only have the \r\nprices for raw materials - the mainstays of our economies - been seriously \r\ndepressed throughout the past decade, but we have also faced extremely high \r\ninterest rates and increased protectionism from the markets of developed \r\ncountries. Far from being recipients of capital, we have become net exporters \r\nof hard currency, and today we jointly labour under a foreign debt of some \r\n$1.3 trillion. Some of us have, in addition to all this, suffered natural \r\ndisasters such as the drought, to which I have referred, that is ravaging \r\nsouthern Africa at the present time. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n105 \r\n(Mr. Shamuyarira. Zimbabwe) \r\nPoverty and want breed despair, and despair, of course, breeds conflict. \r\nIf the international community is to address peace and security issues \r\nadequately, it needs to attend seriously to the causes of despair in the world \r\ntoday. There can be no human right greater than the right to food, the right \r\nto shelter and the right to life itself and, during life, the right to \r\nliteracy. The world body and its specialized agencies must address these \r\nissues as a matter of urgency. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n106 \r\n(Mr. Shamuyarira, Zimbabwe) \r\nIn this regard, we are pleased at the plethora of projects now under way \r\nto make the United Nations focus on issues of economic development and social \r\nand humanitarian issues, such as the Nordic project. We believe the time has \r\nalso come when a frank appraisal should be made of the global economy with a \r\nview to eliminating some of the built-in obstacles to growth for developing \r\ncountries. \r\nI must return again to the theme of the Movement of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries, namely, how to close the widening economic gap between rich and \r\npoor nations. My delegation supports the convening of an international \r\nconference on social development, planned for 1994 or 1995. Such a gathering \r\nwould assist in defining clearly the basic needs of human beings on this Earth \r\nin this nuclear age, needs which must be met in order for them to live a \r\ndecent, satisfying and enriched life - in answer to the guestion. What does \r\nan ordinary human being need? and it would also map out a genuine path of \r\ndevelopment for third world countries in the South. The conference could play \r\na very important part in showing the correct path to development. The paths \r\nthat have been chosen for development have led us in different directions, and \r\nsome of them have led us into culs-de-sac. We need to think deeper and to act \r\nmore decisively in order to chart the correct path. To that extent, we \r\nstrongly support the convening of the conference on social development. \r\nThat should be the essence of the new world order to which we should all \r\naspire. It should be an international order guided by the twin objectives of \r\nuniversal peace and security, on the one hand, and an improved quality of life \r\nfor all the Earth\u0027s inhabitants, on the other. It must also be an order \r\ncharacterized by justice and respect for international law. We third world \r\ncountries should join enthusiastically in the promotion of the current Decade \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n107 \r\n(Mr. Shamuyarira. Zimbabwe) \r\nof International Law, because that is our only shield against the arbitrary \r\nactions of some big Powers. Our sovereignty and our national \r\nself-determination are deeply rooted in our political philosophies, of various \r\nkinds, but they are also anchored in the practice of international law. We \r\nshould uphold that shield even more vigorously in the so-called new world \r\norder that is emerging. We should also uphold the Charter of the United \r\nNations, which gives us some of the basic principles on which the \r\ninternational system has operated for so many years, nearly half a cencury. \r\nToday we stand at a crossroads. The collapse of the old order gives us \r\nthe rare opportunity to build something new in its place. Shall we use this \r\nopportunity wisely, or not? History has taught us salutary lessons about the \r\nprice mankind has had to pay for opportunities that are missed. In our \r\ndeliberations in this forum and in others, we shall all help determine the \r\nshape of this new order that is coming. Zimbabwe intends to participate, with \r\nothers, actively in that debate to ensure that the much-heralded new world \r\norder will be a just, humane and enlightened one that will bring an \r\nimprovement to the quality of life of all of humanity and provide for the \r\nbasic needs of all human beings, and especially in our developing societies. \r\nThe global community has the means and the capacity to provide for those basic \r\nneeds. \r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): I shall now call on \r\nthose representatives who wish to speak in exercise of the right of reply. \r\nMay I remind members that, in accordance with General Assembly \r\ndecision 34/401, statements in exercise of the right of reply are limited to \r\n10 minutes for the first intervention and to five minutes for the second and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n108 \r\nMr. MORA GODOY (Cuba) (interpretation from Spanish): A few minutes \r\nago we heard the statement of the Minister from Argentina, in which he \r\nreferred to my country and expressed a fraternal aspiration for the future of \r\nCuba. Such an aspiration cannot be a friendly one, and we reject it. It \r\nwould be really friendly and fraternal if he would express concern for Cuba \r\nwith a view to rejecting the growing external aggression and the hostile \r\npolicy of which our country is the victim, and if he would demand respect for \r\nthe sovereignty and national integrity of Cuba, as he does for his own \r\ncountry, in accordance with the principles of international law and the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. \r\nThat would be an aspiration worthy of being expected from a Latin \r\nAmerican representative. However, the statement of the representative of \r\nArgentina coincides, and is in line, with the position of the Government of \r\nthe United States. We do not recognize in it any fraternal concern, inasmuch \r\nas the role he is playing would, in this case, be the role of Cain. \r\nMr. RICHARDSON (United Kingdom): I apologize for taking the floor \r\nat this late hour; however, in his address a short while ago, the Foreign \r\nMinister of Argentina referred to the alleged sovereign rights of his country \r\nover the Falkland Islands, the Georgias and the South Sandwich islands and \r\nover their maritime jurisdiction. \r\nI must repeat that my Government has no doubts about its sovereignty over \r\nthe British dependencies in the South Atlantic. \r\nThe Foreign Minister also referred to the \"imprudence\" of the British \r\nGovernment in advancing unilaterally in oil prospecting in the area in \r\ndispute. In fact, the announcement by the British Geological Survey of the \r\nintention of the Falkland Islands Government to invite applications to \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n109-110 \r\n(Mr. Richardson. United Kingdom) \r\ncarry out seismic surveys will have come as no surprise to the Argentine \r\nGovernment, which has been kept informed at every stage from the beginning \r\nabout the invitation to apply. \r\nMy Government therefore rejects any suggestion that it has acted \r\nimprudently. We will continue to work with the Argentine Government to create \r\nan atmosphere of stability and cooperation in the South Atlantic, and we have \r\nmade considerable progress in that respect. That progress is predicated on \r\nthe understanding that sovereignty is not a matter that we are prepared to \r\ndiscuss. \r\nMr. CHIARADIA (Argentina) (interpretation from Spanish): My \r\ndelegation wishes to refer to the statement we heard recently from the \r\ndelegation of Cuba. \r\nWe do not believe that this is the right time to cast doubt on the value \r\nof democracy. The Argentine delegation, through its Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, simply said, and I shall quote, that: \r\n\"At all times, my country has expressed a desire that Cuba should bring \r\nabout the necessary reforms to allow its full integration, both political \r\nand economic, into the community of democratic, pluralistic nations.\" \r\n(supra, p. 80) \r\nI have nothing to add to that, and simply wish to reaffirm those words. \r\nWith regard to the statement by the delegation of the United Kingdom, I \r\nsimply wish to reaffirm in all respects the references the Minister of Foreign \r\nAffairs of my country made in this Hall to the guestions to which the United \r\nKingdom delegation alluded. \r\nA/47/PV.5 \r\n111 \r\nThe PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): I now call on the \r\nrepresentative of Cuba, who wishes to speak a second time in exercise of the \r\nright of reply. The intervention is limited to five minutes. \r\nMr. MORA GODOY (Cuba) (interpretation from Spanish): Really, I am \r\nnot going to use up my five minutes, but I am going to say that neither is \r\nthis the moment to be trifling with the interests of the powerful, and I shall \r\nalso reaffirm that what happens in Cuba, as far as our system is \r\nconcerned - and I think the representative of Argentina forgot this in his \r\nspeech is decided by the Cuban people and nobody else. \r\nThe meeting rose at 7.15 p.m. \r\n"
