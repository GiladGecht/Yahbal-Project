President of the Republic of Djibouti, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic of Djibouti, \r\nHis Excellency El Hadj Hassan Gouled Aptidon, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\nPresident APTIDON (interpretation from French): First of all, let \r\nme convey to all members of the General Assembly the greetings of the people \r\nof Djibouti. \r\nI should like to take this opportunity to address to you, Mr. President, \r\nmy warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its forty-seventh session. I am convinced that you will guide our \r\ndeliberations in such a way as to bring them to a successful conclusion, and I \r\nwish you every success. \r\nThat was the case at last year\u0027s session, at which Mr. Samir Shihabi, \r\nAmbassador of a great fraternal country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, presided \r\nover the General Asssembly. We are indebted to him for the important \r\nachievements in the field of restructuring and revitalizing the United \r\nNations. I should like to express to the former Permanent Representative, who \r\nis leaving us, our best wishes for the future. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n3-5 \r\n(President Aptidon) \r\nI should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the son of Africa \r\nand the Arab world, my brother and friend Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, for the dignified and enlighted way \r\nin which, for almost a year, he has been discharging his duties in the \r\nSecretariat. I wish to emphasize that my country fully appreciates the \r\nefforts Mr. Boutros-Ghali is making to find lasting solutions to the various \r\ncrises and wars throughout the world, thus promoting peace and international \r\ncooperation. \r\nMoreover, in his annual report on the activities of the Organization, the \r\nSecretary-General has highlighted the many vital issues before the United \r\nNations ranging from the Organization\u0027s financial crisis to its added \r\nresponsibilities as a result of the changes under way, which are sorely \r\ntesting the resources available to the Organization. \r\nIn this respect, the establishment by the Secretary-General of an \r\nadvisory group of eminent persons to study and formulate proposals to make the \r\nUnited Nations financially solvent seems to us to be an appropriate and timely \r\ninitiative. \r\nLastly, it is with great pleasure that I welcome the States which have \r\njoined the United Nations this year. \r\nThe end of the cold war has brought important issues into sharp focus, \r\nnamely, sovereignty, peace-keeping and democracy. National boundaries are \r\nfast collapsing and internal civil strife is growing with increasing intensity. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n6 \r\n(President Aptidon) \r\nThe changing context of the international political landscape and the \r\nconcomitant flareup of conflicts in many regions of the world are sufficient \r\nreason to reflect upon new ways and means to contain the evolving threats to \r\ninternational peace and security. In that regard, the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\nAgenda for Peace contains ideas and proposals such as the use of preventive \r\ndiplomacy, peace-keeping and peace-making; it deserves the fullest attention \r\nof the General Assembly. \r\nStates new and old are ravaged by ethnic and clan rivalries. The United \r\nNations therefore needs the unwavering support of the international community \r\nin order to be able to respond urgently, effectively and substantially to \r\nthese new phenomena of our time. Will the nascent democracies, in their weak \r\nand poorly equipped condition, be able to cope with urgent demands for \r\nmaterial improvement? And if they cannot deliver, could they not lose popular \r\nsupport? Democracy under relatively favourable conditions is obviously far \r\ndifferent both in theory and in practice indeed, in every respect from \r\ndemocracy in a country in a vicious circle of dependence, poverty and \r\ninstability. \r\nThe proliferation of political parties in a pluralistic system invariably \r\nleads to parties based on ethnicity. Clearly, there must be an alternative \r\nframework for these democracies suffering from dire economic conditions and \r\nfrom chronic problems of debt, disease, hunger and poverty. The Speaker of \r\nNamibia\u0027s National Assembly described the situation forthrightly: \r\n\"We have learned that once you have acquired a constitution and achieved \r\nthe goal of political independence and freedom, you will find that you \r\ncannot eat votes in a ballot box\". \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n7 \r\n(President Aptidon) \r\nIn Africa and many countries elsewhere in the developing world, we see \r\npressure being exerted to reduce and disperse national sovereignty. This is a \r\ndangerous precedent in the new regional and international order that is \r\nemerging. In his address to the summit of non-aligned countries at Jakarta, \r\nthe Secretary-General forcefully expressed his apprehension, saying that \r\n\"Recent geopolitical changes are characterized by a greater degree \r\nof homogeneity in the world, which we welcome as a precious harbinger of \r\nconcord and unity. Yet neither decolonization nor the dismantling of the \r\nblocs has erased the phenomenon of power. Attempts to dominate, either \r\nworld-wide or regionally, remain. They continue to threaten the weakest \r\nand poorest States, which are still the most numerous in the world\". \r\nI share the view of the Secretary-General that the new world order must \r\nbe based on democracy in international relations, and that at the same time \r\neach of us, particularly the developing countries, must remain steadfast on \r\nthe fundamental principles of national sovereignty, non-intervention in the \r\ninternal affairs of a State, and international cooperation. \r\nIn my last address to this Assembly, on 21 September 1977, on the \r\noccasion of my country\u0027s admission to the United Nations, I described in \r\naddition to the joy we felt on acceding to our freedom my determination to \r\ncontribute to adherence to respect for human rights in the Horn of Africa. \r\nThat ambition was no doubt too lofty, or premature, for since then too many \r\nevents - often tragic have occurred; their harmful consequences show no sign \r\nof abatement. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n8-10 \r\n(President Aptidon) \r\nWe are aware of, and grateful for, the vital and essential role played by \r\nthe Secretary-General in bringing the question of Somalia squarely before the \r\nSecurity Council, in the signature of the cease-fire agreement concluded in \r\nNew York between hostile brothers, and in the deployment of United Nations \r\nforces to deliver humanitarian assistance. \r\nThus, to the international community, which has now made a massive \r\nresponse with humanitarian assistance, we convey all our gratitude and our \r\nsupport in this urgent task, which includes the restoration of civil peace and \r\nsecurity in Somalia. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n11 \r\n(President Aptidon) \r\nThe nightmarish sight of children breathing their last in their mothers\u0027 \r\nemaciated arms, and those equally unbearable images of women and old men who \r\nno longer have the strength even to walk or to show the least expression in \r\ntheir faces and whose death is already in their eyes, shocked us as they \r\nshocked the whole world. In the name of what might could a whole nation \r\ncondemn itself to self-destruction? The tragedy in Somalia is not inevitable; \r\nthat is to say, human stupidity sometimes causes more devastation than natural \r\ndisasters. While the world has belatedly come to realize the full extent of \r\nwhat is happening today in that country, there is nothing to indicate that \r\nthis tragedy will not claim more victims hundreds of thousands of them in \r\nthe months to come. \r\nSomalia as we knew it no longer exists. In the absence of national \r\ngovernment and central authority, the nation has been plunged into total \r\nanarchy. Indeed, it has returned to a state of veritable barbarism. \r\nThe differences involved have nothing to do with ideology or politics. \r\nIt is simply sheer, blind obsession with power. We clearly see the result of \r\nthe tenacity of the oppressive, tyrannical warlords and clans who have reduced \r\na whole country to rubble. \r\nSomalia, which has never in its history known such a famine or such a \r\ndisaster, needs all of us to save it from this apocalypse that has descended \r\non its people, victims of the folly and narrow-minded egotism of men. A whole \r\ncountry has been razed, reduced to rubble, by war, drought and famine. It is \r\na wasteland ruled by armed gangs of bandits and looters. Peath, human misery \r\nand abject poverty are rampant. \r\nProviding humanitarian assistance under such conditions of warfare is \r\nextremely dangerous. In Somalia\u0027s neighbouring countries, including Pjibouti\u003c \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n12 \r\n(President Aptidon) \r\nthe Somali refugees are either in urban centres, straining already-limited and \r\nunderdeveloped resources, or in camps that are dangerously crowded, facing \r\nshortages of food and medical supplies. \r\nNobody can say with certainty how many people have already died, but at \r\nleast 1.5 million people, one-third of the population, are threatened with \r\nstarvation, children, women and old people being especially vulnerable. I can \r\nonly echo the desperation of a Red Cross official in Baidoa who said, \"We are \r\nin the middle of the tunnel, and we can\u0027t see the light yet.\" \r\nOur hearts go out to the personnel of the international humanitarian \r\norganizations who, despite the dangers, care for, feed and save the lives of \r\nthe innocent victims of this senseless fratricide. \r\nThe question before us today is not only how to save lives through the \r\ndelivery of sufficient food to end the famine or how to stop the senseless \r\nfighting. Rather, in a scenario like that of Somalia, the question is what \r\nthe United Nations, together with the international community, can devise \r\ncollectively to reorganize a new nation of Somalia. Let us make a commitment \r\ntoday that we are bound together by the purposes and principles enshrined in \r\nthe Charter not to let any country simply vanish from our midst! \r\nThere is another persistent crisis which continues to shock us all, \r\nnamely, the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The entire world is horrified \r\nat the war being waged in that very young republic. For several months now, \r\nthe country has been facing armed aggression from outside. The efforts made \r\nto date by the international community to halt the aggression by Serbia and \r\nMontenegro by political and economic means and to settle this crisis \r\npeacefully have been in vain. It is, on the contrary, becoming more and more \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n13-15 \r\n(President Aptidon) \r\nevident that the Serbian authorities are using this conflict to carry out a \r\npolicy of \"ethnic cleansing\". \r\nIf peace is to prevail in that region, all the provisions of the \r\nagreement reached at the London Conference must be implemented immediately. \r\nAnd if hostilities still continue, we call on the international community to \r\nimplement all the provisions of the Security Council resolutions concerning \r\nrecourse to all necessary measures, including military force, to come to the \r\naid of that martyred country. \r\nPjibouti is addressing the Organization today at a time when it is in the \r\nprocess of overcoming a war that has been imposed upon it. It will succeed, \r\nthanks to the unfailing attachment of Pjiboutians to their homeland and their \r\nwill to live together in peace; thanks to the support of fraternal and \r\nfriendly countries, and thanks, lastly, to the continued assistance of the \r\nUnited Nations in defence of our right to sovereignty, independence and peace. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n16 \r\n(President Aptidon) \r\nSince its accession to independence, on 27 June 1977, the Republic \r\nof Djibouti has had to face not only complex problems of economic and \r\nsocial development, but also and above all - the negative impact on its \r\nprecarious socio-economic infrastructure of the constant, destabilizing \r\nwars in the region. \r\nDevastation is never confined to the geographical area of one \r\ncountry or one subregion; it extends across frontiers and endangers the \r\nstability of neighbouring countries, whose populations are, in most cases, \r\nof the same origin. \r\nThis is precisely what is happening in Pjibouti, whose population is \r\nincreasing daily as a result of the continual influx of men, women and \r\nchildren with no alternative but to abandon their country for a more \r\nhospitable environment. For many months now Pjibouti has been playing \r\nhost to an alarming number of refugees and displaced persons. I therefore \r\nfeel compelled to look to the future needs of our State, which cannot \r\nindefinitely share its meagre resources without risking to the adverse \r\nreactions of the community whose interests it has a duty to safeguard. \r\nWhile we have been struggling through this difficult ordeal the \r\ninternational community, rather than relieving and helping us, has \r\nunfortunately perceived the problem only from the purely humanitarian \r\nstandpoint, thus disregarding the negative consequences for the entire \r\nsocial and economic life of my country. \r\nIn response to the egalitarian ideas we have been hearing for many \r\nyears, which originate from beyond our frontiers, my Government has been \r\nconstantly engaged in examining all possibilities which might lead to the \r\nrestoration of peace. It has also pursued a process leading to the \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n17 \r\n(President Aptidon) \r\nestablishment of new institutions, which were put to the judgement of the \r\nvoters at the beginning of this month. \r\nThe response of the people was astonishingly clear. The vote was \r\npreceded by a law instituting a general amnesty relating to events during \r\nthe period characterized by the de facto partition, brought about on the \r\ninitiative of a negligible portion of the population. They had \r\nconsiderable foreign reinforcements, who came from not very far away, and \r\nwhose motives, as well as the origin of the resources they received, were \r\nnot hard to ascertain. \r\nSome may consider that this is only a phase, despite the \r\nintroduction of a multiparty system and the fixing of dates for the people \r\nto choose their representatives at all levels of political life. I \r\nbelieve that I have reason to hope that, with the understanding of \r\nfriendly countries, the support of international organizations, the good \r\nwill of our people and the help of the Almighty, our nation can look to a \r\nfuture full of possibilities and with renewed hope. \r\nThe serious recent events in South Africa in particular, the \r\nBoipatong massacre on 17 June 1992 and more recently the killing of 28 \r\ndemonstrators show the extent to which violence is still the order of \r\nthe day. The refusal of the South African authorities to control that \r\nviolence is casting a shadow over the progress made in South Africa\u0027s \r\npolitical life and is disrupting the process of peaceful change which the \r\nmajority of the South African people so earnestly desire. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n18-20 \r\n(President Aptidon) \r\nThere is no alternative to negotiations for peaceful change in South \r\nAfrica. To this end, the international community will have to continue to \r\nput pressure on the authorities in Pretoria to take the energetic measures \r\nrequired to contain once and for all the forces opposed to the elimination \r\nof apartheid. To do this, they must create a climate of security \r\nconducive to the resumption of dialogue for the emergence of a united, \r\ndemocratic and non-racial South Africa. \r\nWe welcome the deployment of United Nations observers, who I hope \r\nwill help to avoid further massacres and to relaunch a constructive \r\ndialogue between the Government and the majority of the South African \r\npopulation. \r\nAll of our attention has been focused on the initiatives and efforts \r\nunder way in Washington to promote a credible peace that will lead to a \r\njust and comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli crisis. In welcoming \r\nthose developments, Pjibouti pays tribute to the Government of the United \r\nStates of America and to all those contributing to the establishment of a \r\njust and lasting peace in that part of the Middle East. \r\nNevertheless, the following are essential conditions for peaceful \r\ncoexistence among the peoples of the region; the self-determination of the \r\nPalestinian people; a total freeze on settlements; the abandonment of all \r\nrepressive policies and practices against the population of the occupied \r\nterritories; and the withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied \r\nsince June 1967, including East Jerusalem. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n21 \r\n(President Aptidon) \r\nLike all nations of the world, the Arabs want peace. They have \r\ndemonstrated this desire and proved it time and again through a series of \r\ngoodwill gestures and indeed through substantial major compromises in the \r\ncurrent negotiating framework. This wisdom and this openness of mind have not \r\nto date been reciprocated by compatible language. What the Arabs are calling \r\nfor is comprehensive and genuine talks that fully and seriously address the \r\nkey issues of peace, land and security. Let us see if Israel will start once \r\nand for all to negotiate in good faith. Let us see if it will move in tandem \r\nwith the propitious international political climate. By continually demanding \r\nmore security and more concessions while the status quo over territory and \r\npeace persists, Israel is simply squandering a precious moment. It is high \r\ntime that reason prevailed over age-old hatred, acrimony, injustice and \r\nobstinacy. \r\nIn his annual report on the work of the Organization, the economic \r\nsituation in the world in general and, in particular, the constant \r\ndeterioration of the economies of most of the developing countries, the \r\nSecretary-General amply illustrates the bleak economic situation that exists \r\nin most of the world. Although the responsibility for solving economic \r\nproblems at the national level rests in the first place with the countries \r\nconcerned, no national effort, however forceful it may be, can be viably \r\nsustained unless it is undertaken within the framework of a responsibility \r\nshared with the international community and, even more important, unless it is \r\nbacked by appropriate arrangements, a favourable environment and effective \r\ninternational assistance. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n22 \r\n(President Aptidon) \r\nThe task facing the Africans is complex and of considerable scope. It \r\nwill call for great efforts, indeed sacrifices, on our part. In this respect \r\nthe new programme for the development of Africa in the 1990s, which is a \r\ncontract between Africa and its international partners, merits the support of \r\nthe international community. \r\nI cannot disregard the fact that the impressive changes we have mentioned \r\nhave taken place against a background of rising levels of poverty among vast \r\nsectors of the world\u0027s population. Redefining international cooperation for \r\ndevelopment must conseguently be the new priority of the multilateral \r\nprogramme. It is thus essential to define a broader approach to this \r\ncooperation, one which pays particular attention to the developing countries \r\nin general, and to the least developed countries in particular, with a view to \r\nachieving sustainable development. \r\nThe adoption of the Rio Peclaration, Agenda 21 and the other agreements \r\nreached at the historic Rio Conference demonstrates that the international \r\ncommunity is prepared to work in partnership for the protection of the \r\nenvironment and the introduction of a development taking into account the \r\neconomic equilibrium of all. The \"Spirit of Rio\" has engendered great hopes \r\nfor the one billion human beings living in extreme deprivation. Now \r\neverything depends on the follow-up and implementation of the programmes \r\nagreed. \r\nThe new mechanisms and practical measures to be negotiated during this \r\nsession of the General Assembly ought, in our view, to permit access by the \r\ndeveloping countries to technology and additional financial resources. We \r\nexpress the hope that the pledges to finance the objectives of Agenda 21 will \r\nbe commensurate with the task; the credibility of the international community \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n23-25 \r\n(President Aptidon) \r\nis at stake. The new commission on sustainable development, soon to be \r\nestablished, will have to provide the necessary infusion of energy and \r\ninstitute bold policies that will enable us to face the attendant challenges. \r\nIn conclusion, we in the Republic of Pjibouti are confidently awaiting \r\nthe day when all the peoples of the Horn of Africa will have overcome the \r\nspectre of famine and poverty and will live in peace and prosperity. \r\nThe PRESIPENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe President of the Republic of Djibouti for the statement he has just made. \r\nEl Hadj Hassan Gouled Aptidon. President of the Republic of Djibouti, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n26 \r\nADDRESS BY MS. ROH TAB WOO, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Korea. \r\nMr. Roh Tae Woo. President of the Republic of Korea, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\nThe PRESIDENT On behalf of the General Assembly I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic of Korea, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Roh Tae Woo, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\nPresident ROH (spoke in Korean; English text furnished by the \r\ndelegation): I should like to extend my congratulations to you. Sir, on your \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh \r\nsession. I am confident that under your able leadership the Assembly will be \r\nhighly productive. I pay my respects also to the Secretary-General for his \r\ndedicated efforts to promote world peace - the primary objective of this \r\nbody. His experience and sagacity have so strengthened the Organization that \r\nit has been able to meet effectively the new and varied challenges of this \r\nrapidly changing world. I take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to \r\nthose nations that became Members of the United Nations since the last session \r\nof the General Assembly. \r\nToday the world is beginning a new chapter in history. As I stand at \r\nthis rostrum for the third time since 1988, I cannot but recall the profound \r\nand comprehensive transformations the world has undergone over the past four \r\nyears. The global confrontation over ideologies is rapidly disappearing as \r\ndictatorial and authoritarian Governments crumble in succession. Instead, we \r\nare witnessing the birth of freedom, equality and respect for human dignity \r\nand individual creativity. This epic transformation is neither a victory for \r\nany one country nor a triumph of any group of nations; it is a victory for all \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n27 \r\n(President Roh) \r\nof us living in this historic era. Peace and prosperity are no longer distant \r\ndreams; they now stand as realistic goals within our reach, for magnificent \r\nand inexorable waves of freedom and openness are sweeping across the world. \r\nHuman endeavour towards peace and prosperity continues today. From \r\nEastern Europe to the Cape of Good Hope, and from the Atlantic Ocean to the \r\nPacific shores, we witness solid progress towards a more harmonious and \r\nprosperous world. Not only have the United States and Russia begun all-out \r\nreductions of nuclear weapons, but regional disputes too are being resolved, \r\none after another. Through the efforts of the United Nations, the 12 years of \r\ninternecine strife in El Salvador have ended, and Cambodia is in the process \r\nof regaining peace and stability. Today United Nations peace-keeping efforts \r\nare becoming more effective everywhere. \r\nHowever, violence and the illegal use of force persist, even in this age \r\nof reconciliation and cooperation. The situation in Iraq, the dispute in \r\nSouth Africa, the famine in Somalia - these and other problems are evidence \r\nthat before we celebrate the arrival of an age of peace we must marshall \r\ngreater efforts to prevent undue suffering and misery. \r\nWatching the tragic bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia, I could not but \r\nfeel that a long and tortuous road remained before we could secure lasting \r\npeace in our world. The Republic of Korea extends encouragement and support \r\nto the United Nations Protection Force for its courageous activities, under \r\nextremely adverse conditions, to maintain peace and provide humanitarian \r\nrelief and assistance in the former Yugoslav region. We also strongly support \r\nthe diplomatic efforts of the United Nations and the European Community \r\ntowards an early resolution of this dispute. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n28 \r\n(President Roh) \r\nWe are well aware of the many invaluable contributions the United Nations \r\nhas made in the fields of peace-keeping, refugee relief and related \r\nhumanitarian causes. I sincerely hope that the tragic situation in that \r\nregion will be resolved quickly and that the role of the United Nations will \r\nbe further strengthened. \r\nToday the world is becoming a larger whole capable of transcending \r\nconfrontations and rivalries. A new world order is emerging on the basis of \r\nlaw and morality rather than in terms of power. The United Nations has worked \r\nfor half a century, and the time is now opportune, to foster harmony and \r\ncooperation between nations. We must seize this moment to forge a new \r\ninternational order so that a permanent peace structure may be secured. The \r\nUnited Nations should play a central role in our efforts to attain this \r\ncherished goal, because this body is the one just arbiter and the forum where \r\ndisputes may be resolved through dialogue and compromise. \r\nSpeaking from this rostrum last year, I emphasized that the United \r\nNations should redouble its efforts to prevent regional disputes and to \r\nstrengthen further the collective security measures to prevent the illegal use \r\nof force. For these reasons I believe that the \"Agenda for Peace\" recently \r\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General is very timely and meaningful in promoting \r\nour common cause. This Agenda is a very forward-looking and substantive \r\nproposition, which will definitely strengthen the role of the United Nations \r\nin all areas of world peace and security, including preventive diplomacy, \r\npeacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-building. I sincerely hope that the \r\nmembers of this body at the General Assembly during the course of this \r\nsession and in related organs - will seriously consider the proposals \r\ncontained in the Agenda so that consensus may emerge within the international \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n29-30 \r\n(President Roh) \r\ncommunity. The Republic of Korea will faithfully and actively particip-.ce in \r\nall United Nations endeavours to maintain world peace and security and to \r\nsafeguard the future of mankind. \r\nA new international order demands a new concept of international \r\nsecurity. The era in which security was based on military power and on \r\nweapons of mass destruction has passed. Recently the United States and Russia \r\nagreed to destroy all ground-launched ballistic missiles within the next 10 \r\nyears and to reduce drastically the number of nuclear warheads. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n31 \r\n(President Roh) \r\nI wholeheartedly welcome this decision and hope that it will serve as the \r\nimpetus for accelerated reduction of nuclear arsenals throughout the world. \r\nToday one of the most destabilizing trends in the field of international \r\nsecurity is the rapid spread of nuclear and sophisticated conventional weapons \r\nto existing areas of dispute and potential regions of conflict. \r\nMy Government places great importance on the nuclear non-proliferation \r\nTreaty and fully endorses the strengthening of the proposed nuclear safeguard \r\nmeasures by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Furthermore, we will \r\nwholeheartedly support the extension of the Treaty in 1995. \r\nMy Government welcomes the draft Convention on the prohibition of \r\nchemical weapons, which the Geneva Conference on Disarmament successfully \r\nnegotiated. I hope Member States will unanimously approve this important \r\ntreaty at this session; my Government will accede to the Convention without \r\ndelay. \r\nAs the Secretary-General pointed out in his report, we face a number of \r\ncritical challenges, such as the eradication of starvation and world poverty, \r\nthe plight of refugees, respect for human rights and the protection of the \r\nenvironment. \r\nEmancipation from the yoke of poverty and underdevelopment is an urgent \r\nissue that we must resolve for the lasting peace and prosperity of mankind. \r\nWe can speak of peace and prosperity only after we successfully eliminate such \r\nfundamental threats to human life as poverty, hunger, disease and \r\nunderdevelopment. To the starved and wretched, justice sounds hollow. To the \r\nsick and disaffected, peace is meaningless. \r\nJust as ardent aspirations to freedom and prosperity ended the cold war, \r\nwe must now combine our efforts to eradicate poverty and underdevelopment. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n32 \r\n(President Roh) \r\nToday, although the East-West confrontation has ended, the gap between \r\nNorth and South is widening by the day. What is most needed to mitigate this \r\ndisparity is a concerted effort between the advanced and developing \r\ncountries. For their part, developing countries should concentrate greater \r\nefforts on economic development and the improvement of their standards of \r\nliving. In efforts to eliminate poverty from underdeveloped regions and to \r\nimprove living standards there, advanced countries should provide succour in \r\nthe forms of economic aid, investment and the transfer of technology on an \r\nactive and continuing basis. \r\nWe can surmount these challenges if we all agree that there is but one \r\nworld community, of which all of us are a part. \r\nThe Korean people inherited generations of chronic poverty. What little \r\nremained on their land was reduced to ashes in the course of the Korean War, \r\nthe most violent conflagration of the post-war period. Rising from the \r\ndestruction of war, we have built within a generation an economy that ranks \r\namong the dozen largest trading nations in the world. Our country is not \r\nendowed with rich natural resources, and we have carried a heavy defence \r\nburden. We stand prepared to share this experience with the developing world \r\nand those countries under fundamental reforms. \r\nWe distinctly remember the miseries of poverty and underdevelopment and \r\nthe generous assistance and cooperation we received from advanced countries. \r\nWe will act as a bridge between North and South by sharing information and \r\nknow-how and by promoting exchange and cooperation. Korea will actively \r\nparticipate in, and make contributions commensurate with its ability to, the \r\neffective resolution of the North-South problem. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n33 \r\n(President Roh) \r\nThe natural environment is not ours to abuse. It not only represents our \r\npast, but also foreshadows our future. The United Nations Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development last June will be recognized as a new beginning in \r\nthe preservation of our environment. Having reconfirmed the fact that our \r\nPlanet Earth is the very source of life not only for our generation but for \r\nposterity as well, the world community agreed on a plan of action to protect \r\nour environment at the global level. \r\nI sincerely hope that all countries will take the necessary steps \r\ndomestically and cooperate in implementing measures internationally in the \r\nspirit of the Rio Declaration and the Rio Conference. \r\nEnvironmental preservation and economic development should no longer be \r\ntreated as mutually exclusive goals, but as complementary objectives. \r\nHowever, it would not be fair to impose unreasonable environmental \r\nrestrictions on those developing countries that began industrialization \r\nbelatedly due to chronic poverty, underdevelopment and the lack of sufficient \r\nresources. A new path toward a century of peace and prosperity should not be \r\ndesigned at the expense of the developing world. \r\nEnvironmental protection has now become a national objective of my \r\ncountry. Last June Korea adopted for the first time a National Charter for \r\nthe Environment, and we set up a special intragovernmental coordinating body \r\nto oversee environmental policy implementation. \r\nThe United Nations is a most effective organization for solving such \r\nglobal issues as environmental protection. Korea will actively participate \r\nand undertake appropriate roles in all United Nations efforts toward this end. \r\nSystematic human-rights violations persist even as the waves of freedom \r\nand the rights of individuals sweep across the world. The violation of \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n34 \r\n(President Roh) \r\nfundamental human rights cannot be justified under any pretext. The \r\nprotection of these rights is our collective responsibility. International \r\nrelief and assistance efforts should be strengthened to protect refugees from \r\nwar and internecine strife as well as from poverty. \r\nThe protection of minorities is a human-rights issue directly linked not \r\nonly to the stability of the countries concerned, but also to world peace. \r\nConsequently, all Member States must observe their obligations faithfully. \r\nThe Republic of Korea extends full support to the 1993 World Conference \r\non Human Rights. I hope it will serve as a momentous occasion for \r\nstrengthening an international system for the protection of human rights. \r\nThe winds of reconciliation and cooperation that swept across the \r\nEurasian continent are now blowing over North-East Asia. I am pleased to \r\nreport that the Republic of Korea and the People\u0027s Republic of China \r\nnormalized relations last month. As a result, the cold-war rigidities that \r\nkept North-East Asia frozen for the past 47 years have finally begun to melt \r\naway. This is a significant step towards alleviating the agony of the tragic \r\nfratricidal war in Korea. The vigorous pursuit of a Northern Policy to bring \r\nlasting peace to the Korean peninsula has returned a favorable response. \r\nPuring the past four and a half years Korea established diplomatic \r\nrelations with 39 countries, for a total of 165 countries. Piplomatic \r\nrelations between Korea and China and my official visit to Beijing next week \r\nare expected to contribute to reduced tensions on the Korean peninsula and to \r\npeace-making efforts in North-East Asia. North-East Asia has thus begun the \r\nmarch towards a new era of lasting peace and common prosperity. \r\nSpeaking to the Assembly from this very rostrum four years ago, I \r\nmentioned the desirability of a consultative conference for peace in \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n35 \r\n(President Roh) \r\nNorth-East Asia. I note that many hurdles still stand in the way of the \r\nrealization of such a proposal. Times are changing, however. Pepending on \r\nour determination, we can turn such ideas into reality. \r\nIn the highly sensitive region of North-East Asia, which has seen five \r\nmajor wars in the past 100 years, efforts to build a structure of lasting \r\npeace are very desirable for both regional stability and world peace. \r\nTherefore, I hope an opportunity for dialogue between all interested parties \r\nwill be found for the purposes of building trust and promoting mutual \r\nunderstanding, confidence and common prosperity. \r\nOnce mutual understanding and a forum of cooperation are established, I \r\nbelieve that we can realistically expect the emergence of a new order of peace \r\nin North-East Asia. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n36 \r\n(President Roh) \r\nTwo years ago dialogue between the Prime Ministers of the two Koreas was \r\ninitiated. Thus far, eight rounds of meetings have been held alternately in \r\nSeoul and Pyongyang, and a number of issues have been discussed. Late last \r\nyear, the two Koreas adopted an \"Agreement on Reconciliation, Non-aggression, \r\nand Exchanges and Cooperation between the South and the North\" and a \"Joint \r\nDeclaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\" Both documents \r\ncame into effect in February of this year. \r\nWe were filled with a sense of anticipation. For an ethnically \r\nhomogeneous people that has spent the past 47 years in confrontation, this was \r\na dramatic achievement. However, we have yet to see the implementation of the \r\nspecific measures agreed upon by the two sides. The reality on the Korean \r\nPeninsula is that humanitarian projects, including the exchange of visits by \r\nseparated family members, remain unrealized. The terms of the \"Joint \r\nDeclaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\" called for the \r\ntwo Koreas to conduct mutual nuclear inspections by last June. But this \r\nmeasure also has yet to be carried out. \r\nI must point out that mutual nuclear inspections are the most serious \r\nobstacle on the path towards further progress in inter-Korean relations. \r\nNorth Korea\u0027s suspected nuclear development is casting dark clouds over the \r\nfuture of the Korean Peninsula. It is becoming a new factor threatening peace \r\nin North-East Asia and the world at large. \r\nAs members are well aware, reconciliation, cooperation, openness and the \r\ncreation of a new order of peace are clearly the current global trends. I \r\nsincerely hope that North Korea will be able to improve its relations with \r\nother countries. Participation in all regional cooperative bodies and a \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n37 \r\n(President Roh) \r\npartnership with their southern brethren towards a new order of peace and \r\ncommon prosperity are what all my countrymen wish for North Korea. \r\nWhere there is suspicion, however, there can hardly be true friendship. \r\nAs a Member of the United Nations, North Korea is responsible for allaying all \r\nsuspicions surrounding its nuclear development and thereby being accepted by \r\nthe community of nations. At this very hour some 1.7 million heavily armed \r\nsoldiers stand alert along a line dividing the Korean Peninsula. I find it \r\ndifficult to explain why brothers should aim rifles at each other day and \r\nnight in an atmosphere of anxiety and tension. But I have faith faith that \r\nour people will be reunited. \r\nThe 47 painful years we have lived apart is but a brief moment for a \r\npeople that has lived together as one nation for over five millennia. We will \r\nnot be impetuous, nor will we be frustrated. With patience, we will continue \r\nto foster dialogue, exchange, and cooperation with North Korea. On our own, \r\nwe can and will open a wide avenue of exchange and join hands in cooperation. \r\nAnd in the near future we should recover mutual trust on the basis of our \r\ncommon heritage and achieve the historic task of peaceful reunification. \r\nThe Korean people is confident that it has transformed yesterday\u0027s \r\ndespair into tomorrow\u0027s hope. In this endeavour we acknowledge the friendly \r\nsupport and cooperation offered by the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity, for which we shall be forever grateful. If Korea has achieved any \r\nmiracle in recent years, that miracle belongs not only to the Korean people, \r\nbut also to the community of nations represented in this Hall. This \r\nexperience has nurtured our confidence that we can meet the challenges ahead. \r\nThe task now before the Korean people is peaceful national unification. \r\nRecent history dictates that freedom and independence await the subjugated and \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n38-40 \r\n(President Roh) \r\nthat reunification awaits the divided. Only when the last scar of the cold \r\nwar that which divides the Korean peninsula - disappears from the map will \r\nthe world be able to close the historic chapter of the cold-war era. \r\nLast year I concluded my address with the following commitment: \r\n\"Henceforth, the Republic of Korea will play a leading role in building a \r\nworld that will be a blessing to our posterity a world that will be \r\nfreer, safer and happier; above all, a world of peace.\" (A/46/PV.6. \r\npp. 39-40) \r\nToday I reconfirm my resolve. Just as the divided Korean Peninsula was a \r\nfocal point of tension and confrontation in North-East Asia, a unified Korea \r\nwill serve as a fountainhead of peace and prosperity for that region. \r\nToday we have a most propitious opportunity to realize the founding \r\nideals of the United Nations envisaged half a century ago. What is needed is \r\na united will to cooperate and make the necessary sacrifices. This is \r\nposterity\u0027s demand upon our generation and history\u0027s command to our era. To \r\nbuild a more peaceful and prosperous twenty-first century is to realize the \r\nideals of the United Nations and the security and well-being of all mankind. \r\nAs I leave this rostrum, I foresee that a reunified Korea will usher in a \r\npeaceful and prosperous twenty-first century and that, when the first Head of \r\nState of a unified Korea finally stands before the General Assembly, its \r\nmembers will join as one with the Korean people in applauding that momentous \r\noccasion. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe President of the Republic of Korea for the important statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\nMr. Roh Tae Woo. President of the Republic of Korea, was escorfd fro\"1 \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n41 \r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued) \r\nGENERAL DEBATE \r\nThe PRESIPENT: I should like to remind representatives that, in \r\naccordance with the decision taken by the General Assembly at its 3rd plenary \r\nmeeting, the list of speakers will be closed tomorrow at 6 p.m. \r\nMr. HURP (United Kingdom): I am privileged to speak this morning on \r\nbehalf of the European Community and its 12 member States. It is a pleasure \r\nto do so under your guidance, Mr. President under the guidance of a fellow \r\nEuropean Foreign Minister whose country has made such great progress in recent \r\nyears and whose foreign affairs, under your leadership, have also made a very \r\nsubstantial step forward. \r\nIt is also a pleasure to speak in the presence of the Secretary-General. \r\nI do not wish to heap compliments upon you at this stage, \r\nMr. Secretary-General, but I hope that the contents of what I have to say and \r\nwhat we offer you in terms of support for your practical policies you will \r\naccept as an adequate compliment. \r\nAs my colleagues from other regions of the world have no doubt noticed, \r\nwe in the European Community are conducting a lively discussion on how to \r\nachieve the ever closer union to which we are all committed. I am not going \r\nto speak about that subject today because I want to speak about Europe and the \r\nwider world, but I do want to emphasize on behalf of us all that so far from \r\nturning away from that wider world, we in Europe are increasingly active in \r\nit. And I want to make it clear that the European Community and its member \r\nStates are determined to build up the place and the role of the Community and \r\nits 12 member States in world affairs. We intend to work together for the \r\nbetter world order in which we all believe and we intend to carry that work \r\nforward with greater impetus and greater effectiveness. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Hurd. United Kingdom) \r\nTwo years ago, when I first came to speak at the Assembly, the world was \r\ncelebrating the end of the cold war, the beginnings of freedom. Everyone was \r\noptimistic, because everything had changed - it appeared for the better \r\nsince I had first attended a session of the General Assembly, at the height of \r\nthe cold war back in the 1950s. \r\nAt the end of 1992 we see things differently. The world after the cold \r\nwar is a better place, but it is also less stable. We have seen both a \r\ndemocratic spring and a demagogic spring, an outpouring of hope but also, in \r\nplaces, an outpouring of hate. \r\nInternational order is threatened in the short term by the unleashing of \r\nextreme nationalism, of challenges to the rule of law. In the medium term we \r\nhave to reinforce the system of collective security based on the United \r\nNations. Respect for good government, respect for human rights must move to \r\nthe centre of our stage. In the long term we face the threat to international \r\npeace and security posed by poverty, posed by environmental degradation. We \r\ncannot afford to postpone action on the longer-term problems while we wrestle \r\nwith the short-term problems. I should to look, very briefly, at each of \r\nthese three challenges in turn. \r\nThe short term the immediate. Nationalism, of course, is not a fault \r\nin itself; it is a natural instinct of man in society. We see its benign \r\nmanifestations in many places in the former Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, \r\nthough even there, there are problems. Yugoslavia is the worst example of the \r\nbitterness of nationalism producing intolerable results. That is why both \r\nEurope and the United Nations have to work strenuously for peace with justice, \r\nfor the relief of suffering in those tortured lands of the former Yugoslavia. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n43 \r\n(Mr. Hurd. United Kingdom) \r\nSince last autumn the European Community and the United Nations have \r\nindeed been working closely, the United Nations leading on peace-keeping and \r\nthe European Community on peace making through Lord Carrington\u0027s Peace \r\nConference. This cooperation has helped stop the killing in, for example, the \r\nSerb Krajina in Croatia, where the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) \r\nand the European Community monitoring mission have achieved a good result. \r\nAs conflict escalated, particularly in Bosnia, the United Nations and the \r\nEuropean Community decided with wide international support to harness their \r\nefforts more closely together through the process launched by the London \r\nConference last month. The International Conference on the former Yugoslavia \r\nis now working in Geneva under the co-chairmanship of Mr. Cyrus Vance for the \r\nUnited Nations and Lord Owen for the European Community. It is powered by the \r\ndetermination of the international community to bring an end to the violence \r\nin the former Yugoslavia. \r\nThe Conference has two main objectives: humanitarian and political; to \r\nalleviate the suffering of the victims of the conflict and to bring that \r\nconflict permanently to an end by negotiating a political settlement. This \r\nis, of course, difficult work, requiring a deep understanding of the problems, \r\nrequiring the respect and cooperation of the parties, requiring the unstinting \r\nsupport and, when necessary, the mobilizing of pressures from the \r\ninternational community. \r\nIn this context, I believe that Prime Minister Panic\u0027s new approach shows \r\ngreat courage and I salute that courage. It offers a different way forward \r\nwhich we believe should be supported. But while the killing and suffering \r\ncontinue, as they did yesterday and as they do today, we cannot relax our \r\nefforts. We have to measure progress by deeds and not promises. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n44 \r\n(Mr. Hurd. United Kingdom) \r\nWe have to continue to deal with other problems left by the rolling back \r\nof the cold war. In Cambodia, we must not let the peace process drift. The \r\nKhmer Rouge have not joined phase II of the cease-fire arrangements. They are \r\ndelaying the implementation of the comprehensive political settlement. On the \r\npositive side, the military deployment of the United Nations TransitionaL \r\nAuthority in Cambodia (UNTAC) is now fully complete and the civilian component \r\nis beginning to take control of the key ministries. We have to make every \r\neffort to hold to the timetable for elections next April. \r\nSome States still show a willingness to challenge the rule of \r\ninternational law and, indeed, to resort to terrorism. The invasion of Kuwait \r\nby Iraq was the first test of the post-cold-war era, and the liberation of \r\nKuwait was one of this Organization\u0027s great successes. Unfortunately, we have \r\nto note that Saddam Hussein continues to defy the United Nations, that his \r\nGovernment is failing to meet Iraq\u0027s obligations under Security Council \r\nresolution 687 (1991), that he continues to repress his own population, \r\nparticularly in northern and in southern Iraq. That is why pressure must \r\nand will - continue until he implements the resolutions of the United Nations \r\nin full. The message has to be that all States must comply with Security \r\nCouncil resolutions. We still wait for Libya to implement Security Council \r\nresolution 731 (1992). \r\nThose are just some of the short-term challenges that we have to meet. \r\nThere are long-running problems which we must not forget, and one of \r\nparticular concern to the European Community is Cyprus. This year, \r\nMr. Secretary-General, you have made an energetic effort. It is not yet \r\ndecisively successful. You are renewing the effort next month. There is a \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n45 \r\n(Mr. Hurd. United Kingdom) \r\nneed for fresh impetus, it seems to us, on the key issues of territory and \r\ndisplaced persons. There must be a willingness to negotiate on all sides; \r\notherwise there will be no lasting settlement. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n46 \r\n(Mr. Hurd. United Kingaâ¢*) \r\nYou have our full support, Mr. Secretary-General, as you renew your \r\neffort. Not only does it deserve to succeed, but it is in the crucial \r\ninterest of Europe and the international community that it should succeed. \r\nIn the medium term we have to build a stronger system of collective \r\nsecurity. And here, everybody looks, rightly, to the United Nations. But as \r\nthe Secretary-General has pointed out, we are in danger of loading the \r\nOrganization with too heavy a burden: a burden of intervention and a burden, \r\nin effect, of partial administration. \r\n\"Something must be done.\" That phrase is on many lips; it is the impulse \r\nwhich we all feel as we read about or as we watch on television screens some \r\nfresh evidence of man\u0027s inhumanity to man. But we have to realize where that \r\nimpulse, that phrase \"Something must be done\", leads us. We should not wander \r\ndown that road without serious thought because it would involve a \r\nrestructuring of armed forces so that they could take a full part in the \r\ngrowing number of peace-making and peace-keeping exercises of the United \r\nNations. It would mean a massive increase in the funds which the United \r\nNations and its humanitarian agencies would require from Member States from \r\nus: from all of us in regular contributions and in aid, in times when many \r\nMember States face severe budgetary problems. These are just two of the \r\nimplications of the course on which the world is beginning to propel the \r\nUnited Nations because \"something must be done\". \r\nHow do we prevent these demands from getting out of hand? The best way, \r\nof course, is to prevent those conflicts which give rise to the demands - in \r\nshort, diplomacy: preventive diplomacy. I know that diplomacy is \r\nunfashionable in the world of the kneejerk reaction and the dogmatic \r\nsound-bite on television. Diplomacy lacks news value; it lacks glamour; it \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Hurd. United Kingdom) \r\ninvolves compromise; it takes time; it is easy to mock. It just happens to be \r\nindispensable. \r\nThat is true, to take one example of many one could take, of conflicts in \r\nthe Middle East. There the parties have from time to time tried to cut the \r\nknot; they have tried to resolve their disputes by force, but in vain. This \r\nis a critical moment in the Arab-Israel peace process, which we in Europe \r\nstrongly support. We in the Community know that all concerned must seize this \r\nopportunity; the tide must be caught. The negotiation of a final settlement \r\nbased on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) will take time \r\nyet, will take hard work yet. What is important in the immediate future is \r\nfor all parties to work towards visible progress, building step on agreed step. \r\nDiplomacy is partly a matter of institutions and strengthening them. \r\nSpeaking as a European on behalf of Europeans, I hope that one day the \r\nConference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) will be effective in \r\nthe prevention of conflict throughout Europe. With the adoption of the \r\nHelsinki document the CSCE has begun to give itself the tools to tackle \r\nproblems by conciliation before they slide into violence, and to manage crises \r\nonce they develop. That document shows that the CSCE is a regional \r\narrangement according to Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. That \r\nmakes a crucial link between European and global security. \r\nBut of course the United Nations is the centre of this thinking, and \r\nreform of the United Nations is crucial to its performance. Early this year \r\nthe Secretary-General made a determined start on administrative reform. I \r\nbelieve that will turn out to be a decisive step. This is being followed up \r\nboth in the Secretariat and in the vast superstructure of intergovernmental \r\nbodies which have grown up over the past 40 years in the economic, social and \r\nother fields. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n48 \r\n(Mr. Hurd. United Kingdom) \r\nWe welcome the work of the General Assembly to which I know that you \r\npersonally, Mr. President, are devoted to rationalize its agenda. All this \r\nis welcome; all this has to be carried forward. \r\nA summit of the Security Council met last January at the initiative of my \r\nPrime Minister to consider next steps. We asked the Secretary-General to \r\nprepare a report on the ways in which the United Nations could help tackle the \r\nnew challenges of which I have spoken. On 17 June, you, \r\nMr. Secretary-General, published your ideas on preventive diplomacy, \r\npeace-keeping, peace-making and what you called peace-building. This \r\ncollection of ideas is going to turn out to be a turning-point in the history \r\nof our Organization. You tried to address a need which is not some distance \r\nahead, but which is here and now. I believe you are in the extraordinary \r\nposition of someone who is being asked to manufacture a vehicle while he is \r\ndriving that vehicle on the road. It is not easy, but it is necessary. \r\nThe general debate should be a genuine debate on the ideas advanced in \r\nthe report. All United Nations bodies, notably the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly, should follow up swiftly in the light of the debate. \r\nPreventive diplomacy I have already mentioned. Obviously, it is \r\nquicker. It is more helpful to peoples about to be embroiled in conflict than \r\neven the most successful peace-keeping operation which comes after the \r\noutbreak of violence. It is also less costly in terms of lives and in terms \r\nof cash. The Secretary-General should be ready to make full use of his powers \r\nunder Article 99 of the Charter to draw the attention of the Security Council \r\nto any matter which in his opinion may threaten international peace and \r\nsecurity. Greater use is already being made of fact-finding missions; we \r\nwould like to encourage this trend. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n49 \r\n(Mr. Hurd. United Kingdom) \r\nPreventive deployment of troops might take place to deter aggression or \r\nconflict between States, possibly involving deployment to only one side of an \r\ninternational border. Of course there may be difficulties about timing the \r\ndispatch of such a force in a given crisis, but we believe this is essentially \r\na sound idea that could be applied case by case. \r\nI warmly welcome what President Bush said yesterday on his initiatives to \r\nstrengthen the peace-keeping work of the United Nations. \r\nIn the European Community we want to follow up the idea of preventive \r\ndeployment in the event of an internal crisis, where the Government concerned \r\nrequests help, with humanitarian assistance or conciliation. No two cases \r\nwould be the same. There would need to be careful discussions with \r\nGovernments and the parties concerned before the international community could \r\nusefully deploy monitors. \r\nRecognizing that, the European Community and its member States have \r\nalready decided in principle to send civilian monitoring missions to States \r\nwhich want them where this could avert a crisis and possible bloodshed. In \r\nSouth Africa, for example, with the agreement of all the parties, established \r\nduring a recent visit of the troika, the United Nations will be joined by the \r\nEuropean Community and by the Commonwealth in sending observers to reinforce \r\nthe national peace accords there. \r\nOf course, part of this prevention of conflict must involve prevention of \r\nthe proliferation of armaments, especially weapons of mass destruction. We \r\nwelcome the agreement on a global convention on chemical weapons. This is a \r\nstep towards a safer and more secure world. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n50 \r\n(Mr. Hurd. United Kinga*,,) \r\nWe recognize that peace-making brings pain to some. Bringing pressure -\r\neven peaceful pressure, say, of sanctions on warring parties, means \r\nsacrifice for innocent third parties. We understand the economic difficulties \r\noften caused to third parties by the imposition of sanctions under \r\nChapter VII. Countries which need balance-of-payments help, countries which \r\nmay also at the same time be carrying out prudent adjustment programmes, can \r\nbe badly affected. The international financial organizations are in the best \r\nposition to assess and then take into account the effects of United Nations \r\nmandatory sanctions when the;_\u0027 design support packages for the countries \r\nconcerned. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. Hurd. United Kingdom) \r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s report contains a number of proposals for Member \r\nStates to earmark forces for enforcement action and for peace-keeping. All 12 \r\nStates members of the European Community have responded to his guestionnaire \r\non this and all Members of the United Nations should, we believe, keep it \r\nunder regular review. \r\nThen there is money, financial contributions. The Secretary-General \r\nrightly, continuously underlines the importance of financial as well as \r\nmilitary contributions to peace-keeping. The figures speak for themselves. \r\nThe 12 States members of the European Community are supposed, under the rules, \r\nto contribute one third of the cost of peace-keeping operations financed \r\nthrough assessed contributions. At the end of August we, the Twelve, had in \r\nfact given not 33 per cent but over 40 per cent of total contributions \r\nactually collected so far for the various new operations launched or expanded \r\nsince the end of the last session of the General Assembly. Those European \r\nCommunity member States, of which mine is one, joining in the new operation in \r\nBosnia, will bear all their own costs. We believe we are doing our bit so far \r\nas this is concerned in Europe, and look to others to do the same. The \r\nSecretary-General is quite right: the financial problems of the United \r\nNations must not be allowed to slide, must not be allowed to fester. We \r\nsupport the proposed peace-keeping reserve fund, subject to negotiation on the \r\ndetail, and we believe the General Assembly must follow this up. \r\nThe role of the United Nations does not stop once a conflict is over. \r\nThat is why the Secretary-General\u0027s study entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\" \r\nrightly looks at how we can build peace after a conflict. Take El Salvador, \r\nan illustration that has already been used by His Excellency the President of \r\nthe Republic of Korea. The promotion of free elections and democratic \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. Hurd. United Kingdom) \r\ninstitutions is a key part of such peace-building, and so, to take a very \r\ndifferent example, is de-mining. Is it not a sad commentary on the state of \r\nthe world that the removal of mines in the aftermath of conflict has to be \r\nhigh on our agenda, whether in Cambodia, northern Somalia or Angola? \r\nBut we of the European Community welcome the emphasis the \r\nSecretary-General gives to human rights, democracy and development. Perhaps \r\nduring the cold war some of us tended to concentrate exclusively, or almost \r\nexclusively, on abuses of human rights in the Soviet bloc. Elsewhere there \r\nwas lip-service when there should have been action. But all people are \r\nentitled to full human rights. We want the World Conference on Human Rights \r\nat Vienna in June 1993 to take real steps in that direction. \r\nWe warmly welcome as part of that effort what we see as the tide of \r\npolitical reform now flowing in the continent of Africa. We are helping to \r\npromote good government and sound human rights and electoral practices. Both \r\nat the national and the Community level, we have already shown that we are \r\nready to meet requests for help in election monitoring, notably in Ethiopia, \r\nthe Congo and, later this year, in Kenya and Ghana, and also in the \r\ninter-parliamentary work going on in Namibia. \r\nBut of course in the longer term collective security can be undermined by \r\ndeeper economic and social forces, such as poverty and environmental \r\ndegradation. Relief must be followed by recovery or else the countries \r\nafflicted will be overwhelmed by despair. Is that not what we see in \r\nSomalia? This appalling tragedy is a warning of what could happen elsewhere, \r\nof what could become widespread, because Somalia is just the most extreme form \r\nof a problem now affecting large parts of sub-Saharan Africa. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Hurd. United Kingdom) \r\nI say this all the more strongly because at the beginning of this month I \r\nled a European Community Troika visit to Mogadishu. What we saw there is what \r\nmany colleagues have spoken of, and I echo their voices. We saw the \r\ndisintegration of a society. We marked the absence of all legitimate \r\nauthority. We witnessed the collapse of a State and of all services connected \r\nwith a State. Instead of order, instead of law, teenage gangsters roam the \r\nstreets, toting their Kalashnikovs and offering protection at a price. \r\nInstead of a distribution system, whether capitalist or socialist, there is \r\nblackmail and looting. \r\nAgainst that background we saw the new humanitarian relief arrangements \r\nbeing put into place by Mr. Eliasson and many other devoted people. We saw \r\nhow the United Nations has to work naturally, intimately and without rivalry \r\nwith non-governmental organizations. We saw how urgently the Somalis need a \r\nreconstruction of civil authority. We fully support Ambassador Sahnoun\u0027s \r\nefforts in Mogadishu, in Somalia. He is an outstanding civil servant on \r\nbehalf of us all. Last month the Security Council rightly voted to strengthen \r\nthe United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) so that its security units \r\nwill be better able to distribute aid. Among the States Members of the \r\nEuropean Community, Belgium, with the support of all of us, plans a \r\nsubstantial contribution to that security. \r\nOf course not all disasters are man-made, though it looks as if an \r\nincreasing proportion are. There is the drought in the Horn of Africa and \r\nsouthern Africa, which will require a major international effort over the \r\ncoming year. \r\nFor the first time, over the last two or three years, the environment has \r\nbecome a priority for all countries. I have to say that the road from Rio de \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n54 \r\n(Mr. Hurd. United Kingdo^) \r\nJaneiro may be harder than to the road to it. The United Nations Conference \r\non Environment and Development in Rio attracted the world\u0027s leaders, the \r\nworld\u0027s media and the world\u0027s imagination. But sustainable development has to \r\nstay at the top of the international agenda. That is why, immediately after \r\nhis return from Rio de Janeiro, Prime Minister Major proposed an eight-point \r\nfollow-up plan picking up the key elements agreed upon at Rio de Janeiro. \r\nThat initiative was broadly endorsed at our European Council in Lisbon and at \r\nthe Economic Summit in Munich. \r\nThe Sustainable Development Commission, which is to be set up by the \r\nGeneral Assembly, will be crucial to the follow-up. The Assembly must create \r\nan effective instrument to ensure that the impetus built up at Rio is not \r\ndissipated and lost. \r\nTo conclude, for the medium and long term we need to turn hope into \r\nreality. In the short term, time after time, in place after place, we must \r\nbring hope to what is already a grim reality. The legacy of the cold war is a \r\nmixed one. In facing it, the international community must be realistic, \r\nbecause history cannot be denied, cannot be uprooted. The solving of problems \r\nwhich have their roots deep in the centuries is a slow, frustrating business. \r\nAfter the brief gleam of optimism in 1989 and 1990, when all seemed easy, \r\nwe are now more realistic. Progress towards a more decent, orderly world will \r\nnever be without effort. Our best hope is to take two steps forward for each \r\nstep back. Even that imperfect progress will require the rapid strengthening \r\nof our institutions and in particular of the family of institutions called the \r\nUnited Nations - not essentially by more conferences and more speeches, but by \r\nthe practical effort which the United Nations, under the guidance of the \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n55 \r\n(Mr. Hurd. United Kingdom) \r\nSecretary-General, mounts today in Somalia, Yugoslavia, Cambodia and countless \r\nother troubled places. \r\nThe trucks of our agencies, painted white, and the blue berets of our \r\nUnited Nations contingents do not bring magic or instant happiness, but they \r\nbring a glimmer of hope where till then there may have been despair. In the \r\neffort of bringing hope, in the short term and in the longer term, the \r\nEuropean Community and its member States will take a persistent, energetic and \r\nworthy part. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n56 \r\nPROGRAMME OF WORK \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I should like to inform members of the possible \r\nscenario for agenda item 8, to be considered this evening immediately \r\nfollowing the general debate. The general debate is expected to end at around \r\n8.30 this evening that is, if the length of speeches is what delegations \r\nhave indicated to the Secretariat. \r\nImmediately afterwards we shall take up agenda item 8. The draft \r\nresolution will be introduced, and we shall proceed to hear the speakers \r\ninscribed on the list. Thus far, three speakers have inscribed their names on \r\nthe list of speakers, in addition to the member State introducing the draft \r\nresolution. \r\nThe Assembly can then act on the draft resolution, hearing explanations \r\nof vote, if any, before and after the vote. \r\nI hope this outline is helpful for delegations to plan their work. \r\nAGENPA ITEM 9 (continued) \r\nGENERAL DEBATE \r\nMr. KOZYREV (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian): \r\nFirst, I wish to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to this \r\nimportant post. The fact that a representative of Bulgaria has assumed this \r\npost at the head of the Assembly at precisely this time is a sign of the \r\nimportance that the world community attaches to the peaceful democratic \r\nrevolution in Eastern Europe. And we are proud that our countries, linked by \r\nties of traditional friendship, are treading this path together. \r\nThe democratic movement has prevailed in the cold war. For the first \r\ntime in history unprecedented opportunities have opened up for the \r\nimplementation of the principles proclaimed by the United Nations. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Kozyrev. Russian \r\nFederation) \r\nThe post-confrontational and post-communist world is not a \r\npax Sovietica. a pax Americana, a pax Islamica or a pax Christiana, nor is it \r\na monopolistic system of any kind, but rather the multipolar unity in \r\ndiversity that the United Nations has symbolized from the very outset. \r\nFor the present, such a world is only a possibility yet to be realized \r\nthrough our joint efforts. Realism leaves no room for euphoria. A difficult \r\nperiod of transition lies ahead. But realism compels us to reject any \r\nalternative to the democratic choice. \r\nRussia, which has rejected communism, has, perhaps more than any other \r\ncountry, learned from its own experience that there can be no alternative to \r\ndemocratic development; our country voted for democracy during the first \r\nnation-wide presidential election in its history, and defended it at the \r\nbarricades around the Moscow White House. Neither the President, nor the \r\nGovernment, nor the majority of Parliament, nor the country at large will turn \r\naside from the path of reform, no matter how difficult it may prove. \r\nTotalitarianism robbed Russia both of its unique identity and of the \r\npossibility of self-fulfilment in its relations with other nations. Through \r\nits self-imposed isolation, the richest country of Eurasia became the sick man \r\nof Europe and Asia. In contrast, only an open society and a policy of \r\nopenness will enable Russia to find and play to the fullest extent its unique \r\nand historic role. \r\nThis policy has its roots in an age-old Russian idea. Back in the \r\nthirteenth century Saint Alexander Nevsky, one of the founders and defenders \r\nof the Russian State, said: \"God is to be found not in power but in truth\". \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr. Kozvrev. Russian \r\nFederation) \r\nToday this is the policy of the true national interests of the Russian \r\nState as a normal rather than an aggressive great Power, as one that \r\nrecognizes and shoulders its responsibilities as a permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\nThe basic elements of this policy are as follows: partnership and \r\nalliance for democracy and a dynamic market economy with countries that share \r\nthese values; good-neighbourly relations with all neighbouring States; \r\ncomprehensive strengthening of the Commonwealth of Independent States, \r\nstrategic partnership with Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and all \r\nother countries created in the place of the former Soviet Union; and \r\nsolidarity and mutually advantageous cooperation with all the members of the \r\nworld community. \r\nRussia intends to act in support of United Nations efforts to address \r\nthe twofold task of the democratization of societies and the renewal of \r\ninternational relations. This is consonant with the concluding statement of \r\nthe summit meeting of the Security Council, with Secretary-General \r\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali\u0027s report \"An Agenda for Peace\" and with the first \r\nstatements already made from this rostrum. Russia is ready to give practical \r\nsupport to the proposals made yesterday by George Bush, President of the \r\nUnited States. \r\nFirst of all, it is necessary to extinguish armed conflicts. \r\nThe Russian Federation will increase its efforts to eliminate conflicts \r\ninherited from the past in the territory of the former USSR, bearing in mind \r\nthe special interest and responsibility of Russia in strengthening the \r\ncivilized principles of the United Nations and the Conference on Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE) in this part of the world. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n59 \r\n(Mr. Kozyrev. Russian \r\nFederation) \r\nRussia supports the participation of the new independent States in these \r\ntwo organizations and other international forums. We welcome their \r\nrepresentatives in this Hall. \r\nWe categorically reject imperialistic ambitions, diktat and violence, \r\nboth in the area of the former USSR and in other parts of the world. Should \r\npolitical means fail, force can and should be used to separate the warring \r\nsides, to protect human rights and humanitarian missions and to restore peace \r\nin strict conformity with the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nAgreements for cease-fires and for the establishment of peace-keeping \r\nforces, concluded with Russian participation, are already in effect in \r\nOssetia, the Dniester region and Abkhazia, where Russian soldiers are carrying \r\nout their peace-keeping duties. Together with CSCE, we will strive to end the \r\nwar and bring peace to Karabakh and to secure the integrity of Tajikistan and \r\nbring national reconciliation to that country. In all those efforts we count \r\non continued active cooperation with the United Nations. \r\nWe support efforts aimed at forcing Iraq to implement the decisions of \r\nthe United Nations and ensuring at the same time the territorial integrity and \r\nthe peaceful nature of that State. For that purpose, Russia has sent two \r\nnaval vessels to the Persian Gulf. \r\nWe also must ensure that the demands of the Security Council are \r\ncomplied with by all the Yugoslav sides and must enable them to maintain \r\ncontact with the United Nations. A Russian infantry battalion is serving \r\nhonourably with the United Nations forces in Yugoslavia. \r\nI agree with the preceding speaker concerning the need to support the \r\nefforts of Mr. Panic for the practical implementation of the intentions he has \r\ndeclared. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n60 \r\n(Mr. Kozyrev. Russian \r\nFederation) \r\nRussia will continue to cooperate actively with the other permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council and with all the parties concerned in \r\norder to seize the opportunity for a peaceful settlement in the Middle \r\nEast, Cambodia, Angola and other areas of conflict. \r\nWe have no doubt that it is the task of the United Nations to combat \r\nviolence with force based on law, with its potential for enforcing peace. \r\nThe Blue Helmets should take action in response even when they are fired \r\nupon. \r\nIt is time to strengthen the capacity of the Security Council to \r\ntake swift and decisive action in humanitarian emergency situations \r\narising from mass violations of human rights and inter-ethnic clashes, \r\nincluding those within national borders. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n61 \r\n(Mr. Kozyrev. \r\nRussian Federation) \r\nIt is important to strengthen the preventive component of United Nations \r\nactivities. This includes the establishment of hot lines to United Nations \r\nHeadquarters, the submission of intelligence information to the \r\nSecretary-General and the further development of fact-finding. \r\nEnhanced United Nations efforts to safeguard human rights and the rights \r\nof national minorities are also a priority. In the past it was chiefly the \r\nvictims of totalitarian regimes and ideologies who needed protection. What is \r\nincreasingly needed now is to combat the aggressive nationalism that is \r\nemerging as the new global threat. \r\nThe replacement of ideological intolerance with national and religious \r\nintolerance would threaten the world which is increasingly becoming one \r\nworld - with rifts just as serious and with national, regional and global \r\ncatastrophes. Democratic Russia categorically rejects any form of chauvinism, \r\nbe it Russophobia or anti-Semitism. \r\nWe feel special concern at the growing discriminatory practices against \r\nRussians, Ukrainians, Jews and all other non-indigenous nationalities in some \r\nof the new States that have emerged in the territory of the former USSR, \r\nparticularly in Estonia and Latvia. A situation in which 42 per cent of the \r\npopulation of the Estonian Republic are disenfranchised is totally \r\ninconsistent with international law. \r\nWe have raised and will continue to raise these issues in the United \r\nNations and other forums. We have the right to do so, among other reasons, \r\nbecause the countries in question won their independence, to a substantial \r\nextent, through the triumph of the democrats in Russia. The practices I have \r\nreferred to can in no way be justified by invoking the problem, inherited from \r\nthe USSR, of the withdrawal of armed forces from the Baltic States. We are \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Kozvrev. \r\nRussian Federation) \r\nalready working together to resolve that problem, and we intend to resolve it \r\nas soon as possible; however, due regard must also be given to the rights of \r\nthose who are in military uniform. \r\nIt would be appropriate to give thought to a joint interpretation of the \r\ninternational trusteeship system set forth in the Charter of the United \r\nNations, particularly since one of its basic objectives is and I guote the \r\nCharter - \"To encourage respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms \r\nfor all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\". That \r\nsystem has brought many nations to independence. Today national minorities \r\ndesperately need the trusteeship of the world community. \r\nThe fate of former Soviet servicemen taken prisoner in Afghanistan \r\nremains one of the gravest humanitarian problems. We call upon the General \r\nAssembly to proclaim its support for the urgent resolution of this problem. \r\nThe rejection of the game of \"nuclear roulette\" in favour of cooperation \r\nin the interests of strategic stability for all and with the participation of \r\nall States concerned is reflected in the agreements on further drastic cuts in \r\nstrategic offensive arms and on a global defense system reached in Washington \r\nby the Presidents of Russia and the United States of America. \r\nReaffirming its commitments under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons, the Russian Federation invites all countries that have not \r\nyet done so to join the Treaty as non-nuclear-weapon States. It is our belief \r\nthat all the former Republics of the USSR, including Ukraine, Belarus and \r\nKazakhstan, will do so. This step should be taken as soon as possible, since \r\nthe entry into force of the treaty on strategic offensive arms depends on it. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. Kozyrev. \r\nRussian Federation) \r\nWe expect that a sense of high responsibility and a readiness to reach \r\ncompromise solutions will prevail in the decisive phase of the approval of the \r\nConvention on the banning of chemical weapons. \r\nRussia is in favour of control, including control through the United \r\nNations, over international arms transfers, especially over offensive and \r\nhighly destructive weapons. The approach taken with respect to regimes that \r\ndisregard the standards of international law should be particularly strict. \r\nThere is an obvious need for the development of concrete \r\nmilitary-industry conversion programmes, not only through the efforts of \r\nindividual countries but also through the combined action of the international \r\ncommunity. The United Nations and its specialized agencies could play a \r\npioneering role in this endeavour. In the long run, real disarmament and the \r\nconversion of military industries to peaceful production will make it possible \r\nto release additional resources for the needs of development. \r\nBut development cannot be achieved without ensuring full political and \r\neconomic rights and freedoms, without releasing human creative potential in a \r\nmarket environment. Russia has learned this from its own experience. \r\nFor a successful solution of the problems of development, it is extremely \r\nimportant to strengthen the interaction between the United Nations and the \r\nBretton Woods institutions. Herein lies the key to the harmonization of the \r\nworld community\u0027s efforts in such areas as support of macroeconomic reforms \r\nand technical assistance and the provision of help in resolving social \r\nproblems. Both developing and developed countries will benefit from this. \r\nThe United Nations Conference at Rio de Janeiro reinforced the consensus \r\non the need to integrate development policies and environmental protection. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n64 \r\n(Mr. Kozyrev, \r\nRussian Federation) \r\nThe task of renewing international relations calls for the \r\nrationalization of the United Nations itself and of the United Nations \r\nsystem. The desire of some States to play a more active role in the United \r\nNations is guite natural. The Charter provides ample scope for this. In \r\nparticular, the Charter permits the Security Council to establish auxiliary \r\nbodies in which many States would participate. We are convinced that the \r\nUnited Nations and other international organizations will play a growing role \r\nin regulating international relations. \r\nIn conclusion, I should like to address you, Mr. Secretary-General. \r\nRussia supports your efforts to bring about the settlement of international \r\ncrises, to improve the efficiency of the United Nations Secretariat and the \r\ncoordination of the activities of all international agencies. \r\nSupport of the United Nations presupposes the fulfilment of financial \r\nobligations to the Organization. Despite its economic difficulties, in the \r\nperiod from September of this year to March 1993 Russia will pay $130 million \r\nas partial payment of our arrears to the United Nations and an additional \r\n$30 million to other agencies. \r\nYour recent statements in Moscow, Mr. Secretary-General, have confirmed \r\nthe similarity of our vision of the great future of the United Nations. \r\nMr. VAN DEN BROEK (Netherlands): It is a great pleasure to see you, \r\nSir, a youthful symbol of a profoundly changed Bulgaria, in the Chair. I know \r\nand trust that you will steer us skilfully through this session of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n65 \r\n(Mr. Van Den Broek. \r\nNetherlands) \r\nThe cold war is over. The world has heaved a sigh of relief. The United \r\nNations now has an unprecedented opportunity to carry out the mandate \r\ncontained in the Charter, even though politically the world has grown much \r\nmore complex and complicated. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n66 \r\n(Mr. Van Den Broek. Netherlands \r\nOf course, no change has occurred in the underlying problems of a \r\nlong-term nature. The threat to the very survival of the human race posed by \r\nthe deterioration of the environment, overpopulation and poverty was there \r\nalready, even though awareness of the threat has increased quite dramatically \r\nin recent years. It is a threat that will be with us for years to come, and \r\nit will grow more and more acute if there is a lack of appropriate action. \r\nOne course of action is for the United Nations to put its house in order in \r\nthese areas through a restructuring of its economic and social sectors and \r\nthrough a meaningful follow-up to the Rio Summit. The United Nations \r\nConference on Environment and Development has put sustainable development high \r\non our agenda, and there it should remain. The establishment of solid \r\nmachinery, including a high-level commission on sustainable development, will, \r\nwe hope, be one of the major achievements of this session of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\nBut in the political field, on which I will concentrate today, there has \r\nbeen a qualitative change. We are still thankful for the end of the cold war, \r\nwith its menace of massive nuclear destruction, but in its stead a plethora of \r\nconflicts and potential conflicts has sprung up with a vehemence which nobody \r\nhad foreseen. Each of these conflicts has its own characteristics, and each \r\nhas to be dealt with in a particular fashion. The United Nations is, on the \r\nwhole, the right organization to deal with these emergencies, whether directly \r\nor indirectly. In order to carry out that task it will need to possess all \r\nthe means necessary for what I would call a flexible response, ranging from \r\npreventive diplomacy to repressive action. A number of these requirements \r\nhave been set out by the Secretary-General in his impressive report \"An Agenda \r\nfor Peace\" (A/47/277). This Agenda will form the basis for our discussions on \r\nthe subject. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n67 \r\n(Mr. Van Den Broek. Netherlands) \r\nWhere and when should the United Nations intervene? Clearly, it cannot \r\nbe everything to everyone. In order not to overstretch, it inevitably has to \r\napply a certain degree of self-restraint. Moreover, the membership of our \r\nOrganization consists of sovereign States, and respect for their sovereignty \r\nis one of its principles. Nevertheless, it would be too easy to make \r\nnon-intervention and deference to domestic jurisdiction the leading \r\nguideline. Moreover, it would not work. Frontiers have become porous and \r\ninformation world-wide. Atrocities and aggression committed within a country \r\ncannot pass unnoticed, and once noticed will not be tolerated by world \r\nopinion. For the United Nations to stand idly by would be detrimental to its \r\nnew-found status, which we all have an interest in protecting. \r\nWith the end of the cold war, regional conflicts have proliferated, but \r\nat the same time the possibility of doing something about them has increased. \r\nThis is both because the Security Council is not paralyzed by vetoes any more \r\nand because the risk of a conflict\u0027s degenerating into global war has \r\nsubsided. This makes it possible to contemplate international action where it \r\nwould have been impossible or unfeasible before. With the possiblity of \r\naction comes the notion that lack of action is a form of action as well, \r\nrequiring a decision, just as a decision is necessary to act. A decision not \r\nto act in the case of flagrant violations of human rights or the rights of \r\nminorities, or in the case of large-scale human suffering, will now set a \r\nprecedent, just as planned intervention does. It is no longer possible just \r\nto look the other way. \r\nPerhaps somewhat belatedly, this has been recognized in the case of \r\nSomalia. The international community could not afford to condone the \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n68 \r\n(Mr. Van Pen Broek. Netherlands) \r\nintolerable situation in that country any longer. The short-term task \r\nconsists of assuring the survival of the people. In the somewhat longer term, \r\nthe whole country will have to be reconstructed. The United Nations has a \r\nmajor role to play on both counts. \r\nThe United Nations has also become involved in former Yugoslavia. Here \r\nwe see massive aggression, destruction, impending starvation and even the \r\nestablishment of concentration camps, all with a view to making large areas \r\n\"ethnically clean\", as the ugly saying goes. Nationalism and irredentism have \r\nrun wild and are threatening neighbouring States as well. Everyone knows who \r\nis mainly responsible. \r\nConcerted action can and should be taken. Effective delegation and \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations is crucial. \r\nJoint United Nations-European Community efforts to help solve the Yugoslav \r\ncrisis are a clear example. Interaction between the United Nations and the \r\nEuropean Community, in their co-chairmanship of the London Conference, has \r\nunderlined the potential for coordination between the United Nations and \r\nregional organizations in the field of preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and \r\npeacemaking. It is not only Chapter VIII that is being put into practice \r\nhere. Even more important is the linkage between the quest for a diplomatic \r\nsolution on the one hand and the possibility of enforcement action by the \r\nUnited Nations on the other hand, in the event of non-compliance by the \r\nparties concerned. The recognition of territorial and ethnical faits \r\naccomplis would be an insult to the Charter. To my mind, the Yugoslav crisis \r\nis a compelling case for action. More could be done, and I hope that more \r\nwill be done soon. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n69 \r\n(Mr. Van Pen Broek. Netherlands) \r\nThe Netherlands fully supports the Secretary-General\u0027s view that: \r\n\"regional arrangements or agencies in many cases possess a potential that \r\nshould be utilized in serving... preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping, \r\npeacemaking and post-conflict peace-building\". (A/47/277, para. 64) \r\nIndeed, I am convinced that regional organizations increasingly have to take \r\nup responsibilities with regard to regional peace and security. The role of \r\nthe Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in the Yugoslav \r\ncrisis is a clear example of this trend. So are others, such as the \r\nOrganization of American States and the Organization of African Unity. \r\nThe process of delegation and cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe various regional organizations does not have to stop at this level. \r\nOrganizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Western \r\nEuropean Union have specific operational contributions to make as well. Both \r\norganizations recently announced at the CSCE Summit in Helsinki their decision \r\nto make resources available to support the CSCE or the United Nations in \r\ncarrying out peace-keeping activities. The CSCE can also call on others, such \r\nas the Commonwealth of Independent States, to contribute to peace-keeping \r\nactivities. This development is a concrete example of an evolving network of \r\norganizations which we refer to as \u0027interlocking institutions\u0027. \r\nThe Security Council is rightly the focus of world attention nowadays. \r\nThis new interest has provided the discussion on the Council\u0027s membership with \r\na fresh impetus. In the last chapter of \"An Agenda for Peace\", the \r\nSecretary-General observes that agreement among the permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council must have the deeper support of the other members of the \r\nCouncil. It should also have the wider support of the membership of the \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n70 \r\n(Mr. Van Pen Broek. NetherlanH | | | | | \r\nAssembly if the Council\u0027s decisions are to be effective and are to endure. \r\nThis raises the question of the relationship between members and non-members \r\nof the Council and of the Council\u0027s composition. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n71 \r\n(Mr. Van Pen Broek. Netherlands) \r\nThe achievements of the Council in terms of effective leadership and \r\ndecision-making, particularly during the last two years, need not be \r\nelaborated upon. Supporters of the maintenance of its current composition can \r\nhence, with some justification, argue that there is no need to change a \r\nwinning team, or, to use a colloquial expression of our host country, \"If it \r\nain\u0027t broke, don\u0027t fix it.\" The critics of the status quo argue that the \r\nCouncil\u0027s present composition is a reflection of the balance of power of days \r\ngone by. This leaves us with a dilemma because both sides have a point. \r\nImportant changes have taken place in international relations. The \r\nnumber of Member States has increased enormously since the enlargement of the \r\nCouncil in 1963. The Charter specifies in Article 24 that the Council acts on \r\nbehalf of all Members. This implies that the Council should be, to a certain \r\ndegree, representative of the international community. Were the Council to \r\nbecome an exclusive club disconnected from the United Nations membership as a \r\nwhole, this might tend to undermine its authority and diminish its \r\neffectiveness. So what are we to do when faced with the question of the \r\nCouncil\u0027s effectiveness on the one hand and its representativeness on the \r\nother? \r\nA possible solution to this question might be found in severing the \r\nautomatic link between permanent membership of the Council and the right of \r\nveto. A number of concrete options can be considered in this respect. One \r\nwould be to consider the adoption of a double veto: two negative votes by \r\npermanent members being required to hold up a decision instead of one. \r\nAnother suggestion put forward is the creation of semi-permanent membership of \r\nthe Security Council. This membership would apply to a certain category of \r\nimportant States for a period of, say, five to seven years, possibly without \r\nthe right of veto. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n72 \r\n(Mr. Van Pen Broek. Netherlands) \r\nTo determine which countries would be eligible for this type of \r\nmembership, it seems that two criteria are relevant: both the political \r\nweight of the country concerned and the degree to which its membership would \r\ncontribute to a more eguitable geographical distribution of the Council\u0027s \r\ncomposition. In view of the Council\u0027s responsibility for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, it would appear to me that those two \r\nelements should be carefully balanced against each other. \r\nClearly, the creation of semi-permanent membership is only one of a \r\nnumber of options that can be considered. A broad international discussion on \r\nthis issue has already begun. The basis of this discussion should be in the \r\nagreement that any change envisaged should first and foremost seek to ensure \r\nthe continued effectiveness of the Council for the United Nations as a whole. \r\nIn recent years we have seen some very encouraging developments all over \r\nthe world in the field of human rights. Many nations have taken the difficult \r\nbut promising road to democracy. Their success will undoubtedly contribute to \r\na further spread of respect for fundamental human rights. It was our hope \r\nthat the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights, to be held next year \r\nin Vienna, would contribute to this positive trend. The Netherlands welcomed \r\nthe process from the start. We are, for instance, a major donor to the fund \r\nthat allows delegations from the least privileged countries to participate. \r\nHowever, the preparatory process has thus far failed to produce an agenda \r\nfor the Conference. The Chairperson of the preparatory process rightly \r\nconcluded that most States will be disappointed at the lack of results. The \r\nNetherlands shares this feeling of disappointment. Curiously enough, the \r\nresults thus far have lagged behind the constructive and relatively harmonious \r\nresults achieved in other United Nations forums such as the United Nations \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n73 \r\n(Mr. Van Den Broek. Netherlands) \r\nCommission on Human Rights. The perfect example of this was the recent \r\nunanimity displayed by this Commission when it met for its first emergency \r\nsession, which was devoted to the human rights situation in former \r\nYugoslavia. In view of this sharp contrast, one cannot but wonder what causes \r\nthe World Conference process to be so polarized and, subsequently, what \r\npositive contribution the Conference can make in these circumstances to the \r\nUnited Nations work in the field of human rights. \r\nMeanwhile, human rights are still, in practice, being violated in \r\nnumerous countries. I have already mentioned former Yugoslavia, where outrage \r\nat the massive violation of human rights and international humanitarian law in \r\nBosnia-Herzegovina, confirmed by the report of the United Nations Special \r\nRapporteur, Mr. Mazowiecki, has increased the calls for measures against the \r\nperpetrators of such acts. Personal accountability under international law \r\nand the appropriate machinery to deal with the individuals responsible are \r\nstill lacking, but Security Council resolution 771 (1992) paves the way for \r\nfollow-up action by Member States. My country favours the establishment of \r\nmachinery for the systematic gathering of data concerning criminal acts \r\ncommitted by individuals with regard to the Geneva conventions and the human \r\nrights conventions. I believe that such an approach can be expected to have a \r\ndeterrent effect. \r\nFor the longer term. Member States could consider the establishment of an \r\ninternational criminal court, taking into account work already undertaken by, \r\namong others, the United Nations International Law Commission. Although it is \r\nclear that the establishment of such a court will not come about overnight, it \r\nis certainly worthy of careful consideration by the \u0027Assembly. The Assembly \r\nmight give the International Law Commission the task of developing this idea \r\nfurther. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n74-75 \r\n(Mr. Van Den Broek. Netherlands) \r\nThe United Nations involvement in conflict settlement has led to a wide \r\narray of peace-keeping operations. The number of Blue-Beret military has \r\nreached an all-time record. The Netherlands contributes sizeably to United \r\nNations operations worldwide and will continue to do so: taking into account \r\nother obligations and practical limitations, all units of the Netherlands \r\narmed forces can in principle be assigned for peace-keeping. We support the \r\nconcept of making available contingents to the United Nations at short notice \r\nand have included this in our standing offer to the Organization. \r\nThe Preamble to the Charter clearly states the United Nations \r\ndetermination to promote social progress and better standards of living. Many \r\ncountries are confronted with a lack of social stability, mass migration, \r\nrapid urbanization and other problems which affect the fabric of society. The \r\nworld summit for social development, in principle to be held in 1995, will \r\nallow us to address these issues at the highest levels of government. This \r\nwill help the United Nations to carry out the tasks inherent in its important \r\nsocial mandate. \r\nThe Security Council has rightly qualified the proliferation of all \r\nweapons of mass destruction as a threat to international peace and security. \r\nThis underlines the importance of combating their proliferation. Arms control \r\nand regional, political and security arrangements have their role to play. So \r\nhave export control regimes. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n76 \r\n(Mr. Van Den Broek. \r\nNetherlands) \r\nThe Netherlands attaches particular value to the United Nations Register \r\nof Conventional Arms, and it is heartening to see before the Assembly the \r\nconcrete elaboration of technical procedures for this Register, agreed to by \r\nconsensus by a representative panel of governmental experts. The time has \r\ncome to render the Register fully operational starting next spring, in 1993, \r\nand we look forward to a universal implementation of its provisions. \r\nA convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons will be put before \r\nthis session of the Assembly. It is a magnificent achievement for all the \r\nmembers of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament. My country hopes that many \r\ncountries will be amongst the original signatories of the chemical weapons \r\nconvention, so that it can be strictly implemented. The Netherlands, as host \r\ncountry for the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), \r\nhas a special role to play, and we shall endeavour to live up to expectations. \r\nWith the chemical weapons convention achieved, it becomes all the more \r\nimportant to reflect upon ways and means to strengthen the biological weapons \r\nConvention, in particular in matters of verification. Securing compliance \r\nwith the Convention could involve more than just voluntary measures, important \r\nthough these may be. \r\nAs to the third category of weapons of mass destruction, we have to bear \r\nin mind that the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is up for extension in \r\n1995. My country strongly advocates such an extension for an indefinite \r\nperiod. We welcome the progress made recently to strengthen the \r\nnon-proliferation regime by both further accessions to the NPT and \r\nmodifications of the Tlatelolco Treaty, opening the way for the entry into \r\nforce of that Treaty for all Latin American and Caribbean States. \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n77 \r\n(Mr. Van Den Broek. \r\nNetherlands) \r\nWe are are placing ever-increasing demands upon the United Nations. \r\nCambodia, Yugoslavia and Somalia are only a few examples of its increasing \r\ninvolvement. This is not without severe financial consequences for the \r\nOrganization. Quite frankly, I find it hard to believe that, at a time when \r\nue expect the United Nations to play its demanding role, an important number \r\nof Member States is not paying its contributions on time and in full. We \r\nbelieve it is essential for the proper functioning of the United Nations that \r\nall Member States, not just 5 per cent, meet the condition of full and timely \r\npayment. The United Nations will not be able to fulfil its task unless \r\neveryone picks up his share of the bill. Financial discipline on the part of \r\nMember States is as important as it is on the part of the Organization. \r\nWith regard to peace-keeping especially, if regional responsibility for \r\nthe maintenance of peace and security is to acquire real meaning, we would \r\nstrongly favour Member States looking at the concept of burden-sharing on a \r\nregional basis. In any case, the present short-term solutions of ad hoc \r\nfinancing are neither satisfactory nor equitable. If we want a healthy United \r\nNations to deal with tomorrow\u0027s problems, this issue needs to be addressed \r\ntoday. It would be an illusion to think that the current stopgaps, creative \r\nas they may be, will eventually suffice. \r\nAs I have already stated, the opportunities for the United Nations to \r\ncarry out its mandate are unprecedented. This is true for a number of \r\nconflicts which until recently seemed intractable. Cambodia is the clearest \r\ncase where a United Nations peace plan is being implemented. Angola is \r\nanother example of what the United Nations can do. The continuing dialogue by \r\nA/47/PV.6 \r\n78 \r\n(Mr. Van Den Broek. \r\nNetherlands) \r\nSouth African parties provide us with a spark hope for the establishment of a \r\nnon-racial democracy. There is an initial involvement on the part of the \r\nUnited Nations. Negotiations within the framework of the Madrid Conference \r\nhave carried the Middle East peace process further after a long period of \r\nstandstill. I hope that in this area, too, the United Nations can at some \r\nstage become closely involved. \r\nMy friend and colleague Douglas Hurd, speaking on behalf of the European \r\nCommunity and its member States, rightly observed that the challenge facing us \r\nin this turbulent time is to reinforce the system of collective security based \r\non the United Nations. As I said earlierf, the United Nations cannot be \r\neverything to everybody. Nevertheless it is clear that, because of the \r\nsuccess our Organization has achieved over the last few years, enormous \r\nexpectations have been raised. It is our duty to see to it that the United \r\nNations is equipped in terms both of personnel and financing to face the tasks \r\nwith which it will of necessity be confronted. \r\nThat brings me, logically and finally, to the Secretary-General. It is a \r\nsource of the greatest satisfaction to me to see Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in \r\nthis august position. His profound international experience, his keen \r\nintelligence and the determination which he has already shown in tackling a \r\nnumber of issues make him very much the right man in the right place. \r\nI wish to assure Mr. Boutros-Ghali of the co-operation of the Kingdom of \r\nthe Netherlands in the discharge of his arduous task. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m. \r\n"
