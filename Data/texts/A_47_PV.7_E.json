FRANJO TUPJMAN, PRESIPENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The Assembly will first hear an address by the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Croatia. \r\nMr. Franio Tudiman. President of the Republic of Croatia, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations the President of the Republic of Croatia, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Franjo Tudjman, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\nPresident TUDJMAN (spoke in Croatian; English text furnished by the \r\ndelegation): It was exactly four months ago that for the first time I had the \r\nhonour of addressing you, the representatives of sovereign States members of \r\nthe global community, in our common House, the General Assembly of the United \r\nNations. Membership in the United Nations is the crowning international \r\nconfirmation of the sovereign statehood of a State, \r\n(sooke in English) \r\nTo the Republic of Croatia it meant the final realization of the just \r\naspiration of the Croatian people to self-determinatioV and freedom, which \r\nthat people although one of the oldest European nations succeeded in \r\nregaining only after nine centuries of life in multinational state communities \r\nin which, to be sure, they preserved their national identity and the identity \r\nof their state but did not enjoy internationally recognized sovereignty. \r\nThe creation of our independent State was the outcome of the \r\nindestructible moral strength of the Croatian people, based on a firm national \r\nawareness that has burned for centuries as an eternal fire in our hearts. A \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n3 \r\n(President Tudiman) \r\nnation may have existed from time immemorial, but if it lacks the moral \r\nstrength and an awareness of its unique individual being, of its nationhood \r\nand statehood, it will disappear from the stage of world history. The \r\nCroatian people yearned for their State and rallied to achieve it. \r\nIn their relatively long history from the seventh century to this very \r\nday the Croatian people have taken pride in authentic testimony in stone and \r\nin the written word to their existence and to their unguenchable yearning for \r\nfreedom and for their own place among the nations of the world. It was in \r\nthat very spirit that the great seventeenth-century Croatian poet \r\nIvan Gundulid wrote in his city of Dubrovnik, that jewel of the heritage of \r\nCroatia and the world which in our time has suffered barbaric destruction \r\nhis ode to freedom, which starts with the following lines: \r\n\"0 liiepa, o draoa. o slatka slobodo,. \r\nPar u kom sva blaga vis\u0027n-ii nam Bog je do ...\" \r\nThose verses express the eternal faith in freedom that has been granted \r\nus as a supreme gift by the Almighty, a gift man has cherished, lived for and \r\ndied for since time immemorial, as an independent, cultured and civilized \r\nbeing not only as an individual, but also as a member of his people and of \r\nmankind as a whole. Just as the individual wants to live as a free, rational \r\nand unique being, a people can be recognized and appreciated only if it is \r\naware of itself and of its uniqueness in the world. \r\nThe Croatian people had their own independent kingdom in the Middle \r\nAges. Today they have again achieved full State sovereignty, demonstrating to \r\nthe world their deep faith in and allegiance to freedom, their respect for \r\njustice, and their wish for peace and the development of their State within \r\nthe international community of peace-loving, equal and independent States. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n4 \r\n(President Tudiman) \r\nWhen it joined the United Nations the Republic of Croatia solemnly \r\ncommitted itself to respect the principles embodied in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and the system of values and undertakings on which the global \r\ncommunity is based. On this occasion, let me once again solemnly reiterate \r\nour profound allegiance to the principles of the United Nations. \r\nWe are faced with the historical responsibility to establish a new \r\ninternational order, an order of eguality and the protection of the rights of \r\nall States and nations, national minorities and individuals. At the same \r\ntime, this poses the challenge of building a world without war, a world with a \r\nhealthy environment, a world of progress for all the inhabitants of the Earth. \r\nFor the first time in the history of mankind, the conditions have been \r\ncreated for achieving those noble goals. After the disintegration of the \r\ncolonial empires following the Second World War, and after the appearance of \r\nnew nations capable of forming States but also of so-called ahistorical \r\nnations on the global scene, we have finally seen the end of division into \r\nblocs and the collapse of numerous despotic regimes throughout the world. \r\nObviously and by no means accidentally the collapse of such regimes has \r\nbeen associated and has coincided with the collapse of some multinational \r\nStates in which nations were held together through repression by totalitarian \r\nregimes or through domination by single nations. \r\nHuman society has entered a period in its historical development of the \r\noverall integration of civilizations, but also of national individualization. \r\nIn other words, the world has become immeasurably interdependent in terms of \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n5 \r\n(President Tudjman) \r\ndevelopment, technology, transport, ecology, culture and the exchange of \r\ninformation, but the number of independent international entities has been \r\nincreasing continuously. Reconciling this contradiction imposes the necessity \r\nto seek mediation, and even the firm involvement of the entire international \r\ncommunity, to resolve outstanding and new local and regional crises. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n6 \r\n(President Tudjman) \r\nOver the past two-year period, in which Croatia gained its sovereignty, \r\nthe United Nations has reaffirmed its fundamental principles and tenets: \r\npeace and democracy as the foundations of international relations. This \r\nOrganization has resolutely and efficiently opposed attempts to resolve \r\ninternational disputes by force or to infringe, through aggressive wars and \r\nthe provocation of regional crises, on the right of nations to \r\nself-determination and on the territorial integrity of sovereign members of \r\nthe international community. The determined military action in the Gulf war \r\nand the peace operations in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Cambodia are \r\neffective proof that the United Nations, with its active role, is becoming \r\nincreasingly capable of countering aggression and of bringing about peace. \r\nHowever, the experience acquired by the United Nations through peacemaking and \r\npeace-keeping operations and in controlling aggression indicates that the \r\nprocess of international agreement and the achievement of consensus in the \r\ninitiation of peace operations is still slow and is not efficient enough. \r\nThe Republic of Croatia welcomes and fully supports the activities so far \r\nundertaken by the United Nations to extinguish crises throughout the world, \r\naware of the fact that a passive attitude or compromise towards the exponents \r\nof aggression and a new deterioration in international relations would be much \r\nmore costly and involve substantially greater loss of human life and \r\nsuffering. Nevertheless, it is the view of the Republic of Croatia that the \r\nfuture international peace-keeping activity of the United Nations will have to \r\nbe expanded to include adequate preventive diplomacy, peacemaking efforts and \r\npost-war confidence building, precisely in order to keep human suffering and \r\nthe danger of the spread of aggression to a minimum. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n7 \r\n(President Tudjman) \r\nMoreover, the Republic of Croatia perceives the need to channel the \r\nimmediate future involvement of the international community, and thereby the \r\nprogrammes of the United Nations, along the following main lines of activity. \r\nFirst, the global economy must pull itself out of the deepening \r\nrecession, and then an accelerated development cycle should be promoted, \r\ninvolving a higher degree of coordination and economic cooperation between the \r\ndeveloped North and the developing countries. Our generation and the global \r\ncommunity would bear a heavy responsibility to posterity if they permitted the \r\nrecently ended opposition of East and West to be replaced by new barriers and \r\na lack of trust between the industrially developed West and North and the \r\nthird world. \r\nSecondly, an equally important task of the United Nations concerns the \r\npersistent and firm promotion of democratic freedoms and human rights \r\nthroughout the world. This is a necessity because economic and overall \r\ndevelopment can no longer even be imagined, much less realized, merely on the \r\nbasis of economic categories and criteria; it can be brought about only with \r\nthe parallel establishment of human rights and a democratic order encompassing \r\npolitical liberties and social rights alike. \r\nIn this respect, Croatia welcomes the decision to convene the World \r\nConference on Human Rights in September next year. Croatia will actively \r\ncontribute to the preparations for this important - I should say \"historic\" \r\nmeeting, first by resolutely strengthening democratic institutions in our own \r\ncountry, which has only recently got rid of its totalitarian regime and alien \r\ndomination. Moreover, within the scope of the Conference on Security and \r\nCo-operation in Europe (CSCE), Croatia has offered to host the CSCE seminar on \r\nminority problems which, we hope, will be held in the historic setting of \r\nBrijuni Island next May. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n8 \r\n(President Tudjman) \r\nThe Republic of Croatia resolutely endorses the conclusions of the Rio \r\nSummit, convinced that sustainable development is the proper answer to the \r\nrequirements of the global community and to the environmental balance of our \r\nplanet. The protection of the environment is an important strategic issue in \r\nCroatia\u0027s long-term development. The Gulf war and the war operations in the \r\nformer Yugoslavia have posed major threats to ecological systems. Because of \r\nthis, the protection of the environment is not only a developmental issue, but \r\nalso a major political and security issue. \r\nLast but not least, the future activity of the international community \r\nand of the United Nations should also be focused on in addition to the \r\neffective prevention of aggression as a means to settle international \r\ndifferences eliminating all sources of crises world-wide in order to \r\nestablish a permanent and just peace. This complex task will involve a \r\npainstaking process of agreement and reconciliation of objectively differing \r\nviews and interests, taking due account of the limited resources of the \r\ninternational community. However, the stakes and anticipated results for the \r\nentire international community are so great and historically far-reaching that \r\nthey deserve every possible effort and the use of all resources in order to \r\nachieve humanity\u0027s supreme goal: permanent peace and general welfare in a \r\nstable international order. \r\nThe role of the United Nations has been, and will remain, irreplaceable \r\nin ensuring the rights of nations to self-determination and the civil and \r\nhuman rights of ethnic communities and minorities. The United Nations can and \r\nmust play an important role in controlling changes in societies that are \r\nridding themselves of totalitarian systems on their way to democratic \r\npolitical and economic transformation. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n9 \r\n(President Tudjman) \r\nIn line with such ideas, Croatia has already enacted - in wartime \r\nconditions, and in spite of the aggression waged by the Yugo-communist army \r\nand Serbia and Montenegro and of the externally incited revolt of part of the \r\nSerbian population in its territory a constitutional law on the protection \r\nof minorities that is more liberal than many similar pieces of legislation \r\nanywhere in the world. Croatia is prepared to contribute actively to the \r\ndevelopment of an international code and standard for the protection of the \r\nrights of ethnic communities and national minorities, to be used as guidelines \r\nin the development of national legislation and rules for the settlement of \r\nfuture controversies. \r\nWe support enhancement of the role of the General Assembly as a global \r\nadvisory parliament and of the Security Council as the body most responsible \r\nfor international peace and security. This implies a higher responsibility \r\nfor the members of the Security Council, and the permanent members in \r\nparticular. We therefore support the initiative to expand the Security \r\nCouncil with new permanent members, because this would reflect the new global \r\nreality and allow for more harmonious regional representation. We also \r\nbelieve that the role of the Economic and Social Council in the solution of \r\nproblems within its sphere of competence should be strengthened. \r\nLet me take this opportunity to stress in particular that Croatia fully \r\nagrees with the statement of the Secretary-General on regional conflicts as o \r\nthreat to global peace and progress, made at the Department of Public \r\nInformation\u0027s Annual Conference for Non-governmental Organizations, on \r\n9 September. The regional conflicts of our time are no longer comparable to \r\nthose of the cold war, when the warring sides represented conflicting \r\nideologies. Present-day regional conflicts are the expression of purely \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n10 \r\n(President Tudjman) \r\nimperialist or conquest-minded policies. They are not only the cause of \r\nterrible tragedy - because of the casualties suffered predominantly by the \r\ncivilian population, the destruction of property and the displacement of \r\npeople from their homes but also a threat to peace in a wider area, and even \r\nglobally. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n11 \r\n(President Tudjman) \r\nAlthough one of the main principles of the United Nations Charter entails \r\nnon-interference in the domestic affairs of sovereign States, many current \r\nconflicts occurring within the borders of particular States have shown that \r\nsuch developments should become the concern of the United Nations when general \r\nhuman principles are violated and international peace is threatened. As the \r\nSecretary-General has stated with a profound feeling of moral responsibility, \r\nit is the duty of the United Nations to support the dignity of human beings \r\nand to ensure the safety of their lives, regardless of the type of conflict, \r\nbe it general, regional or confined to a specific country. \r\nWhen chaos within a State threatens to bring down civilized and \r\ndemocratic order, when tyranny crosses the boundaries set by moral standards \r\naccepted by humankind, and when a regional conflict may jeopardize the \r\nfoundations of international order, peace and security, the United Nations \r\nmust be able to take action. Most States, if not the entire international \r\ncommunity, are also threatened when the existence of a single United Nations \r\nMember is placed in jeopardy. The examples of Cambodia, Somalia and, \r\nunfortunately, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina suffice to confirm the \r\ncorrectness of this view. \r\nLet me remind the Assembly of the contribution of the struggle of the \r\nCroatian people for freedom to the establishment of the rights of small \r\nnations, to the collapse of totalitarian regimes and to a new democratic \r\natmosphere in international relations in central and south-eastern Europe. \r\nThe awakened-national awareness of east and central European nations made the \r\nmajor contribution to the dissolution of the totalitarian communist system. \r\nTheir struggle against communist socialism, particularly in multinational \r\nState communities, was a struggle for national emancipation and for civil \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n12 \r\n(President Tudjman) \r\nrights. Initially it was mistakenly understood, and, in some cases even today \r\nit is mistakenly understood, as retrograde nationalism or autarchic \r\nseparatism, or has simply been put down as ethnic conflict and struggle for \r\npower. \r\nThe processes of regional and worldwide integration on the one hand and \r\nthe disintegration of multinational States on the other are only seemingly at \r\nodds. The newly emerged States in the area of the former Yugoslavia or the \r\nformer Soviet Union do not aspire to autarchy. It is precisely such countries \r\nthat most require purposeful integration and openness to cooperation. \r\nHowever, within the new post-communist democratic atmosphere small nations \r\nwant to preserve their own identity and the right to their own States so that \r\nthey may be subjects, and not objects, within the scope of the epoch-making \r\nchanges taking place in the modern world. \r\nAt the very beginning of the national and political emancipation of the \r\nCroatian people we were aware of the complexities and possible risks \r\nunderlying the collapse of the past regime within a multinational State \r\ncommunity. Therefore, we patiently tried to resolve the crisis of the former \r\nYugoslav federation by political negotiation and by proposing a confederal \r\nagreement in order to avoid war. From the very\" beginning we supported the \r\ninternationalization of the crisis, and by such an approach we have succeeded \r\nin turning international democratic public opinion to our advantage. \r\nToday, having achieved military and moral victory in the war that was \r\nforced upon our country, we are still ready for a political solution of all \r\ninternal and international problems in order that the conditions necessary for \r\npermanent internal and regional stability and cooperation between the newly \r\nemerged States may be created. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n13 \r\n(President Tudjman) \r\nThe recent just struggle of the Croatian and other peoples for their \r\nsovereignty has contributed to the development of a different attitude towards \r\nthe rights of small nations to independence and to their own States. This \r\nunegual struggle has, in fact, affirmed the superiority of the democratically \r\nmanifested right to self-determination of nations over the principle of the \r\nintegrity of existing multinational States, and in this connection it has also \r\nbrought about new changes in international law and international relations. \r\nThe position of small or less developed nations and States within the \r\ninternational order is the key to regional and international stability and \r\ncooperation and to just international relations. Without the confirmation of \r\ntheir right to State individuality the United Nations would now consist of \r\nabout 50, and not 179, Member States. Our recent experience has shown that \r\nstable peace and a firm international order are not possible in the \r\npost-cold-war world without the security and sovereignty of small nations. It \r\nis for these reasons that we believe that the international community is \r\nentitled to interfere in the internal affairs of countries in cases involving \r\nthe control of aggression, humanitarian intervention, the protection of the \r\nrights of individuals and of national minorities and the preservation of the \r\nenvironment, in accordance with the principles of, and through mechanisms \r\nendorsed by, the international community. \r\nAccordingly, we would welcome such a new role for the United Nations, as \r\nwell as for such regional organizations as the Conference on Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE), which would guarantee the protection of the \r\nsecurity of all Member States in a process ranging from peace mediation to the \r\nimposition of peace. Without such a role the United Nations could not handle \r\nsuch crises as the one affecting the former Yugoslavia. The chief \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n14 \r\n(President Tudjman) \r\nresponsibility for international security rests with the Security Council, but \r\nthe regional organizations should assume the main burden of implementing \r\npolicy, based on United Nations principles. For this reason we support the \r\nestablishment of permanent regional military forces capable of rapid peace \r\nmediation and action to prevent conflict or repel aggression. \r\nFurthermore, Croatia firmly supports the Secretary-General\u0027s \"Agenda for \r\nPeace\" and the process of establishing permanent United Nations military \r\nforces. In the post-cold-war world, when regional conflicts present the major \r\nthreat to world security, international peace-keeping and peace-making forces \r\nare emerging as the watershed between chaos and stability. Croatia is ready \r\nto participate in these forces and to help to bring peace to troubled areas \r\naround the world. \r\nHad such mechanisms existed, the disastrous Yugo-communist and \r\nSerbo-Montenegrin aggression against Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina might \r\nhave been averted. This crisis has obviously reaffirmed the egual right of \r\nall nations, particularly young or small nations, to security and has enhanced \r\nthe need to create such mechanisms. \r\nIn view of what I have said, we would support the development of a \r\nregional security system in our area, a system that could also serve as a \r\nmodel for other crisis areas. Because of their geopolitical importance, \r\nethnic mix and painful historical experience, it is precisely the Balkans and \r\nsouth-eastern Europe that would necessarily require the development of such a \r\nmodel of international regional security congruent with the general system of \r\ncommon security in order that the stability of the global order might be \r\nachieved. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n15 \r\n(President Tudjman) \r\nThis implies consideration of all steps to bring about \r\nconfidence-building and mutual guarantees, the establishment and maintenance \r\nof the balance of power and the creation of security zones and protected \r\nareas, along with the adjustment and supervision of defensive and other armed \r\nforces and doctrines. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n16 \r\n(President Tudjman) \r\nIn order to achieve stability in this part of Europe, in which the \r\nprocesses of both stabilization in the Eastern Mediterranean and in \r\nsouth-eastern Europe and the establishment of stable relations among the newly \r\nemerged States are still to be completed, Croatia is prepared to take the \r\ninitiative in convening an international conference of the countries in the \r\narea in order to consider the future model of regional security and \r\ncooperation based on common interests and principles embodied in the United \r\nNations Charter and CSCE documents. \r\nThe Republic of Croatia endorses the coordinated process of regional and \r\ngeneral disarmament and welcomes the results already achieved in \r\nheavy-armament reduction by the big Powers. Croatia is prepared to cooperate \r\nwith other countries in reallocating military expenditures to the \r\nreconstruction of war-ravaged areas and to peacetime development. \r\nThis concerns in particular the new States which reguire international \r\ncooperation in the implementation of their democratic and market reforms in \r\norder to bolster their domestic stability. The role and the responsibility of \r\nthe international community are to be seen in the light of the fact that these \r\nsocieties are not strong enough to be able rapidly to become part of the \r\nintegration processes. Because of this the speedy integration of new States \r\ninto financial and other institutions should be promoted. \r\nWe endorse automatic international intervention and other punitive \r\nmeasures when the territorial integrity of other countries is seriously \r\nthreatened. The United Nations should also envisage a way to prevent the use \r\nof military force against the peaceful expression of political will in the \r\nsolution of domestic political issues. The brutal use of military force \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n17 \r\n(President Tudiman) \r\nagainst one\u0027s own people should not in our time be regarded as merely an \r\ninternal political problem. \r\nWe endorse the establishment of a permanent international court for the \r\npunishment of war crimes and all actions involving the deliberate violation of \r\npeace and international conventions and endangering the lives of the civilian \r\npopulation. \r\nIn support of an open economy and market principles we propose, within \r\nthe scope of international development strategies, identifying ways and means \r\nto favour and facilitate the transfer of technology, knowledge and the \r\nnecessary resources to less developed countries or countries destroyed by \r\nwar. To our mind, it is precisely the United Nations and its agencies that \r\nought to play an important role in this process. The United Nations and its \r\nagencies ought to take the lead in handling the return of refugees and the \r\nreconstruction of their homes, destroyed cultural monuments, industrial plants \r\nand infrastructural facilities processes that are of particular importance \r\nto our country. \r\nThe earliest solution of all issues regarding the succession of States in \r\naccordance with international law is of the highest importance for Croatia and \r\nother States that have emerged in the area of the former Yugoslavia and the \r\nformer Soviet Union. In supporting the solution of these issues we are \r\nprepared, especially for economic reasons, to make an additional effort in \r\norder to codify the experience and norms of international law in this sphere. \r\nOn this occasion I cannot but add a few words of criticism concerning ths \r\ninadequate action by international factors to solve the crisis in the \r\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia, more precisely in preventing the brutal \r\naggression waged by Serbia and Montenegro against Croatia and Bosnia and \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n18 \r\n(President Tudjman) \r\nHerzegovina. Croatia appreciates the efforts of the international community -\r\nfrom the United Nations, the European Community and the CSCE to all those \r\ninternational factors that have helped us to stop a mindless and most brutal \r\nwar waged at the expense of the civilian population before the eyes of the \r\ncivilized world. We express our deepest sympathy for the human losses the \r\nUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has suffered in the Republic of \r\nCroatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the performance of its \r\nnoblest task. \r\nWhat is really happening there is the sustained aggression of Serbia and \r\nMontenegro, now acting under the new name of the Federal Republic of \r\nYugoslavia, against two sovereign and independent States Members of the United \r\nNations - Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Unless stopped, this aggression \r\nmay mushroom into a conflict on a much broader scale which could spread the \r\ndisaster of war to the entire European continent, maybe even to the rest of \r\nthe world. Unfortunately, in spite of that situation the global community has \r\nnot yet identified a sufficiently efficient mechanism to stop aggression or an \r\neffective way to stop brutal destruction, such as Europe has hardly ever \r\nexperienced, associated with the most barbaric form of \"ethnic cleansing\". \r\nThe implementation of the Vance plan, created with the authority of the United \r\nNations, is also falling behind schedule because of constant Serbian and \r\nMontenegrin sabotage. \r\nThe mission of UNPROFOR must be seriously speeded up and fully \r\nimplemented within the mandate of the peace-keeping force. Otherwise it will \r\nbecome meaningless and produce the justified indignation and frustration of \r\nthe Croatian people who continue to suffer the consequences of aggression. \r\nCroatian authorities find it increasingly difficult to control the justified \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n19 \r\n(President Tudjman) \r\ndiscontent of people displaced from their homes in their own homeland, people \r\nwho have accepted the role and the intentions of the United Nations and the \r\nEuropean Community with optimism and the firm conviction that the wrongs they \r\nhave suffered would be redressed. These people find it difficult to \r\nunderstand why the international community cannot show, in this particular \r\ncase, the necessary determination that was shown in the instance of an \r\nidentical aggression against another sovereign and independent State. The \r\nUnited Nations must summon the will and the power to use all the resources at \r\nits disposal in order to bring the war in Croatia to a close and to stop the \r\naggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the opposite case, if the \r\naggressor is permitted to continue to implement his plan of conguest, the \r\nreputation of the United Nations will suffer badly. \r\nFinally, let me express my conviction that the United Nations will fulfil \r\nits historical task. For its part the Republic of Croatia is prepared to \r\ncontribute its share in every respect as a full member of the global community. \r\nWith the holding of multi-party parliamentary elections for the second \r\ntime in the past two years, in spite of the war forced upon the country, \r\nCroatia has severed all links with its communist past and strengthened its \r\ndemocratic order and international position. \r\nHaving committed itself in its Constitution - in political and economic \r\nterms and in all spheres of spiritual and material development - to those \r\nprinciples of democracy and pluralism which also underlie the United Nations, \r\nCroatia has declared its openness to cooperation with all its neighbours and \r\nother countries in Europe and world wide. Croatia wants to be a factor of \r\npeace and stability in the international order in its part of the world. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n20 \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe President of the Republic of Croatia for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Franio Tudjman.

Yet, the efforts for adaptation to a world not structured \r\nby the East-West divide have not yet been undertaken. As the images of \r\nviolence, famine and destruction flicker on our television sets the urge that \r\nsomething must be done quickly seizes the consciousness and imagination of \r\npeople everywhere. \r\nThe world community turns to the United Nations the only universal \r\nforum at its disposal full of expectations that it will succeed in putting \r\nan end to the violence, the senseless destruction of human life and economic \r\nresources which, at this very moment, are plunging millions of people in every \r\npart of the world into despair. \r\nThe end of the cold war confrontation opened the way for increased \r\ncooperation. The triumph of democracy and the cooperation of the major Powers \r\ncreated possibilities for the resolution of conflicts which had originated in, \r\nor were maintained by, the earlier East-West confrontation. The universal \r\naspiration for a world of peace, liberated from the bondage of insecurity, was \r\nthus quite rightly roused. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n22 \r\n(President Vassiliou) \r\nDuring this post-cold-war period we have witnessed positive developments \r\nin many regional problems, particularly Cambodia, Southern Africa, Central \r\nAmerica and elsewhere. At the same time, an effort has been undertaken to \r\nfind lasting peace in the Middle East through the convening of a peace \r\nconference. We welcome this positive and important development in the hope \r\nthat it will lead to a comprehensive solution, safeguarding the legitimate \r\nrights of the Palestinian people while, at the same time, ensuring the \r\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). For \r\nit is our position that all United Nations resolutions must be implemented, \r\nwhichever country they concern, be it Iraq, Cyprus or former Yugoslavia. \r\nFurthermore we welcome the developments in South Africa that should lead \r\nto the end of the abhorrent regime of apartheid, in the hope that never again \r\nwill any human beings on the face of this Earth be forced to live in \r\nconditions of racial, ethnic, religious or other separation from their fellow \r\nhuman beings. \r\nThe fact that today we welcome 20 new Members in this universal \r\nOrganization is sufficient evidence of the tremendous forces at work following \r\nthe end of the East-West divide. Welcoming each and every one of these \r\ncountries, and all of them as a whole, I express our desire to work and \r\ncooperate with them to uphold the principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, in the interest of peace, security and the well-being of all. \r\nThe conditions are favourable for the United Nations, as the process for \r\na much stronger and effective Organization matures and gains momentum. \r\nHowever, the challenges that the Organization and its Members are called upon \r\nto meet are also crucial, for, as the old order crumbled, unparalleled forces \r\nof destruction were also unleashed. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n23 \r\n(President Vassiliou) \r\nThe aspirations of humanity for a better world meet with disappointment \r\nin every part of the world. The proliferation of conflicts, due to a variety \r\nof reasons, is the other face of Janus. Along with the conflicts come the \r\nlong lines of refugees, the dead, the starving children, looking desperately \r\nto each one of us. \r\nEighteen years after Cyprus suffered the devastating effects of \"ethnic \r\ncleansing\" following the Turkish invasion of 1974, we are again witnessing the \r\nrestaging of similar tragedies in other parts of the world. In 1974, Turkey, \r\na strong neighbour of small Cyprus, invaded and occupied 37 per cent of the \r\nterritory of the Republic. One third of the Greek Cypriots were evicted from \r\ntheir ancestral homes and properties in order to create \"ethnically clean \r\nareas\". Being weak and defenseless, we turned to the United Nations. It is \r\nto the United Nations that a great part of humanity is at this very moment \r\nalso turning for help. \r\nThe demands are greater now and they are tending to increase. The fact \r\nthat the world Organization is free of the fetters imposed by the adversarial \r\nrelations of the super-Powers in the cold war era enhances its possibilities. \r\nThe burden, however, will be unbearable if the process towards a more \r\neffective United Nations, with the necessary resources and increased \r\ncapabilities not only in the field of peace-keeping, but particularly in the \r\nfields of peace-making and conflict prevention, as analysed in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral\u0027s Agenda for Peace - is not quickly realized. \r\nCyprus can again be brought up as a case-study and example. \r\nFollowing the invasion in 1974, the United Nations system was mobilised\u0027 \r\nThe Security Council and the General Assembly adopted resolutions demanding \r\nrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus and an \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n24-25 \r\n(President Vassiliou) \r\nimmediate end to foreign military intervention and called urgently for a \r\ncease-fire. The United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) \r\nsupervised the cease-fire and assured the peace-keeping operation. It has \r\nfulfilled this role as well as other humanitarian functions admirably. And we \r\nare grateful to all the men who served in UNFICYP for their contribution. But \r\n18 years later, the Cyprus problem is still not solved and as a consequence \r\nUNFICYP is confronted with serious financial problems. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n26 \r\n(President Vassiliou) \r\nIf even a small number of the peace-keeping operations the United Nations \r\nis now undertaking have the duration of UNFICYP, given their scale and scope, \r\nvery soon the Organization will not be able to cope with the financial and \r\nother burdens. \r\nThe Cyprus example is, I believe, sufficient evidence that an intense \r\npeace-making effort must be pursued in parallel with every peace-keeping \r\noperation. For the cost can be limited not by simply eliminating the role, \r\nbut by opening the way for just and viable solutions. \r\nIn the case of Cyprus, despite the lack of results because of the \r\nnegative attitude of the Turkish side during the long negotiations aimed at \r\nfinding a solution, the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, \r\ncorrectly seized the moment and pursued an intense, renewed effort to this \r\nend. The Security Council, already actively involved in the process, put its \r\nweight behind those efforts and engaged itself in an unprecedented way. \r\nWe took our share of responsibility and engaged in those talks in the \r\nspirit of good will and conciliation. For we want to put an end to the \r\nforcible division of our country and the resulting suffering of so many, \r\nparticularly of the families of the missing persons. In brief, we want to see \r\nan end to the status quo, characterized by the Security Council as not \r\nacceptable. \r\nUnfortunately, the Turkish side remained intransigent on its aims of \r\nperpetuating the division of Cyprus into two \"ethnically clean\" regions, in \r\nutter violation of human rights and basic rules of international law. Even \r\ntoday we hear voices from Turkey speaking against federation, claiming that \r\nsince two different communities live on Cyprus the island should be \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n27 \r\n(President Vassiliou) \r\npartitioned. Just imagine how the world would look if this principle were \r\napplied universally. \r\nAs the Secretary-General underlined in an interview a few days ago, the \r\nnew danger that will appear in the world in the next 10 years is more \r\nfragmentation. Rather than 100 or 200 countries, said the Secretary-General, \r\nthere may be at the end of the century 400 countries. By way of example he \r\nwent on to say that in Africa there are 5,000 tribes, and if each tribe \r\nclaimed the right to self-determination we would end up with many small States \r\nof 50,000 to 100,000 people each. We can all imagine the effects that this \r\nwould have on the hopes of humanity for sustainable development. That is why \r\nwhat happens in Cyprus and the solution of the Cyprus problem based on United \r\nNations resolutions must be of concern to the international community. \r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on Cyprus (S/24472) clearly shows why \r\nno progress was made in the July and August talks. Furthermore, the \"Set of \r\nideas\" and the map which are annexed to the report have been endorsed by the \r\nSecurity Council in resolution 774 (1992) as the basis for reaching a \r\nsolution. We should like, in this context, to express our appreciation and \r\nthanks to the Secretary-General and the Security Council for all their support \r\nand involvement in our case. \r\nThe resolution also calls for resumption of the talks on 26 October. As \r\nalways, we intend to cooperate fully with the Secretary-General and negotiate \r\nwith good will. We sincerely hope that the Turkish side, despite its so-far \r\nnegative public statements, will at long last cooperate. \r\nIf, despite the efforts of the Secretary-General, our good will and the \r\ninvolvement of the Security Council, the talks in Oetober become a repetition \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n28 \r\n(President Vassiliou) \r\nof the unpleasant exercise we experienced this summer, we are confident that \r\nthe Security Council and the Assembly will assure the conditions for progress. \r\nFor it would be tragic further to delay, or even frustrate, the effort \r\nfor a solution in Cyprus. The people of Cyprus, Turkish Cypriots and Greek \r\nCypriots alike, want to put the past behind them and advance towards a better \r\nfuture. The reunification of Cyprus will open a new era of prosperity and \r\nprogress to the benefit of all Cypriots in particular, of Turkish Cypriots \r\nand our region. I am certain that the solution of the Cyprus problem is the \r\nonly way, and a necessary condition, for the economic and social development \r\nof all Cypriots. In this competitive world of ours, only if Turkish Cypriots \r\nand Greek Cypriots are united and join forces will they be able to win the \r\nplace they deserve in the world. \r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s \"Agenda for Peace\" introduces peace-building and \r\npreventive diplomacy as concepts of the utmost importance. The conceptual \r\nframework of the \"Agenda\" is indeed remarkable in its ramifications and the \r\nlinkages it establishes between peace and security, international law, \r\ndemocracy, human rights and sustainable development. \r\nCyprus, which accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, welcomes and supports the Secretary-General\u0027s proposals in \r\nthe field of international law, as set out in the report. \r\nOur long-term efforts should be aimed at creating such conditions as will \r\nmake the possibility of war unthinkable, even between nations that have a \r\nhistory of enmity. In order to achieve such a result on a global basis the \r\nUnited Nations must adapt itself swiftly to the changing conditions. A better \r\nbalance and coordination between the various bodies that form the Organization \r\nand the specialized agencies are needed. A more effective and more democratic \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n29-30 \r\n(President Vassiliou) \r\nUnited Nations is an essential component of a stable and democratic world \r\norder. Furthermore, as the Secretary-General pointedly underlines in his \r\nreport to the General Assembly, we must render our Organization \r\n\"capable of dealing comprehensively with the economic, social, \r\nenvironmental and political dimensions of human development.\" (A/47/1. \r\npara. 9) \r\nThe General Assembly, representing all the Members of the United Nations, \r\nhas a major role to play in the realization of this major objective. And I am \r\ncertain that under the able leadership of our President, my good friend the \r\nForeign Minister of Bulgaria, Mr. Ganev, it will rise to these challenges. I \r\nalso take this opportunity to pay tribute, Mr. President, to your predecessor, \r\nMr. Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for the skilful manner in \r\nwhich he steered the work of the forty-sixth session. \r\nProminent among the challenges we have to meet is the protection of human \r\nrights in all their dimensions, civil and political as well as social, \r\neconomic and cultural. The progress achieved in this field during recent \r\nyears, encouraging though it is, should not mislead us. Much progress still \r\nneeds to be achieved. That is why we look forward to the World Conference on \r\nHuman Rights, which will present us with a great opportunity not only to \r\nassess the progress achieved so far, but also, and mainly, to define the means \r\nfor rendering our collective action for the protection of human rights more \r\neffective. \r\nThe issue of human rights is crucial, for it relates not only to \r\npeace-making and peace-building, but also to preventive diplomacy. The first \r\nvictims of galloping nationalism and micronationalism everywhere, as we can \r\nclearly see, are the human rights of citizens. We in Cyprus, unfortunately, \r\nhave bitter experience of this fact. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n31 \r\n(President Vassiliou) \r\nTolerance and respect for the beliefs and particularities of others \r\nwithin societies and peaceful relations among nations are the conditions \r\nfor the prevalence of the rule of law and thus of human rights. And as \r\npeace is no longer the end product of mutual fear, it will be maintained \r\nonly through the prevalence of mutual understanding, communication and \r\nconfidence. In this respect, the process of disarmament has a key \r\nfunction to play. \r\nIn spite of the progress we all welcome, and in particular the \r\nagreement reached within the Conference on Disarmament on a draft \r\nconvention for the elimination of chemical weapons, disarmament is still \r\nof the utmost priority in our quest for general stability. The positive \r\ndevelopments in the field of nuclear weapons constitute an asset that has \r\nto be safeguarded. However, the risk of intense arms races between \r\nregional Powers is more than a threat: it is a reality. \r\nIt is only through eliminating the roots of insecurity, which makes \r\nthe acquisition of arms a vital need for States, and through creating the \r\ninstitutional framework that will enhance the feeling of security and \r\nthereby diminish to the maximum the need for self-help in case of \r\naggression, that real progress can be achieved. \r\nWe know how painful it is to spend precious resources on arms and we \r\nhurt when we have to pay a few million dollars just to buy a new tank. \r\nBut what other choice are we left with when on a small island like Cyprus \r\nthe Turkish army outnumbers us in this field by a ratio of 7 to 1, \r\nconstantly threatening our physical existence? Time and again we have \r\nproposed the demilitarization of Cyprus, together with the withdrawal of \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n32 \r\n(President Vassiliou) \r\nthe Turkish forces from Cyprus. We are committed to using the resources \r\nthus saved for development purposes - most of them directed to projects \r\nthat will have an immediate effect on the standard of living of the \r\nTurkish Cypriots. Thus, the peace-building process will be further \r\nstrengthened and the people of Cyprus as a whole will benefit. \r\nHuman rights and democracy will amount to little if social misery, \r\nstarvation and underdevelopment are the lot of the great majority of the \r\npopulation of this planet. The fragile flower of democracy cannot bloom \r\non the arid soil of poverty. What sense can the right to vote have if one \r\nis condemned to remain hungry, roofless and without the very basic \r\nnecessities? \r\nAs the Jakarta Declaration, adopted during the tenth non-aligned \r\nsummit only some weeks ago, clearly states: \r\n\"A shift of forces in international relations towards strengthening \r\nmultilateral cooperation for development has become indispensable.\" \r\nThe division between rich and poor, developed and developing, should \r\nnot be allowed to become a new source of instability and tension that \r\nwould undermine the foundations of international society. It is an \r\nillusion to think that any country, however rich or great, can survive \r\nisolated, surrounded by an archipelago of poverty. \r\nIf we want peace and social stability we must address the issues of \r\ngrowth and sustainable development in their human and social dimensions. \r\nIndebtedness, mainly due to the collapse of commodity prices and the \r\nsubsequent transfer of resources from poor to rich countries, continues to \r\nhurt the developing world. Barriers to trade raise formidable obstacles \r\nto the efforts of developing countries to reach the markets of the highly \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n33 \r\n(President Vassiliou) \r\nindustrialized North and limit their possibilities for growth while having \r\nan adverse effect on the export prices of their products. That is why we \r\nare anxious about the delay in concluding the Uruguay Round of \r\nMultilateral Trade Negotiations and express the hope that the target for \r\ncompleting the negotiations - that is, the end of 1992 will be achieved \r\nthis time. Developing nations\u0027 access to technology is still very \r\nrestricted and this adds to the already existing inequalities that hamper \r\ngrowth on a global level. \r\nTechnology is not an end in itself. The transfer of technologies \r\nfrom developed to developing countries is a pre-condition for sustainable \r\ndevelopment on a global scale. The problem is also directly linked to \r\nthat of the flow of financial resources for productive investment in \r\ndeveloping countries. What is at stake here is not only the solidarity \r\nthat developed countries should demonstrate. It is also a rational \r\nresponse that will guarantee their own ability to continue to progress in \r\na world which progresses as a whole. \r\nIt is now widely acknowledged that in our quest for development in \r\nthe past we regarded environment solely as a commodity ripe for \r\nexploitation. Now we have come to realize that it is man who belongs to \r\nthe environment and not the environment to man. It is therefore necessary \r\nto define a new synthesis between environment and development. The Rio \r\nConference was a major step in that direction. The world summit gave the \r\ncorrect message; it shaped the international will and marked a new \r\nbeginning. Concrete and effective measures must follow. The Rio \r\nDeclaration must not remain a dead letter. We have to translate into \r\naction its provisions, which should guide us in every policy decision. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n34-35 \r\n(President Vassiliou) \r\nThe 1990s is a decade of dramatic changes. The contradictory forces \r\nand undercurrents that shape the outcome of events must be shaped and \r\nguided towards the creation of a peaceful and democratic world order. The \r\nUnited Nations is the soul itself, the consciousness of humanity as a \r\ncollective entity. As such, it demonstrates a flexibility and a capacity \r\nfor adaptation which are admirable. People of worth, dedicated men and \r\nwomen, work in every part of the world fulfilling impossible missions. We \r\nthank them all. \r\nWe have reached a moment when, as Member States, we must assume \r\nfurther responsibilities and, faithful to the principles of the Charter of \r\nthis Organization, work in unison in helping the United Nations to achieve \r\nits objectives. Humanity has conguered mighty and formidable peaks. We \r\ncannot turn back. We are committed to shaping and channelling the hopes \r\nand aspirations of mankind for a more free, democratic and tolerant world, \r\nwith a better quality of life for all. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly, I wish to \r\nthank the President of the Republic of Cyprus for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\nMr. George Vassiliou. President of the Republic of Cyprus, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n36 \r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued) \r\nGENERAL DEBATE \r\nMr. KANJU (Pakistan): This session of the General Assembly is \r\ntaking place at the dawn of a new era. The international structure \r\nconstructed since the Second World War on the balance of terror between the \r\nsuper-Powers has broken down. We perceive new opportunities to promote peace \r\nand to accelerate progress throughout the world. Yet we face new and \r\nunprecedented problems, both regional and global. \r\nThe international community must squarely face the challenges and seize \r\nthe opportunities that the momentous developments of the past few years have \r\npresented. We must build a peaceful, stable and progressive international \r\norder on the debris of the cold war, an international order where principles \r\nof eguity and fair play govern the conduct of States, where the weak live \r\nwithout fear of domination by the strong, where prosperity flourishes and \r\nwhere human dignity is safeguarded. \r\nSuch a new international order can come about only through concrete steps \r\nagreed by the vast majority of the international community. The United \r\nNations is the only forum where we can concert our actions to construct new \r\narrangements for global peace and prosperity. The Assembly should take the \r\ninitiative by adopting an appropriate action plan in this emerging era of \r\ninternational relations. I should like to take this opportunity to outline \r\nPakistan\u0027s views and suggestions on the elements of such an action plan. \r\nTo build a new and effective framework for peace and progress, the world \r\ncommunity must achieve five major objectives. \r\nThe first objective is the promotion of a structure of global security \r\nthat ensures the security of both large and small States, of both weak and \r\npowerful nations. Historically, threats to international peace and stability \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n37 \r\n(Mr. Kanju. Pakistan) \r\nhave emanated from the drive for power and hegemony sustained by the \r\naccumulation of massive military arsenals. An international order based on \r\nhegemony will always remain unstable, because it is unjust. The challenge \r\nbefore us is to build a new international structure that would check the \r\nhegemonic ambitions of the powerful nations and promote disarmament at global \r\nand regional levels. Only through such measures can we create a just and \r\nstable order ensuring global and regional peace and security. Such a \r\nstructure presupposes the revitalization of the United Nations on democratic \r\nlines to regulate inter-State conduct in conformity with recognized principles \r\nof inter-State behaviour, particularly the exercise of the right of peoples to \r\nself-determination, respect for the sovereign equality and territorial \r\nintegrity of States, non-interference in internal affairs, non-use of force in \r\ninternational relations and peaceful resolution of international disputes. \r\nA comprehensive programme of disarmament at global and regional levels \r\nconstitutes the second pillar of a stable structure of international security. \r\nSignificant reductions in weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear \r\nweapons, leading ultimately to their total elimination, and in conventional \r\narsenals are essential elements of the disarmament process. Pending the total \r\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction, their proliferation must be \r\narrested. We have welcomed the agreements between the United States and the \r\nRussian Federation which will reduce their strategic nuclear arsenals by \r\nhalf, in the present conditions of instability, further reduction of these \r\nnuclear warheads is a pressing priority. Pakistan hopes that their number \r\nwill be drastically cut, leading to their eventual elimination all over the \r\nglobe. This is no longer a Utopian goal. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n38 \r\n(Mr. Kanju. Pakistan) \r\nUntil complete nuclear disarmament has been achieved, the nuclear-weapon \r\nPowers are under the obligation to assure the non-nuclear-weapon States \r\nagainst the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. With the end of the cold \r\nwar, there is no reason why such assurances cannot be extended to the \r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States unconditionally and in a legally binding manner. \r\nAn essential element in the programme for nuclear disarmament is the \r\nacceptance by all States of a permanent ban on nuclear-weapon testing. The \r\nabsence of a comprehensive nuclear-test ban will, in the long run, compromise \r\nthe goal of nuclear non-proliferation. We further believe that the conclusion \r\nof nuclear-test-ban agreements among regional States in different parts of the \r\nworld not only would facilitate the conclusion of a comprehensive \r\nnuclear-test-ban treaty but would also act as an important confidence-buildinq \r\nmeasure at regional levels. \r\nDisarmament and non-proliferation are two sides of the same coin. \r\nPakistan fully agrees that the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other \r\nweapons of mass destruction would increase the danger to world peace and \r\nsecurity. Non-proliferation measures can gain universal credibility and \r\nacceptance if their scope and application are comprehensive and \r\nnon-discriminatory. This pre-condition applies as much to nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation as it does to the endeavour to control the spread of medium-\r\nand long-range missiles. \r\nWith the end of the cold war and tangible progress in arms reductions \r\nbetween the two pre-eminent nuclear Powers, the urgency of promoting regional \r\ndisarmament is greater than ever before. Today threats to peace arise largely \r\nfrom regional discords and divisions. The armaments race is increasingly \r\nacquiring a regional dimension. Global peace and security will remain in \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n39-40 \r\n(Mr. Kanju. Pakistan) \r\njeopardy unless greater attention is paid to regional security concerns. In \r\nrecognition of this reality, the United Nations has begun to focus on the need \r\nto promote disarmament at the regional level. This is evidenced by the \r\nadoption at the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly of the resolution \r\non regional disarmament by an overwhelming majority. This approach also \r\nfeatured prominently in the deliberations of the Disarmament Commission at its \r\nlast session. This trend needs to be encouraged and strengthened. \r\nPakistan fully subscribes to the objectives of the draft Convention on \r\nthe prohibition of chemical weapons, which has been transmitted to the General \r\nAssembly by the Conference on Disarmament. We completely share the resolve of \r\nthe international community to banish forever this hideous instrument of \r\nwarfare. However, the draft Convention contains some provisions that cause us \r\nconcern. It remains our hope that these shortcomings will be redressed to \r\nensure universal adherence to this truly landmark document. \r\nThe second objective of an action plan for peace and progress should be \r\nto promote the fullest application of the principle of self-determination. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n41 \r\n(Mr. Kanju. Pakistan) \r\nThe principle of self-determination is the bedrock of the present system \r\nof international relations between sovereign, independent States. Over the \r\npast 45 years, the exercise of this right has led to the independence of the \r\nmajority of the States represented in this Hall. All peoples under colonial \r\nor alien domination or foreign occupation are entitled to self-determination. \r\nThis has been repeatedly recognized by the United Nations. \r\nThe process of self-determination remains incomplete. In its resolutions \r\nof 1948 and 1949 the Security Council decided that the future of Jammu and \r\nKashmir should be determined in accordance with the wishes of its people, to \r\nbe expressed in a free and fair plebiscite under United Nations auspices. \r\nPakistan and India both undertook to implement those resolutions. That was \r\nthe first time that the Council set out the actual process by which the right \r\nof self-determination was to be exercised. It is ironic and sad that the \r\nfirst resolutions of the Security Council providing for the exercise of the \r\nright of self-determination remain unimplemented. \r\nThe passage of a generation has not extinguished the desire for \r\nself-determination in Kashmir. It is the children of 1947 who are now \r\nsacrificing their lives in the struggle for Kashmir\u0027s freedom from Indian \r\nrule. Since 1990 more than 10,000 Kashmiri men, women and children have been \r\nkilled. According to Amnesty International, an estimated 15,000 citizens are \r\nin prisons and torture cells in Kashmir. The brutal repression unleashed by a \r\nsecurity force, of over 400,000 has failed to break the spirit of the Kashmiri \r\npeople. Pakistan cannot remain indifferent to their sufferings. We will \r\ncontinue to extend full moral, diplomatic and political support to the \r\nstruggle of the Kashmiri people for self-determination. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n42 \r\n(Mr. Kanju. Pakistan) \r\nPeace and tranquillity cannot return to South Asia unless this \r\noutstanding dispute is resolved. Pakistan has proposed to India the \r\ncommencement of a bilateral dialogue in accordance with the Simla Agreement to \r\nreach a final settlement of the Kashmir dispute on the basis of the United \r\nNations resolutions. We hope this dialogue can start without further delay. \r\nWe call upon the international community to persuade India to desist from \r\nits policy of suppression and to enter into a serious dialogue with us with a \r\nview to resolving this dispute in accordance with the resolutions of the \r\nSecurity Council and in the spirit of the Simla Agreement. \r\nMay I also urge the Secretary-General to use his high office to persuade \r\nIndia to desist from the path of violence and suppression against the Kashmiri \r\npeople and to allow them the exercise of their right to self-determination as \r\nenvisaged in the Security Council resolutions. Attempts by India to portray \r\nthe 45-year-old just struggle of the Kashmiri people in terms of external \r\ninterference are aimed at distorting the historical facts and should therefore \r\nbe rejected outright. \r\nI reiterate before the Assembly Pakistan\u0027s long-standing proposal to \r\nstation impartial observers along the line of control to investigate and \r\nverify accusations of interference. We made this proposal in all sincerity \r\nand are convinced that such a mechanism would help establish the correct \r\nposition beyond any shadow of doubt. That position is that the uprising in \r\nIndian-held Kashmir is entirely indigenous and spontaneous. Indeed, India\u0027s \r\npersistent rejection of our proposal exposes the hollowness of its allegations. \r\nThe people of Palestine too have been denied their right to \r\nself-determination. Pakistan shares the hope that the current Middle East \r\npeace process will lead to a just and comprehensive settlement in the Middle \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n43 \r\n(Mr. Kanju. Pakistan) \r\nEast based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). \r\nPakistan also shares the view that the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all \r\nArab and Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, including Al-Quds \r\nAl-Sharif, and the exercise of the right to self-determination by the \r\nPalestinian people are essential to ensure a durable peace in the Middle East. \r\nIn South Africa, some progress has been made towards eliminating \r\napartheid. However, the recent violence threatens to disrupt the negotiating \r\nprocess. The South African Government must shoulder its responsibility for \r\nsalvaging the negotiations by taking immediate steps to stop the bloodshed and \r\nbring to book those responsible for the recent massacres. Meanwhile, \r\ninternational pressure against South Africa should be maintained until the \r\npositive changes introduced in the last two years become irreversible and the \r\nSouth African people\u0027s struggle for justice, equality and majority rule is \r\nfinally crowned with success. \r\nPakistan fully supports the efforts of the Secretary-General in \r\nimplementing the peace settlement in Cambodia. We call upon all Cambodian \r\nfactions to cooperate with the United Nations in creating conditions conducive \r\nto the establishment of a national Government in Cambodia. Pakistan\u0027s \r\ncommitment to the Cambodian peace settlement is evidenced by its substantial \r\ncontribution to the United Nations Transition Authority in Cambodia, to which \r\nwe have provided a full infantry battalion. \r\nThe valiant people of Afghanistan have finally regained control over \r\ntheir destiny. On 28 April 1992 an interim Afghan Government assumed power in \r\nKabul. Pakistan congratulates the people of Afghanistan on their triumph and \r\npledges to them its complete support and cooperation in the arduous task of \r\nnation-building and reconstruction. We are determined to develop close and \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n44 \r\n(Mr. Kanju. Pakistan) \r\ncooperative relations with Afghanistan on the basis of sovereign equality and \r\nmutual respect. It is our sincere hope that the process of reconciliation in \r\nAfghanistan will be accelerated and that the people of that country will be \r\nable to live in peace and harmony. We urge the international community to \r\nmake its due contribution to the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the \r\nrehabilitation of the returning refugees, as well as to the maintenance of the \r\nremaining millions of refugees in Pakistan and Iran. For its part, Pakistan \r\nis ready to make its contribution to the gigantic task of rebuilding the \r\nwar-ravaged Afghan economy. \r\nPakistan welcomes the new Members of the United Nations: Armenia, \r\nAzerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, \r\nMoldova, San Marino, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Their \r\npresence in this Hall is a source of strength for the United Nations. \r\nUnfortunately, one of these new Member States is being subjected to \r\nbrutal aggression. This world body must strongly oppose this aggression. We \r\ncall on the Security Council to take action, including the use of force under \r\nArticle 42 of the Charter, to reverse the Serbian aggression and restore the \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia \r\ndeserves assistance in accordance with the Charter\u0027s provisions on \r\nself-defence. The Security Council should lift sanctions to enable Bosnia to \r\nreceive such assistance. We further urge that an international tribunal be \r\nestablished immediately to prosecute and punish the reported war crimes by \r\nSerbian forces, including the genocidal practice of \"ethnic cleansing\". The \r\nworld community must also make more determined efforts to ensure that \r\nhumanitarian assistance reaches the suffering people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n45 \r\n(Mr. Kanju. Pakistan) \r\nPakistan holds the view that the former Socialist Federal Republic of \r\nYugoslavia has ceased to exist. Serbia and Montenegro, therefore, should not \r\nbe allowed to take the seat of the former Yugoslavia in the United Nations. \r\nThe third objective we must promote in an action plan is the \r\nestablishment of viable structures for regional peace and security as \r\nenvisaged in Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. With the end of the \r\ncold war, threats to peace and security are most likely to be regional rather \r\nthan global in origin and dimension. It is, therefore, in the regional \r\ncontext that the barricades against war must be constructed. \r\nPakistan desires good-neighbourly relations with India. We want to \r\ndevote our energies to the vital task of economic and social development. We \r\nwant our people to live in dignity. These goals cannot be attained unless a \r\nclimate of trust and cooperation prevails in South Asia. \r\nIn South Asia, as elsewhere, a balance in the military capabilities of \r\nthe regional States is essential to build and maintain a viable structure of \r\npeace and security. Pakistan has made proposals to India for a regional or \r\nbilateral agreement to ensure nuclear non-proliferation, the total prohibition \r\nof all weapons of mass destruction, and mutual and balanced reduction of the \r\nconventional forces of the two countries. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n46 \r\n(Mr. Kanju. Pakistan) \r\nPakistan and India have concluded agreements not to attack each other\u0027s \r\nnuclear facilities and on prior notification of military exercises and \r\nprevention of air violations. Recently, we also signed a declaration on the \r\ntotal prohibition of chemical weapons. \r\nRegrettably, India remains unresponsive to the proposals aimed at \r\nensuring nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia and bringing about a mutual \r\nand balanced reduction of conventional forces. It continues to vote against \r\nthe proposal for establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia, which \r\nhas been repeatedly endorsed by the Assembly. India has yet to accept the \r\nproposal for talks involving the United States, the Russian Federation and \r\nChina, as well as India and Pakistan, to ensure nuclear non-proliferation in \r\nSouth Asia. All the other proposed participants have responded positively to \r\nthe proposal. \r\nPakistan stands at the crossroads of South Asia, Central Asia, China, \r\nWest Asia and the Gulf. In the past, this region was the subject of the great \r\ngame between rival imperialist Powers. With the end of the cold war and the \r\nemergence of the independent republics of Central Asia, Pakistan hopes to \r\nserve as a link between interlocking structures for economic and commercial \r\ncooperation in these adjacent regions of Asia. The admission of the Central \r\nAsian States in the Economic Cooperation Organization, grouping Pakistan, Iran \r\nand Turkey, will help towards the emergence of the region as a vibrant \r\neconomic entity. Pakistan enjoys close fraternal relations with the member \r\nStates of the Gulf Cooperation Council and we hope to promote cooperation and \r\nmoderation in the Gulf region. Similarly, the South Asian Association for \r\nRegional Cooperation can make a positive contribution to the evolution of a \r\nnew era in the relations among the regional States. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n47 \r\n(Mr. Kanju. Pakistan) \r\nThreats to the security of the littoral and hinterland States of the \r\nIndian Ocean arise mainly due to large disparities in their military \r\ncapabilities. The Prime Minister of Pakistan has proposed a conference of the \r\nlittoral and hinterland States to agree upon measures for strengthening \r\nregional peace and security. The maintenance of an eguitable balance in the \r\nland, air and naval forces of the regional States is an essential prerequisite \r\nfor achieving this objective. The Assembly should suggest appropriate \r\nguidelines to the United Nations Committee on the Indian Ocean to evolve a new \r\nframework for peace and security in that strategic region. \r\nA fourth and essential objective of the Action Plan for Peace and \r\nProgress must be to revive global economic growth and restructure \r\ninternational economic relations on a just and equitable basis. As the \r\nSecretary-General has pointed out in his report on the work of the \r\nOrganization: \r\n\"Political progress and economic development are inseparable: both \r\nare equally important and must be pursued simultaneously\". \r\n(A/47/1, para. 64) \r\nGrowth in the world economy has been imbalanced. The gap between the \r\ndeveloped and the developing countries has increased. The incidence of \r\nabsolute poverty is growing. Recurrent economic recessions have reinforced \r\ntrade protectionism and frozen the level of development assistance.- This, \r\ncombined with the crushing burden of the external debt-servicing of the \r\ndeveloping countries, has led to the invidious phenomenon of negative resource \r\nflows. \r\nWe cannot allow growing economic disparities in an increasingly \r\ninterdependent world in which destinies of nations are linked. Further \r\ndeprivation in the third world can endanger international peace and \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n48 \r\n(Mr. Kanju. Pakistan) \r\nstability. On the other hand, the integration of the developing countries in \r\nthe world\u0027s financial and trading system can contribute immensely to global \r\noutput, as we have witnessed in East Asia. Indeed, there is a unique \r\nopportunity today to create a truly global economy, since the developing \r\ncountries, as well as the Central and Eastern European States, have adopted \r\nthe principles of free markets and open trade. \r\nPakistan recommends the following steps to revive world economic growth \r\nand improve the plight of the developing countries. First, the major \r\nindustrialized countries should take the policy actions required in the fiscal \r\nand monetary fields to revive global growth and break out of the current \r\nrecession. Second, they must overcome the special interests that are pressing \r\nfor protectionism, and conclude the Uruguay Round without further delay. \r\nThird, the debt burden of the developing countries should be effectively \r\nameliorated. Countries that have scrupulously serviced their debts, imposing \r\na great sacrifice on their peoples, could be offered relief through generous \r\nbalance-of-payments support. Fourth, the developing countries should be \r\nprovided preferential access in the regional trade areas in Europe and North \r\nAmerica. Fifth, financial resources must be generated to meet the development \r\nneeds of the poorest countries. Sixth, the developed countries should support \r\nmechanisms designed to stabilize commodity prices, including agricultural \r\ncommodities. Seventh, an extensive programme of technical assistance and \r\ntraining should be undertaken in the developing countries to enhance their \r\ncapacity to implement economic and social development projects. Eighth, \r\nadditional resources and technology should be made available to integrate \r\nenvironmental and socio-economic objectives for sustainable development in \r\naccordance with the commitments of the Rio Conference. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n49 \r\n(Mr. Kanju. Pakistan) \r\nAs the current Chairman of the Group of 77, Pakistan will work to evolve \r\ncommon positions for the developing countries on all the major economic \r\nissues, including the follow-up of the United Nations Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development and the reform and revitalization of the \r\nOrganization in economic and social fields. We also look forward to \r\nconstructive cooperation with our developed-country partners. \r\nThe present Government of Pakistan has introduced a free-market \r\nrevolution in the country. We are seeking economic growth by releasing the \r\ndynamism of our private sector. These reforms are based on deregulation and \r\nprivatization. We have offered generous incentives for investment, including \r\nforeign investment. We have encouraged export-led growth. The response to \r\nthese reforms has been most heartening. Private investment has accelerated; \r\nour exports have continued to increase despite the global economic slowdown. \r\nThe Pakistan economy has grown by over 6 per cent annually during the past few \r\nyears despite the constraints of a drastic structural adjustment programme. \r\nUnfortunately, heavy floods have dealt Pakistan a severe blow. Over \r\n2,000 people have perished. The damage to our public infrastructure, private \r\nproperty, and agriculture is estimated in the billions of dollars. We have \r\nfully mobilized our governmental machinery to recover from the effects of this \r\nnatural calamity. We greatly appreciate the international expressions of \r\nsympathy and support. We are grateful for the assistance offered to Pakistan \r\nby the world community for relief and rehabilitation in flood-affected areas. \r\nPakistanis are a resilient people and are facing this natural calamity with \r\ncourage. \r\nThe final and vital objective of our Action Plan should be to strengthen \r\nthe role and effectiveness of the United Nations itself in the areas of \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n50 \r\n(Mr. Kaniu. Pakistan) \r\ninternational security, economic and social development and human rights. \r\nPakistan welcomes the renewed confidence reposed in the United Nations \r\nsecurity role by the major Powers. This is, indeed, as the Secretary-General \r\nhas said, a second chance for the international community to build the system \r\nof collective security envisaged in the Charter. . The Security Council can act \r\nas a credible deterrent to aggression against smaller and weaker States. \r\nWhere aggression does occur, the Council can be the agent for the rapid \r\nrestoration of peace and the redress of injustice. \r\nWhile the revival of the Security Council has already been celebrated, we \r\nmust acknowledge that its determination in responding to aggression has not \r\nbeen uniform. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, for instance, Serbian aggression \r\ncould have been checked more effectively. The Council\u0027s decisions will \r\npossess credibility only if they are perceived to be fair and \r\nnon-discriminatory, in strict conformity with the purposes and principles of \r\nthe United Nations Charter. The actions of the Security Council will gain \r\nsupport if its procedures and processes are democratic and transparent. We \r\nshould resist efforts to create new centres of privilege. \r\nWe broadly endorse the Secretary-General\u0027s recommendations in his report \r\nentitled \"An Agenda for Peace\" regarding the United Nations role in preventive \r\ndiplomacy, peace-making and peace-keeping. We particularly agree with him \r\nthat conflict-prone situations should be identified at an early stage and that \r\nthe United Nations should play an active role for their peaceful settlement. \r\nPakistan strongly endorses greater resort by Member States to the procedures \r\nfor mediation, conciliation and arbitration provided in Chapter VI of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n51 \r\n(Mr. Kanju. Pakistan) \r\nPakistan\u0027s participation in several United Nations peace-keeping \r\noperations reflects our unqualified support for United Nations peace-keeping \r\nactivities. As a gesture of solidarity with our brothers in Somalia, Pakistan \r\nhas provided the United Nations operation in Somalia with an infantry \r\nbattalion along with vehicles and equipment. Pakistan is prepared to \r\ndesignate specific units of its armed forces for rapid deployment in the \r\nservice of the United Nations. \r\nWe believe that the General Assembly must also be enabled to play a more \r\neffective role in the promotion both of international peace and security and \r\nof economic and social progress. Our agenda must be rationalized. The \r\ndecisions of the General Assembly must also gain in credibility and \r\nresponsibility. Member States should observe and implement all resolutions of \r\nthe General Assembly, especially those which are adopted by consensus. \r\nThe Charter envisaged that the United Nations would play a central role \r\nin promoting economic and social progress and development. The world \r\nOrganization now reguires even greater support in order to be able to respond \r\nto the host of new global issues confronting mankind population, \r\nenvironment, drugs and international migration. The response of the United \r\nNations membership to these issues will shape the political, economic and \r\nsocial structures of the twenty-first century. \r\nThe United Nations will lose its second chance to realize its potential \r\nif it continues to be denied the financial resources required to discharge its \r\ngrowing responsibilities. At this Assembly, we should give serious \r\nconsideration to ways and means of ensuring adequate financing for all the \r\nactivities of the United Nations. \r\nIt is the hope of the Pakistan delegation that the forty-seventh session \r\nof the General Assembly will adopt an action plan for peace and prosperity. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n52 \r\n(Mr. Kanju. Pakistan) \r\nWe should endeavour to reach specific decisions to restructure international \r\nrelations by the fiftieth anniversary session of the General Assembly. This \r\nwould be an appropriate occasion to launch the world Organization on its \r\njourney towards the vision of peace, justice and progress reflected in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. \r\nAt this critical session of our Assembly, we are very happy to have \r\nsomeone with your wide diplomatic experience and wisdom as its President. I \r\nam confident that you will make a vital contribution to the success of our \r\ndeliberations on the major issues of our time. Your predecessor. \r\nAmbassador Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, has established a superb record of \r\nachievements, for which I would like to congratulate him warmly. \r\nOur Organization is most fortunate to have a new Secretary-General who, \r\nwith his distinguished academic and diplomatic experience, can comprehend the \r\nstrong currents of history flowing in these times. He has already manifested \r\nhis political courage in defence of justice, equity and peace. The Pakistan \r\ndelegation reposes full confidence in the ability of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali \r\nto guide the membership of the United Nations towards the new era of peace and \r\nprosperity which we all wish to see emerge from the debris of the cold war. \r\nMr. WATANABE (Japan) (spoke in Japanese; English text furnished by \r\nthe delegation): I should like, first of all, to extend my sincere \r\ncongratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of \r\nthe forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. At the same time, I wish \r\nto express to Mr. Samir Shihabi my appreciation for what was accomplished \r\nunder his presidency. His visit to Japan in April 1992 further strengthened \r\nmy country\u0027s close ties to the United Nations. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n53 \r\n(Mr. Watanabe. Japan) \r\nLast year, seven nations were admitted to membership in the United \r\nNations, and this year, another thirteen became Members. On behalf of the \r\nGovernment and people of Japan, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the \r\nrepresentatives of the nations attending this General Assembly for the first \r\ntime. Now numbering 179 Members, the United Nations is indeed a global \r\nOrganization. At the same time, its role in maintaining world peace and \r\nsecurity is increasing dramatically, thus presenting the international \r\ncommunity with unparalleled opportunities for realizing the ideals of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. \r\nMember States have extremely high expectations of the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Boutros-Ghali, who bears the awesome burdens of his office at a \r\nparticularly crucial juncture. I take this opportunity to pledge Japan\u0027s full \r\nsupport for, and cooperation with, President Ganev and Secretary-General \r\nBoutros-Ghali as we pursue our common goals. \r\nNow, nearly half a century after the United Nations was founded, the \r\ninternational community has been freed from the constraints of East-West \r\nconfrontation based on ideology and force. Nevertheless, this post-cold-war \r\nworld faces problems arising from the changing power relationship between the \r\nnations that dominated the old international order, the resurgence of \r\nregionalism, and the destabilization of regions by ethnic, religious and other \r\nstrife. \r\nThe Gulf crisis showed the high political and economic costs of restoring \r\npeace once it has been destroyed. Every day, countless refugees in what used \r\nto be Yugoslavia are being forced to flee their homes. Every day brings \r\nnumerous reports of atrocities there. In Somalia, the civil war, compounded \r\nby severe drought, is resulting in untold human suffering. Urgent efforts \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n54-55 \r\n(Mr. Watanabe. Japan) \r\ncontinue to be required to overcome poverty in many developing nations, home \r\nto the majority of the world\u0027s population. The preservation of the global \r\nenvironment for our children and grandchildren is another issue that demands \r\nour serious attention. \r\nThese challenges only underscore the need to seek solutions to problems \r\nin a spirit of conciliation and cooperation among nations. This conciliatory \r\nand cooperative spirit should be a key element in advancing us towards the \r\ncreation of an international order for the new era while the United Nations \r\nassumes even greater importance as the centre of our endeavours. Thus the \r\ntime has come to review the roles and functions of the United Nations and \r\nseriously to consider how they may be strengthened, and to reflect upon how \r\neach of its Members might best contribute to that end. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n56 \r\n(Mr. Watanabe. Japan) \r\nThe Security Council summit meeting held in January 1992 provided an \r\nunprecedented opportunity to examine, at the level of Head of State or \r\nGovernment, the problems confronting the international community. In the \r\nlight of the present world situation, the Secretary-General\u0027s report entitled \r\n\"An Agenda for Peace\", which was drafted on the basis of the deliberations at \r\nthe summit, is indeed a timely contribution. I hold Secretary-General \r\nBoutros-Ghali\u0027s initiative, which was realized with the diligent assistance of \r\nthe Secretariat, in the highest regard. \r\nIn Japan\u0027s view, building a peaceful world will require the following \r\nfive-pronged approach. \r\nFirst, efforts must be made to ease international tensions. The \r\nagreement reached at the summit meeting between the United States and Russia \r\nthis past June to make substantial reductions in nuclear armaments is most \r\nwelcome. It is hoped that this will lead to progress in nuclear disarmament \r\nby all nuclear-weapon States. The problem of proliferation demands that the \r\nregime of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons be \r\nstrengthened and made more universal. The Treaty\u0027s signatories should \r\nharmonize their positions so that when they meet in 1995 the smooth extension \r\nof the Treaty will be ensured. \r\nAn important facet of non-proliferation is the provision of employment \r\nassistance to weapons scientists of the former Soviet Union. To this end, \r\nJapan is striving to make it possible for an international science and \r\ntechnology centre to begin operation promptly in cooperation with the United \r\nStates and countries of the European Community. \r\nThe conclusion of negotiations on the chemical weapons convention at the \r\nConference on Disarmament and the anticipated submission to the General \r\nAssembly at the current session of the draft convention on the prohibition of \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n57 \r\n(Mr. Watanabe. Japan) \r\nchemical weapons constitute an epochal step forward. Japan earnestly hopes \r\nthat as many nations as possible will be original signatories to this \r\nconvention. \r\nConventional weapons are another area in which the vigilance of concerned \r\nnations is called for to prevent regional destabilization, especially in the \r\nlight of the major arms transfers that have already taken place in some \r\nregions. To increase the transparency of arms transfers and thereby \r\nstrengthen trust among nations, it is important that the United Nations \r\nRegister of Conventional Arms, the establishment of which Japan proposed \r\njointly with the European Community and other countries last year, be \r\nimplemented effectively. Japan and its partners in this effort plan to submit \r\na draft resolution to the General Assembly at this session calling for the \r\nwide participation of Member States in the Register. \r\nSecondly, stepped-up efforts are needed to forestall the outbreak of \r\nconflicts. Thus far, Japan has played an active role in the adoption of such \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions as the Declaration on conflict prevention (43/51) \r\nand the Declaration on United Nations fact-finding (46/59). To strengthen the \r\nconflict-prevention function of the United Nations, the Secretary-General must \r\nhave the capacity, inter alia, to conduct fact-finding missions, to issue \r\nearly warnings and to monitor constantly the situation in potential conflict \r\nzones. For this purpose, it is important that information about conflicts be \r\nmade immediately available to the Secretary-General. \r\nIn addition, I propose that there be set up within the United Nations \r\nSecretariat a conflict-information clearing-house. This office would collate \r\ninformation on conflicts collected through the fact-finding activities of the \r\nSecretariat or provided by Governments, and would present it in an objective \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n58 \r\n(Mr. Watanabe. Japan) \r\nmanner to the Security Council and to Member States so as to help them \r\nformulate their judgments on the situation. \r\nI should also note here that Japan is in basic agreement with the concept \r\nof preventive diplomacy described in the Secretary-General\u0027s report, but the \r\nidea of preventive deployment of United Nations peace-keeping operations, for \r\nexample, with the consent of only one party to a conflict involves problems \r\nwhich reguire further study. \r\nThirdly, stronger diplomatic efforts should be made by Members of the \r\nUnited Nations to resolve conflicts peacefully. Considering the recent spate \r\nof regional conflicts, efforts to resolve them by regional organizations and \r\nUnited Nations Member States are increasingly essential. The efforts led by \r\nthe European Community to restore peace in the former Yugoslavia and the \r\nefforts by the countries in the Asian region and the five permanent members of \r\nthe Security Council to restore peace in Cambodia are examples of the kind of \r\naction to which I refer. The steps now being taken by the countries concerned \r\ntowards peace in the Middle East also deserve to be hailed. Japan, for its \r\npart, also intends to play an active role in the multilateral consultations. \r\nI intend to see that Japan continues to step up its diplomatic efforts to \r\nbuild peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. As far as peace in \r\nCambodia is concerned, Japan has been playing an active role by, for example, \r\nhosting the Ministerial Meeting on the Reconstruction and Rehabilitation of \r\nCambodia in Tokyo this past June. In cooperation with other countries, Japan \r\nwill continue its intensive and unremitting efforts to urge the Khmer Rouge to \r\nwork with the other parties in Cambodia and with the United Nations \r\nTransitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) to advance the peace process \r\nquickly. Japan also intends to take an active part in the Security Council \r\ndeliberations on this issue. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n59-60 \r\n(Mr. Watanabe. Japan) \r\nEasing tensions on the Korean peninsula is of vital importance for peace \r\nand stability in east Asia, and Japan intends to contribute in every way it \r\ncan to the creation of an environment conducive to dialogue between South and \r\nNorth Korea. In this connection, Japan welcomes the establishment of \r\ndiplomatic relations between China and the Republic of Korea and hopes that \r\nthis will lead to ever-broader exchanges between the two countries in the \r\nfuture. \r\nI welcome the idea mentioned by President Roh Tae Woo of the Republic of \r\nKorea in his address earlier today of enhancing opportunities for dialogue \r\namong interested countries in north-east Asia, an idea that is consistent with \r\nJapan\u0027s own thinking. I consider it vitally important for Japan\u0027s \r\nrelationship with its neighbour, the Russian Federation, to expand in all \r\naspects on a balanced basis. In this connection, I believe that the building \r\nof a relationship of trust between Japan and Russia through the conclusion of \r\na peace treaty will greatly contribute to peace and stability in the region. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n61 \r\n(Mr. Watanabe. Japan) \r\nFourthly, peace-keeping operations, which are at the very centre of the \r\nprimary role of the United Nations, should be strengthened. Extending to new \r\nareas of responsibility, and with an ever-greater range of activity, United \r\nNations peace-keeping operations have evolved both gualitatively and \r\nquantitatively in recent years. As mentioned in the Secretary-General\u0027s \r\nreport, however, they are confronted with many problems, including increased \r\ndemands for funding and a shortage of logistical personnel. More active \r\ncooperation by Member States of the United Nations is therefore essential. \r\nLast June, the Japanese Diet passed the International Peace Cooperation \r\nLaw, which put in place domestic arrangements that finally enable Japan to \r\nparticipate in United Nations peace-keeping operations and international \r\nhumanitarian relief operations. In addition to the financial contributions it \r\nhas thus far extended, Japan intends to cooperate by sending personnel to the \r\nmaximum degree allowed within the framework of this new law. \r\nIn fact, a decision has already been made to send election monitors to \r\nthe United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II) in Angola to \r\noversee the elections there, and to send military observers, a construction \r\nunit and civilian police to the United Nations Transition Authority in \r\nCambodia (UNTAC). The first teams have already been dispatched. Japan also \r\nplans to send election monitors to Cambodia for the elections scheduled there \r\nnext year. \r\nJapan believes that the principles and practices of peace-keeping \r\noperations upheld by the United Nations for more than 40 years are still both \r\nappropriate and valid today and will continue to be so in the future. The \r\nidea of \"peace-enforcement units\", proposed in the Secretary-General\u0027s report, \r\noffers an interesting approach to future peace-making efforts of the United \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n62 \r\n(Mr. Watanabe. Japan) \r\nNations, but requires further study because it is rooted in a mode of thinking \r\ncompletely different from past peace-keeping forces. \r\nFifthly, in order to build peace throughout the world, dialogue and \r\ncooperation should be strengthened and developed as appropriate to the \r\nsituation in each region. Europe\u0027s regional cooperation mechanisms, typified \r\nby the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), have grown out \r\nof efforts for confidence-building against a backdrop of past conflicts. They \r\nhave evolved into frameworks for working together to achieve regional \r\nstability and prosperity, and have begun to work to prevent conflicts and \r\naugment their peace-keeping capability in specific ways. \r\nRegional cooperation for peace and prosperity in other parts of the world \r\nhas not yet matured to the same degree as in Europe. Ways should be explored \r\nto achieve forms of dialogue and cooperation that are well grounded in the \r\npolitical and geopolitical characteristics of each region and tailored to its \r\nneeds. \r\nWith respect to security in the Asia-Pacific region, Japan considers it \r\nimportant to maintain and strengthen the frameworks for dealing with issues \r\neither bilaterally or among several countries concerned, and, simultaneously, \r\nto seek to promote region-wide dialogue. I believe that, at the present time, \r\none of the forums that has the greatest potential for such region-wide \r\ndialogue is the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) \r\nPost-Ministerial Conference. Japan suggested last year that this forum be \r\nused for political dialogue of the type to which I am referring. In an effort \r\nto promote greater cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region which at the same \r\ntime is open to the outside world, Japan has been contributing actively to the \r\ndevelopment of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n63 \r\n(Mr. Watanabe. Japan) \r\nI should now like to turn to the question of responding to new threats. \r\nThe threats facing humankind today are not all military. Problems relating to \r\nthe deterioration of the global environment, refugees, poverty, \r\noverpopulation, drugs, AIDS and other threats of a non-military nature are \r\nbecoming increasingly serious. It is not enough simply to treat the symptoms; \r\nthe United Nations and the international community must join hands to remove \r\nthe causes of these ills. It is no exaggeration to say that the solution to \r\nthese problems will demand the utmost of humanity\u0027s collective knowledge and \r\nthe application of its highest ethical and moral standards. \r\nIn this connection, I wish to re-emphasize the importance of respect for \r\nhuman rights. Fundamental human rights are not only a universally cherished \r\nvalue, but are also fundamental to ensuring a better life for each individual \r\nand the development of a democratic society. The lack of respect for \r\nhumanitarian law and for the rights of minorities in recent conflict areas is \r\ndeeply disturbing. \r\nWith the end of the cold war, it is incumbent upon the international \r\ncommunity to grapple more seriously with the problem of poverty in the \r\ndeveloping world, since the maintenance of world order hinges largely upon \r\nwhether and to what degree the North and South cooperate. The United Nations \r\nmust redouble its efforts to combat poverty and to eliminate the causes of \r\nsocial instability - which is rooted in poverty in the recognition that \r\neconomic development raises standards of living and thereby enhances political \r\nstability. \r\nIn addressing the issue of poverty, we must bear in mind that conditions \r\ndiffer from country to country. The economies of some countries are about to \r\ntake off, others are on the verge of solving their spiralling debt problems, \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n64-65 \r\n(Mr. Watanabe. Japan) \r\nand others such as the sub-Saharan countries are still experiencing \r\ncrushing economic difficulties. We must therefore search for an approach that \r\nis finely tuned to these differing circumstances. \r\nJapan intends to assist United Nations efforts to deal more effectively \r\nwith these problems that affect all of humanity. For example, cognizant of \r\nits role as a responsible member of the international community, Japan plans \r\nto host an African development conference in autumn next year in Tokyo with \r\nthe cooperation and participation of sub-Saharan nations, major aid donors, \r\nthe United Nations and other international agencies to discuss the theme of \r\neconomic development in Africa. Another timely event that addresses these \r\nproblems is the United Nations social development summit, scheduled for 1995. \r\nJapan intends to cooperate actively in both these meetings to ensure that they \r\nwill be genuinely fruitful. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n66 \r\n(Mr. Watanabe, Japan) \r\nI turn now to the subject of the environment and development. It is very \r\nimportant that the follow-up to the United Nations Conference on Environment \r\nand Development, held recently in Rio de Janeiro, be maintained. Japan \r\nintends to make active contributions to the work of the sustainable \r\ndevelopment committee, the establishment of which is on the agenda of this \r\nGeneral Assembly session, and of such international environmental agencies as \r\nthe United Nations Environment Programme and the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme. The process of making the necessary domestic arrangements is now \r\nunder way. Japan will soon finalize the draft of its national action \r\nprogramme, and is prepared to assist developing countries in the formulation \r\nof theirs. In accordance with its stated goal that its environment-related \r\nofficial development assistance be increased to between 900 billion and \r\n1 trillion yen over the next five years, Japan will strive to identify, \r\nformulate and implement the best projects through policy dialogue with \r\ndeveloping countries. At this stage I wish to confirm Japan\u0027s proposal that a \r\nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to environmental issues, as a \r\nfollow-up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, be \r\nheld before 1997. \r\nWhereas refugees are returning to their homes in Cambodia and other parts \r\nof the world, the refugee problem in the former Yugoslavia and in Somalia \r\nremains extremely serious. The international community must unite to address \r\nsuch complex problems as shelter, emergency aid, and assistance in \r\nreintegrating refugees following their voluntary return home. Japan will \r\ncontinue to be active in extending humanitarian aid through the office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other international agencies. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n67 \r\n(Mr. Watanabe. Japan) \r\nPopulation is another problem facing all humankind - a problem that \r\ndemands the cooperation of both developed and developing countries. Japan \r\nwishes, in preparation for the 1994 world population and development \r\nconference, and with the cooperation of the United Nations Fund for Population \r\nActivities and the United Nations University, to hold in 1994 a meeting of \r\neminent world authorities on demographic issues, and in this regard we \r\nsincerely ask for the cooperation of Member States. \r\nI wish to refer now to steps towards revitalization of the United \r\nNations. The United Nations is currently faced with a number of structural \r\nproblems. These relate to its organization which has not adapted fully to \r\nthe changing times to the serious budget crisis, and to the insufficiency of \r\ncommunication between United Nations agencies. \r\nFirst, the most serious requirement of the United Nations as a global \r\nOrganization today is legitimacy, trustworthiness and efficacy. If the United \r\nNations is to realize the ideals and purposes of the Charter - based on \r\nlegitimacy, trustworthiness and efficacy including the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, it must have the complete confidence of its \r\nMembers. In this respect, the United Nations must reshape itself in response \r\nto the epochal changes that we have recently witnessed changes that could \r\nnot have been foreseen when the Organization was founded. These include the \r\nrapid transformations in the international situation, the dramatic increase in \r\nUnited Nations membership and shifts in global power relations. \r\nHowever, the United Nations Charter itself still contains historical \r\nrelics, such as the former-enemies clauses. And the way in which the \r\nOrganization is structured makes one question whether it can effectively meet \r\nexpectations. With the aim, in part, of enhancing trust in, and the efficacy \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n68-70 \r\n(Mr. Watanabe. Japan) \r\nof, the Security Council, which has a particularly important role in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, Japan believes that it is \r\nnecessary to consider seriously just how the United Nations as a whole should \r\nbe structured. This effort should include consideration of the functions, \r\ncomposition and other aspects of the Security Council. In my view, it is \r\nnecessary for the United Nations itself to begin to deal with this issue with \r\na view to strengthening its functions. The year 1995, which will be the \r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Organization, may prove to be an important \r\njuncture in the process of addressing this issue. The re-examination of the \r\nstructure of the United Nations should also be accompanied by reform of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, which plays a role as important as that of the \r\nSecurity Council. The discussions on the Economic and Social Council that are \r\ncurrently being held in this direction are a welcome development. \r\nThe second crisis facing the United Nations is that of the budget \r\ndeficit. The United Nations is on the verge of bankruptcy. If it is to \r\nemerge from its chronic shortage of funds. Member States must honour their \r\nobligations and immediately pay their assessed contributions. It is \r\nimperative that those Member States that are in arrears pay what they owe. \r\nThe rapidly increasing demand for funds to finance peace-keeping operations \r\nmust, in the light of the importance of these operations, be met. In \r\nparticular, the availability of funding at the start-up stage of an operation \r\nis of crucial.importance and could determine the outcome of the operation as a \r\nwhole. Japan therefore plans to put before the General Assembly at the \r\ncurrent session a draft resolution to ensure that the financial requirements \r\nof major peace-keeping operations at the start-up stage will be met without \r\nimposing new financial burdens on Member States. I sincerely hope that this \r\ndraft resolution will receive wide support from Member States. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n71 \r\n(Mr. Watanabe. Japan) \r\nThe third problem concerns insufficient communication among United \r\nNations agencies. Better communication among the component agencies of the \r\nUnited Nations is necessary to ensure that the limited resources of the United \r\nNations are used effectively and that the Organization\u0027s full potential is \r\nrealized. Specifically, it is important to improve liaison between the \r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council, and communication \r\nbetween the Security Council and the General Assembly. The establishment, for \r\nexample, of a mechanism for periodic exchanges of view and close contact \r\nbetween and among the Presidents of the Security Council, the Economic and \r\nSocial Council, and the General Assembly either two or three at a time \r\nshould be considered. Furthermore, it is important for the Economic and \r\nSocial Council to have access to, and to provide the Security Council with, \r\ninformation as provided in Article 65 of the Charter. Finally, whenever a \r\nmajor peace-keeping operation is undertaken that will entail a major financial \r\ncommitment, it is essential that there be established a mechanism for \r\nconsultations among the permanent members of the Security Council, the major \r\nsources of financial support, the countries providing large contingents of \r\noperations personnel and the countries of the regions concerned. \r\nThe United Nations is entering an era of greater potential than it has \r\never experienced in its history of nearly half a century. This is also a \r\ntime, however, that will test whether the United Nations can evolve into a \r\nglobal organization with the capability to achieve peace and prosperity for \r\nall humankind. The very magnitude of the challenges and tasks that lie ahead \r\ndemand that now, more than ever before, each Member State be keenly aware of \r\nits responsbilities and carry its share of the burden. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n72 \r\n(Mr. Watanabe. Japan) \r\nAttaching central importance to the United Nations, and committed to \r\nits own ideals as a peace-loving State, Japan is determined to contribute \r\nto the international community in a manner that is commensurate with its \r\nposition and responsibilities in terms not only of financial resources \r\nbut also of personnel and by enhancing its political role in the effort \r\nto build a new order of peace. And as a non-permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council, Japan is striving to bring about a more peaceful world. \r\nI should like to conclude with the pledge that I shall do my utmost \r\nto see that Japan, in a spirit of conciliation and cooperation, continues \r\nto enhance its active contributions to the international community. \r\nMr. SKUBISZEWSKI (Poland): Please accept my congratulations, \r\nSir, on your election to the presidency of the current session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. I wish you every success in carrying out this \r\nresponsible task. Let me also add how glad we are to have a President \r\npersonifying the democratic transformation in Central and Eastern Europe. \r\nTo the outgoing President, Ambassador Samir S. Shihabi of the Kingdom \r\nof Saudi Arabia, I convey our appreciation for the quality of his \r\nleadership and work. \r\nI also want to assure the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, of our unfailing support for his tireless \r\nefforts to make the United Nations live up to the expectations of our time \r\nand to the law of the Charter. \r\nIt is with profound satisfaction that we welcome in our midst the new \r\nMembers of the United Nations: San Marino, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Armenia, \r\nKyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia, \r\nas well as Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n73 \r\n(Mr. Skubiszewski. Poland) \r\nThe end of the cold war has opened up the possibility of building a world \r\norder free from nuclear terror based on mutual respect among nations, on \r\ngreater equality of opportunity, and on effective cooperative structures. It \r\nhas raised hopes for a safer, more equitable and more humane world. Yet we \r\nare still far from turning those hopes into reality. \r\nConseguently, the international community is led to re-examine and adjust \r\nthe structures and functions of the United Nations. Member States are \r\nthinking more and more in terms of stimulating efforts to enhance the \r\neffectiveness and efficiency of the Organization. In the words of the \r\nSecretary-General, they should seek the \"transfiguration of the house\". Our \r\nfiftieth anniversary will offer an appropriate occasion to reassess the \r\nstructure of the Organization with a view to tapping the full potential of the \r\nCharter. Before we talk about its revision, we first need to re-read the \r\nCharter in an attempt to implement it consistently and to adapt its \r\napplication to the post-cold-war realities and to the political and socio-\r\neconomic challenges originating form the South-North relationship.* \r\nImportant suggestions have been made by the Secretary-General in his \r\nimaginative report \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277). We welcome this document \r\nand the proposals contained therein. \r\nInternational security is a multidimensional issue. While the military \r\nfactor continues to play its key role, security and stability are becoming \r\nincreasingly dependent on other factors as well. \r\n* Mr. Phoofolo (Lesotho), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n74-75 \r\n(Mr. Skubiszewski. Poland) \r\nWe are facing pressing tasks in the economic area: the economies of the \r\ndeveloping countries and the economies of the newly democratic countries, \r\nwhich emerged with the fall of communism, must become more efficient. There \r\nare enormous challenges with regard to the protection of the environment, with \r\nregard to the refugee question, and with regard to natural and man-made \r\ndisasters. The issue of refugees represents an external manifestation of \r\nproblems which cannot be addressed effectively without first attending to \r\ntheir underlying causes. The dramatic plight of famine- stricken Somalia is a \r\nmanifest example. It calls not only for urgent international relief but also \r\nfor long-standing assistance. \r\nThe advance made in arms control and in disarmament has a direct and \r\npositive impact on the international security climate. Over the last \r\n12 months, negotiations in this vital area resulted, amongst other things, in \r\nthe Open Skies Treaty, the agreements between the United States and the four \r\nsuccessor States of the former USSR (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan) \r\nrelating to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), and the Convention on \r\nthe Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of \r\nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. The Conference on Disarmament in \r\nGeneva must be commended for having finally reached an agreement to ban these \r\nabhorrent weapons. The States participating in the Conference on Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE) have committed themselves to become original \r\nsignatories to that important instrument. We urge all Member States to do \r\nlikewise. \r\nA/477PV.7 \r\n76 \r\n(Mr. Skubiszewski. Poland) \r\nHowever, arms control and disarmament are unfinished tasks. The United \r\nNations has to deal with the overkill capacity still present in arsenals, both \r\nnuclear and conventional, and with the growing danger of the spread of weapons \r\nof mass destruction and missile technology. There is an immediate need to \r\ncontrol international arms transfers. Openness and transparency in the \r\nmilitary field have to be promoted. Military stability and confidence will be \r\nelusive unless we make headway in all these areas. But even that is not \r\nenough. International peace and security will at best remain fragile as long \r\nas prevailing patterns and practices are not redressed to eliminate the \r\nnon-military causes of instability, including ethnic hatred and nationalism. \r\nThe crisis in the former Yugoslavia, and especially in Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, stands out at present as the single greatest breach of \r\ninternational peace. It is a threat to the security of the region. \r\nNon-compliance with the law of armed conflict; the atrocities; persecution of \r\nvarious population groups, including forced resettlement and \"ethnic \r\ncleansing\" programmes; gross violations of human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms; obstacles put in the way of humanitarian aid, including obstacles to \r\nthe activity of the International Committee of the Red Cross - all these acts \r\nunderlie a regional conflict of unprecedented proportions which is brimming \r\nwith spill-over risks and incalculable conseguences. \r\nThe recent report of Mr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Special Rapporteur of the \r\nCommission on Human Rights, contains stark evidence of breaches of \r\ninternational humanitarian law and human rights. The report leaves no party \r\nto the conflict blameless, while recognizing that the degrees of \r\nresponsibility are far from being equal or even comparable. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n77 \r\n(Mr. Skubiszewski. Poland) \r\nIn view of the reports on civilian and prisoner-of-war detention camps, \r\nthe Polish Government deems it necessary to reiterate its demand of 7 August \r\nthis year that all such camps be closed down forthwith and all the detainees \r\nbe released without delay. Moreover, criminal prosecution of all persons \r\nresponsible for breaches of the law of armed conflict must be ensured. \r\nPoland has contributed one of the largest contingents to the United \r\nNations Transition Authority in Cambodia and to the United Nations Protection \r\nForce in former Yugoslavia. At the same time/ Poland recognizes the urgent \r\nneed of reassessment of the tasks and structure of United Nations \r\npeace-keeping forces, including - as proposed by the Secretary-General the \r\nestablishment of a standing force at the disposal of the Organization. Another \r\nsubject which deserves examination is the financing of the peace-keeping \r\noperations out of the defence budgets of States. The earmarking of merely \r\nhalf a per cent of their annual military expenditures for peace-keeping \r\noperations would help to overcome the present budgetary constraints. In this \r\nway, the maintenance of peace and security would become a truly common \r\nresponsibility of the international community. \r\nPoland stands ready to contribute to the development of international \r\ncentres for preparing peace-keeping forces. To this end we propose to make \r\navailable to the United Nations one of the military bases in Poland vacated by \r\nthe Russian armed forces. \r\nLet me also stress at this juncture that the Government of Poland has \r\nindicated its willingness to assign to peace-keeping operations, as of 1993, \r\ntwo or three self-contained infantry battalions, in addition to logistics \r\ndetachments. This contingent could eventually be made available to the \r\nSecurity Council on a permanent basis. We thus fully agree with words that \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n78 \r\n(Mr. Skubiszewski. Poland) \r\nthe President of the United States of America uses in his address to us \r\nyesterday namely, that a new emphasis should be put on peace-keeping. That \r\nidea has also been entertained by other speakers. Furthermore, in response to \r\na recent suggestion by the Secretary-General, Poland stands ready to \r\nparticipate in consultations aimed at the implementation of Article 43 of the \r\nCharter. \r\nI shall now address the issue of regionalism. Some points have already \r\nbeen raised during today\u0027s debate. I am referring in particular to the \r\nstatements by the British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth \r\nAffairs and by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands. \r\nMember States should make more use of the opportunities inherent in \r\nChapter VIII of the Charter. Regional and continental security structures \r\nshould become, in our view, part of a global security architecture. \r\nThe aggression against Kuwait and the hostilities in former Yugoslavia, \r\nin Moldova and in Nagorno-Karabakh have laid bare the strength of nationalism \r\nand the weakness of some regional structures. Indeed, left to fester, \r\npolitical, ethnic, religious and other conflicts have spread insecurity and \r\ninstability across Europe and far beyond. While the United Nations is, as \r\nproved by the Persian Gulf experience, capable of playing its role in regard \r\nto the restoration and then preservation of peace and security, we still need \r\nto seek new security arrangements in keeping with the Charter. In Europe, \r\nthis need has already been recognized by the North Atlantic Alliance, which is \r\nthe pillar of security in our continent, the Western European Union and the \r\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Poland supports \r\ntheir involvement and active cooperation with other institutions in \r\npeace-keeping, conflict prevention and crisis management. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n79 \r\n(Mr. Skubiszewski. Poland) \r\nHarmonious and constructive interaction between the United Nations and \r\nregional organizations or arrangements may well constitute an important new \r\nelement in making the United Nations more effective in the field of peace and \r\nsecurity. This fact is rightly emphasized by the Secretary-General in his \r\nreport. \r\nIn crisis situations, where several organizations are acting \r\nsimultaneously, it could be advisable to set up, on an ad-hoc basis, a single \r\ncoordinating framework. This would help to avoid duplication, overlapping or \r\ndissipation of efforts. \r\nThe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe should be commended \r\nfor its offer of such cooperation. It declared itself a regional arrangement \r\nin the sense of Chapter VIII of the Charter. This implies the establishment \r\nof an important link between European and global security. \r\nIn our concern for peace and security we must consider the non-military \r\nfactors. Let me turn first to human rights, an area where the Polish nation \r\nhas accumulated considerable experience of internal struggle for the respect \r\nof the individual. Our debate on this issue is taking place at a time of both \r\nrising expectations and mounting fears about future developments. The \r\ninternational community is frustrated by its far-too-frequent helplessness in \r\ncases of grave and massive violations of human rights. Former Yugoslavia is a \r\nrecent case in point. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n80 \r\n(Mr. Skubiszewski. Poland) \r\nThe United Nations should urgently consider additional measures to \r\naddress serious violations of human rights among other things, a system of \r\nenforcement of respect for human rights. In this connection, the Austrian \r\nproposal concerning the establishment of a human rights emergency mechanism, \r\nsubmitted to the Commission on Human Rights, deserves proper attention. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n81 \r\n(Mr. Skubiszewski. Poland) \r\nThe forthcoming World Conference on Human Rights is an appropriate forum \r\nto discuss these guestions. The Conference should adopt a comprehensive \r\napproach to human rights. It should elaborate an action-oriented programme \r\nfor the promotion and implementation of human rights as well as for the \r\nprevention of their violation. It should contribute to improving the \r\ncoordination of United Nations activities in that respect. The framework for \r\nthe preparations for the Conference is provided by General Assembly \r\nresolution 45/155. \r\nWhile noting the variety of factors which influence the status of human \r\nrights, the resolution places emphasis on their universality. There is no \r\njustification for any differentiation in understanding the contents and the \r\nmeaning of human rights, nor is there any room for their selective \r\napplication. We must do all in our power to prevent the weakening of the \r\nuniversal substance of human rights. \r\nMy country pays particular attention to the protection of minorities. \r\nThis attitude has found its expression in the treaties concluded by Poland \r\nwith its neighbours. We fully endorse the adoption by the General Assembly of \r\nthe draft declaration on the rights of persons belonging to national, ethnic, \r\nreligious and linguistic minorities. \r\nWhile the ideologically motivated East-West division no longer \r\nexists and we rejoice at that we now see a growing North-South division, \r\nwith the countries in transition, such as Poland, stranded in between. As a \r\nresult, the promise of peace, greater security and freedom for all is being \r\nslowly eroded. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n82 \r\n(Mr. Skubiszewski. Poland) \r\nGlobal inequality, exemplified by the widening gap between the rich North \r\nand the poor South as well as the disparity in access to markets, must be \r\nalleviated not only for economic, but also for security, humanitarian and \r\nethical reasons. Ecologically sustainable development, with democracy and the \r\nmarket economy at its core, should be the focal point and the principal goal \r\nof the United Nations system as it prepares itself for the future: the year \r\n2000 and beyond. We shall not be able to cope successfully with the \r\nchallenges ahead unless a coalition for development is forged. \r\nAs it happens, there are also grounds to fear a division based on the \r\nlevel of economic development in Europe. In the case of countries in \r\ntransition, their long-awaited prosperity is lagging behind, not coming \r\nhand-in-hand with freedom. The Western industrial democracies have not yet \r\nadopted a coherent approach to the emerging problems of countries in Central \r\nand Eastern Europe. A grand strategy for supporting the democratic transition \r\nhas not yet been worked out, a strategy whose relevance, I dare say, may well \r\none day be highly appreciated in other regions and countries likely to face \r\ntransition and transformation problems. \r\nThere is little doubt that international economic relations need to be \r\nreformed in the overriding interest of international stability and security. \r\nThe stronger the economy, the sturdier the political and social fabric of \r\nStates and, in effect, the greater their resistance to the impact of ethnic \r\nconflicts, refugee exoduses and migration problems. This, I believe, is a \r\nvalid argument in favour of accelerated restructuring of the economies in \r\ntransition and their early integration into the world economy. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n83 \r\n(Mr. Skubiszewski. Polanjj \r\nThe social implications of economic reform and structural adjustment need \r\nto be carefully monitored, both in the developing countries and in those in \r\ntransition. We expect that the forthcoming United Nations Summit Conference \r\non social policies and development will address these implications in some \r\ndetail, especially as they relate to Central and Eastern Europe and the \r\nCommonwealth of Independent States. It would certainly be helpful if, in the \r\ncourse of preparations for the conference, the Secretary-General could \r\nprepare, by analogy with his report \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277), a report \r\non the challenges of social and economic development. \r\nPoland welcomes the fact that the United Nations Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro earlier this year, has \r\nopened a new chapter of international cooperation by addressing environmental \r\nprotection issues in a manner compatible with the reguirements of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\nThe Decade of International Law has got off to a slow start, yet it still \r\noffers a unique framework for enhancing the role of law as the basic factor \r\nfor order in international relations. We should not miss this opportunity. \r\nThe United Nations itself is facing a number of legal questions of a highly \r\nsensitive nature: Let me refer, by way of example, to the contemporary \r\nmeaning of sovereignty; the rule of law and domestic jurisdiction of States; \r\nrespect for international law in conflict situations; global legal mechanisms \r\nfor the enforcement of human rights; the establishment of an international \r\ncriminal court; succession of States; and international compensation claims. \r\nAs to the solution of conflicts, recourse should be made to Article 36 of \r\nthe Charter. Security Council recommendations on specific procedures or \r\nmethods of adjustment of disputes should become a normal practice in cases \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n84-85 \r\n(Mr. Skubiszewski. Poland) \r\nwhere parties to a dispute are unable to settle it in accordance with their \r\nobligations under paragraph 3 of Article 2. Poland is in favour, in \r\nparticular, of reinforcing the role of the International Court of Justice. \r\nI wish to conclude by noting that enduring world peace is inconceivable \r\nwithout law and justice standing out as unfaltering beacons for all men and \r\nnations alike.* \r\nMrs. AF UGGLAS (Sweden): I should like to offer you hearty \r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency. Sir. I am confident that \r\nthis session of the General Assembly is in good hands. I should also like to \r\npay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his \r\nleadership of the United Nations in an era of crucial change. \r\nIt is a sign of the times that since last year no fewer than 13 new \r\nMember States have taken their seats in the General Assembly. I should like \r\nto extend a warm welcome to them all. \r\nThe world is currently undergoing dramatic changes and facing great \r\nchallenges. Let us not allow the optimism inspired by the revolution which \r\nbrought freedom to Eastern Europe to turn into a new pessimism as a result of \r\nthe problems we are facing today. \r\nThe end of the cold war has definitely given us a unigue opportunity to \r\nbuild a new world order founded on common values, as originally envisaged in \r\nthe United Nations Charter. International consensus is emerging, based on the \r\nprinciples of democracy and a free economy as prerequisites for the prosperity \r\nof the peoples of the world. \r\nThe President returned to the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n86 \r\n(Mrs, af Ugglas. Sweden) \r\nThe first reason for my optimism is the end of the East-West conflict. \r\nThe second reason is that experience has shown that no nation is condemned to \r\na perpetual cycle of poverty, underdevelopment and political violence. \r\nSeveral developing countries have made remarkable progress from absolute \r\npoverty to relative prosperity in a very short time. \r\nIn addition to traditional contributions from the industrial countries, \r\nwe can observe a tendency for economically successful developing countries to \r\nshare their know-how and experience with other countries which have not yet \r\nachieved the same level of growth. New forms of cooperation between nations \r\nat different stages of development are emerging. \r\nWe are living in an era when the removal of the risk of a nuclear \r\nholocaust makes other threats to peace and security stand out all the more \r\nclearly. This applies to problems of economic development, to the growing \r\nthreat to the environment, and to ethnic and religious conflicts which have \r\nbecome severely aggravated in certain areas. Even though security will \r\ncontinue to have a military dimension, these challenges can be met only by \r\napplying a broader security concept which takes all aspects into account. \r\nIn the long term, problems and conflicts of this kind can be solved only \r\nin an environment where there is a greater focus on cooperation. This can be \r\nachieved through the free exchange of know-how and goods, through regional \r\ncooperation and through institution-building: the establishment and \r\nstrengthening of international structures within and outside the United \r\nNations system. In the future, the greatness of a nation will be measured not \r\nby its military potential but by its ability to create a civil society through \r\npeaceful cooperation. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n87 \r\n(Mrs, af Ugglas. Sweden) \r\nA world of open, civil societies must also be a world of open markets. \r\nIn Western Europe, peace and prosperity have been consolidated and secured \r\nthrough the free flow of goods and services. In the same way, peace and \r\nprosperity in what is usually termed the third world can be achieved only by \r\nglobal free trade and more open frontiers. \r\nWe in the West must do more than merely open up our markets. It is also \r\nour responsibility to support economic and social progress in the developing \r\ncountries by giving generous assistance. Assistance is particularly important \r\nfor the poorest countries which are not yet able to benefit fully from freer \r\nworld trade. \r\nSweden considers it essential that the Western industrial countries \r\nachieve the goal of allocating 0.7 per cent of their gross national income to \r\ndevelopment assistance. Development assistance must effectively promote \r\nrespect for human rights, democracy and market-economy solutions. \r\nUnfortunately, increasing resources are needed also to help people who are \r\nsuffering from famine, war and other disasters. \r\nRegional cooperation, which has been given new impetus following the end \r\nof East-West confrontation, will play an increasingly dynamic role in \r\ntomorrow\u0027s world. And, in its turn, regional cooperation can promote global \r\ncooperation. If opportunities for regional cooperation are utilized in the \r\nright manner, this cooperation will provide the bricks for building global \r\nintegration. But if these opportunities are not handled properly, the result \r\nwill be narrow-minded nationalism and economic protectionism. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n88 \r\n(Mrs, af Ugglas. Sweden) \r\nEuropean integration and the reunification of Eastern and Western Europe \r\non the basis of common values and aims have created new opportunities for \r\npan-European cooperation. Future stability depends on the success of the \r\ntransition in Eastern Europe and in the States of the Commonwealth of \r\nIndependent States, which makes demands on European solidarity. \r\nA united and successful Europe can play an important and positive role at \r\nthe international level. It is Sweden\u0027s firm intention to become a member of \r\nthe European Community. As a member, Sweden will continue to work for a \r\nEurope which is open to the world, economically, culturally and politically. \r\nIn our view, an introverted Europe is not a viable alternative. \r\nEnvironmental threats, natural disasters and terrorism will continue to \r\npresent us with formidable challenges. Mass poverty and accelerating \r\npopulation growth still trouble many countries. Drug use and drug trafficking \r\nremain major concerns for the international community. We have seen that \r\nsocieties can break down both as a result of domestic problems and under \r\nexternal pressure. \r\nIt is a fact that the massive flows of refugees which we see today are \r\njust as likely to be caused by human activities as by natural disasters. In \r\nEurope, we have been unable so far to stop the tragic developments in the \r\nformer Yugoslavia. This is the most brutal conflict experienced in our region \r\nsince the Second World War. Sweden is endeavouring to strengthen regional \r\nmechanisms and the international framework in order to deal with conflicts of \r\nthe type we have seen in the Balkans, in Moldavia and in the Caucasus. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n89 \r\n(Mrs, af Ugglas. Sweden) \r\nIn its own vicinity, Sweden has focused on the risk of conflict inherent \r\nin the unregulated stationing of former Soviet troops in the sovereign Baltic \r\nStates. We welcome the recent agreement on troop withdrawal reached by Russia \r\nand Lithuania and expect that similar agreements will be concluded with \r\nEstonia and Latvia as well. \r\nAlthough the end of the cold war has encouraged steps towards peaceful \r\nsolutions, regional conflicts, often of long standing, continue to claim \r\nvictims in many parts of the world. In parts of Africa, regional conflicts \r\nare aggravated by protracted drought, which has contributed to a famine \r\naffecting millions of people. No one can be indifferent to the situation in \r\nSomalia, where the civilian population has been hit harder than anywhere else. \r\nIn other parts of the Horn of Africa as well, the inhabitants are \r\nsuffering the effects of war. Sweden is participating in the ongoing \r\ninternational humanitarian relief measures by contributing substantial \r\nresources. However, humanitarian assistance must be combined with political \r\nefforts to establish a lasting peace. \r\nThe positive features of developments in South Africa, where important \r\nsteps have been taken towards a negotiated settlement, are overshadowed by \r\npolitical violence which is tending to create a vicious circle. The Swedish \r\nGovernment supports the efforts of the Secretary-General in contributing to an \r\nend to the violence and to resumed negotiations leading to the speedy \r\nabolishment of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic South Africa. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n90 \r\n(Mrs, af Ugglas. Sweden) \r\nThe historic opportunity to achieve peace which has now opened up in the \r\nMiddle East must not be lost. However, if peace is to have real content, \r\nthere must be a comprehensive settlement including all the aspects discussed \r\nby the multilateral working parties within the framework of the peace \r\nprocess. The Middle East could greatly benefit from regional cooperation in a \r\nnumber of areas. \r\nWhen the parties to a conflict sit down at the negotiating table, a \r\ndynamic process of confidence-building is often created. We hope that such \r\ndynamic effects will occur, both in the political process in South Africa and \r\nin the peace process in the Middle East. \r\nRecent developments in the disarmament area have been particularly \r\nhopeful. In the past year, the United States and the members of the \r\nCommonwealth of Independent States concerned agreed to cut back their \r\nstrategic nuclear stockpiles by two thirds and to eliminate most of their \r\ntactical nuclear weapons. \r\nThe draft convention on a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons \r\nrepresents a historic achievement in international efforts to prevent the \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We hope that growing \r\ninternational consensus will lead to further effective measures to deal with \r\nweapons of mass destruction and their proliferation. Sweden pays particular \r\nattention to the non-profileration of nuclear weapons and to the strengthening \r\nand indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons as a result of the 1995 Review Conference. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n91 \r\n(Mrs, af Ugglas. Sweden) \r\nAn important task for this session of the General Assembly is to follow \r\nup the decisions taken at the United Nations Conference on Environment and \r\nDevelopment in Rio de Janeiro in June. Industrial and developing countries \r\nmust work together in a spirit of cooperation and solidarity to deal with \r\nthreats to our environment and to achieve environmentally sound development. \r\nA Swedish poet once wrote: \"What force may create is uneasy and brief\". \r\nThis is also what history teaches. Lasting solutions to crises and conflicts \r\ncaused by political and religious antagonisms must be based on the principles \r\nof democracy and international law. It is therefore in everyone\u0027s interest to \r\nsafeguard the rule of international law, transcending national, ethnic, and \r\nreligious frontiers. \r\nIn Europe we have seen a welcome development of the Conference on \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). During the cold war the role of \r\nthe CSCE was to build bridges. Its central task now is to support the Eastern \r\nEuropean countries in their transition and to help these new States to find \r\nforms for peaceful coexistence. When Sweden assumes the chairmanship of the \r\nCSCE Council of Ministers in December, I intend to work for the further \r\nenhancement of the capacity of the CSCE to build peace and settle conflicts. \r\nCoordination between the United Nations and the CSCE was strengthened \r\nwhen the CSCE, in Helsinki, explicity pronounced itself a regional \r\norganization as defined in the United Nations Charter. This is having a \r\npositive effect, for example on endeavours to solve the conflict in former \r\nYugoslavia. Different forms of cooperative security between the United \r\nNations and regional organizations are also beinc introduced in other conflict \r\nareas. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n92 \r\n(Mrs, af Ugglas. Sweden) \r\nHowever, the United Nations has the fundamental responsibility for the \r\ninterpretation and application of international law. Enforcement measures \r\nremain the prerogative of the United Nations. But the United Nations must be \r\nstrengthened in important respects if it is to be able to meet the demands of \r\ntoday and the expectations of tomorrow. \r\nSweden wants to contribute to this process. In the first instance, the \r\npeace-making, peace-keeping and peace-building capacity of the United Nations \r\nmust be reinforced. This applies to the Security Council, which bears the \r\nmain responsibility for peace and security under the Charter. It also applies \r\nto the Secretary-General, who should be given greater possibilities for taking \r\ninitiatives. \r\nRegarding the strengthening of the Security Council, I am primarily \r\nthinking of the Council\u0027s possibilities for dealing with threats to \r\ninternational peace and security at an early stage. However, caution should \r\nbe exercised in changing the Council\u0027s composition and its decision-making \r\nprocedures, since the Council is now at long last functioning as the Charter \r\nintended. At the same time, it is important that the decisions of the \r\nSecurity Council continue to enjoy wide support from Member States. This \r\nrequires close cooperation between members of the Security Council and other \r\nMembers of the United Nations. \r\nSweden welcomes the Secretary-General\u0027s report \"An Agenda for Peace\". \r\nSeveral of the proposals presented in his report were discussed by the Nordic \r\ncountries in. an earlier document entitled: \"Shaping the Peace the United \r\nNations in the 1990s\". In this document we appealed for, among other things, \r\nstrengthening the Security Council\u0027s and the Secretary-General\u0027s capacities to \r\nundertake preventive diplomacy. It is gratifying to note that this issue has \r\nnow been given the highest priority. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n93 \r\n(Mrs, af Ugglas. Sweden) \r\nIt is of the utmost importance that the United Nations be given concrete \r\npossibilities for anticipating and preventing conflicts. It should be \r\npossible to deploy peace-keeping forces for preventive purposes. The parties \r\nto a conflict should be urged to apply to the International Court of Justice \r\nfor the peaceful settlement of their disputes. Violations of fundamental \r\nhuman rights can constitute a threat to international peace and security and \r\nhence be subject to measures by the Security Council. \r\nAs regards the difficult guestion of the use of coercive measures to keep \r\nor build peace under Article 42 of the Charter, and the establishment of \r\npermanent United Nations forces on a national basis for this purpose, we have \r\nevery reason carefully to follow and analyse these matters. Any change in \r\nUnited Nations practice must take place in the broadest possible agreement. \r\nThe Secretary-General\u0027s report also contains proposals for financing \r\ntraditional peace-keeping missions. The guestion of financing has become \r\nincreasingly important as United Nations peace-keeping endeavours have been \r\nextended. Peace-keeping activities must not be based on the charity of Member \r\ncountries, as has often been the case in the past. The Nordic countries have \r\nconcluded that the establishment of a contingency fund for peace-keeping \r\noperations would constitute an important step towards solving the question of \r\nfinancing. \r\nBut peace-keeping operations are only one aspect of the financing \r\ndifficulties of the United Nations. If the United Nations is to be capable of \r\nfulfilling its role in the future, now that the political prerequisites exist, \r\na long-term solution must be found for the Organization\u0027s financial crisis. \r\nFurthermore, all Member States must pay their assessed contributions in \r\naccordance with their obligations under the Charter. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n94 \r\n(Mrs, af Ugglas. Sweden) \r\nWe are gratified to note that the broader security concept which Sweden \r\nadvocates is included in \"An Agenda for Peace\". This view should be the basis \r\nfor the reform of the whole United Nations system. In his report to this \r\nyear\u0027s session of the Economic and Social Council, the Secretary-General has \r\nfurther developed his thoughts on this issue. His central message is that a \r\ndistinction cannot and should not be made between United Nations tasks in the \r\npolitical sphere and those in the economic and social fields. Sweden supports \r\nthis view. In this context, the proposal to hold a world summit for social \r\ndevelopment in 1995 takes on particular significance. \r\nIn the Nordic United Nations project, several concrete proposals are \r\npresented for making the work of United Nations development assistance more \r\neffective for example, through a new governance structure and a new \r\nfinancing system. We welcome the first step taken by the General Assembly in \r\nstrengthening the capacity of the United Nations to respond to humanitarian \r\nemergencies. Following the July session of the Economic and Social Council, \r\nwe hope that it will be possible to proceed successfully with the reform \r\nmeasures in the economic and social fields during this session of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\nThe protection of human rights is also included in the broader security \r\nconcept. In preparation for next year\u0027s United Nations Conference on Human \r\nRights, Sweden intends to work for measures and procedures which can increase \r\nrespect for human rights throughout the world, both in developing countries \r\nand in industrial countries. Let me stress that the Swedish Government \r\nconsiders that there is a clear connection between respect for fundamental \r\nhuman rights and economic and social development. Consequently, the question \r\nof a country\u0027s development cannot be divorced from its implementation of \r\nrespect for human rights. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n95 \r\n(Mrs, af Ugglas. Sweden) \r\nSweden is presenting its candidature for a seat on the United Nations \r\nSecurity Council for the 1993-1994 period of office. We are doing so on the \r\nbasis of the active role we have traditionally played in the United Nations \r\nsystem. In the election of non-permanent members of the Council, the Charter \r\nprescribes that due regard be paid to the contribution of Members to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and to the other purposes of \r\nthe Organization. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n96 \r\n(Mrs, af Ugglas. Sweden) \r\nMany Swedes have served the United Nations, both in the Secretariat and \r\nin the field. Names such as Folke Bernadotte and Dag Hammarskjold are part of \r\nUnited Nations history. \r\nSweden has participated in practically all United Nations peace-keeping \r\noperations. On the basis of our experience in this area, we and the other \r\nNordic countries can offer advice and training to countries which are now \r\npreparing for peace-keeping missions. \r\nSweden placed the problems of the environment on the agenda of the United \r\nNations. It hosted the first United Nations Conference in this area. \r\nFor many years, we have been in the vanguard of the United Nations work \r\nin the economic and social sphere, both as regards planning and financing. \r\nSweden is a major donor to many of the United Nations development \r\nagencies and the fourth-largest contributor to the United Nations system as a \r\nwhole. \r\nIf Sweden wins support for its candidature for a seat on the United \r\nNations Security Council, it will entail greater responsibility than was the \r\ncase when we participated in the work of the Council sixteen years ago. We \r\nare prepared to shoulder this responsiblity. \r\nIn an international environment which presents new challenges and \r\nopportunities for cooperation, Sweden\u0027s United Nations policy can be \r\nsummarized in the following three points. \r\nFirst, we want to contribute to the reinforcement of United Nations \r\npeacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-building ca£ability. This is a question \r\nof maintaining the Security Council\u0027s effectiveness, which also assumes that \r\nits decisions enjoy the wide support of Member States. \r\nThe Secretary-General should be given greater possibilities to take \r\ninitiatives. It is essential that the financing of peace-keeping operations \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n97 \r\n(Mrs, af Ugglas. Sweden) \r\nbe guaranteed. Sweden supports the proposal for the establishment of a \r\nspecial contingency fund. \r\nSecondly, we want to work for an extension of international structures \r\nfor cooperation to enable us to meet the threats to peace, security and \r\neconomic development in the 1990s. We attach great importance to the \r\ninteraction between the United Nations and regional organizations. \r\nThirdly, we want to promote the application of a broader security concept \r\nwhich contains not merely a military component but also human rights, \r\ndemocracy, economic freedom, social justice and environmental responsibility. \r\nWe support the view that United Nations tasks in the political sphere and in \r\nthe economic and social field must be considered in the same context. A \r\ncomprehensive view of this nature, based on the United Nations Charter, should \r\nform the basis for reform of the United Nations system. \r\nThe United Nations can establish genuine security in the world. It can \r\ndo so only by tackling the roots of insecurity. \r\nMr. SILVA CIMMA (Chile) (interpretation from Spanish): In our \r\ntimes, a unique advance has been made in the search for peace, understanding \r\nand cooperation among peoples. Mankind is progressively becoming more and \r\nmore aware of this new reality. \r\nAccordingly, the present juncture is an appropriate one for reflection \r\nand dialogue within the framework of the United Nations, for a review of our \r\nachievements as well as of our shortcomings, and for a serious, in-depth study \r\nof the role we assign to the Organization and the hopes we seek to fulfil, \r\nhopefully in the near future. \r\nI wish to reiterate here the conviction of President Aylwin\u0027s Government \r\nregarding the moral, political and social imperative of placing the needs of \r\npeople at the heart of United Nations activities. Reducing poverty. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n98 \r\n(Mr. Silva Cimma. Chile) \r\nincreasing employment and promoting social cohesion are needs shared by the \r\nentire international community. \r\nFor these reasons, the importance of this forty-seventh session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly is inarguable. \r\nWe welcome the new Member States that have joined the United Nations and \r\nthat will take part with us in its endeavours. \r\nWe welcome your election, Mr. President, since it will permit an \r\nexperienced figure in world politics to guide our deliberations and lead them \r\nto an outcome which is satisfactory to all. At the same time we appreciate \r\nthe judicious administration of your illustrious predecessor, \r\nAmbassador Shihabi.* \r\nThe world is on the threshold of the twenty-first century. We have left \r\nbehind us the senseless ideological confrontations between the super-Powers \r\nand the danger of nuclear holocaust. \r\nBut there is no guarantee of peace. There are still old tensions and new \r\nones the result of racism, religious fanaticism and extreme nationalism; there \r\nremains the historic challenge of development for all; and there is still a \r\nterrible social debt which cannot be rescheduled to the most \r\ndisenfranchised members of all our societies. \r\nOur Organization is still faced with many challenges calling for more \r\neffective action. The war in Bosnia and the grave reports of massive \r\nviolations of human rights, reaching the point of genocide, in the territories \r\ndevastated by the conflict in the former Yugoslavia demand concerted and \r\nvigorous action. \r\nMr. Phoofolo (Lesotho), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n99 \r\n(Mr. Silva Cimma. Chile) \r\nThe auspicious but still uncertain process launched in South Africa poses \r\nnew challenges for our Organization. \r\nThe ongoing negotiations on the Middle East augur well for the future, \r\nbut other situations in the world still pose a threat to peace. \r\nSocial confrontation, the outcome of the growing gap between well-being \r\nand poverty, has become a source of global instability. Today more than ever, \r\ndevelopment with eguity is the new requirement for peace, a common task we are \r\ncalled upon to join together and undertake. \r\nNow that the cold war is over, the role of the United Nations has taken \r\non more relevance than ever before. The Organization has a central role to \r\nplay in building a new international order which will make it possible to face \r\nthe crises that constitute serious threats to peace in many parts of the world. \r\nThese crises, and a whole series of economic, social and environmental \r\nchallenges, can be overcome only if the Organization is strengthened, commands \r\nmore respect and becomes more efficient in the pursuit of its lofty goals. \r\nOf course, it is essential that this enormous task we are calling on the \r\nworld Organization to perform be complemented by the preventive activities \r\ncarried out by regional organizations. Our own regional organization, the \r\nOrganization of American States, is carrying out that mission by engaging in a \r\nrealistic and tenacious effort to forestall or resolve the region\u0027s varied and \r\ndifficult problems. \r\nBut it is in the United Nations that we must develop the concepts, \r\nprinciples and agreements which will make the security of individuals a \r\npriority objective of international cooperation. This, in turn, will enhance \r\ncoexistence among States. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n100 \r\n(Mr. Silva Cimma. Phil.) \r\nWe must search together for new political directions that allow us to \r\nstrengthen the role of the Organization in the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity, in the defence of human rights, in the protection of the \r\nenvironment, in the struggle against drug trafficking and terrorism and in \r\nclosing the gap between North and South. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n101 \r\n(Mr. Silva Cimma. Chile) \r\nThe starting-point must be the values that inspire our action. Chile \r\nproclaims before this worldwide forum its unswerving dedication to peace and \r\nrespect for the dignity of the individual, its conviction that justice is the \r\nfoundation of any truly stable society, its belief in the universal value of \r\nhuman rights, its respect for individual creativity and democracy as an ideal \r\nform of government its commitment, in short, to the needs of the most humble \r\nin all our societies and its recognition of the validity of law and of the \r\nsearch for consensus as a foundation for major national and international \r\nagreements. \r\nChile firmly believes in the Charter of the United Nations. There is no \r\nsubstitute for this Organization as a world parliament, as a forum for \r\ninternational debates and agreements, as a source of innovative technical \r\nanalysis and as a multilateral body responsible for peace, security and \r\ndevelopment. \r\nJust as we back the role of the United Nations without reservation, we \r\nlikewise set no limits on our demand that it should be efficient and \r\ndemocratic in the attainment of its objectives. Certainly, that depends on \r\nthe will of Governments, as well as on the strengthening of the competence and \r\nautonomy of the Secretariat. \r\nAbove all, a balance needs to be struck between the General Assembly as \r\nthe principal political organ, the Security Council as the organ responsible \r\nfor dealing with the traditional problems of peace and security, and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council as the primary body for promoting sustainable and \r\nequitable development. \r\nMutually respectful interaction among these three levels should permit \r\nthe United Nations to take the lead in creating an international order of \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n102 \r\n(Mr. Silva Cimma. Chile) \r\npeace in which the interests and problems of all countries are adequately \r\nrepresented. \r\nIn this new world order which is taking shape and which all members of \r\nthe Organization must contribute to designing, a vitally important place is \r\noccupied by the Secretary-General\u0027s report, entitled \"An Agenda for Peace\" \r\n(A/47/277), which contains ideas and suggestions regarding preventive \r\ndiplomacy and peacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-building. \r\nChile agrees that the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security should be strengthened. \r\nWhile preventive diplomacy is playing an increasingly significant role on \r\nthe international scene, the concept of peace-building, in the sense of \r\ncreating a new climate and strengthening security through economic, social and \r\ncultural development, is a fundamental issue. \r\nOur country is collaborating with the United Nations and is prepared to \r\nincrease its participation in the future, should that prove necessary. \r\nChile\u0027s readiness in this regard has been expressed in its support for the \r\nSecurity Council in the decisions that have been adopted. Likewise, it has in \r\nrecent years placed at the service of the United Nations the knowledge and \r\nprofessional experience of its armed forces and forces of public order. \r\nChilean soldiers have traditionally been among the members of the United \r\nNations observer forces in the Middle East and the Asian subcontinent. Our \r\nmarines are initiating their activities in Cambodia, our pilots have been \r\nactive in Kuwait, and our police are collaborating with the peace force in El \r\nSalvador. \r\nIn this spirit of service to the cause of peace, Chile is a constant \r\nparticipant in the debates in multilateral forums on disarmament on a global \r\nscale, without prejudice to our active involvement on the regional level. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n103 \r\n(Mr. Silva Cimma. Chile) \r\nWe support the Convention on chemical weapons and reiterate our \r\nlegitimate desire to become a full member of the Conference on Disarmament \r\nonce the issue of its enlargement becomes the subject of real discussion. \r\nIn the regional sphere, we see as important the initiative we have taken, \r\ntogether with Argentina and Brazil, that is designed to give full effect to \r\nthe Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean through a set of amendments intended to strengthen its monitoring \r\nsystem and which the conference of signatories has approved by acclamation. \r\nIn the context of the positive spirit that has succeeded the cold-war \r\nperiod and is characterized by the search for agreements and a climate of \r\nfriendship and collaboration between the Powers, my country considers that the \r\ntime has come to undertake, on a carefully thought-out time scale, the total \r\nelimination of nuclear weapons, and to put a definitive end right now to the \r\ntesting of such weapons. \r\nI join my voice with those of the Ministers of the Nordic Group who, \r\nmeeting at Svalbard, welcome the efforts being made, particularly the halting \r\nof the French tests in the Pacific, and expressed their wish that the \r\nvoluntary moratorium on all nuclear explosions should become a permanent one, \r\nremoving from the world once and for all these practices which threaten our \r\nsecurity, coexistence and environment. \r\nIn the years to come, we shall have to take up the issue of the \r\ncomposition of the Security Council. We believe that this important body \r\nshould reflect new international realities, and we are accordingly ready to \r\nconsider with interest and sympathy new formulas that would appropriately \r\nreflect the aspirations of new world Powers which are seeking to become \r\nregular members of the Council. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n104 \r\n(Mr. Silva Cimma. Chile) \r\nIt is also essential to strengthen the presence in that body of the \r\nvarious developing regions. Inevitably, this will entail greater \r\nparticipation numerically, as well as new forms of regional representation. \r\nWith improvements over time, this practice could become a mechanism for \r\nrepresentation of the regional groups which would combine freedom of action \r\nfor the country elected with the expression of the will of the countries of \r\nits region. This system, if effectively operated, could ensure that all \r\nMembers of the Organization feel that they are participating to the proper \r\nextent in the decisions of the Security Council. \r\nChile is also interested in strengthening the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. According to the Charter of the United Nations, this is the \r\nprincipal specialized body of the system for analysing in an integrated way \r\nthe political, technical and operational dimensions of current economic and \r\nsocial problems. The Council should be strengthened and renewed in order to \r\nbecome a true council for development, capable of guiding high-level dialogue, \r\nformulating development policies and providing proper guidance for the \r\noperational activities of the system. \r\nWe shall be participating actively in discussions under way on these \r\nissues on the basis of the interesting proposals submitted by the Nordic \r\ncountries and the Group of 77, and of the resolutions of the most recent \r\nsession of the Council. \r\nA factor that will contribute to the reform of the\" Economic and Social \r\nCouncil will be the establishment, under it, of the commission for sustainable \r\ndevelopment, which is called upon to become the body for monitoring \r\nenvironment. problems. The link between the commission on sustainable \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n105 \r\n(Mr. Silva Cimma. Chile) \r\ndevelopment and the world environment fund is also the key to the success of \r\nAgenda 21, the ambitious programme of action approved by the United Nations \r\nConference on Environment and Development. \r\nThe practical results of the Conference, which were characterized by the \r\ngreat effort made to reach agreement, are being carefully watched by the \r\npublic at large, which is participating in ever-greater numbers in this \r\nprocess. \r\nThe signing of the Conventions on biological diversity and climate \r\nchange, the convening of the world conferences on desertification a subject \r\nof great interest to many countries, but of vital importance to the African \r\nnations and the conference on fishing on the high seas are milestones in the \r\ninternational effort to preserve the environment. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n106 \r\n(Mr. Silva Cimma. Chile) \r\nWe cannot enter a new era of world peace although it is potentially \r\nwithin our grasp if we forget the human being. In the final analysis, our \r\ncapacity to lead and the raison d\u0027etre of the United Nations will be measured \r\nby the success we achieve in the field of social development. \r\nWithout greater well-being for all our citizens, there will be no peace, \r\nsecurity or lasting stability at either the national or the international \r\nlevel. That is why we put forward the initiative for a world summit for \r\nsocial development. This proposal was recently endorsed unanimously in the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, which approved a positive recommendation to the \r\nGeneral Assembly that it convene the summit at the beginning of 1995 at the \r\nlevel of Heads of State and Heads of Government. \r\nI should like to take this occasion to thank all the Member States which \r\nparticipated in that consensus, and in particular the 121 countries that \r\nsponsored the relevant resolution. I should also like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for having assigned to our representative to the United \r\nNations, Ambassador Juan Somavia, the task of bringing to a successful \r\nconclusion the consultations required to put this initiative into effect. \r\nThe first step has now been taken. Much remains to be done. There is no \r\ndoubt that the primary responsibility for resolving this situation is borne at \r\nthe domestic level. Each country must take steps to stabilize the functioning \r\nof its political system, encourage investment, trade and technological \r\ndevelopment and ensure equitable distribution of income. \r\nChile has accepted that challenge. It is growing today at an annual rate \r\nof 7 per cent and has reduced unemployment to about 5 per cent and inflation \r\nto 13 per cent a year. In addition, under President Aylwin\u0027s Government, the \r\nprocess of solving the problem of external debt has been concluded, the real \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n107 \r\n(Mr. Silva Cimma. Chile) \r\nincome of salaried workers has increased by 15 per cent and policies designed \r\nto alleviate the poverty of the most disenfranchised sectors of the population \r\nhave been implemented. This has been done on the basis of an open economy \r\nwhich has concentrated on both economic and social efficiency against a \r\nbackground of personal freedom and political democracy. \r\nAlthough the success of these programmes has been recognized by the \r\nvarious sectors in our national life, we are aware that much more still needs \r\nto be done with our resources. But we are equally aware that the benefits for \r\nour country would be significantly greater if the ground rules of the \r\ninternational economy were more equitable. \r\nEven while most of the world is calling, with growing clarity and force, \r\nfor the abolition of protectionism and the formulation of stable and \r\nnon-discriminatory rules to govern international trade, unilateral measures \r\nare reversing this world-wide trend and giving rise to direct forms of \r\nprotectionism in the main world markets, in a departure from the principles \r\nand regulatory framework established under the General Agreement on Tariffs \r\nand Trade. \r\nI now wish to say a few words on the Secretariat. \r\nFirst, we welcome the election of the distinguished scholar, diplomat and \r\npolitician Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali as Secretary-General. The Members of the \r\nUnited Nations are witnesses to Chile\u0027s consistent support for the African \r\ncontinent\u0027s aspiration to see one of its own in that high post. We have \r\nalready expressed our opinion publicly at the bilateral level, within the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement and in the General Assembly last year. We already have \r\nevidence of the Secretary-General\u0027s character and decision-making ability. We \r\nsupport him in his task. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n108 \r\n(Mr. Silva Cimma. Phiigj \r\nThe Secretariat is of course a vital organ under the Charter and in the \r\nUnited Nations system. In order to meet the challenges that lie ahead, it \r\nmust act with the maximum efficiency and autonomy. \r\nThe Secretariat is at the service of all countries, and accordingly all \r\nof them must be properly represented at its various levels. The efficiency of \r\nthe Organization depends to a large extent on the confidence Governments have \r\nin the technical ability, experience and impartiality of its staff. \r\nAt a time when we are asking the Organization to perform all the tasks \r\nthat arise in this era, its constant financial insecurity is absurd. It is \r\nessential to enhance the fluidity and automaticity of countries\u0027 payment of \r\ntheir assessments. This is doubtless a responsibility that is shared by all, \r\nbut to the greatest extent by the main contributors. We cannot have a strong \r\nOrganization with a weak financial base. \r\nThe specialized agencies and regional commissions are called upon to \r\ncontinue playing a vital role in such fields as cooperation for development, \r\nprotection of the environment and economic and social analysis. The \r\ncontributions they have made, to the benefit above all of the developing \r\nworld, must be assessed at their true value.* \r\nThe support of the United Nations for the second Space Conference of the \r\nAmericas, to be held shortly in Santiago, is another example that regional and \r\nglobal efforts are complementary. \r\nChile has long had the privilege of being the site of important regional \r\noffices of the world Organization. Their presence in our country is proof of \r\nChile\u0027s commitment to the activities of the United Nations, which we shall \r\nalways be prepared to support. \r\nMr. Phoofolo (Lesotho), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n109 \r\n(Mr. Silva Cimma. Chile) \r\nThe subject of the United Nations, which is certainly what has brought us \r\ntogether, is an exciting one for the international community. Indeed, \r\nfulfilment of the purposes and principles of its Charter has been a constant \r\nconcern of our country. Likewise, failure to respect them arouses a sense of \r\nfrustration. \r\nThe duties and rights of each Member State vis-a-vis the Organization can \r\nin no way be reduced to a matter of legalities or to simple mechanical \r\naction. We recognize a real commitment to the United Nations system, and \r\nconsequently we discharge each of our duties responsibly. \r\nThe nations assembled here and indeed the world have before them the best \r\npossible opportunity of firmly guaranteeing the future of coming generations, \r\na substantial improvement in the quality of life, the elimination of the \r\ndevelopment gap and the attainment of peace in short, the opportunity of \r\nbuilding a better world for all and with all. Let us all take up that \r\nchallenge. \r\nAGENDA ITEM 111 (continued) \r\nSCALE OF ASSESSMENTS FOR THE APPORTIONMENT OF THE EXPENSES OF THE UNITED \r\nNATIONS (A/47/442/Add.2) \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I should like to draw the Assembly\u0027s attention to \r\ndocument A/47/442/Add.2, which contains a letter addressed to me by the \r\nSecretary-General informing me that since the issuance of his communications \r\ndated 15 September and 18 September 1992 Gambia has made the necessary payment \r\nto reduce its arrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the \r\nCharter. May I take it that the General Assembly duly takes note of this \r\ninformation? \r\nIt was so decided. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n110 \r\nAGENDA ITEM 9 (continued) \r\nGENERAL DEBATE \r\nMr. PINHEIRO (Portugal) (spoke in Portuguese; English text furnished \r\nby the delegation): At the outset, I should like to congratulate the \r\nPresident and the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly on their respective \r\nelection. I am certain that their recognized personal gualities guarantee, in \r\nthe eyes of all those present, an outstanding stewardship of our work. \r\nI thank the outgoing President, Ambassador Samir Shihabi, for the \r\ndedication he showed throughout the last session of the General Assembly, \r\nthereby contributing to the consolidation of the process leading to the reform \r\nof the Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n111 \r\n(Mr. Pinheiro. Portugal) \r\nI also address the Secretary-General, under whose aegis it has already \r\nbeen possible to take concrete and decisive steps towards a thorough reform of \r\nthe Organization and the restructuring of the Secretariat along more flexible \r\nand operational lines. My Government appreciates that initiative and gives it \r\nits full support. Portugal views \"An Agenda for Peace\" (A/47/277) in that \r\nlight. As was made clear by the British Foreign Secretary Mr. Douglas Hurd, \r\nwho spoke this morning on behalf of the European Community and its member \r\nStates, we believe that the proposals presented by Mr. Boutros-Ghali deserve \r\nspecial attention. \r\nIt fell to Portugal to preside over the European Community Council of \r\nMinisters during a period of turmoil in recent history. Everywhere \r\ntraditional alignments are disappearing. Regimes which until recently were \r\nheld to be unchangeable are giving way to new institutions, oriented towards \r\nthe defence of human dignity and democratic pluralism. The legacy of several \r\ndecades has been shaken up in a few short years. \r\nDuring the first half of 1992 the Portuguese Presidency of the Council \r\nsought to promote a greater opening of the Community to the outside. I do not \r\nspeak merely of enlargement and political dialogue; I speak of modalities of \r\ncooperation and assistance and the presentation of constructive proposals to \r\ndeal with important issues in international economic relations. I also speak \r\nof the incentives for regional integration throughout the world. \r\nFurthermore, the external activity of the European Community did not \r\nignore crisis situations. In this respect, the conflict involving several \r\nrepublics of the former Yugoslavia stands out. Priority was given to the \r\ninvolvement of the United Nations in the search for a political solution to \r\nthat grave crisis. We sought from the beginning to generate synergism between \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n112 \r\n(Mr. Pinheiro. Portugal) \r\nthe efforts of the European Community and the action of the Secretary-General \r\nand the Security Council. I believe that the degree achieved, both at the \r\nlevel of the decision-making bodies of the two organizations and in the field, \r\nwhere European Community monitors and United Nations peace-keeping forces are \r\ndeployed, is extremely positive. I am certain that it will have to continue \r\nto be so. \r\nI should like to take this opportunity to reiterate Portugal\u0027s full \r\nagreement with the principles and measures defined at the recent London \r\nConference. They are the basis for a negotiated settlement of the problems of \r\nthe former Yugoslavia. We support the peace process that was relaunched on \r\nthat occasion under the experienced guidance of Lord Owen and \r\nMr. Cyrus Vance. The foundation of that process consists of work already done \r\nin the framework of the Conference presided over by Lord Carrington, to whom I \r\nam grateful for his competence and dedication. \r\nLastly, I must pay tribute, for the tasks they have performed, under \r\ncircumstances of extreme hardship, even involving the sacrifice of their own \r\nlives, to the members of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), in \r\nwhich Portugal has the privilege of participating, the European Community \r\nmonitoring mission and all the humanitarian agencies involved. \r\nI have been emphasizing that the road to progress is built on a sharing \r\nof responsibility by various actors in the international community. It was in \r\nthat light that Lisbon hosted last May the Conference on assistance to the \r\nnewly independent States. \r\nFollowing the first Conference on that subject, the Washington \r\nConference, we sought to give an answer to the challenges presented by the \r\ncollapse of the Soviet Union, an event which I then considered to be among the \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n113 \r\n(Mr. Pinheiro. Portugal) \r\nmost significant of the century. Aware of the obstacles to be overcome, the \r\nparticipating countries agreed to lend their support to structural programmes \r\nof assistance and economic cooperation in a macroeconomic sense. Such actions \r\nwould complement and not duplicate the programmes being implemented by several \r\nfinancial institutions. \r\nAs for the political side of the Conference, it was restated that the new \r\nStates must try to develop progressively a regional form of cooperation \r\nreflecting the mutual dependence that exists in so many vital sectors. \r\nTo that aim we must add the demand for full respect for the principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the commitments of the Conference on \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Such conduct is essential for \r\ncontinued assistance and the process of democratic reform. \r\nWe are witnessing events of great scope and significance in other parts \r\nof the world. The Middle East peace process exhibits a new and encouraging \r\nvitality which must be fostered by all. There are no viable alternatives to \r\nthat process, which was initiated in Madrid. \r\nPortugal, like its partners in the Community, considers that any just, \r\nlasting and comprehensive settlement of the question of the Middle East must \r\nbe based upon Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). That \r\nbelief was reiterated in June, together with a message of hope from the \r\nEuropean Community Council meeting in Lisbon. It is now reinforced by the new \r\npolicies of the Israeli Government, and it will be further strengthened by \r\ngestures of reciprocity from the Arab Governments. \r\nWe have always advocated the presence of the United Nations in the peace \r\nprocess, commensurate with the importance of its role in international \r\npolitics in general and the Middle East in particular. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n114 \r\n(Mr. Pinheiro. Portugal) \r\nSecurity and stability in the Mediterranean are vital strategic factors \r\nfor Europe, especially for those States that, like ours, are close neighbours \r\nof that region. In this regard, the Maghreb is particularly relevant for us. \r\nGeographical proximity, a common history and close ties justify the genuine \r\nconcern with which we have followed the political, social and economic \r\nproblems the Maghreb is experiencing. We are aware that their effects \r\nthreaten a delicate balance and the well-being of its populations. \r\nFor these reasons, the European Community is committed to strengthening \r\nregional solidarity and establishing innovative forms of dialogue and \r\ncooperation reflecting the aims of partnership that motivate both sides. The \r\nLisbon meeting of the European Community Council confirmed this view of the \r\nfuture in a clear Declaration which will renew the ties between the European \r\nCommunity and the Maghreb in all fields. \r\nThough an Atlantic country, Portugal does not forsake its Mediterranean \r\nheritage. \r\nPortugal devotes special attention to Africa. We follow with expectancy \r\nand optimism the processes of reconciliation and democratization under way \r\nthroughout southern Africa. \r\nIn Angola the day of the long-awaited general elections is nearing. In \r\nspite of the structural and logistical difficulties, I am certain that, \r\nwhatever the outcome, the Angolan people will find their way towards a \r\npluralistic and tolerant society, whose foundations will be the nation\u0027s \r\nenormous potential and its human and natural resources. \r\nTurning to Mozambique, Portugal gladly welcomes the recent meeting \r\nbetween President Chissano and Mr. Afonso Dhlkama, President of RENAMO. \r\nMutual trust and open dialogue are, and will continue to be, decisive for an \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n115 \r\n(Mr. Pinheiro. Portugal) \r\nirreversible advance of the Mozambican peace process. We therefore hope that \r\nthe spirit of Rome will remain alive among all the participants. \r\nEverything indicates that the United Nations will play a preponderant \r\nrole in the subsequent stages of the process. In the wake of the success of \r\nthe United Nations involvement in Angola, I appeal to the Organization to give \r\nthe attention, the means and the resources needed so that Mozambique in its \r\nturn, in the near future, may reach peace, democracy and long-sought economic \r\nprogress. \r\nAs for South Africa, a country which is vital to regional stability, \r\nPortugal has maintained close contacts with its major political forces, urging \r\nthem to engage in dialogue and practise tolerance. \r\nA drastic reduction in social tension and the resumption of talks in the \r\nframework of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) are an \r\nabsolute priority which we must pursue so as to eradicate the structural \r\ncauses of a decades-old conflict. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n116 \r\n(Mr. Pinheiro. Portugal) \r\nPortugal wholeheartedly supports the sending of United Nations, European \r\nCommunity and Organization of African Unity observers to South Africa. These \r\nobservers may play a significant role. We see no credible alternative to this \r\nconcerted effort. \r\nWe have sought to encourage the dialogue between Europe and Latin America \r\nin this period of noteworthy development and regional integration \r\ninitiatives. In this respect I should like to emphasize the significance of \r\nthe Eighth Ministerial Meeting of the San Jose countries, held in Lisbon, and \r\nthe Second Institutionalized Ministerial Meeting of the Rio Group, held in \r\nSantiago. At both meetings, new forms of cooperation were established \r\nagreement on the promotion of human rights at the first and on greater \r\ninvolvement of the European Investment Bank in programmes for the development \r\nof the South American continent at the second. \r\nMan is the reason for all our efforts. His dignity is, after all, our \r\nguiding universal value. Thus it is not legitimate to allow the collapse of \r\nGovernments, civil wars or adverse natural conditions to jeopardize human \r\nlives and render mere survival a daily battle. \r\nPortugal associates itself with the efforts under way to ease the \r\nsuffering of the civilian population of Somalia, a crisis which is constantly \r\nin our minds. Despite all the actions carried out by the international \r\ncommunity, a solution to this tragedy is yet to be found. Situations such as \r\nthese must be faced and dealt with in a different way. Relief for the \r\nafflicted populations comes before any local political conditionalities and \r\ncannot be subject to any preconditions or distortions whatsoever in it\u0027s \r\ndistribution. There is clearly a need for preventive action by the United \r\nNations, making available the necessary humanitarian aid and peace-keeping \r\nforces in the early stages of crises whenever possible. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n117 \r\n(Mr. Pinheiro. Portugal) \r\nThe defence of each individual\u0027s dignity, an aim which must guide us at \r\nall times, has been the leitmotif of my statement as the representative of \r\nPortugal. \r\nThe universal and indivisible nature of human rights is a principle which \r\ndeserves general acceptance. Portugal maintains that condemnation of any \r\nviolations of such rights can no longer be considered to be interference in \r\nthe internal affairs of a State. We believe that the observance of the main \r\ninternational covenants is a fundamental condition for peace and progress. In \r\nthis respect, we state unequivocally that there is a direct link between human \r\nrights, democracy and development; that is, development aid, in order to be \r\nproductive and therefore justifiable presupposes the practice of democracy \r\nand fundamental freedoms at the receiving end. We still have a long way to go. \r\nI should like once more to alert the international community to the \r\nsituation in East Timor, a Non-Self-Governing Territory under Portuguese \r\nauthority illegally occupied by Indonesia, in violation of the principles \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter and the relevant resolutions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council. \r\nWe all recall the tragic events that took place in Dili\u0027s Santa Cruz \r\ncemetery on 12 November 1991, which rightly received universal condemnation. \r\nWhen faced with unprecedented criticism, the Indonesian Government made \r\npromises, set up committees of inquiry, offered condolences and subsribed to a \r\nconsensus statement of the Commission on Human Rights. Nevertheless, it \r\nrefused to accept any inquiry under international supervision which could shed \r\nlight on what had happened and clarify the circumstances which made it \r\npossible. The subsequently released report of the inquiry that did take place \r\ndid little in this respect. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n118 \r\n(Mr. Pinheiro. Portugal) \r\nOn the other hand, heavy prison sentences including a life term were \r\ngiven to survivors of the killing, not indicted for violent activities, while \r\nthe military personnel involved in the shooting were charged with mere \r\ndisciplinary offences and given purely token prison terms. \r\nAll of this contradicted the undertaking in the Commission on Human \r\nRights, as the Subcommission on Prevention of Piscrimination and Protection of \r\nMinorities recently recognized in a resolution adopted for the first time by \r\nan absolute majority. \r\nTo avoid the repetition of massacres and other grave violations of human \r\nrights, we must address the true causes of this situation and initiate a new \r\nstage of consideration of the issue. Portugal, in its capacity as \r\nadministering Power recognized by the United Nations, presented to the \r\nSecretary-General last January a proposal for a dialogue, without \r\npreconditions and under his auspices, with Indonesia and all the parties \r\ndirectly involved. The objective is a just, comprehensive and internationally \r\nacceptable solution, with full respect for the legitimate interests of the \r\nEast Timorese people, including the right to self-determination, in conformity \r\nwith the principles of the Charter and international law. \r\nTo that end, we have spared no effort and look forward to hearing the \r\nresults of the Secretary-General\u0027s initiative when, in the next few days in \r\nNew York, he will host an informal meeting of the Foreign Ministers of \r\nPortugal and Indonesia. \r\nIn conclusion, I recall that a year ago I exhorted all States Members of \r\nthe Organization to work together to achieve the essential aims of the Charter. \r\nThe responsibilities placed upon my Government in the course of 1992 have \r\ngiven us a clearer perception of the nature of the arduous tasks before us. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n119 \r\n(Mr. Pinheiro. Portugal) \r\nIt is our duty to correct history\u0027s errors towards man, guided by legal and, \r\nabove all, ethical principles, so that future generations may remember us \r\nthrough a legacy of justice and peace. \r\nMrs. BONGO (Gabon) (interpretation from French): May I first. Sir, \r\non behalf of my delegation and on behalf of the Government and people of \r\nGabon, convey to Ambassador Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria our warm congratulations \r\non his well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its \r\nforty-seventh session. His personal qualities and experience in international \r\naffairs undoubtedly guarantee the success of our work. \r\nOur congratulations also go to the outgoing President, \r\nAmbassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, whom we thank for the dynamic and \r\nexemplary way in which he discharged his duties. \r\nTo the Secretary-General, whose recent election to head our Organization \r\nhonours all of Africa, we should like to reiterate our full support for \r\neverything he is doing to promote preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and \r\npeace-keeping, and particularly the peaceful advent of a new world order. His \r\ngreat diplomatic experience is a guarantee of the fulfilment of his commitment \r\nto carry out to the best of his ability his delicate and noble mission in the \r\nservice of the entire world community. \r\nFinally, we welcome all those new States which have come upon the \r\ninternational political scene recently. Their arrival, we are certain, will \r\nstrengthen the universality of our Organization and contribute to \r\nstrengthening the bonds of solidarity between Member States. \r\nSince the end of the East-West confrontation our Organization has been \r\ndemonstrating its ability fully to play the role assigned it by the Charter \r\nwhenever Member States act collectively. It has demonstrated this \r\nparticularly in Afghanistan, Central America, Cambodia, Kuwait and Namibia. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n120 \r\n(Mrs. Bongo. Gabon) \r\nThis solidarity should be even more effective in settling other conflicts \r\nwhich, regrettably, we witness elsewhere. \r\nAt the very opening of this session, the situation in Somalia is \r\nparticularly disguieting. How can we remain unmoved when we daily see on our \r\ntelevision screens faces bearing the imprint of war, disease and hunger? How \r\ncan we remain indifferent to the pain and tragedy of millions of women and \r\nchildren whose only aspiration is to live in peace in their own environment \r\nand to seek better development? \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n121 \r\n(Mrs. Bongo. Gabon) \r\nIs it not indeed scandalous that in our day and age war and the use of \r\nforce are still the means preferred by some to settle intercommunity \r\nproblems? Undoubtedly, this is a challenge to our collective intelligence. \r\nIn Somalia, as elsewhere, in a tremendous upsurge of human solidarity we \r\nmust make a collective effort to put an end to the fratricidal confrontations \r\nin order to rebuild trust between communities linked by history and geography \r\nthat perforce must live in harmony. \r\nFor its part, and particularly in the case of Somalia, Gabon has taken \r\nconcrete steps along these lines. \r\nThis appeal equally applies to Mozambique, where natural catastrophes \r\nhave seriously exacerbated the complexity of a conflict on which discussions \r\nare now under way. In this connection the Government of Gabon very much \r\nvalued the meetings in Rome on 7 August and in Gabarone on 18 September \r\nbetween President Chissano and the leader of RENAMO, Mr. Alfonso Phlakama. \r\nIn another region of the continent, the situation in Liberia is also a \r\nmatter of grave concern. For two years now efforts to bring about peace on \r\nthe part of the Economic Community of West African States have encountered \r\nobstacles despite the presence among the belligerents of 7,000 \"White Helmets\" \r\nof the disengagement forces of the Economic Community of West African States \r\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG). •• \r\nApart from subregional action, which is highly commendable, the United \r\nNations has provided welcome aid to the Liberian population. \r\nThe international community clearly provides the necessary means for all \r\nthose who, despite their own difficulties, are making a contribution to \r\nbringing about peace in those countries. \r\nA / 4 7 / P V . 7 \r\n122 \r\n(Mrs. Bongo. Gabon) \r\nWith respect to the situations in the Sudan, Rwanda, Niger, Mali and \r\nChad, the Government of Gabon will support all initiatives to bring about a \r\npeaceful settlement of the disputes between members of the same family. \r\nWith respect to the situations in the Sudan, Rwanda, Niger, Mali and \r\nChad, the Government of Gabon will support all initiatives to bring about a \r\npeaceful settlement of the disputes between members of the same family. \r\nIt is in this spirit that Gabon has often offered its good offices in the \r\nsettlement of conflicts in Africa. \r\nThe case of South Africa is of deepest concern to us. Indeed, the system \r\nof apartheid has still not disappeared from the South African political \r\nlandscape. To be sure, a few months ago, under unprecedented international \r\npressure, the Government in Pretoria committed itself to a policy of reform \r\ndesigned to eradicate this odious system. But for some months now we have \r\nbeen witnessing an intensification of violence as a means of political \r\nexpression. The Boipatong massacre and the Ciskei events are unfortunate \r\nexamples which undermine the efforts to promote dialogue, which Gabon and the \r\ninternational community at large so earnestly seek. \r\nThe promises of the South African Government gave some comfort to all \r\nthose who want a positive outcome to the situation in that country so that it \r\ncan join the comity of nations through the resumption of the Convention for a \r\nOemocratic South Africa (COPESA) talks. But nothing at the present time would \r\nallow the international community to relax its pressure nor to reduce its \r\nvigilance with-respect to Pretoria, particularly as our Organization, whose \r\nrecent initiatives deserve to be encouraged, is urgently demanding the \r\napplication of the principle one-man, one-vote. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n123 \r\n(Mrs. Bongo. Gabon) \r\nWith respect to the Arab-Israeli conflict, at the core of which is still \r\nthe question of Palestine, the new spirit now pervading international \r\nrelations, as well as the desire to reach a diplomatic solution voiced by the \r\nparties involved, are conducive to giving a fresh and lasting impetus to the \r\npeace process begun in Madrid in October 1991 which is currently continuing in \r\nWashington. \r\nHow can we remain indifferent to the tragedy we are witnessing in the \r\nformer Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina? Quite clearly, \r\nwhat we have here is a major challenge where humanitarian assistance, even \r\nwith the help of military logistics, is not sufficient. Gabon, which wishes \r\nto see a speedy peaceful outcome to this conflict, highly commends the leading \r\nrole now being played by the United Nations. \r\nGenerally speaking, all Member States expect our Organization to play a \r\ndecisive role in peace-keeping and in maintaining international security, as \r\nwell as in the eradication of poverty and in the struggle against famine. \r\nThat is why my country wholeheartedly supports the recommendations of the \r\nSecretary-General contained in his \"Agenda for Peace\". \r\nIf it is to serve its purpose the Organization must restructure its main \r\norgans in the light of the current international situation. To this end, the \r\npolitical role of the General Assembly and the supervisory functions of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council should be further strengthened in order to make \r\nthe entire United Nations system more dynamic. \r\nFurthermore, as President Bongo requested from this rostrum, first in \r\n1977, when he was President of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), and \r\nthen during the fortieth session of the General Assembly, the countries of the \r\nA / 4 7 / P V . 7 \r\n124 \r\n(Mrs. Bongo. Gabon) \r\nthird world should now be represented in the Security Council as permanent \r\nmembers, in order to make decision making at that level more democratic. \r\nInternational law is being completely rethought. Hallowed concepts of \r\nyesteryear, such as \"national sovereignty\", \"territorial integrity\" and, above \r\nall, \"non-interference in the internal affairs of States\", behind which the \r\ninternational community was finding it more and more difficult to hide its \r\nuneasy conscience, are now being given a new normative content. \r\nHence, for some years now, a new concept has appeared on the \r\ninternational scene, and that is the \"right to interference\". It would \r\nappear, a priori, to be contradictory with these very principles of \"national \r\nsovereignty\", \"territorial integrity\", and particularly \"non-interference in \r\nthe internal affairs of States\", which underlie peaceful relations among \r\nStates. \r\nBut to assure that this right is not selective or abused, its exercise \r\nshould be the exclusive responsibility of the United Nations. Furthermore, \r\ncalling into guestion certain of these principles is not necessarily a \r\nnegative step. That step should be taken whenever these principles themselves \r\nhave led to crises. \r\nIn so doing, the United Nations could acquire more extended powers, and \r\nhence given the appropriate means, which would enable it to exercise that \r\nright, if need be, without any discrimation whatsoever. \r\nIn his most recent report on the work of the Organization, in 1991, the \r\nformer Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, wrote: \r\n\"No system of collective security will remain viable unless workable \r\nsolutions are sought to the problem of poverty and destitution, \r\nafflicting the greater part of the world.\" (A/46/1, p. 12. VIII) \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n125 \r\n(Mrs. Bongo. Gabon) \r\nThat is why United Nations action would also stand to gain if it were \r\nsimilarly strengthened in the economic and financial fields. In this way, it \r\nshould continue in the direction it has already taken in order the better to \r\nadapt itself to the new challenges facing mankind. \r\nEconomics now has a more prominent place in international relations. The \r\ncreation of an increasing number of subregional and regional economic \r\ngroupings, as well as the globalization of international trade, have turned \r\nour world into one immense market whose working rules should be equitable. \r\nThe international community very quickly realized this requirement for \r\ncomplementarity and solidarity when, in 1974, it established a new \r\ninternational economic order. \r\nSimilarly, multilateral organizations, such as the European Economic \r\nCommunity, by creating machinery to regulate world trade, have clearly \r\nevidenced their desire to come to the assistance of the poorer countries by \r\ncreating the STABEX and SYSMIN systems. \r\nIn the same vein, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has \r\nadvocated for some years now constructive negotiations between producers and \r\nconsumers in order to strike a better balance between world supply and \r\ndemand. The efforts of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Pevelopment \r\n(UNCIAD) are along the same lines. \r\nIn this struggle for development, we realize that the United Nations has \r\ntaken a number of initiatives, the most recent of which are: the International \r\nDevelopment Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade, the \r\nUnited Nations Programme for the Economic Recovery of Africa, the Cartagena \r\nConsensus and the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n125 (a-z) \r\n(Mrs. Bongo. Gabon) \r\nWe can therefore say that, generally speaking, in recent years the world \r\nhas progressed to some extent towards greater solidarity among all peoples. \r\nBut there are still serious grounds for concern. Pespite the progress made on \r\nthe debt problem, through the so-called Toronto, Houston and London measures, \r\nthe question of cancelling the debts of the least developed countries, and \r\nconsiderably reducing them for the other developing countries, remains a \r\nburning issue, particularly for the so-called middle-income countries. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n126 \r\n(Mrs. Bonoo. Gabon) \r\nUp to now Gabon, which falls into that category, has not benefited from \r\nany of these measures, whereas at the same time it has seen a sharp drop in \r\nits per capita income. It would be in the interests of no one, especially the \r\ninternational community, if the African countries were to go into a downward \r\nspiral of economic decline and indebtedness. Today everyone knows that the \r\nmeasures that have been advocated with a view to enabling our continent to \r\nescape from this impasse have, for the most part, proved to be inapplicable \r\nbecause they are inappropriate. The balance of payments of some of our \r\ncountries has been affected by the international monetary system, which \r\ninfluences international exchanges. Therefore, it is urgent that the \r\ninternational community give much more backing to the developing countries, so \r\nthat they and the African countries in particular may participate in world \r\ngrowth. \r\nAfrica, 70 per cent of whose exports consist of prime commodities, has \r\nbeen hard hit by the detrimental effects of the fall in the prices of those \r\ncommodities, and it faces economic problems in addition to that of \r\nindebtedness. Again, Africa has undertaken a programme of economic reform, \r\nwhose results because of the need simultaneously to implement political \r\nreforms and the desire of Governments to achieve consensus in respect of these \r\nprogrammes - have been very slow to emerge. \r\nFor all these reasons the international community should promote action \r\nin three directions. First, it should stabilize, at a remunerative level, the \r\nprices of non-petroleum products; secondly, it should readjust the \r\ninternational monetary system by rationalizing policy on interest and exchange \r\nrates; finally, it should provide a substantial increase in public aid to \r\nAfrican countries. In other words, we are advocating the creation and \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n127 \r\n(Mrs. Bongo. Gabon) \r\nimplementation of a sort of \"Marshall plan\" for the African continent. \r\nGenerally speaking, the problem of combating underdevelopment is of central \r\nconcern to all of mankind. This is why solidarity should not be selective. \r\nNor should it be confined to mere declarations of intent the purpose of which \r\nis to ease one\u0027s conscience. It should, for example, take the form of a \r\nre-initiation of the process of negotiation on commodity agreements. The \r\nsuccess of this new form of cooperation effective solidarity between \r\npeoples will affect the future of our planet and facilitate improvement of \r\nthe human condition. \r\nI am guite certain that no delegation present at this meeting would like \r\nthe cold war to be replaced by North-South confrontation. That being the \r\ncase, it might seem illusory to pose certain problems albeit major problems \r\nconcerning the environment - if, at the same time, solutions are not proposed \r\nfor the benefit of those countries that have to exploit their raw materials in \r\na more or less intensive way. \r\nLet us not be hypocritical. This is a requirement for survival, as was \r\ndemonstrated recently at the Rio summit on the environment and, quite \r\nrecently, at the summit of non-aligned countries. The conditions that are \r\nnecessary for the preservation of the environment, which is the real heritage \r\nof mankind, should not be one-sided. The new concept of international law and \r\nthe new international order, to which I have referred already, can be reviewed \r\nand corrected, and should take into account the new terms of world \r\nequilibrium. Otherwise, economic growth and democratic development will be \r\njeopardized. \r\nPespite the acute nature of the various problems to which I have just \r\nreferred, our Organization has a very gratifying record in the political and \r\ndiplomatic fields. It should also demonstrate its ability to meet the new \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n128 \r\n(Mrs. Bongo. Gabon) \r\nchallenges facing mankind today. These include the questions of the \r\nenvironment, AIPS and drugs. These subjects have introduced a new set of \r\nproblems into international thinking, and they reguire urgent and innovative \r\nsolutions. In this connection, the United Nations Conference on Environment \r\nand Development has proved correct the vision of solidarity of those who have \r\nalways felt that the well-being of nations comes from consultation rather than \r\nconfrontation. \r\nThat Conference was a striking illustration of the ill-adaptedness of the \r\neconomic choices imposed here and there in the world, by comparison with the \r\nresources available on the planet, and, I am guite certain, by comparison with \r\nthe real needs of our populations. The fact that this coincided with the end \r\nof the cold war should make development as important a concept as that of \r\ncollective security, which has always been one of the main concerns of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\nUndoubtedly development was one of the main objectives that the founding \r\nfathers assigned to the Organization, but security needs have pushed \r\ninternational cooperation in this area into the background. Its reinstatement \r\nshould take the form of a crusade against underdevelopment. I should like to \r\nrefer here to the concept of sustainable development, which was mentioned at \r\nRio in connection with my country\u0027s rational use of its forest lands. Gabon, \r\nwhich has long since advanced from the stage of simple harvesting to that of \r\necological management of its forest lands, could not fail to adhere to the two \r\nconventions of Sio the conventions on biodiversity and on climatic changes. \r\nTherefore, we shall be very pleased to host, in Libreville in \r\nJanuary-February 1993, the first African meetings as a follow-up to the Rio \r\nConference, and we extend a cordial welcome to the representatives of \r\nparticipating States, and wish them a pleasant stay in Gabon. \r\nA / 4 7 / P V . 7 \r\n129 \r\n(Mrs. Bongo. Gabon) \r\nI should like to conclude my remarks by calling for more solidarity -\r\nsolidarity in the settlement of disputes, in international security, in \r\nco-operative relations between States and peoples, in relations between \r\ninternational financial institutions, and in relations between all our \r\ncountries, without discrimination. In his report on the activities of the \r\nOrganization the Secretary-General says: \r\n\"We need a new spirit of commonality, commitment and intellectual \r\ncreativity to transform a period of hope into an era of fulfilment.\" \r\n(A/47/1, para. 8) \r\nWe are talking here about the advent of this new international order a world \r\nthat is better and more human, one in which there is real solidarity. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I shall now call on those representatives who wish \r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply. \r\nMay I remind members that, in accordance with General Assembly decision \r\n34/401, statements in exercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes \r\nfor the first intervention and to five minutes for the second and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats. \r\nMr. VYAS (India): Once again my delegation finds itself with no \r\nalternative but to exercise its right of reply to the delegation of Pakistan. \r\nIn the guise of promoting the noble objective of the exercise of the \r\nself-determination of peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign \r\noccupation, Pakistan has chosen to comment on the internal situation in my \r\ncountry. The, inherent contradiction in the position of Pakistan is evident \r\nfrom the fact that, in the same breath, the representative of Pakistan speaks \r\nof the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir as being a case in which the process \r\nof self-determination is to be exercised and as being an outstanding dispute \r\nbetween Pakistan and India. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n130 \r\n. (Mr. Vyas. India) \r\nPakistan must clearly understand that the state of Jammu and Kashmir is \r\nan integral part of India and shall remain so for ever, regardless of \r\nPakistani arguments and manoeuvres. Self-determination does not apply to \r\nintegral parts of a sovereign State. The people of Jammu and Kashmir have \r\nlong enjoyed periodic free and fair elections, unlike their brethren in those \r\nparts of Kashmir that are under illegal Pakistani occupation. \r\nPakistan has also spoken of alleged human-rights violations in Jammu and \r\nKashmir. The truth of the matter is that Pakistan is openly interfering in \r\nIndia\u0027s internal affairs through its active involvement with terrorist and \r\nsecessionist elements, who are trained, armed, supplied and sustained by \r\nPakistan, and who infiltrate across the border into India, particularly into \r\nKashmir. The aim and objective of these infiltrators is to undermine the \r\nfoundations of our democratic State by resorting to criminal methods to \r\nterrorize the innocent civilian population. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n131 \r\n(Mr. Vyas. India) \r\nThere is overwhelming independent corroboration and testimony, often \r\nbased on eye-witness accounts by respected international observers and by the \r\npress, of Pakistan\u0027s involvement. Just one of these was the report of the \r\nUnited States Department of State \"Patterns of Global Terrorism for 1991\", \r\nwhich was issued in April this year. That report states categorically: \r\n\"There were continuing credible reports throughout 1991 of official \r\nPakastani support for Kashmiri militant groups engaged in terrorism in \r\nIndian-controlled Kashmir, as well as support to Sikh militant groups \r\nengaged in terrorism in Indian Punjab.\" \r\nThe report refers also to the provision of weapons and training by Pakistan to \r\nthese groups. \r\nThe terrorist actions sponsored by Pakistan have ruined the economy of \r\nthe valley and have forced thousand of innocent persons, both Hindu and \r\nMuslim, into other parts of India. Pakistan speaks of its desire to commence \r\na bilateral dialogue in accordance with the Simla agreement, but at the same \r\ntime it violates the Simla agreement itself, which is a mutually agreed upon \r\nframework for the conduct of good-neighbourly relations and for the resolution \r\nof bilateral issues, and which asks for the prevention of acts detrimental to \r\nthe maintenance of peaceful and harmonious relations. \r\nWe still hope that Pakistan will realize the gravity of its actions and \r\nwill return to the Simla agreement in letter and spirit. \r\nMr. KHAN (Pakistan): The representative of India, in what is now a \r\nfamiliar but an unconvincing style of reasoning, has tried to divert the \r\nattention of this body from the harsh realities in Indian-held Kashmir by \r\nadvancing misleading arguments and levelling baseless allegations against my \r\ncountry. \r\nI I I I I \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n132 \r\n(Mr. Khan. Pakistan) \r\nWe have time and again tried to put the facts in their correct legal and \r\nmoral perspective, and have categorically rejected the unfounded allegations \r\nagainst Pakistan. We do so again in the hope that the representative of India \r\nwill see the situation in the Indian-occupied Kashmir as the world sees it, \r\nand will not close his eyes to the facts of history and those contained in the \r\nrecords of this very Organization. \r\nThe representative of India has called Kashmir an integral part of \r\nIndia. Nothing could be further from the truth. Contrary to what India may \r\nlike us to believe, Kashmir remains a disputed territory, and it is recognized \r\nas such by the United Nations. There are no legal, political or moral grounds \r\nfor India to claim otherwise. No one can deny that the dispute is still on \r\nthe agenda of the Security Council and that the relevant resolutions of the \r\nSecurity Council and the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan on \r\nthe Kashmir dispute remain unimplemented. These resolutions called for the \r\ndetermination of the future disposition of Kashmir on the basis of the wishes \r\nof the Kashmiri people, expressed through a free and impartial plebiscite held \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations. These resolutions remain as \r\nrelevant and valid today as they were when first adopted. \r\nLet me remind the Indian representative of one of the many statements \r\nmade by India\u0027s leaders on its commitment to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir. In \r\n1952 the late Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru stated before the Indian \r\nParliament: \r\n\"I want to stress that it is only the people of Kashmir who can decide \r\nthe future of Kashmir. It is not that we have merely said that in the \r\nUnited Nations and to the people of Kashmir; it is our conviction, and \r\none that is borne out by the policy that we have pursued, not only in \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n133 \r\n(Mr. Khan. Pakistan) \r\nKashmir but everywhere. I started with the presumption that it is for \r\nthe people of Kashmir to decide their own future. We will not compel \r\nthem. In that sense the people of Kashmir are sovereign.\" \r\nKashmir is a disputed territory, and it is not an integral part of India. Any \r\nassertion to the contrary only militates against the legality of the Security \r\nCouncil resolutions. \r\nThe Indian representative, in his endeavour to present a distorted \r\npicture of the spontaneous indigenous and popular uprising in the Indian-held \r\nKashmir, has alleged that it was Pakistan which was instigating and abetting \r\nthe so-called terrorism in the territory. These charges are diametrically \r\nopposed to the reality on the ground. While rejecting such unfounded charges \r\nas baseless, I should like to reiterate Pakistan\u0027s repeated offers to India \r\nfor establishing a neutral mechanism such as the stationing of impartial \r\ninternational observers along the line of control to monitor, carry out \r\nsurveillance and investigate the situation and reach independent conclusions. \r\nIndia\u0027s rejection of such a constructive proposal lays bare the \r\nhollowness of its allegations and reveals its true intent to divert world \r\nattention from the gruesome situation in Indian-occupied Kashmir. In any \r\nevent, the line of control is one of the most heavily guarded and patrolled \r\nareas in the world, and it is almost impossible for anyone to get across the \r\nline unnoticed and unchallenged. \r\nThe fact is that the people of Indian-held Kashmir have risen up after \r\nyears of suppression at the hands of the Indian authorities and are demanding \r\ntheir inalienable right to self-determination. In reply to this demand, the \r\nGovernment of India has unleased a dark reign of terror and brutal oppression, \r\nI I I I \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n134-135 \r\n(Mr. Khan. Pakistan) \r\nin which more than 10,000 innocent Kashmiri men, women and children have been \r\nkilled, thousands have been maimed, many more are being subjected to inhuman \r\ntorture, hundreds of women have been molested, and scores of neighbourhoods \r\nhave been set to the torch. \r\nThe Simla agreement of 1972 between India and Pakistan, to which India \r\nrefers so often, in no way altered the status of the territory, which \r\ncontinues to remain a disputed territory. On the contrary, the agreement \r\nrecognized the Kashmir dispute as an outstanding issue awaiting peaceful \r\nsettlement. The Simla agreement also clearly provided that the United Nations \r\nCharter shall govern relations between the parties. Furthermore, the \r\nagreement does not exclude resort to means of pacific settlement of disputes, \r\nas provided in the Charter. The Indian representative is therefore wrong in \r\nsaying that Pakistan has departed from the letter and spirit of the Simla \r\nagreement by raising the issue in the United Nations. \r\nPakistan, for its part, remains committed to a peaceful settlement of the \r\nKashmir dispute, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security \r\nCouncil and the United Nations Commission on India and Pakistan and in the \r\nspirit of the Simla agreement. \r\nMr. VYAS (India): I have no intention of prolonging this exchange \r\nwith Pakistan at this hour. The inherent contradictions in the statement of \r\nthe representative of Pakistan are quite clear. No amount of misleadinq \r\npropaganda will alter the position that Jammu and Kashmir is, and will always \r\nremain, an integral part of India. The people of Kashmir have freely decided, \r\nthrough the democratic process, to fuse their destiny with the destiny of \r\nIndia. The only people of Kashmir who have not been permitted to do so are \r\nthe inhabitants of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The only dispute that remains \r\nin Kashmir is the vacation of Pakistani aggression. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n136 \r\n(Mr. Vvas. India) \r\nIndia and Pakistan, and indeed this Assembly, have far more constructive \r\nthings to do than to go through this futile exercise every year. Pakistan is \r\naware of India\u0027s many proposals to improve bilateral relations and boost \r\nmutual confidence, and stands ready to work with Pakistan once it clarifies \r\nits intentions in this regard and acts accordingly for the benefit of both \r\ncountries and the region. \r\nMr. KHAN (Pakistan): The representative of India cannot deny the \r\ncontinued perpetration of massive violations of human rights in Indian-held \r\nKashmir, nor can his isolated voice claiming Kashmir to be an integral part of \r\nIndia alter the status of the territory recognized as disputed by the United \r\nNations. \r\nThe facts are simple, clear, well-known and on the record of the United \r\nNations. The future of Jammu and Kashmir has to be determined in accordance \r\nwith the wishes of the Kashmiri people expressed through a free and impartial \r\nplebiscite held under United Nations auspices. \r\nNo amount of coercion can suppress for long a people seeking their right \r\nto self-determination. Pakistan seeks good—neighbourly relations with India \r\nand has always endeavoured to enter into a constructive dialogue with it with \r\na view to resolving peacefully all outstanding disputes, including that of \r\nJammu and Kashmir, on the basis of justice and fair play. \r\nAt the Non-Aligned Summit Meeting earlier this month, the Prime Minister \r\nof Pakistan called upon his Indian counterpart to work with him towards an \r\nequitable solution to this potentially explosive issue in accordance with the \r\nrelevant resolutions of the Security Council and in the spirit of the Simla \r\nagreement. We also invited the Indian Prime Minister to join him in erecting \r\na new structure of peaceful cooperation between the two countries based on \r\nI I I I I I \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n137-140 \r\n(Mr. Khan. Pakistan) \r\nsovereign equality, mutual benefit, pacific settlement of disputes and \r\nnon-interference in internal affairs. \r\nWe take this opportunity to reiterate to the representative of India the \r\nsentiments expressed by Pakistan\u0027s Prime Minister during the Non-Aligned \r\nSummit in Jakarta. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n141 \r\nThe meeting was suspended at 8.05 p.m. and resumed at 8.30 p.m.* \r\nAGENDA ITEM 8 (continued) \r\nADOPTION OF THE AGENDA AND ORGANIZATION OF WORK \r\n(a) LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL (A/47/456) \r\n(b) DRAFT RESOLUTION (A/47/L.1) \r\nThe PRESIDENT: In connection with the consideration of this item a \r\nletter addressed to me by the President of the Security Council has been \r\ncirculated in document A/47/456. The General Assembly also has before it a \r\ndraft resolution issued as document A/47/L.1. \r\nI call on the representative of the United Kingdom to introduce the draft \r\nresolution \r\nSir David HANNAY (United Kingdom): I have the honour to introduce \r\ndraft resolution A/47/L.1. In addition to the 12 States members of the \r\nEuropean Community, in whose name I speak, and of Morocco, the following \r\nMember States have become sponsors of the draft resolution: Afghanistan, \r\nAlbania, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, the \r\nComoros, Croatia, Egypt, Finland, Iceland, the Islamic Republic of Iran, \r\nJordan, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, Malta, Mauritania, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, \r\nPakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Slovenia, Sweden, Tunisia, Turkey, the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates and the United States of America. \r\nOn 19 September the Security Council adopted resolution 777 (1992). In \r\nthe preamble the Council considered that the State formerly known as the \r\nSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had ceased to exist and recalled its \r\nresolution 757 (1992), which noted that the claim to continuity had not been \r\ngenerally accepted. In the first operative paragraph, the Council considering \r\nThe President returned to the Chair. \r\ni i i i i \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n142 \r\n(Sir David Hannay, United Kingdom) \r\nthat the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cannot \r\ncontinue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic \r\nof Yugoslavia in the United Nations, recommended to the Assembly that it \r\ndecide that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) shall \r\nnot participate in the work of the Assembly and should apply for membership in \r\nthe United Nations. \r\nBy adopting the draft resolution before us today, the Assembly would thus \r\nact upon the recommendation of the Council and in this way follow the \r\nprocedure laid down in the Charter for membership guestions. The text before \r\nus does two things. First, the Assembly would decide that the Federal \r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) shall not participate in the \r\nwork of the General Assembly: this means in particular that no representative \r\nof the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) will sit in the \r\nseat of Yugoslavia in any organ of the Assembly. Second, the Assembly would \r\ndecide that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should \r\napply for membership in the United Nations. In other words, as regards the \r\nneed to submit an application for membership, the Federal Republic of \r\nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) is in precisely the same position as other \r\ncomponents of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Croatia, \r\nSlovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina each duly submitted applications in \r\naccordance with the Charter and were admitted to membership earlier this \r\nyear. If and when an application is submitted by the Federal Republic of \r\nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) it would likewise be considered in \r\naccordance with the Charter. The conditions for admission to membership set \r\nout in Article 4 of the Charter are clear: the applicant must be a \r\npeace-loving State; it must accept the obligations contained in the Charter; \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n143 \r\n(Sir David Hannay. United Kingdom) \r\nand it must, in the judgment of the Organization, be able and willing to carry \r\nout these obligations. \r\nIn operative paragraph 2 of the draft resolution the Assembly takes note \r\nof the intention of the Security Council to consider the matter again before \r\nthe end of the main part of the forty-seventh session that is to say, before \r\nthe session recesses in the second half of December. The fact that the \r\nCouncil is ready to consider the matter again within the next three months is \r\nsignificant. The tragic situation in the former Yugoslavia is a matter of the \r\nhighest concern to all members of the international community. The \r\nInternational Conference on the former Yugoslavia, which opened in London on \r\n26 August and which now meets in Geneva, brings together the efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations and the European Community. We must do everything in our power \r\nto encourage the parties, with the assistance of the Conference Co-Chairmen, \r\nto settle their differences at the negotiating table, not on the battlefield. \r\nThat the Council has decided to consider the matter again before the end of \r\nthe year will, we trust, be a helpful incentive to all the parties concerned, \r\nand an effective means of support to the Co-Chairmen of the Conference on \r\nYugoslavia in their heavy task. \r\nIn conclusion let me say that it gives me, and those who have also \r\nsponsored the draft resolution, no pleasure to have to introduce this draft \r\nresolution today. It would have been far preferable if it had not been \r\nnecessary to go through this process, if the Belgrade authorities had accepted \r\nthat they had to\u0027apply for membership on the same footing as other components \r\nof the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In no sense is this \r\ndraft resolution a punitive measure, nor one designed to undermine the peace \r\nprocess. Quite the contrary. It is a measure that we have been forced to \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n144-145 \r\n(Sir David Hannay. United Kingdom) \r\ntake by the completely unjustified claim by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \r\n(Serbia and Montenegro) to represent the continuity of the Socialist Federal \r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. The situation is without precedent and was clearly \r\nnot foreseen by the authors of the Charter. But the sponsors are satisfied \r\nthat the Council and the Assembly must by necessary implication have the power \r\nunder the Charter to act in this way in this unforeseen situation. \r\nThe way ahead is in the hands of the authorities in Belgrade. It is for \r\nthem to draw the logical conclusion from the decision which the Assembly is \r\nbeing invited to take. It is for the authorities in Belgrade to convince the \r\nUnited Nations that they meet the reguirements for admission to membership. \r\nOn behalf of the sponsors I commend draft resolution A/47/L.1 to the \r\nAssembly. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: The next speaker is the Prime Minister of the \r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia, Mr. Milan Panic, who has expressed the wish to \r\nmake a statement on the item under consideration,and I now call on him. \r\nMr. PANIC (Yugoslavia): I sincerely appreciate this opportunity to \r\naddress the Assembly today on behalf of the people of Yugoslavia. I wish \r\nparticularly to congratulate you. Sir, on your election to the high and noble \r\nposition of the presidency, and I am sure that you will greatly help the \r\nsmooth and efficient running of this session of the General Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n146 \r\n(Mr. Panic. Yugoslavia) \r\nThe issue before the Assembly now is: more peace or more war? Yesterday \r\nthe Assembly heard the President of a country that is a neighbour of mine \r\nargue in favour of more war. Today I shall present the Assembly with an \r\nargument and a programme for more peace. \r\nThe Assembly has also heard arguments here for not accepting the \r\nparticipation of Yugoslavia in the noble work of the United Nations. At the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on refugees in Geneva in late July, I said that I \r\naccepted not being accepted, and asked the representatives to stop the \r\npolitics and start talking about refugee problems. Some members may know that \r\nI have some understanding of how a refugee feels, because I myself was a \r\npolitical refugee from Tito\u0027s Yugoslavia, and I lived in a refugee camp in \r\nGermany. I have some of the same feelings today: too many are talking \r\npolitics when they should be talking peace. \r\nFrom the first day that my new Government of Yugoslavia took office, two \r\nmonths ago, we have cooperated with the United Nations in every way possible. \r\nHe will continue to do so regardless of the action that the Assembly takes \r\nhere today. My only goal is to restore peace and stability to the Balkans. \r\nWe are now at a turning point when this great Organization devoted to \r\npeace must decide whether peace is furthered by sending arms in or taking arms \r\nout. The Balkans are already polluted with too many weapons. It is in a \r\nsense an environmental problem of tragic proportions. \r\nPlease hear my message. Do not authorize the means for a broadening of \r\nthe conflict. We need more United Nations monitors and peace-keeping forces \r\nin the Balkans, not more arms for the parties to the conflict. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n147 \r\n(Mr. Panic. Yugoslavia) \r\nLet us devise a creative and effective means of controlling and removing \r\nthe arms that are already there. My Government will cooperate fully with the \r\nUnited Nations in any manner it wishes in order to bring the weapons under \r\ncontrol and end the fighting and killing. \r\nWe have repeatedly offered to accept United Nations monitors at our \r\nairfields and on our borders. In London, on 26 August, I requested that \r\nseveral thousand peace-keeping forces be sent to patrol our borders, and \r\noffered to help the United Nations with logistical support to cover some of \r\nthe expenses. I renew that request now. \r\nI ask members to come to Yugoslavia and assure themselves that no support \r\nis flowing from Yugoslavia to cqmbatants in Bosnia or Croatia. My Government \r\nhas given orders to stop any support for combatants in Bosnia and Croatia, \r\nbut, as in many other parts of the world, we still have some militant \r\nnationalists who defy our orders. We need the help of the United Nations. We \r\nwelcome its help. Let me repeat: Please come as peacemakers, not as \r\nsuppliers of weapons for those who wish to fight. \r\nLet us also look at the facts of the situation with regard to foreign \r\ntroops in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I assure the Assembly that all Yugoslav \r\ntroops have been withdrawn from Bosnia. United Nations Command has confirmed \r\nthis. A New York Times article of 19 September, based largely on United \r\nStates and British intelligence sources, said that the Yugoslav army had been \r\nwithdrawn from Bosnia on 19 May, and that nearly all of the irregulars from \r\nBosnia had been withdrawn. The same article said that 30,000 regular and \r\n10,000 irregular Croatian troops are fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I \r\nstate that strictly for factual reasons and not to exacerbate the situation \r\nwith Croatia. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n148 \r\n(Mr. Panic. Yugoslavia) \r\nYet Croatia sits in here in the Assembly, not subject to any criticism or \r\nsanction. I admit that I am new to international affairs, but this looks like \r\na double standard to me. \r\nI call upon the United Nations to demand that all foreign troops and \r\nirregular volunteers be withdrawn from Bosnia and Herzegovina immediately \r\nunder threat of the imposition of sanctions. That would be even-handed and \r\npart of the peace process. \r\nI should like to address the guestion of continuity and recognition of \r\nnew countries that were once republics of the former Yugoslavia. The position \r\nof my Government on recognition has been clearly stated on several occasions \r\nin recent weeks. We recognize borders between republics that were established \r\nby Tito\u0027s Communist regime as now being international borders. I declare once \r\nagain here that Yugoslavia has no territorial claims against any of its \r\nneighbours. \r\nWe have negotiated most of the issues in our relationship with Croatia, \r\nwe believe, and hope that we will soon reach agreement with Croatia on mutual \r\nrecognition. We have stated that we recognize the State of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina and its existing borders and are prepared to recognize its \r\nGovernment when all three ethnic communities in Bosnia reach an agreement on \r\nthe organization of their State or Government. \r\nThe problems of the Government of Bosnia must be resolved by the \r\nBosnians - all, the Bosnians. The problem is not in Belgrade, as claimed \r\nyesterday by the President of Bosnia: the problem lies in Sarajevo. The \r\nGovernment of Bosnia represented here in this body must convince all the \r\npeople of Bosnia that it truly represents their interests. That is the road \r\nto peace in Bosnia. They must truly represent the interests of Serbs, Croats \r\nand Muslims. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n149 \r\n(Mr. Panic. Yugoslavia) \r\nBut I do not wish to speak for Bosnia, or for all of Yugoslavia. I speak \r\nonly for the new Yugoslavia, whose Government I represent. The Constitution \r\nof Yugoslavia vests the conduct of foreign relations in the Yugoslav \r\nGovernment. The two constituent republics, Serbia and Montenegro, have no \r\nlegal role in the foreign affairs of Yugoslavia. \r\nWorld leaders and representatives of international organizations meet \r\nwith me and ask my help in stopping the fighting in Bosnia and ending the fear \r\nof Serbian territorial expansion, but they give me no help or support with \r\nrespect to my internal struggle, in Yugoslavia. With those militant \r\nnationalists who oppose my policies of peace, they even bolster the position \r\nof my principal internal opponents by meeting with them on their visits to \r\nYugoslavia. Please stop this. Hold me and my Government responsible and \r\naccountable for the policies and actions of Yugoslavia, but give us the help \r\nand international recognition we need in pursuing our programme of peace. \r\nI herewith formally request membership in the United Nations on behalf of \r\nthe new Yugoslavia, whose Government I represent. I am certain that my \r\ncountry and my Government satisfy the conditions for membership at least as \r\nwell as the countries and Governments many here today represent. Yugoslavia \r\nwas a founding Member of the United Nations and has always lived up to its \r\nprinciples. My Government honours those principles and struggles to uphold \r\nthem under very difficult circumstances. I seek the Assembly\u0027s support and \r\nrecognition. Do not undermine a man of peace and the peace-loving Yugoslavs. \r\nOne of the major concerns of the world with regard to Yugoslavia is \r\n\"ethnic cleansing\" and the hundreds of thousands of refugees created by this \r\nvile practice. \"Ethnic cleansing\" is a horrible, unacceptable and \r\nunforgivable practice. I have moved actively against it in Yugoslavia. I \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n150 \r\n(Mr. Panic. Yugoslavia) \r\nrecently fired the Vice-Minister of Internal Affairs, who failed to support my \r\nGovernment programme of opposition to \"ethnic cleansing\". I had the Mayor and \r\nthree others arrested and put in jail in a town where \"ethnic cleansing\" had \r\nbeen practised against Croatians. Wherever it occurs, in any of the republics \r\nof the old Yugoslavia, \"ethnic cleansing\" must be stopped and reversed. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n151 \r\n(Mr. Panic. Yugoslavia) \r\nBut in our reaction to the horrors of \"ethnic cleansing\" let us guard \r\nagainst slipping into intolerance. We must not permit the war in Bosnia to \r\nbecome a religious war, a war of Muslims against Christians, supported from \r\noutside by other Muslims and Christians. Surely the United Nations must rise \r\nabove this. The Organization was founded in opposition to the religious and \r\nracial intolerance that produced the Second World War. This Organization must \r\nstand for peace and tolerance everywhere. There is no place in the modern \r\nworld for religious blocs. \r\nPlease forgive a personal note on tolerance. I am Serbian Orthodox. My \r\nwife is Catholic. My daughter is married to a Muslim. I have two Muslim \r\ngrandchildren. I have Croatians among my ancestors. Personally and \r\nphilosophically, I am opposed to ethnic and religious intolerance. \r\nI believe that in the post-Communist era the major Powers have a special \r\nresponsibility to ensure the stable political and economic transformation of \r\nemerging democracies. They must take particular care to promote ethnic and \r\nreligious tolerance and to guard against being influenced in carrying out that \r\nresponsibility by pressure exerted by special-interest blocs or nations. \r\nEither we are all equal or some are more equal than others. I, of course, \r\nprefer the former option. Let me emphasize that without true tolerance, we \r\ncannot have true peace. \r\nIt is difficult to preach tolerance to those who are suffering under \r\neconomic sanctions that have not been applied in an evenhanded way to all of \r\nthe parties to the conflict. But my Government does preach tolerance, because \r\nit is right to do so and because tolerance leads to peace. \r\nOnce again let me emphasize that my message today is a message of peace. \r\nMy Government is pursuing a programme of peace, and we need the help and \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n152 \r\n(Mr. Panic. Yugoslavia) \r\nunderstanding of this body. The Assembly\u0027s acceptance of the transformation \r\nwe are seeking to implement and its recognition would further the cause of \r\npeace. I fear that its rejection would impair it. \r\nI should like to draw attention to a resolution that the Yugoslav Federal \r\nAssembly approved today, which clearly emphasize the grave concern over the \r\ndraft resolution on the membership of Yugoslavia in the United Nations. The \r\nresolution is available here, and I ask that it receive due attention. In the \r\nname of peace, I thank representatives for listening to what I have had to say. \r\nMr. NOBILO (Croatia): The draft resolution we are discussing \r\ntonight is the last act in the international delegitimization of the former \r\nSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but not, unfortunately, the end of \r\nthe great suffering of the people of the Republic of Croatia and the Republic \r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, victims of Serbian aggression. \r\nThe delegitimization of Yugoslavia and the non-violent transformation of \r\nthe area into sovereign States enjoying good-neighbourly relations could have \r\nbeen resolved peacefully and without bloodshed. The hesitation and doubts of \r\nthe international community, its avoidance of a timely and resolute response \r\nto an aggressive, imperial policy aimed at creating Greater Serbia and the \r\nglobal community\u0027s failure to recognize the elementary right of nations to \r\nself-determination unfortunately contributed indirectly to the tragedy of war. \r\nCroatia is not witnessing the expulsion of Serbia and Montenegro from the \r\nGeneral Assembly with a feeling of triumph, though it considers itself the \r\nmoral and political victor in the war that was forced upon it. For us, this \r\nis an act that both resolves the legal dilemma of the status of the former \r\nYugoslav States and clarifies the issues concerning the succession of \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n153-155 \r\n(Mr. Nobilo. Croatia) \r\nStates in the area. We also appeal to other United Nations bodies to adhere \r\nto the provisions of the draft resolution we are adopting. \r\nCroatia understands the pragmatic tone of the draft resolution, but \r\nwishes to reiterate that a clear line should be drawn between necessary \r\npolitical pragmatism and harmful compromises (that the Belgrade regime \r\ninterprets as weakness on the part of the global community and a stimulus to \r\ncontinue its aggression. Because of this, Croatia looks forward to the \r\nconsistent implementation of Security Council resolution 777 (1992) and of the \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution we are about to adopt. \r\nThe lowering of the flag of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \r\nin front of the United Nations building not only represents the first symbolic \r\nstep in the implementation of those documents, but is a legal and logical \r\nnecessity, because Belgrade has itself renounced the very same flag. \r\nConsistent implementation of the resolution would also imply respect for \r\nall criteria regarding the admission of Serbia and Montenegro to the United \r\nNations. Croatia is prepared to vote in favour of their admission to the \r\nUnited Nations, but only after they have met all the criteria regarding, \r\nfirst, the cessation of aggression against neighbouring States as well as \r\nrecognition of their sovereignty and territorial integrity within existing \r\nborders, internal democratization and protection of human rights and the \r\nrights of minorities. \r\nCroatia is a sponsor of the draft resolution and will vote for it in the \r\nbelief that it will play a pivotal role in resolving the issue of succession \r\nand contribute to the success of the Geneva negotiations and to a \r\ncomprehensive solution of the crisis in this part of Europe. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n156 \r\nMr. SACIRBEY (Bosnia and Herzegovina): By the democratic \r\nexpressions of the constituent peoples of its now-sovereign States and Members \r\nof the United Nations, the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has \r\nceased to exist. Serbia and Montenegro are not legally entitled to succeed to \r\nthe position of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This is \r\napplicable to this body as well as to other related and similar international \r\norganizations. We would hope that such organizations will follow the \r\nprecedent that will be established here tonight. \r\nOur support for such steps is not motivated by vengefulness. We are \r\ncommitted to the orderly process of succession. Serbia and Montenegro cannot \r\npreempt this orderly process of succession by unilateral action. We must \r\nemphasize that we look forward to the day when Serbia and Montenegro join the \r\ncommunity of States in the United Nations and this Assembly, and we look \r\nforward to their being held to the same standards as we all were required to \r\nmeet upon our admission to the United Nations. \r\nTherefore, we trust that the record of the present regime in Serbia and \r\nMontenegro with respect to human rights abuses and aggression against its \r\nneighbours will at that time have been remedied. \r\nI wish the Prime Minister of the so-called Yugoslavia the best in \r\novercoming, as he puts it, the militants in his country. I wish him the best \r\nin, as he puts it, his efforts as a man of peace. But we must deal with the \r\nunfortunate and tragic truth in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We do not have peace \r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina. We do not seek war, but we do seek the means to \r\nbring peace to our country. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n157 \r\n(Mr. Sacirbey. Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina) \r\nIt is not true that aggression against our country has stopped. Daily, \r\nplanes of the Yugoslav People\u0027s Army fly against our cities and against our \r\npeople. Daily, new weapons and troops are introduced into our republic. \r\nWe, the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, have a legal Government; that \r\nGovernment deserves to be recognized by all its neighbours in order to promote \r\npeace. It is a Government composed of Serbs, Croats and Muslims. Those who \r\noppose it are involved in aggression against our people and against our very \r\nexistence. \r\nWe are hopeful that our actions here this evening will not only establish \r\nan orderly succession for the former Yugoslavia, but also help promote peace, \r\nbasic human rights and stability in our region. Therefore, we offer our \r\nsupport for this draft resolution. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: We have heard the last speaker in the debate on this \r\nitem. We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution A/47/L.1. Before \r\ncalling on the first speaker in explanation of vote before the voting, let me \r\nremind delegations that, in accordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, \r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats. \r\nMr. IBN CHAMBAS (Ghana): My delegation. Sir, will have a more \r\nauspicious occasion to congratulate you on your election to the high office of \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. \r\nThe situation in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a \r\nmajor development that is likely to influence in a significant way the \r\noutlines of the new world order we seek to establish. The world has justly \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n158-160 \r\n(Mr. Ibn Chambas.Ghana) \r\ncondemned the atrocities that are being perpetrated by all sides in the \r\nconflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. \"Ethnic cleansing\" is abhorrent and can \r\nonly return the world to the chaos of the First and Second World Wars. The \r\nUnited Nations has an obligation to put a stop to it. It is a denial of the \r\ndignity and worth of the human person and of the most basic human rights. \r\nGhana believes that the purposes of the United Nations could be better \r\nserved by including all States in the membership of the Organization. \r\nArticles 4, 5 and 6 of the Charter not only aspire to include all States in \r\ninternational efforts to achieve peace and prosperity, but also, and more \r\nimportantly, point the way to measures that can be taken to sanction any State \r\nthat goes against the obligations of membership. It cannot and should not be \r\nthe intent of those Articles to deny membership wilfully and capriciously to \r\nany State. \r\nIn anticipation of the situation that now faces our Organization, in \r\nwhich a Member State has undergone territorial or constitutional changes, the \r\nGeneral Assembly determined in 1947 that as a general rule such a State should \r\nnot cease to be a Member simply by virtue of such changes. We wish to read \r\ninto that determination the desire to promote universality in the membership \r\nof our Organization. \r\nThe Yugoslav situation also brings into focus the relationship the United \r\nNations should maintain with regional arrangements or agencies, as envisaged \r\nin Chapter VIII of the Charter. The prejudicial actions or measures that were \r\ntaken in the name of regional security arrangements have not promoted the \r\nsearch for peace in Yugoslavia. Regional arrangements or agencies, and their \r\nactivities, should be consistent with the purposes and principles of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n161 \r\n(Mr. Ibn Chambas. Ghana) \r\nAbove all, the United Nations should be, and should also be seen to be, a \r\ncentre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of our common \r\nends. \r\nAnother consideration that has influenced our position on the draft \r\nresolution relates to the respective mandates of the Charter organs, in this \r\ncase the unacceptable presumption that the Security Council can make \r\nrecommendations to the General Assembly on who can participate in its work. \r\nThe Security Council was given primary responsibility for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security simply to facilitate speedy action by our \r\nOrganization in the event of crisis. The delegation of responsibility by the \r\nGeneral Assembly to the Security Council cannot and should not extend to \r\nresponsibility for participation in the work of other organs. \r\nThe draft resolution before us does not reflect any principled position \r\nin terms of the Charter. Nor is it likely to advance the search for peace in \r\nYugoslavia. It may even undermine current endeavours. It also subtracts from \r\nour efforts towards the democratization of the United Nations. The expanded \r\nrole the Security Council has implicitly given itself may compromise the \r\ncherished principle of universality, which could become subject to the veto \r\npower wielded by a few members of the Security Council. \r\nAs a small developing country, Ghana seeks refuge in international law \r\nand the principles of the United Nations Charter. My country\u0027s foreign policy \r\nreflects the consistent application of principle. The draft resolution before \r\nus may be pragmatic, but it cannot be said to be principled, logical or \r\nconsistent to the extent that it allows for Yugoslav participation in the work \r\nof our Organization, other than that of the General Assembly. Principle \r\nshould not be made to yield to temporary expediency. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n162 \r\n(Mr. Ibn Chambas. Ghana) \r\nFor all those reasons, which are relevant to our efforts to establish a \r\nnew order that will reflect a greater degree of transparency and enjoy the \r\nconfidence of all Members of the United Nations, Ghana has decided to abstain \r\nin the vote on draft resolution A/47/L.1. \r\nMr. MUMBENGEGWI (Zimbabwe): When, three days ago, the Security \r\nCouncil adopted its resolution 777 (1992), whose provisions are now reflected \r\nin draft resolution A/47/L.1, on which the General Assembly is about to take a \r\nvote, Zimbabwe expressed a number of fundamental concerns. Since then, my \r\ndelegation has listened very carefully to the explanations made by the \r\nsponsors of the draft resolution before us. Nothing they have said has \r\nallayed any of the concerns that have been a source of preoccupation for my \r\ndelegation. \r\nFirst, this Organization has a well-thought-out and well-written \r\nCharter. It is the Charter that should guide all decisions of the United \r\nNations. The principles governing membership of the United Nations are \r\nclearly spelled out in Articles 4, 5 and 6 of the Charter. The text of the \r\ndraft resolution before us makes no reference to any provision of the Charter \r\nunder which the proposed action would be taken. Strict adherence to the \r\nprovisions of the Charter, especially where membership of this universal \r\nOrganization is concerned, is the only sure source of protection for small and \r\notherwise vulnerable States. Any improvisations are bound to protect the \r\ninterests of the large and the powerful at the expense of the small and the \r\nweak. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n163 \r\n(Mr. Mumbengegwi. Zimbabwe) \r\nSecondly, the draft resolution before us sets a very dangerous precedent, \r\nespecially, I dare say, for States whose present composition is diverse and \r\nmulti-ethnic. In the past the General Assembly has operated on the principle \r\nthat a Member of the United Nations does not cease to be a Member simply \r\nbecause its consitution or its frontiers or indeed its name has been \r\nsubject to change. Departure from this practice is bound to open a Pandora\u0027s \r\nbox with dire consequences for the United Nations. \r\nThirdly, the provision that would deprive the Federal Republic of \r\nYuqoslavia of its right to participate in the work of the General Assembly on \r\nthe grounds that the guestion of succession of the former Yugoslavia has not \r\nyet been settled is being applied selectively. Three of the other constituent \r\nrepublics of the former Yugoslavia are already full participants in the work \r\nof the General Assembly. My delegation fully supported such participation by \r\nSlovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. My delegation believes that \r\nall the republics of the former Yugoslavia, including Serbia and Montenegro, \r\nshould be allowed to participate fully in the work of the General Assembly. \r\nThis is consistent with our view of the universality of this world body. \r\nThere are many Members seated here tonight which are products of the \r\nbreakup of States. The remaining part has always retained both its seat in \r\nthis Hall and its name, if it so desired. The breakaway part has always \r\napplied for, and has been granted, its own seat in the Assembly under a new \r\nname of its own choice. Never before has the guestion of succession been \r\nbrought up in a draft resolution before the Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n164-165 \r\n(Mr. Mumbengegwi. Zimbabwe) \r\nFourthly, provisions of the draft resolution are far more severe and far \r\nmore drastic than those that deprived the South African regime, whose policies \r\nand practices had been declared by the international community to be a crime \r\nagainst humanity, of the right to participate in the work of the General \r\nAssembly. South Africa\u0027s resumption of participation is subject to the \r\nappropriate majority vote in the General Assembly only,* while the draft \r\nresolution before us requires that Yugoslavia\u0027s application be subject to the \r\nappropriate majority votes both in the Security Council - where the veto power \r\npossessed by a few members can be exercised - and in the General Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n166 \r\n(Mr. Mumbengegwi. Zimbabwe) \r\nFifthly, Zimbabwe is extremely concerned at the implications for the \r\nGeneral Assembly if the draft resolution were to be adopted. Adoption would \r\nmean that the timing of the resumption of the participation of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia in the work of the General Assembly would ceases to be \r\na General Assembly matter, as it is in the case of South Africa. It would \r\nbecome a Security Council matter an unprecedented abdication of \r\nresponsibility by this universal body. \r\nFinally, Zimbabwe believes that the provisions of the draft resolution \r\nbefore us are likely to have a negative impact on the United Nations efforts \r\nat reconciliation and peacemaking that are currently under way in the region. \r\nWe believe that this is the most inappropriate time to bring such a draft \r\nresolution before the United Nations, which is one of the mediating parties in \r\nthe conflict. \r\nFor those reasons, my delegation will, with regret, be unable to support \r\nthe draft resolution before us. \r\nMr. APALA (Kenya): My delegation has carefully examined the draft \r\nresolution before the Assembly as well as the accompanying letter contained in \r\ndocument A/47/456. We have also examined the provisions of the Charter \r\nrelevant to the draft resolution before us. We have come to the conclusion \r\nthat the Security Council has not acted in strict observance of its mandate \r\nunder the Charter, by recommending to the General Assembly that it decide that \r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia shall not participate in the work of the \r\nAssembly without first submitting an application for membership in the United \r\nNations. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n167 \r\n(Mr. Adala. Kenya) \r\nAdoption of this draft resolution would be tantamount to either the \r\nsuspension of a Member State from the exercise of the rights and privileges of \r\nmembership, as provided for in Article 5 of the Charter, or the expulsion of a \r\nMember from the Organization, as provided for in Article 6. \r\nThe draft resolution before us is silent on which of those Articles of \r\nthe Charter applies or could be applied in the case of the Federal Republic of \r\nYugoslavia, and which would warrant the Security Council\u0027s recommendation or \r\nform the basis of action by the General Assembly. \r\nMoreover, it is highly surprising to my delegation that such a serious \r\nand weighty decision should have been brought before the Assembly under a \r\nprocedural, housekeeping item of the agenda, item 8, \"Adoption of the agenda \r\nand organization of work\". \r\nWe would like to reaffirm our faith in the Charter of the Organization. \r\nWe hold the Security Council in very high esteem. It is the custodian of the \r\nconscience of our Organization, and indeed of the whole of mankind. We look \r\nto the Council, and to this Organization, for transparency and eguity. We \r\nlook to the Security Council for protection and for steadfastness in upholding \r\nthe principles enshrined in the Charter. \r\nBecause the recommendation of the Security Council upon which the \r\nAssembly is being asked to base its decision contains no reference to specific \r\nacts of violation of the Charter of this Organization that would warrant this \r\ndrastic action against a Member State, my delegation will find it difficult to \r\nsupport such a decision by the General Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n168 \r\nMr. LEGWAILA (Botswana): The draft resolution before us is totally \r\ndevoid of any indication, nay any certainty, that what we will do tonight \r\nexclude Yugoslavia from the work of the forty-seventh session of the General \r\nAssembly - will contribute in any way to a solution to the tragic situation in \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. That is true particularly as it is so clear that what \r\nthe General Assembly is being asked to do tonight is not to exclude the \r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia from the forty-seventh session, but virtually \r\nto expel it from the United Nations: the virtual explusion of a country \r\nwhich, grudgingly, we admit is a Member of the United Nations. \r\nOtherwise there would have been no requirement in the draft resolution \\ \r\nfor Yugoslavia to apply for membership of the United Nations, starting in the \r\nSecurity Council, where the present action started, and ending in the General \r\nAssembly. In the Security Council, the application would have to run the \r\ngauntlet of the veto. No permanent member of the Security Council can say \r\nhere and now that it will not veto, that all they are looking for is that the \r\ncriteria for membership be met. \r\nYugoslavia\u0027s acts of commission or omission against Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina must be condemned without equivocation, without any mercy. Severe \r\npunishment for such un-peace-loving acts is in order. \r\nWe have very serious reservations, however, about the wisdom of the type \r\nof punishment we are about to mete out. I shudder to contemplate the state of \r\nmind in which the gunmen now laying siege to Sarajevo not to mention their \r\nsympathizers in Belgrade - will receive tonight\u0027s decision. Will they now \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n169-170 \r\n(Mr. Legwaila. Botswana) \r\nfeel they have nothing to lose if they intensify their murderous campaign \r\nagainst innocent men, women and children in Sarajevo and throughout the length \r\nand breadth of that tortured country? \r\nYugoslavia should be kept tightly in the clutches of the United Nations \r\nCharter by virtue of its membership of the Organization. It deserves no \r\nbreathing space on the sidelines, where, rightly or wrongly feeling wronged \r\nand persecuted, it can be more troublesome than it has been so far. \r\nIt is for those reasons that my delegation will vote the way it will \r\nvote - which will be seen on the voting board. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n171 \r\nMr. MWAANGA (Zambia): The General Assembly is about to take action \r\non a matter of grave consequence and historic significance. My delegation \r\nwould therefore like to take this opportunity to explain its vote before the \r\nvote is taken on the draft resolution contained in document A/47/L.1. \r\nLet me say from the outset that my delegation has very serious \r\nreservations about the text. Some of our concerns are about the indecent \r\nhaste with which this delegation is being asked to support a draft resolution \r\nover which no serious consultations took place prior to this afternoon. We \r\nbelieve that those of us who are not members of the Security Council and who \r\nare therefore not privy to the information which the Security Council had \r\nbefore it arrived at this decision should have been given an opportunity to \r\nconsult not only with the sponsors, but also with our Governments in order to \r\narrive at what we consider to be rational decisions. \r\nAttempts were made by some of the sponsors late this afternoon to consult \r\ndelegations. We are working against a time difference between New York and \r\nour respective capitals, and the fact that the sponsors of this draft \r\nresolution found themselves unable even to allow us the opportunity to consult \r\nour Governments on such an important decision, which has such fundamental \r\nbearing on the status of a founder Member of the United Nations, makes us \r\nbelieve that the sponsors had never seriously intended to consult with anyone \r\nand that it was in fact their wish to ensure that their draft resolution was \r\nadopted without consultation, without any debate, and without any changes to \r\nthe texts so as to accommodate the views of others. We find this approach to \r\ninternational relations unacceptable because it places some of the Member \r\nStates at a very, very serious disadvantage. \r\nWe also found that the sponsors lacked transparency in so far as their \r\nactual intentions were concerned in the sense that, instead of using the \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n172 \r\n(Mr. Mwaanga. Zambia) \r\nprovisions of the Charter that are adequate to allow either the expulsion or \r\nsuspension of a Member State or its rights, a much more clever formula was \r\nfound to evade this particular issue, through some clever drafting of a \r\nresolution that went through the Security Council process. \r\nWe are opposed to any measures which bypass the United Nations Charter, \r\nwe are opposed to measures which run parallel to the United Nations Charter, \r\nbecause we believe that it is part of our collective responsibility to act \r\nwithin the United Nations Charter to bring about solutions which are going to \r\nhave a salutary bearing on the conduct of international relations. \r\nWe therefore deeply regret this lack of consultation on such an important \r\ntext. We feel that it sets a very bad, indeed dangerous, precedent. We also \r\nwish to remind a number of Member States which are under a cloud from the \r\nUnited Nations, and particularly from the permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil that, by the adoption of the draft resolution before us they are going \r\nto be opening a Pandora\u0027s box that will be used liberally against Member \r\nStates by those who are going to be in charge of defining who should be and \r\nwho should not be a Member. This in our opinion is a very dangerous precedent. \r\nWe are concerned that the draft resolution before us is not based on the \r\nrelevant provisions of the Charter. We are also of the view that the argument \r\nthat Yugoslavia cannot automatically continue the membership of the former \r\nSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations is defective \r\nand unsustainable. We believe that the comparison of the situation in the \r\nformer Yugoslavia with the situation that prevailed in the former Soviet Union \r\nregarding automatic succession is irrelevant. This is so because the conflict \r\nsituation that has prevailed in the former Yugoslavia has not permitted the \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n173 \r\n(Mr. Mwaanga. Zambia) \r\nnecessary consultation and agreement among the republics and the tribal \r\ngroupings concerned on the issue of succession. \r\nIn making the recommendation contained in the first preambular paragraph \r\nof the draft resolution, it is incumbent on the Security Council to be \r\ncognizant of its grave responsibilities under the Charter and the importance \r\nof the question of membership in the United Nations. The Council should \r\nequally be cognizant of the overall authority of the General Assembly \r\nregarding the exercise of the rights and privileges of membership in \r\naccordance with the relevant Articles of the Charter. This is intended to \r\npreserve the democratic principles and practices governing the General \r\nAssembly and to prevent the imposition of the will of the minority or what I \r\nmight call the \"tyranny of the minority\" in this particular case. \r\nThe adoption of this draft resolution would in our view set a very \r\ndangerous precedent with grave implications for the interests of Member States \r\nand the credibility of the United Nations itself. The intentions behind the \r\ndraft resolution remain totally obscure and obstructionist to the ongoing \r\npeace process on the question of the former Yugoslavia. Our analysis of the \r\ntext, and in particular its operative paragraph 1, reveals that the effect of \r\nthis draft resolution is in fact to expel Yugoslavia, which is a Member State. \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, my delegation will find itself unable to \r\nsupport the draft resolution before us. In doing so, let me stress that we in \r\nno way condone the atrocities being perpetrated in Bosnia and Herzegovina or \r\nindeed any acts of violence being perpetrated by any of the parties to the \r\nconflict in the former Yugoslavia. We feel that the General Assembly and the \r\nUnited Nations family should be concentrating on finding a peaceful solution \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n174-175 \r\n(Mr. Mwaanga. Zambia) \r\nto what is obviously a very complex religious, ethnic and cultural problem \r\nthat requires a much deeper analysis and a much deeper understanding on our \r\npart. \r\nIt will be a sad day because, when all is said and done, history will \r\nrecord that when it mattered the most the General Assembly chose the easier \r\npath of expulsion. My delegation cannot subscribe to this view. \r\nMr. NYAKYI (United Republic of Tanzania): My delegation takes \r\nseriously all recommendations of the Security Council. In the discharge of \r\nits responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security, \r\nthe Council is entitled to receive the fullest possible cooperation from all \r\nMembers of the United Nations. It is therefore with a great deal of \r\nreluctance that my delegation has decided not to support the draft resolution \r\ncontained in document A/47/L.1, now before the General Assembly. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n176 \r\n(Mr. Nyakvi. United Republic \r\nof Tanzania) \r\nThere are several reasons why we are unhappy with the present draft \r\nresolution and the way in which this issue of the membership of Yugoslavia in \r\nthe United Nations has been handled. \r\nMembership in the United Nations is a serious matter. It is a \r\nfundamental right of States that subscribe to the purposes and principles of \r\nthe Charter. Depriving a State of its membership is therefore a very grave \r\nmatter which should not be taken lightly by the United Nations. We would have \r\nexpected the membership of the United Nations to be given an opportunity for a \r\nthorough discussion of the subject. As it is, the draft resolution was \r\ncirculated only on Saturday and the General Assembly is required to vote on it \r\ntoday. \r\nThe membership of the United Nations has not been given a convincing \r\nreason for the rush, which is designed to deprive us of the opportunity to \r\ndebate such a vitally important matter. Indeed, we have been offered no \r\nexplanation for the grave decision we are about to take. Secondly, it has \r\nbeen introduced under agenda item 8 on organization of work. It is too grave \r\na matter to discuss under this item. Thirdly, the Charter makes provision for \r\nthe membership of a State in the United Nations and for its termination or the \r\nexpulsion of an erring Member. Specifically, Articles 5 and 6 make provision \r\nfor the suspension and expulsion of an erring Member. \r\nThe effect of the present draft resolution is to deprive Yugoslavia of \r\nits membership in the United Nations. Yet its authors have preferred not to \r\nuse the relevant provisions of the Charter or any other law for the \r\nachievement of their objective. The draft resolution is thus based wholly on \r\npolitical considerations. In the view of my delegation, the United Nations is \r\nsetting a very dangerous and bad precedent. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n177 \r\n(Mr. Nyakyi. United Republic \r\nof Tanzania) \r\nWe will agree that the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \r\nhas disintegrated. But this is not the first time a State Member of the \r\nUnited Nations has broken apart. Since the founding of the United Nations, \r\nthree Member States have broken apart. In each case, the units that broke \r\naway from the main body applied for membership in the United Nations. The \r\nremaining entities were not required to reapply and their existence was never \r\nquestioned. Nor is this the first time a State Member of the United Nations \r\nhas changed its name. Several Member States have changed their names without \r\nhaving their membership in the Organization questioned. \r\nIn his Agenda for Peace, our Secretary-General has recommended more \r\nrecourse to the International Court of Justice in our efforts to resolve \r\nconflicts. At a time when we are all agreed that the rule of law is a \r\nprerequisite for the emerging world order, the status of our Organization \r\nwould have been greatly enhanced by our referring this matter to the \r\nInternational Court of Justice for an advisory opinion. My delegation \r\nbelieves that a reference to the International Court of Justice could have \r\nhelped to promote a consensus on this vitally important issue. It is a matter \r\nof great regret that this course of action has not even been given a thought \r\nby the sponsors of the draft resolution. \r\nFor these reasons, my delegation will be unable to support the draft \r\nresolution now under consideration. \r\nMr. MONGBE (Benin) (interpretation from French): The Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of Benin will at the appropriate time present \r\nto you. Sir, the greetings of the people and Government of Benin on your \r\nelection to the presidency of our Assembly. I am convinced that he would not \r\nbegrudge me this opportunity to express the satisfaction of the delegation of \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n178 \r\n(Mr. Monobe. Benin) \r\nBenin at seeing you, the representative of a new democracy with which Benin \r\nhas a great deal in common, occupying the prestigious position of President of \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\nThe act which I shall carry out in a few moments on behalf of my \r\ndelegation reguires some explanation. Benin, faithful to the spirit of the \r\nCharter, is in favour of international peace and is prepared to support any \r\ninitiative directed towards creating harmony between peoples within the same \r\nnation and between nations within the international community. My delegation \r\nif willing to believe, at the risk of sinning through naivety, that the draft \r\nresolution submitted for the General Assembly\u0027s consideration and likely \r\nadoption would create conditions of peace in all the States that made up the \r\nformer Yugoslavia. That is why my delegation is prepared to accept the idea \r\nthat none of the component parts of the former State of Yugoslavia can \r\nautomatically claim its succession. In the same spirit of justice and equity, \r\nthe delegation of Benin is also willing to believe that all the former \r\nfederated States of Yugoslavia - separate, independent entities today - have \r\nthe right to be admitted and to belong to the great human family of the United \r\nNations, and the General Assembly in particular. \r\nAccordingly, the possibility offered by the draft resolution contained in \r\ndocument A/47/L.1 for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Serbia and \r\nMontenegro to request admission, should not be deceptive. The credibility \r\nof our Organization hinges on this. My delegation and, I am sure, many others \r\nthat did not consider it necessary to speak on this occasion will judge the \r\nethics of our action through the subsequent conduct of certain delegations \r\nthat have initiated the draft resolution. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n179-180 \r\n(Mr. Mongbe. Benin) \r\nThe delegation of Benin believes that the establishment of lasting peace \r\nin that part of the world will depend on the sincere support offered by the \r\ninternational community to the peace process initiated at the London \r\nConference by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the European \r\nCommunity. The search for such peace must preclude any tendency towards the \r\npractice of ostracism. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n181 \r\n(Mr. Mongbe. Benin) \r\nI do not wish to be nor shall I be a prophet of doom, but I do believe \r\nthat any act committed in the heat of passion or to settle accounts and aimed \r\nat deceiving might turn the Balkans into a fearsome and genuine political \r\nvolcano. My delegation is counting on the sense of responsibility of all \r\ndelegations present here and would like to reflect the hope of the peoples of \r\nthe world to see peace established in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the other \r\nparts of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by calling upon \r\nall nations represented here to facilitate the achievement of peace by \r\nerecting no obstacle to the admission of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \r\nSerbia and Montenegro the United Nations. In other words, there will be no \r\nveto exercised. That is clear. \r\nIt is on this understanding and at this price and this price alone that \r\nmy delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution contained in \r\ndocument A/47/L.1. \r\nMr. ERDOS (Hungary) (interpretation from French): Hungary will vote \r\nin favour of the draft resolution contained in document A/47/L.1. The \r\nposition of Hungary on this matter is reflected in the central element of the \r\ndraft resolution: the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Serbia and Montenegro \r\ncannot be the automatic successor in the United Nations of the former \r\nSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which has ceased to exist, and \r\ntherefore the authorities in Belgrade must present a reguest for admission to \r\nmembership in our world Organization. \r\nHungary believes that such unilateral declarations as that published in \r\nBelgrade on 27 April, cannot constitute a legal basis for a decision on the \r\nstatus of the ex-Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in international \r\norganizations, and that the problems of membership in the United Nations \r\nshould be settled only on the basis of a common agreement accepted by all the \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n182 \r\n(Mr. Erdb\u0027s. Hungary) \r\nStates successors to the former Yugoslavia. In the absence of such an \r\nagreement, the future status in the United Nations of the Federal Republic of \r\nYugoslavia Serbia and Montenegro cannot differ from that of the other \r\nformer Yugoslav republics, three of which have already been admitted to \r\nmembership of the United Nations as independent and sovereign States. \r\nIn our view, it is indispensable that when the Federal Republic of \r\nYugoslavia Serbia and Montenegro decides to present to the United Nations \r\na request for admission to membership, that request be dealt with on the basis \r\nof the same criteria that guided us during the admission to membership of the \r\nUnited Nations of other States successors to the former Yugoslav federation, \r\nalso taking account of developments in the region. \r\nIn political terms and I emphasize political - the draft resolution \r\nsubmitted is in reality only the logical result of the judgement which the \r\ninternational community has constantly brought to be bear on the situation \r\nthat has emerged in the field, a judgement that has been reflected in a number \r\nof resolutions adopted by the Security Council, namely, that the primary \r\nresponsibility for the bloody events that have been laying waste the territory \r\nof the former Yugoslavia for a year and a half must undeniably be borne by the \r\nauthorities in Belgrade. This evening, it is impossible to ignore the \r\natrocities and wanton destruction committed in the former Yugoslavia, acts \r\nthat are almost impossible to imagine taking place in those lands at the end \r\nof the twentieth century. It is also difficult to escape the effects of \r\nbitterness, frustration and disillusion that we have all felt during this \r\nperiod. \r\nAnd yet, at this stage of events we are convinced that we must look to \r\nthe future. We must seek out what can bring us out of this conflict and \r\nrestore peace to the peoples of that region, to the Serbs as well as to \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n183-185 \r\n(Mr. Erdos. Hungary) \r\nCroats and Muslims, and to the other nations of the former Yugoslavia, \r\nincluding its ethnic minorities. We hope that the leaders of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia - Serbia and Montenegro will be able to draw the \r\nnecessary consequences from the General Assembly\u0027s decision this evening, and \r\nthat they will be able to translate them into action in their international \r\nand regional activities most particularly within the framework of the London \r\nConference in full respect for democratic values, human rights, and the \r\nrights of minorities. \r\nIn this enterprise, Hungary, as a State Member of the United Nations, a \r\ncountry of the region, and a neighbour linked to the southern Slavic peoples \r\nby countless ties forged in a long history of cohabitation, urges perseverance \r\nand expresses its every wish of success to Prime Minister Panic and to all \r\nthose in Serbia who claim to be committed to the cause of a just and lasting \r\npeace in the region and who are sparing no efforts to ensure that the dark \r\nforces of hatred, exclusion and ethnic cleansing be eliminated and that \r\ndemocracy, tolerance and respect for diversity and each other\u0027s rights prevail \r\nin these wounded lands. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: We have just heard the last speaker in explanation \r\nof vote before the voting. \r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft resolution A/47/L.1. In \r\nconnection with draft resolution A/47/L.1, I would like to announce that \r\nBangladesh has become a sponsor. \r\nA recorded vote has been reguested. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n186 \r\nA recorded vote was taken. \r\nIn favour: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, \r\nArgentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, \r\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, Benin, \r\nBhutan, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brunei Darussalam, \r\nBulgaria, Burkina Faso, Canada, Cape Verde, Chile, Colombia, \r\nComoros, Congo, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechoslovakia, \r\nDenmark, Djibouti, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia, \r\nFiji, Finland, France, Gabon, Gambia, Germany, Greece, \r\nGrenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Honduras, \r\nHungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), \r\nIreland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, \r\nKyrgyzstan, Lao People\u0027s Democratic Republic, Latvia, \r\nLiberia, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, \r\nLuxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, \r\nMalta, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Mauritius, Micronesia \r\n(Federated States of), Mongolia, Morocco, Nepal, \r\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, \r\nOman, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, \r\nPortugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Republic of Moldova, \r\nRomania, Russian Federation, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, San Marino, Saudi \r\nArabia, Senegal, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Sudan, \r\nSuriname, Sweden, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, \r\nTurkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States \r\nof America, Uruguay, Vanuatu, Yemen \r\nAgainst: Kenya, Swaziland, United Republic of Tanzania, \r\nZambia, Zimbabwe \r\nYugoslavia, \r\nAbstaining: Angola, Bahamas, Botswana, Brazil, Burundi, Cameroon, China, \r\n\\ Cote d\u0027lvoire, Cuba, Ghana, Guyana, India, Irag, Jamaica, \r\nLebanon, Lesotho, Mexico, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, \r\nPapua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Togo, Uganda, Viet Nam, Zaire \r\nDraft resolution A/47/L.1 was adopted by 127 votes to 6. with \r\n26 abstentions (resolution 47/1). \r\n* Subseguently, the delegations of Saint Lucia and Lebanon advised the \r\nSecretariat that they had intended to vote in favour. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n187 \r\nThe PRESIDENT: I shall now call on those representatives who wish \r\nto explain their votes. \r\nMay I remind delegations that, in accordance with General Assembly \r\ndecision 34/401, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats. \r\nMr. ABDULLA SHAHIP (Maldives): My delegation supported draft \r\nresolution A/47/L.1 on the basis that there is no agreement among the \r\nrepublics that comprised the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \r\nconcerning the status of the original United Nations seat of the Socialist \r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia. Hence, in the absence of such an agreement, \r\nMaldives is unable to accept the claim of the Federal Republic of \r\nYugoslavia Serbia-Montenegro to that seat. \r\nThe Maldives co-sponsored and supported resolutions admitting the newly \r\nindependent States of Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina to the \r\nUnited Nations. In this context, we shall support the membership of the \r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia when its application comes before the Assembly. \r\nThe Maldives\u0027 support for this resolution is also based on the \r\nunderstanding that it does not affect bilateral diplomatic relations between \r\nMember States and the republics of former Yugoslavia. \r\nMr. M0NTAN0 (Mexico) (interpretation from Spanish): Mexico has \r\ngiven careful consideration to the draft resolution just adopted, as well as \r\nto the overall situation in the territory of the former Socialist Federal \r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. My delegation did not vote in favour of the draft \r\nresolution for the following reasons. \r\nIn the first place, we consider that the complex and sensitive situation \r\nin former Yugoslavia, the most painful manifestation of which is the tragedy \r\ntaking place in Bosnia and Herzegovina, requires exertion of the greatest \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n188 \r\n(Mr. Montano. Mexico) \r\npossible efforts to bring about a political solution negotiated between the \r\nparties to the conflict. In our view, the isolation of one of those parties, \r\nirrespective of whether there are reasons for singling it out as the one \r\nbearing the greater share of responsibility, will make that solution more \r\ndifficult to achieve. \r\nAt the same time, we express our concern at the consequences this action \r\nmay have for the future discharge of its task by the United Nations Protection \r\nForce, which is an essential element in the achievement of peace in former \r\nYugoslavia. \r\nMoreover, we are concerned that the text of the resolution contains \r\nnothing that would indicate its basis in law. The Charter of the United \r\nNations makes no provision for the issue of the breakup and subsequent \r\nsuccession of States. On previous occasions the Security Council has, \r\ntherefore, tacitly recognized the automatic replacement of the whole by one \r\npart, or has admitted the new Members that emerged from the breakup. \r\nThe resolution just adopted is of a different kind; it finds no support \r\nin Articles 4, 5 or 6 of the Charter, dealing with the conditions for \r\nmembership in the United Nations and with suspension or expulsion therefrom. \r\nThus, it has shortcomings from the legal standpoint which we find of concern \r\nat a time when the rapid changes in the political map of the world compel us \r\nto be careful to preserve the rules of international law. \r\nThe Government of Mexico considers that all aspects of the question of \r\nsuccession of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia should be \r\ndealt with in the framework of the London Conference and resolved by means of \r\nan agreement among the parts of which that State was composed. In any event, \r\nit is our hope that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia - Serbia and \r\nMontenegro will shortly rejoin the United Nations community by means of the \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n189 \r\n(Mr. Montano. Mexico) \r\napplication for admission referred to in the resolution just adopted and in \r\naccordance with Article 4 of the Charter. \r\nIn conclusion, I should like to express, once again, the solidarity of \r\nthe people and Government of Mexico with the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nwhose suffering is a matter of concern to the whole international community. \r\nMr. SARDENBERG (Brazil): Brazil has been following with close \r\nattention and great concern all the aspects related to the developments in the \r\nsituation in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and we \r\nremain ready to support efforts to achieve a peaceful solution to the conflict. \r\nReasons for special anguish to us are the dire conditions afflicting the \r\ncivilian population of that region, the intolerable breaches of basic human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, and the recrudescence of dreadful practices \r\nbased on ethnic grounds. Brazil rejects outright such abhorrent attitudes. \r\nHaving said that, let me refer to the two reasons that have compelled my \r\ndelegation to abstain in the vote on the draft resolution contained in \r\ndocument A/47/L.1. \r\nIn the first place, it is still our firm belief that the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations remains the paramount document governing our existence as an \r\norganization based on law. Therefore, the Charter, the actual constitution of \r\nthis Organization, should not be overlooked. Questions related to admission, \r\nparticipation, suspension or expulsion affect the most basic rights of States \r\nin relation to the Organization, and should therefore be dealt with with the \r\nutmost care and attention, bearing in mind the fundamental need to follow the \r\nCharter strictly. \r\nThe treatment of such matters should certainly benefit from the \r\nappropriate degree of reliability, predictability and transparency, as well as \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n190 \r\n(Mr. Sardenbero. Brazil) \r\nfrom clear reference to the provisions of the Charter and of the rules of \r\nprocedure which it is intended to apply. \r\nAn overly imaginative interpretation of the Charter may lead to the \r\nweakening of the solid legal structure upon which the functioning of the \r\nUnited Nations is based. It has even been asserted, lately, that the Charter \r\nnow seems to be undergoing a process of informal revision. We are concerned \r\nthat Member States are ever more freguently faced with the feeling of being \r\nrushed into decisions on important matters on fluid or questionable legal \r\ngrounds. \r\nSecondly, let me stress that Brazil attaches the highest priority to the \r\npromotion of peaceful settlement of disputes, and, to this end, advocates the \r\nfull use of the diplomatic potential of the United Nations as a universal \r\nforum for dialogue and understanding. We are not convinced that exclusion \r\nfrom the General Assembly of any one of the parties to the conflict in the \r\nformer Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will in any way be helpful to \r\nthe peace efforts currently being undertaken. \r\nWe should also bear in mind the potentially negative impact of such a \r\ndecision on the ability of the United Nations Protection Force to fulfil its \r\nincreasingly complex tasks, as well as on the physical of its multinational \r\npersonnel. \r\nIn the light of those considerations, my delegation was not in a position \r\nto support the draft resolution before us, and abstained. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n191 \r\nMr. AGUILAR (Guatemala) (interpretation from Spanish): The \r\ndelegation of Guatemala voted in favour of the draft resolution contained in \r\ndocument A/47/L.1, taking into account the decision of the Security Council \r\nand the humanitarian arguments which obliged the Council to adopt that \r\ndecision indeed, the same arguments that motivated this decision by the \r\nGeneral Assembly. However, we feel that we must clarify our position. \r\nThis case, for Guatemala, does not constitute nor should it \r\nconstitute a precedent in United Nations practice which could be applied in \r\nfuture. We note that in similar cases of the breakup of States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations, this requirement was not imposed. This could mean selective \r\napplication to specific cases, and we reject this. \r\nGuatemala also believes that this resolution is a measure that calls into \r\nquestion the principle of universal participation, which is one of the main \r\nbastions of the United Nations. The delegation of Guatemala feels that it \r\nwould have been desirable to have had more time so that it could have had the \r\nbenefit of a legal opinion from the Department of Legal Affairs and thus been \r\nclear about the legal basis of this decision and its possible implications in \r\nrespect of the interpretation of the Charter. \r\nGuatemala reaffirms its commitment to the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand to the necessity of preserving the principles of international law that \r\nhave been forged over the years. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n192 \r\nMrs, des ILES (Trinidad and Tobago): Trinidad and Tobago voted in \r\nfavour of the resolution just adopted by the General Assembly. In doing so, \r\nwe were not unmindful of the complex legal aspects of the decision before us \r\nand of the difficulties that may well ensue of the possible precedent being \r\nset. \r\nHowever, the overriding consideration which determined our affirmative \r\nvote was the need to send a strong message to the Federal Government of \r\nYugoslavia regarding respect for, and the protection of, human rights. We \r\nalso wished to indicate, in positive terms, the full support of the Government \r\nof Trinidad and Tobago for international action to be taken to resolve the \r\ncrisis in the former State of Yugoslavia, and to prevent an escalation which \r\ncould all too easily spill over and embroil neighbouring States. \r\nMr. NEAGU (Romania): Romania voted in favour of the resolution that \r\nhas just been adopted although we are not fully convinced that in the present \r\nconditions this is the best move to be undertaken. First of all, the process \r\nof negotiations unleashed by the recent London Conference on former Yugoslavia \r\nis under way, with certain improved prospects after the visit of the two \r\nco-Chairmen, Mr. Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, to the area. \r\nAlso, we have all been encouraged by the peace programme presented by \r\nPrime Minister Milan Panic. Moreover, the very vocation of the United Nations \r\nis its universality in order to fulfil its responsibilities. It is our \r\nconviction that a peaceful solution to the Yugoslav crisis can be found only \r\nthrough political dialogue with the participation, on an equal footing, of all \r\nthe parties concerned. \r\nIn this respect, we appreciate the fact that the resolution does not \r\nprovide for either the suspension or the exclusion of Yugoslavia from the \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n193 \r\n(Mr. Neagu. Romania) \r\nUnited Nations. The decision that Yugoslavia shall not participate in the \r\nwork of the General Assembly does not preclude its participation in other \r\nUnited Nations organs, including the Security Council. \r\nAnother important element of the resolution is its invitation to the \r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia to apply for membership in the United Nations. \r\nWe hope that this provision also implies the desire to have the new Yugoslavia \r\nin the United Nations. In any case, I can assure the Assembly that Romania \r\nwill strive for that positive outcome. \r\nMs. MAIR (Jamaica): Jamaica abstained in the vote on the resolution \r\nbefore us, and our reasons are as follows. \r\nThe recommendation of the Security Council is based on the assertion that \r\nthe Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has ceased to exist, as stated in \r\nthe relevant Security Council resolution. An assertion is, by definition, a \r\nconclusion of fact and of law requiring the presentation and consideration of \r\nthe relevant facts and the legal principles to support such a conclusion. \r\nHowever, no such facts have been stated in support of this conclusion and, as \r\nfar as our delegation is aware, no authoritative legal opinion has been sought \r\nand obtained from the legal advisers of the United Nations and made available \r\nto the General Assembly for its consideration of a matter of such fundamental \r\nimportance. \r\nTherefore, we ask: where is the legal opinion on which to base a \r\nreasoned and responsible decision? In these circumstances, we are unable to \r\nform a rational opinion as to whether the assertion on which this resolution \r\nis based is one which we can either support or reject. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n194-195 \r\n(Ms. Mair. Jamaica) \r\nWe do wish, however, to make it clear that our abstention does not mean \r\nthat we either condone or view lightly the atrocities that have been committed \r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina, and we support strongly any condemnation of those \r\nresponsible for such atrocities once such responsibility has been clearly \r\nestablished. \r\nWe do, however, have the most serious reservations, indeed objection, to \r\na procedure such as the one that has been adopted, and the manner in which the \r\nSecurity Council has proceeded to present this to the General Assembly. We \r\nare concerned that a dangerous precedent is being established which could \r\nreturn to haunt this Organization. For these reasons, our delegation \r\nabstained. \r\nMr. INSANALLY (Guyana): Like many other delegations in the \r\nAssembly, Guyana had great concern about the lack of a clear legal basis for \r\nthe resolution that has just been adopted. We were hard put, in the \r\ncircumstances, to understand fully its legal implications and possible \r\nconseguences. Standing as it does against the background of Articles 5 and \r\n6 of the Charter, which deal, respectively, with suspension and expulsion, \r\nthis important measure should have been at least in our view appropriately \r\nclothed with legal argument. \r\nThe text purports to convey the view of the members of the Security \r\nCouncil on the right of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that is, Serbia \r\nand Montenegro to a seat in the General Assembly. The Council may have \r\nindeed had compelling reasons for making this recommendation to the Assembly; \r\nhowever, since we - and, certainly, my delegation have not been privy to the \r\nCouncil\u0027s thinking, my delegation had to exercise some caution at this time. \r\nA/47/PV.7 \r\n196 \r\n(Mr. Insanally. Guyana) \r\nWe would certainly have wished to have some guidance, perhaps from the \r\nLegal Counsel of this Organization, to be able to determine the full import of \r\nthe recommendation put to us this evening. In the absence of such guidance, \r\nand because of our lingering doubts, we were obliged to abstain in the vote \r\nand this we did, like so many others, for fear that an acceptance might come \r\nback one day to haunt us. \r\nFinally, let me make it clear that Guyana fully condemns the doctrine and \r\npractice of \"ethnic cleansing\". We very much regret, therefore, that the \r\nissue has arisen in this confused and confusing context. \r\nThe PRESIDENT: We have concluded this stage of our consideration of \r\nagenda item 8. I thank representatives for their participation in the work of \r\nthe General Assembly during this very long day. \r\nThe meeting rose at 10.20 p.m. \r\n"
